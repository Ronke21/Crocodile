<text>Cad Goddeu (, ) is a medieval Welsh poem preserved in the 14th-century manuscript known as the Book of Taliesin. The poem refers to a traditional story in which the legendary enchanter Gwydion animates the trees of the forest to fight as his army. The poem is especially notable for its striking and enigmatic symbolism and the wide variety of interpretations this has occasioned.

==Poem==
Some 248 short lines long (usually five syllables and a rest), and falling into several sections, the poem begins with an extended claim of first-hand knowledge of all things, in a fashion found later in the poem and also in several others attributed to Taliesin;
culminating in a claim to have been at &quot;Caer Vevenir&quot; when the Lord of Britain did battle. There follows an account of a great monstrous beast, of the fear of the Britons and how, by Gwydion&#x27;s skill and the grace of God, the trees marched to battle: then follows a list of plants, each with some outstanding attribute, now apt, now obscure;
The poem then breaks into a first-person account of the birth of the flower-maiden Blodeuwedd, and then the history of another one, a great warrior, once a herdsman, now a learned traveller, perhaps Arthur or Taliesin himself. After repeating an earlier reference to the Flood, the Crucifixion and the day of judgment, the poem closes with an obscure reference to metalwork.

==Interpretations==
There are contemporary passing allusions to the Battle of Trees elsewhere in the medieval Welsh collections: The Welsh Triads record it as a &quot;frivolous&quot; battle, while in another poem of the &quot;Book of Taliesin&quot; the poet claims to have been present at the battle.

According to a summary of a similar story preserved in Peniarth MS 98B (which dates from the late sixteenth century) the poem describes a battle between Gwydion and Arawn, the Lord of Annwn. The fight broke out after the divine plowman Amaethon stole a dog, a lapwing, and a roebuck from Arawn. Gwydion ultimately triumphed by guessing the name of one of Arawn&#x27;s men, Bran (possibly Bran the Blessed).

In the Mabinogi story of the childhood of Lleu Llaw Gyffes, Gwydion makes a forest appear to be an invading force.

The &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot;, which is difficult to translate because of its laconic allusiveness and grammatical ambiguity, was the subject of several nineteenth-century speculative commentaries and English renderings. Thomas Stephens held the poem to concern &quot;a Helio-Arkite superstition, the metempsychosis of a Chief Druid, and a symbolical account of the Deluge&quot;. Gerald Massey&#x27;s monumental work on African origins suggested that the poem reflected Egyptian religion.

David William Nash believed it was a poor-quality twelfth-century romance overlaying a romance or story of the Arthurian era and put together with other poetic fragments. W. F. Skene rejected the antiquity of the prose account and thought the poem reflected the history of the north country during the Irish incursions. Watson followed Skene and Ifor Williams posed the question &#x27;What about the Battle of Celyddon Wood?&#x27;

Robert Graves took up a speculation that had been considered and rejected by Nash; that the trees that fought in the battle correspond to the Ogham alphabet, in which each character is associated with a particular tree. Each tree had a meaning and significance of its own, and Gwydion guessed Bran&#x27;s name by the alder branch Bran carried, the alder being one of Bran&#x27;s prime symbols. Graves argued that the original poet had concealed druidic secrets about an older matriarchal Celtic religion for fear of censure from Christian authorities. He suggested that Arawn and Bran were names for the same underworld god and that the battle was probably not physical but rather a struggle of wits and scholarship: Gwydion&#x27;s forces could only be defeated if the name of his companion, Lady Achren (&quot;Trees&quot;), was guessed and Arawn&#x27;s host only if Bran&#x27;s name was guessed.

Graves, following Nash, accepted that the poem is a composite of several different sections, among which he named a &quot;Hanes Taliesin&quot; (&quot;History of Taliesin&quot;) and a &quot;Hanes Blodeuwedd&quot; (History of Blodeuwedd).

Marged Haycock and Mary Ann Constantine reject the idea that &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot; encodes ancient pagan religions as Graves believed but rather see it as a burlesque, a grand parody of bardic language. Francesco Bennozo argues that the poem represents ancient fears of the forest and its magical powers. Trudy Carmany Last suggests that &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot; is a Celtic variant of Virgil’s &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

==Other uses==
A track titled &quot;Cad Goddeau&quot; appears on the 1984 album &quot;Eostre&quot; by the British band Zoviet France. 

Singer-songwriter Tori Amos was inspired by the story of &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot; for her song &quot;Battle of Trees&quot;, which appears on &quot;Night of Hunters&quot;, a narrative concept album, presented as a 21st-century song cycle. This song, a variation on Erik Satie&#x27;s &quot;Gnossienne No. 1&quot;, uses references to &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot; to reflect on the power of language as a battle-ready weapon.

Soviet and later Russian rock group Aquarium recorded a song &quot;Kad Goddo&quot; on their album &quot;Deti Dekabrya&quot;, 1986, quoting some of the lines directly from the poem.

Tim Powers has the protagonist of his book &quot;The Drawing of the Dark&quot;, Brian Duffy, utter a few verses of the &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot; to evoke ancient beings to fight with him.

&quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; is a musical theme recurring in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy and the expanded universe. It was composed by John Williams and recorded for the film soundtrack by the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Voices. This symphonic piece is played with both a full orchestra and a choir. The lyrics are based on a fragment of &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot;, and sung in Sanskrit.

<text>Guy Takeo Kawasaki (born August 30, 1954) is an American marketing specialist, author, and Silicon Valley venture capitalist. He was one of the Apple employees originally responsible for marketing their Macintosh computer line in 1984. He popularized the word &quot;evangelist&quot; in marketing the Macintosh as an &quot;Apple evangelist&quot; and the concepts of evangelism marketing and technology evangelism/platform evangelism in general.

From March 2015 until December 2016, Kawasaki sat on the board of trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit operating entity of Wikipedia.

Kawasaki has also written fifteen books, including &quot;The Macintosh Way&quot; (1990), &quot;The Art of the Start&quot; (2004), and &quot;Wise Guy: Lessons from a Life&quot; (2019).

== Early life and education ==
Guy Kawasaki was born in Honolulu, Hawaii to Duke Takeshi Kawasaki (d. 2015) and Aiko Kawasaki. His family lived in an area outside Honolulu called Kalihi Valley. His father, Duke, once served as a fireman, real estate broker, state senator, and government official while his mother was a housewife. He attended ʻIolani School and graduated in 1972.

Kawasaki graduated from Stanford University in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology. He then attended law school at UC Davis, but quit after about a week of classes when he realized that he disliked law school. In 1977, he enrolled in the UCLA Anderson School of Management, where he earned an MBA degree. While there, Kawasaki also worked at a jewelry company, Nova Stylings. Kawasaki observed, &quot;The jewelry business is a very, very tough business, tougher than the computer business... I learned a very valuable lesson: how to sell.&quot;

== Career ==

In 1983, Kawasaki got a job at Apple through his Stanford roommate, Mike Boich. He was Apple&#x27;s chief evangelist for four years. In a 2006 podcast interview on the online site Venture Voice, Kawasaki said, &quot;What got me to leave is basically I started listening to my own hype, and I wanted to start a software company and really make big bucks.&quot; In 1987 he was hired to lead ACIUS, the U.S. subsidiary of France-based ACI, which published an Apple database software system called 4th Dimension.

Kawasaki left ACIUS in 1989 to further his writing and speaking career. In the early 1990s he wrote columns that were featured in &quot;Forbes&quot; and &quot;MacUser&quot; magazines. He also founded another company, Fog City Software, which created Emailer, an email client that sold to Claris. A collection of namesake software utilities called &quot;Guy&#x27;s Utilities for Macintosh&quot; (GUM), was published by After Hours Software in the early 1990s. An edition of GUM for PowerBook systems was acquired by Gordon Eubanks and was subsequently remarketed by Symantec as &quot;The Norton Essentials for PowerBook&quot;.

He returned to Apple as an Apple Fellow in 1995. In 1998, he was a co-founder of Garage Technology Ventures, a venture capital firm that has made investments in Pandora Radio, Tripwire, The Motley Fool and D.light Design. In 2007, he founded Truemors, a free-flow rumor mill, that sold to NowPublic. He is also a founder at Alltop, an online magazine rack.

In March 2013, Kawasaki joined Google as an advisor to Motorola. His role was to create a Google+ mobile device community.

In April 2014, Kawasaki became the chief evangelist of Canva. It is a free graphic design website for non-designers as well as professionals and was founded in January 2013.

On March 24, 2015, Kawasaki joined Wikimedia Foundation&#x27;s . He stepped down at the end of December 2016.

On April 25, 2017, WikiTribune mentioned him as an adviser.

On February 26, 2019, Penguin Group released &quot;Wise Guy&quot;, described as Kawasaki&#x27;s most personal book to date. While the book is written as what could be considered a memoir, it contains a series of vignettes that include various personal experiences that Kawasaki says have enlightened and inspired him.

In December 2019, Kawasaki created a podcast called Remarkable People. There are now over 90 episodes available including interviews with Jane Goodall, Stephen Wolfram, Andrew Yang and Sal Khan. Kawasaki has stated that he believed the podcast was his best and most under appreciated work.

== Personal life ==
Kawasaki and his wife have four children: Nicodemus (&quot;Nic&quot;), Noah, Nohemi, and Nate. Nohemi and Nate are biological siblings whom the couple adopted from Guatemala.

<text>In Norse mythology, a dís (Old Norse: , &quot;lady&quot;, plural [[Dís|dísir]] ) is a female deity, ghost, or spirit associated with Fate who can be either benevolent or antagonistic toward mortals. Dísir may act as protective spirits of Norse clans. It is possible that their original function was that of fertility goddesses who were the object of both private and official worship called dísablót, and their veneration may derive from the worship of the spirits of the dead. The dísir, like the valkyries, norns, and vættir, are always referred collectively in surviving references. The North Germanic dísir and West Germanic Idisi are believed by some scholars to be related due to linguistic and mythological similarities, but the direct evidence of Anglo-Saxon and Continental German mythology is limited. The dísir play roles in Norse texts that resemble those of fylgjur, valkyries, and norns, so that some have suggested that dísir is a broad term including the other beings.

==Etymology and meaning==
Researchers suggest that the basic meaning of the word dís is &quot;goddess&quot;.

It usually is said to be derived from the Indo-European root *&quot;dhēi-&quot;, &quot;to suck, suckle&quot; and a form &quot;dhīśana&quot;.

Scholars have associated the Dísir with the West Germanic Idisi, seeing the initial &quot;i-&quot; as having been lost early in Old or Proto-Norse. Jacob Grimm points out that &quot;dís Skjöldunga&quot; in the Eddic Helgakviða Hundingsbana II (v. 52) is exactly parallel to &quot;ides Scildinga&quot; &quot;Scylding queen&quot; in Beowulf (l. 1168). He also suggests that Iðunn may be a reflex of the original form of the word. However, except for the First Merseburg Charm, in which they work battle-magic, &quot;idis&quot; only occurs with the meaning &quot;lady&quot;, sometimes &quot;maiden.&quot; The words are not presumed to be directly related by some scholars, although the resemblance evidently led to influence on Old Norse poetic use.

Other scholars group all female deities and spirits associated with battle under the class of idis, dis, valkyrie, and other names, such as sigewif (victory-women, associated by the Anglo-Saxons with a swarm of bees), and find the commonalities both linguistically and in surviving myths and magic charms sufficient cause to group together all variations on this theme from various Germanic cultures.

Stories from these and other cultures survive from earlier dates than the Eddas and it is difficult to conclusively construct a clear pre-Christian mythology without conjecture. However, the Germanic languages appear to have had a northward, rather than southward, progression from the initial contact with the speakers of Indo-European languages near Denmark or Jutland. H. Davidson notes a similar northward progression of mythology where elements of Proto-Germanic concepts have metamorphosed or been combined by the time of the initial recording of the Icelandic sagas.

According to Rudolf Simek, Old Norse &quot;dís&quot; appears commonly as simply a term for &#x27;woman&#x27;, just as Old High German &quot;itis&quot;, Old Saxon &quot;idis&quot;, and Anglo-Saxon &quot;ides&quot;. It also may have been used to denote a type of goddess. According to Simek, &quot;several of the Eddic sources might lead us to conclude that the &quot;disir&quot; were valkyrie-like guardians of the dead, and, indeed, in &quot;Guðrúnarkviða&quot; I 19 the valkyries are even called &quot;Herjans disir&quot; &#x27;Odin&#x27;s disir&#x27;. The &quot;disir&quot; are explicitly called dead women in &quot;Atlamál&quot; 28. A secondary belief that the &quot;disir&quot; were the souls of dead women (see &quot;fylgjur&quot;) also underlies the &quot;landdísir&quot; of Icelandic folklore.&quot;

Simek says that &quot;as the function of the matrons was also extremely varied – fertility goddess, personal guardians, but also warrior-goddesses – the belief in the &quot;dísir&quot;, like the belief in the valkyries, norns, and matrons, may be considered to be different manifestations of a belief in a number of female (half-?) goddesses.&quot;

==Dísablót==
There is considerable evidence that the dísir were worshipped in Scandinavia in pagan times.

Firstly, a sacrificial festival (blót) honouring them, the &quot;dísablót&quot;, is mentioned in one version of &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks konungs&quot; and in &quot;Víga-Glúms saga&quot;, &quot;Egils saga&quot;, and the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. According to &quot;Víga-Glúms saga&quot; it was held at Winter Nights (at the onset of winter).

In &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, the dísablót is also held in autumn, and is performed by a woman, the daughter of King Álfr of Álfheim, who &quot;reddens the &quot;hörgr&quot; with sacrifices and is subsequently rescued by the god Thor after she has been abducted. John Lindow suggests that, on its face the text depicts a mythological model for human behavior. In western Scandinavia, dísablót appears to have been a private observance. Even the large gathering in &quot;Víga-Glúms saga&quot; was for family and friends.

In contrast, according to the &quot;Saga of St. Olaf&quot; in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, at Gamla Uppsala the dísablót was celebrated during the month of Gói, i.e. in late February or early March, and accompanied by a popular assembly known as the Thing of all Swedes or &quot;Dísaþing&quot; and a yearly fair. When Christianity arrived, the assembly and market were moved to a Christian feast at the beginning of February:

At the time when heathendom still prevailed in Sweden, it was an old custom there that the main sacrifices were held in Uppsala in the month of Gói... Sacrifices were to be made at that time for peace and victory for the king, and people from all over Sweden were to resort there. At that place and time also was to be the assembly of all Swedes, and there was also a market and a fair which lasted a week. Now when Christianity was introduced, the general assembly and the market were still held there. But at present, when Christianity is general in Sweden and the kings have ceased residing at Uppsala, the market has been shifted to meet at Candlemas... but now it lasts only three days. The general assembly of the Swedes is there.

The name Dísaþing (now &quot;Disting&quot;) remained in use, however, and the Fair is still held every year in Uppsala on the first Tuesday in February. It may be one of the oldest in Sweden.

The stated purpose of the dísablót at Uppsala is to sacrifice for peace and victory. Norwegian places called &quot;Disin&quot;, from Old Norse &quot;Dísavin&quot;, &quot;meadow of the dísir&quot;, and the possible relationship of the word to the Indian &quot;dhīsanas&quot; have suggested to some scholars that the dísir were fertility deities.

There are two mentions of a hall or temple of a dís. Hollander translates &quot;dísarsálr&quot; as &quot;the hall of the goddess&quot;. In the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; part of &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, Aðils, the king of Sweden, dies when he rides one of his horses around the &quot;dísarsálr&quot; at the time of Dísablót and he is thrown and brains himself on a rock, perhaps suggesting a ritual killing. It also appears in &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; where Helga becomes so infuriated over the death of her father at the hands of Heiðrekr, her husband, that she hangs herself in the shrine.

Although Snorri Sturluson does not mention the dísir in the Prose Edda, he does list &quot;Vanadís&quot;—&#x27;dís of the Vanir&#x27;— as a name for Freyja, and &quot;öndurdís&quot;—&#x27;snow-shoe dís&#x27;—as a name for Skaði. He notes that in both cases the compound using dís immediately follows one using &quot;goð&quot;, &#x27;deity&#x27;: &quot;Vanagoð&quot;, &quot;öndurgoð&quot;. Lotte Motz suggested that dís was the original Old Norse word for &#x27;goddess&#x27; and that it had been replaced later by &quot;ásynja&quot;, which is simply the feminine of áss.

==Relationship to other female figures==
In many texts, the dísir are equated to or seem to play the same role as other female figures.

In &quot;Þiðranda þáttr ok Þórhalls&quot;, the youth Þiðrandi is killed by dísir dressed in black, riding black horses, while a troop of dísir dressed in white and riding white horses are unable to save him. The two groups represent the struggle between heathenry and Christianity. The benevolent dísir here play the role of tutelary spirits associated with a family, and Thorhall the Prophet explains them as &quot;fylgjur&quot;. The dísir are also referred to as if they are, or include, protective fylgjur in an exchange of verses in &quot;Hálfs saga ok Hálfsrekka&quot;. Útsteinn quarrels with Úlfr at the court of King Eysteinn of Denmark, saying he believes &quot;our dísir&quot; have come with him, armed, to Denmark. Úlfr replies that he thinks all the dísir of Útsteinn and his men are dead and their luck run out.

In &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot;, when the hero Helgi Hundingsbane first meets the valkyrie Sigrún, the poet calls her a &quot;dís of the south&quot;. Henry Adams Bellows rendered this simply &quot;the southern maid&quot;.

The dísir are also equated with or play the role of norns. They give an impression of great age, but by the time of the oldest surviving texts, their significance had become blurred and the word had lost almost all distinct meaning.

Accordingly, some scholars have argued that &quot;dísir&quot; may be the original term for the valkyries (lit. &quot;choosers of the slain&quot;), which in turn would be a kenning for &quot;dís&quot;. Unlike the mentions of the &quot;valkyrja&quot; and &quot;norn&quot;, the term &quot;dís&quot; never appears in the Prose Edda by Snorri Sturluson.

As stated above, &quot;dís&quot; has been regarded as cognate with Old High German &quot;itis&quot;, Old Saxon &quot;idis&quot; and the Anglo-Saxon &quot;ides&quot;, all meaning &quot;lady&quot;,; and &quot;idisi&quot; appears as the name of the valkyries in the only surviving pagan source from Germany, the &quot;Merseburg Incantations&quot; (see below). &quot;Dís&quot; also had the meaning &quot;lady&quot; in Old Norse poetry, as in the case of Freyja, whose name means &quot;lady&quot; (&quot;frawjō&quot;) and who is called &quot;Vanadís&quot; (&quot;lady of the vanir&quot;).

Adding to the ambiguous meaning of &quot;dís&quot; is the fact that just as supernatural women were called &quot;dísir&quot; in the sense &quot;ladies&quot;, mortal women were frequently called by names for supernatural women, as noted by Snorri Sturluson in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;:

The name &quot;dís&quot; appears in several place names in Norway and Sweden. Moreover, it was a common element in the names of girls, as evidenced on runestones, and it still is in Iceland.

The word appears as a first element in Old High German female given names such as Itispuruc and Itislant. More frequent are Old Norse given names such as Thórdís, Hjördís, Ásdís, Vigdís, Halldís, Freydís.

==Old Norse sources==
In a couple of Eddic and skaldic poems, and in various kennings the generic &quot;dísir&quot; appears instead of the more specific labels &quot;norns&quot;, &quot;fylgjas&quot;, and &quot;valkyries&quot;.

The eddic poem &quot;Hamðismál&quot; deals with how Hamðir and Sörli go to the Gothic king Ermanaric to exact vengeance for the cruel death of their half-sister Svanhild. On the way, they kill their reluctant brother Erpr. Later, knowing that he is about to die at the hands of the Goths, Sörli talks of the cruelty of the dísir who incited him to kill Erpr, because he would have cut off the head of Ermanaric and made their expedition successful. In this poem, &quot;dísir&quot; appears as a synonym of norns and the translator Henry Adams Bellows simply translates &quot;dísir&quot; as &quot;norns&quot;:

In &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, the wise Grímnir (Odin) predicts king Geirröðr&#x27;s death, which he attributes to the wrath of the dísir. Again, &quot;dísir&quot; is used as a synonym for the norns:

In &quot;Reginsmál&quot;, the unmarried Lyngheiðr is called &quot;dís ulfhuguð&quot; (dís/lady with the soul of a wolf) as an insult. Later in the same poem, there is a stanza, where the dísir appear as female spirits accompanying a warrior in order to see him dead in battle, a role where they are synonymous with valkyries:

An additional instance where dís is synonymous with valkyrie is the skaldic poem &quot;Krákumál&quot; – composed by Ragnarr Loðbrók while awaiting his death in a snake pit. It features the line: &quot;Heim bjóða mér dísir&quot; (the dísir invite me home), as one of several poetic circumscriptions for what awaits him.

One source seems to describe the Dísir as the ghosts or spirits of dead women. In &quot;Atlamál&quot;, believed to have been written in Greenland in the twelfth century, the character &quot;Glaumvör&quot; warns her husband Gunnar that she had a dream about the Dísir. Some of the surrounding text has been lost and it is not known what Gunnar may have said prior to this, and there is disagreement on which stanza number this should be given. A possible translation of the material is given as follows by John Lindow in his 2001 book &quot;Norse Mythology&quot;:

<text>Cypripedium is a genus of 58 species and nothospecies of hardy orchids; it is one of five genera that together compose the subfamily of lady&#x27;s slipper orchids (Cypripedioideae). They are widespread across much of the Northern Hemisphere, including most of Europe and Africa (Algeria) (one species), Russia, China, Central Asia, Canada the United States, Mexico, and Central America. They are most commonly known as slipper orchids, lady&#x27;s slipper orchids, or ladyslippers; other common names include moccasin flower, camel&#x27;s foot, squirrel foot, steeple cap, Venus&#x27; shoes, and whippoorwill shoe. An abbreviation used in trade journals is &quot;Cyp.&quot; The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek (), an early reference in Greek myth to Aphrodite, and (), meaning &quot;sandal&quot;.

Most of &quot;Cypripedium&quot; grow in temperate and subtropical climates, but some species grow in the tundra in Alaska and Siberia, which is an unusually cold habitat for orchids. Other species occur well into tropical areas such as Honduras and Myanmar.

Some of the northern species can withstand extreme cold, growing under the snow and blooming when the snow melts. But, in the wild, some have become rare and close to extinction, due to an ever shrinking natural habitat and over-collection, people prizing the flowers for their beauty. Several species are legally protected in some regions. In the late 20th century, only a single known plant of &quot;Cypripedium calceolus&quot; survived in Britain.

== Characteristics ==
The &quot;Cypripedium&quot; are terrestrial and, as with most terrestrial orchids, the rhizome is short and robust, growing in the uppermost soil layer. The rhizome grows annually with a growth bud at one end and dies off at the other end. The stem grows from the bud at the tip of the rhizome. Most slipper orchids have an elongate erect stem, with leaves growing along its length. But the mocassin flower or pink lady&#x27;s slipper (&quot;Cypripedium acaule&quot;) has a short underground stem with leaves springing from the soil. The often hairy leaves can vary from ovate to elliptic or lanceolate, folded (plicate) along their length. The stems lack pseudobulbs.

The inflorescence is racemose. It can carry one to twelve flowers, as in &quot;Cypripedium californicum&quot;. But most species have one to three flowers. There are three sepals, with, in most species, the two lateral ones more or less fused. The flower has three acute petals with the third a striking slipper-shaped lip, which is lowermost. The sepals and the petals are usually similarly colored, with the lip in a different color. But variations on this theme occur. The aspect of the lip of different species can vary a great deal. As with all orchids, it is specially constructed to attract pollinators, which it traps temporarily. The flowers show a column with a unique shield-like staminode. The ovary is 3-locular (with three chambers).

== Taxonomy ==
Comparison between a DNA-analysis and the morphological characteristics in this genus has shown that there is a high degree of divergence between the two, probably due to long periods of isolation or extinction of intermediate forms. The Eurasian species with yellow or red flowers form a distinct group from the North American species with yellow flowers. The Mexican Pelican Orchid (&quot;Cypripedium irapeanum&quot;) and the California lady&#x27;s slipper (&quot;Cypripedium californicum&quot;) are probably the first diverging line. They share several similarities with their sister group &quot;Selenipedium&quot;.

=== Species and natural hybrids ===
There are 58 currently recognized species and nothospecies (naturally occurring hybrids) recognized in this genus, as of May 2014:

===Subgenus Cypripedium===
===Subgenus Irapeana===
==Natural Hybrids==
==Uses==
The genus has a long history of use, dating back 2,500 years to the Far East, where they were used medicinally.

==Conservation==
Several orchid species thought to be extinct in the United Kingdom including one native species in this genus have been found in habitat and are currently the subject of aggressive conservation efforts to protect and restore these showy plants to their native ranges.

<doc id="274779" wikidata="Q37608" url="?curid=274779" title="Bernese Mountain Dog">
<text>The Bernese Mountain Dog, or , is a large dog breed originating from the canton of Bern, Switzerland and the Swiss Alps. It is one of four Sennenhund-type breeds, with ancestral roots in Roman mastiffs. The name &quot;Berner&quot; (or &quot;Bernese&quot; in English) refers to the breed&#x27;s area of origin in the canton of Bern, and &quot;Sennenhund&quot; is derived from the German &quot;Senne&quot; (&quot;alpine pasture&quot;) and &quot;Hund&quot; (&quot;hound/dog&quot;), as they accompanied the alpine herders and dairymen called &quot;Senne&quot; (&quot;m pl&quot;; &quot;Senn, m sg&quot;). This breed was originally kept as a general farm dog and large &quot;Sennenhunde&quot; in the past were also used as draft animals pulling carts. The breed was officially established in 1912.

== History ==
Historically, in some locales at least, the breed was called a &quot;Dürrbachhund&quot; or &quot;Dürrbächler&quot;, for a small town (Dürrbach) where the large dogs were especially frequent.

The dogs have roots in the Roman mastiffs.

The breed was used as an all-purpose farm dog for guarding property and to drive dairy cattle long distances from the farm to the alpine pastures. The farmers used the dogs to transport their carts of milk and cheese and were known by the locals as &quot;Cheese Dogs.&quot; In the early 1900s, fanciers exhibited the few examples of the large dogs at shows in Bern, and in 1907 a few breeders from the Burgdorf region founded the first breed club, the &quot;Schweizerischer Dürrbach-Klub&quot;, and wrote the first Standard which defined the dogs as a separate breed. By 1910, there were already 107 registered members of the breed. There is a photo of a working Bernese Mountain Dog, dated 1905 at the Fumee Fall rest area in Quinnesec, Michigan.

In 1937, the American Kennel Club recognised the breed. Today, the club classifies it as a member of the Working Group. In the US the Bernese Mountain Dog is growing in popularity, ranking in 21st place by the American Kennel Club in 2023.

These dogs are very popular as family dogs in German-speaking countries. The German Association of Dog Breeders listed the Bernese at the 11th rank per live births in 2014.

== Appearance ==

=== Colouring ===
Like the other Sennenhunde, the Bernese mountain dog is a large, heavy dog with a distinctive tri-coloured coat, black with white chest and rust-coloured markings above eyes, sides of the mouth, front of legs, and out around the white chest. However, it is the only breed of Sennenhund dogs with a long coat. The ideal of a perfectly marked individual gives the impression of a white horseshoe shape around the nose, which is always black. There is a white &quot;Swiss cross&quot; on the chest when viewed from the front. A &quot;Swiss kiss&quot; is a white mark located typically behind the neck, but may be a part of the neck. A full ring would not meet the type standard. The AKC breed standard lists, as disqualifications, blue eye colour and any ground colour other than black.

=== Height and weight ranges ===
Dogs stand some at the withers, bitches some ; ideal heights according to the international breed standard are in the ranges and respectively. Weights are approximately in the range for dogs and for bitches.

=== Physical traits ===
Considered a dry-mouthed breed, the Bernese mountain dog is slightly longer than it is tall, highly muscular, with a strong, wide back. The head of a Bernese mountain dog is flat on the top with a moderate stop, and the ears are medium-sized, triangular, set high, and rounded at the top. The teeth have a scissors bite. The legs of the Bernese are straight and strong, with round, arched toes. The dewclaws of the Bernese are often removed. Its bushy tail is carried low.

==Temperament==
The breed standard for the Bernese mountain dog states that dogs should not be &quot;aggressive, anxious or distinctly shy&quot;, but rather should be &quot;good-natured&quot;, &quot;self-assured&quot;, and &quot;docile&quot;. They may be aloof with strangers, and often attach themselves to one favourite person. The temperament of individual dogs may vary, as with all breeds.

Bernese can be calm inside the house and need activity and exercise, but do not have a great deal of endurance. They can move with amazing bursts of speed for their size when motivated. If they are sound (no problems with their hips, elbows, or other joints), they enjoy hiking and generally stick close to their people.

Bernese mountain dogs are a breed that generally does well with children, as they are very affectionate. They are patient dogs that take well to children climbing over them. Though they have great energy, a Bernese will also be happy with a calm evening.

Bernese work well with other pets and around strangers. They are excellent guardians. They tend to bond with one owner or family, and are somewhat aloof and standoffish towards strangers.

==Health==
===Medical problems===
Bernese Mountain Dogs have a high frequency of neoplasia. One study found 55% of deaths to be attributable to cancer. The breed has a high prevalence of elbow dysplasia, with studies ranging from a prevalence of 13.91% to 26%. An allele of the SOD1 gene: SOD1:c.52T has only been found in the Bernese Mountain Dog with 3.5% of Bernese Mountain Dogs having this allele. This mutation is associated with canine degenerative myelopathy. Another mutation associated with the condition — although not exclusive to the breed — has a prevalence of 38% in the Bernese Mountain Dog. The Bernese Mountain Dog has an increased prevalence of immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. A Swiss study found both the incidence and mortality of renal disease to be higher in this breed than any other — the incidence was 3.2 times higher than the average and the mortality was 8.2 times the average. The breed has a high risk of developing high-grade mastocytoma, with an Austrian study finding Bernese Mountain Dogs being three times as likely to have the condition than the general population.

Histiocytosis is a rare group of disorders that involve a build up of histiocytes in tissue and organs, causing damage to the tissue or organ. It may be benign or malignant. Malignant histiocytosis is a rapidly progressive multisystem cancerous disease that affects the Bernese Mountain Dog. It&#x27;s a familial disease with a heritability value of 0.298 and accounts for a quarter of all tumours in the breed. Other histiocytosis conditions such as systemic histiocytosis and cutaneous histiocytosis are also more prevalent in the breed. Mutations have been identified that are believed to play a role in this are mutations to genes that help suppress tumours, including: CDKN2A/B, PTEN, and RB1. Another related mutation is to the PTPN11 gene, which is known to be related to histiocytosis and cancer in humans.

The Bernese Mountain Dog is one of the more commonly affected breeds for type I von Willebrand&#x27;s disease.

===Life expectancy===
Despite the fact that larger breeds have a lower life expectancy than smaller breeds the life expectancy of the Bernese Mountain Dog is still low even when compared to breeds of similar size. 
*In a 2016 Swiss study the life expectancy was found to be 8.4 years, based on the deaths of 381 out of 389 dogs in the study. 
*A 2013 Dutch study found a life expectancy of 8 years. 
*A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 10.1 years compared to 12 years for crossbreeds and 12.7 years for purebreds. 
*A 2013 French study found a life expectancy of 8.1 years.
*A Swedish study from 2005 found 72% of Bernese Mountain Dogs to have died before reaching 10 years of age.

== Care ==
===Activities===

The Bernese&#x27;s calm temperament makes them a natural for pulling small carts or wagons, a task they originally performed in Switzerland. With proper training they enjoy giving children rides in a cart or participating in a parade, such as the Conway, New Hampshire holiday parade. Regional Bernese clubs often offer carting workshops. Carting competitions are held for the breed.

On July 1, 2010, the Bernese Mountain Dog became eligible to compete in AKC Herding Events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Berners exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

The breed is &quot;energetic, attentive, impetuous,&quot; but indisposed to biting. They tend to attach to one person, and have an inherent suspicion of strangers. And Switzerland they excel at herd guardianship, especially in the Holy Regions. They are untiring, often unruly, resistant to the coldest winters, and excellent defenders of stable or home. They have been used by the police in Switzerland.

== Notable dogs ==

* Hercules is Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger&#x27;s dog that he brought home from the Emmental region of Switzerland during a 2006 weeklong trip to discover his family&#x27;s roots in the country.
*Smelly and Harvey Milkbone are two Bernese Mountain Dogs owned by the characters Bryan (Andrew Rannells) and David (Justin Bartha) in the 2012 TV series &quot;The New Normal&quot;.
* Buttercup is a Bernese Mountain Dog on the television series &quot;9-1-1: Lone Star&quot;.
* Ohly was a Bernese Mountain Dog in Canada who became known after disappearing and then being found on Mount Seymour in a dangerous area known as &quot;Suicide Gulley.&quot; Members of North Shore Rescue, a local mountain rescue team, tracked, located and rescued Ohly. 
* Quincey von Wiesmadern, has appeared in various videos with Hansi Hinterseer, an Austrian singer, entertainer and former member of the Austrian Ski Team.
* Hannah is the real-life inspiration for the protagonist of children&#x27;s books such as &quot;A Beach Day for Hannah&quot; and &quot;A Snow Day for Hannah&quot; by Linda Petrie Bunch.
* Argus and Fiona were two Bernese mountain dogs that were shot and killed when they entered a neighbour&#x27;s yard. The neighbour who shot the dogs admits that he was overreacting. A Pennsylvania state law states that humans are free to kill animals attacking domestic animals. The man feared a possible attack on his sheep, who were in their fenced off grazing area. Attacks on a neighbour&#x27;s farm had taken place and resulted in the death of several animals sometime the previous year, although the type of dog who attacked those animals was not a Bernese. However, since no attack was in progress at the time of the shooting, the shooter was charged with two counts of cruelty to animals and one count of recklessly endangering another person, the latter a result of there being a house within the possible line of fire. There were no residents at home at the time of the shooting. The prosecuting attorney dithered about bringing charges. On September 11, 2013, the shooter was convicted on two counts of animal cruelty. He faces up to five years in jail for each count.
* Izzy survived the destruction of her family&#x27;s Northern California home in the October 2017 Northern California wildfires and emerged from the woods with her tail wagging as her family investigated the ruins. Family members captured the reunion on video.
* Bród and Síoda, two pet dogs of the President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins. Síoda died on September 19, 2020. In March 2021, a new puppy named Misneach was first photographed with President Higgins. Bród died on April 22, 2023.
* Stella is a Bernese mountain dog in Plymouth, Michigan who has two restaurants named after her, &quot;Stella&#x27;s Black Dog Tavern,&quot; and &quot;Stella&#x27;s Trackside.&quot; She also has a book written about her titled &quot;Introducing Stella&quot;.

== Rescues ==
* Nico (2015), an adopted Bernese mountain dog, became a hero when he saved two people who were being swept out into the ocean by a California rip current.
* Bella saved owner Chris Larocque from a burning house by pulling him out. The owner had reduced mobility from the injuries inflicted, and said that he would have died without Bella&#x27;s help.
* Oakley (2014) saved her family, by sitting on her owner&#x27;s head until he woke up, when their Vermont ski condo caught fire overnight.
* Ben, a Bernese Mountain Dog/Border Collie mix, saved his family from a fire that started after they were asleep. He alerted the babysitter who was able to get the two kids and Ben out to safety.

<text>The Studenica Monastery (, ) is a 12th-century Serbian Orthodox monastery situated southwest of Kraljevo and east of Ivanjica, in central Serbia. It is one of the largest and richest Serb Orthodox monasteries.

Stefan Nemanja, the founder of the medieval Serb state, founded the monastery in 1190. The monastery&#x27;s fortified walls encompass two churches: the Church of the Virgin, and the Church of the King, both of which were built using white marble. The monastery is best known for its collection of 13th- and 14th century Byzantine-style fresco paintings.

Studenica was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia, and in 1986 UNESCO included Studenica monastery on the list of World Heritage Sites, with the description:

==History==

The monastery &quot;Studenica&quot;, dedicated to the Presentation of the Holy Virgin, is the mother-church of all Serbian temples. It was constructed over a quite long period of time. The first stage of works were completed by the spring of 1196, when Stefan Nemanja abdicated and took monastic vows at the monastery. When he later left for Hilandar, his son and successor Stefan took over the care of Studenica. Nemanja died in Hilandar in 1199. Nemanja&#x27;s third son Rastko (&quot;Saint Sava&quot;), after reconciling with his brothers Stefan and Vukan, moved Nemanja&#x27;s relics to Studenica. Under guardianship of Sava, Studenica became the political, cultural and spiritual center of medieval Serbia.

Studenica enjoyed continual care by the members of the Nemanjić dynasty. King Radoslav added a splendid narthex to the church in 1235. King Milutin built a small but lovely church dedicated to saints Joachim and Anna.

Since the fall of the last of the medieval Serbian states in 1459, the Turks often assaulted the monastery. The first of the significant restorations of the damage took place in 1569, when the frescoes in the Church of the Virgin were repainted. In the early 17th century, an earthquake and a fire befell the monastery, and historical documents and a significant part of the artistic heritage were destroyed and lost forever.

==Architecture==

The Virgin&#x27;s Church is a domed single-nave basilica. At its eastern end there is a three-sided apse, while an extended narthex faces west; there are also vestibules on the north and the south. In the 1230s, a large exonarthex was added. The facades were built with slabs of white marble; inside, the church is revetted with tuff blocks. Externally, the Church harmoniously reconciles two architectural styles, the Romanesque and the Byzantine. The blending of these two styles eventually produced a particular style of architecture known as the Raška School.

Northwest of the Church of the Virgin there is the church of saints Joachim and Anna, known after its founder King Milutin as the King&#x27;s Church. The church was constructed in 1314, in the form of a compressed cross, with the exterior structure of an octagonal dome. It is built of stone and tuff, with plastered facades.

The complex of the Studenica monastery includes the Church of St. Nicholas, a small single-nave church frescoed inside with works from the 12th or possibly early 13th centuries. Between the Church of St. Nicholas and the King&#x27;s Church are the foundations of the church dedicated to St. John the Baptist. West of the Virgin&#x27;s Church, there is an old refectory made of rubble, built during the time of Archbishop Sava. Finally, on the western side of the monastery complex there is a bell tower, erected in the 13th century. There used to be a chapel inside; now, only fragments of frescoes can be seen there. Remains of fresco painting have also been numbered on the external part of the narthex, splendidly representing the Nemanjić dynasty genealogy. They obviously relate to the frescoes from the Virgin&#x27;s Church which date back to 1208-1209.

Northward from the Studenica refectory is the 18th century monastic residence, which now houses a museum and displays a number of the precious exhibits from the Studenica treasury. However, the frequent wars and plunders have considerably reduced the depository of the Studenica treasury.

==Art==

The artistic achievements of the sculpture of Studenica culminate in four portals of the Virgin&#x27;s Church, primarily the west one, inside between the narthex and the exonarthex. On the north wall under the dome, there is a window made of many square panes with medallions carved on a leaden plaque which represent eight fantastic animals - the symbols of the Virgin&#x27;s virtues. There are also two rosettes denoting the Divine Eye. The masons came to Studenica most probably from the Adriatic region, perhaps from Kotor, where Nemanja used to have a palace. They left an inscription in Serbian lettering on the tympanum of the west portal.

The Virgin&#x27;s Church was painted in the first decade of the 13th century. The original frescoes have been partly preserved in the altar area, under the dome, on the west wall, and in the lower registers of the nave. The most splendid representation is that of the Crucifixion, painted on blue background in 1209, one of the paramount achievements in Serbian art. On the south wall there is the &quot;founders&#x27; composition&quot; which shows the Virgin taking Nemanja (Simon) with the church model to Jesus Christ as the Magistrate Impartial. The narthex was painted in 1569. Those frescoes include an exquisite representation of the Last Judgment in the upper registers and the portrait of Nemanja&#x27;s wife Ana as the nun Anastasia.

The earliest fresco painting in King&#x27;s church marks the supreme achievement of Byzantine art in the region. The frescoes in Radoslav&#x27;s narthex and the parecclesions originate from the 1230s and display a close relation to the painting style of the main church. The north chapel, dedicated to St. Nicholas, contains a composition of the Hetoimasia and a cycle dealing with the life of St. Nicholas. In the south chapel, one finds the portraits of Nemanja, Stefan the First Crowned and King Radoslav with his wife Ana. On the north wall of the narthex, three dignitaries of the Serbian Church are portrayed - the archbishops Sava, Arsenije and Sava II (Radoslav&#x27;s brother).

<text>Mallt-y-Nos (&quot;Matilda of the Night&quot;), also known as the Night Mallt, is a crone in Welsh mythology who rides with Arawn and the hounds (Cŵn Annwn) of the Wild Hunt, chasing sorrowful, lost souls to Annwn. The Mallt-y-Nos drives the hounds onward with shrieks and wails, which some say are evil and malicious in nature.

Others say that she was once a beautiful but impious noblewoman who loved hunting so much that she said, &quot;If there is no hunting in heaven, I would rather not go!&quot; She is said to have regretted making this wish, and now cries out in misery rather than joy as she hunts forever in the night sky.

<text>Milton Delugg (December 2, 1918 – April 6, 2015) was an American musician, composer and arranger.

==Early years==
Milton Delugg was born in Los Angeles, California. He said, &quot;There aren&#x27;t any Deluggs. It&#x27;s not a real name.&quot; He believed the family&#x27;s ancestral name to be D&#x27;Luggatch. Delugg&#x27;s great grandfather said no one could pronounce it so he changed it to &quot;Delugg&quot;, with a lower case &quot;L&quot;.

Delugg attended the University of California, Los Angeles. His initial musical training was on a piano. Moving to the accordion came as the result of a gift. &quot;When my dad gave me an accordion I learned how to play jazz on it&quot;, he said. &quot;I grew up in Los Angeles and it wasn&#x27;t long before I had a monopoly on any calls for jazz accordionists.&quot;

==Military service==
Delugg served in the Radio Production Unit of the US Army Air Force during World War II. During that time he was a member of (and sometimes soloist with) the 36-piece orchestra of the West Coast Army Air Force Training Center.

==Post-war career==
A talented accordionist, Delugg appeared in short soundies musicals and occasional movies (like 1949&#x27;s &quot;Jolson Sings Again&quot;). He quickly became a successful arranger and composer and worked as bandleader at Slapsie Maxie&#x27;s Wilshire location in Hollywood. His clients ranged from the American Junior Miss Pageant to soul singer and performer Jackie Wilson, and he was a musician on such radio programs as &quot;School Days of the Air&quot;, and &quot;The Abe Burrows Show&quot;. One of his best-known tunes is an arrangement of the song &quot;The Happy Wanderer&quot;, and his brassy polka &quot;Hoop Dee Doo&quot; became a game show staple.

In 1950 and 1951, Delugg was musical director, bandleader, and accordionist on &quot;Broadway Open House&quot; the NBC late-night television program considered to be the forerunner to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. He often played a song he co-wrote, &quot;Orange Colored Sky&quot;, which was best remembered as a hit for Nat King Cole. In 1950, Delugg was also orchestra conductor for the short-lived &quot;Abe Burrows&#x27; Almanac&quot;.

In 1953, the Milton Delugg Trio appeared on the short-lived &quot;The Bill Cullen Show&quot;. Four years later, in 1957, Delugg joined the cast of the &quot;Winchell and Mahoney Show&quot;.

He composed the tune &quot;Roller Coaster&quot; – recorded by Henri Rene Orchestra on RCA Victor. It was used as the closing theme for the popular Goodson-Todman Productions panel show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; from the early 1950s until its cancellation in 1967.

Based in New York City, Delugg was also active in the recording industry. In 1958 he produced the Buddy Holly single &quot;Rave On!&quot;.

==Television projects==
Delugg served as NBC&#x27;s musical director for several decades. In 1966, he briefly served as the musical director of The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson after the departure of Skitch Henderson. He was later replaced by Doc Severinsen in 1968.

Delugg enjoyed a long association with Chuck Barris, beginning as arranger of the original theme to &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; in 1966. From 1976 to 1980, he was musical director of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; (appearing with his &quot;Band With a Thug&quot;). Delugg often appeared on the show in comedy skits, including the characters of bad joke teller &quot;Naso Literatus&quot; and philosopher &quot;Old Drool&quot;. Delugg&#x27;s venerable &quot;Hoop Dee Doo&quot; became a fixture on &quot;The Gong Show&quot; and was played when the daily winner was chosen.

Delugg also wrote the theme music for other Barris projects including &quot;The $1.98 Beauty Show&quot;, &quot;Camouflage&quot; (where, in a throwback to an earlier era of game shows, the music was actually performed live by Delugg and his band), &quot;Leave It to the Women&quot;, &quot;3&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, and &quot;The New Treasure Hunt&quot;. He also recorded new versions of the theme songs to the 1970s versions of &quot;The Dating Game&quot; and &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, as well as providing the themes for their 1980s revivals. Delugg and sidemen Mark Stevens, Billy Neale, and Ray Neapolitan appeared in Barris&#x27;s &quot;The Gong Show Movie&quot; (1980) as The Hollywood Cowboys.

Delugg remained active as musical director of the annual Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade through 2013, and made one final, on-camera appearance during the 2014 parade.

==Film soundtracks==
Delugg and his wife Anne composed film scores and songs for the mid-1960s American releases of German and Japanese children&#x27;s films such as &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels Beyond the Moon&quot;, &quot;Der gestiefelte Kater (Puss in Boots)&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, and &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.&quot;

Delugg composed the score for &quot;Santa Claus Conquers the Martians&quot; and the song &quot;Hooray for Santa Claus&quot;.

==Song credits==
Delugg composed a number of popular songs that became hits for a variety of artists, including &quot;Orange Colored Sky&quot; (Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, 1950); &quot;Shanghai&quot; (Doris Day, (1951); &quot;Be My Life&#x27;s Companion&quot; (The Mills Brothers, 1951); &quot;Shake Hands With Santa Claus&quot; (Louis Prima, 1951); &quot;The Photograph On The Piano&quot; (Georgia Gibbs, 1952); &quot;Just Another Polka&quot; (Eddie Fisher, 1953); and &quot;A Poor Man&#x27;s Roses (Or a Rich Man&#x27;s Gold)&quot; (Patsy Cline, 1956).

==Personal life==
Delugg and his wife, Anne, were married from 1946 until she died in 2002. They had three children. Their daughter died in 8th grade.

Delugg died of heart failure at his home in Los Angeles, California, on April 6, 2015, at the age of 96.

<doc id="274784" wikidata="Q782217" url="?curid=274784" title="Tourism in Australia">
<text>Tourism in Australia is an important part of the Australian economy, and comprises domestic and international visitors. Australia is the fortieth most visited country in the world according to the World Tourism Organization. In the financial year 2018/19, tourism was Australia&#x27;s fourth-largest export and over the previous decade was growing faster than national GDP growth. At the time it represented 3.1% of Australia&#x27;s GDP contributing A$60.8 billion to the national economy.

In the calendar year up to December 2019, there were 8.7 million international visitors in Australia. Tourism employed 666,000 people in Australia in 2018–19, 1 in 21 jobs across the workforce. About 48% of people employed in tourism were full-time and 54% female. Tourism also contributed 8.2% of Australia&#x27;s total export earnings in 2018–19. 

Popular Australian destinations mainly include the coastal capital cities of Sydney and Melbourne, as well as other high-profile destinations including the other coastal cities of Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Gold Coast, and the Great Barrier Reef, the world&#x27;s largest reef. Other popular locations include Uluru, the Australian outback, and the Tasmanian wilderness. The unique Australian wildlife is also another significant point of interest in the country&#x27;s tourism.

==Trends==
Despite the global economic challenges and natural disasters in 2010–2011, Australia&#x27;s tourism growth was supported by increased consumption (up 4.4% over the last few years, largely due to an increase in the number of international visitors). On the back of a strong Australian dollar, 2010–11 also saw a record 7.4 million short-term resident departures from Australia, an increase of 9.9% from 2009–10. Consumption by domestic tourists grew at less than half the pace of international tourists in 2010–11 (up 2.1% compared to 4.4%).

The Australian Government released the 2020 Tourism Industry Potential on 15 November 2010, which estimated the Australian tourism industry to be worth up to $140 billion in overnight expenditure. This growth will largely be due to key emerging markets, including China, which is estimated to be the largest economic contributor to Australian tourism by 2020. The number of Chinese visitors has more than doubled from 2006 to 2012 reaching a peak of 626,400 in 2012 and surpassing for the first time the number of arrivals from the United Kingdom. In 2013, China was Australia&#x27;s fastest growing tourist market. By 2017 China surpassed New Zealand as the top source of visitors to Australia, and in 2019 Chinese visitors reached a peak of over 1.4 million and had contributed about A$12 billion to the Australian economy. According to Tourism Australia Managing Director Andrew McEvoy, the Chinese are the highest spending visitors to the country.
==Visas==

All visitors to Australia, apart from New Zealanders, require an Australian visa to enter the country. For most countries, a full visa is required. Passport holders of all European Union countries as well as all Schengen Area countries and European microstates can apply online for an eVisitor authorisation. Citizens of some OECD and some East Asian countries can apply for the similar Electronic Travel Authority authorisation.

==History==

From the colonial days, the idea of travel has been more natural to Australians than to people long-established at one from their homes, was prone to continue their search for wealth or security for a while, or, having settled down, to return to the old countries to visit their kin and refresh old memories. The opening of new lands, the establishment of industries and towns, and the consequent dispersal of people over Australia created a habit of mobility and enterprise which encouraged Australians to face the hardships of early travel by coach, on horseback or by ship. Even so, the slow and uncomfortable modes of travel and the vast distances separating Australian towns tended to restrict travel to essential journeys for purposes of trade, to pursue an occupation or to settle. This changed somewhat with the advent of rail travel.

The initial emphasis in tourism for purposes of pleasure was strongest on travel to resorts near the main population centres. These included the Blue Mountains in New South Wales and the hill and coast resorts close to Melbourne and other major Victorian cities. The existing railway services radiating from those cities, together with the &#x27;feeder&#x27; horse-drawn, and later motor, coach transport connecting with the railways, rendered the State Government railway tourist bureaux the main means for selling intrastate, and even some interstate, travel.

Travel for all purposes increased steadily after the Second World War. This period saw the establishment of the Australian National Travel Association with bureaux in the UK and USA. The organisation received government funding on top of industry contributions and promoted the country &#x27;vigorously&#x27; via a poster campaign, and from 1934–1974 via Walkabout magazine. From August 1946, &quot;Walkabout&quot; also doubled as the official journal of the newly formed Australian Geographical Society (AGS), founded with a £5,000 grant from ANTA, its banner subscript reading &#x27;Journal of the Australian Geographical Society. This role is now filled by &quot;Australian Geographic&quot; magazine. Later it became ‘Australia&#x27;s Way of Life Magazine’ when supported by the Australian National Publicity Association and later the Australian Tourist Commission.

Tourism traffic continued to be mainly by rail, but also by sea, although the family motor era began in the 1930s to participate in the shorter intrastate traffic. A considerable fleet of passenger ships provided frequent and popular services linking most ports between Fremantle and Cairns. Other services linked Sydney and Melbourne with Tasmanian ports. The winter cruise of those days to Queensland ports could be regarded as the equivalent of today&#x27;s drive or flight north for a winter holiday at the Gold Coast or a Barrier Reef Island, or today&#x27;s shorter South Pacific cruises. The first cruises from Australia to New Zealand were organised in the summer of 1934–35, and Australians were travelling to Britain for as low as $78 in tourist class in the years immediately preceding the Second World War.

In the period following the Second World War the advent of new and improved methods of transportation, combined with rising standards of living and the energetic publicising of foreign destinations, developed international travel into a mass movement. New ocean liners shortened travelling time considerably, and travel by car and bus increased in many countries. Most of all, air travel became widely available, faster, safer, and cheaper. The beginning of the Jet Age in 1960, with larger aeroplanes carrying more than 100 passengers at speeds approximating 600 miles per hour, diminished the world by half in terms of time. Rising standards of living in the post-war period led to greater expenditure on tourism, thus making it more important to the national economy.

Australia has shared in this worldwide expansion of travel, particularly in respect of its domestic tourism. Because of the marked increase in incomes and private car ownership among large sections of the population, greater leisure time, three weeks of paid annual holidays (introduced first in New South Wales in 1958) and the introduction of long-service leave, thousands of Australians now travel by road into almost every part of the country. This has led to investment in the development of new and improved facilities, especially accommodation, of new resorts at dispersed points around Australia, and modifications in organisation and methods of tourist administration, development and promotion. These activities, in turn, have had an important influence on matters such as the improvement of highways and the opening up of national parks and foreshores.

A White Paper was produced analysing the tourist industry in Australia in 2003. A Tourism 2020 strategy was produced and implemented.

Prior to COVID-19 pandemic and Deltacron hybrid variant, domestic tourism in Australia continues to be a significant part of the tourism industry, representing 73% of the total direct tourism GDP and has taken on an even greater role. However, in 2021 during the pandemic, Australians travelled intrastate and also interstate when borders were open. From November 2021, borders for Australia were opened and fully vaccinated Australians were permitted to fly overseas without exemption, although the range of countries was added to Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand, and other countries including Japan in December allowed to enter the country, from 1 December 2021.
Following the significant consultation on the replacement Tourism 2030 strategy, its launch was interrupted by COVID-19 leading to the Government Commissioning an Expert Panel led by the former Tourism Minister Martin Ferguson to provide recommendations.

Eventually, an updated Tourism 2030 document titled THRIVE (THe Re-Imagined Visitor Economy) 2030 strategy was finalised and published in March 2022. The document was updated to reflect the new Government&#x27;s initiatives and policy priorities as well as industry actions and State and Territory support statements and launched on 17 March 2023.

===Organizations===
The Australian Trade and Investment Commission has tourism policy and programs responsibility in the Australian Government with Tourism Australia responsible for marketing Australia. State and territory government jurisdictions have tourism policy departments and/or tourism marketing authorities along with regional tourism organisations. The industry has a wide range of stakeholder bodies including the &quot;Australian Tourism Industry Council&quot; (ATIC), which includes promotion of the &quot;Quality Tourism Framework&quot;, the &quot;Australian Tourism Awards&quot; and &quot;Star Ratings Australia&quot;; the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Tourism Chamber, and the &quot;Australian Tourism Export Council&quot; (ATEC).

==Marketing==


Australia&#x27;s international tourism campaigns have focused on Australia&#x27;s laid back style, such as the 1980s advertising campaign featuring actor Paul Hogan telling American tourists &quot;I&#x27;ll slip an extra shrimp on the barbie for you&quot;, or its cheeky side, as in its controversial 2006 campaign in the United Kingdom using the Australian colloquialism slogan &quot;So where the bloody hell are you?&quot;.

Tourism Australia&#x27;s &quot;No Leave No Life&quot; campaign was launched in March 2009 by the Federal Minister for Tourism, the Hon. Martin Ferguson AM MP. This campaign was designed to remind employees of the personal and professional benefits of taking annual leave, and of taking that leave in Australia. On 30 June 2009, there were 126 million days of stockpiled annual leave in the Australian economy. At the end of the June 2010 quarter, this number had decreased to 117 million days, following falls in the preceding three quarters.

Tourism Australia&#x27;s consumer campaign &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing Like Australia&quot; invited Australians to share their favourite Australian place or experience with the world. The campaign is based on research conducted by Tourism Australia that showed Australians were eager to get involved in promoting their country. It was developed to involve Australians because they are the experts on what makes Australia unlike anywhere else. The core message, that &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing Like Australia&quot; was designed for longevity through different mediums, audiences and activities.

==Types of tourists==

===Tourists by country ===

===International tourists===

In 2019, the majority of international visitors to Australia were from China, New Zealand, the United States and the UK, with visitors from China growing substantially from the early 2000s. 

Growth in tourism in 2019 was led by education and holiday travel. Education visitors were up 5% to 586,000, with spending increasing by 8% to a record $12.7 billion. Holiday visitors were up 4% to almost 4 million, with spending growing by 6% to $16.9 billion.

===Backpackers===
Australia is popular for people engaging in backpacker tourism. Spending more time in Australia, these travellers tend to explore considerably more of the country. Many backpackers participate in working holidays enabling them to stay longer in the country. Working holiday visas for Australia are available for those aged 18 to 30 for most citizens from Western Europe, Canada, the United States, and some developed East Asian nations such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. More than 111,000 of these visas were issued between July and December 2022, compared to 23,000 over the same period in 2021. This brings them back in line with pre-pandemic levels. As a result of this, hostel revenue is projected to grow by 7.9% in the 2023–24 financial year.

=== Birdwatchers ===
According to Tourism Research Australia, international visitors spent $2.6 billion on travel that involved birdwatching in 2024. Some visitors travel long distances and spend thousands of dollars chasing a glimpse of rare birds.

===Domestic tourism===
The domestic tourism market is estimated at $63 billion. In 2009, the Australian domestic market experienced a 10% slump in the number of visitor nights. Domestic tourism in general and in particular free caravan and camping sites for overnight accommodation experienced strong demand in 2012.

Australians are big domestic travellers, with a profusion of seaside resort towns in every state (many located on or near good surfing beaches), mountain retreats, plentiful national parks, rivers, fishing locations, wine growing regions, as well as domestic visitation of the major tourist spots. Domestic tourism peaks during the Australian school holidays.

In 2011, a leading Australian travel agent warned that low-cost carriers such as AirAsia and Jetstar who offered cheap packages to Asia threatened the domestic tourism market.
===Markets===
==Attractions==
===Ecotourism===
Australia has a diverse geography, containing many distinct geographical features and unique fauna. Ecotourism accounts for a large portion of Australia&#x27;s domestic and international tourism, with two thirds of all international visitors in 2016 having engaged in nature tourism in some way. Popular activities include skiing, surfing, hiking, camping and whale watching.

Whale watching is available seasonally on almost all of Australia&#x27;s subtropical coast. Boat tours are usually offered in coastal towns, although whales can be easily viewed from the shoreline. Whale watching hubs include Hervey Bay, Eden and Bateman&#x27;s Bay.
=== Arts and cultural tourism ===
Many tourists that visit Australia engage with cultural tourism, including some 54% of international tourists and 26% of domestic tourists in 2015. Cultural tourism is most significant in Australia&#x27;s urban areas, however most towns will offer some sort of heritage tourism. 

==== Events ====
Year-round, Australia has many events, which attract both domestic and international tourists. The Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is an annual event that attractions thousands of international tourists.

The World’s second largest annual Arts festival The Adelaide Fringe (only smaller than The Edinburgh Festival Fringe) welcomed 2.7 million attendees in 2019.

The 2000 Sydney Olympics resulted in significant inbound and domestic tourism to Sydney. During the games, Sydney hosted 362,000 domestic and 110,000 international visitors. In addition, up to 4 billion people watched the games worldwide. The 2003 Rugby World Cup attracted 65,000 international visitors to Australia. Schoolies Week is an annual celebration of Year 12 school leavers in late November, many of whom travel to the Gold Coast, where in 2011 they were expected to boost the economy by $60 million.

<text>The roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), also known as the roe, western roe deer, or European roe, is a species of deer. The male of the species is sometimes referred to as a roebuck. The roe is a small deer, reddish and grey-brown, and well-adapted to cold environments. The species is widespread in Europe, from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia, from Scotland to the Caucasus, and east as far as northern Iran.

==Etymology==
The English &quot;roe&quot; is from the Old English or &#x27;, from Proto-Germanic &quot;*raihô&quot;, cognate with Old Norse &#x27;, Old Saxon &quot;rēho&quot;, Middle Dutch and Dutch &#x27;, Old High German &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, German &quot;&quot;. It is perhaps ultimately derived from a PIE root &quot;*rei-&quot;, meaning &quot;streaked, spotted or striped&quot;.

The word is attested on the 5th-century Caistor-by-Norwich astragalusa roe deer talus bone, written in Elder Futhark as , transliterated as &quot;raïhan&quot;.

In the English language, this deer was originally simply called a &#x27;roe&#x27;, but over time the word &#x27;roe&#x27; has become a qualifier, and it is now usually called &#x27;roe deer&#x27;.

The Koiné Greek name &quot;&quot;, transliterated &#x27;pygargos&#x27;, mentioned in the Septuagint and the works of various writers such as Hesychius, Herodotus and later Pliny, was originally thought to refer to this species (in many European translations of the Bible), although it is now more often believed to refer to the addax. It is derived from the words 
 () and 

The taxonomic name &quot;Capreolus&quot; is derived from &quot;capra&quot; or &quot;caprea&quot;, meaning &#x27;billy goat&#x27;, with the diminutive suffix -&quot;olus&quot;. The meaning of this word in Latin is not entirely clear: it may have meant &#x27;ibex&#x27; or &#x27;chamois&#x27;. The roe was also known as &#x27; or &#x27; in Latin.

==Taxonomy==
Linnaeus first described the roe deer in the modern taxonomic system as &quot;Cervus capreolus&quot; in 1758. The initially monotypic genus &quot;Capreolus&quot; was first proposed by John Edward Gray in 1821, although he did not provide a proper description for this taxon. Gray was not actually the first to use the name &quot;Capreolus&quot;, it has been used by other authors before him. Nonetheless, his publication is seen as taxonomically acceptable. He was generally ignored until the 20th century, most 19th-century works having continued to follow Linnaeus.

Roe deer populations gradually become somewhat larger as one moves further to the east, peaking in Kazakhstan, then becoming smaller again towards the Pacific Ocean. The Soviet mammalogist Vladimir Sokolov had recognised this as a separate species from 1985 already using electrophoretic chromatography to show differences in the fractional protein content of the body tissues. Fawns, females and males make different noises between species. Alexander S. Graphodatsky looked at the karyotypy to present more evidence to recognise these Russian and Asian populations as a separate species, now renamed the eastern or Siberian roe deer (&quot;Capreolus pygargus&quot;).

This new taxonomic interpretation (circumscription) was first followed in the American book &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; in 1993. Populations of the roe deer from east of the Khopyor River and Don River to Korea are considered to be this species.

===Subspecies===

The Integrated Taxonomic Information System, following the 2005 &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot;, gives the following subspecies:
*&quot;Capreolus capreolus capreolus&quot; 
*&quot;Capreolus capreolus canus&quot; - Spain
*&quot;Capreolus capreolus caucasicus&quot; - A large-sized subspecies found in the region to the north of the Caucasus Mountains; although &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; appears to recognise the taxon, this work bases itself on a chapter by Lister &quot;et al&quot;. in the 1998 book &quot;The European roe deer: the biology of success&quot;, which only recognises the name as provisional.
*&quot;Capreolus capreolus italicus&quot; - Italy

This is just one (extreme) interpretation among a number of them. Two main specialists did not recognise these taxa and considered the species to be without subspecies in 2001. The European Union&#x27;s &quot;Fauna Europaea&quot; recognised in 2005 two subspecies, but besides the nominate form recognises the Spanish population as the endemic &quot;Capreolus capreolus garganta&quot; .

===Systematics===
Roe deer are most closely related to the water deer, and, counter-intuitively, the three species in this group, called the Capreolini, are most closely related to moose and reindeer.

Although roe deer were once classified as belonging to the Cervinae subfamily, they are now classified as part of the Capreolinae, which includes the deer that developed in the New World.

===Hybrids===
Both the European roe deer and Siberian roe deer have seen their populations increase, both around the 1930s. In recent times, since the 1960s, the two species have become sympatric where their distributions meet, and there is now a broad &#x27;hybridization zone&#x27; running from the right side of the Volga River up to eastern Poland. It is extremely difficult for hunters to know which species they have bagged. In line with Haldane&#x27;s rule, female hybrids of the two taxa are fertile, while male hybrids are not. Hybrids are much larger than normal and a Cesarean section was sometimes needed to birth the fawns, becoming larger than their mothers at the age of 4–5 months. F1 hybrid males may be sterile, but backcrosses with the females are possible.

22% of the animals around Moscow carry the mtDNA of the European roe deer and 78% of the Siberian. In the Volgograd region, the European roe deer predominates. In the Stavropol and Dnipropetrovsk regions of Ukraine, most of the deer are Siberian roe deer. In northeastern Poland there is also evidence of introgression with the Siberian roe deer, which was likely an Introduced species. In some cases, such as around Moscow, former introductions of European stock is likely responsible.

==Description==

The roe deer is a relatively small deer, with a body length of throughout its range, and a shoulder height of , and a weight of . Populations from Urals and northern Kazakhstan are larger on average growing to in length and at shoulder height, with body weights of up to , with the populations becoming smaller again further east in the Transbaikal, Amur Oblast, and Primorsky Krai regions. In healthy populations, where population density is restricted by hunting or predators, bucks are slightly larger than does. Under other conditions, males can be similar in size to females, or slightly smaller.

Bucks in good conditions develop antlers up to long with two or three, rarely even four, points. When the male&#x27;s antlers begin to regrow, they are covered in a thin layer of velvet-like fur which disappears later on after the hair&#x27;s blood supply is lost. Males may speed up the process by rubbing their antlers on trees, so that their antlers are hard and stiff for the duels during the mating season. Unlike most cervids, roe deer begin regrowing antlers almost immediately after they are shed. In rare cases, some bucks possess only a single antler branch, the result of a genetic defect.

==Distribution==
The roe deer is found in most areas of Europe, with the exception of northernmost Scandinavia, Iceland, Ireland, and the islands of the Mediterranean Sea. In the Mediterranean region, it is largely confined to mountainous areas, and is absent or rare at low altitudes. There is an early Neolithic fossil record from Jordan.

===Belgium===
In Flanders the roe deer was mostly confined to the hilly regions in the east, but like in neighbouring countries the population has expanded in recent times. A theory is that the expansion of maize cultivation, which are higher than traditional crops and afford more shelter, has aided their expansion to the west.

===Britain===
In England and Wales, roe deer have experienced a substantial expansion in their range in the latter half of the 20th century and continuing into the 21st century. This increase in population also appears to be affecting woodland ecosystems. At the start of the 20th century, they were almost extirpated in Southern England, but since then have hugely expanded their range, mostly due to restrictions and decrease in hunting, increases in forests and reductions in arable farming, changes in agriculture (more winter cereal crops), a massive reduction in extensive livestock husbandry, and a general warming climate over the past 200 years. Furthermore, there are no large predators in Britain. In some cases, roe deer have been introduced with human help. In 1884 roe deer were introduced from Württemberg in Germany into the Thetford Forest, and these spread to populate most of Norfolk, Suffolk, and substantial parts of Cambridgeshire. In southern England, they started their expansion in Sussex (possibly from enclosed stock in Petworth Park) and from there soon spread into Surrey, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Dorset, and for the first half of the 20th century, most roe deer in Southern England were to be found in these counties. By the end of the 20th century, they had repopulated much of southern England and had expanded into Somerset, Devon, Cornwall, Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Warwickshire, Lincolnshire and South Yorkshire, and had even spread into Wales from the Ludlow area where an isolated population had appeared. At the same time, the surviving population in Scotland and the Lake District had pushed further south beyond Yorkshire and Lancashire and into Derbyshire and Humberside.

In the 1970s, the species was still completely absent from Wales. Roe deer can now be found in most of rural England except for southeast Kent and parts of Wales; anywhere in the UK mainland suitable for roe deer may have a population. Not being a species that needs large areas of woodland to survive, urban roe deer are now a feature of several cities, notably Glasgow and Bristol, where in particular they favour cemeteries. In Wales, they are least common, but they are reasonably well established in Powys and Monmouthshire.

===Iran===
Roe deer are found in northern Iran in the Caspian region: they occur in the Hyrcanian woodlands and agricultural lands of the Alborz Mountains (Golestan National Park, Jahan Nama Protected Area).

===Ireland===
Scottish roe deer were introduced to the Lissadell Estate in County Sligo in Ireland around 1870 by Sir Henry Gore-Booth. The Lissadell roe deer were noted for their occasional abnormal antlers and survived in that general area for about 50 years before they died out. According to the National Biodiversity Data Centre, in 2014 there was a confirmed sighting of roe deer in County Armagh. There have been other, unconfirmed, sightings in County Wicklow.

===The Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, roe deer were extirpated from the entirety of the country except for two small areas around 1875. As new forests were planted in the country in the 20th century, the population began to expand rapidly. Although it was a protected species in 1950, the population is no longer considered threatened and it has lost legal protection. As of 2016 there are some 110,000 roe deer in the country. The population is primarily kept in check through the efforts of hunters.

=== Israel ===
In 1991, a breeding colony of 27 roe deer coming from France, Hungary and Italy were brought in the Hai-Bar Carmel Reserve. A small number of this roe deer population has been reintroduced to the Carmel Mountains from the Carmel Hai-Bar Nature Reserve, with the first deer being released in 1996. 24 to 29 animals had been released by 2006. Some of the reintroduced animals were hand-reared and could be monitored by their responses to their keeper calls.

==Ecology==
===Habitat===
This species can utilize a large number of habitats, including open agricultural areas and above the tree line, but a requisite factor is access to food and cover. It retreats to dense woodland, especially among conifers, or bramble scrub when it must rest, but it is very opportunistic and a hedgerow may be good enough. Roe deer in the southern Czech Republic live in almost completely open agricultural land. The animal is more likely to be spotted in places with nearby forests to retreat to. A pioneer species commonly associated with biotic communities at an early stage of succession, during the Neolithic period in Europe when farming humans began to colonise the continent from the Middle East, the roe deer was abundant, taking advantage of areas of forest or woodland cleared by Neolithic farmers.

===Behaviour===
In order to mitigate risk, roe deer remain within refuge habitats (such as forests) during the day. They are likelier to venture into more open habitats at night and during crepuscular periods when there is less ambient activity. It scrapes leaf litter off the ground to make a &#x27;bed&#x27;.

When alarmed it will bark a sound much like a dog and flash out its white rump patch. Rump patches differ between the sexes, with the white rump patches heart-shaped on females and kidney-shaped on males. Males may also bark or make a low grunting noise. Does (the females) make a high-pitched &quot;pheep&quot; whine to attract males during the rut (breeding season) in July and August. Initially the female goes looking for a mate and commonly lures the buck back into her territory before mating. The roe deer is territorial, and while the territories of a male and a female might overlap, other roe deer of the same sex are excluded unless they are the doe&#x27;s offspring of that year.

===Diet===

It feeds mainly on grass, leaves, berries, and young shoots. It particularly likes very young, tender grass with a high moisture content, i.e., grass that has received rain the day before. Roe deer will generally not venture into a field that has or has had livestock in it.

===Reproduction===

The polygamous roe deer males clash over territory in early summer and mate in early autumn. During courtship, when the males chase the females, they often flatten the underbrush, leaving behind areas of the forest in the shape of a circle or figure eight called &#x27;roe rings&#x27;. These tend to be in diameter. In 1956 it was speculated based on some field evidence that they choose where to form rings around plants with ergot mould, but this has not been substantiated further. Males may also use their antlers to shovel around fallen foliage and soil as a way of attracting a mate. Roebucks enter rutting inappetence during the July and August breeding season. Females are monoestrous and after delayed implantation usually give birth the following June, after a 10-month gestation period, typically to two spotted fawns of opposite sexes. The fawns remain hidden in long grass from predators; they are suckled by their mother several times a day for around three months. Young female roe deer can begin to reproduce when they are around six months old. During the mating season, a male roe deer may mount the same doe several times over a duration of several hours.

===Population ecology===
A roe deer can live up to 20 years, but it usually does not reach such an age. A normal life span in the wild is seven to eight years, or ten years.

The roe deer population shows irruptive growth. It is extremely fecund and can double its population every year; it shows a retarded reaction to population density with females continuing to have a similar fecundity at high population densities.

Population structure is modified by available nutrition, where populations are irrupting there are few animals over six years old. Where populations are stagnant or moribund, there is huge fawn mortality and a large part of the population is over seven years old. Mortality is highest in the first weeks after birth due to predation, or sometimes farm machinery; or in the first winter due to starvation or disease, with up to 90% mortality.

===Community ecology===
It is a main prey of the Persian leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus tulliana&quot;) in the Alborz Mountains of Iran.

The nematode &quot;Spiculopteragia asymmetrica&quot; infects this deer.

Compared to the other large herbivores and omnivores in Iran, it is a poor disperser of plant seeds, despite consuming relatively more of them.

==Uses==
The roe deer is a game animal of great economic value in Europe, providing large amounts of meat and earning millions of euros in sport hunting. In 1998, some 2,500,000 roe deer were shot per year in Western Europe. In Germany alone, 700,000 were shot a year in the 1990s. This is insufficient to slow down the population growth, and the roe deer continues to increase in number.

It is the main source of venison in Europe. The meat, like most game meat, is darker in colour than that of most farm-raised deer.

==Palaeontology==
Roe deer are thought to have evolved from a species in the Eurasian genus &quot;Procapreolus&quot;, with some 10 species occurring from the Late Miocene to the Early Pleistocene, which moved from the east to Central Europe over the millennia, where &quot;Procapreolus cusanus&quot; (also classified as &quot;Capreolus cusanus&quot;) occurred. It may not have evolved from &quot;C. cusanus&quot;, however, because the two extant species split from each other 1.375 and 2.75 Myr ago, and the western species first appeared in Europe 600 thousand years ago.

As of 2008, over 3,000 fossil specimens of this species had been recovered from Europe, which affords a good set of data to elucidate the prehistoric distribution. The distribution of the European species has fluctuated often since entering Europe. During some periods of the last ice age, it was present in central Europe, but during the Last Glacial Maximum it retreated to refugia in the Iberian Peninsula (two refugia here), southern France, Italy (likely two), the Balkans and the Carpathians. When the last Ice Age ended, the species initially abruptly expanded north of the Alps to Germany during the Greenland Interstadial, 12.5–10.8 thousand years ago, but during the cooling of the Younger Dryas, 10.8–10 thousand years ago, it appears to have disappeared again from this region. It reappeared 9.7–9.5 thousand years ago, reaching northern central Europe. The modern population in this area appears to have recolonised it from the Carpathians and/or further east, but not the Balkans or other refugia. This is opposite to the red deer, which recolonised Europe from Iberia. There has been much admixture of these populations where they meet, also possibly due to human intervention in some cases.

It is thought that during the Middle Ages the two species of roe deer were kept apart due to hunting pressure and an abundance of predators; the different species may have met in the period just before that, and yet, during the Ice Age they were also kept apart.

==Conservation==
Populations are increasing throughout Europe; it is considered a species of &#x27;least concern&#x27;.

==Culture==
In the Hebrew Bible Deuteronomy 14:5, the , &quot;yahmur&quot;, derived from &#x27;to be red&#x27;, is listed as the third species of animal that may be eaten. In most Bibles this word has usually been translated as &#x27;roe deer&#x27;, and it still means as much in Arabic (, pronounced &quot;&#x27;ahmar&quot;) -it was still said to be a common species in the Mount Carmel area in the 19th century. The King James Bible translated the word as &#x27;fallow deer&#x27;, and in other English Bible translations the word has been translated as a number of different species. When Modern Hebrew was reconstructed to serve as the language of the future Israel in late Ottoman and British Mandatory Palestine, the King James Bible interpretation was chosen, despite the fallow deer being fallow, not red.

Bambi, the titular character of the book &quot;Bambi, A Life in the Woods&quot; and its sequel &quot;Bambi&#x27;s Children&quot; was originally a roe deer. When the story was adapted to the animated film &quot;Bambi&quot; by Walt Disney Pictures, the main character was changed to a white-tailed deer.

Albino roe deer were exceedingly rare in history, and they were regarded as national treasures or sacred animals in ancient times in China.

<text>Billy Beer is a brand of beer first made in the United States in July 1977, by the Falls City Brewing Company. It was promoted by Billy Carter, whose older brother Jimmy was then the president of the United States. In October 1978, Falls City announced that it was closing after less than a year of Carter&#x27;s promotion. The beer was produced by Cold Spring Brewing, West End Brewing, and Pearl Brewing Company. In 2018, Uptown Brewing Company and Billy Beer, Inc. entered into a partnership with Greene County, North Carolina to build a production facility at the North West Greene Industrial Park.

==Endorsement printed on beer cans==
Written on each can were these words of endorsement, which were followed by Billy Carter&#x27;s signature:
Brewed expressly for and with the personal approval of one of AMERICA&#x27;s all-time Great Beer Drinkers—Billy Carter.
I had this beer brewed up just for me. I think it&#x27;s the best I ever tasted. And I&#x27;ve tasted a lot. I think you&#x27;ll like it, too.

Despite Carter&#x27;s promotion of Billy Beer, &quot;in private he drank Pabst&quot;.

==As a collectible==

After Billy Beer ceased production in 1978, advertisements appeared in newspapers offering to sell Billy Beer cans for several hundred to several thousands of dollars each, attempting to profit from their perceived rarity. However, since the cans were actually produced in the millions, the real value of a can ranged from 50 cents to one dollar in 1981.

==In popular media==
In the 22nd episode of season 3 of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Otto Show,&quot; Homer Simpson pulls a can of Billy Beer from the pocket of his &quot;concert-going jacket,&quot; presumably from the last concert he had attended when he was younger, and drinks the beer.

In the eighth episode of season 9 of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Lisa the Skeptic,&quot; Homer is hoarding Billy Beer cans, anticipating that they will rise in value. He drinks one of the beers and says wistfully, &quot;We elected the wrong Carter.&quot;

In the opening of &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Quackbusters&quot;, Daffy Duck works as a DeLorean salesman and offers &quot;a free gift pack of ice-cold Billy Beer with each and every purchase.&quot;

In the episode &quot;Shoeway to Heaven&quot; of season 9 of &quot;Married With Children&quot;, Al is dumbfounded and asks the reporter &quot;well what happened in the seventies?&quot; to which the reporter replies &quot;the Ford Pinto, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and Billy Beer.&quot;

Over ten songs about Billy Beer were released in the 1970s and early &#x27;80s.

<text>OPEN LOOK (sometimes referred to as Open Look) is a graphical user interface (GUI) specification for UNIX workstations. It was originally defined in the late 1980s by Sun Microsystems and AT&amp;T Corporation.

==History==
OPEN LOOK was created at a time when there was little or no standardization in Unix graphical user interfaces (GUIs); the X Window System was emerging as the likely de facto standard for Unix graphical displays, but its designers had deliberately chosen not to specify any look and feel guidelines, leaving this up to application and window manager developers. At the same time, there was increasing use of GUIs in non-UNIX operating systems: the Apple Macintosh was released in early 1984, followed by Microsoft Windows 1.0 and Amiga Workbench in 1985.

As AT&amp;T contemplated its next major revision to Unix, which would eventually become SVR4, it was believed by many that in order to remain competitive with other operating systems, Unix should have a standard GUI definition. One other concern of the time was legal exposure surrounding intellectual property: in March 1988, Apple filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, claiming that Microsoft had copied the Macintosh look and feel.

The OPEN LOOK specification was a collaboration between Sun and AT&amp;T, who were then partnering in the development of SVR4. Xerox PARC was also credited for having not only done the pioneering work in the industry for graphical user interfaces, but also for contributing to OPEN LOOK&#x27;s &quot;design, review, implementation, testing, and refinement&quot;. Involving Xerox, including licensing technology from them, was felt to serve as protection from any future legal entanglements.

The specification was announced in April 1988. The following month, a group of competitors to AT&amp;T and Sun formed the Open Software Foundation (OSF), as a counter to their collaborative efforts. The OSF created the Motif GUI as its alternative to OPEN LOOK.

== Description ==

OPEN LOOK is distinguished by its buttons, triangle glyphs to indicate pull-down and pull-right menus, and &quot;pushpins&quot; which allowed the user to make dialog boxes and palettes stay visible. The overall philosophy was to provide a clean, simple and uncluttered interface, so that the user&#x27;s focus would be on the application rather than the interface. In fact, the original OPEN LOOK design was black and white only; a &quot;three-dimensional&quot; look and feel with shading was added later, in response to the 3-D style effects in Motif.

It is a definition of a look and feel rather than a specific implementation, so it could actually be implemented with different programming toolkits or even on different underlying window systems; implementations were created for both the X Window System and Sun&#x27;s NeWS.

Sun developed an X Window System distribution implementing the OPEN LOOK look and feel, calling it OpenWindows. Developers building OPEN LOOK applications could choose between two graphical programming libraries: the OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit (OLIT) or XView. The former was built on the Xt Intrinsics toolkit common to X; the latter used the same programming interface paradigm as the GUI libraries for Sun&#x27;s earlier SunView window system, making it relatively easy for developers to migrate applications from SunView to X.

There was also The NeWS Toolkit, or TNT, which as the name implies implemented OPEN LOOK for NeWS applications; support for NeWS applications was removed from OpenWindows in 1993.

In 1990, Unix System Laboratories (USL) inherited OLIT from AT&amp;T along with UNIX. Not long after, the codebase for OLIT diverged as Sun and USL took its development in different directions. Sun continued to enhance its version to make its look and feel more consistent with XView. USL, in an attempt to create an API to make applications GUI independent, developed MoOLIT (from Motif OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit), which kept the OLIT API, but allowed users to choose which GUI they wanted at run time. The source to MoOLIT was licensed by MJM Software, who ported it to several other Unix platforms. It was used for several years, almost exclusively by AT&amp;T and Lucent Technologies, who wanted to give their existing OPEN LOOK applications a Motif look and feel. It was not widely used elsewhere.

== Demise ==

By June 1993, the major UNIX players, including AT&amp;T and Sun, had decided that a truly unified Unix was necessary in order to better compete against Microsoft and had formed the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative. The unified desktop for this initiative became the Common Desktop Environment (CDE), and the look and feel chosen for it was based on Motif. Sun announced its plans to immediately offer Motif and start retiring OpenWindows, by then the predominant implementation of the OPEN LOOK look and feel.

Sun began by offering the Motif developer toolkit and MWM window manager as a standalone product for use with Solaris until CDE was released in 1995. OpenWindows remained the primary Solaris desktop environment until 1997, when CDE became the primary desktop for Solaris 2.6. Even then, OpenWindows was still included with Solaris and could continue to be used instead of CDE.

When Solaris 9 was released in 2002, development support for XView and OLIT-based applications was finally removed, as were the olwm window manager and the OPEN LOOK versions of the DeskSet productivity tools. Applications already developed using XView and OLIT can still be executed and displayed in both Solaris 9 and 10, but are no longer supported as native applications in Solaris 11.

There are at least two projects continuing development of OPEN LOOK software: &quot;OWAcomp&quot; makes it possible to still use the OPEN LOOK DeskSet tools, as well as compile OPEN LOOK applications; &quot;openlook&quot; is based on OpenWindows code released as open source, but has added additional components that were not open sourced by Sun.

<text>Richard Earl Thomas (born June 13, 1951) is an American actor. He is best known for his leading role as budding author John-Boy Walton in the CBS drama series &quot;The Waltons&quot; for which he won an Emmy Award. He also received another Emmy nomination and two Golden Globe Award nominations for that role.

Thomas later starred as Bill Denbrough in the 1990 television miniseries adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s epic horror novel &quot;It&quot;, and played Special Agent Frank Gaad on FX&#x27;s spy thriller series &quot;The Americans&quot;. More recently, he appeared in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Ozark&quot; and portrayed Atticus Finch in the 2022-2024 tour of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird.&quot; 

== Early life and education ==
Thomas was born on June 13, 1951, in Manhattan, the son of Barbara Fallis and Richard S. Thomas. His parents were dancers with the New York City Ballet and owned the New York School of Ballet.

Thomas has a birthmark on his left cheek. He has stated that this led to his being turned down for a role in a television commercial in his youth.

Thomas was educated at two private day schools for boys, first at Allen-Stevenson School, and then at the now-defunct McBurney School, both in his home district of Manhattan, New York City.

He was a student at Columbia College, the undergraduate college of Columbia University, where he majored in Chinese before switching to the English department. After he landed the role in &quot;The Waltons&quot;, he left Columbia during his junior year to commit to the role full-time in Los Angeles.

==Acting career==

In 1958, at age seven, Thomas made his Broadway debut in &quot;Sunrise at Campobello&quot;. In 1959, he appeared in the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; NBC television presentation of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; with Julie Harris, Christopher Plummer, and Hume Cronyn. He then began acting in daytime TV, appearing in soap operas such as &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; (as Ben Schultz, 1961), &quot;A Flame in the Wind&quot; and &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (as Tom Hughes, 1966–67) which were broadcast from his native Manhattan. In 1970, he guest starred in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Bonanza&quot; (&quot;The Weary Willies&quot;).

Thomas&#x27;s first major film roles were in the auto racing drama &quot;Winning&quot; (1969) with Paul Newman and the coming-of-age story &quot;Last Summer&quot; (also 1969) with Bruce Davison and Barbara Hershey.

In 1971 Thomas appeared in &quot;The Todd Killings&quot;, a psychological thriller released by National General Pictures, directed by Barry Shear and co-starring Robert F. Lyons, Belinda Montgomery and Barbara Bel Geddes, based on the true crimes of serial killer Charles Schmid. Also in 1971, he starred in &quot;Red Sky at Morning&quot;, and played the lead in the independent production &quot;Cactus in the Snow&quot;.

Beginning in 1972, Thomas became recognized worldwide for his portrayal of John-Boy Walton in the TV series &quot;The Waltons,&quot; based on the life story of writer Earl Hamner, Jr. He appeared in the original CBS television film &quot;The Homecoming: A Christmas Story&quot; in 1971, which inspired the commissioning of the otherwise largely recast series, The Waltons, and then played the role of John-Boy Walton continuously in 122 episodes. In March 1977, Thomas left the series and his role was taken over by Robert Wightman. However, Thomas returned to the role in three &quot;Waltons&quot; TV movies in the 1990s, including &quot;A Walton Thanksgiving Reunion&quot; in 1993. Thomas won an Emmy Award for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series in 1973.

Thomas played against type as murderer and rapist Kenneth Kinsolving in &quot;You&#x27;ll Like My Mother&quot; in 1972 with Patty Duke. He played the lead roles of Private Henry Fleming in the NBC TV movie &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; in 1974 and Paul Baumer in the 1979 CBS TV movie on &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;.

In other TV films, he played Col. Warner&#x27;s younger son Jim in &quot;&quot; (the 1979 sequel to 1977&#x27;s &quot;Roots&quot;), the title role in the biopic &quot;Living Proof: The Hank Williams Jr. Story&quot; in 1983, Will Mossup in CBS&#x27;s &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; in 1983, Henry Durie in &quot;The Master of Ballantrae&quot; for Hallmark Hall of Fame, Martin Campbell in &quot;Final Jeopardy&quot;, and the adult Bill Denbrough in the 1990 television mini-series &quot;It&quot;, adapted from Stephen King&#x27;s horror novel.

In 1980, Thomas made his first Broadway appearance in more than 12 years when he was a replacement in Lanford Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Fifth of July&quot;. In the same year, he appeared as Shad (the young farmer entrusted to employ mercenaries to save his planet from Sador and his invading forces) in &quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot;.

In 1987, he appeared on stage in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., in the one-man tour-de-force &quot;Citizen Tom Paine&quot; (playing Paine &quot;like a star-spangled tiger, ferocious about freedom and ready to savage anyone who stands in his way,&quot; in a staging of Howard Fast&#x27;s play set in the bicentennial year of the United States Constitution). In 1990, he joined with Nathan Lane at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles for Terrence McNally&#x27;s &quot;The Lisbon Traviata&quot; in the role of Stephan. In 1993, he played the title role in a Shakespeare Theater stage production of &quot;Richard II&quot; in Washington, D.C.

Thomas starred in the ABC TV movie &quot;Death in Small Doses&quot;, directed by Sondra Locke. He starred with Maureen O&#x27;Hara and his &quot;It&quot; co-star Annette O&#x27;Toole in the Hallmark Channel movie &quot;The Christmas Box&quot; in 1995.

Thomas appeared in a quartet of performances at the Hartford Stage in Connecticut including &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1987), &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; (1989), &quot;Richard III&quot; (1994) and &quot;Tiny Alice&quot; (1996). In 1997 and 1998, he played degenerate Joe Greene in two episodes of &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; and four episodes of &quot;Promised Land.

In 2001, he appeared in London&#x27;s West End in a theatre production of Yasmina Reza&#x27;s &quot;Art&quot; with Judd Hirsch. He also appeared on the New York stage in The Public Theater&#x27;s production in Central Park of &quot;As You Like It&quot; in 2005, Michael Frayn&#x27;s &quot;Democracy&quot; on Broadway in 2004, and the Primary Stages&#x27; off-Broadway production of Terrence McNally&#x27;s &quot;The Stendhal Syndrome&quot; in the same year.

He hosted the PAX TV series &quot;It&#x27;s a Miracle&quot;. He starred in the series &quot;Just Cause&quot; in 2003 for the PAX TV network.

In 2005, he appeared in the Richard Greenburg Broadway debut of &quot;A Naked Girl on the Appian Way&quot;.
In 2006, Thomas began an American theater tour of Reginald Rose&#x27;s play &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; along with &quot;Cheers&quot; star George Wendt at the Shubert Theater in New Haven, Connecticut, playing the pivotal role of Juror Eight opposite Wendt&#x27;s Juror One.

In 2009 and 2010, Thomas was featured on Broadway in &quot;Race&quot;, a play by David Mamet. The production was directed by Mamet and included James Spader, David Alan Grier, and Kerry Washington. In February and March 2011, he starred at the off-Broadway New York Public Theater in &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;.

Thomas played Frank Gaad in the FX Network period spy drama television series &quot;The Americans&quot; which debuted in January 2013.

Thomas appeared in the 2017 Broadway revival of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; and was nominated for a 2017 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play.

In December 2018, Thomas portrayed Ebenezer Scrooge in Pittsburgh CLO&#x27;s production of &quot;A Musical Christmas Carol&quot;.

In February 2021, Thomas portrayed Bodie Lord in the Amazon thriller drama television series &quot;Tell Me Your Secrets&quot;, appearing in episode 5.

In January 2022, Thomas portrayed Wendy Byrde&#x27;s estranged father, Nathan Davis, in three episodes of season 4 of the Netflix series &quot;Ozark&quot;.

Starting in April 2022, Thomas starred as Atticus Finch in a National Broadway tour of a stage production of Harper Lee&#x27;s novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.

In 2024, Thomas played Professor Webb in Thornton Wilder&#x27;s play &quot;Our Town&quot;, with Jim Parsons and Katie Holmes.

<text>Narrowband signals are signals that occupy a narrow range of frequencies or that have a small fractional bandwidth. In the audio spectrum, &quot;narrowband sounds&quot; are sounds that occupy a narrow range of frequencies. In telephony, narrowband is usually considered to cover frequencies 300–3400 Hz, i.e. the voiceband.

In radio communications, a narrowband channel is a channel in which the bandwidth of the message does not significantly exceed the channel&#x27;s coherence bandwidth.

In the study of wired channels, &quot;narrowband&quot; implies that the channel under consideration is sufficiently narrow that its frequency response can be considered flat. The message bandwidth will therefore be less than the coherence bandwidth of the channel. That is, no channel has perfectly flat fading, but the analysis of many aspects of wireless systems is greatly simplified if flat fading can be assumed.

==Two-way radio narrowband==
Two-Way Radio Narrowbanding refers to a U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Order issued in December 2004 requiring all CFR 47 Part 90 VHF (150–174 MHz) and UHF (421–470 MHz) PLMR (Private Land Mobile Radio) licensees operating legacy wideband (25 kHz bandwidth) voice or data/SCADA systems to migrate to narrowband (12.5 kHz bandwidth or equivalent) systems by 1 January 2013.

<doc id="274799" wikidata="Q389906" url="?curid=274799" title="Culhwch and Olwen">
<text>Culhwch and Olwen () is a Welsh tale that survives in only two manuscripts about a hero connected with Arthur and his warriors: a complete version in the Red Book of Hergest, , and a fragmented version in the White Book of Rhydderch, . It is the longest of the surviving Welsh prose tales. Lady Charlotte Guest included this tale among those she collected under the title &quot;The Mabinogion&quot;. 

==Synopsis==
Culhwch&#x27;s father, King Cilydd son of Celyddon, loses his wife Goleuddydd after a difficult childbirth. When he remarries, the young Culhwch rejects his stepmother&#x27;s attempt to pair him with his new stepsister. Offended, the new queen puts a curse on him so that he can marry no one besides the beautiful Olwen, daughter of the giant Ysbaddaden Pencawr. Though he has never seen her, Culhwch becomes infatuated with her, but his father warns him that he will never find her without the aid of his famous cousin Arthur. The young man immediately sets off to seek his kinsman. He finds him at his court in Celliwig in Cornwall.

Arthur agrees to lend help in whatever capacity Culhwch asks, save the lending of his sword Caledfwlch and other named armaments, or his wife. He sends not only six of his finest warriors (Cai, Bedwyr, Gwalchmei, Gwrhyr Gwalstawd Ieithoedd, Menw son of Tairgwaedd, Cynddylig Gyfarwydd), but a huge list of personages of various skills (including Gwynn ap Nudd) recruited to join Culhwch in his search for Olwen. The group meets some relatives of Culhwch&#x27;s that know Olwen and agree to arrange a meeting. Olwen is receptive to Culhwch&#x27;s attraction, but she cannot marry him unless her father Ysbaddaden &quot;Chief Giant&quot; agrees, and he, unable to survive past his daughter&#x27;s wedding, will not consent until Culhwch completes a series of about forty impossible-sounding tasks, including the obtaining of the basket/hamper of Gwyddneu Garanhir, the hunt of Ysgithyrwyn chief boar. The completion of only a few of these tasks is recorded and the giant is killed, leaving Olwen free to marry her lover.

== Scholarship ==
The prevailing view among scholars was that the present version of the text was composed by the 11th century, making it perhaps the earliest Arthurian tale and one of Wales&#x27; earliest extant prose texts, but a 2005 reassessment by linguist Simon Rodway dates it to the latter half of the 12th century. The title is a later invention and does not occur in early manuscripts. 

The story is on one level a folktale, belonging to the bridal quest &quot;the giant&#x27;s daughter&quot; tale type (more formally categorized as Six Go through the Whole World type, AT 513A). The accompanying motifs (the strange birth, the jealous stepmother, the hero falling in love with a stranger after hearing only her name, helpful animals, impossible tasks) reinforce this typing. 

However, the bridal quest serves merely as a frame story for the rest of the events that form the in-story, where the title characters go largely unmentioned. The in-story is taken up by two long lists and the adventures of King Arthur and his men. One list is a roster of names, some two hundred of the greatest men, women, dogs, horses and swords in Arthur&#x27;s kingdom recruited to aid Arthur&#x27;s kinsman Culhwch in his bridal quest. The other is a list of &quot;difficult tasks&quot; or &quot;marvels&quot; (&quot;pl.&quot; ), set upon Culhwch as requirements for his marriage to be approved by the bride&#x27;s father Ysbaddaden. Included in this list are names taken from Irish legend, hagiography, and sometimes actual history. 

The fight against the terrible boar Twrch Trwyth certainly has antecedents in Celtic tradition, namely Arthur&#x27;s boar-hunt with his hound Cafall, whose footprint is discussed in the &quot;Mirabilia&quot; appended to the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. The description of Culhwch riding on his horse is frequently mentioned for its vividness, and features of the Welsh landscape are narrated in ways that are reminiscent of Irish onomastic narratives. As for the passage where Culhwch is received by his uncle, King Arthur, at Celliwig, this is one of the earliest instances in literature or oral tradition of Arthur&#x27;s court being assigned a specific location and a valuable source of comparison with the court of Camelot or Caerleon as depicted in later Welsh, English, and continental Arthurian legends.

Culhwch&#x27;s horse-ride passage is reused in the 16th-century prose &quot;parody&quot; &quot;Araith Wgon&quot;, as well as in 17th-century poetic adaptations of that work. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey has pointed out the similarities between &quot;The Tale of Beren and Lúthien&quot;, one of the main cycles of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;legendarium&quot;, and &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;.

==Adaptations==

* British painter/poet David Jones (1895–1974) wrote a poem called &quot;The Hunt&quot; based on the tale of &quot;Culwhch ac Olwen&quot;. A fragment of a larger work, &quot;The Hunt&quot; takes place during the pursuit of the boar Twrch Trwyth by Arthur and the various war-bands of Celtic Britain and France.
* In 1988, Gwyn Thomas released a retelling of the story, &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot;, which was illustrated by Margaret Jones. &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot; won the annual Tir na n-Og Award for Welsh language nonfiction in 1989.
* A shadow play adaptation of &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; toured schools in Ceredigion during 2003. The show was created by Jim Williams and was supported by Theatr Felinfach.
* The tale of &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; was adapted by Derek Webb in Welsh and English as a dramatic recreation for the reopening of Narberth Castle in Pembrokeshire in 2005.
* &quot;The Ballad of Sir Dinadan&quot; (2003), the fifth book of Gerald Morris&#x27;s &quot;The Squire&#x27;s Tales&quot; series, features an adaptation of Culhwch&#x27;s quest.
* &quot;The Quest&quot; (2016) is an artist&#x27;s book by Shirley Jones focusing on the quest, which is to find the whereabouts of the prisoner, Mabon, son of Modron, in &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;.

<doc id="274802" wikidata="Q4912331" url="?curid=274802" title="Billy Carter">
<text>William Alton Carter (March 29, 1937 – September 25, 1988) was an American farmer, businessman, brewer, and politician. The younger brother of U.S. President Jimmy Carter, he promoted Billy Beer and Peanut Lolita; and he was a candidate for mayor of Plains, Georgia.

==Early life==
William Alton &quot;Billy&quot; Carter was the fourth and youngest child of Lillian and James Earl Carter Sr. He attended Emory University,&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost/1988/billy-dies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; served in the United States Marine Corps, and later worked in the Carter family&#x27;s peanut business.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy/billy-carter&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s and later==
In 1970, Billy Carter was managing partner and 15% owner of the Carter family&#x27;s peanut business. By 1976, Billy had increased revenues to $5 million per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/1988-09-26-mn-1791&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Carter purchased a gas and service station in Plains. He owned and operated it for most of the decade. At its peak he sold 2,000 cases of beer a month and more than 40,000 gallons of gas. In 2009, the station became the &quot;Billy Carter Service Station Museum&quot;, via the University of Georgia.

Carter ran for mayor of Plains in 1976 but lost the election, 97 to 71 votes, to A.L. Blanton,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1976/12/07/billy-loses&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; an Albany airport air traffic controller.

In the 1970s, Billy Carter was the official spokesperson for Peanut Lolita liqueur.

In 1977, although a Pabst Blue Ribbon drinker, he endorsed Billy Beer, introduced by the Falls City Brewing Company, who wished to capitalize upon his colorful image as a beer-drinking Southern good ol&#x27; boy.&lt;ref name=&quot;newspapers/clip/13776945&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Billy Carter&#x27;s name was occasionally used as a gag answer for a Washington, D.C. trouble-maker on 1970s episodes of &quot;Match Game&quot;. He was known for his outlandish public behavior; he once urinated on an airport runway in full view of the press and dignitaries.
By 1979, he drank half a gallon of vodka and whiskey a day.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/1990-01-27-li-769&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1979, Carter was admitted to seven weeks of rehabilitation at the Long Beach, California Navy Hospital alcohol treatment facility.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc/billy-dies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;calisphere/21198/zz0002rkdf&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He later became sober and reportedly extended support to other addicts in their own recovery.

In 1981, he was forced to sell his Plains properties to pay taxes and debts and moved to Haleyville, Alabama where he worked in sales for Tidwell Industries. In 1985, he became Vice President of Scott Housing Systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica/Billy-Carter&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Libya==
In late 1978 and early 1979, Billy Carter visited Libya three times with a contingent from Georgia. He eventually registered as a foreign agent of the Libyan government and received a $220,000 loan of which, The New York Times speculated,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1988/09/26/billy-carter&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; only $1,000 was repaid. However, Edwin P. Wilson claimed he had seen a telegram showing that Libya paid Billy Carter $2 million. This led to a Senate hearing on alleged influence peddling which the press named Billygate. A Senate sub-committee was called &quot;To Investigate Activities of Individuals Representing Interests of Foreign Governments (Billy Carter—Libya Investigation)&quot;.
A 1985 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article suggested that a series of Billygate articles written by Michael Ledeen and published in &quot;The New Republic&quot; in October 1980 were intended to influence the outcome of that year&#x27;s presidential election. According to the reporting, Francesco Pazienza, an officer of the Italian intelligence agency SISMI, alleged that Ledeen was handed Billygate information by the Italian Intelligence agency and he co-authored the articles with Arnaud de Borchgrave. Pazienza was later tried and convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; for using &quot;extortion and fraud to obtain embarrassing facts about Billy Carter&quot;.

==Death==
Carter was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the fall of 1987 and received unsuccessful treatments for the disease. He died in Plains the following year at age 51, five years after the death of his sister, Ruth Carter Stapleton, who also died of pancreatic cancer at age 54. One and a half years following his death, his older sister, Gloria Carter Spann, died at age 63 from pancreatic cancer. Their father, James Earl Carter Sr., also died of the disease at age 58. His mother, Bessie Lillian Gordy, died from breast cancer at age 85.

After Billy died, his wife Sybil opened a cafe.&lt;ref name=&quot;booknotes/62763-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="274804" wikidata="Q1095773" url="?curid=274804" title="Clark University">
<text>Clark University is a private research university in Worcester, Massachusetts, United States. Founded in 1887 with a large endowment from its namesake Jonas Gilman Clark, a prominent businessman, Clark was one of the first modern research universities in the United States. Originally an all-graduate institution, Clark&#x27;s first undergraduates entered in 1902 and women were first enrolled in 1942.

The university offers 46 majors, minors, and concentrations in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering and allows students to design specialized majors and engage in pre-professional programs. It is a member of the Higher Education Consortium of Central Massachusetts, which enables students to cross-register at other Worcester institutions including the Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the College of the Holy Cross. 

Clark is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. It was a founding member of the Association of American Universities, but departed in 1999. The university competes intercollegiately in 17 NCAA Division III varsity sports as the Clark Cougars and is a part of the New England Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s Athletic Conference. Clark faculty, alumni, and affiliates have included business executives and inventors of the wind chill factor and the birth control pill.

==History==
===Founding and early history===
On January 17, 1887, successful American businessman Jonas Gilman Clark announced his intention to found and endow a university in the city of Worcester, filing a petition in the Massachusetts Legislature requesting a charter for Clark University. An Act of Incorporation was duly enacted by the legislature and signed by the governor on March 31 of that same year. Clark University was to incorporate the best features of universities in continental Europe and America, particularly Cornell University and Johns Hopkins.

Clark was a friend of Leland Stanford and was inspired by the plans for Stanford University, as well as Cornell and Johns Hopkins. Clark founded the university with an endowment of one million dollars, and later added another million dollars because he feared the university might someday face a lack of funds. Opening on October 2, 1889, Clark was the first all-graduate university in the United States, with departments in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology.

G. Stanley Hall was appointed the first president of Clark University in 1888. He had been a professor of psychology and pedagogy at Johns Hopkins University, which had been founded just a few years prior and was quickly becoming a model of the modern research university. Hall spent seven months in Europe visiting other universities and recruiting faculty. He became the founder of the American Psychological Association and earned the first PhD in psychology in the United States at Harvard. Clark has played a prominent role in the development of psychology as a distinguished discipline in the United States ever since. Franz Boas, founder of American cultural anthropology and adviser for the first PhD in anthropology which was granted at Clark in 1891, taught at Clark from 1888 until 1892 when he resigned in a dispute with President Hall over academic freedom and joined the faculty of Columbia University. Albert A. Michelson, the first American to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics, best known for his involvement in the Michelson–Morley experiment, which measured the speed of light, was a professor from 1889 to 1892 before becoming head of the physics department at the University of Chicago.

Jonas G. Clark died in 1900, leaving gifts to the university and campus library, but reserving half of his estate for the foundation of an undergraduate college. This had been strongly opposed by President Hall in years past, but Clark College opened in 1902, managed independently of Clark University. Clark College and Clark University had different presidents until Hall&#x27;s retirement in 1920. Clark University began admitting women after Clark&#x27;s death, and the first female PhD in psychology was awarded in 1908. Early PhD students in psychology were ethnically diverse, with several early graduates being Japanese. In 1920, Francis Sumner became the first African American to earn a PhD in psychology.

Clark University, along with Stanford and Johns Hopkins, was one of the fourteen founding members of the Association of American Universities, an organization of universities with the most prestigious profiles in research and graduate education, and was one of only three New England universities, along with Harvard and Yale, to be a founding member. Clark withdrew its membership in 1999, citing a conflict with its mission.

===Clark Lectures===
In order to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Clark&#x27;s opening, President Hall invited a number of leading thinkers to the university. Among them was Sigmund Freud who, accompanied by Carl Jung, delivered his five famous &quot;Clark Lectures&quot; there over the course of five days in September 1909, introducing psychoanalysis to an American audience. This was Freud&#x27;s only visit to the United States. Clark granted Freud an honorary degree, which hangs in the Sigmund Freud House in Vienna, Austria. It was one of the few official distinctions Freud received during his lifetime.

===Later history===
In the 1920s Robert Goddard, a pioneer of rocketry, considered one of the founders of space and missile technology, was chairman of the Physics Department. The Robert H. Goddard Library is named for him.

The Graduate School of Management (GSOM) was founded in 1982. In 1997, Clark announced the first PhD program in Holocaust Studies in the United States. This after the university convinced Debórah Dwork to leave Yale University and become Clark&#x27;s first professor of Holocaust studies in the prior year.

===2000s===
The Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprise was established in fall 2007 due to a founding gift from two Clark alumni, William &#x27;76 and Jane &#x27;75 Mosakowski.

U.S. Secretary of State and former senator and democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke at Clark University on February 4, 2008, to an audience of approximately 3,500 in the Kneller Athletic Center.

In March 2009, Clark University convened a first-of-its-kind National Conference on Liberal Education and Effective Practice, co-sponsored by Clark&#x27;s Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprise and the Association of American Colleges and Universities.

In April 2009, then-President John Bassett denied Clark University Students for Palestinian Rights, a student group, permission to bring Norman Finkelstein to speak about the &quot;Gaza Massacre&quot; (2008–2009 Gaza War) because Finkelstein &quot;would invite controversy and not dialogue or understanding&quot;. He also cited a conflict in scheduling regarding a conference on Holocaust and Genocide Studies presented by the university in the same month. However, following protests, which included a public protest in the center of campus, a petition campaign and outreach by alumni, students and faculty, Basset reversed his decision and allowed Finkelstein to speak on April 27, the last day of classes for the semester. Finkelstein spoke to around 400 students, faculty and community members in Atwood Hall.

In April 2010, Clark University received the largest gift in its 123-year history, a $14.2 million offering from the late head of Hanover Insurance, one of the nation&#x27;s biggest property and casualty insurers. The gift from John Adam is intended to strengthen Clark&#x27;s graduate programs in education, promote college-readiness among minority students and bolster its research profile related to urban education. This donation created the Adams Education Fund, which will enhance Clark&#x27;s nationally recognized model for urban secondary education and reform, teacher-training, and community education partnerships.

On July 1, 2010, former provost David Angel became the ninth president of Clark, succeeding John Bassett, who went on to become president of Heritage University, located on the Yakama Indian Reservation in Toppenish, Washington.

Clark University has an ongoing renovation project that will cover several buildings. In the summer of 2010, overhauls occurred in Bullock and Wright Hall dormitories.

In summer 2012, Clark University underwent more renovations. The city of Worcester allowed the university to close Downing Street to unite the campus. The area was landscaped to become a pedestrian plaza. Johnson and Sanford halls were united to become the Johnson Sanford Center featuring new social, study, and multimedia spaces. The project included addition of an outdoor roof terrace and an elevator to all levels. The university has recently begun a project called LEEP to connect students and the world of academia to practical experience.
Summer 2016 saw the completion of a new Alumni and Student Engagement Center building, extending the campus across Main Street. The facility is a mixed-use building containing administrative offices, lecture halls, meeting rooms, and some retail space, and features a modern architectural look and a rooftop solar array.

In 2022, graduate students at the university organized as Clark University Graduate Workers United, a chapter of Teamsters Local 170. An NLRB-overseen election resulted in a 100–7 vote in favor of unionization, after which the union and university entered into negotiations. On October 3, 2022, the graduate workers&#x27; union began an indefinite strike over wages, benefits, and working conditions that continued until that Friday, October 7, when the union and the university announced a tentative agreement on a contract. On the following Wednesday, October 13, the union unanimously ratified the contract, which took effect immediately.

The campus is located on Main Street in the Main South neighborhood about west of downtown Worcester and west of Boston. The campus is compact, with most of the major buildings located within the space of a single city block.

The center of campus is known as the Green. The Green is a hub for student activity, and is where most Clarkies spend their time during the warm months. It is the location of Spree Day, the welcome back BBQ, several clubs&#x27; events and graduation. The buildings surrounding The Green include Atwood Hall, Jefferson Academic Center, Higgins University Center, Jonas Clark Hall, and the Goddard Library.

Administrative offices are housed in small buildings along Woodland Street, as is the president&#x27;s house. The new Shaich Family Alumni and Student Engagement Center, named in honor of a $5 million gift from the family of alumnus Ron Shaich, is across Main Street and houses meeting spaces and offices.

===Academic facilities===
Jonas Clark Hall, built in 1887, was Clark University&#x27;s first building. It occupies the center of campus and houses the economics, psychology and education departments. Located in the basement of Jonas Clark Hall is the university&#x27;s cogeneration plant which allows the university to recycle waste heat from electrical generation into hot water, heat, and steam. It was updated in 2013 to a more efficient 2.0 kWh natural gas engine.

Estabrook Hall, located on Woodland Street, is the second oldest building on Clark&#x27;s campus. Originally constructed as a dormitory, it now functions as the language center and the music center. The upper floors are primarily home to classrooms and offices for the Language, Literature, and Culture department, which includes Spanish, French, German, Latin, and Hebrew. The bottom floor and basement are practice rooms and music halls.

The Jefferson Academic Center houses various social science departments including Women&#x27;s Studies, Geography, History, Geographical Information Sciences, Political Science, and Sociology.

Atwood Hall, attached to the Jefferson Academic Center, is the primary theater on campus and seats 658. Atwood Hall originally served as the chapel for the university, and in recent decades has been the scene for several notable concerts and speeches. The Grateful Dead (1967 and 1969), the Jimi Hendrix Experience (1968), Janis Joplin (1969), and Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band (1974) have all played here. A March 15, 1968, concert by the Jimi Hendrix Experience was professionally recorded and released in 1999 as &quot;Live at Clark University&quot;. In 1963, student D&#x27;Army Bailey invited Malcolm X to speak here. Noam Chomsky spoke here on the topic of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Arab Spring April 12, 2011. It was the first-ever lecture given on a Spree Day at Clark. On October 16, 2014, President Bill Clinton spoke in Atwood as a supporter of Martha Coakley&#x27;s run for Governor of Massachusetts.

The Lasry Center for Bioscience (named for hedge fund manager Marc Lasry and his wife Cathy, both alumni) houses the biology department. It received a LEED Gold certification for its energy efficiency.

The Little Center is the alternate performing arts venue, with its largest room, the Michelson Theater seating 120.

The Academic Commons, also known as the AC, acts as a study area and lounge for the students, and incorporates a Sodexo coffeehouse named Jazzmans, a quiet study area, a computer room, and the Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprises. The Goddard Library is upstairs from the Academic Commons and houses more than 375,000 volumes.

===Libraries===

Clark University has 4 libraries. 
* The Goddard Library, the main library of the university
* The Rose Library at the Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, which contains volumes concerning genocides
* The Jeanne X. Kasperson Research Library, which focuses on environmental research
* The Fuller Resource Library at the Traina Center for the Arts, with performing arts media in its collection

===Athletic facilities===
The Kneller Athletic Center houses the basketball courts, swimming pool, racquet ball courts, handball courts, and the James and Ada B. Bickman Fitness Center which was opened in 1995 and completely renovated in 2013. Major campus events, such as International Gala, the fall concert, and first year orientation are usually held in the Kneller as the basketball courts are the largest rooms on campus and can accommodate the entire student body. The Thomas M. &#x27;62 and Joan E. &#x27;60 Dolan Field House opened in May 2003 at which time the Russ Granger Athletic Fields and Corash Tennis Courts around it were reconfigured and renovated. The Boys and Girls Club Track and Field opened in October 2016.

===Housing===

Students entering Clark must live on campus for the first two years unless their primary address is within of campus. The residence halls at Clark are organized by those who live there:
* First Year Experience halls (Dana, Hughes, Bullock, and Wright)
* Mixed class halls (Johnson-Sanford Center)
* Single sex hall (Dodd—female and non-binary only)
* Suite-style and apartment-style halls (Maywood and Blackstone)

Clark owns apartments that, while outside of the main campus area, exclusively house Clark students.

The first Clark &quot;residence halls&quot; (Wright and Bullock) opened in 1959. Before that time, Estabrook Hall was the men&#x27;s dormitory and small women&#x27;s dorms stood in the current location of Little Center and Bullock Hall. Blackstone, the newest of the halls, opened in 2007.

As of fall 2007, gender blind/neutral housing is an option at Clark, meaning that students of different genders can room together.

Clark University released its Climate Action Plan December 15, 2009, detailing strategies for the university to reduce its carbon footprint while strengthening many of its existing sustainability practices. The plan sets two goals with respect to climate neutrality: First is an interim goal of reducing emissions to 20 percent below 2005-levels by 2015. The second goal is to achieve climate neutrality (net zero greenhouse gas emissions) by the year 2030.

==Organization==
===Clark College===
Clark College opened in 1902 as the fulfillment of founder Jonas Clark&#x27;s desire for an undergraduate liberal arts college. The administration of Clark College and Clark University was formally united in 1920 and undergraduate programs continue today under the university.

===School of Management===
The School of Management (SOM) was founded in 1982. The school offers master&#x27;s degrees as well as undergraduate courses in management, marketing, and innovation and entrepreneurship.

In recent years, Clark has received widespread media coverage for its &quot;Fifth-Year Free&quot; program. Under Clark&#x27;s BA/MA program with the fifth year free, undergraduates who maintain a B+ average are eligible for tuition-free enrollment in its one-year graduate programs, meaning that they can get a Master of Arts degree for the price of a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Students apply to master&#x27;s degree programs in their junior year, begin meeting requirements in their senior year and typically complete those requirements in the fifth year. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees are granted en route to the master&#x27;s degree.

For Fall 2023, Clark received 10,735 freshmen applications; 4,498 were admitted (41.9%). The average high school GPA of the enrolled freshmen was 3.68, while the middle 50% range of SAT scores was 1300-1440. The middle 50% range of the ACT Composite score was 29–33.

==Rankings and recognition==



Undergraduate admission to Clark is rated &quot;more selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

Clark University was featured on Princeton Review&#x27;s 2021 list of best value colleges in the United States and in 2020 it was ranked No.3 of the Top 20 Best Schools for Making an Impact in the United States.

==Student life==
===Student body===
As of fall 2019, Clark&#x27;s student body comprised 2,349 undergraduates and 1,149 graduate and professional students. International students make up 11.5% of undergraduates. In addition, 21% of the undergraduate student body is classified as ALANA (Asian-, Latino-, African-, and Native-American) and 61% of undergraduates are female.

===Residential life===
The majority of the undergraduate student body, 66%, lives on campus. Clark requires undergraduates to do so for their first two years, with first-years being assigned housing based on their responses to a Housing Preferences Form. Once first-years have been assigned housing, a seniority system, whereby seniors have the first choice of spaces left, juniors have the second, and sophomores the third, ensures that seniors and juniors are usually able to live on campus if they wish to. Nonetheless, some choose to live in off-campus apartments in the immediate neighborhood of Clark, along with the graduate students outside the 1% that live on campus.

===Student organizations===
There are more than 130 student clubs and organizations at Clark. All these are headed by the Clark Undergraduate Student Council which disseminates more than $750,000 in budgets to the various clubs and their events.

====Media and publications====
&quot;The Scarlet&quot; is Clark University&#x27;s student newspaper. It is published weekly and has four sections: News, Opinions, Living Arts, and Sports. Clark&#x27;s literary magazine, &quot;Caesura&quot;, is published annually and features artwork, poetry, prose, essays, and creative non-fiction submitted by undergraduate and graduate students. &quot;STIR Magazine&quot;, Clark&#x27;s life, culture, and style magazine was founded by Diana Levine as a student project in 2004. &quot;STIR&quot; began with a three-person staff and in black and white, and now has about 30 core students who contribute to its production in full color. The &quot;Scholarly Undergraduate Research Journal&quot; (&quot;SURJ&quot;) is Clark&#x27;s student-run undergraduate research journal. It publishes undergraduate academic work and is intended to provide undergraduates with &quot;experiences in the peer review and academic publication processes.&quot; Peer reviewers consist of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty. &quot;The Freudian Slip,&quot; is a satire/humor publication founded in 2015. It publishes semi-weekly satirical articles about local and worldwide events. It is also the first university publication published exclusively online.

There is also a student-run internet radio station, Radio of Clark University (ROCU), with over 100 student DJs.

===Events===
Spree Day originated in 1903 to coincide with St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. It is traditional to not tell first-year students about Spree Day. Instead, the Senior class awakens the first-years by running through the quads outside of the residence halls banging pots and pans.

While Spree Day is a day of recreation, Clark University also holds the Academic Spree Day annually during Spring semester. This academic event is when Clark undergraduates present their research and creative work.

==Athletics==
Clark University fields 17 NCAA Division III varsity teams which compete intercollegiately as the Clark Cougars in the New England Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s Athletic Conference. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, and tennis; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, crew, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, and volleyball.

The university also offers a variety of club and intramural sports such as soccer, ice hockey, ultimate frisbee, quidditch, volleyball and basketball. This contributes to Clark&#x27;s 65 percent student participation rate in athletics.

==Clark and the community==
In 1985, the university engaged in a partnership with community groups and business organizations to revitalize Clark neighborhoods. Its efforts in the University Park Partnership program include refurbishing dilapidated or abandoned homes, reselling them to area residents, and subsidizing mortgages for new home buyers.

In 1997, Clark opened a secondary public school, the University Park Campus School (UPCS), that is also a professional development school for Clark&#x27;s teacher education program. Because of its long hours and demanding curricula, UPCS has been lauded as a model for collaboration between a university and an urban district. Students are able to attend Clark University free of charge upon graduation, provided they meet certain residency and admissions requirements. In the May 16, 2005, issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, UPCS was named the 68th best high school in the nation. UPCS was featured in a page-one story entitled &quot;Town-grown triumph: In poorest part of Worcester, Clark helps put children on path to college&quot; of the November 22, 2007, edition of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;.

The UPCS collaborative is one of several sponsored by Clark&#x27;s Jacob Hiatt Center for Urban Education focused on urban teacher education and school reform.

==Research==
Clark has seven research institutes and centers.

The William and Jane Mosakowski Institute for Public Enterprise seeks to improve through the successful mobilization of use-inspired research the effectiveness of government and other institutions in addressing social concerns. The institute focuses on important social issues, including focal areas such as education reform, environmental sustainability, access to healthcare, human development, well-being and global change.

The George Perkins Marsh Institute conducts collaborative, interdisciplinary research on human-environment relationships and the human dimensions of global environmental change.

The Strassler Family Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies an interdisciplinary center, founded in 1998, which focuses on the causes and effects of Holocausts and Genocides around the world. It is housed in Lasry House, donated by investor Marc Lasry and his wife Cathy in honor of their fathers Irwin Cohen and Moise Lasry. Debórah Dwork is the founding director and also Rose Professor of Holocaust History at Clark.

The Jacob Hiatt Center for Urban Education develops models of urban schooling, teaching and teacher education through local partnership, in order to learn from these models and expand the knowledge-base of effective practice through research.

The Center for Risk and Security (CRS) at the George Perkins Marsh Institute conducts in-depth studies of homeland security issues using a risk-analysis perspective. The center&#x27;s broad range of security issues includes: terrorism; disaster management; law and human rights; resource availability; and public health.

The Center for Technology, Environment and Development (CENTED), founded in 1987, is a center for the study of natural and technological hazards in the United States. Projects include theoretical work on hazard analysis, hazard taxonomies, vulnerability, environmental equity, corporate risk management, emergency planning and hazardous waste transportation.

Clark Labs is engaged in the research and development on geospatial technologies including the development of computer software and analytical techniques for GIS and remote sensing with an emphasis on monitoring and modeling earth system dynamics. Clark Labs continues to develop and distribute TerrSet (formerly IDRISI), a geographic information system (GIS) software package that is in use at more than 40,000 sites in over 180 countries worldwide. Its chief is Dr. J. Ronald Eastman, creator of IDRISI.

==Notable people==

The university&#x27;s most famous alumnus was graduate student and professor Robert H. Goddard, a pioneering rocket scientist who conducted many experiments on campus. Clark&#x27;s first president, G. Stanley Hall, founded the American Psychological Association in July 1892 at Clark. Grayson L. Kirk, a president of the Council on Foreign Relations during the Cold War and the president of Columbia University during the student protests of 1968 received his master&#x27;s degree from the university, as did D&#x27;Army Bailey a prominent civil rights activist and the founder of the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee. Clark is also notable for being the site of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s only lectures in the United States and for being the university where Chinese poet Xu Zhimo earned his BA.

==In popular culture==
Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;The Sea of Trees&quot; was filmed in part on Clark University&#x27;s campus. Leading actor Matthew McConaughey&#x27;s character, Arthur Brennan, is a physics professor and scenes were filmed in and around Clark&#x27;s Sackler Sciences Center. Clark was also a shooting location for the thriller &quot;Black Car&quot;, an independent film about a law student out for revenge, with Clark as the law school. The novel &quot;Something for Nothing&quot;, a semi-comic take on the struggles of a professor new to academia written by economist Michael W. Klein, is set at the fictional &quot;Kester College,&quot; which like Clark University has a large main building that legend says was designed so that it could be converted into a factory should the college fail. Klein began his teaching career at Clark. &quot;Burning Annie&quot;, an independent comedy, was written and produced by two Clark alumni and is a semi-autobiographical film based on the experiences of one at Clark. One of the main characters in Annie Baker&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;The Flick&quot;, an African American movie usher named Avery, is a Clarkie with a full-ride to attend the university.

<text>The Sluagh (, ; ; English: &#x27;host, army, crowd&#x27;), or Sluagh na marbh (&#x27;host of the dead&#x27;), were the hosts of the unforgiven dead in Irish and Scottish folklore. In the words of British folklorist Lewis Spence, &quot;In the Western Isles of Scotland the Sluagh, or fairy host, was regarded as composed of the souls of the dead flying through the air, and the feast of the dead at Hallowe&#x27;en was likewise the festival of the fairies.&quot; Usually taking a crescent form, similar to a flight of grey birds, they were said to be able to approach and pick up a person from any direction and then transport them far away through the air, from one island to another. Although they would sometimes rescue humans from dangerous rock clefts, they were generally portrayed as dangerous to mortals.

==Etymology==
The Scottish Gaelic name stems from the Old Irish (≈ ), meaning &#x27;host, army; crowd, assembly&#x27;. Variant forms include and . It derives from the Proto-Celtic root * (cf. Gaul. &#x27;troops of combat&#x27;, Middle Welsh &#x27;troop&#x27;, Old Bret. - &#x27;army&#x27;), whose original meaning may have been &#x27;those serving the chief&#x27;, by comparing with Balto-Slavic words that probably emerged from early linguistic contacts with Celtic speakers in Central-Eastern Europe: e.g. Lithuanian (&#x27;service, servitude&#x27;), or Old Church Slavonic (&#x27;servant&#x27;).

==In popular culture==
In the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; video game series, Sluagh are among the enemies that Raziel encounters in the Spectral Realm. They are scavenging, animalistic creatures that prey on souls and usually prefer to flee from Raziel unless cornered or in a group. Raziel can easily weaken them into a transparent state in which he can devour them to replenish his own health.

Within the VR motion ride Battle for Eire at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, the Sluagh are the minions of the evil villain Balor in the ride&#x27;s story.

In the roleplay game &quot;Household&quot; by Two Little Mice the Slaughs are little peoples that lives in the Basement.

<text>A scientific instrument is a device or tool used for scientific purposes, including the study of both natural phenomena and theoretical research.

==History==
Historically, the definition of a scientific instrument has varied, based on usage, laws, and historical time period. Before the mid-nineteenth century such tools were referred to as &quot;natural philosophical&quot; or &quot;philosophical&quot; apparatus and instruments, and older tools from antiquity to the Middle Ages (such as the astrolabe and pendulum clock) defy a more modern definition of &quot;a tool developed to investigate nature qualitatively or quantitatively.&quot; Scientific instruments were made by instrument makers living near a center of learning or research, such as a university or research laboratory. Instrument makers designed, constructed, and refined instruments for purposes, but if demand was sufficient, an instrument would go into production as a commercial product.

In a description of the use of the eudiometer by Jan Ingenhousz to show photosynthesis, a biographer observed, &quot;The history of the use and evolution of this instrument helps to show that science is not just a theoretical endeavor but equally an activity grounded on an instrumental basis, which is a cocktail of instruments and techniques wrapped in a social setting within a community of practitioners. The eudiometer has been shown to be one of the elements in this mix that kept a whole community of researchers together, even while they were at odds about the significance and the proper use of the thing.&quot;

By World War II, the demand for improved analyses of wartime products such as medicines, fuels, and weaponized agents pushed instrumentation to new heights. Today, changes to instruments used in scientific endeavors — particularly analytical instruments — are occurring rapidly, with interconnections to computers and data management systems becoming increasingly necessary.

==Scope==
Scientific instruments vary greatly in size, shape, purpose, complication and complexity. They include relatively simple laboratory equipment like scales, rulers, chronometers, thermometers, etc. Other simple tools developed in the late 20th century or early 21st century are the Foldscope (an optical microscope), the SCALE(KAS Periodic Table), the MasSpec Pen (a pen that detects cancer), the glucose meter, etc. However, some scientific instruments can be quite large in size and significant in complexity, like particle colliders or radio-telescope antennas. Conversely, microscale and nanoscale technologies are advancing to the point where instrument sizes are shifting towards the tiny, including nanoscale surgical instruments, biological nanobots, and bioelectronics.

==The digital era==
Instruments are increasingly based upon integration with computers to improve and simplify control; enhance and extend instrumental functions, conditions, and parameter adjustments; and streamline data sampling, collection, resolution, analysis (both during and post-process), and storage and retrieval. Advanced instruments can be connected as a local area network (LAN) directly or via middleware and can be further integrated as part of an information management application such as a laboratory information management system (LIMS). Instrument connectivity can be furthered even more using internet of things (IoT) technologies, allowing for example laboratories separated by great distances to connect their instruments to a network that can be monitored from a workstation or mobile device elsewhere.

<text>Lorimar Television, formerly Lorimar Productions, Inc. and Lorimar Distribution, was an American production company that was later a subsidiary of Warner Bros., active from 1969 until 1993, when it was consolidated into Warner Bros. Television (now Warner Bros. Television Studios). It was founded by Irwin Molasky, Merv Adelson, and Lee Rich. The company&#x27;s name was a portmanteau of the name of Adelson&#x27;s then wife, Lori, and Palomar Airport.

== History ==
=== Early years and merger with Telepictures (1969–86) ===
In the late 1960s, Lorimar Productions was founded with the aid of a bank loan of $185,000 from Adelson. Prior to Lorimar, Rich had an established reputation first as an advertising executive at Benton &amp; Bowles, then as a television producer, co-producing (with Walter Mirisch) successful series such as &quot;The Rat Patrol&quot;.

Lorimar initially produced made-for-television movies for the &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot;. Rich bought the script to an adaptation of Earl Hamner Jr.&#x27;s novel &quot;The Homecoming&quot; and subsequently sold the rights to CBS. &quot;The Homecoming: A Christmas Story&quot;, airing during the 1971 holiday season, was a ratings success, and served as the pilot for Lorimar&#x27;s first major hit, &quot;The Waltons&quot;, which premiered in 1972. Throughout the 1970s, Lorimar produced a number of hit shows, including &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;; of these, the most popular by far was &quot;Dallas&quot;.

Lorimar&#x27;s operations gradually expanded, first with a syndication unit. In late 1978, Lorimar Productions and United Artists entered into a partnership; UA distributed Lorimar-produced films, while Lorimar sought to adapt UA properties into television series. However, nothing would come of the latter, and UA&#x27;s distribution deal with Lorimar ended in 1980. In 1980, Lorimar purchased the Allied Artists Pictures Corporation library.

In the 1984–85 season, three of the top 10 shows in the United States were produced by Lorimar; &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, and &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. In the mid-1980s, Lorimar&#x27;s output swung toward family-friendly sitcoms; among these were &quot;The Hogan Family&quot; (initially titled &quot;Valerie&quot;), &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, and &quot;Full House&quot;, which were produced by Miller-Boyett Productions. 1985 saw a concerted effort to expand into the lucrative field of first-run syndication with the acquisition of Syndivision, whose rights include syndication of &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot;, with ultimately-aborted plans to tape new episodes of the CBS game show &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;.

In October 1985, Lorimar, as part of their first-run syndication expansion, announced it would merge with television syndication firm Telepictures, becoming Lorimar-Telepictures. That same year Lorimar announced their intention to buy a 15% share in the then-financially troubled Warner Communications. On February 19, 1986, the Lorimar-Telepictures merger was completed and the company started trading on the New York Stock Exchange as &quot;LT&quot;. In 1986 they purchased the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio lot in Culver City, as well as the Metrocolor laboratory from Ted Turner. L-T turned around and sold off the Metrocolor facility to Technicolor for $60 million. Around that same year, Rich left the company and moved to MGM.

=== Purchase by Warner Communications and consolidation with Warner Bros. Television (1987–93) ===
In 1987, Lorimar-Telepictures&#x27;s production arm became Lorimar Television and the L-T distribution business was rebranded as Lorimar Syndication. This was part of a strategy where the Lorimar name would be used as an operating name for all of L-T&#x27;s business units. Plans were announced for a TV series based on &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine, but these plans did not come to fruition (&quot;TV Guide&quot; would come to television in 1999, when the Prevue Channel was rebranded as the TV Guide Channel).

In June 1988, Lorimar was purchased by Warner Communications, which in 1990 merged with Time Inc. to form Time Warner. Lorimar&#x27;s distribution business was folded into Warner Bros. Television Distribution and became Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution; since then, the Telepictures name has been resurrected as both a production company (circa 1990), and once again as a syndication company (1995).

The former MGM studio lot was sold to Sony to house Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, and Sony&#x27;s other operations towards the end of 1989 with the facilities renamed as Columbia Studios (now Sony Pictures Studios) at the beginning of 1990. In 1990, David Salzman left Lorimar to start Millennium Productions, an independent production company allied with WB. In 1991, after Orion Pictures shut down its television unit, Gary Nardino moved to Lorimar, taking some Orion-produced shows and talent deals (Thomas Carter, Robert Townsend, Paul Stojanovich, Clifton Campbell and Deborah Joy LeVine) with them. In 1992, Barbara Corday, former CBS executive, struck a deal with the studio.

Lorimar continued as a production company until September 1993, when it was eventually consolidated into Warner Bros. Television, primarily for economic reasons. The last series to premiere under the Lorimar name was &quot;Time Trax&quot;, as part of the Prime Time Entertainment Network programming block. Several shows slated to be Lorimar productions, such as &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, &quot;Living Single&quot;, &quot;It Had to Be You&quot;, &quot;Café Americain&quot;, &quot;The Trouble with Larry&quot; and &quot;Family Album&quot; ended up being produced by Warner Bros.

Les Moonves, who would later become the chairman and CEO of CBS Corporation, was the president and CEO of Lorimar Television from 1990 to 1993. Moonves then became the chairman of Warner Bros. Television after the merger with Lorimar.

Additionally, Lorimar owned key components of the film library of the defunct Allied Artists film studio (originally Monogram Pictures), which includes &quot;Cabaret&quot; and &quot;Papillon&quot;; these, too, are now owned by Warner. After the merger with Telepictures, they also took possession of the Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment animation house, along with the post-1973 library of that company, including its entry into the 1980s animation market, &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, which ran until 1989; a Warner Bros. Animation-produced revival show aired on Cartoon Network for one season in 2011.

== Other ventures ==
=== Theatrical films ===
Lorimar was not restricted to producing television programs. They also sporadically produced theatrical motion pictures, most of which were originally distributed by other studios; these were produced under the banner of Lorimar Motion Pictures (or sometimes Lorimar Pictures). Lorimar&#x27;s entrance into feature films was predominantly sanctioned by Adelson; Rich was vehemently against it. This asset was among the many factors that led to Rich&#x27;s exit from the studio in 1986.

Lorimar ended their original distribution pact with United Artists in 1980, soon after purchasing the Allied Artists library, due mainly to dissatisfaction with UA&#x27;s scattershot marketing of Lorimar productions. Subsequently, much of Lorimar&#x27;s film output was distributed by either Universal or Paramount domestically. By late 1984, the entire unit began to ramp up operations, including a deal with Sidney Lumet to develop feature films. In 1985, it entered into a partnership with Producers Sales Organization, handling worldwide sales, and 20th Century Fox, which took over North American distribution rights to many of its theatrical films. By 1986, Lorimar Motion Pictures had signed international distribution agreements with a joint venture of TCF and The Walt Disney Company called U.K. Film Distributors in the United Kingdom, France&#x27;s UGC and German&#x27;s Neue Constantin Film, along with Toho-Towa in Japan.

In January 1987, the film unit was renamed Lorimar Film Entertainment to coincide with its newly formed in-house distribution unit; this superseded the previous deal with Fox. That year, New Century/Vista Film Co., a joint venture of The Vista Organization and New Century Entertainment, struck a deal with Lorimar for international distribution. Several Vista productions were distributed by Lorimar, including &quot;Rented Lips&quot;, &quot;Pass the Ammo&quot; and &quot;Fright Night Part II&quot;. Lorimar also acquired international theatrical and other ancillary rights to &quot;Return of the Living Dead Part II&quot;.

In May 1987, Craig Bamgaurten, who had been with Lorimar Motion Pictures since 1984, announced that he would resign his post as president in December, and Peter Chernin took over as president of Lorimar Film Entertainment.

In 1988, following the announcement of L-T&#x27;s merger with Warner Communications, Lorimar struck a new distribution deal with Warner Bros. This deal effectively ended Lorimar&#x27;s in-house distribution wing; under Warner, Lorimar continued to make theatrical films until 1990. The theatrical film library of Lorimar was subsequently folded into Warner Bros. Pictures.

Warner Bros. now owns most of Lorimar&#x27;s catalogue, though a few films remained with their original distributors.

=== Home video ===
In 1984, Lorimar purchased Karl Video Corporation (KVC), the company behind the &quot;Jane Fonda&#x27;s Workout&quot; exercise video series. Lorimar continued to license library product (primarily Allied Artists titles) to CBS/Fox Video (as well as sub-labels Key Video and Playhouse Video) for some time.

After the Lorimar buyout, Karl-Lorimar began to expand, first with a deal to distribute movies from Lorimar Motion Pictures. Third-party distribution deals were struck with VCL Communications and De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, while laying groundwork for international expansion that saw Lorimar titles released in the UK through Guild Home Video and The Video Collection (the latter company handling children&#x27;s titles, including titles from the Scholastic-Lorimar Home Video venture).

In late 1986, a new broadcast-style home video branding, &quot;KLV-TV&quot; (advertised as being &quot;Your Personal Network&quot;) was introduced. Other areas of growth included Karl-Lorimar&#x27;s distribution of the &quot;Shades of Love&quot; direct-to-video romance series (in cooperation with Canada&#x27;s Astral Film Enterprises) and &quot;Jazzvisions&quot;, featuring jazz concerts from Herbie Hancock, Antonio Carlos Jobim, John Scofield, George Duke, Tito Puente and Etta James, as well as a big-band jazz production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.

By early 1987, while the company&#x27;s expansion (including a deal with international film distributor Cinecom Entertainment Group) continued, the relationship between Lorimar and Karl had turned sour, primarily thanks to the division racking up financial losses from failed experiments; as a result, Karl resigned in March 1987 due to violating the company&#x27;s ethical guidelines. Karl-Lorimar continued to exist under the name Lorimar Home Video, with a new push intended for Lorimar theatrical releases; however, this wouldn&#x27;t last long, as Lorimar Home Video closed in 1989 following the Warner merger, and was folded into Warner Home Video.

In Australia, Lorimar joined a venture with Village Roadshow to create Roadshow Lorimar Home Video, which distributed movie titles by Lorimar Motion Pictures in that country.

=== Television stations ===
=== Record label ===
In 1979, Lorimar formed Lorimar Records, whose first release was the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh&quot;. The label would have very few artists signed to it. It was mainly distributed by Columbia Records, but it was also distributed for one album from The Coyote Sisters by Motown via the Morocco subsidiary. Lorimar Records&#x27; final release was the soundtrack to &quot;Action Jackson&quot; (1988), which in that case was distributed by Atlantic Records.

=== Sports broadcasting ===
=== Advertising ===
Lorimar also expanded into advertising during the 1980s; it first acquired Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt, an advertising agency, in 1983. It then acquired Bozell Jacobs in 1985, and merged it with Kenyon to form Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt. The firm was renamed to Bozell Worldwide in 1992.

== Filmography ==
=== TV productions ===
Lorimar&#x27;s TV productions included:
=== Theatrical feature films ===
Most of Lorimar&#x27;s film and television library, with several exceptions, is now owned by Warner Bros. Several of Lorimar&#x27;s films are still owned by their original distributors or third parties, which are marked with an asterisk (*).

<text>A distributed control system (DCS) is a computerized control system for a process or plant usually with many control loops, in which autonomous controllers are distributed throughout the system, but there is no central operator supervisory control. This is in contrast to systems that use centralized controllers; either discrete controllers located at a central control room or within a central computer. The DCS concept increases reliability and reduces installation costs by localizing control functions near the process plant, with remote monitoring and supervision.

Distributed control systems first emerged in large, high value, safety critical process industries, and were attractive because the DCS manufacturer would supply both the local control level and central supervisory equipment as an integrated package, thus reducing design integration risk. Today the functionality of Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and DCS systems are very similar, but DCS tends to be used on large continuous process plants where high reliability and security is important, and the control room is not geographically remote. Many machine control systems exhibit similar properties as plant and process control systems do.

==Structure==

The key attribute of a DCS is its reliability due to the distribution of the control processing around nodes in the system. This mitigates a single processor failure. If a processor fails, it will only affect one section of the plant process, as opposed to a failure of a central computer which would affect the whole process. This distribution of computing power local to the field Input/Output (I/O) connection racks also ensures fast controller processing times by removing possible network and central processing delays.

The accompanying diagram is a general model which shows functional manufacturing levels using computerised control.

Referring to the diagram;

* Level 0 contains the field devices such as flow and temperature sensors, and final control elements, such as control valves
* Level 1 contains the industrialised Input/Output (I/O) modules, and their associated distributed electronic processors. 
* Level 2 contains the supervisory computers, which collect information from processor nodes on the system, and provide the operator control screens. 
* Level 3 is the production control level, which does not directly control the process, but is concerned with monitoring production and monitoring targets
* Level 4 is the production scheduling level.

Levels 1 and 2 are the functional levels of a traditional DCS, in which all equipment are part of an integrated system from a single manufacturer.

Levels 3 and 4 are not strictly process control in the traditional sense, but where production control and scheduling takes place.

===Technical points===

The processor nodes and operator graphical displays are connected over proprietary or industry standard networks, and network reliability is increased by dual redundancy cabling over diverse routes. This distributed topology also reduces the amount of field cabling by siting the I/O modules and their associated processors close to the process plant.

The processors receive information from input modules, process the information and decide control actions to be signalled by the output modules. The field inputs and outputs can be analog signals e.g. 4–20 mA DC current loop or two-state signals that switch either &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;, such as relay contacts or a semiconductor switch.

DCSs are connected to sensors and actuators and use setpoint control to control the flow of material through the plant. A typical application is a PID controller fed by a flow meter and using a control valve as the final control element. The DCS sends the setpoint required by the process to the controller which instructs a valve to operate so that the process reaches and stays at the desired setpoint. (see 4–20 mA schematic for example).

Large oil refineries and chemical plants have several thousand I/O points and employ very large DCS. Processes are not limited to fluidic flow through pipes, however, and can also include things like paper machines and their associated quality controls, variable speed drives and motor control centers, cement kilns, mining operations, ore processing facilities, and many others.

DCSs in very high reliability applications can have dual redundant processors with &quot;hot&quot; switch over on fault, to enhance the reliability of the control system.

Although 4–20 mA has been the main field signalling standard, modern DCS systems can also support fieldbus digital protocols, such as Foundation Fieldbus, profibus, HART, modbus, PC Link, etc.

Modern DCSs also support neural networks and fuzzy logic applications. Recent research focuses on the synthesis of optimal distributed controllers, which optimizes a certain H-infinity or the H 2 control criterion.

==Typical applications==
Distributed control systems (DCS) are dedicated systems used in manufacturing processes that are continuous or batch-oriented.

Processes where a DCS might be used include:

* Chemical plants
* Petrochemical (oil) and refineries 
* Pulp and paper mills (see also: quality control system QCS)
* Boiler controls and power plant systems
* Nuclear power plants
* Environmental control systems
* Water management systems
* Water treatment plants
* Sewage treatment plants
* Food and food processing
* Agrochemical and fertilizer
* Metal and mines
* Automobile manufacturing
* Metallurgical process plants
* Pharmaceutical manufacturing
* Sugar refining plants
* Agriculture applications

==History==


===Evolution of process control operations===
Process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages. Initially, control would be from panels local to the process plant. However this required a large amount of human oversight to attend to these dispersed panels, and there was no overall view of the process. The next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanently-staffed central control room. Effectively this was the centralisation of all the localised panels, with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the process. Often the controllers were behind the control room panels, and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant. However, whilst providing a central control focus, this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware, and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process.

With the coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control processors. These could be distributed around plant, and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms. The distributed control system was born.

The introduction of DCSs allowed easy interconnection and re-configuration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks, and easy interfacing with other production computer systems. It enabled sophisticated alarm handling, introduced automatic event logging, removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders, allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs, and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels.

===Origins===
Early minicomputers were used in the control of industrial processes since the beginning of the 1960s. The IBM 1800, for example, was an early computer that had input/output hardware to gather process signals in a plant for conversion from field contact levels (for digital points) and analog signals to the digital domain.

The first industrial control computer system was built 1959 at the Texaco Port Arthur, Texas, refinery with an RW-300 of the Ramo-Wooldridge Company.

In 1975, both Yamatake-Honeywell and Japanese electrical engineering firm Yokogawa introduced their own independently produced DCS&#x27;s - TDC 2000 and CENTUM systems, respectively. US-based Bristol also introduced their UCS 3000 universal controller in 1975. In 1978 Valmet introduced their own DCS system called Damatic (latest generation named Valmet DNA). In 1980, Bailey (now part of ABB) introduced the NETWORK 90 system, Fisher Controls (now part of Emerson Electric) introduced the PROVoX system, Fischer &amp; Porter Company (now also part of ABB) introduced DCI-4000 (DCI stands for Distributed Control Instrumentation).

The DCS largely came about due to the increased availability of microcomputers and the proliferation of microprocessors in the world of process control. Computers had already been applied to process automation for some time in the form of both direct digital control (DDC) and setpoint control. In the early 1970s Taylor Instrument Company, (now part of ABB) developed the 1010 system, Foxboro the FOX1 system, Fisher Controls the DC2 system and Bailey Controls the 1055 systems. All of these were DDC applications implemented within minicomputers (DEC PDP-11, Varian Data Machines, MODCOMP etc.) and connected to proprietary Input/Output hardware. Sophisticated (for the time) continuous as well as batch control was implemented in this way. A more conservative approach was setpoint control, where process computers supervised clusters of analog process controllers. A workstation provided visibility into the process using text and crude character graphics. Availability of a fully functional graphical user interface was a way away.

===Development===
Central to the DCS model was the inclusion of control function blocks. Function blocks evolved from early, more primitive DDC concepts of &quot;Table Driven&quot; software. One of the first embodiments of object-oriented software, function blocks were self-contained &quot;blocks&quot; of code that emulated analog hardware control components and performed tasks that were essential to process control, such as execution of PID algorithms. Function blocks continue to endure as the predominant method of control for DCS suppliers, and are supported by key technologies such as Foundation Fieldbus today.

Midac Systems, of Sydney, Australia, developed an objected-oriented distributed direct digital control system in 1982. The central system ran 11 microprocessors sharing tasks and common memory and connected to a serial communication network of distributed controllers each running two Z80s. The system was installed at the University of Melbourne.

Digital communication between distributed controllers, workstations and other computing elements (peer to peer access) was one of the primary advantages of the DCS. Attention was duly focused on the networks, which provided the all-important lines of communication that, for process applications, had to incorporate specific functions such as determinism and redundancy. As a result, many suppliers embraced the IEEE 802.4 networking standard. This decision set the stage for the wave of migrations necessary when information technology moved into process automation and IEEE 802.3 rather than IEEE 802.4 prevailed as the control LAN.

===The network-centric era of the 1980s===
In the 1980s, users began to look at DCSs as more than just basic process control. A very early example of a Direct Digital Control DCS was completed by the Australian business Midac in 1981–82 using R-Tec Australian designed hardware. The system installed at the University of Melbourne used a serial communications network, connecting campus buildings back to a control room &quot;front end&quot;. Each remote unit ran two Z80 microprocessors, while the front end ran eleven Z80s in a parallel processing configuration with paged common memory to share tasks and that could run up to 20,000 concurrent control objects.

It was believed that if openness could be achieved and greater amounts of data could be shared throughout the enterprise that even greater things could be achieved. The first attempts to increase the openness of DCSs resulted in the adoption of the predominant operating system of the day: &quot;UNIX&quot;. UNIX and its companion networking technology TCP-IP were developed by the US Department of Defense for openness, which was precisely the issue the process industries were looking to resolve.

As a result, suppliers also began to adopt Ethernet-based networks with their own proprietary protocol layers. The full TCP/IP standard was not implemented, but the use of Ethernet made it possible to implement the first instances of object management and global data access technology. The 1980s also witnessed the first PLCs integrated into the DCS infrastructure. Plant-wide historians also emerged to capitalize on the extended reach of automation systems. The first DCS supplier to adopt UNIX and Ethernet networking technologies was Foxboro, who introduced the I/A Series system in 1987.

===The application-centric era of the 1990s===
The drive toward openness in the 1980s gained momentum through the 1990s with the increased adoption of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and IT standards. Probably the biggest transition undertaken during this time was the move from the UNIX operating system to the Windows environment. While the realm of the real time operating system (RTOS) for control applications remains dominated by real time commercial variants of UNIX or proprietary operating systems, everything above real-time control has made the transition to Windows.

The introduction of Microsoft at the desktop and server layers resulted in the development of technologies such as OLE for process control (OPC), which is now a de facto industry connectivity standard. Internet technology also began to make its mark in automation and the world, with most DCS HMI supporting Internet connectivity. The 1990s were also known for the &quot;Fieldbus Wars&quot;, where rival organizations competed to define what would become the IEC fieldbus standard for digital communication with field instrumentation instead of 4–20 milliamp analog communications. The first fieldbus installations occurred in the 1990s. Towards the end of the decade, the technology began to develop significant momentum, with the market consolidated around Ethernet I/P, Foundation Fieldbus and Profibus PA for process automation applications. Some suppliers built new systems from the ground up to maximize functionality with fieldbus, such as Rockwell PlantPAx System, Honeywell with Experion &amp; Plantscape SCADA systems, ABB with System 800xA, Emerson Process Management with the Emerson Process Management DeltaV control system, Siemens with the SPPA-T3000 or Simatic PCS 7, Forbes Marshall with the Microcon+ control system and with the Harmonas-DEO system. Fieldbus technics have been used to integrate machine, drives, quality and condition monitoring applications to one DCS with Valmet DNA system.

The impact of COTS, however, was most pronounced at the hardware layer. For years, the primary business of DCS suppliers had been the supply of large amounts of hardware, particularly I/O and controllers. The initial proliferation of DCSs required the installation of prodigious amounts of this hardware, most of it manufactured from the bottom up by DCS suppliers. Standard computer components from manufacturers such as Intel and Motorola, however, made it cost prohibitive for DCS suppliers to continue making their own components, workstations, and networking hardware.

As the suppliers made the transition to COTS components, they also discovered that the hardware market was shrinking fast. COTS not only resulted in lower manufacturing costs for the supplier, but also steadily decreasing prices for the end users, who were also becoming increasingly vocal over what they perceived to be unduly high hardware costs. Some suppliers that were previously stronger in the PLC business, such as Rockwell Automation and Siemens, were able to leverage their expertise in manufacturing control hardware to enter the DCS marketplace with cost effective offerings, while the stability/scalability/reliability and functionality of these emerging systems are still improving. The traditional DCS suppliers introduced new generation DCS System based on the latest Communication and IEC Standards, which resulting in a trend of combining the traditional concepts/functionalities for PLC and DCS into a one for all solution—named &quot;Process Automation System&quot; (PAS). The gaps among the various systems remain at the areas such as: the database integrity, pre-engineering functionality, system maturity, communication transparency and reliability. While it is expected the cost ratio is relatively the same (the more powerful the systems are, the more expensive they will be), the reality of the automation business is often operating strategically case by case. The current next evolution step is called Collaborative Process Automation Systems.

To compound the issue, suppliers were also realizing that the hardware market was becoming saturated. The life cycle of hardware components such as I/O and wiring is also typically in the range of 15 to over 20 years, making for a challenging replacement market. Many of the older systems that were installed in the 1970s and 1980s are still in use today, and there is a considerable installed base of systems in the market that are approaching the end of their useful life. Developed industrial economies in North America, Europe, and Japan already had many thousands of DCSs installed, and with few if any new plants being built, the market for new hardware was shifting rapidly to smaller, albeit faster growing regions such as China, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.

Because of the shrinking hardware business, suppliers began to make the challenging transition from a hardware-based business model to one based on software and value-added services. It is a transition that is still being made today. The applications portfolio offered by suppliers expanded considerably in the &#x27;90s to include areas such as production management, model-based control, real-time optimization, plant asset management (PAM), Real-time performance management (RPM) tools, alarm management, and many others. To obtain the true value from these applications, however, often requires a considerable service content, which the suppliers also provide.

===Modern systems (2010 onwards)===
The latest developments in DCS include the following new technologies:

# Wireless systems and protocols 
# Remote transmission, logging and data historian
# Mobile interfaces and controls
# Embedded web-servers

Increasingly, and ironically, DCS are becoming centralised at plant level, with the ability to log into the remote equipment. This enables operator to control both at enterprise level ( macro ) and at the equipment level (micro), both within and outside the plant, because the importance of the physical location drops due to interconnectivity primarily thanks to wireless and remote access.

The more wireless protocols are developed and refined, the more they are included in DCS. DCS controllers are now often equipped with embedded servers and provide on-the-go web access. Whether DCS will lead Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) or borrow key elements from remains to be seen.

Many vendors provide the option of a mobile HMI, ready for both Android and iOS. With these interfaces, the threat of security breaches and possible damage to plant and process are now very real.

<text>An instant camera is a camera which uses self-developing film to create a chemically developed print shortly after taking the picture. Polaroid Corporation pioneered (and patented) consumer-friendly instant cameras and film, and were followed by various other manufacturers.

The invention of commercially viable instant cameras which were easy to use is generally credited to Edwin Land, the inventor of the model 95 Land Camera, widely considered the first commercial instant camera, in 1948, a year after he unveiled instant film in New York City.

In February 2008, Polaroid filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time and announced it would discontinue production of its instant films and cameras, shut down three manufacturing facilities, and lay off 450 workers. Sales of analog film by all makers dropped by at least 25% per year in the first decade of the 21st century. In 2009, Polaroid was acquired by PLR IP Holdings LLC, which uses the Polaroid brand to market various products often relating to instant cameras. Among the products it markets are a Polaroid branded Fuji Instax instant camera, and various digital cameras and portable printers.

, film continues to be made by Polaroid B.V. (previously the Impossible Project) for several models of Polaroid camera, and for the 8×10 inch format. Other brands such as Lomography, Leica, Fujifilm, and others have designed new models and features in their own takes on instant cameras.

==Cameras and film==

Many different models of Polaroid and non-Polaroid instant cameras were introduced in the mid to late 20th century. They can be categorized by the film type.

===Roll film===
The first roll film camera was the Polaroid Model 95, followed by subsequent models containing various new features. Roll film came in two rolls (positive/developing agent and negative) which were loaded into the camera and was eventually offered in three sizes (40, 30, and 20 series).

===Pack film===

The first 100 series pack film model was the model 100, followed by various models in the 100 - 400 series and a few ad hoc cameras such as the countdown series. The next generation of Polaroid cameras used 100 series &quot;pack film,&quot; where the photographer pulled the film out of the camera, then peeled apart the positive from the negative at the end of the developing process. Pack film initially was offered in a rectangular format (100 series), then in square format (80 series).

===Integral film===
Models which used SX-70 film were introduced in a folding version, with later versions being solid plastic bodied. Third generation Polaroids, like the once popular SX-70, used a square format integral film, in which all components of the film (negative, developer, fixer, etc.) were contained. The SX-70 instant camera used the print technology that Edwin Land had most desired. It introduced the use of more efficient print technology that developed more instantly than previous film types offered, which cut out some of the user&#x27;s responsibility and made it easier to use. Each exposure developed automatically once the shot was taken. SX-70 (or Time Zero) film had a strong following with artists who used it for image manipulation. 600 series cameras such as the Pronto, Sun 600, and One600 used 600 type film which was four times faster than SX-70 film. 600 series cameras were almost all plastic bodied, except for the SLR 680 and 690 models, which resembled SX-70 type cameras, but most came with an electronic flash.

===Spectra, Captiva, and i-Zone film===
This was followed by other various plastic cameras based on Spectra, Captiva, and i-Zone film. Polaroid Spectra cameras used Polaroid Spectra film which went back to a rectangular format. Captiva, Joycam, and Popshots (single use) cameras used a smaller 500 series film in rectangular format. i-Zone cameras use a very small film format which was offered in a sticker format. Finally, Mio cameras used Polaroid Mio film which was Fuji Instax mini, branded as Polaroid and which is still available in 2015 as Fuji Instax Mini. This size produces a billfold sized photo. Polaroid still markets a mini format camera built by Fuji branded as Polaroid 300 and the film is available with both the Polaroid name and as Fuji Instax mini which are interchangeable.

== Polaroid instant movie cameras ==

Polaroid also invented and manufactured an instant movie camera system called Polavision. The kit included a camera, film, and a movie viewer. When the movie was shot, it would be taken out of the camera and then inserted into the viewer for development, then viewed after development. This format was close to Super 8 mm film. Polavision film was different from normal film in that it was an additive film, mixing the primary colors (red, green, blue) to form the color image. The biggest disadvantage of the Polavision system was the low film speed (ASA 40), which resulted in having to use very bright lights when taking the movie, as well as requiring a special player to view the developed movie. It also lacked audio capability. Because of this, and combined with the advent of VHS video recorders, Polavision had a short history.

==Types of non-Polaroid instant cameras==

The earliest instant cameras were conceived before Edwin Land&#x27;s invention of the instant camera. These cameras were, however, more portable wet darkrooms than &quot;instant&quot; camera and were difficult to use.

After Land&#x27;s instant camera invention was brought to market in 1948, a few different instant cameras were developed, some using Polaroid-compatible film such as cameras by Keystone, Konica, and Minolta. Others were incompatible with Polaroid cameras and film, the most notable of these being made by Kodak, such as the EK series and Kodamatic cameras.

Later, Fujifilm introduced instant cameras and film in selected markets. After taking over an old Polaroid factory in 2008, the Netherlands-based Impossible Project began producing instant film for Polaroid cameras. This helped generate new interest in instant photography.

===Kodak (EK and Kodamatic) ===

Kodak&#x27;s EK and Kodamatic series cameras were introduced in 1976, and accepted a Kodak developed integral instant film, similar to but incompatible with Polaroid&#x27;s SX-70 film. The film was chemically similar to Polaroid&#x27;s with the exception that the negative was exposed from the rear and the dye/developers diffused to the front of the photograph. This alleviated the need for a mirror to reverse the image before it struck the negative.

Even so, Polaroid brought a patent-infringement lawsuit against Kodak, and eventually Kodak was forced to stop manufacture of both the camera and film. Kodak was also left to pay a settlement to some customers who were left without a way to use their now defunct cameras. One settlement offered owners of Kodak instant cameras a credit towards a new Kodak camera. Many Kodak instant cameras still exist and can be found on auction sites. Kodak also lost the contract to manufacture Polaroid&#x27;s negatives which subsequently took production in house. Recently photographers tried to use Instax mini and square film inside the Kodak EK4 being somewhat successful and only being able to load one picture at a time in a darkroom.
=== Fujifilm ===

In more recent years, Fujifilm introduced a line of instant cameras and film in Japanese and Asian markets. Fujifilm called their instant camera line Fotorama. Starting in the early 1980s the F series of cameras include the F-10, F-50S and F-62AF. In the mid-1980s it introduced the 800 series with models such as the MX800, 850E, and Mr Handy collapsible. The ACE cameras were introduced in the mid-1990s with film identical to the 800 film but with a different cartridge. The integral films are based on the Kodak line of instant camera films. The instant films FI-10/PI-800/ACE series are somewhat compatible with the Kodak line of instant cameras, with minor modifications to the cartridge to make it fit. The F series film was discontinued in 1994 but similar modifications on more recent Instax film can be made to fit in the older cartridges.

Fujifilm was one of the first manufacturers who added different shooting modes to Polaroid cameras. &quot;Kid mode&quot; for example, will shoot photos at a faster shutter speed for capturing fast moving objects or people. Fujifilm later introduced Instax Mini 8 and advertised as the &quot;cutest camera&quot; targeting young women and girls. Shortly after, they introduced Instax Mini 90 and Instax mini 70, Targeting middle-aged men with the new sleek and classic design. 

In the late 1990s Fujifilm introduced a new series of cameras using a new film called Instax it was available in markets outside the US. Instax became available in a smaller size with the introduction of the Instax Mini/Cheki line. Polaroid&#x27;s Mio was available in the US, it uses the same film as the Fujifilm Instax Mini series but were rebranded as Mio film. This was also true of the Polaroid 300, and this film is still being sold. None of Fujifilm&#x27;s products were sold officially in the United States originally. With the announcement in 2008 of Polaroid ceasing film production, Instax and peel apart type films became available in more channels. Fuji ended production of peel-apart films in 2016, FP-100C being the last such product from them.

===Polaroid Originals===
As noted above, Polaroid Originals (previously the Impossible Project) produces instant film for Polaroid cameras. In spring 2016, as Impossible Project they released their own instant camera, the Impossible I-1 that uses the company&#x27;s 600-type and I-Type films. In September 2017, now renamed Polaroid Originals, it announced the Polaroid OneStep 2 that also uses its 600-type and I-Type films.

===MiNT Camera===
In 2015, MiNT Camera released the InstantFlex TL70, a vintage twin-lens reflex-looking instant camera that used Fuji Instax Mini film.

In 2016, it launched the SLR670-S. It has the look of a Polaroid SX-70, but with an ISO 640 system and manual shutter options. These are built from vintage cameras with new electronics.

In 2019, it introduced the InstantKon RF70, a rangefinder camera that uses Fuji instax wide film. Two years later in 2021, it introduced another rangefinder camera, the InstantKon SF70, that uses Fuji instax square film.

===Lomography===
In 2014, Lomography funded the creation of a new instant camera, the Lomo&#x27;Instant, by raising over US $1,000,000 on Kickstarter. Like Fujifilm&#x27;s Instax Mini camera, the Lomo&#x27;Instant uses Instax Mini film.

The following year, the company released the Lomo&#x27;Instant Wide, a variation on the original Lomo&#x27;Instant which shot larger photos using Fujifilm&#x27;s Instax Wide film. These images are more similar in size to original Polaroid film.

In the summer of 2016, Lomography announced the development of a new instant camera. Called the Lomo&#x27;Instant Automat, Lomography describes it as &quot;the most advanced automatic instant camera.”

In August 2017, Lomography released the Lomo&#x27;Instant Square Glass. It takes 86mm x 72mm photographs and is the &quot;world&#x27;s first dual-format, glass lensed instant camera&quot;.

==Applications==
Instant cameras have found many uses throughout their history. The original purpose of instant cameras was motivated by Jennifer Land&#x27;s question to her father (Edwin Land): &quot;Why can&#x27;t I see them now?&quot; Many people have enjoyed seeing their photos shortly after taking them, allowing them to recompose or retake the photo if they didn&#x27;t get it right. But instant cameras were found to be useful for other purposes such as ID cards, passport photos, ultrasound photos, and other uses which required an instant photo. They were also used by police officers and fire investigators because of their ability to create an unalterable instant photo. Medium and large format professional photographers have also used the higher end instant cameras to preview lighting before taking the more expensive medium and/or large format photo. Instant film also has been used in ways that are similar to folk art, including the transfer of the images/emulsion and image manipulation.

Script supervisors in film production used instant cameras (until superseded by digital cameras) as standard to aid visual continuity by photographing actors, sets or props, to take photographs that could be instantly referred to when a particular set or character&#x27;s appearance needs to be reset and shot again, or recalled later due to reshoots or the out-of-sequence shooting schedule of a film or television production.

The fashion industry relied upon Polaroid prints as a record of models or potential models.

Instant photography was also useful in conducting a study about the perception of vehicle accidents. The instant photos were used to document accidents to show medical professionals the condition of a vehicle after an accident. Having this visual in turn changed how the physician viewed the accident their patient was in.

With the advent of digital photography, much of the instant camera&#x27;s consumer appeal has been transferred to digital cameras. Passport photo cameras have gone to digital, leaving instant cameras to a niche market.

Instant Cameras and Society

The introduction of instant camera technologies was important to society because it allowed for more creativity among camera users. Instead of having to use a darkroom to develop photographs, users were able to explore and document their world and experiences as they occurred. Instant Camera photography acted as an activity to some of its users. Instant cameras were portrayed by Polaroid as being able to combine the activities of both taking a photo and viewing one, into a singular past time.

Because instant cameras were easy to use, didn&#x27;t require a darkroom or sending out the film for processing, this allowed couples to take personal private photos without concerns about unwanted third parties viewing the photos.

==Taking an instant photograph==

Edwin Land&#x27;s original idea behind instant photography was to create a photographic system that was seamless and easy for anyone to use. The first roll film instant cameras required the photographer to use a light meter to take a reading of the light level, then to set the exposure setting on the lens. Then the lens was focused and the subject framed and the picture was taken. The photographer flipped a switch and pulled the large tab in the back of the camera to pull the negative over the positive, through some rollers to spread the developing agent. After the picture developed inside the camera for the required time, the photographer opened the small door in the camera back and peeled the positive from the negative. To prevent fading, the black and white positive had to be coated with a fixing agent, a potentially messy procedure which led to the development of coaterless instant pack film.

Pack film cameras were mostly equipped with automatic exposure, but still had to be focused and a flash bulb or cube unit needed to be used with colour film indoors. The development of the film required the photographer pull two tabs, the second tab which pulled the positive/negative &quot;sandwich&quot; from the camera, where it developed outside the camera. If the temperature was below 15 °C (60 °F), the positive/negative &quot;sandwich&quot; was placed between two aluminum plates and placed either in the user&#x27;s pocket or under their arm to keep it warm while developing. After the required development time (15 seconds to 2 minutes), the positive (with the latent image) was peeled apart from the negative.

Integral film cameras, such as the SX-70, 600 series, Spectra, and Captiva cameras went a long way in accomplishing Edwin Land&#x27;s goal of creating a seamless process in producing instant photos. The photographer simply pointed the camera at the subject, framed it and took the photo. The camera and film did the rest, including adjusting the exposure settings, taking care of focusing (Sonar autofocus models only), utilising a flash if necessary (600 series and up), and ejecting the film, which developed without intervention from the photographer. The new design of the frame film for the SX-70 cameras allowed for their convenient usage. With all of the ingredients necessary to develop the photograph in the thicker portion of the frame, the user only has to take the photo to initiate the reaction which provided them their photo.

== Creative techniques ==
Due to the way that instant film develops, several techniques to modify or distort the final image exist, which were utilized by many artists. The three main techniques used are SX-70 manipulation, emulsion lift, and image transfer. SX-70 manipulation is used with SX-70 Time Zero film and it allows the photographer to draw on or distort an image by applying pressure to it while it is developing. With an emulsion lift, it is possible to separate the image from the medium it developed on, and transfer it to a different one. Image transfers are used with peel-apart film, like packfilm, to develop the instant image into a different material by peeling the picture too early and adhering the negative onto the desired material. Polaroid encouraged the use of these techniques by producing videos about them.

The artist Lucas Samaras, for example, was among the first to modify the images taken with the Polaroid SX-70 through the &quot;Polaroid transfer&quot;. Thus, he developed the series &quot;autoentrevistas&quot;, a set of self-portraits in which he takes the place of a model in different circumstances.

John Reuter, the director of the Polaroid 20×24 camera studio, for years experimented with snapshot transfers.

Andy Warhol also made use of instant cameras. Warhol began taking snapshots to use as sketches of his popular lithographs. In spite of this, their peculiar vision and the passage of time have turned these Polaroids into famous and interesting photographs from an artistic point of view. They are also part of pop art or pop culture.

David Hockney also utilised polaroids within his work to create photo collages. Hockney was skeptical about photography, until instant photography was suggested to him by a museum curator. In the 1980s he began to experiment and creating composite photo collages. These include portraits, still lifes and the iconic swimming pools that Hockney is known for. He admitted that his works are very Cubist and often reference Synthetic Cubism with their distorted perspective. He later moved on from polaroids to 35mm film. 

== In popular culture ==
Polaroid pictures are used extensively in the movie Memento.

The popular 2003 song &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; by Outkast features the line &quot;Shake it like a Polaroid picture&quot;, referring to the myth that shaking an instant photo makes it dry faster. In reality, shaking has no positive effect and can even damage the photo. As a result of the song, the Polaroid Corporation released a statement discouraging the practice.

The name and app icon of the social photo sharing platform Instagram, founded in 2010, originated from the instant camera, with the 2010 icon directly resembling a Polaroid Land Camera 1000. 

Instant cameras featured prominently in the 2015 video game &quot;Life Is Strange&quot; in which the protagonist, Max Caulfield, frequently uses one.

In 2014, American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift used Polaroids as the aesthetic for her fifth studio album &quot;1989&quot;.

<doc id="274834" wikidata="Q151092" url="?curid=274834" title="Pin-up model">
<text>A pin-up model is a model whose mass-produced pictures and photographs have wide appeal within the popular culture of a society. Pin-up models are usually glamour, actresses, or fashion models whose pictures are intended for informal and aesthetic display, known for being pinned onto a wall. From the 1940s, pictures of pin-up girls were also known as cheesecake in the U.S. 

The term &quot;pin-up&quot; refers to drawings, paintings, and photographs of semi-nude women and was first attested to in English in 1941. Images of pin-up girls were published in magazines and newspapers. They were also displayed on postcards, lithographs, and calendars. The counterpart of the pin-up girl is the male pin-up, also known as &quot;beefcake&quot;, including celebrated actors and athletes such as the actor James Dean, the singer Jim Morrison, and the model Fabio.

==History==
From the early 19th century, when pin-up modeling had &quot;theatrical origins&quot;; burlesque performers and actresses sometimes used photographic business cards to advertise shows. These promotional and business cards could be found backstage in almost every theater&#x27;s green room, pinned up or placed in &quot;frames of the looking-glasses, in the joints of the gas-burners, and sometimes lying on top of the sacred cast-case itself.&quot; According to historian Maria Elena Buszek, &quot;To understand both the complicated identity and the subversive nature of the 19th-century actress, one must also understand that the era&#x27;s views on women&#x27;s potential were inextricably tied to their sexuality, which in turn was tied to their level of visibility in the public sphere: regardless of race, class or background, it was generally assumed that the more public the woman, the more &#x27;public,&#x27; or available, her sexuality.&quot; Famous actresses in early-20th-century film who were sexuality fantasized were both drawn, photographed and put on posters to be sold for personal use. Among the celebrities who were considered sex symbols, one of the most popular early pin-up girls was Betty Grable, whose poster was ubiquitous in the lockers of G.I.s during World War II.

In Europe, prior to the First World War, the likes of &quot;Miss Fernande&quot; (who some identify as Fernande Barrey) were arguably the world&#x27;s first pin-ups in the modern sense. Miss Fernande displayed ample cleavage and full frontal nudity, and her pictures were cherished by soldiers on both sides of the First World War conflict.

Other pin-ups were artwork that depicted idealized versions of beautiful or attractive women. An early example of the latter type was the Gibson Girl, a representation of the New Woman drawn by Charles Dana Gibson. &quot;Because the New Woman was symbolic of her new ideas about her sex, it was inevitable that she would also come to symbolize new ideas about sexuality.&quot; Unlike the photographed actresses and dancers generations earlier, art gave artists the freedom to draw women in many different ways. The 1932 Esquire &quot;men&#x27;s&quot; magazine featured many drawings and &quot;girlie&quot; cartoons but was most famous for its &quot;Vargas Girls&quot;. Prior to World War II, Vargas Girls were praised for their beauty and less focus was on their sexuality. However, during the war, the drawings transformed into women playing dress-up in military drag and drawn in seductive manners, like that of a child playing with a doll. Vargas Girls became so popular that from 1942 to 1946, owing to a high volume of military demand, &quot;9 million copies of the magazine-without adverts and free of charge was sent to American troops stationed overseas and in domestic bases.&quot; The Vargas Girls were adapted as nose art on many World War II bomber and fighter aircraft; generally, they were not seen negatively or as prostitutes, but mostly as inspiring female patriots that were helpful for good luck.

Among the other well-known American artists specializing in the field were Earle K. Bergey, Enoch Bolles, Gil Elvgren, George Petty, Rolf Armstrong, Zoë Mozert, Duane Bryers, and Art Frahm. Notable contemporary pin-up artists include Olivia De Berardinis, known for her pin-up art of Bettie Page and her pieces in &quot;Playboy&quot;.

==Feminism and the pin-up==
Maria Buszek the author of &quot;Pin-up Grrrls,&quot; said that the pin-up girl &quot;has presented women with models for expressing and finding pleasure in their sexual subjectivity&quot;.

According to Joanne Meyerowitz in &quot;Women, Cheesecake, and Borderline Material,&quot; an article in &quot;Journal of Women&#x27;s History&quot;, &quot;As sexual images of women multiplied in the popular culture, women participated actively in constructing arguments to endorse as well as protest [against] them.&quot;

As early as 1869, women have been supporters and opponents of the pin-up. Female supporters of early pin-up content considered these to be a &quot;positive post-Victorian rejection of bodily shame and a healthy respect for female beauty.&quot;

Additionally, pin-up allows for women to change their everyday culture. The models &quot;succeed in the feminist aim of changing the rigid, patriarchal terms.&quot;

It has been argued by some critics that in the early 20th century that these drawings of women helped define certain body images—such as being clean, healthy, and wholesome—and were enjoyed by both men and women, and that as time progressed, these images changed from respectable to illicit.

Conversely, female protesters argued that these images were corrupting societal morality and saw these public sexual displays of women as lowering the standards of womanhood, destroying their dignity, reducing them to mere objects to pleasure men and therefore harmful to both women and young adolescents.

Pin-up modeling has been described as a subculture that is invested in promoting positive body images and a love for one&#x27;s sexuality, &quot;pin-up would also find ways to... encourage the erotic self-awareness and self expression of real women&quot;.

== Hair and makeup style ==
The classic style of the pin-up originates back from the 1940s. Due to the shortages of materials during World War II, the period of makeup is considered the &quot;natural beauty&quot; look. The U.S. was immersed in war-time economy, which put distribution restrictions on consumer goods. General rationing was supported; women applied mild amounts of products.

Pin-up style makeup products consisted of:

* Foundation: A cream base, liquid foundation that matched their natural skin tone
* Compact powders: used to set the foundation and even the overall complexion
* Eyes and brows: neutral contour on brow bone and lid. Eyebrows were shaped but kept full
* Eyeliner: the wing effect became popular by the 1950s
* Lashes: extended the barriers of the eye to appear slightly larger
* Blush: pastel and rose colors applied to the apple of the cheek
* Lips: vibrant red and matte color, applied to look plumper.

In the 1950s, the overall look consisted of the red lip and was often paired with rosy cheeks. Eyeliner became bold and began to be more commonly used to make the eye appear larger. Natural eyebrows were embraced, as opposed to the thin brows of the 1920s and &#x27;30s. In the 1940s, brows were shaped and clean but filled in with a pencil to appear fuller.

Lipstick &quot;turned into a symbol of resilient femininity in the face of danger&quot; and was seen as a way to boost morale during the war. The shape of the lip was also iconic of the 1940s. The lips were painted on to look plumper; a broad outline of the lip was added for roundness. This fuller look is known as the &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Bow&quot;, invented by Max Factor.

The pin curl is a staple of the pin-up style, as &quot;women utilized pin curls for their main hair curling technique&quot;. Originating in the 1920s from the &quot;water-waving technique&quot;, the hair style of the 1940s consisted of a fuller, gentle curl. The drying technique consists of curling a damp piece of hair, from the end to the root and pin in place. Once the curl is dry, it is brushed through to create the desired soft curl, with a voluminous silhouette.

Victory rolls are also a distinctive hairstyle of the pin-up. The Victory roll is curled inward and swept off the face and pinned into place on the top of the head. Soft curls, achieved through the pin curl technique, finish the look of pin-up.

As a makeup style, the classic pin-up underwent a revival in modern fashion. The red lip and winged eyeliner made a re-emergence in 2010.

== Pin-up in the contemporary age ==
Although pin-up modeling is associated with World War II and the 1950s, it developed into a subculture which can be seen represented in the styles of some celebrities and public figures. Pamela Anderson was considered the &quot;perennial pin-up&quot; due to decades&#x27; worth of modeling for Hugh Hefner&#x27;s &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. The American singer Lana Del Rey, whose style is comparable to that of the classic pin-up model, has performed a song called &quot;Pin Up Galore&quot;. Beyoncé has recorded a song titled &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Love Me,&quot; which pays tribute to the American pin-up queen of the 1950s, Bettie Page. The American burlesque performer Dita Von Teese is often referred to as a modern pin-up due to her involvement in the revival of American Burlesque, known as Neo-burlesque. Von Teese made an appearance in a biographical film about Bettie Page, &quot;Bettie Page Reveals All&quot;, where she helps to define pin-up. Katy Perry makes use of the ideas associated with pin-up modeling, and has included these in music videos and costumes.The Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show can be comparable to burlesque show, whereas their yearly advent calendar can compare to pin-up in general.

The pin-up modeling subculture has produced magazines and forums dedicated to its community. &quot;Delicious Dolls&quot;, a magazine that began in 2011 has both a print and digital version. It was described in 2015 as &quot;the most-liked&quot; pin-up magazine in the world. One of the magazine&#x27;s mission statements is &quot;to promote and showcase retro and modern pin-up girls.&quot; Another well known modern pin-up magazine featuring pin-ups in vintage dress is &quot;Retro Lovely.&quot; This is the modern day pin-up magazine with the most sold digital and print copies. Within this subculture, there are opportunities to perform in pin-up contests, including one which takes place during the Viva Las Vegas rockabilly festival.

== African-American pin-up ==
Marilyn Monroe and Bettie Page are often cited as the classic pin-up, however there were many Black women who were considered to be impactful. In the 1920s the most notable black burlesque dancer was Josephine Baker. Dorothy Dandridge and Eartha Kitt were important to the pin-up style of their time by using their looks, fame, and personal success. African-American pin-up gained a platform when the magazine &quot;Jet&quot; (created in 1951) published material related to the African-American community. &quot;Jet&quot; supported pin-up with their full-page feature called &quot;Beauty of the Week&quot;, where African-American women posed in swimsuits. This was intended to showcase the beauty that African-American women possessed in a world where their skin color was under constant scrutiny. It was not until 1965 that Jennifer Jackson became the first African American to be published in &quot;Playboy&quot; as Playmate of the Month. 1990 marked the first year that &quot;Playboy&quot;″s Playmate of the Year was an African-American woman, Renee Tenison.

Some people believe there is a lack of representation in the media of Black women as pin-up models, even though they were just as influential to the construction of the style. 

Historically, Black women in pin-up are still not as common as White women pin-ups. However, the recent revival of pin-up style has propelled many Black women today to be interested and involved with. Making works based on the classic pin-up look to create their own standards of beauty. In Jim Linderman&#x27;s self-published book, &quot;Secret History of the Black Pin Up&quot;, he describes the lives and experiences of African-American pin-up models.

<text>Cranbrook Schools is a private PK–12 educational institution located on a campus in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. It includes a co-educational elementary school, a middle school with separate schools for boys and girls, and a co-educational college-preparatory high school with boarding facilities. Cranbrook Schools is part of the Cranbrook Educational Community (CEC), which includes the Cranbrook Institute of Science, the Cranbrook Academy of Art, and Cranbrook House and Gardens. Christ Church Cranbrook is also on campus. The Cranbrook community was established by publishing mogul George Booth, who bought the site of today&#x27;s Cranbrook community in 1904. Cranbrook was designated a National Historic Landmark on June 29, 1989, for its significant architecture and design. It attracts tourists from around the world. Approximately of Cranbrook Schools&#x27; campus are gardens.

As of 2023, Cranbrook Schools had an endowment of $217 million, among the fifteen largest held by America&#x27;s boarding schools. In addition, the Cranbrook Educational Community, of which the schools is a member, had an endowment in excess of $300 million in 2007.

 it had 1,656 students, making it Michigan&#x27;s largest private school by enrollment in a single campus.

==History of Cranbrook Schools==

In 1915, George and Ellen Booth opened a portion of their property to the general public with the construction of a small Greek Theatre. In 1918, the Booths built the Meeting House, which became the Bloomfield Hills School, opening for local children in 1922 (grades 1–12).

Subsequently, the Booths decided to build a middle school and a college preparatory school. Cranbrook School for Boys, which began operations in 1927, was designed by world-renowned Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen. Completed in 1928, it was Saarinen&#x27;s first executed architectural work in the United States. The name &quot;Cranbrook&quot; was chosen since Cranbrook, England was the birthplace of George Booth&#x27;s father. Kingswood School Cranbrook (for girls), also designed by Saarinen, opened in 1931. Cranbrook and Kingswood enrolled students from grades 7–12. The Bloomfield Hills School became an elementary school and was renamed Brookside School Cranbrook in 1930.

Unlike the Cranbrook School for Boys, which has several buildings, the Kingswood School has only one building, which includes supporting facilities. It houses dormitories, a dining hall, an auditorium, classrooms, lounge/common areas, a bowling alley, and a ballroom. The education at Kingswood School Cranbrook was initially primarily viewed as a &quot;finishing school&quot;. Today, Students take classes in English, History, Religion, and Art at Kingswood. The art classes available are Foundations in Design, Sculpture, Drawing, Weaving, Ceramics, Fashion Design, Painting, and Photography.

For the Booths and Saarinen, the conception and design of the Cranbrook and Kingswood schools were greatly influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, which began in 19th-century England.

In 1923, Booth founded an Episcopal church to serve the nascent Cranbrook community, as well as surrounding communities. He chose the firm of Goodhue Associates to design the church. Groundbreaking took place in 1925, and Christ Church Cranbrook was consecrated on September 29, 1928. Originally Cranbrook and Kingswood schools were affiliated with the Episcopal Church, but they have since secularized. However, special occasions are still celebrated at Christ Church Cranbrook.

Cranbrook School, Kingswood School, and Brookside School operated separately until 1970, when it was decided to govern them together. This was followed by the creation of the Cranbrook Educational Community. In 1985, Cranbrook and Kingswood schools were merged to create a co-educational upper school institution.

The middle school did not become co-educational; it was divided into gender-specific campuses in 1984. The Community acquired Vaughan School to house the boys&#x27; middle school. The basement of Kingswood was at one point the girls&#x27; middle school. A new Middle School building opened in 2010. For boys and girls of grades 6–8, all classes are separate. The exceptions are those for the performing arts (Symphonic Band, Orchestra).
Architecture critic Paul Goldberger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the Cranbrook campus &quot;one of the greatest campuses ever created anywhere&quot;.

==Cranbrook Schools today==
In 1985, Cranbrook School and Kingswood School were merged to create a coeducational upper school, the Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School. Classes are taught on both the original Cranbrook and Kingswood campuses.

Frequently, the school is referred to as &quot;CK&quot; by its students, faculty, and alumni. Cranbrook Kingswood now lays claim to 70 athletic teams; both men and women&#x27;s teams earned state championship titles in hockey, tennis, lacrosse, golf and swimming. As of 2011, there were 795 students, approximately one-third of which were boarding students who live in single-sex residence halls. Cranbrook Kingswood accepts slightly fewer than half of all applicants, placing it in the most selective 25% of preparatory schools in the United States.

Several programs offered at Cranbrook have won awards and recognition. The student newspaper &quot;The Crane-Clarion&quot; has been recognized by the Columbia Scholastic Press Association and the National Scholastic Press Association. In 2009, the Upper School&#x27;s student literary arts magazine, &quot;Gallimaufry&quot;, received a Gold Crown award from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association. The robotics and forensics team have also won several state and national awards. Their Model United Nations team has also been placed in the top 75 in North America as of Spring 2012.

Total enrollment at Cranbrook during 2007–08 was 1626, with 780 enrolled in the upper school, 333 in the middle schools, and 513 at the lower school Brookside. (Brookside&#x27;s numbers include children enrolled in pre-kindergarten, junior kindergarten, and kindergarten at the &quot;Vlasic Early Childhood Center&quot;, which opened in 1996.) Approximately 11% of Cranbrook Kingswood&#x27;s students are international students. Traditionally, Cranbrook School also has an exchange program with Cranbrook School, Kent, a boarding school in Cranbrook, Kent, England in honor of George Booth&#x27;s heritage.

===Summer programs===
During the summer months Cranbrook Schools conducts a variety of day and boarding programs on their campus. These include day camps, a soccer clinic, a filmmaking seminar, a compensatory educational program for students from low-income families, a jazz ensemble, ice hockey, lacrosse, and tennis camps as well as the &quot;Cranbrook Theater School&quot;. The actor Robert Englund taught one summer at the theater school.

=== Iconography ===
The Archer, the symbol of Cranbrook school, is based on an episode in () of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, by Virgil, line 519:
:&quot;...tamen aerias telum contendit in auras...&quot;
:...he aimed an arrow high into the breezes of the air...
In an archery contest, a bird is tethered to a cord, and there are four archers. The first three in turn miss, then hit the bird, while the fourth, Acestes, instead shoots his arrow into the air, where it bursts into flames. For this miracle, Acestes is declared the victor.

The design was chosen by William Oliver Stevens, the first headmaster of Cranbrook School, who sketched it. The actual logo was designed by Eero Saarinen.

===Traditions===
* Although Cranbrook School for Boys and Kingswood School Cranbrook merged in 1985 to become a single co-ed institution, the school reflects in many ways its history as separate, single-sex entities. (Alumni and alumnae who were enrolled prior to the merger consider themselves graduates of either Cranbrook or Kingswood.) Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School has two different hymns: The Cranbrook Song and the Kingswood Song, which are sung at many school events. Only the boys are invited to attend the Cranbrook Senior Pageant. Boys and girls have separate graduation ceremonies (although they do share in the same Baccalaureate service).
* Since 1971 sophomores have taken part in the &quot;Wilderness Expedition&quot;, a 10-day backpacking and wilderness camping trip in March that takes place in the Smoky Mountains along the North Carolina-Tennessee border
* Junior leadership ceremonies to celebrate the transition of the juniors to the senior class: A &quot;Junior Ring ceremony&quot; for girls and the &quot;Passage of Leadership ceremony&quot; for boys is held at Christ Church Cranbrook
* Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School maintains a dress code: Sweatpants are not allowed on any day except Friday, and on every Wednesday (the so-called Dress Day) boys have to wear a dress shirt with a tie and girls have to wear dresses or dressy tops with skirts or slacks.
* A convocation ceremony is held at the opening of the school year.

===Popular references===

* Eminem&#x27;s character, Rabbit, in the 2002 film &quot;8 Mile&quot; mentions Cranbrook in a rap battle with Papa Doc (portrayed by Anthony Mackie) when he questions Papa Doc&#x27;s &quot;gangsta&quot; act because he attended Cranbrook, which is a private school.
* The Cranbrook School is also the model for the preparatory school portrayed in Edmund White´s autobiographical novel &quot;A Boy&#x27;s Own Story&quot;.

<doc id="274836" wikidata="Q2291358" url="?curid=274836" title="Dominion Day">
<text>Dominion Day was a day commemorating the granting of certain countries Dominion status — that is, &quot;autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations&quot;. It was an official public holiday in Canada from 1879 to 1982, where it was celebrated on 1 July; that date is now known as Canada Day. In the Dominion of New Zealand, the anniversary of the granting of Dominion status, on 26 September, was observed as Dominion Day; it was never a public holiday.

==Canada==

Dominion Day () was the name of the holiday commemorating the formation of Canada as a Dominion on 1 July 1867. It became an official public holiday in 1879. Some Canadians were, by the early 1980s, informally referring to the holiday as &quot;Canada Day&quot;. Proponents argued that the name &quot;Dominion Day&quot; was a holdover from the British colonial era. The holiday was formally renamed to Canada Day in 1982 (via private member&#x27;s bill by MP Hal Herbert to amend the &quot;Holidays Act&quot;), the year the Constitution of Canada was patriated with the passing of the &quot;Canada Act&quot; by the British Parliament. Nonetheless, efforts to resurrect the original holiday name persisted for years, including a &quot;Bring Back Our Dominion Day&quot; campaign launched in the pages of a national newspaper.

==New Zealand==

A Dominion Day was occasionally celebrated in New Zealand to commemorate the anniversary of New Zealand becoming a Dominion on 26 September 1907. It was never a public holiday, although the first Dominion Day was a day off for public servants. The first Dominion Day was celebrated with a parade and other festivities in the capital, Wellington. Electric lights decorated Parliament Buildings, spelling out the words &quot;Advance New Zealand&quot;. In late morning, the Prime Minister, Sir Joseph Ward read the proclamation from the main steps of Parliament Buildings. Outside of the capital, there were popular military parades in cities such as Auckland. Other places &quot;declined the government’s invitation to be enthusiastic&quot;.

Dominion Day soon &quot;faded away as a public event&quot; – there were occasional celebrations in the first few years after 1907, mostly in Wellington, but they were mainly formal events that did not capture the attention of the public. There was no strong emotional attachment to the anniversary, because New Zealand&#x27;s granting of Dominion status passed largely unnoticed as a symbolic change. In 1907, the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot; called the day &quot;a finger-post in the history of this land, but it is no land-mark&quot;. New Zealand historian Keith Sinclair later remarked: &quot;… the change of title, for which there had been no demand, produced little public interest. It was largely regarded as Ward&#x27;s personal show … it was merely cosmetic&quot;.

Today, the Canterbury (South) anniversary day celebration is the fourth Monday in September, corresponding to Dominion Day; the holiday is otherwise unobserved in the rest of the country. There has been support in some quarters for the day to be revived as an alternative New Zealand Day, instead of renaming Waitangi Day, New Zealand&#x27;s current national day.

<text>The Cranbrook Educational Community is an education, research, and public museum complex in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. This National Historic Landmark was founded in the early 20th century by newspaper mogul George Gough Booth. It consists of Cranbrook Schools, Cranbrook Academy of Art, Cranbrook Art Museum, Cranbrook Institute of Science, and Cranbrook House and Gardens. The founders also built Christ Church Cranbrook as a focal point in order to serve the educational complex. However, the church is a separate entity under the Episcopal Diocese of Michigan. The sprawling campus began as a farm, purchased in 1904. The organization takes its name from Cranbrook, England, the birthplace of the founder&#x27;s father.

Cranbrook is renowned for its architecture in the Arts and Crafts and Art Deco styles. The chief architect was Eliel Saarinen while Albert Kahn was responsible for the Booth mansion. Sculptors Carl Milles and Marshall Fredericks also spent many years in residence at Cranbrook.

==Schools at Cranbrook==
Cranbrook Schools comprise a co-educational day and boarding college preparatory &quot;upper&quot; school, a middle school, and Brookside Lower School.

In 1922, the Bloomfield Hills School was the first school to open on the Cranbrook grounds. Founded by George Booth, the Bloomfield Hills School was intended as the community school for local area children. The Bloomfield Hills School ultimately evolved into Brookside School. Following completion of the Bloomfield Hills School, Booth looked forward to building Cranbrook School for Boys, an all-boys College-Preparatory school at which students from the Detroit area and abroad would come to reside. Booth wanted the Cranbrook School to possess an architecture reminiscent of the finest British boarding schools; he hired Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen to design the campus. Cranbrook&#x27;s initial phase of building was completed in 1928.
Over the years, the Cranbrook School for Boys campus grew to include Stevens Hall, Page Hall, and Coulter Hall. While primarily functioning as only residential spaces, Page Hall featured a smoking lounge as well as a shooting range. Lerchen Gymnasium, Keppel Gymnasium, and Thompson Oval were also constructed on the campus. In the 1960s, Cranbrook School for Boys also constructed a state-of-the-art Science Building named the Gordon Science Center.

Realizing that young women would also need a place of their own to learn, Ellen Scripps Booth, Booth&#x27;s wife, pressured Booth into building a school for girls. Scripps Booth supervised the project, which she named the Kingswood School Cranbrook. Unlike her husband, Scripps Booth encouraged Eliel Saarinen to come up with a unique interior design for the campus completely on his own. Instead of the several buildings that housed the Cranbrook School for Boys, the Kingswood School Cranbrook was contained within one building that included all necessary features, including dormitories, a dining hall, an auditorium, classrooms, a bowling alley, a ballroom, and lounges and common areas. The education at Kingswood School Cranbrook was initially viewed as a &quot;finishing school&quot;, though that changed over time.

In 1986, the Cranbrook School for Boys and Kingswood School Cranbrook entered a joint agreement, renaming the new institution the Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School.

==Cranbrook Academy of Art==
The Cranbrook Academy of Art, a graduate school for architecture, art, and design, was founded by George Booth and Ellen Scripps Booth in 1932. In 1984, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the effect of Cranbrook and its graduates and faculty on the physical environment of this country has been profound ... Cranbrook, surely more than any other institution, has a right to think of itself as synonymous with contemporary American design.&quot;

The buildings were designed and the school first headed by Eliel Saarinen, who integrated design practices and theories from the Arts and Crafts movement through the international style. The school continues to be known for its apprenticeship method of teaching, in which a small group of students—usually only 10 to 16 per class, or 150 students in total for the ten departments—study under a single artist-in-residence for the duration of their curriculum. There are no traditional courses; all learning is self-directed under the guidance and supervision of the respective artist-in-residence.

===Academics===
The school currently confers two degrees: Master of Fine Arts and Master of Architecture. The Master of Architecture degree is a post-professional degree and is not accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. Cranbrook Art Academy currently has 11 departments — 2D Design, 3D Design, 4D Design, Architecture, Ceramics, Fiber, Metalsmithing, Painting, Photography, Print Media and Sculpture. The latest department (4D Design) began taking students in the fall of 2019, under the leadership of Carla Diana, a Cranbrook Art Academy alumna. In 2022, Paul Sacaridiz was appointed the Director of the Cranbrook Academy of Art.

==Cranbrook Art Museum==

The Cranbrook Art Museum is a museum of contemporary art with a permanent collection, including works by Charles and Ray Eames, Harry Bertoia, Maija Grotell, Carl Milles, Robert Motherwell, Andy Warhol, and Roy Lichtenstein. Completed in 1942 under the direction of architect Eliel Saarinen, the museum is housed in the same building as the Cranbrook Academy of Art.

The museum also offers tours of Saarinen House, which has undergone painstaking restoration beginning in 1977. The remaining areas of the house were completed between 1988 and 1994. The museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.

Sculptor Carl Milles&#x27; numerous works in Metro Detroit include those at Cranbrook Educational Community, such as &quot;Mermaids &amp; Tritons Fountain&quot; (1930), &quot;Sven Hedin on a Camel&quot; (1932), &quot;Jonah and the Whale Fountain&quot; (1932), &quot;Orpheus Fountain&quot; (1936), and &quot;Spirit of Transportation&quot; (1952), currently in Cobo Center.

In 2009, the museum closed for renovation and expansion, reopening in November 2011. The project restored aspects of the original building designed by Saarinen, made necessary structural repairs, replaced windows, and upgraded mechanical systems. The renovated museum features year-round, changing exhibitions and a new Collections and Education Wing—an additional of storage and classroom space open to visitors by guided tour. Based on an open storage plan, the new wing allows the museum&#x27;s entire collection to be seen.

==Cranbrook Institute of Science==

The Cranbrook Institute of Science includes a permanent collection of scientific artifacts, as well as displays of annual temporary exhibits. It also features a planetarium and a powerful telescope through which visitors may peer on selected nights.

The museum grounds feature a life-sized statue of a &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;.

From 1946 to 1970, the institute awarded the Mary Soper Pope Medal for notable achievement in plant sciences.

==Cranbrook House and Gardens==

Cranbrook House and Gardens are the centerpiece of the Cranbrook Educational Community campus. The 1908 English Arts and Crafts-style house was designed by Albert Kahn for Cranbrook founders George Booth and Ellen Scripps Booth. Ten first-floor rooms can be seen on guided tours; the rooms contain tapestries, hand-carved woodworking, and English antiques in the Arts and Crafts style. The upper floors are used for the executive offices of the Cranbrook Educational Community.

Originally designed by George Booth, the gardens include a sunken garden, formal gardens, a bog garden, a herb garden, a wildflower garden, a Japanese garden, sculpture, fountains, specimen trees, and a lake.

Leonard Bernstein recalled composing portions of his Symphony No. 2, &quot;The Age of Anxiety&quot;, on the Cranbrook House Steinway concert grand piano while residing there in April 1946. Bernstein had come to Detroit at the request of Zoltan Sepeshy to conduct the Detroit Symphony Orchestra at Music Hall. While visiting, he requested studio space where he could compose, and Sepeshy had the piano moved from Cranbrook House into St. Dunstan&#x27;s Playhouse.

The house and gardens are open to the public from May through October.

==St. Dunstan&#x27;s Playhouse==
St. Dunstan&#x27;s Playhouse, while not formally a part of the Cranbrook Educational Community, is located on the Cranbrook grounds near the Cranbrook House. The Playhouse, a 206-seat theater, houses the St. Dunstan&#x27;s Theatre Guild of Cranbrook. The guild was founded in 1932 by Henry Scripps Booth, the son of Cranbrook&#x27;s founders George and Ellen Booth.

In the summer months, the St. Dunstan&#x27;s Theatre Guild performs in the outdoor Greek Theatre adjacent to the Cranbrook House. The theater was restored in 1990–1991.

==Historic landmark==
Fourteen buildings making up the Cranbrook complex were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and were further designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989, cited as being &quot;one of the most important groups of educational and architectural structures in America&quot;.

<doc id="274848" wikidata="Q153861" url="?curid=274848" title="Tularemia">
<text>Tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium &quot;Francisella tularensis&quot;. Symptoms may include fever, skin ulcers, and enlarged lymph nodes. Occasionally, a form that results in pneumonia or a throat infection may occur.
The bacterium is typically spread by ticks, deer flies, or contact with infected animals. It may also be spread by drinking contaminated water or breathing in contaminated dust. It does not spread directly between people. Diagnosis is by blood tests or cultures of the infected site.
Prevention is by using insect repellent, wearing long pants, rapidly removing ticks, and not disturbing dead animals. Treatment is typically with the antibiotic streptomycin. Gentamicin, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin may also be used.
Between the 1970s and 2015, around 200 cases were reported in the United States a year. Males are affected more often than females. It occurs most frequently in the young and the middle aged. In the United States, most cases occur in the summer. The disease is named after Tulare County, California, where the disease was discovered in 1911. A number of other animals, such as rabbits, may also be infected.

==Signs and symptoms==
Depending on the site of infection, tularemia has six characteristic clinical variants: ulceroglandular (the most common type representing 75% of all forms), glandular, oropharyngeal, pneumonic, oculoglandular, and typhoidal.

The incubation period for tularemia is 1 to 14 days; most human infections become apparent after three to five days. In most susceptible mammals, the clinical signs include fever, lethargy, loss of appetite, signs of sepsis, and possibly death. Nonhuman mammals rarely develop the skin lesions seen in people. Subclinical infections are common, and animals often develop specific antibodies to the organism. Fever is moderate or very high, and tularemia bacilli can be isolated from blood cultures at this stage. The face and eyes redden and become inflamed. Inflammation spreads to the lymph nodes, which enlarge and may (mimicking bubonic plague). Lymph node involvement is accompanied by a high fever.

==Cause==
Tularemia is caused by the bacteria &quot;Francisella tularensis&quot; which is typically spread by ticks, deer flies, and contact with infected animals.

===Bacteria===
The bacteria can penetrate into the body through damaged skin, mucous membranes, and inhalation. Humans are most often infected by tick/deer fly bite or through handling an infected animal. Ingesting infected water, soil, or food can also cause infection. Hunters are at a higher risk for this disease because of the potential of inhaling the bacteria during the skinning process. It has been contracted from inhaling particles from an infected rabbit ground up in a lawnmower (see below). Tularemia is not spread directly from person to person. Humans can also be infected through bioterrorism attempts.

&quot;Francisella tularensis&quot; can live both within and outside the cells of the animal it infects, meaning it is a facultative intracellular bacterium. It primarily infects macrophages, a type of white blood cell, and thus is able to evade the immune system. The course of disease involves the spread of the organism to multiple organ systems, including the lungs, liver, spleen, and lymphatic system. The course of disease is different depending on the route of exposure. Mortality in untreated (before the antibiotic era) patients has been as high as 50% in the pneumoniac and typhoidal forms of the disease, which however account for less than 10% of cases.

===Spread===
The most common way the disease is spread is via arthropod vectors. Ticks involved include &quot;Amblyomma&quot;, &quot;Dermacentor&quot;, &quot;Haemaphysalis&quot;, and &quot;Ixodes&quot;. Rodents, rabbits, and hares often serve as reservoir hosts, but waterborne infection accounts for 5–10% of all tularemia in the United States, including from aquatic animals such as seals. Tularemia can also be transmitted by biting flies, particularly the deer fly &quot;Chrysops discalis&quot;. Individual flies can remain infectious for 14 days and ticks for over two years. Tularemia may also be spread by direct contact with contaminated animals or material, by ingestion of poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water, or by inhalation of contaminated dust.

==Diagnosis==
===Pathology===
In lymph node biopsies, the typical histopathologic pattern is characterized by geographic areas of necrosis with neutrophils and necrotizing granulomas. The pattern is non specific and similar to other infectious lymphadenopathies.

The laboratorial isolation of &quot;F. tularensis&quot; requires special media such as buffered charcoal yeast extract agar. It cannot be isolated in the routine culture media because of the need for sulfhydryl group donors (such as cysteine). The microbiologist must be informed when tularemia is suspected not only to include the special media for appropriate isolation, but also to ensure that safety precautions are taken to avoid contamination of laboratory personnel. Serological tests (detection of antibodies in the serum of the patients) are available and widely used. Cross reactivity with &quot;Brucella&quot; can confuse interpretation of the results, so diagnosis should not rely only on serology. Molecular methods such as PCR are available in reference laboratories.

==Prevention==
There are no safe, available, approved vaccines against tularemia. However, vaccination research and development continues, with live attenuated vaccines being the most thoroughly researched and most likely candidate for approval. Sub-unit vaccine candidates, such as killed-whole cell vaccines, are also under investigation, however research has not reached a state of public use.

Optimal preventative practices include limiting direct exposure when handling potentially infected animals by wearing gloves and face masks (importantly when skinning deceased animals).

==Treatment==
If infection occurs or is suspected, treatment is generally with the antibiotics streptomycin or gentamicin. Doxycycline was previously used. Gentamicin may be easier to obtain than streptomycin. There is also tentative evidence to support the use of quinolone antibiotics.

== Prognosis ==
Since the discovery of antibiotics, the rate of death associated with tularemia has decreased from 60% to less than 4%.

==Epidemiology==
Tularemia is most common in the Northern Hemisphere, including North America and parts of Europe and Asia. It occurs between 30° and 71° north latitude.

In the United States, although records show that tularemia was never particularly common, incidence rates continued to drop over the course of the 20th century. Between 1990 and 2000, the rate dropped to less than 1 per one million, meaning the disease is extremely rare in the United States today.

In Europe, tularemia is generally rare, though outbreaks with hundreds of cases occur every few years in neighboring Finland and Sweden. In Sweden over a period from 1984 to 2012 a total of 4,830 cases of tularemia occurred (most of the infections were acquired within the country). About 1.86 cases per 100,000 persons occur each year with higher rates in those between 55 and 70.

===Outbreaks===
In the 14th century BC, a disease believed to probably be Tularemia spread throughout the Hittite Empire, known as the Hittite plague, and its use in repelling an invasion was the first in biological warfare recorded.

From May to October 2000, an outbreak of tularemia in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts, resulted in one fatality, and brought the interest of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a potential investigative ground for aerosolised &quot;Francisella tularensis&quot;. For a time, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard was identified as the only place in the world where documented cases of tularemia resulted from lawn mowing. However, in May 2015 a resident of Lafayette, Colorado, died from aerosolised &quot;F. tularensis&quot;, which was also connected to lawn mowing, highlighting this new vector of risk.

An outbreak of tularemia occurred in Kosovo in 1999–2000.

In 2004, three researchers at Boston Medical Center, in Massachusetts, were accidentally infected with &quot;F. tularensis&quot;, after apparently failing to follow safety procedures.

In 2005, small amounts of &quot;F. tularensis&quot; were detected in the National Mall area of Washington, D.C., the morning after an antiwar demonstration on September 24, 2005. Biohazard sensors were triggered at six locations surrounding the Mall. While thousands of people were potentially exposed, no infections were reported. The detected bacteria likely originated from a natural source, not from a bioterror attempt.

In 2005, an outbreak occurred in Germany amongst participants in a hare hunt. About 27 people came into contact with contaminated blood and meat after the hunt. Ten of the exposed, aged 11 to 73, developed tularemia. One of these died due to complications caused by chronic heart disease.

Tularemia is endemic in the Gori region of the Eurasian country of Georgia. The last outbreak was in 2006. The disease is also endemic on the uninhabited Pakri Islands off the northern coast of Estonia. Used for bombing practice by Soviet forces, chemical and bacteriological weapons may have been dropped on these islands.

In July 2007, an outbreak was reported in the Spanish autonomous region of Castile and León and traced to the plague of voles infesting the region. Another outbreak had taken place ten years before in the same area.

In January 2011, researchers searching for brucellosis among feral pig populations in Texas discovered widespread tularemia infection or evidence of past infection in feral hog populations of at least two Texas counties, even though tularemia is not normally associated with pigs at all. Precautions were recommended for those who hunt, dress, or prepare feral hogs. Since feral hogs roam over large distances, concern exists that tularemia may spread or already be present in feral hogs over a wide geographic area.

In November 2011, it was found in Tasmania. Reports claimed it to be the first in the Southern Hemisphere. However, the causative organism was documented to have been isolated from a foot wound in the Northern Territory in 2003.

In 2014, at least five cases of tularemia were reported in Colorado and at least three more cases in early 2015, including one death as a result of lawn mowing, as noted above. In the summer of 2015, a popular hiking area just north of Boulder was identified as a site of animal infection and signs were posted to warn hikers.

==History==

The tularemia bacterium was first isolated by G.W. McCoy of the United States Public Health Service plague lab and reported in 1912. Scientists determined tularemia could be dangerous to humans; a human being may catch the infection after contacting an infected animal. The ailment soon became associated with hunters, cooks and agricultural workers.

==Biological weapon==
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regard &quot;F. tularensis&quot; as a viable biological warfare agent, and it has been included in the biological warfare programs of the United States, Soviet Union and Japan at various times. A former Soviet biological weapons scientist, Ken Alibek, has alleged that an outbreak of tularemia among German soldiers shortly before the Battle of Stalingrad was due to the release of &quot;F. tularensis&quot; by Soviet forces. Others who have studied the pathogen &quot;propose that an outbreak resulting from natural causes is more likely&quot;. In the United States, practical research into using rabbit fever as a biological warfare agent took place in 1954 at Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas, an extension of the Fort Detrick program. It was viewed as an attractive agent because:
* it is easy to aerosolize
* it is highly infective; between 10 and 50 bacteria are sufficient to infect victims
* it is fast-acting: symptoms usually appear after three to five days. 
* it is nonpersistent and easy to decontaminate (unlike anthrax)
* it is highly incapacitating to infected persons
* it has comparatively low lethality, which is useful where enemy soldiers are in proximity to noncombatants, e.g. civilians

The Schu S4 strain was standardized as &quot;Agent UL&quot; for use in the United States M143 bursting spherical bomblet. It was a lethal biological warfare agent with an anticipated fatality rate of 40–60%. The rate-of-action was around three days, with a duration-of-action of one to three weeks (treated) and two to three months (untreated), with frequent relapses. UL was streptomycin resistant. The aerobiological stability of UL was a major concern, being sensitive to sunlight, and losing virulence over time after release. When the 425 strain was standardized as &quot;agent JT&quot; (an incapacitant rather than lethal agent), the Schu S4 strain&#x27;s symbol was changed again to SR.

Both wet and dry types of &quot;F. tularensis&quot; (identified by the codes TT and ZZ) were examined during the &quot;Red Cloud&quot; tests, which took place from November 1966 to February 1967 in the Tanana Valley, Alaska.

==Other animals==
Cats and dogs can acquire the disease from the bite of a tick or flea that has fed on an infected host, such as a rabbit or rodent. For treatment of infected cats, antibiotics are the preferred treatment, including tetracycline, chloramphenicol or streptomycin. Long treatment courses may be necessary as relapses are common.

<text>The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA ) is the principal public transport operator in the Atlanta metropolitan area. Formed in 1971 as strictly a bus system, MARTA operates a network of bus routes linked to a rapid transit system consisting of of rail track with 38 subway stations. MARTA&#x27;s rapid transit system is the eighth-largest rapid transit system in the United States by ridership.

MARTA operates almost exclusively in Fulton, Clayton, and DeKalb counties, although they maintain bus service to two destinations in neighboring Cobb County (Six Flags Over Georgia and the Cumberland Transfer Center next to the Cumberland Mall), while Doraville station serves portions of Gwinnett County via Ride Gwinnett buses. MARTA also operates Mobility, a separate paratransit service for disabled customers.

In , the entire system (bus and subway lines) had rides, or about per weekday in . 

MARTA&#x27;s first bus rapid transit (BRT) line is currently under construction. Construction is scheduled to be completed in 2025 with revenue service beginning in late 2025. The 5-mile line will run from downtown Atlanta, through Summerhill, and end at the Atlanta Beltline. The line, named the &quot;MARTA Rapid A Line&quot;, will utilize new 60-foot articulated electric buses. 

==History==
MARTA was originally proposed as a rapid transit agency for DeKalb, Fulton, Clayton, Gwinnett, and Cobb counties. These were the five original counties in the Atlanta metropolitan area, and to this day are the five largest counties in the region and state. MARTA was formed by an act of the Georgia General Assembly in 1965. In the same year, four of the five metropolitan area counties (Clayton, DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett) and the City of Atlanta passed a referendum authorizing participation in the system, but the referendum failed in Cobb.

Although a 1968 referendum to actually fund MARTA failed, in 1971, voters in Fulton and DeKalb counties successfully passed a 1% sales tax increase to pay for MARTA operations, while Clayton and Gwinnett counties overwhelmingly rejected the tax in the referendum. Gwinnett County remains outside of the MARTA system. In November 2014, however, Clayton County voters passed a 1% sales tax to join the MARTA system, reversing its 1971 decision. Also in 1971, the agency agreed to purchase the existing, bus-only Atlanta Transit Company; the sale of the company closed on February 17, 1972, giving the agency control over all public transit in the immediate Atlanta area.

Construction began on MARTA&#x27;s heavy rail system in 1975, with the first rail service commencing on June 30, 1979. The system has since built most of the proposed rail lines, as well as stations in Dunwoody, Sandy Springs, and North Springs, which were not included in the original plan. The missing rail segments from the original plan include a Tucker-North DeKalb line with service to Emory University and North Druid Hills, a Northwest line with service to Brookwood and Northside Drive, the extension of the West line to Brownlee-Boulder Park near Fairburn Road, the extension of the Proctor Creek line to West Highlands, and a branch off the south line to Hapeville and Clayton County.

Georgia State University was contracted to undergo archaeological excavations of rail construction areas in the late 1970s with the MARTA Archeology Project. Artifacts from the excavations are still housed at GSU.

===Previous expansion plans===
MARTA was built with at least three stubs for rail lines that were never built. The Northwest Line towards Cobb County has a stub tunnel east of Atlantic Station, but that redevelopment has not been built with a MARTA station in mind, and Cobb County would instead most likely get a light rail or commuter rail system (neither of which have been studied) or a bus rapid transit service (see Northwest Corridor HOV/BRT). The Northwest line was reduced to two planned stations but was later dropped entirely.

The South Line&#x27;s branch to Hapeville was considered for extension into Clayton County as far away as Forest Park, but this idea was also cut off when the voters of that county initially refused to approve tax funding for the line. Another idea for a rail spur line spur was for an above-ground line from near the International Airport for a spur line to the town of Hapeville, but no work has been initiated. The idea to revive expansion plans in the form of heavy rail and bus was approved to go once again before voters in November 2014 by the Clayton county commissioners in July 2014 with a 1% sales tax providing the funding for said expansion. This time, the referendum was approved and Clayton County voted to join MARTA, the system&#x27;s first ever expansion outside of Fulton, Dekalb and the city of Atlanta.

Yet another proposed spur line would have branched off the Blue Line in DeKalb County, Called the Tucker-North Dekalb Line it would have run northeast to the area of North Druid Hills, Emory University, and the town of Tucker. Now under consideration is an idea for light rail line (rather than heavy rail) from Avondale Station to Lindbergh Center, via Emory/CDC.

The Northeast Line of the rail system, which has ended in Doraville for two decades, was considered for extension into Gwinnett County as far as northeast as Norcross, Georgia, but this idea was cut off when the voters of that county declined to approve sales-tax funding for it.

The Proctor Creek branch was also projected to go one more station northwestward to the West Highlands neighborhood, but no work has been done on that one either.

Expansion westward to Fulton Industrial Boulevard through the use of either heavy rail extension or bus rapid transit has been proposed as an extension of the West Line since the system was originally planned.

The final three MARTA rail stations to be built, Dunwoody, Sandy Springs and North Springs - all north of the Interstate 285 Perimeter, were opened in 2000. The tracks to those stations were run on the surface of the median strip of Georgia 400, which was constructed just east of the Buckhead area as a tollway during the early 1990s. This is one of just two places at which the MARTA rail system extends outside of Interstate 285. The other is at the Indian Creek Station in eastern DeKalb County.

Since 2000, there have been no active railway expansion projects in the MARTA system due to lack of additional sales-tax funding, the need to spend its limited capital budget on refurbishing its older rolling stock, replacing the fare-collection system, repairing the tracks and their electrical systems, and other long-term maintenance, repair, and operations requirements.

====Mall at Stonecrest Expansion====
Eastward expansion focuses on bus rapid transit from downtown Atlanta along I-20 and extension of heavy rail transit from Indian Creek station, south along I-285 to I-20, then east along the I-20 corridor to the Mall at Stonecrest. The current Green Line would also be extended east from its current terminus at Edgewood/Candler Park station to Mall at Stonecrest. This proposed extension has not been studied further since 2018.

====Memorial Drive BRT====
Currently the only recent expansion in the entire MARTA system was the development of bus rapid transit along Memorial Drive from Kensington Station to the Goldsmith Road MARTA park and ride lot in Stone Mountain and Ponce De Leon Avenue. (Bus Service started operating on September 27, 2010). The bus had two routes: The Q Express runs between MARTA&#x27;s Kensington Station and a free 150-car Park-and-Ride lot at Goldsmith Road &amp; Memorial Drive; The Express only stops twice along the way at North Hairston Road and again at Georgia Perimeter College.

The Q Limited also ran north along Memorial Drive from Kensington Station but branched off at North Hairston Road on the way to East Ponce de Leon Avenue. The Q Limited had four stops along the way in addition the same stops for the Express The implementation of revenue-collecting service had initially been planned for early 2009.

Due to low ridership, BRT service was discontinued.

====Atlanta BeltLine====
Additionally, several traffic corridors are currently being studied by MARTA for possible system expansion. The BeltLine is a current proposal for the use of light rail and possibly bus or streetcar service on existing railroad rights-of-way around Atlanta&#x27;s central business districts. The conversion of existing rail right-of-way to the proposed BeltLine also calls for the creation of three additional MARTA rapid transit stations where existing lines intersect the Belt Line at Simpson Road, Hulsey Yard, and Murphy Crossing.

====Clifton Corridor====
Rapid transit alternatives are as of October 2011, under consideration for the Clifton Corridor, from Lindbergh Center, following the CSX rail corridor to Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control, with possible continuation along the northern edge of Decatur on to Avondale MARTA station. Bus, light rail and heavy rail rapid-transit options had been considered, with light rail being selected as the preferred option.

==== Connect 400 ====
The Georgia 400 Transit Initiative (also known as &quot;Connect 400&quot;) is a MARTA project to study options for expanding high-capacity transit along the Georgia State Route 400 corridor into the northern reaches of Fulton county. The initiative, kicked off in December 2011, envisages an 11.9-mile extension of rapid transit service, starting in the south at North Springs Transit Station, the current terminus of the existing MARTA Red Line. From there, such an extension would continue northward through the cities of Sandy Springs, Roswell, and Alpharetta, terminating in the vicinity of Windward Parkway.

As of the fifth public meeting on the subject on September 26, 2013, the study had narrowed the field of transit technology alternatives to three, all using existing right-of-way along SR 400: heavy-rail transit (HRT, extending the Red Line northward), light-rail transit (LRT), or bus rapid transit (BRT). Early designs for all three options include stations near Northridge Road, Holcomb Bridge Road, Mansell Road, North Point Mall, and Windward Parkway; initial sketches of the LRT and BRT options also include a station near Old Milton Parkway.

As of June 2015, the project is moving into the Environmental Impact study stage of the planning process. According to MARTA Representatives at the April 2015 meetings, the expansion could open in 2025 at the earliest assuming a best-case scenario. Federal funding is still not approved; the Environmental Impact study must be complete. By the April 2015 meeting, the LRT option has been discarded. The HRT option has been approved as the Locally Preferred Alternative, though two BRT options exist - one that would run in a dedicated bus guideway and the other to integrate with Georgia DOT&#x27;s planned work for the corridor. The GDOT integrated option would include sharing normal traffic lanes at least in some parts of the route. The plans for stations at Mansell Rd. and Haynes Bridge Rd. have been merged into one station at North Point Mall.

As of June 2018, the project&#x27;s adopted alternative is bus rapid transit (BRT) style bus service utilizing express lanes along new toll lanes. Heavy rail expansion will not be considered according to the signed House Bill (HB) 930.

====Proposed new infill stations====
Adding another station to the existing line near Armour Yard (MARTA&#x27;s main railyard, opened 2005) has also been discussed, as the Red and Gold MARTA lines, the northeast BeltLine light rail, proposed commuter rail lines to points northeast such as Athens (the &quot;Brain Train&quot;) and Gainesville, would all pass through Armour Yard. Other stations that have been proposed are; Mechanicsville, Boone, Murphy Crossing, and Krog.

The proposed Atlanta Multimodal Passenger Terminal (MMPT) would be built next to Five Points station, connecting MARTA to surface passenger rail, including commuter rail, future intercity rail, Amtrak, and possible high-speed rail in the Southeast Corridor.

Additional expansion plans for MARTA and other metro Atlanta transportation agencies are detailed in Mobility 2030 a timeline by the Atlanta Regional Commission for improving transit through the year 2030.

====Clayton County====
On July 5, 2014, the Clayton County Board of Commissioners, by a margin of 3-1 (Jeff Turner, Shana Rooks, and Sonna Gregory voting in favor,) approved a contract with MARTA to extend service to the county, financed by a 1 percent sales tax. Fulton and DeKalb county leaders approved the expansion. On November 4, 2014, Clayton County residents approved the 1% sales tax to join MARTA. Bus Service was implemented on March 21, 2015. The contract also includes provisions for future rail transit to the county by 2025.

One high-capacity/rail proposal calls for stations at Hapeville, Mountain View/ATL Hartsfield International Terminal, Forest Park, Fort Gillem, Clayton State/Morrow, Morrow/Southlake and Jonesboro by 2022. A station at Lovejoy is also proposed, which would open as a later phase. In 2018, commuter rail was selected as the locally preferred alternative of transit mode along the corridor.

As of 2021, this project is defunct and there are no plans to implement rail service in Clayton County. Additional bus service is proposed.

==== Gwinnett County ====
In September 2018, MARTA&#x27;s board of directors and the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners gave conditional approval to an agreement that would see MARTA assume, and significantly expand, operations of Gwinnett&#x27;s bus system (in operation since 2001) and clear the way for the long-sought-after extension of MARTA&#x27;s rail system into the county from its current terminus at Doraville. The population of Gwinnett County has significantly increased, and become more racially and ethnically diverse, since 1990, the last time the county rejected joining MARTA. Whereas white business elites were the initial demographic to support the MARTA in 1965, most black voters had voted to fund transit. Large communities of rural white Georgians opposed MARTA.

The original plan in 2018 includes a detailed multi-year plan to expand heavy rail rapid transit in Gwinnett County. Some aspects of the Connect Gwinnett plan will include a train that runs every ten minutes, and also get more buses to take people to the MARTA station. This was possible because Georgia Legislature permitted counties to raise taxes to fund transit, which before was not allowed. The contract with MARTA would go into effect only if a public vote, that was scheduled for March 19, 2019, succeeded. The agreement called for a new one-cent sales tax that would be collected in Gwinnett County until 2057. On March 19, 2019, the third transit referendum failed, with 54.32% of the vote being &quot;No&quot; to expand. A fourth transit referendum was added to the ballot during the 2020 presidential election, which failed by a margin of slightly more than 1,000 voters as 50.13% of voters chose to vote against the referendum.

==System==
MARTA is composed of a heavy rail rapid transit system, a light rail system, and a bus system, all of which operate primarily within the boundaries of Fulton, Clayton and DeKalb counties. In addition to Atlanta itself, the transit agency serves various suburbs within its service area, including Alpharetta, Avondale Estates, Brookhaven, Chamblee, Clarkston, College Park, Decatur, Doraville, Dunwoody, East Point, Ellenwood, Fairburn, Forest Park, Hapeville, Jonesboro, Lake City, Lovejoy, Lithonia, Morrow, Palmetto, Riverdale, Roswell, Sandy Springs, Stone Mountain, and Union City. MARTA also serves the airport via a station located next to the main terminal. Although Cobb County is not part of the MARTA system, the agency operates one limited bus route to the Cumberland Boulevard Transfer Center and another to Six Flags Over Georgia.

MARTA allows bicycles on its trains, and buses have room for two bicycles on racks mounted on the front of the bus. At the airport, bicycles can be locked up in all of the parking decks, so long as they are not obstructing either pedestrian or vehicular traffic.

In 2007, MARTA had 4,729 full and part-time employees, of whom 1,719 were bus drivers or train operators. Rail and bus operators, station agents, rail maintenance workers, and many other employees of MARTA are represented in negotiations by the Amalgamated Transit Union&#x27;s Local 732.

===Subway/Metro ===

MARTA&#x27;s rapid transit system has of route and 38 rail stations located on four lines: the Red Line (prior to October 2009, known as the North-South Line), Gold Line (former Northeast-South Line), Blue Line (former East-West Line), and Green Line (former Proctor Creek Line). The tracks for this system are a combination of elevated, ground-level, and subway tracks.

The deepest Subway station in the MARTA system is the Peachtree Center station, which is located in a hard-rock tunnel, beneath the city, where the highest hills in Atlanta are above sea level. No tunnel lining was installed in this station, or the adjacent tunnels. The architects and civil engineers decided to leave these with their rugged gneiss rock walls. The highest station in the MARTA system is the King Memorial station. It rises over a former CSX rail yard.

MARTA switched to a color-based identification system in October 2009. Formerly, the lines were named based upon their terminal stations, namely: Airport, Doraville, North Springs, H. E. Holmes, Bankhead, King Memorial, Candler Park, Indian Creek; or by their compass direction. During the transition between the two naming systems, all stations on the Red and Gold lines used their original orange signs, and all stations on the Blue and Green lines used their original blue signs.

All rapid transit lines have an ultimate nexus at the Five Points station, located in downtown Atlanta. MARTA trains are operated using the Automatic Train Control system, with one human operator per train to make announcements, operate doors, and to operate the trains manually in case of a control system malfunction or an emergency. Many of the suburban stations have free daily and paid long-term parking in park and ride lots. These stations also have designated Park and Ride passenger drop-off areas close to the stations&#x27; entrances.

===Streetcar===

The Atlanta Streetcar is a modern streetcar route that is powered by an overhead line and operates in mixed vehicle traffic. The system was constructed by the City of Atlanta and was integrated into MARTA operations on July 1, 2018. The streetcar operates on a pinched loop system in Downtown Atlanta.

====Rolling stock====

The Atlanta Streetcar system uses Siemens S70 light rail vehicles (LRVs). A total of four S70 cars were purchased and were built at two different facilities; the cars themselves were built in Sacramento, California while most other major components, like the propulsion system, were assembled at a plant about north of Atlanta, in Alpharetta. They were delivered in the first months of 2014 and are numbered 1001–1004.

===Bus===
MARTA&#x27;s bus system serves a wider area than the rail system, serving areas in Fulton, Clayton and DeKalb counties such as the cities of Roswell and Alpharetta in North Fulton, along with South DeKalb. MARTA bus service for Clayton County became effective March 21, 2015. As of 2010, MARTA has 554 diesel and compressed natural gas buses that covers over 110 bus routes that operated 25.9 million annual vehicle miles (41.7 million kilometers). MARTA has one bus route providing limited service in Cobb County (Route 12 has been extended to Cobb County&#x27;s Cumberland Boulevard Transfer Center). As of June 2016, MARTA purchased 18 New Flyer Industries Xcelsior XN60, which are primarily used on route 39 Buford Highway, the busiest bus route in the system. All of the MARTA bus lines, except for routes 142, 197 and 198, feed into or intersect MARTA rail lines as well. MARTA shuttle service is available to Six Flags Over Georgia during the park&#x27;s summer season.

In addition to the free parking adjacent to many rail stations, MARTA also operates five park and ride lots serviced only by bus routes (Windward Parkway, Mansell Road, Stone Mountain, Barge Road, and South Fulton).

====Route list====

===Paratransit===
In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), MARTA provides the Mobility paratransit service for those persons defined as disabled by the ADA. MARTA uses 211 special lift-equipped vehicles for this service, and can either deliver passengers to their final destination (curb-to-curb service) or can deliver the passenger to the closest accessible bus stop or rail station (feeder service). Mobility is limited to existing rail and bus routes and cannot extend more than a radius from any existing route. Mobility service is only provided during the hours of the fixed route servicing the area. An application for acceptance into the Mobility service is required; reservations are required for each trip. In fiscal year 2006, MARTA provided 289,258 Mobility trips.

The average cost to MARTA for providing a one-way trip for an individual Mobility passenger is US$31.88. This is much greater than the US$4.00 fare the Mobility rider is required to pay. The Americans with Disabilities Act forbids MARTA from charging a Mobility fare more than twice the normal fixed route fare.

A 2001 federal civil lawsuit, &quot;Martin v. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority&quot;, was brought by several disabled riders who alleged MARTA was violating the ADA by failing to provide: bus schedule and route information in an accessible format, buses with working wheelchair lifts, stop announcements on rail and bus routes, and adequate staff to schedule and provide on-time Mobility service. The district court ruled in 2002 that MARTA had violated the ADA and granted the plaintiffs an injunction requiring MARTA to improve service to the disabled.

== Future ==

=== Summerhill MARTA Rapid A Line (Bus rapid transit - 2025) ===
MARTA&#x27;s first bus rapid transit (BRT) line is currently under construction. Construction is scheduled to be completed in 2025 with revenue service beginning in late 2025. The 5-mile (8-kilometer) line will run from downtown Atlanta, through Summerhill, and end at the Atlanta Beltline. The line, named the &quot;MARTA Rapid A Line&quot;, will utilize new 60-foot (18-meter) articulated electric buses.

=== Infill stations ===
In March 2024, Mayor Andre Dickens announced that four new infill stations would be constructed across the network, including at Murphy Crossing – intersecting with the BeltLine – as well as at Krog Street, Joseph E. Boone, and Armour Yards. 
==Fare structure and operation==

Currently, the one-way full fare for MARTA costs US$2.50. New Breeze cards are $2. Breeze Tickets carry an extra fee of $1. Passengers over 65, passengers with disabilities and Medicare recipients are eligible to receive a discounted fare of $1. A one-way paratransit fare is $4. Ten full fare one-way trips can be purchased for $25, and twenty full fare trips can be purchased at a discount for $42.50. MARTA also offers unlimited travel through multiple transit pass options: 24-Hour pass $9, 2-day pass $14, 3-day pass $16, 4-day pass $19, 7-day pass $23.75, and a 30-day pass for $95. Additional discounted pass programs allow for university students and staff to purchase calendar monthly passes. Additional discounts are available to corporate partners who sell monthly MARTA passes to employees and also to groups and conventions visiting Atlanta. Some employers (at their own expense) also provide reduced cost or free MARTA passes to employees to encourage the use of public transportation. Children up to can ride for free with fare-paying rider; limit is 2.

Free shuttles also operate within the MARTA area, but are not part of MARTA. The Buckhead Uptown Connection (The BUC) goes around Buckhead, Atlanta&#x27;s uptown section and its third major business district behind downtown and midtown. This includes Lenox Square mall and the many high-rises and skyscrapers built along Peachtree Road. The Atlantic Station Shuttle offers service between the Arts Center MARTA Station and the Atlantic Station neighborhood of Midtown. Georgia Tech operates the Tech trolley between central campus, Technology Square, and the Midtown MARTA Station, as well as &quot;Stinger&quot; buses around its campus. Emory University operates &quot;The Cliff&quot; shuttle buses in and around its campus. The Clifton Corridor Transportation Management Association (CCTMA) operates a shuttle connecting Emory with downtown Decatur and the Decatur MARTA station.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, in March 2020 MARTA introduced free fares to bus rides, which ended early September 2020. The free fare modification did not apply to rail fares.

===Breeze Card===
MARTA finished implementing the &quot;Breeze&quot; smart card electronic fare collection system in September 2006, replacing the previous token-based fare collection system. The new Breeze Card allows riders to load money on the card for use over time, and to add unlimited day passes that are not fixed to a calendar period. The Breeze Card is for every passenger riding MARTA. The new Breeze fare gates are designed to help prevent fare evasion; with the older fare collection system fare evasion was much easier and was estimated to cost MARTA $10 million per year. Other connecting transit systems such as GRTA Xpress and CobbLinc also use the Breeze system.

MARTA stopped selling tokens after the Breeze conversion. Cards (without fare) were sent by mail for free to those who requested them when the system was first implemented.

To protect against hacking problems experienced by the then-current Breeze Card, MARTA rolled out a new Breeze Card in January 2016. The new card costs $2.

===Hours of operation===
MARTA operates every day. Rail service is provided from approximately 4:45 am to 1:00 am, Monday to Friday, and 6:00 am to 1:00 am on Saturday, Sunday &amp; most holidays. During certain events (New Year&#x27;s Eve) trains run until 2:00 a.m. (Trains also run all night during winter storms, though not in passenger service, to prevent ice from forming on non-underground lines.) On weekdays, trains run every 20 minutes on all rail lines from the beginning of service until 6:00 am. From 6:00 am-9:00 am and 3:00 pm-7:00 pm, trains run every 10 minutes on all rail lines. From 9:00 am-3:00 pm and 7:00 pm-8:30 pm, trains run every 12 minutes on all rail lines. From 8:30 pm until the end of service, trains run every 20 minutes on all rail lines. MARTA&#x27;s Red Line rail service only operates between North Springs and Lindbergh Center stations after 8:30 pm. MARTA&#x27;s Green Line rail service only operates between Bankhead and Vine City stations after 8:30 pm; Monday-Friday (with the exception of public holidays and track work performed by the authority). On weekends and public holidays, trains run every 20 minutes on all rail lines. Bus routes have varying frequencies dependent upon passenger demand.

===Fare reciprocity===
Through formal fare reciprocity agreements, MARTA riders are able to transfer for free to the three other metro-Atlanta transit systems: Ride Gwinnett, CobbLinc and GRTA Xpress. Some of these agreements require that neither system have significantly more transfers than the other. MARTA has stated that this is the case, that inbound (to MARTA from another system) and outbound (from MARTA to another system) transfers are approximately equal (for second quarter 2006, 8888 daily passengers transferred inbound and 8843 transferred outbound). Analysis of morning transfers (5 to 9 am) to MARTA shows that Cobb County had 718 inbound transfers but only 528 outbound, Gwinnett County had 239 inbound and 269 outbound, and GRTA Xpress had 1,175 inbound but 615 outbound. Some have suggested that more people from the other systems may benefit from free transfers than those living in the MARTA service area. It has also been noted that workers traveling in the morning to Atlanta from another system will more than likely make the return trip home, resulting in an equal number of transfers.

==Funding==

===Sales tax===
In addition to fare collections, the MARTA budget is funded by a 1% sales tax in Fulton, Clayton and DeKalb counties along with limited federal money. In 2017, the City of Atlanta raised their sales tax for MARTA to 1.5% to improve and expand MARTA. For fiscal year 2007, MARTA had a farebox recovery ratio of 31.8%. By law, funds from the 1% sales tax must be split evenly between MARTA&#x27;s operational and Capital expenditure budgets. This restriction does not apply to other sources of revenue, including passenger revenue. The split was written into MARTA legislation at MARTA&#x27;s formation with the rationale that MARTA should continue expanding and investing in the system. Nonetheless, MARTA has no active heavy rail construction projects. Capital funds continue to decrease every year, creating a shortfall. The operations funds limit the amount of service MARTA provides. The sales tax law was amended by the state legislature in 2002 to allow a temporary three-year 45% capital/55% operations split. This additional 5% for operations expired in 2005. A 2005 bill to renew the split was tabled by the legislature&#x27;s MARTA Oversight Committee, forcing MARTA to pass a new budget with cuts in service. The temporary 45%/55% capital/operations split was renewed again in the 2006 state legislative session. The capital funds surplus has resulted in projects, such as a new US$100 million Breeze Card fare collection system and US$1.1 million automatic toilets in the MARTA Five Points station, occurring at the same time that MARTA is struggling to pay for bus and rail operations. In 2015, the Georgia General Assembly approved a new bill that no longer requires MARTA to split the 1% Sales Tax. Due to low Sales Tax Revenue and no source of funding from the State of Georgia, MARTA was forced to eliminate 43 bus routes, eliminate shuttles, (Excluding the Six Flags Over Georgia and Braves Shuttle) and reduce Rail Service frequencies and hours. MARTA also closed the majority of its station restrooms. There are 13 station restrooms open to the public, most of which are located at the terminus of each line, and which include College Park, Arts Center, Peachtree Center, West End, Avondale, Kensington and Lindbergh Center. There are two Ridestores available, located at the Airport and Five Points Rail Stations. Despite the massive cuts, MARTA predicted the system would still come up 69.34 million dollars short for FY 2011, which was pulled from their Reserved Account. A $9 million addition was posted for 2013. This money was reinvested into the system by adding frequency to trains and bus routes.

The current 1% sales tax was set to be reduced to 0.5% in 2032. In early 2007 MARTA made a request to the City of Atlanta, DeKalb County, and Fulton County to seek a 15-year extension of the 1% sales tax from 2032 to 2047, with a 0.5% sales tax from 2047 to 2057. This is the fourth time in its history that MARTA sought the extension, the most recent in 1990. MARTA said the commitment to the tax is needed for the agency to secure long-term financing in the form of bonds to pay for any future expansions to the system. The resolution called for four new routes: bus rapid transit from H.E. Holmes station to Fulton Industrial Boulevard, bus rapid transit from Garnett station to Stonecrest Mall, transit for the BeltLine, and a direct transit link from Lindbergh Center to Emory University (formerly called the &quot;C-Loop&quot;). To approve the tax extension, two of the three government agencies needed to agree to the extension. In March 2007 the City of Atlanta voted 12–1 to approve the extension. In April 2007 the DeKalb County Commission also approved the sales tax extension. Some Fulton county officials opposed the sales tax extension on the basis that the proposed service expansions did not include previously proposed expansion of the North Rail line to Roswell and Alpharetta in North Fulton County.

===State funding controversy===
MARTA was formed through the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority Act of 1965, an act of the Georgia General Assembly. In addition to allowing the formation of the agency, and the collection of revenue from taxes, the legislation previously placed restrictions on how the agency managed its funds. In particular, the legislation established that any funds raised from the sale of bonds and capital goods would be spent on capital expenditures, and that any extra proceeds be put aside for paying off bond debt. While the enabling legislation put restrictions on how MARTA could manage its money, MARTA has never received any operational funding from the State of Georgia, making it the largest public transportation agency in the United States and the second-largest transit agency in Anglo-America (after the Toronto Transit Commission) not to receive state or provincial funding for operational expenses. The funding restrictions on MARTA were removed in 2015, with the passage of House Bill 213 by the General Assembly.

In early April 2009, MARTA experienced a budget crisis when the Georgia General Assembly failed to pass a bill that would allow MARTA to access its own capital reserve account, in order to compensate for a severe drop in sales-tax revenue during the late-2000s recession. MARTA stated that this could force the agency to discontinue operations one day out of the week, possibly a weekday. The agency&#x27;s budget crisis forced MARTA to lay off 700 employees. Service cuts and other budget-stabilizing measures began in fiscal year 2011, with the first affected service mark-up in September 2010. Governor Sonny Perdue refused to call a special session as requested, and did not issue an executive order as he stated it would not be legal to do so.

==Governance==
MARTA is a joint powers authority that is governed by a board of directors, consisting of representatives appointed from the city of Atlanta (3 members), and the remainder of the counties of Fulton (3 members), Clayton (2 members) and DeKalb (4 members). Additionally, there is 1 representative from the Georgia Department of Transportation, and 1 representative from Georgia Regional Transportation Authority who also serve as non-voting members.

Positions on the MARTA board are directly appointed by the organizations they represent. Although the state of Georgia does not contribute to MARTA&#x27;s operational funding, it still has voting members on the MARTA board. A similar situation existed for both Clayton and Gwinnett counties during most of MARTA&#x27;s history; as a consequence of passing the authorization referendum but not the funding referendum. Gwinnett County have representation on the MARTA Board of Directors without paying into the system. This situation became controversial in 2004 when Gwinnett&#x27;s representative Mychal Walker was found to have accepted US$20,000 from a lobbyist trying to secure a US$100 million contract with MARTA. Despite the controversy, as well as a MARTA board ruling that Walker violated the MARTA ethics policy, the Gwinnett County Commission initially failed to remove Mr. Walker from his position on the MARTA Board. Eventually, the state legislature was called upon to change the law governing MARTA&#x27;s Board to allow for the removal of a member whose appointing county did not act on a request for removal. Before the new law could be used, Mr. Walker was arrested on an unrelated child support violation, which resulted in his firing by the Gwinnett County Commission.

The highest position at MARTA is the general manager and chief executive officer. Below is a list of people that have held the position:
* MARTA&#x27;s General Manager was Richard McCrillis from 2006 to 2007. In October 2007, McCrillis retired after 22 years of service at MARTA.
* In October 2007, Dr. Beverly A. Scott was named the new general manager. Prior to joining MARTA, Dr. Scott served as GM/CEO of the Sacramento Regional Transit District. She has over 30 years of experience in the transportation industry. After 5 years at MARTA, she decided not to renew her contract with MARTA&#x27;s board of directors. Scott&#x27;s last day was December 9, 2012.
* Keith Parker was MARTA&#x27;s General Manager/CEO from December 9, 2012 – October 11, 2017.
* Jeffrey A. Parker served as MARTA&#x27;s General Manager/CEO position starting in 2017 until his death in 2022.
* Collie Greenwood assumed responsibilities as interim MARTA CEO on January 15, 2022. Prior to his role as interim CEO, Greenwood was MARTA&#x27;s deputy general manager for operations.

The Georgia General Assembly has a standing committee that is charged with financial oversight of the agency. During the 2009 legislative session, Representative Jill Chambers, the MARTOC chairperson at the time, introduced a bill that would place MARTA under GRTA, and permanently remove the requirement that MARTA split its expenditures 50/50 between capital and operations. This would allow MARTA to avoid service cuts at times when sales tax revenue is low due to recession, without having to ask the state legislature for temporary exemptions (typically a 55/45 split) as it has received before. The bill was not passed, but the funding restrictions were removed in 2015.

==Performance and safety==
During the 2005 fiscal year, MARTA had a customer satisfaction rate of 79%. On-time performance for rail service was 91.64%. The mean distance between rail service interruptions was and the mean distance between bus failures was .
MARTA has had two fatal accidents that resulted in a formal investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. On February 25, 2000, a train near Avondale station struck two automatic train control technicians who were inspecting a relay box; one was fatally injured and the other technician suffered serious injuries. The workers had failed to apply for a safe clearance restriction for the track work. In addition, the rail system center controller, who was aware of the workers, failed to notify train drivers of the technicians&#x27; presence. A second accident occurred on April 10, 2000, when a train struck a bucket lift containing two contract workers at Lenox station; the workers were fatally injured. Although the MARTA employee who was accompanying the workers notified the rail control center of the work over the track, the control center employee failed to block off the section of the track in the automated rail control system and also failed to notify the unscheduled southbound train of the workers&#x27; presence. In 2001 MARTA settled with the families of the two killed workers for US$10.5 million.

In addition to these accidents, MARTA trains have derailed five times in recent years. The most recent incident occurred in January 2019 when an out of service train derailed between Airport station and College Park station. The operator was not injured. A previous derailment occurred on December 4, 2006 Medical Center station when a train carrying passengers was moved over a rail switch. No injuries were reported. In July 1996 during Atlanta&#x27;s hosting of the Olympics, a paired car on a train that had developed mechanical problems was uncoupled from other cars at Indian Creek station (the last station on the east line). The train began rolling, crashing through the bumper at the end of the rail line and running off of the track. The train operator, the only person on board, received minor injuries. In June 1996 a minor derailment occurred at the junction between the North and Northeast lines; MARTA estimated 150 people were aboard. The derailment occurred when a rail supervisor told the train driver to reverse the train after realizing the train had gone the wrong way at a track split; a MARTA investigation of the incident showed the derailment caused $125,000 of damage to the train and track and caused injury to 16 passengers. And in August 1994 a minor derailment occurred at a switch between Candler Park and Inman Park. Approximately 20 passengers were on board and no one was injured.

On December 31, 2007, MARTA had three separate escalator accidents that injured at least 11 people. The incidents occurred as large crowds were going to the Chick-fil-A Bowl. Two escalators failed at Five Points station, and one escalator failed at Dome/GWCC/Philips Arena/CNN Center station. MARTA initially blamed the incidents on rowdy patrons jumping on the escalator. A subsequent formal investigation showed that the braking systems and a weak motor were to blame for the incidents.

In September 2008, a Fulton County jury awarded a woman $525,000 for injuries received in an accident at the Peachtree Center station. MARTA has been criticized for its escalator maintenance policies after recent injuries due to escalators overloading, but has discussed plans to improve its policies and regulate passenger loads with posted station agents.

==Criticism and concern==
Criticism of MARTA has originated from many different groups. Opponents of MARTA are critical of MARTA&#x27;s perceived inefficiency and alleged wasteful spending. Supporters of MARTA are critical of the almost complete lack of state and regional support of MARTA. In recent years, additional concerns have been raised regarding the reliability of service, as well as the governing structure of MARTA.

===Lack of regional financial support===
Since the formation of MARTA, the Georgia state government has never contributed to MARTA operational funding. Currently, MARTA is the largest mass transportation system in the United States not to receive state funding. Revenue from the Georgia motor fuel tax is currently restricted to roads and bridges and cannot be used for public transportation, further complicating potential sources of state funding for MARTA. In addition, the other largest two suburban counties (Gwinnett and Cobb counties) have refused to join or fund MARTA. Both Gwinnett and Clayton counties initially agreed to join MARTA but refused MARTA rail and bus service when voters in their respective counties voted against paying to help fund the system. Clayton County finally joined MARTA in November 2014. Gwinnett, along with Cobb County, created independent bus transit: Cobb Community Transit on July 10, 1989, Gwinnett County Transit on November 5, 2001. A separate regional bus transit service, Xpress, is operated by the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority in partnership with 11 metro Atlanta counties including Fulton and DeKalb, and began service on June 6, 2004.

The MARTA Board members are criticized for not being regular users of MARTA and thus are not actually aware of the concerns of MARTA commuters. Former CEO, Keith Parker, was known for commuting daily from Dunwoody to the headquarters using the Red Line.

Due to no funding from the state of Georgia and its limited funding from Fulton, Clayton and DeKalb counties, MARTA has struggled for many years to provide adequate service to the metropolitan area. As a result, MARTA has gained a notorious reputation throughout the metro Atlanta area for being ineffective and inconvenient. Many people who own cars avoid using the system altogether while residents in suburban areas usually drive their car to a MARTA rail station (instead of using bus service) if their job is near an adjacent one. MARTA&#x27;s financial structure (being tied to a 1% sales tax) has forced the agency to cut services during times of economic depression, further resulting in complaints about the inconvenience and inadequacy of MARTA services.

Although surrounding counties do not pay for MARTA, many of their residents use MARTA by driving directly to a MARTA station or by using a county or regional bus system that connects to MARTA. A license plate study from 1988 to 1997 showed that 44% of the cars parked in MARTA park-and-ride lots were from outside of Fulton and DeKalb counties. Current fare reciprocity agreements also allow non-paying counties to provide bus service for their residents that provide free connections to MARTA (see &quot;Fare reciprocity&quot;). According to a 2000 MARTA ridership study, 12% of MARTA riders live outside of MARTA&#x27;s service area.

===Effects of race on expansion and funding===
It is often argued that racial politics also play a role in the operation and future service planning for MARTA. Opponents of Georgia&#x27;s transportation policies have alleged a race-based two-tiered system, where billions are spent by the state on highway expansion to aid the automobile commutes of mostly white residents of the suburbs and rural areas (like GRIP), while service cuts at MARTA have hurt mostly black riders in low-income areas where residents cannot afford automobile ownership. Proponents contest that a portion of state funding for highways comes from the gasoline tax, a user fee analogous to the fare MARTA riders pay. Supporters of MARTA have alleged that the lack of participation by other metro Atlanta counties is rooted in racism and classism. In 1987, David Chesnut, then chairman of MARTA, stated, &quot;The development of a regional transit system in the Atlanta area is being held hostage to race, and I think it&#x27;s high time we admitted it and talked about it.&quot; As part of its Title VI plan, MARTA data revealed that in 2015, 75% of MARTA riders were black. The percentage of white riders is particularly low outside rush hours.

===Criminal activity===
Despite a strong safety record, throughout MARTA&#x27;s history there have been continued concerns regarding criminal activity on MARTA trains and in and around MARTA train stations. In the aftermath of a 1985 aggravated assault against the daughter of a Georgia State University professor, complaints were made that MARTA was underreporting its annual crime statistics. A 1986 review of the previous year&#x27;s records by MARTA&#x27;s audit office and the state legislature&#x27;s MARTA Oversight Committee (MARTOC) showed no deliberate underreporting of crime, but rather over-reporting of crime because MARTA included crimes not related to the rail line and did not adhere to the Uniform Crime Reporting system (reporting multiple crimes by the same person instead of only the most serious crime).

According to Federal Transit Administration records, MARTA&#x27;s crime statistics are in line with those of similar-sized systems, such as Bay Area Rapid Transit in the San Francisco Bay area. Nonetheless, high-profile crimes on or near MARTA have created the impression with some that MARTA is unsafe and lacks a strong police presence, even though it has its own police department. From 2005 to 2009, two homicides and one rape were reported on MARTA property. The most common crime reported was larceny. The most common area for crime was MARTA&#x27;s rail service, followed by MARTA&#x27;s parking lots. For fiscal year 2009, MARTA had a crime rate of 3.09 per 1 million riders, with 483 crimes reported during the entire year.

Suburban counties have opposed expanding MARTA on the basis that it would lead to increased crime, as well as the cost of expansion and the lack of perceived necessity to areas currently outside MARTA transit. It is alleged that because MARTA&#x27;s service area includes some of Atlanta&#x27;s most economically depressed and high-crime neighborhoods, expansion of MARTA would supposedly allow crime to spread to suburban areas. Then-MARTA-CEO, Dr. Scott, acknowledged that assumption and cites a study that did not find transit systems to nucleate crime. Other counterarguments often cite the case of the Washington Metro, which provides services in economically depressed areas with limited problems in suburban Washington D.C. stops.

===Reliability of service===

As is typical of rail transit in the United States, MARTA&#x27;s rail lines have two parallel tracks. Any train failure or track work results in shared use of the other track by trains going opposite directions, a situation known as single-tracking. There are no plans at this time to expand the number of tracks. MARTA is currently nearing the end of a complete replacement of tracks on all rail lines. Over the past few years, this replacement work has caused the agency to implement single-tracking on the weekends, which in turn has caused weekend patrons to experience less-frequent service.

In the summer of 2006, as a result of unusually high summertime temperatures, many MARTA rail cars became overheated, damaging on-board propulsion equipment. As a result, many trains broke down and had to be taken out of service for repair. This was further compounded by the fact that at any given time up to 50 older rail cars were out of service as part of MARTA&#x27;s rail car rehabilitation project. To compensate for the reduced number of operating rail cars, MARTA shortened trains from six to four cars in length. This sometimes resulted in almost half of the trains being shortened, creating crowded conditions for passengers.

===Misuse of funds by employees for personal expenses===
In 2006 internal and external audits of MARTA corporate spending revealed personal charges on a pair of MARTA credit cards used by former General Manager and CEO Nathaniel Ford and two of his secretaries. Ford&#x27;s charges included $454 at a golf pro shop, $335 in clothing from Men&#x27;s Wearhouse and a $58 visit to the dentist. In response to the 2006 audit, Ford sent MARTA a check for $1,000 as reimbursement for the charges. An additional credit card with charges involving two of his secretaries, Iris Anthony and Stephannie Smart, was also uncovered. Smart used the cards to pay approximately $6,000 in private expenses, and subsequently agreed to repay this amount to MARTA.

==Incidents==

On April 10, 2000, two MARTA contract workers repairing the ceiling of MARTA&#x27;s Lenox Station were killed when an unscheduled MARTA train struck the bucket of the self-propelled lift they were in. As a result, the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) audited MARTA operations and enforced changes to rule compliance by MARTA employees.

On October 15, 2011, 19-year-old Joetavius Stafford was killed by a MARTA police officer at the Vine City rail station. MARTA claims that Stafford was armed while his brother said he was unarmed. After a full investigation, there was evidence that Stafford was armed and the MPO was cleared.

In June 2018, a MARTA contractor died after being struck by a train while working on the tracks between Buckhead and North Springs stations.

On January 14, 2022, MARTA CEO Jeffrey Parker committed suicide by stepping in front of a moving train at the East Lake station.

<text>C++Builder is a rapid application development (RAD) environment for developing software in the C++ programming language. Originally developed by Borland, it is owned by Embarcadero Technologies, a subsidiary of Idera. C++Builder can compile apps for Windows (both IA-32 and x64), iOS, macOS, and Android (32-bit only). It includes tools that allow drag-and-drop visual development, making programming easier by incorporating a WYSIWYG graphical user interface builder.

C++Builder is the sibling product of Delphi, an IDE that uses the Object Pascal programming language. C++Builder combines the Visual Component Library (VCL) and IDE written in Object Pascal with multiple C++ compilers. C++Builder and Delphi can generate mutually compatible binaries. C++ methods can call Object Pascal methods and vice versa. Since both Delphi and C++ use the same back-end linker, the debugger can step from Delphi code into C++ transparently. In addition, C++Builder projects can include Delphi code. (The reverse is not possible.)

== Technology ==

C++Builder uses the same IDE as Delphi, and shares many core libraries. Notable shared Delphi (Object Pascal code) and C++ Builder routines include the FastMM4 memory manager, which was developed as a community effort within the FastCode project, the entire UI framework known as the VCL, which is written in Object Pascal, as well as base system routines, many of which have been optimised for both Delphi and C++Builder through the FastCode project.

C++Builder projects can include Delphi code. The Delphi compiler emits C++ headers, allowing C++ code to link to Delphi classes and methods as though they were written in C++. The reverse (C++ code being used by Delphi) is not as straightforward but possible.

C++Builder originally targeted only the Microsoft Windows platform. Later versions incorporated Borland CLX, a cross-platform development visual component library based on Qt, that supports Windows and Linux, however CLX is now abandoned. The current version by Embarcadero supports cross-platform development using the new Firemonkey (FMX) library.

== Editions ==

C++ Builder is available in four editions with increasing features and price:
*Community: Available for free for one year but has a limited commercial-use license. Includes local database connectivity and some library source code.
*Professional: Adds cross-platform compilation for macOS, (until version 10.2.2: iOS and Android requiring the purchase of the additional &quot;Mobile Add-On pack&quot;), more library source code, code formatting, and a full commercial license.
*Enterprise: Includes the mobile target platforms and adds client/server database connectivity, Enterprise Mobility Services, and DataSnap multi-tier SDK. 
*Architect: Adds data modeling tools.

==History==

Traditionally, the release cycle was such that Delphi got major enhancements first, with C++Builder following, though recent versions have been released at the same time as their Delphi equivalents.

=== 1.0 ===
Borland announced the preview version of C++Builder 1.0 on January 7, 1997. The company released a retail version on February 26, 1997, in three editions: &quot;Standard,&quot; &quot;Professional,&quot; and &quot;Client/Server Suite.&quot;

=== 3.0 ===
Borland skipped the 2.0 version number to align C++Builder with its Delphi version numbering.

=== 4.0 ===
New features include:
*Integrated Inprise Corporation&#x27;s VisiBroker 3.3 with event and naming services
*New multi-standard flexible C++ compiler
*Support for the latest ANSI/ISO C++ language specifications, including a host of compiler enhancements including Dynamic Compilation and Adaptive Compiler Technology (ACT), which radically speed compiler build processes; full ANSI/ISO template implementation; full ANSI/ISO STL (standard template library) support; and a high-performance 32-bit ANSI C++ native code compiler.
*Fully customizable AppBrowser IDE
*Latest support for Windows 98, 95, and NT including multiple monitors, common controls, docking forms and toolbars, and more.
*New Code and Parameter completion, and the new ClassExplorer live structured class view and member creation wizards.
*Exclusive C++ debugging tools, including remote debugging for distributed development (COM and CORBA); multi-process and cross-process debugging with debug inspectors, dynamic watch windows, and debug tooltips.
*Internet tools, including ActiveForms for building Web browser C++ applications and WebBroker for building CGI, WinCGI, ISAPI, and NSAPI C++ applications and over 25 Internet protocol components for instantly adding HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP, NNTP, HTML, and TCP/IP support to any C++ application.
*Multi-Tier Database Development Services (MIDAS) Development Kit, including MIDAS 2.
*Support for industry standards, including Oracle Corporation&#x27;s Oracle8i database server; Microsoft Corporation&#x27;s Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL), Microsoft SQL Server 7 and MTS (Microsoft Transaction Server); and Inprise Corporation&#x27;s Object Windows Library (OWL) and Visual Component Library (VCL).
*EZ-COM, which simplifies C++ COM client development and One-Step ActiveX Control creation with new Data Binding support.

=== 5.0 ===
On March 22, 2000, Inprise Corporation announced the release of Borland C++Builder 5, available in Enterprise, Professional, Standard editions. New features include:
*Support of Windows 2000.
*Internet Express

On Sep 15, 2003, Borland Software Corporation announced the release of &quot;Borland C++BuilderX&quot; (CBX), which was also included as part of the latest Borland Enterprise Studio for Mobile. CBX was written using the same framework as JBuilder and bore little resemblance to either C++Builder or Delphi. This product was aimed at developing large programs for enterprises, but did not sell well.

On Sep 22, 2003, Borland Software Corporation and PalmSource, Inc. announced Borland has licensed the PalmSource software development kits (SDKs) and will support Palm OS development in the Borland C++BuilderX Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and latest Borland Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) solutions for C++.

At the end of 2004 Borland announced that it would continue to develop the earlier C++Builder and bundle it with the Delphi development suite, abandoning C++BuilderX.

=== 2006 ===
On Oct 10, 2005, Borland announced the release of C++Builder 2006 (previously codenamed &quot;DeXter&quot;). Minimum supported operating system was changed to Windows 2000.

About a year after the announcement, the company released &quot;Borland Developer Studio 2006&quot;, which includes &quot;Borland C++Builder 2006&quot;, with improved configuration management and bug fixes. &quot;Borland Developer Studio 2006&quot; is a single package containing Delphi, C++Builder, and C#Builder.

=== 2007 ===
In 2006 Borland&#x27;s Developer Tools Group, developers of C++Builder, was transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary, CodeGear.

June 5, 2007, CodeGear released &quot;C++Builder 2007&quot;, providing:
* Full API support for Microsoft Windows Vista including themed applications and seamless VCL support for Aero and Vista Desktop
* Increased ANSI C++ conformance
* Up to 500% faster in-IDE build performance
* Support for MSBuild, DBX4 database architecture, and &quot;VCL for the Web&quot; which supports Ajax
* IDE, debugger, dbExpress, and VCL component improvements

&quot;CodeGear RAD Studio 2007&quot; incorporates &quot;C++Builder 2007&quot; and &quot;Delphi&quot;. Also in 2007 Borland revived the &quot;Turbo&quot; brand and released two &quot;Turbo&quot; editions of C++Builder: Turbo C++ Professional, and Turbo C++ Explorer (no longer available from CodeGear), based on &quot;Borland C++Builder 2006&quot;.

In 2008 CodeGear was purchased by Embarcadero Technologies, who continued development.

=== 2009 and 2010 ===
After purchasing CodeGear, Embarcadero Technologies bundled C++Builder with Delphi and other tools and released them as RAD Studio.

C++Builder 2009 was released on August 25, 2008, featuring:
* Full Unicode support throughout VCL and RTL
* Early adoption of the C++0x standard
* Full ITE (Integrated Translation Environment) support

<doc id="274869" wikidata="Q5474355" url="?curid=274869" title="Foundation Kit">
<text>The Foundation Kit, or just Foundation for short, is an Objective-C framework in the OpenStep specification described by NeXT Computer, Inc.. It provides basic classes such as wrapper classes and data structure classes. This framework uses the prefix NS (for NeXTSTEP). It is also part of Cocoa and of the Swift standard library.

==Classes==
===NSObject===
This class is the most common base class for Objective-C hierarchies and provides standard methods for working with objects by managing the memory associated with them and querying them.

===NSString and NSMutableString===
A class used for string manipulation, representing a Unicode string (most typically using UTF-16 as its internal format). NSString is immutable, and thus can only be initialized but not modified. NSMutableString is a modifiable version.

===NSValue and NSNumber===
NSValue is a wrapper class for C data types, and NSNumber is a wrapper class for C number data types such as int, double, and float. The data structures in Foundation Kit can only hold objects, not primitive types, so wrappers such as NSValue and NSNumber are used in those data structures.

===NSArray and NSMutableArray===
A dynamic array of objects, supporting constant-time indexing. NSArray is an immutable version that can only be initialized with objects but not modified. NSMutableArray may be modified by adding and removing objects.

===NSDictionary and NSMutableDictionary===
An associative data container of key-value pairs with unique keys. Searching and element addition and removal (in the case of NSMutableDictionary) is faster-than-linear. However, the order of the elements within the container is not guaranteed.

===NSSet and NSMutableSet===
An associative container of unique keys, similar to NSDictionary, with the difference that members do not contain a data object.

===NSData and NSMutableData===
A wrapper for raw byte data. An object of this type can dynamically allocate and manage its data, or it can refer to data owned by and managed by something else (such as a static numeric array).

===NSDate, NSTimeZone and NSCalendar===
Classes that store times and dates and represent calendrical information. They offer methods for calculating date and time differences. Together with NSLocale, they provide methods for displaying dates and times in many formats, and for adjusting times and dates based on location in the world.

==Major implementations==
===macOS and iOS ===
The Foundation Kit is part of the macOS Cocoa API. Beginning as the successor to OPENSTEP/Mach, this framework has deviated from OpenStep compliance, and is in some places incompatible. The Foundation Kit is in the iOS Cocoa Touch API. This framework is based on the macOS Cocoa.

===GNUstep===
The Foundation Kit is implemented in GNUstep&#x27;s Base Package (libs-base). This implementation is mostly comparable (4 classes are missing) and aims to be comparable with both the OpenStep API and later macOS additions. The missing classes have been dropped by Apple as well.

===Cocotron===
The Foundation Kit is implemented in Cocotron, an open-source implementation of Cocoa. It is also a part of Darling.

===PureFoundation===
PureFoundation is an open-source implementation of Foundation that implements Foundation by wrapping Core Foundation, just like in Cocoa, rather than create a separate Foundation from scratch like GNUstep and Cocotron.

===SwiftFoundation===
SwiftFoundation (swift-corelibs-foundation) is Apple&#x27;s open-source Swift implementation of the Foundation API for platforms where there is no Objective-C runtime. It also includes an implementation of Core Foundation.

===ApportableFoundation===
ApportableFoundation is an implementation of Foundation Kit (Foundation, CoreFoundation, and CFNetwork) based on Apple&#x27;s CFLite release. It works on Android and other Linux systems, and makes up part of the Darling macOS translation layer for Linux.

<text>The Visual Component Library (VCL) is a visual component-based object-oriented framework for developing the user interface of Microsoft Windows applications. It is written in Object Pascal.

== History ==
The VCL was developed by Borland for use in, and is tightly integrated with, its Delphi and C++Builder RAD tools.

In 1995 Borland released Delphi, its first release of an Object Pascal IDE and language. Up until that point, Borland&#x27;s Turbo Pascal for DOS and Windows was largely a procedural language, with minimal object-oriented features, and building UI frameworks with the language required using frameworks like Turbo Vision and Object Windows Library. OWL, a similar framework to MFC, required writing code to create UI objects.

A key aim of the VCL combined with the Delphi language was to change the requirements of building a user interface. (For context, the Delphi variant of Pascal had a number of innovative object-oriented features, such as properties and runtime type information, inspired by Modula and Smalltalk.) At the time, much UI code work required creating classes inheriting from other classes, and customized objects were often not reusable (for example, a button that performs a specific action cannot be reused in a different application.) UI code was also complicated, forcing the programmer to understand and use the Windows API, manage GDI resources, etc. Finally, a visual user interface arguably should be designed visually, and yet most tools to do so - at the time, mainly Visual Basic - did so in terms of the designer outputting code, creating a fragile, un-manually-editable situation - a problem that still persists today with many UI frameworks, particularly C++-based ones such as Qt.

The combination of the Delphi language and the VCL framework written in that language addressed these by:

* A streaming framework, allowing an object and subobjects to be streamed to text or binary format - TComponent, the root class of the VCL framework
* A form designer that saved to a stream, saving the description of the objects not the code required to create them, with objects capable of self-creation when streaming the description back in
* Language features that allowed instances of a class to be customised without subclassing, in two ways: first, through the use of properties, allowing instances of an object to have its own fields (such as a caption) easily changed through streaming; second, by allowing events - method pointers called at specific places in code - to be handled by another object; that is, the method pointers were attached to an object instance. In other words, this creates &quot;custom behaviours through delegation instead of inheritance&quot;.
* Controls that wrapped native Windows controls, in framework that managed resources
The combination of these resulted in a visual designer that streamed a description; a form (window) that constructed itself from that description, including creating all the other components on that form; and code being written in one place (methods on the form) that could be called by UI elements in response to certain actions, such as a button being clicked calling an OnClick event handler implemented in the form code. At the time this was revolutionary, while today it is an approach used by several other frameworks, such as WinForms and Cocoa.

This also allowed new components - new visual or non-visual classes - to be written easily. The VCL is Windows-based and its implementations of common controls are wrappers of the Windows API, thus is close to the ground and fully native. New controls can be implemented from scratch or can use existing Windows controls.

With the release of C++ Builder, the Delphi compiler could emit C++ header files for compiled Delphi-language units, and so the flexibility of the streaming, visually designed UI framework became available for C++. VCL components can in fact be written in C++, but ultimately inherit from Delphi ancestors, since the C++Builder compiler and linker can consume object and header files produced by Delphi. This was one of the first examples of cross-language compatibility, something unseen until .Net.

Today the VCL includes several hundred visual and non-visual components, usable in both the Delphi and C++ languages.

== Technology ==
VCL forms a class hierarchy with a common ancestor, the TComponent class (which inherits from TObject, the root class in Delphi Object Pascal). This is a common approach shared by the Java programming language, Smalltalk, C# and many other object-oriented programming languages.

VCL components cover Windows controls like windows (TForm class), controls (e.g., TButton, TCheckBox, TLabel classes) as well as database access (e.g., ADO or IBX components) or Internet connections (Indy components). The component approach allows programmers to extend the VCL with many visual and non-visual additional components. There is a large number of free and commercial component packages. Among them are JEDI, TMS, Developer Express, Mitov Software, Raize Software, TurboPower, IOComp, SDL, DA-SOFT Technologies and many others.

While not all VCL components are thread-safe, VCL supports multi-threading too. One example is the built in multi-threading support of the OpenWire VCL library.

VCL provides native support for PME (properties, methods and events) model at the .NET level.

Much of the .NET design, especially WinForms, is modeled after the VCL. One of the main architects of the first Delphi versions, Anders Hejlsberg, was hired by Microsoft and became one of the main architects of .NET. This became the subject of a lawsuit: at the time (1996), &quot;Borland alleged that Microsoft had hired 34 Borland employees over the past 30 months in order to steal Borland trade secrets. Borland also claimed that Microsoft offered and delivered expensive lures to Borland workers. In two cases, incentives topping $1 million were involved.&quot; According to delphi.about.com, the bonus was three million dollars in Anders&#x27; case. Many Delphi developers find C# quite familiar, due to the design similarities.

== Related frameworks ==
A cross-platform equivalent of the VCL, called CLX (Component Library for Cross Platform), was later developed for use in Delphi, C++Builder and Kylix in 2000–2001. However, it was abandoned.

A second cross-platform framework, FireMonkey, was integrated into Delphi and C++Builder XE2 in 2011. FireMonkey is a vector-based WPF-like framework for UIs on Windows, OSX, iOS and Android.

The Lazarus project has a portable (*nix, OS/X, Win32/64+wince) equivalent called LCL, which was already working when Kylix and CLX emerged. The project maintained its course and ignored Kylix (and later FMX).

OpenOffice.org and thus LibreOffice contain an unrelated graphic library called &quot;Visual Class Library&quot; (VCL).

<text>The Jewish aspiration to return to Zion, generally associated with divine redemption, has suffused Jewish religious thought since the destruction of the First Temple and the Babylonian exile.

==History (1881–1916)==

The first wave of modern Jewish migration to Ottoman-ruled Palestine, known as the First Aliyah, began in 1881, as Jews fled pogroms in Eastern Europe. Although the Zionist movement already existed in practice, Austro-Hungarian journalist Theodor Herzl is credited with founding political Zionism, a movement that sought to establish a Jewish state in the Land of Israel, thus offering a solution to the so-called Jewish question of the European states, in conformity with the goals and achievements of other national projects of the time.

In 1896, Theodor Herzl set out his vision of a Jewish state and homeland for the Jewish people in his book (&quot;The Jewish State&quot;). The following year he presided over the First Zionist Congress in Basel, at which the Zionist Organization was founded.

The draft of the objective of the modern Zionist movement submitted to the First Zionist Congress of the Zionist Organization in 1897 read: &quot;Zionism seeks to establish a home for the Jewish people in Palestine secured by law.&quot; One delegate sought to replace &quot;by law&quot; with &quot;by international law&quot;, which was opposed by others. A compromise formula was adopted, which came to be known as the Basel Program, and read:
:Zionism seeks to establish a home in Palestine for the Jewish people, secured under public law.

The Second Aliyah (1904–14) began after the Kishinev pogrom; some 40,000 Jews settled in Palestine, although nearly half of them left eventually. Both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly Orthodox Jews, although the Second Aliyah included socialist groups who established the &quot;kibbutz&quot; movement. Though the immigrants of the Second Aliyah largely sought to create communal agricultural settlements, the period saw the establishment of Tel Aviv as the first planned Jewish town in 1909. This period also saw the emergence of Jewish armed militias, the first being Bar-Giora, a guard founded in 1907. Two years later, the larger Hashomer organization was founded as its replacement.

The Sykes–Picot Agreement of 16 May 1916 set aside the region of Palestine for &quot;international administration&quot; under British control. The first official use of the phrase &quot;national home for the Jewish people&quot; was in the Balfour Declaration. The phrase &quot;national home&quot; was intentionally used instead of &quot;state&quot; because of opposition to the Zionist program within the British Cabinet. The initial draft of the declaration referred to the principle &quot;that Palestine should be reconstituted as the National Home of the Jewish people.&quot;

==History (1917–1948)==

With the 1917 Balfour Declaration, the United Kingdom became the first world power to endorse the establishment in Palestine of a &quot;national home for the Jewish people.&quot;

In 1919 Harry Sacher wrote &quot;A Jewish Palestine the Jewish case for a British trusteeship. In 1919 the general secretary (and future President) of the Zionist Organization, Nahum Sokolow, published a &quot;History of Zionism (1600–1918)&quot;. In this book, he explained:
&quot;... It has been said, and is still being obstinately repeated by anti-Zionists again and again, that Zionism aims at the creation of an independent &quot;Jewish State&quot;. But this is wholly fallacious. The &quot;Jewish State&quot; was never part of the Zionist programme. The &quot;Jewish State&quot; was the title of Herzl&#x27;s first pamphlet, which had the supreme merit of forcing people to think. This pamphlet was followed by the first Zionist Congress, which accepted the Basle programme—the only programme in existence.&quot;

At the San Remo conference of 19–26 April 1920, the principal Allied and Associated Powers mandated the creation of a Jewish homeland. Britain officially committed itself to the objective set out in the Balfour Declaration by insisting on its forming the basis of the Mandate for Palestine, which was formally approved by the League of Nations in June 1922. The preamble of the Mandate declared:
Whereas the Principal Allied Powers have also agreed that the Mandatory should be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally made on November 2nd, 1917, by the Government of His Britannic Majesty, and adopted by the said Powers, in favor of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country...

A statement on &quot;British Policy in Palestine,&quot; issued on 3 June 1922 by the Colonial Office, placed a restrictive construction upon the Balfour Declaration. The statement excluded &quot;the disappearance or subordination of the Arabic population, language or customs in Palestine&quot; or &quot;the imposition of Jewish nationality upon the inhabitants of Palestine as a whole&quot;, and made it clear that in the eyes of the mandatory Power, the Jewish National Home was to be founded in Palestine and not that Palestine as a whole was to be converted into a Jewish National Home. The Committee noted that the construction, which restricted considerably the scope of the National Home, was made prior to the confirmation of the Mandate by the Council of the League of Nations and was formally accepted at the time by the Executive of the Zionist Organization. The Partition Resolution of the UN General Assembly died at birth when rejected by the Arabs. The UNGA has only the power to recommend.

On 29 September 1923, the British government became responsible for the administration of Mandatory Palestine. Along with its longstanding control of the Persian Gulf Residency and the Aden Protectorate, and its recently-acquired control of the Emirate of Transjordan and of Mandatory Iraq, the British now controlled all of the territories in the Middle East except the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon.

In 1942, the Biltmore Program was adopted as the platform of the Zionist Organization, with an explicit call &quot;that Palestine be established as a Jewish Commonwealth.&quot; In 1946, the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry, also known as the Grady-Morrison Committee, noted that the demand for a Jewish State went beyond the obligations of either the Balfour Declaration or the Mandate and had been expressly disowned by the Chairman of the Jewish Agency as recently as 1932.

The period of the British Mandate was characterized by a great deal of political and social unrest among the Jews, the Palestinian Arabs, and the British (for example, the 1936–1939 Arab revolt, the 1944–1948 Jewish insurgency, and the 1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine).

The United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was passed on 29 November 1947. The plan was accepted by the Jewish Agency for Palestine but was rejected by the Arab Higher Committee and by most of the Arab population. The Arab League then adopted a series of resolutions endorsing a military solution to the conflict.

==Founding of the State of Israel==
The State of Israel was finally established on 14 May 1948 with the Israeli Declaration of Independence.

The concept of a national homeland for the Jewish people in the British Mandate of Palestine was enshrined in Israeli national policy and reflected in many of Israel&#x27;s public and national institutions. The concept was expressed in the Israeli Declaration of Independence on 14 May 1948 and given concrete expression in the Law of Return, passed by the Knesset on 5 July 1950, which declared: &quot;Every Jew has the right to come to this country as an oleh.&quot;

===Character of the State of Israel===

According to a 11 January 2019 article in &quot;Haaretz&quot;, Justice Esther Hayut, the President of the High Court of Justice, announced that eleven justices would be debating the &quot;legality&quot; of the July 2018 Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People, also known as the Nation-state law, including its &quot;historical stipulations&quot;.

<text>Component Library for Cross Platform (CLX) (pronounced clicks), is a cross-platform visual component-based framework for developing Microsoft Windows and Linux applications. It was developed by Borland for use in its Kylix, Delphi, and C++ Builder software development environment.

Its aim was to replace the popular Microsoft Foundation Classes with Visual Component Library (VCL). CLX was based on Qt by Nokia. The API of CLX almost completely followed VCL. It was envisioned that existing applications using VCL would be recompiled with CLX.

However, due to lackluster performance on Windows, subtle differences from VCL, and bugs, it did not become the expected successor to VCL. The commercial failure of Kylix stopped further development of CLX.

In terms of object-oriented approach, CLX forms an object hierarchy where the TObject class serves as the &quot;base class&quot;. All other classes inherit or indirectly inherit the TObject class.

Today, many concepts that were defined with CLX have been implemented with the Lazarus Component Library (LCL) for the Lazarus IDE. By docking to different widgetsets, the LCL is able to support an even larger spectrum of platforms including Mac OS X and Android.

<text>Ahmednagar, officially Ahilyanagar, is a city in, and the headquarters of, the Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra, India. Ahmednagar has several dozen buildings and sites from the Nizam Shahi period. Ahmednagar Fort, once considered almost impregnable, was used by the British to house Jawaharlal Nehru (the first prime minister of India) and other Indian Nationalists before Indian independence. A few rooms there have been converted to a museum. During his confinement by the British at Ahmednagar Fort in 1944, Nehru wrote the book &quot;The Discovery of India&quot;. Ahmednagar is home to the Indian Armoured Corps Centre &amp; School (ACC&amp;S), the Mechanised Infantry Regimental Centre (MIRC), the Vehicle Research and Development Establishment (VRDE) and the Controllerate of Quality Assurance Vehicles (CQAV). Training and recruitment for the Indian Army Armoured Corps takes place at the ACC&amp;S.

Ahmednagar is a relatively small town and shows less development than the nearby western Maharashtra cities of Mumbai and Pune. Ahmednagar is home to 19 sugar factories and is also the birthplace of the cooperative movement. Due to scarce rainfall, the city often suffers from drought. Marathi is the primary language for daily-life communication. The city administration has recently published a plan of developing the city by year 2031.

==Etymology==
Ahmednagar took its name from Ahmad Nizam Shah I, who founded the town in 1494 on the site of a battlefield where he won a battle against superior Bahamani forces. It was close to the site of the village of Bhingar. With the breakup of the Bahmani Sultanate, Ahmad established a new sultanate in Ahmednagar, also known as Nizam Shahi dynasty.

==History==
The town Ahmednagar was founded in 1494 by Ahmad Nizam Shah I on the site of a more ancient city, Bhingar. With the breakup of the Bahmani Sultanate, Ahmad established a new sultanate in Ahmednagar, also known as Nizam Shahi dynasty.

It was one of the Deccan sultanates, which lasted until its conquest by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 1636. Aurangzeb, the last Mughal emperor, who spent the latter years of his reign, 1681–1707, in the Deccan, died in Ahmednagar and is buried at Khuldabad, near Aurangabad in 1707, with a small monument marking the site.

In 1759, the Peshwa of the Marathas obtained possession of the place from Nizam of Hyderabad and in 1795 it was ceded by the Peshwa to the Maratha chief Daulat Rao Sindhia. In 1803 Ahmednagar was besieged by a British force under Richard Wellesley and captured. It was afterward restored to the Marathas but again came into the possession of the British in 1817, according to the terms of the Treaty of Poona, and was known as Ahmednuggur.

In 19th century American Christian missionaries opened first modern schools in this town. According to a report there were four girls&#x27; school running under the superintendence of Cynthia Farrar around the 1850s. Mahatma Jyotirao Phule visited them and got inspired to open school for girls in Poona. Later, he enrolled his wife Savitribai Phule in Farrar&#x27;s school in a teacher&#x27;s training program. Farrar was from America and spent his entire life in Ahmednagar running her schools, these girls&#x27; schools were one of the first such kind in the country.

During the First World War, Ahmednagar was the site of a camp for Prisoners of War, mainly for German and Austrian civilian internees and the captured crews of German ships, but also some Turkish soldiers captured in Mesopotamia.

On 31 May 2023, Eknath Shinde (the chief minister of Maharashtra) announced that Ahmednagar would be renamed &quot;Ahilya Nagar&quot;, in honour of Ahilyabai Holkar who was Rani of Indore, within the Maratha Confederacy in the late 18th-century. Deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis spoke at the same meeting, referring to Shinde&#x27;s government as &quot;pro-Hindutva&quot;, and asked Shinde to rename the district &quot;Ahilyanagar&quot;; Shinde replied: &quot;The state government has accepted your demand to rename Ahmednagar as Ahilyadevi Holkar Nagar&quot;. The BJP demanded that Ahmednagar be renamed. Rais Shaikh (group leader of the Samajwadi Party in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly) said that &quot;The Maha Yuti government is implementing the &#x27;Yogi pattern&#x27; of creating an illusion of development by changing the names of cities without doing anything for development&quot; and accused the government of &quot;distorting history&quot;. On 13 March 2024, the Maharashtra state cabinet announced that they had approved the renaming of Ahmednagar at the same time as they announced the renaming of seven railway stations in Mumbai. On 4 October 2024, the Maharashtra state government notified the state revenue and forest department of the change of name, who published this in the gazette on 8 October 2024.

<doc id="274890" wikidata="Q1757616" url="?curid=274890" title="List of Greek Orthodox patriarchs of Antioch">
<text>The patriarch of Antioch is one of the Eastern Orthodox patriarchs, the leader of the autocephalous Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch. The term &quot;Greek&quot; does not refer to ethnic origin; the majority of these patriarchs were not ethnic Greeks, but rather Hellenized Arabs, Arameans, Assyrians, and other Levantines who spoke Greek and adopted a Hellenic identity. It refers to the fact that this church follows the Chalcedonian Orthodoxy associated with the (Greek-speaking) Byzantine Empire. Since 518, there have been two patriarchs of Antioch who call themselves Orthodox: the Chalcedonian ones listed here, and the non-Chalcedonian Syriac Orthodox patriarchs of Antioch.

<doc id="274895" wikidata="Q1968664" url="?curid=274895" title="Sled dog racing">
<text>Sled dog racing (sometimes termed dog sled racing) is a winter dog sport most popular in the Arctic regions of the United States, Canada, Russia, Greenland and some European countries. It involves the timed competition of teams of sled dogs that pull a sled with the dog driver or &quot;musher&quot; standing on the runners. The team completing the marked course in the least time is judged the winner.

A sled dog race was a demonstration sport at the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, and again at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, and once more in the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, but it did not gain official event status.

Sled dogs, known also as sleighman dogs, sledge dogs, or sleddogs, are a highly trained dog type that are used to pull a dog sled, a wheel-less vehicle on runners, over snow or ice, by means of harnesses and lines.

==History==

The first recorded sled race in North America took place in 1908 in Alaska, the All Alaska Sweepstakes. It ran 400 miles through some of Alaska&#x27;s most arduous areas from Nome to Candle and back. The International Sled Dog Racing Association lists the winners of the first and the third races: &quot;The winning driver [the first] year was John Hegness, with a time of 119 hours, 15 minutes, and 12 seconds. By 1910, entries had increased considerably, as had the speed of the teams. The winner of [the third] race was John (Iron Man) Johnson, with an (as yet) unbroken record time of 74 hours, 14 minutes, and 37 seconds.&quot;

John Johnson ran a team of all Siberian Huskies, though he was not the owner of the dogs. The owner was a Scotsman named Charles Fox Maule Ramsay who had taken notice of the Siberian Huskies that had been used by a team in the 1909 race. His other teams, also led by Siberian Huskies, won both the second and fourth places in the race. Due to their small size and docile nature the breed had not been thought of as worthy competitors, but after that they dominated racing for a decade capturing some of the most prestigious Alaska racing titles, especially in rugged terrain where the breed was known for their endurance capability. Siberian Huskies were further popularized in 1925 when the city of Nome was stricken with a diphtheria epidemic and medical supplies were urgently needed. In what came to be known as the &quot;Great Race of Mercy&quot;, 20 mushers and 150 sled dogs transported the diphtheria antitoxin 674 miles across Alaska in a record-breaking five and a half days. The mushers and their dogs became instantly famous across the United States, especially the dog that lead the team on the final 55 mile stretch into Nome, a Siberian Husky named Balto.

==Races==
Sled dog races include &quot;sprint&quot; races over relatively short distances of 4 to 100 miles, mid-distance races from 100 to 300 miles, or long-distance races of 300 to over 1,000 miles (Iditarod). Sprint races frequently are two or three-day events with heats run on successive days with the same dogs over the same course. Mid-distance races are continuous events of 100 to 300 miles. (These categories are informal and may overlap to a certain extent.) Long-distance races may be continuous or stage races, in which participants run a different course each day, usually from a central staging location.
Races are categorized not only by distance, but by the maximum number of dogs allowed in each team. The most usual categories are four-dog, six-dog, eight-dog, ten-dog, and unlimited (also called open), although other team size categories can be found.

One example of a dog race is the American Dog Derby, which was first started in 1917. Competitors enter a 20, 40, 60 or 100-mile category. The race starts in Ashton, Idaho.
Races are organized either as &quot;timed starts,&quot; or &quot;mass start.&quot; In a timed start, teams start one after another in equal time intervals, competing against the clock rather than directly against one another. This simplifies some logistical considerations such as that of getting many teams of excited sled dogs to the starting line simultaneously. In mass starts, all of the dog teams start simultaneously. Mass starts are popular in Europe and many parts of Canada. Some mass start events can have up to 30 teams (300 dogs) start all at once.

Although some races are unsanctioned, held under the sole guidance of a local club, many races fall under one of three international organizations. In the United States and Canada, ISDRA (International Sled Dog Racing Association) sanctions many races. In Europe ESDRA (European Sled Dog Racing Association) provides sanctioning, and the IFSS (International Federation of Sleddog Sports) sanctions World Cup races all over the world, as well as a world championship race every two years.

For the race to be sanctioned, a variety of rules must be followed. For example, the ISDRA sanctioning rules specify that all hazards must be avoided, distances must be reported correctly, and the trail must be clearly described to the competitors. The racers have a duty to treat their dogs humanely, and performance-enhancing substances are strictly forbidden.

Dryland Dog Sled Racing is a variant where competitors use a rig (3–4-wheeled cart with a locking brake and handle/steering wheel), a scooter, a bicycle (Bikejoring), or remain on foot (Canicross), racing on packed dirt trails instead of snow. Another mode of dogsled racing is the &quot;freight race,&quot; in which a specified weight per dog is carried in the sled. This type of race only has about 1 to 5 dogs pulling the sled or scooter at one time.

There is also a huge following in the UK with the British Siberian Husky Racing Association providing premier racing on top-class trails.

===American Dog Derby===

The American Dog Derby is the oldest dogsled race in the United States and was the first dogsled race that rose to international prominence. Begun in 1917 and heavily promoted by Union Pacific Railroad, it was on par with the Kentucky Derby and with the Indianapolis 500 in terms of interest and press coverage in the early part of the 20th century and was considered to be the world championship dogsled race. American Dog Derby mushers were international celebrities to such degree that one photogenic female musher named Lydia Hutchinson was tapped by a producer to star in his movie. She may have been on her way to being a movie star when she died of pneumonia in 1930. The American Dog Derby popularized dogsled racing in the 1920s and other dogsled races were organized in towns and cities across North America and Northern Europe in its wake.

===Iditarod===

The most famous long-distance race is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. Also known as the &quot;Last Great Race on Earth&quot;, the Iditarod is roughly 1000 miles of some of the roughest terrain in the world. The race consists of fierce mountains, frozen rivers, thick forests, and desolate tundras. Each team of 12–16 dogs must go from Anchorage all the way to Nome.

Although each musher has different strategies, each team must have certain pieces of equipment, such as an arctic parka, an ax, snowshoes, and boots for each dog&#x27;s feet to protect against cutting ice and hard packed snow injuries.

==The dog sled==

Racing sleddogs wear individual harnesses to which &quot;tuglines&quot; are snapped, pulling from a loop near the root of the tail. The dogs are hooked in pairs, their tuglines being attached in turn to a central &quot;gangline&quot;. The lines usually include short &quot;necklines&quot; snapped to each dog&#x27;s collar, just to keep the dogs in proper position. It is unusual ever to see more than 22 dogs hooked at once in a racing team, and that number is usually seen only on the first day of the most highly competitive sprint events. Dogs may be omitted from the teams on subsequent days, but none may be added. Many other rules apply, most of which have been in effect since the beginning of organized dogsled racing in the city of Nome, Alaska, in 1908.

== Sled dog racing in South Africa ==
In December 2013 the South Gauteng High Court confirmed sled dog racing as a form of dog racing, and therefore sled dog racing was declared illegal in South Africa.

<text>Mark David Chapman (born May 10, 1955) is an American man who murdered English musician John Lennon in New York City on December 8, 1980. As Lennon walked into the archway of The Dakota, his apartment building on the Upper West Side, Chapman fired five shots at the musician from a few yards away with a Charter Arms Undercover .38 Special revolver. Lennon was hit four times from the back. He was rushed to Roosevelt Hospital and pronounced dead on arrival. Chapman remained at the scene following the shooting and made no attempt to flee or resist arrest.
Raised in Decatur, Georgia, Chapman was initially a fan of the Beatles, but was infuriated by Lennon&#x27;s lavish lifestyle, the lyrics of &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Imagine&quot;, and public statements such as his remark about the band being &quot;more popular than Jesus&quot;. In the years leading up to the murder, the J. D. Salinger novel &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; took on great personal significance for Chapman, to the extent that he wished to model his life after the novel&#x27;s protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Chapman also contemplated killing other public figures, including David Bowie, Johnny Carson, Elizabeth Taylor, Paul McCartney, and Ronald Reagan. He had no prior criminal convictions and had recently resigned from a job as a security guard in Hawaii.

Following the murder, Chapman&#x27;s legal team intended to mount an insanity defense based on the testimony of mental health experts who said that he was in a delusional psychotic state at the time of the shooting. However, he was more cooperative with the prosecutor, who argued that his symptoms fell short of a schizophrenia diagnosis. As the trial approached, Chapman instructed his lawyers that he wanted to plead guilty based on what he had decided was the will of God. The judge granted Chapman&#x27;s request and deemed him competent to stand trial. He was sentenced to a prison term of twenty years to life with a stipulation that mental health treatment would be provided.

Chapman refused requests for press interviews during his first six years in prison; he later said that he regretted the murder and that he did not want to give the impression that he killed Lennon for fame and notoriety. He ultimately supplied audiotaped interviews to journalist Jack Jones, who used them to write the investigative book &quot;Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman&quot; in 1992. In 2000, Chapman became eligible for parole, which has since been denied thirteen times. His life was dramatized in the films &quot;The Killing of John Lennon&quot; (2006) and &quot;Chapter 27&quot; (2007).

==Biography==
Mark David Chapman was born on May 10, 1955, in Fort Worth, Texas. His father, David Chapman, was a staff sergeant in the United States Air Force and his mother, Diane (née Pease), was a nurse. His younger sister, Susan, was born seven years later. As a boy, Chapman stated he lived in fear of his father, who he claimed was physically abusive towards his mother and unloving towards him. Chapman began to fantasize about having God-like power over a group of imaginary &quot;little people&quot; who lived in the walls of his bedroom.

Chapman moved to Decatur, Georgia, at an early age and attended Columbia High School. He later recalled being targeted by bullies due to his lack of athleticism. By the time he was 14, Chapman was using drugs and skipping classes, and at one point ran away from home to live on the streets of Miami for two weeks.

In 1971, Chapman became a born-again Presbyterian and distributed Biblical tracts. He met his first girlfriend, Jessica Blankenship, and began work as a summer camp counselor at the YMCA in DeKalb County, Georgia. He was very popular with the children at the camp, who nicknamed him &quot;Nemo&quot; (after the protagonist of the Jules Verne novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;), and he was promoted to assistant director after winning an award for Outstanding Counselor. Those who knew Chapman in the caretaking professions said he was an outstanding worker.

On the recommendation of a friend, Chapman read J. D. Salinger&#x27;s novel &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; (1951). The novel eventually took on great personal significance for him, to the extent he reportedly wished to model his life after its main character, Holden Caulfield. After graduating from high school, Chapman moved for a time to Chicago and played guitar in churches and Christian night spots while his friend did impersonations. He worked successfully for World Vision with Vietnamese refugees at a resettlement camp at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas, after a brief visit to Lebanon for the same work. He was named an area coordinator and a key aide to program director David Moore, who later said Chapman cared deeply for children and worked hard. Chapman accompanied Moore to meetings with government officials, and U.S. President Gerald Ford shook his hand.

Chapman joined Blankenship as a student at Covenant College, a Presbyterian liberal arts college in Lookout Mountain, Georgia. However, he fell behind in his studies and became racked with guilt over having a previous affair. He started having suicidal thoughts and began to feel like a failure. He dropped out of Covenant College after just one semester, and his girlfriend broke off their relationship soon after. Chapman returned to work at the resettlement camp but left after an argument with a supervisor.

In 1977, Chapman relocated to Hawaii, where he attempted suicide by carbon monoxide asphyxiation. He connected a hose to his car&#x27;s exhaust pipe, but the hose melted and the attempt failed. A psychiatrist admitted Chapman to Castle Memorial Hospital for clinical depression. Upon his release, he began working at the hospital as a maintenance worker. After Chapman&#x27;s parents began divorce proceedings, his mother joined him in Hawaii.

In 1978, Chapman embarked on a six-week trip around the world. The vacation was partly inspired by the film and novel &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;. Using his YMCA connections for free or discounted accommodations, Chapman visited Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, New Delhi, Beirut, Geneva, London, Paris and Dublin. The trip concluded with a brief visit to Atlanta to visit his family. He also began a romantic relationship with his travel agent, a Japanese American woman named Gloria Abe, whom he married on June 2, 1979. Chapman got a job at Castle Memorial Hospital as a printer, working alone rather than with staff and patients. He was fired by the hospital but was later rehired. Following an argument with a nurse he quit. After this, Chapman took a job as a night security guard at a high-end apartment complex and began drinking heavily to cope with depression.

As his psychological state worsened, Chapman developed a series of obsessions, including artwork, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, and the English musician John Lennon. In September 1980 he wrote a letter to a friend, Lynda Irish, in which he stated, &quot;I&#x27;m going nuts.&quot; He signed the letter, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye.&quot; Chapman had no criminal convictions prior to his trip to New York City to kill Lennon.

==Murder of John Lennon==
===Motive and planning===
Chapman allegedly started planning to kill Lennon three months prior to the murder. A longtime fan of Lennon&#x27;s former band the Beatles, Chapman turned against Lennon due to a religious conversion and Lennon&#x27;s highly publicized 1966 remark about the Beatles being &quot;more popular than Jesus.&quot; Some members of Chapman&#x27;s prayer group made a joke in reference to Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Imagine&quot;: &quot;It went, &#x27;Imagine, imagine if John Lennon was dead. One of Chapman&#x27;s childhood friends, Miles McManushe, recalled that Chapman said that the song was &quot;communist.&quot;

Chapman had also been influenced by Anthony Fawcett&#x27;s &quot;John Lennon: One Day at a Time&quot;, which detailed Lennon&#x27;s lavish lifestyle in New York City. According to Gloria, &quot;He was angry that Lennon would preach love and peace but yet have millions.&quot; Chapman later said: &quot;He told us to imagine no possessions and there he was, with millions of dollars and yachts and farms and country estates, laughing at people like me who had believed the lies and bought the records and built a big part of their lives around his music.&quot; He also recalled having listened to Lennon&#x27;s solo albums in the weeks before the murder: 
Chapman&#x27;s planning has been described as &quot;muddled.&quot; Over the years, he has both supported and denied whether he felt justified by his spiritual beliefs at the time or had the intention of acquiring notoriety. The only time he made a public statement before his sentencing—and for several years afterward—was during a brief psychotic episode in which he was convinced that the meaning of his actions was to promote &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, which amounted to a single letter mailed to &quot;The New York Times&quot; asking the public to read the novel.

Journalist James R. Gaines, who interviewed Chapman extensively, concluded that Chapman did not kill Lennon to gain fame and notoriety. According to Chapman in a later parole hearing, he had a hit list of other potential targets in mind, including Lennon&#x27;s bandmate Paul McCartney, talk show host Johnny Carson, actress Elizabeth Taylor, actor George C. Scott, former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, recently elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Hawaii governor George Ariyoshi. In 2010, Chapman said that the only criterion for the list was being &quot;famous,&quot; and that he chose Lennon out of convenience. He had also cited feelings of envy.

It is rumored that Chapman traveled to Woodstock, New York, during one of his visits to the state in search of the musician Todd Rundgren, another target of obsession. Chapman was wearing a promotional T-shirt for Rundgren&#x27;s album &quot;Hermit of Mink Hollow&quot; when he was arrested and had a copy of &quot;&quot; in his Manhattan hotel room. Rundgren was not aware of the connections until much later.

On the day of the murder, singer David Bowie was appearing on Broadway in the play &quot;The Elephant Man.&quot; &quot;I was second on his list,&quot; Bowie later said. &quot;Chapman had a front-row ticket to &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; the next night. John and Yoko were supposed to sit front-row for that show too. So the night after John was killed there were three empty seats in the front row. I can&#x27;t tell you how difficult that was to go on. I almost didn&#x27;t make it through the performance.&quot;

===October–December 1980===

Chapman went to New York City in late October 1980 intending to kill Lennon, but left to obtain ammunition from his unwitting friend Dana Reeves in Atlanta before returning in November. While in New York, Chapman was inspired by the film &quot;Ordinary People&quot; to stop his plans. He returned to Hawaii and told his wife Gloria that he had been obsessed with killing Lennon, showing her the gun and bullets; Gloria did not inform the police or mental health services. Chapman later said that the commandment &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot; flashed on the television at him and was on a wall hanging that his wife put up in their apartment. He made an appointment to see a clinical psychologist, but he did not keep it and flew back to New York on December 6, 1980. At one point, he considered ending his life by jumping from the Statue of Liberty.

On December 7, Chapman accosted singer James Taylor at the 72nd Street subway station. According to Taylor, &quot;The guy had sort of pinned me to the wall and was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about what he was going to do and his stuff with how John was interested and he was going to get in touch with John Lennon.&quot; He also reportedly offered cocaine to a taxi driver. That night, Chapman and his wife talked on the phone about getting help with his problems by first working on his relationship with God.

On the morning of December 8, Chapman left his room at the Sheraton Hotel, leaving personal items behind that he wanted the police to find. He bought a copy of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; in which he wrote &quot;this is my statement&quot;, signing it &quot;Holden Caulfield.&quot; He then spent most of the day near the entrance to the Dakota apartment building where Lennon lived, talking to fans and the doorman. Early in the morning, Chapman was distracted and missed seeing Lennon step out of a taxi and enter the Dakota. Later in the morning, he met Lennon&#x27;s housekeeper, who was returning from a walk with Lennon&#x27;s five-year-old son Sean. Chapman reached in front of the housekeeper to shake Sean&#x27;s hand and called him a beautiful boy, quoting Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy).&quot;

Around 5 p.m., Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono were leaving the Dakota for a recording session at the Record Plant. As they walked toward their limousine, Chapman, without saying a word, held out a copy of Lennon&#x27;s album &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; (1980) for Lennon to sign. Amateur photographer Paul Goresh was standing nearby and took a picture as Lennon signed the album. Chapman said in an interview that he tried to get Goresh to stay, and he asked another loitering Lennon fan to go out with him that night. He suggested that he would not have murdered Lennon that evening if the woman had accepted his invitation or if Goresh had stayed, but he probably would have tried another day.

Around 10:50 p.m., Lennon and Ono returned to the Dakota in a limousine. They got out of the vehicle, passed Chapman, and walked toward the archway entrance of the building. From the street behind them, Chapman fired five hollow-point bullets from a .38 special revolver, four of which hit Lennon in the back and shoulder. One newspaper later reported that Chapman called out &quot;Mr. Lennon&quot; and dropped into a combat stance before firing. Chapman said that he does not recall saying anything, and Lennon did not turn around.

Chapman remained at the scene following the shooting and appeared to be reading &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; when New York City police officers arrived and arrested him without incident. The officers recognized that Lennon&#x27;s wounds were severe and decided not to wait for an ambulance; they rushed him to Roosevelt Hospital in a squad car. Lennon was pronounced dead on arrival. Three hours later, Chapman told the police, &quot;I&#x27;m sure the big part of me is Holden Caulfield, who is the main person in the book. The small part of me must be the Devil.&quot;

==Legal process==
Chapman was formally charged with second-degree murder which was the most serious murder charge in New York State law for killing a non-law officer. He confessed to police that he had used hollow-point bullets &quot;to ensure Lennon&#x27;s death.&quot; Chapman&#x27;s wife had known of her husband&#x27;s preparations for killing Lennon, but took no action because Chapman did not follow through at the time; she did not face any charges. Chapman later said that he harbored a &quot;deep-seated resentment&quot; toward his wife, &quot;that she didn&#x27;t go to somebody, even the police, and say, &#x27;Look, my husband&#x27;s bought a gun and he says he&#x27;s going to kill John Lennon.

===Mental state assessment===
More than a dozen psychologists and psychiatrists interviewed Chapman in the six months prior to his trial—three for the prosecution, six for the defense, and several more on behalf of the court—and they conducted a battery of standard diagnostic procedures and more than 200 hours of clinical interviews. All six defense experts concluded that Chapman was psychotic; five diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia, while the sixth felt that his symptoms were more consistent with manic depression. The three prosecution experts declared that his delusions fell short of psychosis and instead diagnosed various personality disorders. The court-appointed experts concurred with the prosecution&#x27;s examiners that he was delusional yet competent to stand trial. In the examinations, Chapman was more cooperative with the prosecution&#x27;s mental health experts than with those for the defense; one psychiatrist conjectured that he did not wish to be considered &quot;crazy&quot; and was persuaded that the defense experts declared him insane only because they were hired to do so.

Charles McGowan, who had been the pastor of Chapman&#x27;s church in Decatur, visited Chapman. &quot;I believe there was a demonic power at work,&quot; he said. Chapman initially embraced his old religion with new fervor as a result; but McGowan revealed information to the press that Chapman had told him in confidence, so Chapman disavowed his renewed interest in Christianity and reverted to his initial explanation: he had killed Lennon to promote the reading of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;.

===Guilty plea===
Chapman&#x27;s court-appointed lawyer, Herbert Adlerberg, withdrew from the case amid threats of lynching. Police feared that Lennon fans might storm the hospital, so they transferred Chapman to Rikers Island for his personal safety.

At the initial hearing in January 1981, Chapman&#x27;s new lawyer, Jonathan Marks, instructed him to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. In February, Chapman sent a handwritten statement to &quot;The New York Times&quot; urging everyone to read &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; calling it an &quot;extraordinary book that holds many answers.&quot; The defense team sought to establish witnesses as to Chapman&#x27;s mental state at the time of the killing. However, Chapman told Marks in June that he wanted to drop the insanity defense and plead guilty. Marks objected with &quot;serious questions&quot; over Chapman&#x27;s sanity and legally challenged his competence to make this decision. In the pursuant hearing on June 22, Chapman said that God had told him to plead guilty and that he would never change his plea or ever appeal, regardless of his sentence. Marks told the court that he opposed Chapman&#x27;s change of plea, but Chapman would not listen to him. Judge Dennis Edwards Jr. refused a further assessment, saying that Chapman had made the decision of his own free will, and declared him competent to stand trial.

===Sentencing hearing===
The sentencing hearing took place on August 24, 1981, in a crowded courtroom. Two experts gave evidence on Chapman&#x27;s behalf. Judge Edwards interrupted Dorothy Lewis, a research psychiatrist who was relatively inexperienced in the courtroom, indicating that the purpose of the hearing was to determine the sentence and there was no question of Chapman&#x27;s criminal responsibility. Lewis had maintained that Chapman&#x27;s decision to change his plea did not appear reasonable or explicable, and she implied that the judge did not want to allow an independent competency assessment. The district attorney argued that Chapman committed the murder as an easy venture to acquire fame. Chapman was asked if he had anything to say, and he rose and read a passage from &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; in which Holden tells his little sister Phoebe what he wants to do with his life:

The judge ordered psychiatric treatment for Chapman during his incarceration and sentenced him to twenty years to life, five years less than the maximum sentence of twenty-five years to life.

==Imprisonment==

In 1981, Chapman was imprisoned at Attica Correctional Facility outside Buffalo, New York. He fasted for twenty-six days in February 1982, so the New York State Supreme Court authorized the state to force-feed him. Central New York Psychiatric Center director Martin Von Holden said that Chapman refused to eat with other inmates but agreed to take liquid nutrients. He was held in a solitary confinement unit for violent and at-risk prisoners, in part due to concern that he might be harmed by Lennon&#x27;s fans in the general population. There were 105 inmates in the facility who were &quot;not considered a threat to him,&quot; according to the New York State Department of Correctional Services. He had his own cell but spent &quot;most of his day outside his cell working on housekeeping and in the library.&quot;

Chapman worked in the prison as a legal clerk and kitchen helper. He was barred from participating in the Cephas Attica workshops, a charitable organization helping inmates adjust to life outside prison. He was also prohibited from attending the prison&#x27;s violence and anger management classes due to concern for his safety. He told a parole board in 2000 what he would do if paroled: &quot;I would immediately try to find a job, and I really want to go from place to place, at least in the state, church to church, and tell people what happened to me and point them the way to Christ.&quot; He also said that he thought that he could find work as a farmhand or return to his previous trade as a printer.

Chapman is in the Family Reunion Program, and has been allowed regular conjugal visits since 2014 with his wife since he accepted solitary confinement. The program allows him to spend forty-four hours alone with his wife in a specially built prison home, a trailer on prison grounds equipped with a kitchen, bathroom, and a bedroom. He also gets occasional visits from his sister, clergy, and a few friends. In 2004, Department of Correctional Services spokesman James Flateau said that Chapman had been involved in three &quot;minor incidents&quot; between 1989 and 1994 which included delaying an inmate count and refusing to follow an order. On May 15, 2012, he was transferred to the Wende Correctional Facility in Alden, New York, which is east of Buffalo. On March 30, 2022, he was transferred to the Green Haven Correctional Facility in Beekman, New York, which is in Dutchess County.

==Book, interviews, and media appearances==
Chapman declined all offers for interviews following the murder and during his first six years at Attica, later stating that he did not want to give the impression that he killed Lennon as a route to acquire fame and notoriety. Despite his claim that he refused all interviews during those six years, James R. Gaines interviewed him and wrote a three-part, 18,000-word &quot;People&quot; magazine series starting in 1981 and climaxing in February and March 1987. Chapman subsequently told the parole board that he regretted the interview. He gave a series of audio-taped interviews to Jack Jones of the Rochester &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot;, and Jones published &quot;Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, the Man Who Killed John Lennon&quot; in 1992. Jones asked Chapman to tell his story for &quot;Mugshots&quot;, a CourtTV program in 2000, with his first parole hearing approaching. Chapman refused to go on camera but consented to tell his story in a series of audiotapes.

On December 4, 1992, ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; aired an interview with Barbara Walters, Chapman&#x27;s first television interview. On December 17, 1992, Larry King interviewed Chapman on his CNN program &quot;Larry King Live&quot;.

==Parole applications, campaigns, and denials==
Chapman first became eligible for parole in 2000 after serving twenty years in prison. Under New York state law, he is required to have a parole hearing every two years from that year onward. Since that time, a two- or three-member board has denied Chapman parole thirteen times. Before his first parole hearing, Yoko Ono sent a letter to the board requesting that Chapman should stay behind bars and serve out the remainder of his life sentence. In addition, New York State Senator Michael Nozzolio, chairman of the Senate Crime Victims, Crime and Correction Committee, wrote to Parole Board Chairman Brion Travis saying: &quot;It is the responsibility of the New York State Parole Board to ensure that public safety is protected from the release of dangerous criminals like Mark David Chapman.&quot;

===Timeline===

* 2000: During the fifty-minute hearing, Chapman professed that he was not a threat to society and that Lennon would have approved of his release. The parole board declined and concluded that releasing him would &quot;deprecate the seriousness of the crime and serve to undermine respect for the law&quot; and that Chapman granting media interviews represented a continued interest in &quot;maintaining [his] notoriety.&quot; They noted that Chapman had a good disciplinary record while in prison, but he had been in solitary confinement and did not have access to &quot;anti-violence and/or anti-aggression programming.&quot; Correctional Association of New York lawyer Robert Gangi said that he thought it unlikely that Chapman would ever be freed because the board would not risk the &quot;political heat&quot; of releasing Lennon&#x27;s killer. Ono stated that if Chapman were released, she and John&#x27;s sons would not feel safe for the rest of their lives. &quot;I am afraid it will bring back the nightmare, the chaos and confusion once again,&quot; she added.
* 2002: Despite a positive behavioral record, the board again stated that releasing Chapman after twenty-two years in prison would &quot;deprecate the seriousness&quot; of the crime. Some counterarguments have stated that this basis was no predictor of his potential community behavior.
* 2004: The parole board held a third hearing and declined parole. One of the reasons given by the board was that Chapman had subjected Ono to &quot;monumental suffering by her witnessing the crime.&quot; Another factor was concern for Chapman&#x27;s safety; several Lennon fans threatened to kill him upon his release. Ono&#x27;s letter opposing his release stated that Chapman would not be safe outside of prison. The board reported that its decision was based on the interview, a review of records, and deliberation. By this time, approximately 6,000 people had signed an online petition opposing Chapman&#x27;s release.
* 2006: The parole board held a sixteen-minute hearing and concluded that his release would not be in the best interest of the community or his own personal safety. On the twenty-sixth anniversary of Lennon&#x27;s death, Ono published a one-page advertisement in several newspapers, saying that December 8 should be a &quot;day of forgiveness,&quot; but she was not sure if she was ready to forgive Chapman.
* 2008: Chapman was denied parole at his fifth hearing &quot;due to concern for the public safety and welfare.&quot;
* 2010: In advance of Chapman&#x27;s scheduled sixth parole hearing, Ono said that she would again oppose his parole, stating that her safety, that of Lennon&#x27;s sons, and Chapman&#x27;s would be at risk. The parole board postponed the hearing in September, stating that it was awaiting additional information to complete Chapman&#x27;s record. On September 7, the board denied Chapman&#x27;s parole application, with the panel stating that &quot;release remains inappropriate at this time and incompatible with the welfare of the community.&quot;
* 2012: Chapman&#x27;s seventh parole hearing was held in August. The board announced the following day that his parole request was denied, on the grounds that they believed he would reoffend. &quot;Despite your positive efforts while incarcerated, your release at this time would greatly undermine respect for the law and tend to trivialize the tragic loss of life which you caused as a result of this heinous, unprovoked, violent, cold and calculated crime.&quot;
* 2014: Chapman&#x27;s eighth parole application was denied. Chapman told the board, &quot;I am sorry for being such an idiot and choosing the wrong way for glory... I found my peace in Jesus. I know him. He loves me. He has forgiven me. He has helped in my life like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.&quot; The board was unmoved, telling Chapman that it believed that &quot;there is a reasonable probability that you would not live and remain at liberty without again violating the law.&quot;
* 2016: Chapman&#x27;s parole was denied. Chapman said that he now saw his crime as being &quot;premeditated, selfish and evil.&quot;
* 2018: Denied for the tenth time, the parole board wrote to Chapman that he was at low risk to reoffend, but that he &quot;admittedly carefully planned and executed the murder of a world-famous person for no reason other than to gain notoriety.&quot; The board added, &quot;While no one person&#x27;s life is any more valuable than another&#x27;s life, the fact that you chose someone who was not only a world-renowned person and beloved by millions, regardless of pain and suffering you would cause to his family, friends, and so many others, you demonstrated a callous disregard for the sanctity of human life and the pain and suffering of others. This fact remains a concern to this panel.&quot;
* 2020: Chapman&#x27;s parole was denied for the eleventh time. Officials said he was refused parole as &quot;it would be incompatible with the welfare of society&quot;. According to the tapes acquired by ABC News, he sought glory in killing a member of the Beatles.
* 2022: In Chapman&#x27;s twelfth parole hearing, he admitted he knew what he did was wrong, but &quot;wanted the fame too much&quot;, and that he wanted to be a &quot;somebody, and nothing was going to stop that&quot;. The board denied him parole, citing his &quot;selfish disregard for human life of global consequence&quot;, they also added &quot;The worldwide impact of your crime resonates such as to evoke images, memories and emotions internationally, leading the panel to concur that your release at this time would be incompatible with the welfare of society&quot; and also noted his action leaving lasting ramifications of &quot;the world recovering from the void of which he created&quot;.
* 2024: Chapman appeared before the parole board in early March, and he was again denied parole.
* 2025: Chapman&#x27;s fourteenth parole hearing is scheduled for August.
==In film==
Two biographical films center on Chapman and the murder: &quot;The Killing of John Lennon&quot; (2006), directed by Andrew Piddington and starring Jonas Ball as Chapman and &quot;Chapter 27&quot; (2007), directed by J. P. Schaefer and starring Jared Leto as Chapman.

<text>Jack Wagner (May 20, 1891 – July 13, 1963) was an American Academy Award nominee screenwriter and cinematographer mostly during the silent era of motion pictures.

==Biography==
Born in Monterey, California, United States, Wagner was one of five children, all boys, of William Wallace Wagner, a railroad conductor, and Edith Wagner, a writer who provided dispatches for the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; during the Mexican Revolution. He lived in Mexico from about 1895 to 1909 before moving to Los Angeles to work for D. W. Griffith on his early films. Between the years 1909 and 1912, Wagner worked mostly as a furniture painter, set designer and second unit cameraman. He then turned his attention to gag writing and found a job with Mack Sennett writing gags for Keystone Cops shorts. His specialty was comedy construction, especially the famed car chase scenes. He often alternated between writing comedy and working behind the camera as a principal photographer or assistant cameraman.

When the United States entered World War I, he joined the Army&#x27;s first motion picture unit with the Signal Corps. He was assigned to filming Air Corps footage. He also filmed battles involving American forces at the Marne, St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne. He was discharged in 1919. He continued working through the teens and 1920s as a gag writer and cameraman for Fox Films and the Hall Room Boys Photoplays. He also worked as an assistant director and second unit man for such directors as Allan Dwan and Lewis Milestone. He also was on Corrine Griffith and Constance Talmadge&#x27;s writing production staffs. One of his last cinematography assignments before turning to screenwriting full-time was as a second unit cameraman for Rex Ingram&#x27;s &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;.

In the mid-1920s he wrote gags for Harry Langdon and Will Rogers on the Mack Sennett and Hal Roach comedy lots. When talkies arrived, Wagner found himself making the difficult transition from silent films to sound. He never achieved the success he found in silents. Yet he found steady work as a gag man, adding bits of dialogue to comedy and dramatic films. He also worked as a director for the Spanish-language division of Fox Films, which included films &quot;Cupido Chauffeur&quot; and &quot;Entre Platos y Notas&quot;. In 1934, he helped script &quot;The Little Minister&quot; with Katharine Hepburn. He also co-wrote the short film &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; (1934), which garnered RKO Radio Pictures an Academy Award.

Even after this success, he struggled with writer&#x27;s block. When he came up with the story idea for &quot;A Medal for Benny&quot; (1945), he again was troubled with putting the story to paper. He had known John Steinbeck for many years. Steinbeck had considered Jack&#x27;s mother, Edith Wagner, as his first writing coach while growing up in Salinas, California. Jack and his brothers – Max, Blake and Bob – had been steady friends and drinking buddies with Steinbeck since the 1920s. After much work Steinbeck and Jack wrote the script for &quot;Benny&quot; and it earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. He went on to help Steinbeck with another script on &quot;The Pearl&quot;. He closed out his career as a producer of Mexican films featuring such actresses as Dolores del Río, among others. He died in Los Angeles.

<text>CobbLinc (formerly Cobb Community Transit) is the bus public transit system in Cobb County, Georgia, one of metro Atlanta&#x27;s three most populous suburban counties. CobbLinc began operations in July 1989 (as Cobb Community Transit) and has had relatively strong ridership (3,793,253 total passengers in 2005) since then.

==Operation==

CobbLinc has two hubs. Marietta Transit Center is along South Marietta Parkway in Marietta, just west of the former Southern Polytechnic State University now the Marietta campus of Kennesaw State University. Routes connect to the most populated areas of the county, including Mableton and Kennesaw. Express routes also operate down to Atlanta, connecting with MARTA at the Arts Center station. Transfers are free between MARTA and CCT, though both transit agencies charge the same fare ($2.50) with a Breeze Card. CobbLinc&#x27;s annual operating budget is about $12.9 million (2004), from fares and the general county budget, as well as Federal grants.

All buses make automatic announcements inside the bus of upcoming stops and major roads, and stop requests from passengers. This is done by pre-recorded voice announcements for the vision-impaired and LED message signs for the hearing-impaired. External announcements are also made by voice, in addition to the normal electronic signs. Some buses also run on compressed natural gas (CNG) rather than diesel.

==Planning==
Along with Gwinnett, Cobb voted against MARTA in the 1970s, and thus was left out of the system. The lack of sales tax revenue from the two counties stunted the growth of MARTA, however the GRTA created by former governor of Georgia Roy Barnes has been seeking to create other solutions, such as possible light rail to Cobb through the Cumberland Mall and Town Center at Cobb areas. Other solutions proposed include special bus-only lanes on Interstate 75, and commuter rail into Cherokee County. A cross-suburb line over to Gwinnett County has also been proposed, intersecting with a future extended MARTA north line between Roswell and Sandy Springs in Fulton County.

===2019 Light Rail Proposal===
In May 2010 Cobb&#x27;s Board of Commissioners approved further funding to study a light rail line from the Cumberland/Galleria area to the Town Center/KSU area. If constructed, the line would be approximately long with seven stations. The proposed line would be constructed and operational by 2019 with the expectation of nearly 50,000 riders daily by 2025. At each end of the line, a circulator bus system has also been proposed bringing the total expected ridership for the new combined LRT/BRT system to nearly 100,000. The project would be funded and operated through both federal and local sources. As of 2010, it is unclear whether or not the new transit system would be operated by CCT, a new agency, or even another existing agency such as MARTA.

===Flex Busses and Shuttles ===

<doc id="274907" wikidata="Q5623666" url="?curid=274907" title="Ride Gwinnett">
<text>Ride Gwinnett (formerly known as Gwinnett County Transit or GCT prior to 2023) is the bus public transit system in Gwinnett County, Georgia, United States, one of metro Atlanta&#x27;s three most populous suburban counties. It was formed in 2000, with express buses starting in November 2001 and local buses in November 2002.

Routes connect to the most populated areas of the county, including Norcross and Lawrenceville. With the assistance of the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA), express services are available to Atlanta, connecting with MARTA at the Doraville, Civic Center, and Five Points stations. Transfers are free between MARTA and Ride Gwinnett, with use of a Breeze card or ticket.

== History ==
Along with Cobb, Gwinnett voted against MARTA in 1971 and thus was left out of a system. The lack of sales tax revenue from the two counties stunted the growth of MARTA; however, GRTA, created by former Governor of Georgia Roy Barnes, has been seeking to create other solutions, such as transit for the entire Atlanta and surrounding areas. The Gwinnett Place Community Improvement District (GPCID) along with MARTA are seeking alternative, such as light rail to Gwinnett through the Gwinnett Place area.

Ride Gwinnett allows payment via Breeze cards, tickets &amp; passes, the Breeze Mobile 2.0 app, cash/card with fareboxes equipped on all buses, and the Ride Gwinnett app for paratransit users.

In 2015, Ride Gwinnett was investigated by local news for overcharging some patrons of the GRTA Xpress bus routes when using Breeze cards to pay transit fares. GRTA has acknowledged the issue in a few printed handbills advising patrons to purchase multiple Breeze cards (one for each type of bus or rail fare) to pay transit fares and record transfers between the GRTA, CobbLinc, and MARTA transit systems.

In 2016, Ride Gwinnett started a new express route, 110, that serviced the Indian Trail Park and Ride area to the Emory/CDC employment center. Some service was expanded to Sugarloaf Park and Ride Lot in May 2017.

In September 2018, MARTA&#x27;s board of directors and the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners gave conditional approval to an agreement which would see the county to contract with MARTA for the operations of the service. This included county designed and built projects, significantly expanding bus service in the county and clear the way for a long-sought-after extension of MARTA&#x27;s rail system into the county from its current terminus at Doraville. The contract with MARTA would go into effect only if a public vote, scheduled for March 2019, succeeds. The agreement calls for a new one-cent sales tax that would be collected in Gwinnett County until 2057.
The transit referendum failed on March 19, 2019.

In July 2020, the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners called for another transit referendum, this time through the House Bill 930/ATL mechanism. Projects would have been designed, built and operated all by Gwinnett County. The referendum failed on the November ballot with a final vote total of 198,514 for yes and 199,527 voting no.

In January 2023, Gwinnett County Transit officially changed its name to Ride Gwinnett.

In September 2023, Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved a new Transit Plan which focused heavily on microtransit zones, simpler local routes, and direct airport rides. This plan notably does not include any rail components or MARTA expansion into the county. 

On June 4, 2024, the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners approved, 4-1, another transit referendum to be placed on the ballot for the November 5, 2024 General Election. It would impose a one percent sales tax for 30 years, funding up to 75 projects from the 2023 Transit Plan, and would shift all existing operational expenses off of property taxes onto the new sales tax. The referendum failed to pass 47-53%.

== Routes ==

<doc id="274908" wikidata="Q275365" url="?curid=274908" title="Ship's bell">
<text>A ship&#x27;s bell is a bell on a ship that is used for the indication of time as well as other traditional functions. The bell itself is usually made of brass or bronze, and normally has the ship&#x27;s name engraved or cast on it.

==Strikes==
===Timing of ship&#x27;s watches===

Unlike civil clock bells, the strikes of a ship&#x27;s bell do not accord to the number of the hour. Instead, there are eight bells, one for each half-hour of a four-hour watch. In the age of sailing, watches were timed with a 30-minute hourglass. Bells would be struck every time the glass was turned, and in a pattern of pairs for easier counting, with any odd bells at the end of the sequence.

====Classical system====
The classical, or traditional, system was:

Most of the crew of a ship would be divided into two to four groups, called watches. Each watch would take its turn with the essential activities of manning the helm, navigating, trimming sails, and keeping a lookout.

The hours between 16:00 and 20:00 are so arranged because that watch (the &quot;dog watch&quot;) was divided in two. The odd number of watches aimed to give each person a different watch each day; it also allowed the entire crew of a vessel to eat an evening meal, the normal time being at 17:00 with first dog watchmen eating at 18:00.

====Simpler system====
Some &quot;ship&#x27;s bell&quot; clocks use a simpler system:

===Other uses===
*Ship&#x27;s bells are also used for safety in foggy conditions, their most important modern use.
*On US naval vessels, bells additionally are rung as &quot;boat gongs&quot; for officers and dignitaries coming aboard or leaving the ship, in a number equivalent to the number of sideboys to which the visitor is entitled.
*At midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 16 bells would be struck – eight bells for the old year and eight bells for the new.
*When a sailor has died he or she can be honoured with the sounding of eight bells; meaning &quot;end of the watch&quot;. The term &quot;eight bells&quot; can also be used in an obituary, as a nautical euphemism for &quot;finished&quot;.

==Markings on the bell==

The ship&#x27;s name is traditionally engraved or cast onto the surface of the bell, often with the year the ship was launched, as well. The earliest ship&#x27;s bell was recovered from the wreck-site of a Portuguese armada ship off the coast of Oman. The bell was dated 1498. Occasionally (especially on more modern ships) the bell will also carry the name of the shipyard that built the ship. If a ship&#x27;s name is changed, maritime tradition is that the original bell carrying the original name will remain with the vessel. A ship&#x27;s bell is a prized possession when a ship is broken up and often provides the only positive means of identification in the case of a shipwreck.

==Number of bells==

Most United States Navy ships of the post–World War II era have actually carried 2 or 3 bells: the larger bell engraved with the ship&#x27;s name, mounted on the forecastle, and smaller bells in the pilot house and at the quarterdeck at the 1MC (public address) station, for use in making shipwide announcements and marking the time. The larger bell on the forecastle is rung periodically as a fog signal when the ship is at anchor in reduced visibility.

==Cook and boatswain==
According to seafaring legend, the ship&#x27;s cooks and boatswain&#x27;s mates had a duty arrangement to give the cooks more sleep. The boatswain&#x27;s mates, who worked 24 hours a day on watches, would build the fire in the stove, so the cook could get up a little while later and the fire would be already going so he could begin preparing breakfast. In return, between meals, the cooks would shine the bell, which was traditionally the boatswain&#x27;s mates&#x27; responsibility.

==Baptizing children==
It is a naval tradition to baptize children using the ship&#x27;s bell as a baptismal font and to engrave the names of the children on the bell afterwards. Christening information from the bells held by the Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt Museum has been entered into a searchable data archive.

<doc id="274909" wikidata="Q833811" url="?curid=274909" title="Bushshrike">
<text>The bushshrikes are smallish passerine birds. They were formerly classed with the true shrikes in the family Laniidae, but are now considered sufficiently distinctive to be separated from that group as the family Malaconotidae, a name that alludes to their fluffy back and rump feathers.

Like their shrike-like relatives, the helmetshrikes, the bushshrikes have arisen in Africa in relatively recent times. The family is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa but completely absent from Madagascar, where the vangas are their closest relatives. They are found in scrub or open woodland, and less often in marshes, Afromontane or tropical forest. They are similar in habits to shrikes, hunting insects and other small prey from a perch on a bush. Although similar in build to the shrikes, these tend to be either colourful species or largely black; some species are quite secretive.

Some bushshrikes have flamboyant displays. The male puffbacks puff out the loose feathers on their rump and lower back, to look almost ball-like.

These are mainly insectivorous forest or scrub birds. Up to four eggs are laid in a cup nest in a tree.

==Taxonomy==
Bock has posited that the family name Malaconotidae was first used by William Swainson in 1824; however, this is disputed by Storrs Olson, who reports that Swainson used the term &quot;Malaconoti&quot; as a non-defining plural, and placed the genus in the Thamnophilinae within the shrike family Laniidae.
Peters regarded the group as a subfamily, Malaconotinae, of the shrikes. In 1971, the group was raised to family status, with their resemblance to typical shrikes considered to be more a result of convergent evolution.

Bushshrikes, helmetshrikes (Prionopidae), ioras (Aegithinidae), vangas (Vangidae) and the Australian butcherbirds, magpies and currawongs (Cracticidae) and woodswallows (Artamidae) are part of a large group of shrike-like birds distributed from Africa to Australia, which have been defined as the superfamily Malaconotoidea by Cacraft and colleagues in 2004. Previously, bushshrikes and helmetshrikes have been considered part of the Old World shrike family, Laniidae, based on shared characteristics including a hooked bill. However, analysis of behavioral and molecular characteristics places Malaconotidae closer to Platysteiridae and Vangidae, suggesting that the birds of the family Laniidae are only distant relatives.

An intron-comparison study by Fuchs et al. in 2004 provided strong support for the monophyly of the Malaconotidae, but the relationships between the genera of the family remain unclear. The genus &quot;Nilaus&quot; is morphologically more similar to Prionopidae than the rest of the bushshrike family is, but the results presented by Fuchs et al. place it within Malaconotidae. This placement is supported by DNA/DNA hybridization data as well as studies of hind limb musculature. The genus &quot;Dryoscopus&quot; consists of six small species with similar coloring, which may be closely related to birds of the genus &quot;Tchagra&quot;. The genus &quot;Malaconotus&quot; consists of six species which were traditionally believed to be closely related to &quot;Telophorus&quot; due to similar coloration, but new analyses suggest a close relationship between &quot;Malaconotus&quot; and &quot;Dryoscopus&quot; and &quot;Tchagra&quot;. Strong evidence exists for the monophyly of the genus &quot;Laniarius&quot;, and Fuchs et al. suggest its closest relatives are the genera &quot;Telophorous&quot; and &quot;Rhodophoneus&quot;, but the exact relationships are unclear.

==Description==
Bushshrikes are small to medium-sized passerines, with short, rounded wings and strong legs and feet. Plumage is typically black, grey, and brown, with some yellow and green. Some bushshrikes have red undersides or red throat-patches.

==Distribution and habitat==
Bushshrikes typically inhabit forest margins or patches of bush in savannah. Some species have been known to inhabit coffee plantations, or subsist in sacred groves where riparian vegetation is informally protected from shifting cultivation.

==Behavior==

Bushshrike diets consist mainly of large insects, but occasionally may include wild fruits and berries and sometimes rodents. They catch their prey by gleaning among tree foliage. They also join mixed bird parties, loose foraging assemblages consisting mainly of passerine birds.

Their nests are generally small and neat, and they lay clutches of 2–3 eggs.

Bushshrikes have distinctive harsh or guttural calls, which may be sung as duets. Male and female birds are able to learn songs of similar complexity, and both sexes have a similarly sized repertoire. Songs may be sung to indicate territory or as part of courtship. A 1992 study of the calls of &quot;Laniarius funebris&quot; found that a male&#x27;s likelihood of singing a mating song was correlated with his mate&#x27;s estradiol levels, rather than his own testosterone levels, suggesting that behavioral cues between a mating pair, rather than hormone levels, are more important in triggering mating songs.

<doc id="274910" wikidata="Q549014" url="?curid=274910" title="Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira">
<text>Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira (, born 2 June 1976), better known as Minotauro or Big Nog, is a Brazilian retired mixed martial artist. He competed in the heavyweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is a former Interim UFC Heavyweight Champion. He is the twin brother of UFC fighter Antônio Rogério Nogueira. Nogueira rose to prominence in Japanese promotions Fighting Network RINGS where he won the 2000 RINGS King of Kings tournament, and later with Pride Fighting Championships, where he was the first Pride Heavyweight Champion from November 2001 to March 2003, as well as a 2004 PRIDE FC Heavyweight Grand Prix Finalist. He is one of only three men to have held championship titles in both Pride Fighting Championships and the Ultimate Fighting Championship (the others being Mauricio Rua and Mark Coleman).

==Early life==
Born in the town of Vitória da Conquista, Brazil, Nogueira started training in judo at the age of 4, boxing at 14 and Brazilian jiu-jitsu at 18. At age 10, he was accidentally run over by a truck and fell into a four-day coma, losing a rib and part of his liver, and was hospitalized for eleven months. As a result of the accident, he has a large scar, including a noticeable indentation, on his lower back.

==Mixed martial arts career==
Nogueira made his mixed martial arts (MMA) debut in the World Extreme Fighting promotion, which often held events in southern parts of the United States. He won his first two fights by submission and then won the WEF Heavyweight Superfight Championship in his 5th pro fight against veteran Jeremy Horn. A few years after his MMA debut, Nogueira started training with the Brazilian Top Team.

===Rings===

====Rings: King of Kings 1999====
Nogueira debuted in Fighting Network Rings by taking part in the King of Kings 1999 tournament. He quickly submitted Valentijn Overeem and Yuriy Kochkine before clashing with middle-aged sambo champion Andrei Kopylov. Nogueira avoided a kimura lock attempt through the first round and controlled Kopylov for some minutes, before switching to stand-up in the second round and landing punches for the split decision win. In the next match, however, Nogueira was eliminated by American wrestling champion Dan Henderson in a controversial fight, as it was believed that the Brazilian had controlled the match much more than Henderson.

====Kohsaka fight====
Nogueira&#x27;s next fight was against Japanese star Tsuyoshi &quot;TK&quot; Kohsaka. The bout was back and forth, with Nogueira repeatedly gaining dominant position and striking with short punches, only for his opponent to consistently reverse him, blocking the Brazilian&#x27;s takedowns and striking as well when possible. After three rounds, the match was ruled a draw.

====Rings: King of Kings 2000====
At King of Kings 2000, Nogueira was invited back to Rings. He submitted Achmed Labasanov before facing another Japanese name in the form of Kiyoshi Tamura. Nogueira was able to take him down and threaten him with submissions, but the Japanese fighter kept defending them and coming back at openings. Finally, the second round saw Nogueira win using an armbar.

His third match in the tournament was against another sambo champion, Volk Han, who was almost twice Nogueira&#x27;s age. Han proved difficult to submit, but Nogueira controlled most of the match. After a flying kimura attempt by the Russian, Nogueira countered with an omoplata/ankle hold combination, until the match went to the judges&#x27; decision. The unanimous decision was given to the Brazilian, who advanced to the next round to face Hiromitsu Kanehara. Noguiera won the fight by submission. His final opponent in the tournament was Valentijn Overeem. Nogueira made Overeem tap out quickly and won the King of Kings tournament.

===Pride FC===

====Early PRIDE career and heavyweight championship====
Following the end of Akira Maeda&#x27;s Rings federation, Nogueira was signed by Pride Fighting Championships. He debuted in July 2001 at Pride 15, quickly submitting Gary Goodridge by triangle choke. At Pride 16, he submitted UFC and Pride Grand Prix champion Mark Coleman by triangle armbar.

Nogueira was crowned as the inaugural Pride World Heavyweight Champion after defeating Heath Herring by decision at PRIDE 17. The fast-paced bout, which saw Nogueira&#x27;s superiority at both grappling and striking, was considered by some the best heavyweight MMA fight of all time.

Nogueira next defeated Enson Inoue via technical submission due to a triangle choke and then fought for Antonio Inoki&#x27;s UFO organization, scoring his first MMA KO victory against Sanae Kikuta.

====Bouts with Sapp, Schilt and Henderson====
Nogueira then represented Pride at a co-promotion with K-1, Pride Shockwave. He was initially offered a kickboxing bout against K-1 fighter Mark Hunt, but he proposed instead to fight two separate matches under mixed martial arts and kickboxing rules respectively, which Hunt refused. Nogueira then to fight another K-1 super heavyweight, former American football player Bob Sapp, who outweighed Nogueira by 127 pounds. Due to this, Nogueira asked for special rules that banned knee strikes to a grounded opponent.

The fight soon became a brutal exhibition of technical skill against raw strength, as mere seconds into the match, Sapp would stop Nogueira&#x27;s first takedown attempt with a sound piledriver which almost ended the fight. The same outcome repeated itself several times, with Nogueira taking several powerbombs and heavy punches every time his huge antagonist managed to power out of his submission attempts. At the end, however, Sapp&#x27;s stamina started to falter, allowing a very worn out Nogueira to mount him and finally submit him with an armbar.

After defeating Sapp, Dutch kickboxing champion and former King of Pancrase Semmy Schilt was his next opponent. Nogueira scored another victory by triangle choke. He then avenged his only loss against Dan Henderson, when he armbarred him in the 3rd round after Henderson displayed great submission defense for the first two rounds.

====Title bouts====
Nogueira&#x27;s first Pride title defense was against Russian sambo champion and Volk Han apprentice Fedor Emelianenko at Pride 25. Nogueira suffered his second career loss, a judges&#x27; decision after Emelianenko dominated the fight with his characteristic ground-and-pound through the guard. In his next fight, Nogueira won a decision against former UFC heavyweight champion Ricco Rodriguez. Though Rodriguez scored takedowns and maintained top position, Pride&#x27;s fight-scoring was determined primarily by &quot;effort to finish the fight by KO or submission,&quot; and Nogueira&#x27;s multiple near-submission attempts won him the decision victory.

In November 2003, with heavyweight champion Emelianenko unable to fight due to injuries, Pride elected to crown an interim champion, so top contenders Nogueira and Mirko Cro Cop were matched up. Cro Cop dominated the first round with his superior striking and a left high kick which knocked Nogueira down in the very end of the round, but in the second round, Nogueira secured a takedown and rolled into an armbar to submit Cro Cop.

====2004 Grand Prix====
On 25 April 2004, at Pride Total Elimination 2004, the first round of the 2004 Heavyweight Grand Prix was held. Nogueira faced the unbeaten professional wrestler and former judoka Hirotaka Yokoi, whom he submitted with the debut of his &quot;anaconda choke&quot;. He then repeated the move against Heath Herring in the next round to advance to the semi-finals where he defeated Sergei Kharitonov to again face Fedor Emelianenko in the finals. The fight was markedly different from their first, with Nogueira able to avoid the damage he suffered from ground-and-pound in their first meeting. However, the bout was stopped when Emelianenko suffered a cut after an accidental head-butt and could not continue, resulting in a no-contest. Another rematch was required to determine the tournament champion and was scheduled for Pride Shockwave 2004 on 31 December 2004. In the rematch as in the first bout, Nogueira suffered another unanimous decision loss to Emelianenko after being dominated in the standing positions and being controlled on the ground.

At Pride Critical Countdown 2005, Nogueira defeated Polish Olympic judoka Pawel Nastula by strikes, and following this, at Pride 31 he beat professional wrestler and fighter Kiyoshi Tamura by armbar for the second time.

====2006 Grand Prix====
He then entered the 2006 Pride Open Weight Grand Prix, progressing to the semi-final by defeating fellow Brazilians Zuluzinho and Fabrício Werdum. In the semi-final, he faced the American catch wrestler Josh Barnett and lost a controversial split decision in which many people thought Nogueira had won the fight, as both had landed damaging blows and submission attempts without managing to secure a victory. Barnett went on to face Mirko Cro Cop in the finals, Losing to Cro Cro after submitting to punches and kicks to the face. Nogueira avenged the loss to Barnett with a dominant unanimous decision win in their rematch at Pride Shockwave 2006.

In an interview with Sherdog.com, Nogueira stated that the best moments of his career were against Bob Sapp and Mirko Cro Cop, both matches he won fighting in Pride.

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===
At UFC Fight Night 9 which took place on 5 April 2007, Nogueira was in attendance and was sitting cage side with UFC president Dana White. It was subsequently announced at UFC 69, by White, that Nogueira had joined the UFC. He was promoted initially as simply &quot;Minotauro&quot; Nogueira, much like the UFC&#x27;s promotion of Mirko Filipović as Mirko &quot;Cro Cop&quot; and Quinton Jackson as &quot;Rampage&quot; Jackson. In June 2007, he officially left Brazilian Top Team and joined Black House.

His debut in the Octagon was a third fight with Heath Herring at UFC 73, promoted under various combinations of his name and nickname, but was officially introduced to the audience under his full name and nickname. Nogueira once again defeated Herring, via unanimous decision. During the first round, Herring landed a head kick that sent Nogueira to the canvas, in which unofficial judge Eddie Bravo thought the fight could have been stopped. Herring let Nogueira get back to his feet, and Nogueira was then able to recover and come back with a dominant decision victory.

====UFC Interim Heavyweight Championship====
It was announced during the UFC 79 broadcast and subsequent press conference that Nogueira would be fighting former long time UFC Heavyweight Champion Tim Sylvia at UFC 81 for the Interim UFC Heavyweight Championship. Nogueira defeated Sylvia in the third round with a guillotine choke to become the Interim UFC Heavyweight Champion. During the fight Sylvia knocked Nogueira down with punches. After pulling Sylvia into his half guard in the third round, Nogueira quickly secured a sweep and attempted an armbar which he missed but immediately transitioned into a guillotine choke as Sylvia tried to regain his feet thus mounting a come from behind victory. Nogueira&#x27;s coach, Amaury Bitetti, said that Nogueira had trained for the guillotine well beforehand.

Nogueira and former UFC Heavyweight Champion Frank Mir were the coaches for the eighth season of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; (TUF), which premiered on 17 September 2008, on Spike TV. Both winners of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter,&quot; season 8, light heavyweight Ryan Bader and lightweight Efrain Escudero, were members of Team Nogueira. After the season concluded, coaches Nogueira and Mir met at UFC 92 for the Interim UFC Heavyweight Championship. Mir won a one-sided fight in the second round via TKO due to punches, showing much improved striking by knocking Nogueira down twice in the first round. Herb Dean stopped the match at 1:54 of the second round. The loss marked the first time Nogueira had been stopped in his career.

Two days after the fight, Dana White revealed in an interview that &quot;Nogueira had just gotten over a Staph infection.&quot; Nogueira himself verified this fact several months later in his own interview, stating that he had a Staph infection &quot;20 days before the fight, [requiring] 5 days in the hospital.&quot; When asked if this infection affected his fight, he answered: &quot;For sure.&quot; In addition to this significant illness, his knee was injured during training for which he had surgery in February 2009. Despite these legitimate handicaps, Nogueira offered strong praise for Frank Mir&#x27;s performance, with particular credit given to Mir&#x27;s ability to maintain &quot;very good distance.&quot;

==== Non-title bouts ====
The UFC next wanted to schedule Nogueira to face UFC Hall of Famer and former UFC Heavyweight and Light Heavyweight Champion Randy Couture at UFC 97, but Couture had to turn down the fight due to elbow surgery in January 2009. Couture later agreed to fight Nogueira at UFC 102 in Portland, Oregon. Nogueira defeated Couture via unanimous decision (30–27, 30–27, and 29–28). Nogueira showed much improved sharpness on his feet, and displayed his excellent chin by walking through many of Couture&#x27;s strikes while still throwing punches, eventually gaining the better of the exchanges as he scored two knockdowns of Couture in the fight. Although taken down twice, Nogueira swept from guard on both occasions (after some time on his back) to gain the full mount over Couture. On the floor, Nogueira threatened with two submissions, first with a D&#x27;Arce choke and later with an arm-triangle choke.

Nogueira was expected to face undefeated prospect Cain Velasquez on 2 January 2010, at UFC 108, but again, Nogueira caught another severe staph infection cancelling the bout. The bout instead took place on 21 February 2010, at UFC 110 in Sydney, Australia. During the bout, Nogueira was out-boxed as Velasquez landed an uppercut-right hook combo that dropped Nogueira early in the first round. Velasquez followed up with five clean shots on the ground, prompting referee Herb Dean to stop the contest, in which Velasquez earned a KO victory. At the time, Nogueira had been knocked out in two of his last three fights.

Nogueira was to face Frank Mir on 25 September 2010, at UFC 119 in a rematch from the championship bout at UFC 92. Nogueira pulled out of this fight in order to undergo needed surgery on both of his hips as well as his knee and was replaced by Mirko Cro Cop. He stated on 15 May 2011, that he would fight at the UFC&#x27;s return to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Nogueira defeated &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; alumnus Brendan Schaub by knockout due to punches in the first round on 27 August 2011, at UFC 134 in his home-city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was his first fight in over 16 months (and was billed as his &quot;return fight&quot;) and earned him his first &quot;Knockout of the Night&quot; bonus. He celebrated his victory by sitting on top of the octagon fence and displaying a Brazilian national flag with Sport Club Internacional&#x27;s emblem added to the center of the flag.

Nogueira faced Frank Mir in a rematch on 10 December 2011, at UFC 140. After close early exchanges and a lot of work against the cage, the two separated, and Nogueira rocked Mir with a hard overhand right, jab combo. After Mir fell to the ground, Nogueira continued with ground and pound before attempting a guillotine choke. Mir was able to get out of this and during a scramble, ended in side control and locked up a kimura. Nogueira managed to roll Mir, only to be reversed himself. Mir stepped his right leg over the face of Nogueira and cranked the kimura, causing Nogueira&#x27;s right humerus to break, thus ending the fight at 3:38 of round 1.

Nogueira was expected to face Cheick Kongo on 21 July 2012, at UFC 149. However, Nogueira pulled out of the bout, citing that his arm injury had not healed enough to resume the proper training and was replaced by Shawn Jordan. Nogueira fought Dave Herman on 13 October 2012, at UFC 153. He won the bout when he submitted Herman in the second round with an armbar. The finish earned him his first &quot;Submission of the Night&quot; honors.

==== Losing streak and retirement ====
Nogueira coached opposite Fabrício Werdum on the second season of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil.&quot; The two met in a rematch at the conclusion of the season, on 8 June 2013, at UFC on Fuel TV 10. This fight was a rematch of their first fight in PRIDE in which Nogueria won by unanimous decision back in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nogueira/Werdum&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After a back-and-forth first round, Nogueira lost via submission to an armbar in the second round.

Nogueira faced Roy Nelson on 11 April 2014, in the main event at UFC Fight Night 39. After dropping Nogueira several times with punches in the first round, Nelson finished the fight via knockout with an overhand right.

On 17 June 2014, Nogueira underwent successful surgery to repair a partial ACL tear of his right knee. On 9 February 2015, it was announced Nogueira would replace Anderson Silva as a head coach on &quot;The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil 4&quot;, after Silva was removed following his failed drug test.

In March 2015, Nogueira revealed in an interview with Combate that he had undergone stem cell therapy on his elbows, hips and knees. Nogueira said,They have a clinic in Kansas where they work with stem cells. What they do is they remove some cells from fat out of your back and then inject them in your joints. I did it on my elbows, my hips and knees. It stimulates cartilage growth. It&#x27;s pretty cutting edge technique. I&#x27;m responding really well so far. It&#x27;s been helping a lot with my pain. I&#x27;m still doing physiotherapy, which is responsible for curing my hips, but I&#x27;m now doing this to make it even stronger. I had a break between my last fight and &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; shootings, so I decided to go for it.
Nogueira also confessed a desire to fight Frank Mir for a third time saying,In two weeks I&#x27;ll be cleared to train freely again. First, I will get my body strong enough so I can train and be 100% ready to fight. I intend to fight at UFC 190 in August. I wanted to come back at the TUF finale card, but I&#x27;m afraid there won&#x27;t be enough time. I&#x27;ll definitely be ready in August. The UFC told me they would put me in a card in August. They didn&#x27;t say which one, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be the one in Rio. I still don&#x27;t have an opponent. They said there were three different guys I could be fighting, but I can&#x27;t comment on that. I don&#x27;t have any preferences really. I just want to come back and fight, but I would like to face Frank Mir again before the end of the year.

In turn, the promotion balked at setting up a third bout with Mir. Instead, Nogueira next faced Stefan Struve at UFC 190 on 1 August 2015. He lost the fight by unanimous decision. After the fight, UFC president Dana White said he would no longer offer Nogueira fights, effectively ending his UFC career. White also indicated that he would instead offer Nogueira a position within the company. In turn, Nogueira confirmed his intention to retire.

== Fighting style ==
Nogueira was universally known as a grappler, drawing strength from his Brazilian jiu-jitsu skills. However, he also had a well-rounded set of MMA abilities, relying on outstanding boxing and a competent takedown game. He was especially famous for his affinity to fighting from the bottom, utilizing an offensive open guard with masterful skill. His trademark moves were submissions like armbars, triangle chokes and variations of both, along with more exotic techniques. His ground game was considered &quot;on a completely different level&quot; from the rest of the sport during his time as an MMA competitor. Nogueira was also known for his solid chin and extreme ability to take punishment, which was showcased in his fights against Bob Sapp, Fedor Emilianenko and Mirko Cro Cop.

== Other media ==
From 2004 to 2005, Nogueira acted in Yomiuri TV&#x27;s sitcom television series &quot;Africa no Tsume&quot;, playing the character &quot;Nogueira.&quot; He cameoed in &quot;The Expendables&quot; along with his twin brother.

In 2023, Nogueira began working as a member of the commentary team for UFC Fight Pass Brazil.

==Personal life==
Nogueira has one daughter. On 23 August 2011, Nogueira established a partnership with Brazilian football club Internacional to represent the club&#x27;s brand in the UFC. In an interview for SporTV, Nogueira said, &quot;I&#x27;ll do my best to represent Internacional in the best possible way. Now I am 100% Internacional.&quot;

<text>The Serbian Hound (), previously known as the Balkan Hound (), is a breed of scent hound from Serbia.

==Description==
The Serbian Hound is a medium sized hound breed, the breed standard states dogs should stand between with bitches being slightly smaller, standing between , and they typically weigh around . The breed has a short, dense coat that is a distinctive reddish tan in colour, sometimes described as &quot;fox coloured&quot;, with a large black saddle and black markings above the eyes. They have a broad skull which narrows evenly to the nose and medium-length, hanging ears. The breed&#x27;s body is slightly longer than they are tall, they have a broad, straight back and a straight or slightly curved tail.

The Serbian Hound is described as well-disciplined, energetic, tenacious and lively in nature, they both track game and capture it; when hunting they have a distinctive high-pitched voice. The breed is known for its great stamina and ability to hunt over difficult terrain.

==History==
There is a long tradition of hunting in South East Europe and the Serbian Hound is one of several regional hound (and horse) breeds that were bred to suit the hunting requirements of the region. The Serbian Hound is a centuries old breed, it is believed to be a composite of hound breeds that were traded around the Mediterranean, with European and North African dogs contributing to its ancestry. The Serbian Hound is traditionally kept as a pack hound, with its usual quarry being wild boar, deer, fox and hare.

Previously known as the Balkan Hound, Balkanski Gonič (балкански гонич), in 1996 the Fédération Cynologique Internationale officially changed the breed&#x27;s name to the Serbian Hound, Srpski Gonič (Српски гонич).

<doc id="274927" wikidata="Q1099007" url="?curid=274927" title="Clave (rhythm)">
<text>The clave (; ) is a rhythmic pattern used as a tool for temporal organization in Brazilian and Cuban music. In Spanish, &quot;clave&quot; literally means key, clef, code, or keystone. It is present in a variety of genres such as Abakuá music, rumba, conga, son, mambo, salsa, songo, timba and Afro-Cuban jazz. The five-stroke clave pattern represents the structural core of many Cuban rhythms. The study of rhythmic methodology, especially in the context of Afro-Cuban music, and how it influences the mood of a piece
is known as clave theory.

The clave pattern originated in sub-Saharan African music traditions, where it serves essentially the same function as it does in Cuba. In ethnomusicology, clave is also known as a &quot;key pattern&quot;, &quot;guide pattern&quot;, &quot;phrasing referent&quot;, &quot;timeline&quot;, or &quot;asymmetrical timeline&quot;. The clave pattern is also found in the African diaspora music of Haitian Vodou drumming, Afro-Brazilian music, African-American music, Louisiana Voodoo drumming, and Afro-Uruguayan music (candombe). The clave pattern (or hambone, as it is known in the United States) is used in North American popular music as a rhythmic motif or simply a form of rhythmic decoration.

The historical roots of the clave are linked to transnational musical exchanges within the African diaspora. For instance, influences of the African “bomba” rhythm are reflected in the clave. In addition to this, the emphasis and role of the drum within the rhythmic patterns speaks further to these diasporic roots.

The clave is the foundation of reggae, reggaeton, and dancehall. In this sense, it is the “heartbeat” that underlies the essence of these genres. The rhythms and vibrations are universalized in that they demonstrate a shared cultural experience and knowledge of these roots. Ultimately, this embodies the diasporic transnational exchange.

In considering the clave as this basis of cultural understanding, relation, and exchange, this speaks to the transnational influence and interconnectedness of various communities. This musical fusion is essentially what constitutes the flow and foundational “heartbeat” of a variety of genres.

==Etymology==
&quot;Clave&quot; is a Spanish word meaning &#x27;code,&#x27; &#x27;key,&#x27; as in key to a mystery or puzzle, or &#x27;keystone,&#x27; the wedge-shaped stone in the center of an arch that ties the other stones together. The rhythm also gave the name to the claves Afro-Cuban musical instrument which consists of a pair of hardwood sticks.

==The key to Afro-Cuban rhythm==

The clave pattern holds the rhythm together in Afro-Cuban music. The two main clave patterns used in Afro-Cuban music are known in North America as &quot;son clave&quot; and the &quot;rumba clave&quot;. Both are used as bell patterns across much of Africa. Son and rumba clave can be played in either a triple-pulse ( or ) or duple-pulse (, or ) structure. The contemporary Cuban practice is to write the duple-pulse clave in a single measure of . It is also written in a single measure in ethnomusicological writings about African music.

Although they subdivide the beats differently, the and versions of each clave share the same pulse names. The correlation between the triple-pulse and duple-pulse forms of clave, as well as other patterns, is an important dynamic of sub-Saharan-based rhythm. Every triple-pulse pattern has its duple-pulse correlative.

Both clave patterns are used in rumba. What we now call &quot;son clave&quot; (also known as &quot;Havana clave&quot;) used to be the key pattern played in Havana-style yambú and guaguancó. Some Havana-based rumba groups still use &quot;son clave&quot; for yambú. The musical genre known as &quot;son&quot; probably adopted the clave pattern from rumba when it migrated from eastern Cuba to Havana at the beginning of the 20th century.
During the nineteenth century, African music and European music sensibilities were blended in original Cuban hybrids. Cuban popular music became the conduit through which sub-Saharan rhythmic elements were first codified within the context of European (&#x27;Western&#x27;) music theory. The first written music rhythmically based on clave was the Cuban danzón, which premiered in 1879. The contemporary concept of clave with its accompanying terminology reached its full development in Cuban popular music during the 1940s. Its application has since spread to folkloric music as well. In a sense, the Cubans standardized their myriad rhythms, both folkloric and popular, by relating nearly all of them to the clave pattern. The veiled code of African rhythm was brought to light due to the clave’s omnipresence. Consequently, the term &quot;clave&quot; has come to mean both the five-stroke pattern and the total matrix it exemplifies. In other words, the rhythmic matrix is the &quot;clave matrix&quot;. Clave is the key that unlocks the enigma; it de-codes the rhythmic puzzle. It is commonly understood that the actual clave pattern does not need to be played for the music to be &#x27;in clave&#x27;—Peñalosa (2009).

One of the most difficult applications of the clave is in the realm of composition and arrangement of Cuban and Cuban-based dance music. Regardless of the instrumentation, the music for all of the instruments of the ensemble must be written with a very keen and conscious rhythmic relationship to the clave . . . Any &#x27;breaks&#x27; and/or &#x27;stops&#x27; in the arrangements must also be &#x27;in clave&#x27;. If these procedures are not properly taken into consideration, then the music is &#x27;out of clave&#x27; which, if not done intentionally, is considered an error. When the rhythm and music are &#x27;in clave&#x27;, a great natural &#x27;swing&#x27; is produced, regardless of the tempo. All musicians who write and/or interpret Cuban-based music must be &#x27;clave conscious&#x27;, not just the percussionists—Santos (1986).
==Clave theory==
There are three main branches of what could be called &quot;clave theory&quot;.

===Cuban popular music===
First is the set of concepts and related terminology, which were created and developed in Cuban popular music from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. In &quot;Popular Cuban Music&quot;, Emilio Grenet defines in general terms how the duple-pulse clave pattern guides all members of the music ensemble. An important Cuban contribution to this branch of music theory is the concept of the clave as a musical period, which has two rhythmically opposing halves. The first half is antecedent and moving, and the second half is consequent and grounded.

===Ethnomusicological studies of African rhythm===
The second branch comes from the ethnomusicological studies of sub-Saharan African rhythm. In 1959, Arthur Morris Jones published his landmark work &quot;Studies in African Music&quot;, in which he identified the triple-pulse clave as the guide pattern for many pieces of music from ethnic groups across Africa. An important contribution of ethnomusicology to clave theory is the understanding that the clave matrix is generated by cross-rhythm.

===The 3–2/2–3 clave concept and terminology===
The third branch comes from the United States. An important North American contribution to clave theory is the worldwide propagation of the 3–2/2–3 concept and terminology, which arose from the fusion of Cuban rhythms with jazz in New York City.

Only in the last couple of decades have the three branches of clave theory begun to reconcile their shared and conflicting concepts. Thanks to the popularity of Cuban-based music and the vast amount of educational material available on the subject, many musicians today have a basic understanding of clave. Contemporary books that deal with clave, share a certain fundamental understanding of what &quot;clave&quot; means.

Chris Washburne considers the term to refer to the rules that govern the rhythms played with the claves. Bertram Lehman regards the clave as a concept with wide-ranging theoretical syntactic implications for African music in general, and for David Peñalosa, the &quot;clave matrix&quot; is a comprehensive system for organizing music—Toussaint (2013).

===Mathematical analysis===
In addition to these three branches of theory, clave has in recent years been thoroughly analyzed mathematically. The structure of clave can be understood in terms of cross-rhythmic ratios, above all, three-against-two (3:2). Godfried Toussaint, a Research Professor of Computer Science, has published a book and several papers on the mathematical analysis of clave and related African bell patterns. Toussaint uses geometry and the Euclidean algorithm as a means of exploring the significance of clave.

==Types==

===Son clave===
The most common clave pattern used in Cuban popular music is called the &quot;son clave&quot;, named after the Cuban musical genre of the same name. Clave is the basic period, composed of two rhythmically opposed cells, one antecedent and the other consequent. Clave was initially written in two measures of in Cuban music. When written this way, each cell or clave half is represented within a single measure.

====Three-side / two-side====
The antecedent half has three strokes and is called the &quot;three-side&quot; of the clave. The consequent half (second measure above) of clave has two strokes and is called the &quot;two-side&quot;.
Going only slightly into the rhythmic structure of our music we find that all its melodic design is constructed on a rhythmic pattern of two measures, as though both were only one, the first is antecedent, strong, and the second is consequent, weak—Grenet (1939).

[With] clave... the two measures are not at odds, but rather, they are balanced opposites like positive and negative, expansive and contractive or the poles of a magnet. As the pattern is repeated, an alternation from one polarity to the other takes place creating the pulse and rhythmic drive. Were the pattern to be suddenly reversed, the rhythm would be destroyed as in a reversing of one magnet within a series... the patterns are held in place according to both the internal relationships between the drums and their relationship with clave... Should the drums fall out of clave (and in contemporary practice they sometimes do) the internal momentum of the rhythm will be dissipated and perhaps even broken—Amira and Cornelius (1992).

====Tresillo====
In Cuban popular music, the first three strokes of son clave are also known collectively as &quot;tresillo&quot;, a Spanish word meaning triplet i.e. three almost equal beats in the same time as two main beats. However, in the vernacular of Cuban popular music, the term refers to the figure shown here.

===Rumba clave===
The other main clave pattern is the &quot;rumba clave&quot;. Rumba clave is the key pattern used in Cuban rumba. The use of the triple-pulse form of the rumba clave in Cuba can be traced back to the iron bell (&quot;ekón&quot;) part in abakuá music. The form of rumba known as &quot;columbia&quot; is culturally and musically connected with abakuá which is an Afro Cuban cabildo that descends from the Kalabari of Cameroon. Columbia also uses this pattern. Sometimes rumba clave is clapped in the accompaniment of Cuban batá drums. The form of rumba clave is used in yambú, guaguancó and popular music.

There is some debate as to how the rumba clave should be notated for guaguancó and yambú. In actual practice, the third stroke on the three-side and the first stroke on the two-side often fall in rhythmic positions that do not fit neatly into music notation. Triple-pulse strokes can be substituted for duple-pulse strokes. Also, the clave strokes are sometimes displaced in such a way that they don&#x27;t fall within either a triple-pulse or duple-pulse &quot;grid&quot;. Therefore, many variations are possible.

The first regular use of the rumba clave in Cuban popular music began with the&quot; mozambique&quot;, created by Pello el Afrikan in the early 1960s. When used in popular music (such as songo, timba or Latin jazz) rumba clave can be perceived in either a 3–2 or 2–3 sequence.

===Standard bell pattern===
The seven-stroke &quot;standard bell pattern&quot; contains the strokes of both clave patterns. Some North American musicians call this pattern &quot;clave&quot;. Other North American musicians refer to the triple-pulse form as the &quot; bell&quot; because they write the pattern in two measures of .

Like clave, the standard pattern is expressed in both triple and duple-pulse. The standard pattern has strokes on:
1, 1a, 2&amp; 2a, 3&amp;, 4, 4a.
 1 &amp; a 2 &amp; a 3 &amp; a 4 &amp; a ||
 X . X . X X . X . X . X ||
 1 e &amp; a 2 e &amp; a 3 e &amp; a 4 e &amp; a ||
 X . . X . . X X . . X . X . . X ||

The ethnomusicologist A.M. Jones observes that what we call &quot;son clave, rumba clave&quot;, and the &quot;standard pattern&quot; are the most commonly used key patterns (also called &quot;bell patterns, timeline patterns&quot; and &quot;guide patterns&quot;) in Sub-Saharan African music traditions and he considers all three to be basically &quot;the same pattern&quot;. Clearly, they are all expressions of the same rhythmic principles. The three key patterns are found within a large geographic belt extending from Mali in northwest Africa to Mozambique in southeast Africa.

==&quot; clave&quot; as used by North American musicians==
In Afro-Cuban folkloric genres the triple-pulse ( or ) rumba clave is the archetypal form of the guide pattern. Even when the drums are playing in duple-pulse (), as in guaguancó, the clave is often played with displaced strokes that are closer to triple-pulse than duple-pulse. John Santos states: &quot;The proper feel of this [rumba clave] rhythm, is closer to triple [pulse].”

Conversely, in salsa and Latin jazz, especially as played in North America, is the basic framework and is considered something of a novelty and in some cases, an enigma. The cross-rhythmic structure (multiple beat schemes) is frequently misunderstood to be metrically ambiguous. North American musicians often refer to Afro-Cuban rhythm as a &quot;feel&quot;, a term usually reserved for those aspects of musical nuance not practically suited for analysis. As used by North American musicians, &quot; clave&quot; can refer to one of three types of triple-pulse key patterns.

===Triple-pulse standard pattern===
When one hears triple-pulse rhythms in Latin jazz the percussion is most often replicating the Afro-Cuban rhythm bembé. The standard bell is the key pattern used in bembé and so with compositions based on triple-pulse rhythms, it is the seven-stroke bell, rather than the five-stroke clave that is the most familiar to jazz musicians. Consequently, some North American musicians refer to the triple-pulse standard pattern as &quot; clave&quot;.

===Triple-pulse rumba clave===
Some refer to the triple-pulse form of rumba clave as &quot; clave&quot;. When rumba clave is written in the four underlying main beats are counted: 1, 2, 1, 2.

 1 &amp; a 2 &amp; a |1 &amp; a 2 &amp; a ||
 X . X . . X |. X . X . . ||

Claves... are not usually played in Afro-Cuban feels... [and] the clave [pattern] is not traditionally played in though it may be helpful to do so to relate the clave to the bell pattern—Thress (1994).The main exceptions are: the form of rumba known as Columbia, and some performances of abakuá by rumba groups, where the rumba clave pattern is played on claves.

===Triple-pulse son clave===
Triple-pulse son clave is the least common form of clave used in Cuban music. It is, however, found across an enormously vast area of sub-Saharan Africa. The first published example (1920) of this pattern identified it as a hand-clap part accompanying a song from Mozambique.

==Cross-rhythm and the correct metric structure==
Because clave-based music is generated from cross-rhythm, it is possible to count or feel the clave in several different ways. The ethnomusicologist Arthur Morris Jones correctly identified the importance of this key pattern, but he mistook its accents as indicators of meter rather than the counter-metric phenomena they are. Similarly, while Anthony King identified the triple-pulse &quot;son clave&quot; as &quot;the ‘standard pattern’ in its simplest and most basic form&quot;, he did not correctly identify its metric structure. King represented the pattern in a polymetric time signature.

It wasn&#x27;t until African musicologists like C.K. Ladzekpo entered into the discussion in the 1970s and 80s that the metric structure of sub-Saharan rhythm was unambiguously defined. The writings of Victor Kofi Agawu and David Locke must also be mentioned in this regard.

In the diagram below (son) clave is shown on top and a beat cycle is shown below it. Any or all of these structures may be the emphasis at a given point in a piece of music using the &quot; clave&quot;.

The example on the left () represents the correct count and ground of the &quot; clave&quot;. The four dotted quarter-notes across the two bottom measures are the main beats. All clave patterns are built upon four main beats. The bottom measures on the other two examples ( and ) show cross-beats. Observing the dancer&#x27;s steps almost always reveals the main beats of the music. Because the main beats are usually emphasized in the steps and not the music, it is often difficult for an &quot;outsider&quot; to feel the proper metric structure without seeing the dance component. Kubik states: &quot;To understand the emotional structure of any music in Africa, one has to look at the dancers as well and see how they relate to the instrumental background&quot; (2010: 78).

==3–2/2–3 clave concept and terminology==
In Cuban popular music, a chord progression can begin on either side of the clave. When the progression begins on the three-side, the song or song section is said to be in 3–2 clave. When the chord progression begins on the two-side, it is in 2–3 claves. In North America, salsa and Latin jazz charts commonly represent clave in two measures of cut-time (); this is most likely the influence of jazz conventions. When clave is written in two measures (right), changing from one clave sequence to the other is a matter of reversing the order of the measures.

===Chord progression begins on the three-side (3–2)===
A guajeo is a typical Cuban ostinato melody, most often consisting of arpeggiated chords in syncopated patterns. Guajeos are a seamless blend of European harmonic and African rhythmic structures. Most guajeos have a binary structure that expresses clave.

====Clave motif====

Kevin Moore states: &quot;There are two common ways that the three-side is expressed in Cuban popular music. The first to come into regular use, which David Peñalosa calls &#x27;clave motif,&#x27; is based on the decorated version of the three-side of the clave rhythm.&quot; The following guajeo example is based on a clave motif. The three-side (first measure) consists of the tresillo variant known as cinquillo.

Since this chord progression begins on the three-side, the song or song section is said to be in 3–2 clave.

====Offbeat/onbeat motif====

Moore: &quot;By the 1940s [there was] a trend toward the use of what Peñalosa calls the &#x27;offbeat/onbeat motif.&#x27; Today, the offbeat/onbeat motif method is much more common.&quot; With this type of guajeo motif, the three-side of clave is expressed with all offbeats. The following I–IV–V–IV progression is in a 3–2 clave sequence. It begins with an offbeat pick-up on the pulse immediately before beat 1. With some guajeos, offbeats at the end of the two-side, or beats at the end of the three-side serve as pick-ups leading into the next measure (when clave is written in two measures).

===Chord progression begins on the two-side (2–3)===

====Clave motif====

A chord progression can begin on either side of the clave. One can, therefore, be on either the three-side or the two-side because the harmonic progression, rather than the rhythmic progression, is the primary referent. The following guajeo is based on the clave motif in a 2–3 sequence. The cinquillo rhythm is now in the second measure.

====Onbeat/offbeat motif====

This guajeo is in 2–3 clave because it begins on the downbeat, emphasizing the onbeat quality of the two-side. The figure has the same harmonic sequence as the earlier offbeat/onbeat example, but rhythmically, the attack-point sequence of the two measures is reversed. Most salsa is in 2–3 clave and most salsa piano guajeos are based on the 2–3 onbeat/offbeat motif.

===Going from one side of clave to the other within the same song===
The 3–2/2–3 concept and terminology was developed in New York City during the 1940s by Cuban-born Mario Bauza while he was the music director of Machito and his Afro-Cubans. Bauzá was a master at moving the song from one side of the clave to the other.

The following melodic excerpt is taken from the opening verses of &quot;Que vengan los rumberos&quot; by Machito and his Afro-Cubans. Notice that the melody goes from one side of clave to the other and then back again. A measure of moves the chord progression from the two-side (2–3) to the three-side (3–2). Later, another measure of moves the start of the chord progression back to two-side (2–3).

According to David Peñalosa:

Tito Puente learned the concept from Bauzá. Tito Puente&#x27;s &quot;Philadelphia Mambo&quot; is an example of a song that moves from one side of clave to the other. The technique eventually became a staple of composing and arranging in salsa and Latin jazz. According to Kevin Moore:

Cuban folkloric musicians do not use the 3–2/2–3 system. Many Cuban performers of popular music do not use it either. The great Cuban conga player and bandleader Mongo Santamaría said, &quot;Don’t tell me about 3–2 or 2–3! In Cuba, we just play. We feel it, we don’t talk about such things.&quot; In another book, Santamaría said, &quot;In Cuba, we don’t think about [clave]. We know that we’re in a clave. Because we know that we have to be in clave to be a musician.&quot; According to Cuban pianist Sonny Bravo, the late Charlie Palmieri would insist that &quot;There’s no such thing as 3–2 or 2–3, there’s only one clave!&quot; The contemporary Cuban bassist, composer and arranger Alain Pérez flatly states: &quot;In Cuba, we do not use that 2–3, 3–2 formula... 2–3, 3–2 [is] not used in Cuba. That is how people learn Cuban music outside Cuba.&quot;

==In non-Cuban music==

===Controversy over use and origins===

The musical usage and historical origins of the clave are debated. This section presents examples from non-Cuban music, which some musicians hold to be representative of the clave. The most common claims, those of Brazilian and subsets of American popular music, are described below.

===In Africa===

====A widely used bell pattern====
&quot;Clave&quot; is a Spanish word and its musical usage as a pattern played on claves was developed in the western part of Cuba, particularly the cities of Matanzas and Havana. Some writings have claimed that the clave patterns originated in Cuba. One frequently repeated theory is that the triple-pulse African bell patterns morphed into duple-pulse forms as a result of the influence of European musical sensibilities. &quot;The duple meter feel [of rumba clave] may have been the result of the influence of marching bands and other Spanish styles...&quot;— Washburne (1995).

However, the duple-pulse forms have existed in sub-Saharan Africa for centuries. The patterns the Cubans call &quot;clave&quot; are two of the most common bell parts used in Sub-Saharan African music traditions. Natalie Curtis, A.M. Jones, Anthony King and John Collins document the triple-pulse forms of what we call “son clave” and “rumba clave” in West, Central, and East Africa. Francis Kofi and C.K. Ladzekpo document several Ghanaian rhythms that use the triple or duple-pulse forms of &quot;son clave&quot;. Percussion scholar royal hartigan identifies the duple-pulse form of &quot;rumba clave&quot; as a timeline pattern used by the Yoruba and Ibo of Nigeria, West Africa. He states that this pattern is also found in the high-pitched boat-shaped iron bell known as atoke played in the Akpese music of the Eve people of Ghana. There are many recordings of traditional African music where one can hear the five-stroke &quot;clave&quot; used as a bell pattern.

====Popular dance music====
Cuban music has been popular in sub-Saharan Africa since the mid-twentieth century. To the Africans, clave-based Cuban popular music sounded both familiar and exotic. Congolese bands started doing Cuban covers and singing the lyrics phonetically. Soon, they were creating their original Cuban-like compositions, with lyrics sung in French or Lingala, a lingua franca of the western Congo region. The Congolese called this new music &quot;rumba&quot;, although it was based on the son. The Africans adapted guajeos to electric guitars and gave them their regional flavor. The guitar-based music gradually spread out from the Congo, increasingly taking on local sensibilities. This process eventually resulted in the establishment of several different distinct regional genres, such as soukous.

=====Soukous=====
The following soukous bass line is an embellishment of clave.

Banning Eyre distills down the Congolese guitar style to this skeletal figure, where clave is sounded by the bass notes (notated with downward stems).

=====Highlife=====
Highlife was the most popular genre in Ghana and Nigeria during the 1960s. This arpeggiated highlife guitar part is essentially a guajeo. The rhythmic pattern is known in Cuba as &quot;baqueteo&quot;. The pattern of attack-points is nearly identical to the 3–2 &quot;clave motif&quot; guajeo shown earlier in this article. The bell pattern known in Cuba as &quot;clave&quot;, is indigenous to Ghana and Nigeria, and is used in highlife.

=====Afrobeat=====
The following afrobeat guitar part is a variant of the 2–3 &quot;onbeat/offbeat motif&quot;. Even the melodic contour is guajeo-based. 2–3 claves are shown above the guitar for reference only. The clave pattern is not ordinarily played in afrobeat.

===Guide-patterns in Cuban versus non-Cuban music===
There is some debate as to whether or not clave, as it appears in Cuban music, functions in the same way as its sister rhythms in other forms of music (Brazilian, North American and African). Certain forms of Cuban music demand a strict relationship between the clave and other musical parts, even across genres. This same structural relationship between the guide-pattern and the rest of the ensemble is easily observed in many sub-Saharan rhythms, as well as rhythms from Haiti and Brazil. However, the 3–2/2–3 concept and terminology are limited to certain types of Cuban-based popular music and are not used in the music of Africa, Haiti, Brazil or in Afro-Cuban folkloric music. In American pop music, the clave pattern tends to be used as an element of rhythmic color, rather than a guide-pattern and as such is superimposed over many types of rhythms.

===In Brazilian music===
Both Cuba and Brazil imported Yoruba, Fon and Congolese slaves. Therefore, it is not surprising that we find the bell pattern the Cubans call &quot;clave&quot; in the Afro-Brazilian music of Macumba and Maculelê (dance). &quot;Son clave&quot; and &quot;rumba clave&quot; are also used as a tamborim part in some batucada arrangements. The structure of Afro-Brazilian bell patterns can be understood in terms of the &quot;clave concept&quot; (see below). Although a few contemporary Brazilian musicians have adopted the 3–2/2–3 terminology, it is traditionally not a part of the Brazilian rhythmic concept.

Bell pattern 1 is used in maculelê (dance) and some Candomblé and Macumba rhythms. Pattern 1 is known in Cuba as &quot;son clave&quot;. Bell 2 is used in afoxê and can be thought of as pattern 1 embellished with four additional strokes. Bell 3 is used in batucada. Pattern 4 is the maracatu bell and can be thought of as pattern 1 embellished with four additional strokes.

====Bossa nova pattern====
The so-called &quot;bossa nova clave&quot; (or &quot;Brazilian clave&quot;) has a similar rhythm to that of the son clave, but the second note on the two-side is delayed by one pulse (subdivision). The rhythm is typically played as a snare rim pattern in bossa nova music. The pattern is shown below in , as it is written in Brazil. In North American charts it is more likely to be written in cut-time.

According to drummer Bobby Sanabria the Brazilian composer Antonio Carlos Jobim, who developed the pattern, considers it to be merely a rhythmic motif and not a clave (guide pattern). Jobim later regretted that Latino musicians misunderstood the role of this bossa nova pattern.

====Other Brazilian examples====
The examples below are transcriptions of several patterns resembling the Cuban clave that is found in various styles of Brazilian music, on the ago-gô and surdo instruments.

Legend: Time signature: ; L=low bell, H=high bell, O = open surdo hit, X = muffled surdo hit, and | divides the measure:

* Style: Samba 3:2; codice_1 (More common 3:2: codice_2)
* Style: Maracatu 3:2; codice_3
* Style: Samba 3:2; codice_4
* Instrument: 3rd Surdo 2:3; codice_5
* Variation of samba style: Partido Alto 2:3; codice_6
* Style: Maracatu 2:3; codice_7
* Style: Samba-Reggae or Bossanova 3:2; codice_8
* Style: Ijexa 3:2; codice_9 (codice_10)

For 3rd example above, the clave pattern is based on a common accompaniment pattern played by the guitarist. B=bass note played by guitarist&#x27;s thumb, C=chord played by fingers.
 &amp;|1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;|1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;||
 C|B C . C B . C .|B . C . B C . C||

The singer enters on the wrong side of the clave and the ago-gô player adjusts accordingly. This recording cuts off the first bar so that it sounds like the bell comes in on the third beat of the second bar. This is suggestive of a pre-determined rhythmic relationship between the vocal part and the percussion and supports the idea of a clave-like structure in Brazilian music.

===In Jamaican and French Caribbean music===
The son clave rhythm is present in Jamaican mento music, and can be heard on 1950s-era recordings such as &quot;Don’t Fence Her In&quot;, &quot;Green Guava&quot; or &quot;Limbo&quot; by Lord Tickler, &quot;Mango Time&quot; by Count Lasher, &quot;Linstead Market/Day O&quot; by The Wigglers, &quot;Bargie&quot; by The Tower Islanders, &quot;Nebuchanezer&quot; by Laurel Aitken and others. The Jamaican population is part of the same origin (Congo) as many Cubans, which perhaps explains the shared rhythm. It is also heard frequently in Martinique&#x27;s biguine and Dominica&#x27;s Jing ping. Just as likely however is the possibility that claves and the clave rhythm spread to Jamaica, Trinidad and the other small islands of the Caribbean through the popularity of Cuban son recordings from the 1920s onward.

===Experimental clave music===

====Art music====
The clave rhythm and clave concept have been used in some modern art music (&quot;classical&quot;) compositions. &quot;Rumba Clave&quot; by Cuban percussion virtuoso Roberto Vizcaiño has been performed in recital halls around the world. Another clave-based composition that has &quot;gone global&quot; is the snare drum suite &quot;Cross&quot; by Eugene D. Novotney.

====Odd meter &quot;clave&quot;====

Technically speaking, the term &quot;odd meter clave&quot; is an oxymoron. Clave consists of two even halves, in a divisive structure of four main beats. However, in recent years jazz musicians from Cuba and outside of Cuba have been experimenting with creating new &quot;claves&quot; and related patterns in various odd meters. Clave which is traditionally used in a divisive rhythm structure, has inspired many new creative inventions in an additive rhythm context.

. . . I developed the concept of adjusting claves to other time signatures, with varying degrees of success. What became obvious to me quite quickly was that the closer I stuck to the general rules of clave the more natural the pattern sounded. Clave has a natural flow with a certain tension and resolves points. I found if I kept these points in the new meters they could still flow seamlessly, allowing me to play longer phrases. It also gave me many reference points and reduced my reliance on &quot;one&quot;—Guilfoyle (2006: 10).

<doc id="274932" wikidata="Q4501450" url="?curid=274932" title="Christian demonology">
<text>Christian demonology is the study of demons from a Christian point of view. It is primarily based on the Bible (Old and New Testaments), the interpretation of these scriptures, the writings of early Christianity philosophers, hermits, and the associated traditions and legends incorporated from other beliefs.

==Origins==

In some Christian traditions, the deities of other religions are interpreted as demons. Paul states this explicitly in 1 Corinthians 10, forbidding idolatrous libations. The evolution of the Devil in Christianity is such an example of early ritual and imagery that showcase evil qualities, as seen by the Christian churches.

Since Early Christianity, demonology has developed from a simple acceptance of the existence of demons to a complex study that has grown from the original ideas taken from Jewish demonology and Christian scriptures. Christian demonology is studied in depth within the Roman Catholic Church, although many other Christian churches affirm and discuss the existence of demons.

The Catholic Encyclopedia, referring to the many false beliefs and erroneous teachings on the subject, says of demonology, &quot;&quot; ().

According to the Book of Enoch (which is currently only canonical in the Eritrean and Ethiopian Orthodox Churches but was referred to by the early Church fathers), the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim are demons. Enoch explains:
==Number==
In 1467, Alonso de Espina asserted that the number of demons was 133,316,666. This idea that one third of the angels turned into demons seems to be due to an eisegesis of the Book of Revelation 12:3–9.

Johann Weyer, in his &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; (1583), after a complicated system of hierarchies and calculations, estimated the number of demons as 4,439,622, divided into 666 legions, each legion composed of 6,666 demons, and all of them ruled by 66 hellish dukes, princes, kings, etc. &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (17th century) copied the division into legions from &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; but added more demons, and so more legions. It is suggestive that both Spina and Weyer used &quot;666&quot; and other numbers composed by more than one &quot;6&quot; to calculate the number of demons (133,316,666 demons, 666 legions, 6,666 demons in each legion, 66 rulers).
Therefore, the demonic number was 666.
Gregory of Nyssa, in the 4th century, believed in the existence of male and female demons and supported the idea that demons procreated with other demons and with human women. Other scholars supported the idea that they could not procreate and that the number of demons was constant.

==Characteristics==

In Christian tradition, demons are fallen angels and have the same characteristics as their good angel counterparts: spirituality, immutability and immortality. Demons are not omniscient, but each one has a specific knowledge (sometimes on more than one subject). Their power is limited to that which God allows, so they are not omnipotent. No reference has been made about omnipresence, so it is unclear if they can be in different places at the same time, but according to the tradition of the medieval witches&#x27; Sabbath, two conclusions can be reached: either the Devil can be in different places at the same time, or he sends an emissary in his name.

Christian demonology states that the mission of the demons is to induce humans to sin. Demons are also believed to try to tempt people into abandoning the faith, committing heresy or apostasy, remaining or turning into Pagans, or venerating idols (the Christian term for cult images). It is also believed that demons torment people during their life or through demonic possession or simply by showing themselves before persons to frighten them or by provoking visions that could induce people to sin or to be afraid.

In the Gospel of Luke, it is stated that demons walk &quot;arid places&quot;, and finding no rest return to their previous home.

===Appearance===
Demons can take any desired appearance, even that of an &quot;angel of light&quot;.
Nevertheless, they were generally described as ugly and monstrous beings by Christian demonologists. Many of these descriptions have inspired famous painters like Luca Signorelli, Hieronymus Bosch, Francisco Goya, the artist who made the drawings for the , and others. Incubi and succubi are described as looking attractive in order to accomplish their mission of seduction.The Devil in particular has been popularly symbolized as various animals, including the serpent, the goat and the dragon.

The idea that demons have horns seems to have been taken from chapter 13 of the Book of Revelation.


This idea has also been associated with the depiction of certain ancient gods like Moloch and the shedu, which were portrayed as bulls, as men with the head of a bull, or wearing bull horns as a crown.
In &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;, Heinrich Kramer wrote that demons can take the form of children, and that in this form, they are very heavy, constantly ill and do not grow.

Poets such as Geoffrey Chaucer associated the color green with the Devil, although in modern times the color is red.

Henry Boguet and some English demonologists of the same epoch asserted that witches and warlocks confessed (under torture) that demons&#x27; bodies were icy. During the 17th century, this belief prevailed.

===Sexuality===

Demons are generally considered sexless as they have no physical bodies, but different kinds are generally associated with one sex or another. Many theologians agreed that demons acted first as succubi to collect sperm from men and then as incubi to put it into a woman&#x27;s vagina.

Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas wrote that demons and the hierarchy of angels are created by God with the same non–material substance. Because they have no bodies they have no sexual identity and can not generate human beings or other angels. The incorporeality is related to their nature, eternal and unchangeable across the centuries.

Ulrich Molitor and Nicholas Remy disagreed whether women could be impregnated by demons. Remy thought that a woman could never be fecundated by any being other than a man. Heinrich Kramer (author of the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;) adopted an intermediate position; he wrote that demons acted first as succubi and then as incubi, but added the possibility that succubi could receive semen from incubi, but he considered that this sperm could not fecundate women.

Peter of Paluda and Martin of Arles among others supported the idea that demons could take sperm from dead men and impregnate women. Some demonologists thought that demons could take semen from dying or recently deceased men, and thus dead men should be buried as soon as possible to avoid it.

==Possession==
The incarnation of the demons has been a problem in Christian demonology and theology since early times. A very early form of the incarnation of demons was the idea of demonic possession, trying to explain that a demon entered the body of a person with some purpose or simply to punish that one for some allegedly committed sin. This soon acquired greater proportions, trying to explain how demons could seduce people to have sexual relationships with them or induce them to commit other sins. To Christian scholars, demons did not always have to manifest themselves in a visible and possible tangible form, sometimes it was through possession.

According to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke demons could be seen and heard, as well as banished.



Basil of Caesarea also wrote on this subject. He believed that demons, to materialize, had to condense vapors and with them form the body of a person or animal, then entering that body as if it were a puppet to which they gave life. Henry More supported this idea, saying that their bodies were cold due to the solidification of water vapor to form them. Many authors believed that demons could assume the shape of an animal.

Raoul Glaber, a monk of Saint-Léger, Belgium, seems to have been the first in writing about the visit of a demon of horrible aspect in his &quot;Historiarum sui temporis, Libri quinque&quot; (History of his Time in Five Books).

Augustine thought that demons often were imaginary, but sometimes could enter human bodies, but later accepted the idea of the materialization of demons. Thomas Aquinas followed Augustine&#x27;s idea, but added that demonic materialization had sexual connotations because demons tried to seduce people to commit sexual sins.

Ambrogio de Vignati, disagreeing with other authors, asserted that demons, besides not having a material body, could not create one, and all what they seemed to do was a mere hallucination provoked by them in the mind of those who had made a diabolical pact or were &quot;victims&quot; of a succubus or incubus, including the sexual act.

==Diabolical symbols==
Inspired by the Revelation 13:18, the number 666 (the number of the second beast) was attributed to the Antichrist and to the Devil.

According to medieval grimoires, demons each have a diabolical signature or seal with which they sign diabolical pacts. These seals can also be used by a conjurer to summon and control the demons. The seals of a variety of demons are given in grimoires such as The Great Book of Saint Cyprian, Le Dragon Rouge and The Lesser Key of Solomon.

The pentagram, which has been used with various meanings in many cultures (including Christianity, in which it denoted the five wounds of Christ), is usually considered a diabolical sign when inverted (one point downwards, two points up). Such a symbol may appear with or without a surrounding circle, and sometimes contains the head of a male goat, with the horns fitting into the upper points of the star, the ears into the side points, the beard into the lowest one, and the face into the central pentagon.

An inverted (upside-down) cross (particularly the crucifix) has also been considered a symbol of both the Devil and the Antichrist, although in Catholic tradition a plain inverted cross (without the corpus or figure of Christ) is a symbol of Saint Peter.

==Other views==

Not all Christians believe that demons exist in the literal sense. There is the view that the New Testament language of exorcism is an example of the language of the day being employed to describe the healings of what today would be classified as epilepsy, mental illness etc.
