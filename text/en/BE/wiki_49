<text>Hoofddorp (; ) is the main town of the municipality of Haarlemmermeer, in the province of North Holland, the Netherlands. In 2021, the population was 77,885. The town was founded in 1853, immediately after the Haarlemmermeer had been drained.

== History ==
After the draining of the Haarlemmermeer, two villages, Kruisdorp (Crossvillage) and Venneperdorp (Vennepervillage), were founded in the centre of the polder. In 1868, they were renamed to Hoofddorp, as there already was another Kruisdorp in Zeeland, and Nieuw-Vennep respectively. Hoofddorp became more prosperous than Nieuw-Vennep, and it rapidly became the most important place of the district.

== Landmarks ==
Hoofddorp is a relatively young town and therefore has few historical buildings. In 2008, Hoofddorp had 26 municipal, provincial and national monuments.

In the late nineteenth century Hoofddorp was included in the Defense Line of Amsterdam. A fort was built next to the main canal, two batteries were located in what are now the outskirts of Hoofddorp, and several casemates were built to the east of Hoofddorp. A large dike known as the &quot;Geniedijk&quot; (Engineers&#x27; dike) connected the fort at Hoofddorp to the batteries and the casemates, and ultimately to the fort at Vijfhuizen in the west and the fort at Aalsmeer in the east.

Hoofddorp has nine national monuments. The mill De Eersteling on the Hoofdweg is a round corn mill from 1856 and was built in the centre of Hoofddorp by Dirk David van Dijk. It was called &quot;De Eersteling&quot; (literally translated&quot;The First&quot;). Due to increased building around the mill it eventually fell into disuse.. It was originally located on the Kruisweg in the old centre of Hoofddorp, but was moved in its entirety by trailer in 1977 and is now located near Fort Hoofddorp. It has operated regularly from that time and is now open to the public.

The Witte Boerderij on the Hoofdweg is a kop-rompboerderij from 1860 and is a good example of a Haarlemmermeer farm from the early days of the polder. The Witte Boerderij is now home to the &quot;Stichting Meer-Historie&quot;.

Other monuments include the Old Town Hall from 1867, the District Court from 1911 and the Polderhuis of the Haarlemmermeer from 1913. The latter was built to a design by architect Foeke Kuipers in a historicizing architectural style that harks back to 17th-century Dutch classicism. Another monument is Marktzicht, formerly the center of Hoofddorp&#x27;s market activities.

The Geniedijk runs through Hoofddorp, part of the Defense Line of Amsterdam. This defense line is on the World Heritage List of UNESCO. Fort Hoofddorp is located in that dike.


=== Historical Museum ===
The &quot;Historical Museum Haarlemmermeer&quot; can be found on the Bosweg (ex-Kruisweg). The museum has all sorts of things to find about the history of the Haarlemmermeer. Among other things, it has objects related to the draining. The museum is located in part of the old Mentzhoeve farm. This farm from 1860 resembles a Limburg farm in the sense that all the buildings were built around a courtyard. The Mentzhoeve is the only farm of this type in the Haarlemmermeer.

== Transport ==
The town is served by Hoofddorp railway station. In the 2020 timetable there are 4 trains an hour to Leiden (weekdays), 4 trains an hour to Amsterdam Zuid railway station, 2 trains an hour to Zaandam, and 4 trains an hour to Amsterdam Centraal. Journey times to Amsterdam Centraal are 25 – 30 minutes.

On 3 August 1912, Hoofddorp was connected by rail to Leiden, Aalsmeer and Haarlem. These railway lines, operated by the (HESM), were closed on 31 December 1935.

In 1981, Hoofddorp was connected by rail for the second time, this time to Leiden and Schiphol Airport as a part of the Schiphollijn. The Southern High-Speed Line, that opened in 2007, will use existing conventional track from Amsterdam Central Station to Hoofddorp, where it will branch off onto a dedicated track. The trains will not stop at Hoofddorp.

On 30 November 1992 the Hoofddorp train disaster took place near Hoofddorp, causing 5 deaths and 33 wounded.

Hoofddorp is connected by many bus lines to many cities and towns in the immediate surroundings. Most bus lines are operated by Connexxion. In 2002, Hoofddorp was connected to Haarlem, Schiphol Airport and Amsterdam Zuidoost by the high quality bus line Zuidtangent. In 2009 came the Second line from Amsterdam Zuid railway station to Nieuw Vennep . The Zuidtangent will be expanded by adding a line to Uithoorn and Amsterdam IJburg.

The bus station at Spaarne Hospital in Hoofddorp is the world&#x27;s biggest structure built entirely from synthetic materials: factory-cut polystyrene foam with a polyester skin. At this moment it has been painted in a sort of orange colour. However, the municipality has decided to remove the structure because of high maintenance costs.

In January 2019, CEO of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol Dick Benschop announced that agreements had been reached to extend the Amsterdam Metro&#x27;s North-South line to the airport and Hoofddorp.

== Government and infrastructure ==
The Netherlands Aviation Safety Board, during its existence, had its head office in Hoofddorp. The Dutch Transport Safety Board, the successor agency, was established on 1 July 1999 and the Netherlands Aviation Safety Board was merged into the agency at that time.

== Private transport ==
Hoofddorp is well connected to several of the main roads in the Netherlands. At , the A5 motorway branches off to Haarlem from the A4 motorway that leads to Amsterdam and The Hague. The A9 motorway can easily be reached via Badhoevedorp or the junction of the A4 and A9 at .

Hoofddorp itself lies on the crossing of the two main secondary roads in Haarlemmermeer: the N201 from Hilversum to Zandvoort and the N520, that runs alongside the main canal of the Haarlemmermeer and dissects the polder from north to south. The suburb of &quot;Toolenburg&quot; is connected to an as yet to be developed industrial area by the bridge &quot;Lute&quot;, which was designed by architect Santiago Calatrava as part of a series of 3 bridges over the main canal along the N520. The secondary road N205 connects Nieuw Vennep to Haarlem and is part of the ring around Hoofddorp; the N201 also forms part of the ring.

<text>Emmeloord is the administrative centre of the municipality of Noordoostpolder, Flevoland, Netherlands. In 2019, it had a population of 26,055.

== Overview ==

At the heart of the Noordoostpolder, where the three main drainage canals Lemstervaart, Urkervaart and Zwolsevaart intersect, is the city of Emmeloord (1943). Named after an abandoned village on the island of Schokland, Emmeloord is located in a polder: land reclaimed from the IJsselmeer, which earlier was part of the sea. Planned from the outset to be the first and the only major town of the polder, it is the local government and services centre.

The first district built was called the Onkruidbuurt (&quot;weed neighbourhood&quot;). Street names were chosen from the weeds that were growing all around on the former sea floor, like reed (Rietstraat), thistle (Distelstraat) and sea aster (Zeeasterstraat).

From Emmeloord three main canals take their water to three pumping stations: the &quot;Buma&quot; near Lemmer (north), the &quot;Smeenge&quot; at Vollenhove (south-east) and the &quot;Vissering&quot; on Urk (south-west).

In the center of Emmeloord there is a 65 meter tall water tower called the Poldertoren. The tower is the central point of the Noordoostpolder and could be seen from almost every location in the early years of the Noordoostpolder, when there were no tall trees. In Japan there is a replica of this water tower.

== Surrounding villages ==
Ten smaller villages, conceived more as agricultural communities, were planned in a wide circle around Emmeloord, with the distances between them determined to be easily reachable by bicycle. In order from first to last, these settlements were Marknesse (1946), Ens (1948), Kraggenburg (1948), Luttelgeest 1950, Bant (1951), Rutten (1952), Creil (1953), Nagele (1954), Espel (1956) and finally Tollebeek (1956).

== Transportation ==
There is no railway station in Emmeloord, but good bus connections exist to the nearest stations. Only relevant rail connections are mentioned in below table:

The connection with Heerenveen, Drachten and Groningen is ensured by Arriva Qliner intercity buses.

Emmeloord lies at the intersection of the A6 motorway and the N50 dual carriageway, providing a rapid connection to Amsterdam, Zwolle and Friesland.

<text>Oradea (, , ; ; ) is a city in Romania, located in the Crișana region. The seat of Bihor County, Oradea is the economic, social, and cultural center for northwestern Romania. It lies between hills on the Crișana plain, on both banks of the Crișul Repede river.

Oradea is located about from Borș, a main crossing point on Romania&#x27;s border with Hungary. Oradea is the ninth most populous Romanian city (as of 2021). It covers between the Apuseni Mountains and the Crișana-Banat plain.

The city has a high standard of living and ranks among the most livable cities in the country. It is a major regional industrial center and economic hub, hosting some of Romania&#x27;s largest companies. It also boasts striking Art Nouveau architecture and is a member of the Réseau Art Nouveau Network and the Art Nouveau European Route.

==Name==
The Romanian name &quot;Oradea&quot; originates from the city&#x27;s Hungarian name &quot;Nagyvárad&quot;, colloquially shortened to &quot;Várad&quot;. &quot;Nagyvárad&quot; means &quot; &quot; or &quot;great citadel&quot; in Hungarian, contrasting with the Hungarian town of Kisvárda (small castle). The Hungarian suffix or &quot;-da&quot; is used for settlement names.

The city also has a German name, &quot;Großwardein&quot;, with a Yiddish version, גרױסװאַרדײן (&quot;Groysvardeyn)&quot;. Other historical names include Turkish &quot;Varat&quot; or &quot;Varad&quot;, Latin &quot;Varadinum&quot;, and Italian &quot;Gran Varadino&quot;, as well as Romanian &quot;Oradia&quot;, &quot;Oradea Mare&quot; (&quot;Great Oradea&quot;), &quot;Varadia Mare&quot; (&quot;Great Varadia&quot;) and &quot;Urbea Mare&quot; (&quot;the Grand City&quot;).

==Geography==
The city lies at the junction of the Crișana plain and the Crișul Repede river basin. It sits 126 meters (413 feet) above sea level, bordered to the northeast by the hills of Oradea, part of the Șes hills. The main part of the settlement lies in the floodplain and on the terraces situated along the river Crișul Repede. Oradea is famous for its thermal springs. The river Crișul Repede flows through the center of the city. Its flow depends on the season; the dykes near Tileagd have partly controlled its floodwaters since the early 1980s.

===Climate===
Oradea has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with oceanic influences. Summers are long and hot with cool nights. Winters are short and moderately cold. The city&#x27;s topo-climatic action is determined by the prevailing Western winds. 

Annual average temperature is . In July, the average is about , while in January, the average is . Rainfall is sufficient for the woods and vegetation of the zone, registering an annual average of about . Rainfall is variably distributed throughout the year, with a maximum in June and a minimum in the late Autumn and Winter months of the year.
==History==

While modern Oradea is first mentioned in 1113, under the Latin name &quot;Varadinum&quot; in a diploma belonging to Benedictine Zobor Abbey, archaeological findings around the city provide evidence of more or less continuous habitation since the Neolithic age, including Dacian and Celtic settlement. After the conquest of Dacia, the Romans built in the area, most notably in the Salca district of the city and Băile Felix. According to the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, a Hungarian chronicle written after 1150 by an author referred to as Anonymus, the region was ruled by Menumorut in the late 9th and early 10th centuries, until the Hungarian conquest. Its citadel was centred at Biharea. Historians debate whether Menumorut was a historical ruler or merely legendary. According to Anonymus, Menumorut&#x27;s duchy was populated primarily by Khazars and Székelys, and he acknowledged the suzerainty of the (unnamed) Byzantine Emperor of the time.

In the 11th century, King St. Ladislaus I of Hungary founded a bishopric settlement near the city of Oradea, the present Roman Catholic Diocese of Oradea. 

The Regestrum Varadinense is a record of legal proceedings between 1208 and 1235, containing 711 place names and 2500 personal names. The city flourished both economically and culturally during the 13th century as part of the Kingdom of Hungary. It was at this time that the Citadel of Oradea, first mentioned in 1241 during the Mongol invasion, was first built. The fortress would be destroyed and rebuilt several times over the following centuries. The 14th and 15th centuries were the most prosperous periods in the city&#x27;s history up to that point. Many monuments were erected, including statues of Saints Stephen, Emeric, and Ladislaus (before 1372) and the equestrian sculpture of St. King Ladislaus I (1390). The famous statue of St. Ladislaus was the first proto-renaissance public square equestrian monument in Europe. Bishop Andreas Báthori (1329–1345) rebuilt the Cathedral in Gothic style. From that epoch dates also the Hermes reliquary, now preserved at Győr, containing the skull of St. Ladislaus, a masterpiece of the Hungarian goldsmith&#x27;s art.

It was at this time that astronomer Georg von Peuerbach wrote his &quot;Tabula Varadiensis&quot;, published posthumously in 1464, which marked the city&#x27;s Observatory of Varadinum as the terrestrial point of reference and prime meridian.

In 1474, the city was besieged by the Turks during the absence of King Matthias Corvinus from the country. The city was severely damaged, but the king later resettled it with inhabitants from other parts of Hungary whom he exempted from taxes, a policy retained by Ferdinand I in 1553.

The Peace of Várad was concluded between Emperor Ferdinand I and John Zápolya here on 4 February 1538, in which they mutually recognized each other as legitimate monarchs. After the Ottoman invasion of Hungary in the 16th century, the city became a constant point of contention between the Principality of Transylvania, the Ottoman Empire, and the Habsburg monarchy. After the 1570 Treaty of Speyer, parts of Crișana, including Oradea, were incorporated into the newly formed Principality of Transylvania, a successor to the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom.

The Ottomans unsuccessfully laid siege to the city in 1598. After the Treaty of Vienna (1606), the city became a permanent part of the Principality of Transylvania by imperial decree.

After the Transylvanian Prince Gyorgy Rakoczi II&#x27;s failed attempt to gain the throne of Poland, the Ottomans sent yet another punitive expedition against him and his Wallachian and Moldavian allies, Gheorghe Ștefan and Constantin Șerban. In 1660 an Ottoman force of 45,000 men besieged the city for the last time. The 850 defenders managed to hold out for 46 days, but eventually, the city fell on 27 August due to internal treachery. The siege is described in detail by János Szalárdi in his contemporary chronicle. The Ottomans designated the city as the capital of the newly formed Eyalet of Varat. The eyalet included the sanjaks of Varat (Oradea), Salanta, Debreçin, Halmaş, Sengevi, and Yapışmaz. Ottoman rule of the city ended in 1692 when Habsburg imperial forces conquered it after a 14-month siege.

The city had been severely damaged in the war, with only 114 houses standing, 21 undamaged. Under the Habsburgs&#x27; reconstruction, in the 18th century Oradea entered its golden age. The Viennese engineer Franz Anton Hillebrandt was given the task of planning the city in the Baroque style and starting in 1752 many of the city&#x27;s current landmarks were constructed, such as the Roman Catholic Cathedral, the Moon Church, the State Theatre, and the Baroque Palace.

The city played a major role in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, being the home of the largest Hungarian arms factory.

After World War I, Oradea passed under Romanian control during the Hungarian–Romanian War of 1919 and became a part of the Kingdom of Romania under the Treaty of Trianon of 1920. In 1925, the city was designated a municipality, dissolving its former civic autonomy. Under the same ordinance, its name was changed from &quot;Oradea Mare&quot; (Great Oradea) to simply Oradea.

The Second Vienna Award brokered by Hitler and Mussolini in 1940 allowed Hungary to recover Northern Transylvania including Oradea, and mass celebrations welcomed the Hungarian administration. On 12 October 1944, Oradea was captured by Soviet troops of the 2nd Ukrainian Front during the Battle of Debrecen, and reverted to Romanian administration in March 1945. After World War II, Hungary had to relinquish claims to the city under the Treaty of Paris concluded on 10 February 1947.

After the Romanian Revolution of December 1989, many of the city&#x27;s inhabitants looked forward to a more prosperous future as part of Romania&#x27;s reforms toward democracy and a free market economy. Due to its history and institutions, Oradea is one of the most important economic and cultural centers of Romania, and is one of the country&#x27;s main academic centers, with a unique Romanian-Hungarian bilingual dynamic.

==Demographics==

At the 2021 census Oradea had a population of 183,105, a decrease from the figures recorded at the previous censuses.













===Jewish community===
:&quot;This section incorporates text from the 1901–1906&quot; Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, a publication now in the public domain.&quot;

The &quot;chevra kadisha&quot; (&quot;holy society&quot;) was founded in 1735, the first synagogue in 1803, and the first communal school in 1839. Not until the beginning of the 19th century were Jews permitted to do business in any other part of the city, and even then, they were required to return at nightfall to their own quarter. In 1835, permission was granted to live in any part of the city.

The Jewish community of Oradea became divided into Orthodox and Neolog . While the members of the Neolog congregation still retained their membership in the &quot;chevra kadisha&quot;, they started to use a cemetery of their own in 1899. In the early 20th century, the Jews of Oradea had won prominence in the public life of the city. There were Jewish manufacturers, merchants, lawyers, physicians, and farmers; the chief of police (1902) was a Jew; and in the municipal council, the Jewish element was proportionately represented. The community possessed, in addition to the hospital and &quot;chevra kadisha&quot;, a Jewish women&#x27;s association, a grammar school, a trade school for boys and girls, a yeshiva, a soup kitchen, etc.

According to the &quot;Center for Jewish Art&quot;:

The Oradea Jewish community was once the most active both commercially and culturally in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1944, twenty-five thousand Oradean Jews were deported to concentration camps by the Nazis, thus decimating this vital community. Only three hundred Jews reside in Oradea today. In the center of the city, on the river bank and towering over other buildings in the area, is the large Neolog Temple Synagogue built in 1878. The unusual cube-shaped synagogue with its large cupola is one of the largest in Romania. Inside there is a large organ and stucco decorations. In 1891, the Orthodox community also built a complex of buildings including two synagogues and a community center.

In 1944, during the occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany, Hungarian authorities forced the Jewish inhabitants into the Oradea ghetto before sending them to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Descendants of the pre-Holocaust Hasidic rabbinate in Oradea established a synagogue in the Willowbrook area of Staten Island, New York City. The synagogue maintains both a traditional Hasidic Nusach Sefard and a Nusach Ashkenaz service, the latter of which operates under the name &quot;Bais Medrash Igud Avreichim of Groisverdain&quot; (the Yiddish pronunciation of Grosswardein).

As of 2021, there is also a project to build a rabbinical seminary in Oradea.

== Politics and administration ==

The city government is headed by a mayor. Since 2020, the office is held by Florin Birta. Decisions are approved and discussed by the local government (&quot;consiliu local&quot;) made up of 27 elected councilors. 

==Quarters==

Before 1848, Oradea was made up of four separate towns: Várad-Újváros (Villa Nova, former Vicus Szombathely), Várad-Olaszi (Villa Latinorum Varadiensium, &quot;olasz&quot; meaning Italian), Várad-Velence (Vicus Venetia), Várad-Váralja (Civitas Waradiensis). The names Vicus Venetia, Villa Latinorum, Vicus Bolognia, Vicus Padua and others refer to the French, Walloons and Italian inhabitants who settled in the 13th century.

Today the city is made up of the following districts, called quarters (&quot;cartiere&quot; in Romanian, &quot;negyedek&quot; in Hungarian):
* Calea Aradului

==Economy==
Oradea has long been one of the more prosperous cities in Romania. The per capita GDP of Oradea is approximately 150% of the Romanian average. After 1989, due to its base of consumers, Oradea experienced an economic renewal, mostly in the services sector such as trade and tourism.
Oradea has an unemployment rate of 6.0%, slightly lower than the Romanian average but much higher than Bihor County&#x27;s average of around 2%. Oradea produces around 63% of the industrial production of Bihor County while accounting for 34.5% of the population of the county. Its main industries are furniture, textiles and clothing, footwear, and food processing. Oradea&#x27;s economy is sustained largely by small and medium businesses and the property taxes paid by citizens.

In the fiscal year 2012, Oradea had the largest budget in the Transylvania region, overcoming its neighbour cities, Arad and Cluj-Napoca. Some large Romanian companies, such as Adeplast, RCS-RDS, European Drinks, and FrigoExpress are located in Oradea.

Oradea is using geothermal electricity from water two kilometers below ground, which provides 7% of the energy for its district heating system. That system serves 70% of the city&#x27;s population with heat and hot water.

==Transport==
The public transport network is run by OTL (Oradea Transport Local), a municipal agency. It is made up of five tram lines (1R, 1N, 2, 3R, 3N, 4N, 4R, and the new 8) and 17 local bus lines (numbered from 10 to 26), and an international suburban one to Biharkeresztes, Hungary. The city has four train stations: , West, East, and Episcopia Bihor (Bihor Abbey). The West Station is located in the quarter of Ioșia, the Central Station (called simply Oradea) is located closer to the city center, near the quarter of Vie, while the East station is located in Velența.

Oradea is served by Oradea International Airport, which has reopened at the end of 2015, after repairs to the runway.

==Education==

The city is home to the University of Oradea, one of the largest universities in the country. There are also several private universities, one being Agora University, a modern academic institution founded in 2000. Emanuel University, an accredited private Baptist university, also existed in the city since 2002. The Partium Christian University was established in 1995 and teaches in Hungarian. 

As of 2012, there had been 232 years since the inauguration of higher education in Oradea and 48 years of continuous higher education. A higher institution for philosophic teaching was founded in Oradea in 1780, which became the Faculty of Law in 1788, the oldest faculty within a vast region of Eastern Europe.

After 1921, all the courses at the Law Faculty were taught in Romanian. In 1923, the foundation of two theological academies gave new dimensions to the academic life in Oradea. The Law Academy of Oradea, together with the two theological academies, was to make another step forward by integrating a faculty of letters, thus achieving the old desire of creating a University of Crișana in Oradea.

After a thirty-year break in the activity of the Law Academy of Oradea, on 1 October 1963, an order of the Ministry of Education established in Oradea a 3-year Pedagogic Institute meant to do away with the scarcity of teachers in secondary education. The new institution of higher education began its activity with two faculties: Philology and Mathematics-Physics, and a year later other two faculties, History-Geography and Physical Education, were added.

In May 1990, a decree of the Romanian Government established the Technical University of Oradea, later called the University of Oradea. It was an act of scientific and cultural restoration, a major gain of the People&#x27;s Revolution of December 1989, and an achievement in Crișana after the Great Union on 1 December 1918. A historian of Oradea explains: &quot;As regarding the future, the desire of all well-meant Romanians is to establish in Oradea a complete university, the lights of which will shine across the entire western border of Romania.&quot; The University of Oradea is an integrated institution of higher education, comprising 18 faculties.
The structure of the university contains academic education, postgraduate education, and scientific research. 

Research inside the University of Oradea is developing, natural and physical sciences, as well as in the area of social and human sciences, also covering Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Sciences of Life, Agricultural Sciences, Medical Sciences, Technological Sciences, Economical Sciences, Geography, History, Juridical Sciences and Law, Linguistics, Pedagogy, Political Sciences, Psychology, Letters and Arts, Sociology, Philosophy. 

The Sulyok István Reform College was founded in the spring of 1990 by the Királyhágómelléki Reform Church. In 1999, the school became entirely independent from the Protestant Theology College of Cluj-Napoca and changed its name to Partium Christian University. It presently operates with 12 faculties and a student body of 1400 and is taught in Hungarian.

==Architecture==

Oradea&#x27;s architecture is a mix of Communist-era apartment buildings, mainly in the outer quarters, and historical buildings built when the city was part of Austria-Hungary. In addition to many Baroque buildings, Oradea has a collection of Art Nouveau architecture.

Located at the Romanian western border, Nagyvárad (to be changed to Oradea after the Treaty of Trianon) had been part of the Hungarian Kingdom, and was, until the Treaty of Trianon in 1921, part of the Central European Austro-Hungarian Empire and, thus, was influenced by the artistic currents of this space.

The buildings of the early 20th century are marked by Lechner and Vienna Secession influence. By its independence and personality, Oradea has a place among the large great European families of the firmly contoured 1900 Art, especially regarding the area between the Citadel and the Main Railway Station. Here are rental buildings, (Moskovits Palace I and II, Apollo Palace, Stern Palace, Adorján Houses I and II, Darvasy Palace), villas (La Roche, Vágó, Okany Schwartz), hotels (Pannonia, Emke, Rimonoczy, Weiszlovics, Fekete Sas / Vulturul Negru), military buildings – on Armatei Române Street, industrial buildings and warehouses (beer-, spirit-, bricks-factories, electric plant&#x27;s chimney), public institutions (City Hall, Palace of Orthodox Bishopry, Palace of Greek-Catholic Bishopry, Palace of Justice, banks, houses of commerce and industry etc.), signed by architects who have a prime place in the European 1900 Architecture record: Odon Lechner, Dezső Jakab, Marcell Komor, László and József Vágó, Valér Mende, Ferenc Sztaril, Ferenc Löbl, Kálmán Rimanóczy Sr.and Jr., Anton Szallerbek. All these sites offer a very diverse research and development material.
These great architects brought in Nagyvárad (Oradea) the influence of Vienna and Budapest through their work, featuring a new style, different from the academic ones, thus creating the premises of a stylistic diversification based on inventions and originality.
Like many European cities, &quot;Small Paris&quot;, as Oradea was named at the beginning of the last century, has a belle-époque charm given by its Secession, eclectic, New-Romanian, Neoclassic and Baroque architecture. Not impressing by size or opulence, the buildings of Oradea have an aura of welfare, refinement and quality that imprints on the memory.
The early 20th century is well represented in the center, but almost every zone of the city has something especially particular.
The history center of the city has a great historical, cultural, architectural and urban planning heritage value. It includes settlements nuclei, architectural relics, monuments of architecture and urban planning beginning with the 16th century up to a well represented beginning of the 20th century.

A coherent style is evident in many of the city&#x27;s structures, characterized by features such as stucco moldings, statues, medallions, ironwork, stained-glass, and colored glass. The distinctive architecture of Oradea reflects the cultural influences of its diverse ethnic history, resulting in a rich shared heritage.

==Tourist attractions==

The old city centre is one of the main tourist highlights in Oradea, as are the Băile Felix health spas, accessible by bus and located just outside the city.

Other sites that attract tourists include:

* Baroque Palace of Oradea – today &quot;Muzeul Țării Crișurilor&quot;. It was the Roman Catholic bishop&#x27;s palace until 1945, when the Communist regime took the building into public ownership.

<text>This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Indochina.

==First stamps==
The postage stamps of French Indochina begin on May 16, 1886, with the overprinting of &quot;5&quot; or &quot;5 C. CH.&quot; on the generic stamps of the French Colonies, for use in Cochinchina (mainly Saigon).

On January 21, 1888, stamps crudely overprinted (meaning Annam &amp; Tonkin), along with a &quot;1&quot; or &quot;5&quot;, and also on the generic colonies stamps, were issued for those territories. The example at right was cancelled at Hanoi (spelled &quot;HA-NOI&quot;) in Tonkin, on 17 March 1888.

The 1889 unification of colonial administration first resulted in surcharges in January 1889, on the 35c French Colonies stamp, reading (8 January) and (10 January), where the &quot;R&quot; referred to the colonial governor P. Richaud, and the &quot;D&quot; to the postmaster at Saigon, General P. Demars. The example illustrated at right was cancelled at Vinh Long, a town of the Mekong Delta, on 4 April 1889, just a few months after the stamp was issued.

==First regular stamps==
In 1892 the first five regular stamps of Indochina were issued as part of the standard Navigation and Commerce, and inscribed . Three succeeding ones were issued in 1900, and two in 1902 - all in the same basic design with different colors.

Inscription of in the typical blank box at the bottom was replaced with printing of from the definite stamps issued in 1904.

Subsequent issues included an attractive and artistic set featuring native women (1907), a surcharged set of 1919 necessitated by the changeover from centimes and francs to cents and piasters in the previous year, and a reprinted set valued in the new currency, starting with a 1/10-cent denomination.

Sets featuring local sights appeared in 1927, 1931, and in 1936 depicting cultural views like a farmer plowing the ground or constructions, Apsara, and native emperors of Annam and Cambodie. They are followed by a variety of commemoratives honoring notable figures, up to a last airmail issue June 13, 1949, which was issued in only small numbers due to the growing rebellion.

A number of the 1940s issues were later overprinted and used by the Viet Minh

<text>A Michigan left or P-turn is an at-grade intersection design that replaces each left (farside) turn at an intersection between a (major) divided roadway and a secondary (minor) roadway with the combination of a right (nearside) turn followed by a U-turn, or a U-turn followed by a right (nearside) turn, depending on the situation. It is in use in numerous countries.

==Terminology==
This intersection design was given the name &quot;Michigan left&quot; due to its frequent use along roads and highways in the U.S. state of Michigan since the late 1960s. In other contexts, the intersection is called a median Uturn crossover or median Uturn, or restricted crossing U-turn (RCUT). The design is also sometimes referred to as a boulevard left, a boulevard turnaround, an indirect left turn, a Michigan loon, a Jturn, Pturn or a &quot;ThrU Turn&quot; intersection.

==Description==
The design occurs at intersections where at least one road is a divided highway or boulevard, and left turns onto—and usually from—the divided highway are prohibited. In almost every case, the divided highway is multi-laned in both directions. When on the secondary road, drivers are directed to turn right. Within , they queue into a designated U-turn (or cross-over) lane in the median. When traffic clears they complete the U-turn and go back through the intersection. Additionally, the U-turn lane is designed for one-way traffic.

Similarly, traffic on the divided highway cannot turn left at an intersection with a cross street. Instead, drivers are instructed to &quot;overshoot&quot; the intersection, go through the U-turn lane, come back to the intersection from the opposite direction, and turn right.

When vehicles enter the cross-over area, unless markings on the ground indicate two turning lanes in the cross-over, drivers form one lane. A cross-over with two lanes is designed at high-volume cross-overs, or when the right lane turns onto an intersecting street. In this case, the right lane is reserved for vehicles completing the design. Most crossovers must be made large enough for semi-trailer trucks to complete the crossover. This large cross-over area often leads to two vehicles incorrectly lining up at a single cross-over.

A Michigan left generally allows through traffic on the minor crossroads to proceed straight across the major road or highway, especially on the more heavily traveled minor roads.

Its design also is promoted as part of the Federal Highway Administration&#x27;s Every Day Counts initiative which started in 2011.

==Variations==
===Narrow median===
When the median of a road is too narrow to allow for a standard Michigan left maneuver, a variation can be used that widens the pavement in the opposite direction of travel. This widened pavement is known as a &quot;bulb out&quot; or a &quot;loon&quot; (from the pavement&#x27;s aerial resemblance to the aquatic bird). Such a design is sometimes referred to as a &quot;Michigan loon&quot;; in Utah, as a &quot;thrU turn&quot;, where one passes &quot;through&quot; the intersection before a &quot;U-turn&quot;.

===Grade separation===
In Guadalajara, Mexico, there is a grade-separated variation of this setup at the intersection of Mariano Otero Avenue and Manuel Gómez Morín Beltway (). Traffic flowing through Mariano Otero Avenue is routed onto an overpass above the beltway, with two access roads allowing right turns in all four possible directions; the U-turns, meanwhile, are built underneath the beltway and allow the left turn movements from Mariano Otero Avenue to the beltway.

===Superstreet===

A variation of the Michigan left that prohibits through traffic on minor roads from crossing the major road or highway, is most commonly called a superstreet or a &quot;restricted crossing Uturn&quot; (RCUT). In contrast to the standard Michigan left, left turns from the major road or highway to minor roads are usually allowed, although there is a variation that prohibits such turns.

==Examples==
===Angola===
The capital city of Angola, Luanda, makes widespread use of a simplified variant of this type of intersection on its two- and three-lane, median-separated throughways instead of using traffic lights. Larger junctions use this intersection type instead of much more costly grade-separated interchanges.

===Australia===
In Australia, where traffic drives on the left, the Victorian state government in 2009 introduced the &quot;P-turn&quot;, similar to the Michigan left, at the intersection of Moorooduc Highway (C777) and Cranbourne-Frankston Road (State Route 4) in the southeastern Melbourne suburb of Frankston. This requires right-turning vehicles to turn left then make a U-turn. As of May 2015, local residents had called for its removal.

On April 16, 2018, a P-turn was introduced at the intersection of Hoddle Street (State Route 29) and Johnston Street (State Route 34) in Abbotsford, Victoria. Another P-turn was added in 2019 at the intersection of the Punt Road section of State Route 29 and Swan Street (State Route 20) in Richmond.

===Brazil===
The Michigan left is a commonly used design in Brazil especially in São Paulo and Paraná.

===Canada===
In Ottawa, Ontario, a Michigan left exists to proceed from Bank Street to Riverside Drive in both directions.

The design has been proposed in Toronto, Ontario, to relieve motorists who wish to make a left-turn on roadways that will contain a proposed streetcar line by the Transit City project.

A Michigan left exists in Windsor, Ontario, on Huron Church Road, just north of the E.C. Row Expressway, where a narrow-median variant put in place years ago is now seldom used due to the realignment of the expressway in conjunction with the construction of the Herb Gray Parkway.

In Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, a Michigan left pairing exists on 8th Street, just west of its interchange with Circle Drive, as well as a few other U-turn lanes as one heads westbound.

===Hong Kong===
This is the design at some busy junctions in Hong Kong where traffic drives on the left. In Hong Kong Island examples include the junction of Fleming Road and Harbour Road in Wan Chai North, and the junction of Hennessey Road and Canal Road Flyover in Wong Nai Chung. In Kowloon this design exists between Cheong Wan Road and Hong Chong Road/Salisbury Road.

===Philippines===

In the Philippines, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) under Bayani Fernando implemented a &quot;no left-turn&quot; scheme in the early 2000s along several major roads in Metro Manila, prohibiting motor vehicle traffic from turning left at intersections and instead requiring them to make a U-turn at designated U-turn slots and making a right turn after. The scheme was designed to mimic the Michigan left turn design by creating continuous traffic, mitigating bottlenecks caused by traffic light signals. The MMDA claimed that its &quot;no left-turn&quot; scheme in addition to its No Contact Apprehension Policy and road obstruction clearing campaign has increased the average travel speed along major thoroughfares from in July 2001 to in June 2003.

However, the implementation of the &quot;no left-turn&quot; scheme in Metro Manila was controversial, as it was notorious among motorists for causing longer travel distances due to having to navigate to the nearest U-turn slot and for incidents of motorists missing their U-turn slot due to difficulties navigating to it safely. Several academic studies were also made on the &quot;no left-turn&quot; scheme, summarizing that the scheme induces longer travel time and only works with low car inflow and minimal lane changing maneuvers, with the U-turn slots eventually becoming congested themselves. Since then, many of these U-turn slots were closed and left-turning at most intersections was restored, although some still remain along roads such as EDSA, Quezon Avenue, and Circumferential Road 5.

===Mexico===
U-turn intersections are very common throughout Mexico, particularly in Mexico City.

===United Kingdom===
A similar style P-turn is used in the junction of the A4 Great West Road and A3002 Boston Manor Road in Brentford, England.

===United States===
In 2013, Michigan lefts were installed in Alabama for the first time, in several locations along heavily traveled U.S. Route 280 in metro Birmingham.

Tucson, Arizona, began introducing Michigan lefts in 2013, at Ina/Oracle and on Grant Road. Their reception has been mixed.

Indianapolis, Indiana, introduced the Michigan Left in 2013 at the intersection of 96th Street, and Allisonville Road (near the surrounding cities of Fishers, Indiana). The city has announced plans to tear out the Michigan Left due to its unpopularity amongst the locals. 

In November 2018, the Ada County Highway District completed work on a ThrU-turn intersection at the State Street/Veterans Memorial Parkway/36th Street intersection in Boise, Idaho.

The design is relatively common in New Orleans, Louisiana, and its suburb Metairie, where city boulevards may be split by streetcar tracks, and suburban thoroughfares are often split by drainage canals. Some intersections using this design are signed similarly to those in Michigan, but with more descriptive text; however, in some cases the only signage is &quot;No Left Turn&quot; and drivers are left to figure it out for themselves.

Since the redevelopment of the intersection between University Boulevard (MD 193) and Colesville Road (US 29) in Silver Spring, Maryland, a Michigan left has been used to increase efficiency of traffic through an otherwise underdeveloped and congested intersection. Due to its proximity to the Capital Beltway, heavy traffic is handled more safely and efficiently.

The Michigan Department of Transportation first used the modern design at the intersection of 8 Mile Road (M-102) and Livernois Avenue () in Detroit in the early 1960s. The increase in traffic flow and reduction in accidents was so dramatic (a 30–60% decrease) that over 700 similar intersections have been deployed throughout the state since then. Michigan keeps building Michigan lefts where the opportunity presents itself, completing a rebuild of a dangerous stretch of highway (US 131 in Three Rivers in 2021).

North Carolina has been implementing Michigan lefts along US 17 in the southeastern part of the state, outside Wilmington. In 2015, a Michigan left was constructed at the intersection of Poplar Tent Road and Derita Road in the Charlotte suburb of Concord.

Columbus, Ohio introduced a Michigan left at the intersection of SR 161 and Strawberry Farms Boulevard in 2012.

At least two Michigan lefts have existed in Texas. One was located at the intersection of Fondren Road and Bellaire Boulevard in Houston from the 1980s through 2007, when it was replaced with conventional left-turn lanes. Another was built in mid-2010 in Plano at the intersection of Preston Road and Legacy Drive. In January 2014, the city announced plans to revert the turn to a traditional intersection as a result of drivers&#x27; confusion. A section of State Highway 71 east of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport at FM 973 in Austin, Texas did have a signalized Michigan U-turn that was constructed in 2014—this was a temporary fix until the SH71 tollway over SH130 (including the re-routing of FM973) was completed in early 2016. There are multiple Michigan left turns currently being used along US 281 north of Loop 1604 in San Antonio. These were adopted as a short-term solution for traffic issues as development expanded north, but will likely be phased out as US 281 is elevated.

In 2024, Virginia instituted a Michigan turn at the intersection of Fredericksburg Rd. and US 29 in Greene County.

The city of Draper, Utah, a suburb of Salt Lake City, announced in 2011 that it would be building Utah&#x27;s first &quot;ThrU Turn&quot; at the intersection of 12300 South and State Street, just off Interstate 15 through Salt Lake County. Construction began in summer 2011 and was completed in fall 2011. Other similar intersections were implemented in South Jordan and Layton.

==Applicable traffic studies==
This type of intersection configuration, as with any engineered solution to a traffic problem, carries with it certain advantages and disadvantages and has been subject to several studies.

Studies have shown a major reduction in left-turn collisions and a minor reduction in merging and diverging collisions, due to the shifting of left turns outside the main intersection. In addition, it reduces the number of different traffic light phases, significantly increasing traffic flow. Because separate phases are no longer needed for left turns, this increases green time for through traffic. The effect on turning traffic is mixed. Consequently, the timing of traffic signals along a highway featuring the design is made easier by the elimination of left-turn phases both on that highway and along intersecting roadways contributing to the reduction of travel times and the increased capacity of those roadways.

It has been shown to enhance safety for pedestrians at these intersections, since they only encounter through traffic and vehicles making right turns. The elimination of left turns removes one source of potential vehicle-pedestrian conflict. One minor disadvantage of the Michigan left is the extra distance required for the motorist to drive. Sometimes the distance to the turnaround is as far away as past the intersection. This design leads to each motorist driving an additional to make a left turn. It also results in left-turning vehicles having to stop up to three times in the execution of the turn.

<text>The Pachycephalidae are a family of bird species that includes the whistlers, shrikethrushes, and three of the pitohuis, and is part of the ancient Australo-Papuan radiation of songbirds. The family includes 69 species that are separated into five genera. Its members range from small to medium in size, and occupy most of Australasia. Australia and New Guinea are the centre of their diversity and, in the case of the whistlers, the South Pacific islands as far as Tonga and Samoa and parts of Asia as far as India. The exact delimitation of boundaries of the family are uncertain, and one species, the golden whistler, has been the subject of intense taxonomic scrutiny in recent years, with multiple subspecies and species-level revisions.

The family Pachycephalidae was introduced (as the subfamily Pachycephalinae) by the English ornithologist William Swainson in 1832.

The genera &quot;Pachycare&quot;, &quot;Hylocitrea&quot;, the crested bellbird and the crested shriketit were previously included in the family Pachycephalidae until moved to the families Acanthizidae, Hylocitreidae and Oreoicidae and Falcunculidae respectively. Some authorities have also placed the genus &quot;Mohoua&quot;, classified in the monotypic family Mohouidae, within the family Pachycephalidae.

The whistler family has five extant genera as follows:

* &quot;Coracornis&quot; – 2 species
* &quot;Melanorectes&quot; – black pitohui
* &quot;Pachycephala&quot; – typical whistlers (53 species)
* &quot;Pseudorectes&quot; – 2 species
* &quot;Colluricincla&quot; – 11 species

==Description==
The whistlers are stout birds with strong bills, and the group was once known as the thickheads due to the large rounded heads of many species. Their plumage is rufous, brown, or grey in the majority of species. Nevertheless, a few species, particularly the golden whistler and its close relatives, have bright plumage. One of the more unusual traits of this family is found in the feathers of some of the pitohuis, which have toxins. These toxins are probably a deterrent to parasites and may also serve to dissuade predators from taking the birds.

===Vocalisations===
Several species belonging to this family are outstanding songsters: the whistlers produce an astonishing volume for their size, and the lyrebirds aside, the grey shrikethrush is often regarded as the finest, most inventive songbird of them all.

==Distribution and habitat==
The whistlers are birds of forests and wooded areas. Most species inhabit rainforest, particularly in the Asian and Papuan parts of their range, but Australian species inhabit a wider range of habitats including woodlands, arid scrubland and mangrove forests. Some species are restricted to a particular ecosystem, whereas others are more catholic and will inhabit a range of habitat types.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Little is known about the breeding biology of most of the family; what is known generally comes from a small number of Australian species and the three New Zealand &quot;Mohoua&quot; species. They are monogamous and generally nest as simple pairs, although breeding groups have been recorded in some species.

===Food and feeding===
They are insectivorous, picking insects off leaves, branches, or leaf litter. While insects make up the majority of the diet they will also feed on spiders, worms, centipedes, snails, and small crabs; larger species will also tackle small vertebrates such as frogs, geckos and baby birds. They are generally sedate foragers and do not engage in hawking to obtain prey, instead being gleaners and probers. Only a few species migrate, most remaining resident in their tropical environment.

<text>Callaeidae (sometimes Callaeatidae) is a family of passerine birds endemic to New Zealand. It contains three genera, with five species in the family. One species, the huia, became extinct early in the 20th century, while the South Island kōkako is critically endangered and may be extinct.

Although sometimes known as &quot;wattled crows&quot;, they are not corvids and are only distantly related to crows - &quot;New Zealand wattlebirds&quot; is the informal name for this family used by the scientific community.

==Biology and evolution==
They are ground-dwelling songbirds, 26–38 cm in length. They inhabit dense forests, where they feed on insects. They have strong legs and featherless wattles behind the bill. Their wings are rounded and unusually weak, giving them very limited powers of flight. They are monogamous and maintain permanent territories.

These birds seem to be remnants of an early expansion of passerines to New Zealand. Their only close relative is the stitchbird.

The phylogenetic relationships between the species shown below is based on a study published in 2022. The South Island saddleback (&quot;Philesturnus carunculatus&quot;) was not sampled.

==Species==
* Genus &quot;Callaeas&quot;
**North Island kōkako, &quot;Callaeas wilsoni&quot;
**South Island kōkako, &quot;Callaeas cinereus&quot; (possibly extinct)
* Genus &quot;Philesturnus&quot;
**North Island saddleback, &quot;Philesturnus rufusater&quot;

<text>Camano Island is a large island in Possession Sound, a section of Puget Sound. It is part of Island County, Washington, and is located between Whidbey Island and the mainland (Snohomish County) by the Saratoga Passage to the west and Port Susan and Davis Slough to the east. The island has one road connection to the mainland, via State Route 532 over the Camano Gateway Bridge at the northeast end of the island, connecting to the city of Stanwood.

The island has a total area of , making it one of the largest in the state of Washington. It has a year-round population of 15,661 as of the 2010 census. The population peaks at over 17,000 during the summer months due to part-time residents with vacation homes on the island. It is an unincorporated area with several small communities and shares civic facilities with nearby Stanwood, including its school district, and post office.

Camano Island is home to two state parks, Cama Beach and Camano Island State Park, and several county and local parks.

== Etymology and name ==
One recorded name of Camano Island in Lushootseed, collected by ethnologist Colin E. Tweddell, is . This name has also been given as the name for the settlement of Camano rather than the whole island. However, other sources agree with Tweddell that or is the name of Camano City.

In English, the island was named for 18th century Spanish explorer Jacinto Caamaño. American explorer Charles Wilkes, during the Wilkes Expedition of 1838–1842, named it &quot;Macdonough Island&quot; in honor of Thomas Macdonough for his victory of the Battle of Lake Champlain during the War of 1812. Following this theme, Wilkes named the body of water between Camano and Whidbey Island after Macdonough&#x27;s flagship the &quot;Saratoga&quot;. When Henry Kellett reorganized the official British Admiralty charts in 1847, he removed Wilkes&#x27; name &quot;Macdonough&quot; and bestowed the name &quot;Camano&quot;, which the Spanish explorer Francisco de Eliza had originally given to Admiralty Inlet in 1790. Wilkes&#x27; name &quot;Saratoga Passage&quot; was retained.

The island was known as Perry Island after the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott between several Indigenous peoples and the United States. The island was also called &quot;Crow Island&quot; during the early 20th century.

==History==

===19th century===

Prior to American settlement, Camano Island was within the territory of both the Kikiallus and the Snohomish peoples. The Kikiallus controlled the northern parts of the island around modern-day Utsalady, while the Snohomish controlled the areas of the island south of Point Demock (). Other tribes also used the island, such as the Lower Skagit, Stillaguamish, Snoqualmie, and Sauk-Suiattle. The island may have been a &quot;free-use&quot; area where usage was not strictly restricted like other places.

Prior to the population decline due to smallpox, there were likely many villages all along the island, and the Kikiallus were said to have 6 villages. Artifacts and human remains attributed to an old village were discovered by archaeologists at Cama Beach which were dated to 1,600 years before present. By the beginning of the 19th century, there were two known villages: a Kikiallus village at Utsalady (), and a Snohomish village at Camano Head ().

Around 1820, a major landslide occurred at Camano Head that completely demolished the village there. It also created a tidal wave which destroyed another Snohomish village on Hat Island, and almost destroyed the main village of Hibulb. Hundreds of people died or drowned, including visitors to the village for the clamming season. After the catastrophic event, the site of Camano Head was never used as a village, but did continue to be used seasonally for clamming.

Camano Island continued to be under the Snohomish and Kikiallus until 1855, when, under the Treaty of Point Elliot, they ceded control of most of their lands, including Camano Island, to the United States. White settlement on the island began in the 1850s and it was included in the newly established Island County in 1853. The first major settlement on the island was at Utsalady (originally spelled Utsaladdy), which would be home to several sawmills. The first sawmill on the island was constructed by Thomas Cranney in 1858 and a school district was organized in 1862 to serve 17 students in a one-room schoolhouse.

Cranney&#x27;s sawmill at Utsalady was seized by the federal government in 1876 due to his bankruptcy and sold the following year to the Puget Mill Company, which enlarged it to handle 75,000 board feet per day. A plat for Utsalady was filed in 1891, with the town boasting three stores, two hotels, a telegraph line, and daily steamship service to Coupeville. The area had a large population of Chinese and Norwegian immigrants who worked at the mill until the former were expelled by anti-Chinese riots in the 1880s. By the 1880 census, there were 112 residents in Utsalady and 74 Coast Salish peoples in other settlements on Camano Island. Following the Panic of 1893, the Utsalady sawmill was closed and left 125 residents unemployed, but five shingle mills were later opened to capitalize on the island&#x27;s timber.

===20th century===

Camano Island was identified as an ideal location for farming and vacation homes during the early 20th century, as logging had cleared the island&#x27;s old-growth forests. A cable ferry connecting the island&#x27;s north end to Stanwood was replaced by a bridge in 1909. The first resort settlements on Camano Island at Utsalady, Juniper Beach, and Madrona beach were established in the 1920s, but were later dwarfed by larger resorts like Cama Beach (opened in 1936). During the Prohibition era, Camano Island was used as a major transiting point for rumrunners due to its remoteness and proximity to Canadian waters. The Juniper Beach area was also home to a new oyster farm that was established in 1930 and helped sustain the island during the Great Depression.

In 1943, the Puget Mill Company began developing its plots into residential subdivisions, ushering in the arrival of permanent summer homes on the island. The Stillaguamish River bridge to Stanwood was replaced in July 1950 by the Mark Clark Bridge and the island&#x27;s roads were also improved by the state government. A new state park was established in 1948 and opened the following year after a day-long event in which 800 residents cleared the land to prepare for park development. In the 1950s, the island received its own post office, having previously been part of the Stanwood post office&#x27;s delivery area, an organized fire department, and telephone service. Major population growth in the 1960s and early 1970s caused strain on the island&#x27;s infrastructure, requiring the creation of a new planning office and a satellite county courthouse.

==Geography==

Camano Island is located within the Puget Sound, separated from the mainland of Snohomish County by Port Susan and Davis Slough. It lies east of the Saratoga Passage, which separates it from the larger Whidbey Island, and is south of Skagit Bay. The northern entrance to Camano Island is located north of Seattle. The island itself is long and has a width of , with of shoreline.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Camano CDP has a total area of 94.9 square miles (245.9 km2), of which, 39.8 square miles (103.0 km2) of it is land and 55.2 square miles (142.9 km2) of it (58.11%) is water. Approximately 83 percent of the shoreline around the island is privately owned.

The island has a wide array of native and migratory birds, including bald eagles and herons. Migrating gray whales travel annually through the Saratoga Passage in March and April, making them visible from Camano Island.

During the Last Ice Age the island, sound and land surrounding the sound was covered by a mile thick sheet of ice. As temperatures rose the glacier receded, carving the island and leaving behind deposits of glacial till.

===Parks and recreation===

The state parks system has two properties on Camano Island: Camano Island State Park and Cama Beach State Park, both located on the west side of the island. Camano Island State Park, near Elger Bay, was opened in 1949 after a one-day volunteer effort with 500 local residents to prepare the property. It has of shoreline, camping areas, and hiking trails on of land. Cama Beach State Park opened in 2008 at the site of a former beach resort, which was restored with beachside cabins and hiking trails.

Camano Island also has 13 local parks maintained by the Island County government. The largest park, Camano Ridge, includes of inland protected forestland and hiking trails that were transferred from the Washington State Department of Natural Resources in 2003. At the north end of the island is Iverson Preserve, a beach and estuary with fishing and boat access. Barnum Point County Park on Port Susan was opened in August 2019 with of waterfront space, acquired with $750,000 in private donations through a local land trust.

==Demographics==
Camano Island has a large seasonal population of snowbirds and other part-time residents, which brings the summer population of the island to an estimated 17,000. The retiree population on the island began arriving in the mid-20th century, including residents from outside of Washington state. Based on per capita income, one of the more reliable measures of affluence, Camano ranks 99th of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked.

===2000 census===

As of the 2000 census, there were 13,347 people, 5,357 households, and 4,028 families residing in the Camano Island CDP. The population density was 335.6 people per square mile (129.6/km2). There were 6,709 housing units at an average density of 168.7/sq mi (65.1/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 95.6% White, 0.3% African American, 0.8% Native American, 0.7% Asian, 0.3% Pacific Islander, 0.6% from other races, and 1.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.1% of the population.

There were 5,357 households, out of which 28.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.0% were married couples living together, 6.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.8% were non-families. 20.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 2.86.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 24.1% under the age of 18, 4.8% from 18 to 24, 25.2% from 25 to 44, 27.7% from 45 to 64, and 18.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.9 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $54,262, and the median income for a family was $60,013. Males had a median income of $47,309 versus $31,250 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $24,362. About 4.4% of families and 5.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.5% of those under age 18 and 3.3% of those age 65 or over.

==Government==

Camano Island is part of Island County, despite its only road connection leading to Snohomish County, and has no incorporated communities. The island&#x27;s residents have previously proposed incorporating as a city or joining Snohomish County to increase access to services, but to no result. Island County maintains a small government campus on Camano Island that opened in the 1970s to house the county sheriff and other offices. The original campus was replaced by the Island County Administration Building, which opened in late 2020.

The island shares several of its services with neighboring Stanwood, including the Stanwood-Camano School District. The school district has two elementary schools on Camano Island, opened in the 2000s, while older students attend classes at Stanwood&#x27;s schools. Sno-Isle Libraries, which serves Island and Snohomish counties, opened a public library inside a temporary space on Camano Island as part of a pilot program that began in 2007. A permanent library at Terry&#x27;s Corner opened in August 2015 after voters on the island approved a $2.3 million bond measure to remodel a former restaurant.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Camano Island is connected to mainland Washington by State Route 532, which travels from the north end of the island to Stanwood via two bridges over the Davis Slough and Stillaguamish River. The island has several connecting roads that travel along the west and east edges to various neighborhoods and the two state parks. Island Transit operates free bus services connecting Camano Island to Stanwood, with onward connections to Mount Vernon, Amtrak &quot;Cascades&quot;, and Everett.

Ferry connections to Coupeville and Everett existed historically, but the routes are no longer active. Local residents rejected a car ferry in 1999. A passenger-only Camano–Whidbey ferry has been proposed and studied by Island County.

===Utilities===

Camano Island&#x27;s electricity is provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District, a public agency based in Everett. The island&#x27;s electrical supply is delivered through a set of two high-voltage transmission lines that cross from Stanwood to a substation in northern Camano; the second transmission line was constructed in 2023. Tap water is sourced from groundwater wells on the island that are maintained by community cooperatives and small companies rather than a large operator.

<text>Bowerbirds () make up the bird family Ptilonorhynchidae. They are renowned for their unique courtship behaviour, where males build a structure and decorate it with sticks and brightly coloured objects in an attempt to attract a mate.

The family has 27 species in eight genera. These are medium to large-sized passerines, ranging from the golden bowerbird at and to the great bowerbird at and . Their diet consists mainly of fruit but may also include insects (especially for nestlings), flowers, nectar and leaves in some species. The satin and spotted bowerbirds are sometimes considered agricultural pests due to their habit of feeding on introduced fruit and vegetable crops and have occasionally been killed by affected orchardists.

The bowerbirds have an Australo-Papuan distribution, with ten species endemic to New Guinea, eight endemic to Australia, and two found in both. Although their distribution is centered on the tropical regions of New Guinea and northern Australia, some species extend into central, western, and southeastern Australia. They occupy a range of different habitats, including rainforest, eucalyptus and acacia forest, and shrublands. While the females are unequivocally drab, in some species the males have bright golden-yellow and sometimes black markings.

One group with particularly inconspicuous plumage in males as well as females, but loud meowing calls, is known as &quot;catbirds&quot;. Note that the ptilonorhynchid catbirds, the grey catbird (&quot;Dumetella carolinensis&quot;) and black catbird (&quot;Melanoptila glabrirostris&quot;) from the Americas, and the Abyssinian catbird (&quot;Sylvia=Parophasma galinieri&quot;) from Africa, are only related by their common name; they belong to different families.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The &quot;Ailuroedus&quot; catbirds are monogamous, with males raising chicks with their partners, but all other bowerbirds are polygynous, with the female building the nest and raising the young alone. These latter species are commonly dimorphic, with the female being drabber in color. Female bowerbirds build a nest by laying soft materials, such as leaves, ferns, and vine tendrils, on top of a loose foundation of sticks.

All Papuan bowerbirds lay one egg, while Australian species lay one to three with laying intervals of two days. Bowerbird eggs are around twice the weight of those of most passerines of similar size – for instance eggs of the satin bowerbird weigh around as against a calculated for a passerine weighing . Eggs hatch after 19 to 24 days, depending on the species and are a plain cream color for catbirds and the tooth-billed bowerbird, but in other species possess brownish wavy lines similar to eggs of Australo-Papuan babblers. In accordance with their lengthy incubation periods, bowerbirds that lay more than one egg have asynchronous hatching, but siblicide has never been observed.

Bowerbirds as a group have the longest life expectancy of any passerine family with significant banding studies. The two most studied species, the green catbird and satin bowerbird, have life expectancies of around eight to ten years and one satin bowerbird has been known to live for twenty-six years. For comparison, the common raven, the heaviest passerine species with significant banding records, has not been known to live longer than 21 years.

=== Courtship and mating ===
The most notable characteristic of bowerbirds is their extraordinarily complex courtship and mating behaviour, where males build a to attract mates. There are two main types of bowers. Prionodura, Amblyornis, Scenopoeetes and Archiboldia bowerbirds build so-called maypole bowers, which are constructed by placing sticks around a sapling; in the former two species these bowers have a hut-like roof. Chlamydera, Sericulus and Ptilonorhynchus bowerbirds build an avenue-type bower made of two walls of vertically placed sticks. Ailuroedus catbirds are the only species which do not construct either bowers or display courts. In and around the bower, the male places a variety of brightly colored objects he has collected. These objects — usually different among each species — may include hundreds of shells, leaves, flowers, feathers, stones, berries, and even discarded plastic items, coins, nails, rifle shells, or pieces of glass. The males spend hours arranging this collection. Bowers within a species share a general form but do show significant variation, and the collection of objects reflects the biases of males of each species and its ability to procure items from the habitat, often stealing them from neighboring bowers. Several studies of different species have shown that colors of decorations males use on their bowers match the preferences of females.

In addition to the bower construction and ornamentation, male birds perform involved courtship displays to attract the female. Research suggests the male adjusts his performance based on success and female response.

Mate-searching females commonly visit multiple bowers, often returning to preferred bowers several times, and watching males&#x27; elaborate courtship displays and inspecting the quality of the bower. Through this process the female reduces the set of potential mates. Many females end up selecting the same male, and many under-performing males are left without copulations. Females mated with top-mating males tend to return to the male the next year and search less.

It has been suggested that there is an inverse relationship between bower complexity and the brightness of plumage. There may be an evolutionary &quot;transfer&quot; of ornamentation in some species, from their plumage to their bowers, in order to reduce the visibility of the male and thereby its vulnerability to predation. This hypothesis is not well supported because species with vastly different bower types have similar plumage. Others have suggested that the bower functioned initially as a device that benefits females by protecting them from forced copulations and thus giving them enhanced opportunity to choose males and benefits males by enhancing female willingness to visit the bower. Evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from observations of Archbold&#x27;s bowerbirds that have no true bower and have greatly modified their courtship so that the male is limited in his ability to mount the female without her cooperation. In tooth-billed bowerbirds that have no bowers, males may capture females out of the air and forcibly copulate with them. Once this initial function was established, bowers were then co-opted by females for other functions such as use in assessing males based on the quality of bower construction. Recent studies with robot female bowerbirds have shown that males react to female signals of discomfort during courtship by reducing the intensity of their potentially threatening courtship. Young females tend to be more easily threatened by intense male courtship, and these females tend to choose males based on traits not dependent on male courtship intensity.

The high degree of effort directed at mate choice by females and the large skews in mating success directed at males with quality displays suggests that females gain important benefits from mate choice. Since males have no role in parental care and give nothing to females except sperm, it is suggested that females gain genetic benefits from their mate choice. However this has not been established, in part because of the difficulty of following offspring performance since males take seven years to reach sexual maturity. One hypothesis for the evolutionary causation of the bower building display is Hamilton and Zuk&#x27;s &quot;bright bird&quot; hypothesis, which states that sexual ornaments are indicators of general health and heritable disease resistance. Doucet and Montgomerie determined that the male bowerbird&#x27;s plumage reflectance indicates internal parasitic infection, whereas the bower quality is a measure of external parasitic infection. This would suggest that the bowerbird mating display evolved due to parasite-mediated sexual selection, although there is some controversy surrounding this conclusion.

This complex mating behaviour, with its highly valued types and colors of decorations, has led some researchers to regard the bowerbirds as among the most behaviorally complex species of bird. It also provides some of the most compelling evidence that the extended phenotype of a species can play a role in sexual selection and indeed, act as a powerful mechanism to shape its evolution, as seems to be the case for humans. Inspired by their seemingly extreme courtship rituals, Charles Darwin discussed both bowerbirds and birds-of-paradise in his writings.

In addition, many species of bowerbird are superb vocal mimics. MacGregor&#x27;s bowerbird, for example, has been observed imitating pigs, waterfalls, and human chatter. Satin bowerbirds commonly mimic other local species as part of their courtship display.

Bowerbirds have also been observed creating optical illusions in their bowers to appeal to mates. They arrange objects in the bower&#x27;s court area from smallest to largest, creating a forced perspective which holds the attention of the female for longer. Males with objects arranged in a way that have a strong optical illusion are likely to have higher mating success.

==Taxonomy and systematics ==
Though bowerbirds have traditionally been regarded as closely related to the birds of paradise, recent molecular studies suggest that while both families are part of the great corvid radiation that took place in or near Sahul (Australia-New Guinea), the bowerbirds are more distant from the birds of paradise than was once thought. DNA–DNA hybridization studies placed them close to the lyrebirds; however, anatomical evidence appears to contradict this placement, and the true relationship remained unresolved for long. Cladistic analyses in the mid-2010s usually allied bowerbirds with the Australasian treecreepers (Climacteridae), another Sahul endemic family which is highly adapted to a woodpecker-like lifestyle (woodpeckers being absent from Sahul). This putative superfamily forms part of a large basal radiation of ancient songbirds, with the lyrebirds being part of a more ancestral branch than the bowerbirds and their DNA-DNA hybridization similarities being due to the phenetic methodology which (unlike cladistic analysis) merely assesses overall similarity without accounting for convergent evolution.

Many bowerbirds (in particular New Guinean species) are little known and even less studied. But the hypothesized relationships of 3 roughly equally distinct groups and one peculiar species inferred from courtship behaviour and external appearance are by and large confirmed by molecular phylogenetics, . Some insights from the more recent studies, however, were less expected: The Tooth-billed catbird, with its unique &quot;stagemaker&quot; courtship, was long suspected not to be a true catbird (genus &quot;Ailuroedus&quot;). As it turned out, this is not only correct, but in fact the Tooth-billed catbird is robustly resolved by the mtDNA data as more closely related to the &quot;maypole&quot;-type bower builders than to &quot;Ailuroedus&quot;, and certainly warrants separation in genus &quot;Scenopoeetes&quot;. Also, the enigmatic &quot;maypole-builder&quot; genus &quot;Archboldia&quot; seems to be merely a &quot;Amblyornis&quot; with unusually heavy melanin pigmentation as is often found in tropical rainforest birds. On the other hand, the &quot;avenue-builders&quot; also have a hypermelanic lineage, the satin bowerbird, but this seems well separable as a monotypic genus &quot;Ptilonorhynchus&quot;, as is the &quot;maypole-building&quot; golden bowerbird (as &quot;Prionodura&quot;). Interestingly, the widely divergent &quot;avenue-builders&quot; may represent the oldest living lineage, with the monogamous true catbirds, which do not build a bower and were traditionally held to be &quot;primitive&quot;, as the most derived group among living bowerbirds – the last common ancestor of the living bowerbirds is hypothesized to have been polygynous, with sexually dimorphic plumage – cryptic greenish in the females, and probably dark with a yellow belly in the males. But overall relationships between the true catbirds, the &quot;maypole-builders&quot; and the &quot;avenue-builders&quot; were not definitely resolvable, with only a small outgroup being used and outgroup effects on intra-family relationships not being tested. Even so, it is precisely this uncertainty about inter-group relationships that strongly suggests that the &quot;maypole&quot;/&quot;avenue&quot; bowers are not one ancestral and one derived type, but evolved independent of one another, perhaps from a &quot;clean stage&quot;-type courtship arena which is commonly established by all bower-building species at the start of bower construction, and persists in little-altered form (just adding some remarkable leaves strewn about as decoration) in &quot;Scenopoeetes&quot; which almost certainly is the most ancient living lineage of the &quot;maypole-builders&quot;. Among the catbirds, the white-cheeked group (&quot;A.buccoides/geislerorum/stonii&quot;) is very likely the most ancient one, which is also in line with the hypothesis that bowerbirds have become more and more drab and inconspicuous as their evolution progressed.

Fossil record
Bowerbirds have a scant fossil record that nonetheless extends to the Chattian (latest Oligocene), with the fossil species &quot;Sericuloides marynguyenae&quot; dated to 26 to 23 million years ago. It was found in Faunal Zone A deposits of the White Hunter Site at D-site Plateau of the Riversleigh World Heritage Area. &quot;S. marynguyenae&quot; was a tiny member of its family, about the same size as the golden bowerbird. It is known from the proximal end of a right carpometacarpus and the proximal end of a left tarsometatarsus. The material, though fragmentary, preserves much detail, and is overall more similar to the &quot;avenue-builders&quot; – in particular &quot;Chlamydera&quot; – than to the other two main groups. However, the splits between the three main groups of living bowerbirds are presumed to have occurred only in the Miocene, some time after &quot;Sericuloides&quot; lived. Thus, the fossil species may have belonged to a more basal and now entirely extinct lineage, and/or it may be considered to support the hypothesis that the &quot;avenue-builders&quot; are the most ancient group of bowerbirds and retain many &quot;primitive&quot; features in their anatomy. 

Other than &quot;S. marynguyenae&quot;, as of 2023 only one other prehistoric bowerbird species is known. This has not been named, as it is only known from the distal left ulna piece QM F57970 (AR19857), also found on the D-site Plateau of Riversleigh WHA, but in interval 3 of Faunal Zone B at the Ross Scott-Orr site, in late early Miocene (Burdigalian) sediments dated to 16.55 mya. Even though this piece of fossil bone is merely some 16 mm long, it is excellently preserved, and its features are characteristic of a smallish bowerbird the size of a black-eared catbird. Bowerbird ulnae – to the extent they have been studied – differ little between genera and species, but the Miocene fossil is unlike all living members of the family in one detail or another. If anything, it resembles the presumably more advanced groups (&quot;maypole-builders&quot; and true catbirds) more than the &quot;avenue-builders&quot; and given its age it may well have been one of the earliest members of either of the former two groups.

<text>Neal Paul Hefti (October 29, 1922 – October 11, 2008) was an American jazz trumpeter, composer, and arranger. He wrote music for &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; movie and TV series and for the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series.

He began arranging professionally in his teens, when he wrote charts for Nat Towles. He composed and arranged while working as a trumpeter for Woody Herman providing the bandleader with versions of &quot;Woodchopper&#x27;s Ball&quot; and &quot;Blowin&#x27; Up a Storm&quot; and composing &quot;The Good Earth&quot; and &quot;Wild Root&quot;. He left Herman&#x27;s band in 1946. Now concentrating on writing music only, he began an association with Count Basie in 1950. Hefti occasionally led his own bands.

==Beginnings==
Neal Paul Hefti was born October 29, 1922, to an impoverished family in Hastings, Nebraska, United States. He later recalled his family relying on charity when he was a young child. He started playing the trumpet in school at the age of eleven, and by high school was spending his summer vacations playing in local territory bands to help his family make ends meet.

Growing up in, and near Omaha, Hefti was exposed to some of the great bands and trumpeters of the Southwest territory bands. He also was able to see some of the virtuoso jazz musicians from New York who came through Omaha on tour. His early influences all came from the North Omaha scene. He said,

We&#x27;d see Basie in town, and I was impressed by Harry Edison and Buck Clayton, being a trumpet player. And I would say I was impressed by Dizzy Gillespie when he was with Cab Calloway. I was impressed by those three trumpet players of the people I saw in person... I thought Harry Edison and Dizzy Gillespie were the most unique of the trumpet players I heard.
These experiences seeing Gillespie and Basie play in Omaha foreshadowed his period in New York watching Gillespie play and develop the music of bebop on 52nd Street and his later involvement with Count Basie&#x27;s band.

In 1939, while still a junior at North High in Omaha, he got his start in the music industry by writing arrangements of vocal ballads for local bands, like the Nat Towles band. Harold Johnson recalled that Hefti&#x27;s first scores for that band were &quot;Swingin&#x27; On Lennox Avenue&quot; and &quot;More Than You Know,&quot; as well as a very popular arrangement of &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;. Some material that he penned in high school also was used by the Earl Hines band.

Two days before his high school graduation ceremony in 1941, he got an offer to go on tour with the Dick Barry band, so he traveled with them to New Jersey. He quickly was fired from the band after two gigs because he could not sight-read music well enough. Stranded in New Jersey because he did not have enough money to get home to Nebraska, he finally joined Bob Astor&#x27;s band. Shelly Manne, drummer with Bob Astor at the time, recalled that even then Hefti&#x27;s writing skills were quite impressive:
We roomed together. And at night we didn&#x27;t have nothing to do, and we were up at this place — Budd Lake. He said, &quot;What are we going to do tonight?&quot; I said, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you write a chart for tomorrow?&quot; Neal was so great that he&#x27;d just take out the music paper, no score, [hums] — trumpet part, [hums] — trumpet part, [hums] — trombone part, [hums], and you&#x27;d play it the next day. It was the end. Cooking charts. I never forget, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I kept watching him. It was fantastic.
Hefti, who was classified 4-F (ineligible for military service) during World War II after being hit by a car in New York and breaking his pelvis, would not focus on arranging seriously for a few more years. As a member of Astor&#x27;s band, he concentrated on playing trumpet.

After an injury forced him to leave Bob Astor, he stayed a while in New York. He played with Bobby Byrne in late 1942, then with Charlie Barnet for whom he wrote the classic arrangement of &quot;Skyliner&quot;. During his time in New York, he hung around the clubs on 52nd Street, listening to bebop trumpet master Dizzy Gillespie and other musicians, and immersing himself in the new music. Since he didn&#x27;t have the money to actually go into the clubs, he would sneak into the kitchen and hang out with the bands, and he got to know many of the great beboppers.

He finally left New York for a while to play with the Les Lieber rhumba band in Cuba. When he returned from Cuba in 1943, he joined the Charlie Spivak band, which led him out to California for the first time, to make a band picture. Hefti fell in love with California. After making the picture in Los Angeles, he dropped out of the Spivak band to stay in California.

==First Herd==


After playing with Horace Heidt in Los Angeles for a few months in 1944, Hefti met up with Woody Herman who was out in California making a band picture. Hefti then joined Herman&#x27;s progressive First Herd band as a trumpeter. The Herman band was different from any band that he had played with before. He referred to it as his first experience with a real jazz band. He said:
I would say that I got into jazz when I got into Woody Herman&#x27;s band because that band was sorta jazz-oriented. They had records. It was the first band I ever joined where the musicians carried records on the road... Duke Ellington records... Woody Herman discs [and] Charlie Barnet V-Discs... That&#x27;s the first time I sort of got into jazz. The first time I sort of felt that I was anything remotely connected with jazz.
Even though he had been playing with swing bands and other popular music bands for five years, this was the first time he had been immersed in the music of Duke Ellington, and this was the first music that really felt like jazz to him.

One of the first big bands to embrace bebop, First Herd incorporated many bebop ideas in their music. Hefti was instrumental in this development, drawing from his experiences in New York and his respect for Gillespie, who had his own bebop big band. Chubby Jackson, First Herd&#x27;s bassist, said
Neal started to write some of his ensembles with some of the figures that come from that early bebop thing. We were really one of the first bands outside of Dizzy&#x27;s big band that flavored bebop into the big band — different tonal quality and rhythms, and the drum feeling started changing, and that I think was really the beginning of it...

I fell in love with it, and I finally got into playing it with the big band because Neal had it down. Neal would write some beautiful things along those patterns.

During these years with Herman&#x27;s band, as they started to turn more and more towards bop ideas, Hefti started to turn more of his attention and effort to writing, at which he quickly excelled. He composed and arranged some of First Herd&#x27;s most popular recordings, including two of the band&#x27;s finest instrumentals: &quot;Wild Root&quot; and &quot;The Good Earth&quot;.
He contributed to the band a refinement of bop trumpet style that reflected his experience with Byrne, Barnet, and Spivak, as well as an unusually imaginative mind, essentially restless on the trumpet, but beautifully grounded on manuscript paper.

He also wrote band favorites such as &quot;Apple Honey&quot; and &quot;Blowin&#x27; Up a Storm&quot;. His first hand experience in New York, hanging around 52nd Street and listening to the great Dizzy Gillespie, became an important resource to the whole band.

His bebop composition work also started to attract outside attention from other composers, including the interest of neo-classicist Igor Stravinsky, who later wrote &quot;Ebony Concerto&quot; for the band.

What first attracted Stravinsky to Herman was the five trumpet unison on &quot;Caldonia,&quot; which mirrored the new music of Gillespie... First it had been [Neal Hefti&#x27;s] solo on Herman&#x27;s &quot;Woodchopper&#x27;s Ball&quot;, then it became the property of the whole section, and finally, in this set form, it was made part of [Hefti&#x27;s] arrangement of &quot;Caldonia.&quot;

Hefti&#x27;s work successfully drew from many sources. As composer, arranger, and as a crucial part of the Herman ensemble, he provided the Herman band with a solid base which led to their popularity and mastery of the big band bebop style.

==Late 1940s==
While playing with the First Herd, Neal married Herman&#x27;s vocalist, Frances Wayne. Playing with the band was very enjoyable for Hefti, which made it doubly hard for him to leave when he wanted to pursue arranging and composing full-time. Talking about Herman&#x27;s band, Hefti said,

The band was a lot of fun. I think there was great rapport between the people in it. And none of us wanted to leave. We were always getting sort of offers from other bands for much more money than we were making with Woody, and it was always like if you left, you were a rat. You were really letting down the team.
The Heftis finally left Woody Herman in late 1946, and Neal began freelance arranging. He wrote charts for Buddy Rich&#x27;s band, and the ill-fated Billy Butterfield band. He wrote a few arrangements and compositions for George Auld&#x27;s band, including the composition &quot;Mo Mo.&quot; He joined the short-lived Charlie Ventura band as both sideman and arranger (arranging popular songs such as &quot;How High the Moon&quot;). He also arranged for Harry James&#x27;s bands in the late 1940s.

One of the serendipitous highlights of his work in the late 1940s was the recording of his Cuban-influenced song &quot;Repetition&quot; using a big band and string orchestra, for an anthology collection called &quot;The Jazz Scene&quot; intended to showcase the best jazz artists around at that time. Hefti had written the piece with no soloist in mind, but Charlie Parker was in the studio while Hefti was recording, heard the arrangement, and asked to be included as soloist. In the liner notes to the original issue, producer Norman Granz wrote:

Parker actually plays on top of the original arrangement: that it gels as well as it does, is a tribute both to the flexible arrangement of Hefti and the inventive genius of Parker to adapt himself to any musical surrounding.
==The Basie years==
In 1950, Hefti began to arrange for Count Basie and what became known as &quot;The New Testament&quot; band. According to Hefti in a &quot;Billboard&quot; interview, Basie wanted to develop a stage band that could appear on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Although the New Testament band was never a show band, it was much more of an ensemble band than Basie&#x27;s previous orchestras. Hefti&#x27;s tight, well-crafted arrangements resulted in a new band identity that was maintained for more than twenty years. In his autobiography, Count Basie recalls their first meeting and the first compositions that Hefti provided the new band:

Neal came by, and we had a talk, and he said he&#x27;d just like to put something in the book. Then he came back with &quot;Little Pony&quot; and then &quot;Sure Thing,&quot; &quot;Why Not?&quot; and &quot;Fawncy Meeting You,&quot; and we ran them down, and that&#x27;s how we got married.
Hefti&#x27;s compositions and arrangements featured and recorded by the orchestra established the distinctive, tighter, modern sound of the later Basie. His work was welcomed by both the band and with audiences. Basie said: &quot;There is something of his on each one of those first albums of that new band.&quot;

What has become known as &quot;The Atomic Mr. Basie&quot; was one of the Basie Orchestra&#x27;s most successful recordings of the 1950s. Formally titled &quot;Basie&quot; and subtitled &quot;E=MC²=Count Basie Orchestra+Neal Hefti Arrangements,&quot; the album features eleven songs composed and arranged by Hefti, including the ballad &quot;Li&#x27;l Darlin&quot; and &quot;Splanky,&quot; now standards. Also on the album were &quot;The Kid from Red Bank&quot; featuring a gloriously sparse piano solo that was Basie&#x27;s hallmark, and other songs that quickly became Basie favorites, such as &quot;Flight of the Foo Birds&quot; with Eddie Lockjaw Davis&#x27; flying tenor solo, &quot;Fantail&quot; with Frank Wess&#x27;s soaring alto solo, and the masterpiece ensemble lines of &quot;Teddy the Toad&quot;. These pieces are evidence of both Hefti&#x27;s masterful hand, and the strong ensemble that Count Basie had put together.

During the 1950s, Hefti did not get as much respect as a musician and band leader as he did as composer and arranger. In a 1955 interview, Miles Davis said: &quot;if it weren&#x27;t for Neal Hefti, the Basie band wouldn&#x27;t sound as good as it does. But Neal&#x27;s band can&#x27;t play those same arrangements nearly as well.&quot; This disparity is not so much a reflection of Hefti&#x27;s ability (or lack thereof) as a musician, as it is a reflection of his focus as a writer. In the liner notes to &quot;Atomic Basie&quot;, critic Barry Ulanov says:

In a presentation of the Count Basie band notable of its justness, for its attention to all the rich instrumental talent and all the high good taste of this band — in this presentation, not the least of the achievements is the evenness of the manuscript. Neal Hefti has matched — figure for figure, note for note-blower — his talent to the Basie band&#x27;s, and it comes out, as it should, Basie.

Much the same way that Duke Ellington matched his scores to the unique abilities of his performers, Hefti was able to take advantage of the same kind of &#x27;fine-tuning&#x27; to bring out the best of the talents of the Basie band. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that when the same charts are played by a different band, even the composer&#x27;s own, that the result is not as strong.

As composer, Hefti garnered many accolades. In addition to Ulanov&#x27;s praise, Hefti won two Grammy awards for his composition work on &quot;Atomic Basie&quot; including &quot;Li&#x27;l Darlin,&quot; &quot;Splanky,&quot; and &quot;Teddy the Toad.&quot; The reception this album gained had Basie and Hefti in the studio six months later making another album. Basie recalled:

That is the one that came out under the title of &quot;Basie Plays Hefti&quot;. All the tunes were very musical. That&#x27;s the way Neal&#x27;s things were, and those guys in that band always had something to put with whatever you laid in front of them.

Hefti&#x27;s influence on the Basie sound and his writing for the band was strong enough for Basie to use his talent for arranging even when recording standard jazz tunes with the likes of Frank Sinatra. Basie said,

So we went on out to Los Angeles and did ten tunes in two four-hour sessions [with Frank Sinatra]. All of those tunes were standards, which I&#x27;m pretty sure he had recorded before (and had hits on). But this time they had been arranged by Neal Hefti with our instrumentation and voicing in mind.

Again, by matching the individual parts of the arrangements to the unique abilities of Basie&#x27;s band, Hefti was able to highlight the best of their talents, and make the most of the ensemble.

Overall, Basie was very impressed with Hefti&#x27;s charts, but was perhaps too proud to admit the extent of his influence:

I think Neal did a lot of marvelous things for us, because even though what he did was a different thing and not quite the style but sort of a different sound, I think it was quite musical.
==1950s, 1960s and 1970s==
Outside of his work for Basie, Hefti led a big band of his own during the 1950s. In 1951, one of these bands featured his wife Frances Wayne on vocals. They recorded and toured off and on with this and other incarnations of this band throughout the 1950s. Although his own band did not attain the same level of success as the bands he arranged for, he did receive a Grammy nomination for his own album &quot;Jazz Pops&quot; (1962), which included recordings of &quot;Li&#x27;l Darlin,&quot; &quot;Cute,&quot; and &quot;Coral Reef&quot;.

Later in the 1950s he abandoned trumpet playing altogether to concentrate on scoring and conducting. He had steady work conducting big bands, backing singers in the studio during recording sessions, and appearing on the television shows of Arthur Godfrey, Kate Smith, and others. He worked with Della Reese to adapt and arrange 12 songs for her 1960 album &quot;Della&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy Award.

Hefti moved back to Los Angeles in 1960. Around this time, he began working for the Hollywood film industry and he enjoyed tremendous popular success writing music for film and television. He wrote much background and theme music for motion pictures, including the films &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot;, &quot;How to Murder Your Wife&quot; (1965), &quot;Synanon&quot;, &quot;Boeing Boeing&quot; (1965), &quot;Lord Love a Duck&quot; (1966), &quot;Duel at Diablo&quot; (1966), &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; (1967), &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (1968), and &quot;Harlow&quot; (1965), for which he received two Grammy nominations for the song &quot;Girl Talk&quot;. While most of his compositions during this period were geared to the demands of the medium and the directors, there were many moments when he was able to infuse his work with echoes of his jazz heritage.

In 1961, Hefti became the chief artists and repertoire representative of Reprise Records. That year, he joined with Frank Sinatra on his &quot;Sinatra and Swingin&#x27; Brass&quot; album, where Hefti was credited as arranger and conductor of the album&#x27;s 12 cuts.

Also in 1961, Hefti composed a big band arrangement of Sir Edward Elgar&#x27;s Pomp and Circumstance for Don Everly, who released it under the pseudonym Adrian Kimberly on The Everly Brothers&#x27; Calliope Records label.

He also wrote background and theme music for television shows, including &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. He received three Grammy nominations for his television work and received one award for his &quot;Batman&quot; television score. His &quot;Batman&quot; title theme, a simple cyclic twelve-bar blues-based theme, became a Top 10 single for The Marketts and later for Hefti himself. His theme for &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; movie was reprised as part of his score for the television series of the early 1970s, as well as in a more R&amp;B urban style for the 1982 updated version, and a jazzier version for the 2015 updated version. He received two Grammy nominations for his work on &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; television series.

Following his wife&#x27;s death in 1978, Hefti gradually withdrew from active music making. In later years, he concentrated on &quot;taking care of my copyrights&quot;.

==Death==
Hefti died of natural causes on October 11, 2008, at his home in Toluca Lake, California, at the age of 85.

<text>Major Christopher Reynolds Stone, D.S.O., M.C. (19 September 1882 – 22 May 1965) was the first disc jockey in the United Kingdom.

He was the youngest son of Eton College&#x27;s assistant master and Stonehouse preparatory school&#x27;s founder Edward Daniel Stone. Christopher Stone was educated at Eton and served in the Royal Fusiliers. In 1906 Stone published a book of sea songs and ballads and in 1923 he wrote the history of his old regiment. He became the London editor of &quot;The Gramophone&quot;, a magazine started by his brother-in-law Compton Mackenzie.

Stone approached the BBC himself with the idea for a record programme, which the corporation initially dismissed. Stone managed to convince them though and on 7 July 1927 he started playing records on air. His relaxed, conversational style was exceptional at a time when most of the BBC&#x27;s presentation was extremely formal, and his programmes became highly popular as a result. He wore a dinner jacket and tie when he presented.

In 1934 Stone joined the commercial station Radio Luxembourg (for 5,000 pounds a year) and was barred by the BBC in consequence. He wrote a column reviewing new popular records for the &quot;Sunday Referee&quot; newspaper and appeared in advertisements for Bush radio sets. In 1937, as &quot;Uncle Chris&quot;, he presented the first daily children&#x27;s programme on commercial radio, &quot;Kiddies Quarter Hour&quot; on Radio Lyons. Stone later rejoined the BBC and caused a major row in 1941. On 11 November he wished King Victor Emmanuel of Italy a happy birthday on air, adding &quot;I don&#x27;t think any of us wish him anything but good, poor soul.&quot; This good wish towards the head of a state with which Britain was at war at the time led to the sacking of the BBC&#x27;s Senior Controller of Programmes and tighter government control over all broadcasts.

Stone was an avid record collector; in the mid-1930s he already owned over 12,000. When he turned 75 in 1957 the magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot; praised his pioneering work: &quot;Everyone who has written, produced or compered a gramophone programme should salute the founder of his trade.&quot;

<doc id="284282" wikidata="Q349357" url="?curid=284282" title="Woody Herman">
<text>Woodrow Charles Herman (May 16, 1913 – October 29, 1987) was an American jazz clarinetist, saxophonist, singer, and big band leader. Leading groups called &quot;The Herd&quot;, Herman came to prominence in the late 1930s and was active until his death in 1987. His bands often played music that was cutting edge and experimental; their recordings received numerous Grammy nominations.

==Early life and career==
Herman was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on May 16, 1913. His parents were Otto and Myrtle (Bartoszewicz) Herrmann. His mother was born in Poland. His father had a deep love for show business and this influenced Woody at an early age.

As a child, Woody Herman worked as a singer and tap-dancer in vaudeville, then started to play the clarinet and saxophone by age 12. In 1931 he met Charlotte Neste, an aspiring actress; the couple married on September 27, 1936. Woody Herman joined the Tom Gerun band and his first recorded vocals were &quot;&quot; and &quot;My Heart&#x27;s at Ease&quot;. Herman also performed with the Harry Sosnick orchestra, Gus Arnheim and Isham Jones. Jones wrote many popular songs (including &quot;It Had to Be You&quot;) and at some point was tiring of the demands of leading a band and wanted to live off the residuals of his songs. Herman saw the chance to lead his former band and eventually acquired the remains of the orchestra after Jones&#x27; retirement.

==The Band That Plays the Blues, 1936–1943==
Herman&#x27;s first band became known for its orchestrations of the blues, and was sometimes billed as &quot;The Band That Plays the Blues&quot;. This band recorded for the Decca label, at first serving as a cover band, doing songs by other Decca artists. The first song recorded was &quot;Wintertime Dreams&quot; on November 6, 1936. In January 1937, George T. Simon ended a review of the band with the words: &quot;This Herman outfit bears watching; not only because it&#x27;s fun listening to in its present stages, but also because it&#x27;s bound to reach even greater stages.&quot; After two and a half years on the label, the band had its first hit, &quot;Woodchopper&#x27;s Ball&quot; recorded in 1939. Herman remembered that &quot;Woodchopper&#x27;s Ball&quot; started out slowly. &quot;[I]t was really a sleeper. But Decca kept re-releasing it, and over a period of three or four years it became a hit. Eventually it sold more than five million copies—the biggest hit I ever had.&quot; In January 1942, Herman would have his highest rated single (No. 1 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts), singing Harold Arlen&#x27;s &quot;Blues in the Night&quot; backed by his orchestra. 
Other hits for the band include &quot;Blue Flame&quot; and &quot;Do Nothin&#x27; Till You Hear from Me&quot;. Musicians and arrangers that stood out included Cappy Lewis on trumpet and saxophonist/arranger Deane Kincaide. &quot;The Golden Wedding&quot; (1941), arranged by James &quot;Jiggs&quot; Noble, featured an extended (34 bars) drum solo by Frankie Carlson.

==Be-bop and the First Herd, 1944–1946==
The trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie wrote three arrangements for Herman, &quot;Woody&#x27;n You&quot;, &quot;Swing Shift&quot; and &quot;Down Under&quot;. These were arranged in 1942. &quot;Woody&#x27;n You&quot; was not used at the time. &quot;Down Under&quot; was recorded July 24, 1942. Herman&#x27;s commissioning Gillespie to write arrangements for the band and hiring Ralph Burns as a staff arranger heralded a change in the style of music the band was playing.

In February 1945, the band started a contract with Columbia Records. Herman liked what drew many artists to Columbia, Liederkranz Hall, at the time the best recording venue in New York City. The first side Herman recorded was &quot;Laura&quot;, the theme song of the 1944 movie. Herman&#x27;s version was so successful that it made Columbia hold from release the arrangement that Harry James had recorded days earlier. The Columbia contract coincided with a change in the band&#x27;s repertoire. The 1944 group, which he called the First Herd, was known for its progressive jazz. The First Herd&#x27;s music was heavily influenced by Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Its lively, swinging arrangements, combining bop themes with swing rhythm parts, were greatly admired. As of February 1945, the personnel included Sonny Berman, Pete Candoli, Bill Harris, Flip Phillips, Billy Bauer (later replaced by Chuck Wayne), Ralph Burns, and Davey Tough. On February 26, 1945, in New York City, the Woody Herman band recorded &quot;Caldonia&quot;.

Neal Hefti and Ralph Burns collaborated on the arrangement of &quot;Caldonia&quot; that the Herman band used. &quot;Ralph caught Louis Jordan [singing &quot;Caldonia&quot;] in an act and wrote the opening twelve bars and the eight bar tag.&quot; &quot;But the most amazing thing on the record was a soaring eight bar passage by trumpets near the end.&quot; These eight measures have wrongly been attributed to a Gillespie solo, but were in fact originally written by Neal Hefti. George T. Simon compares Hefti with Gillespie in a 1944 review for &quot;Metronome&quot; magazine saying, &quot;Like Dizzy [...], Hefti has an abundance of good ideas, with which he has aided Ralph Burns immensely&quot;.

In 1946, the band won &quot;DownBeat&quot;, &quot;Metronome&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Esquire&quot; polls for best band, nominated by their peers in the big band business.

Classical composer Igor Stravinsky wrote the &quot;Ebony Concerto&quot;, one in a series of compositions commissioned by Herman with solo clarinet, for this band in 1945. Herman recorded the work at Belock Recording Studio in Bayside, New York. Herman called it a &quot;very delicate and a very sad piece.&quot; Stravinsky felt that the jazz musicians would have a hard time with the various time signatures. Saxophonist Flip Philips said: &quot;During the rehearsal [...] there was a passage I had to play there and I was playing it soft, and Stravinsky said &#x27;Play it, here I am!&#x27; and I blew it louder and he threw me a kiss!&quot; Stravinsky observed the massive amount of smoking at the recording session: &quot;the atmosphere looked like Pernod clouded by water.&quot; &quot;Ebony Concerto&quot; was performed live by the Herman band on March 25, 1946, at Carnegie Hall.

Despite the Carnegie Hall success and other triumphs, Herman was forced to disband the orchestra in 1946 at the height of its success. This was his only financially successful band; he left it to spend more time with his wife and family. During this time, he and his family had just moved into the former Hollywood home of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. One reason Herman may have disbanded was his wife Charlotte&#x27;s growing alcoholism and pill addiction. Charlotte Herman joined Alcoholics Anonymous and gave up everything she was addicted to. Woody said, laughing: &quot;I went to an AA meeting with Charlotte and my old band was sitting there.&quot; Many critics cite December 1946 as the actual date the big-band era ended, when seven other bands, in addition to Herman&#x27;s, dissolved.

==&quot;The Four Brothers Band&quot; and more Herds, 1947–1969==
In 1947, Herman organized the Second Herd. This band was also known as &quot;The Four Brothers Band&quot;. This derives from the song recorded December 27, 1947, for Columbia Records, &quot;Four Brothers&quot;, written by Jimmy Giuffre, featuring the saxophone section of Zoot Sims, Serge Chaloff, Herbie Steward, and Stan Getz. The other musicians of this band included Al Cohn, Gene Ammons, Lou Levy, Oscar Pettiford, Terry Gibbs, and Shelly Manne. Among this band&#x27;s hits were &quot;Early Autumn&quot;, and &quot;The Goof and I&quot;. The band was popular enough that they went to Hollywood in the mid-1940s. Herman and his band appear in the movie &quot;New Orleans&quot; (1947) with Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong.

In 1947, Herman was Emcee and also played at the third Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on September 7, 1947. The Valdez Orchestra, The Blenders, T-Bone Walker, Slim Gaillard, The Honeydrippers, Johnny Otis and his Orchestra, Sarah Vaughn and the Three Blazers also performed that same day.
Herman&#x27;s other bands include the Third Herd (1950–1956) and various later editions during the 1960s. In the 1950s, the Third Herd successfully toured Europe. He was known for hiring the best young musicians and using their arrangements. In the early and mid 1960s, Herman fronted a Herd featuring Michael Moore, drummer Jake Hanna, tenor saxophonist Sal Nistico, trombonists Phil Wilson and Henry Southall and trumpeters like Bill Chase, Paul Fontaine and Duško Gojković. By 1968, the Herman library came to be heavily influenced by rock and roll. He was also known to feature brass and woodwind instruments rarely associated with jazz, such as the bassoon, oboe and French horn.

In concert, as the evening wore on and the crowd started dissipating, Herman would often leave the stage and let the band continue the last set on its own; but Terry Gibbs confirmed that the band never sounded the same without Herman being present.

==&quot;The Young Thundering Herds&quot;, 1970–1987==
In the early 1970s, he toured frequently and began to work more in jazz education, offering workshops and taking on younger sidemen. For this reason, he got the nickname Road Father and the bands were known as the &quot;Young Thundering Herds&quot;. In January 1973, Herman was one of the featured halftime performers at Super Bowl VII. In 1974, Woody Herman&#x27;s band appeared without their leader for Frank Sinatra&#x27;s television special &quot;The Main Event&quot; and album &quot;The Main Event – Live&quot;. Both were recorded mainly on October 13, 1974, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. On November 20, 1976, a reconstituted Woody Herman band played at Carnegie Hall in New York City, celebrating Herman&#x27;s fortieth anniversary as a bandleader. 

By the 1980s, Herman had returned to more straight-ahead jazz but augmented with rock and fusion. Herman signed a recording contract with Concord Records around 1980. In 1981, John S. Wilson reviewed one of Herman&#x27;s first Concord recordings &quot;Woody Herman Presents a Concord Jam, Vol. I&quot;. Wilson&#x27;s review says that the recording presents a band that is less frenetic than his bands from the forties to the seventies. Instead, it takes the listener back to the relaxed style of Herman&#x27;s first band of the thirties that recorded for Decca.

==Timeline of Woody Herman Bands==
==Last years==
Herman continued to perform into the 1980s, after the death of his wife and with his health in decline, chiefly to pay back taxes that were owed because of his business manager&#x27;s bookkeeping in the 1960s. Herman owed the IRS millions of dollars and was in danger of eviction from his home. With this added stress, Herman still kept performing. In a December 5, 1985, review of the band at the Blue Note jazz club for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John S. Wilson pointed out: &quot;In a one-hour set, Mr. Herman is able to show off his latest batch of young stars—the baritone saxophonist Mike Brignola, the bassist Bill Moring, the pianist Brad Williams, the trumpeter Ron Stout—and to remind listeners that one of his own basic charms is the dry humor with which he shouts the blues.&quot; Wilson also spoke about arrangements by Bill Holman and John Fedchock for special attention. Wilson spoke of the continuing influence of Duke Ellington on Woody Herman bands from the 1940s to the 1980s. Before Woody Herman died in 1987 he delegated most of his duties to leader of the reed section, Frank Tiberi. Tiberi leads the current version of the Woody Herman orchestra. Tiberi said at the time of Herman&#x27;s death that he would not change the band&#x27;s repertoire or library. Herman died on October 29, 1987, and had a Catholic funeral on November 2 at St. Victor&#x27;s in West Hollywood, California. He is interred in a niche in the columbarium behind the Cathedral Mausoleum in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

<text>A think-aloud (or thinking aloud) protocol is a method used to gather data in usability testing in product design and development, in psychology and a range of social sciences (e.g., reading, writing, translation research, decision making, and process tracing). 

== Description ==
Think-aloud protocols involve participants thinking aloud as they are performing a set of specified tasks. Participants are asked to say whatever comes into their mind as they complete the task. This might include what they are looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling. This gives observers insight into the participant&#x27;s cognitive processes (rather than only their final product), to make thought processes as explicit as possible during task performance. In a formal research protocol, all verbalizations are transcribed and then analyzed. In a usability testing context, observers are asked to take notes of what participants say and do, without attempting to interpret their actions and words, and especially noting places where they encounter difficulty. Test sessions may be completed on participants own devices or in a more controlled setting. Sessions are often audio- and video-recorded so that developers can go back and refer to what participants did and how they reacted.

== History ==
The think-aloud method was introduced in the usability field by Clayton Lewis while he was at IBM, and is explained in &quot;Task-Centered User Interface Design: A Practical Introduction&quot; by Lewis and John Rieman. The method was developed based on the techniques of protocol analysis by K. Ericsson and H. Simon. However, there are some significant differences between the way Ericsson and Simon propose that protocols be conducted and how they are actually conducted by usability practitioners, as noted by Ted Boren and Judith Ramey. These differences arise from the specific needs and context of usability testing; practitioners should be aware of these differences and adjust their method to meet their needs while still collecting valid data. For example, they may need to prompt for additional information more often than Ericsson and Simon would allow, but should take care not to influence what participants say and do.

== Process ==
A typical procedure of think-aloud protocols would include:

* Design the study and write the guide: Determine the number and type of participant for the study. Generally 5 participants would be sufficient. The next step is to write a guide that ask the participants to complete the tasks intended with clear step-by-step instructions. In the script, there should be reminders to participants to say their thoughts out when performing tasks.
* Recruit participants: The team should set up a screener for eligibility of participants. After contacting the person of interest and setting up meeting details such as time and location, the team could also provide additional information to help participant better prepare for the activity.
* Conduct think-aloud protocol: After stating the purpose and asking for consent, the team should proceed by giving instructions to the participant. Ask open-ended questions and follow-up questions. The team should avoid asking leading questions or giving clues. 
* Analyze the findings and summarize insights: The team should use notes taken during the sessions to generate insights and to find common patterns. Based on the findings, the design team could then decide directions to take action on.

As Kuusela and Paul state, the think-aloud protocol can be distinguished into two different types of experimental procedures. The first is the concurrent think-aloud protocol, collected during the task. The second is the retrospective think-aloud protocol, gathered after the task as the participant walks back through the steps they took previously, often prompted by a video recording of themselves. There are benefits and drawbacks to each approach, but in general a concurrent protocol may be more complete, while a retrospective protocol has less chance to interfere with task performance. Nonetheless, some concurrent protocols have not produced such interference effects, suggesting that it may be possible to optimize both completeness and authenticity of verbal reports.

== Benefits ==
The think-aloud method allows researchers to discover what users genuinely think of your design.

== Related method ==
A related but slightly different data-gathering method is the talk-aloud protocol. This involves participants only describing their actions but not other thoughts. This method is thought to be more objective in that participants merely report how they go about completing a task rather than interpreting or justifying their actions (see the standard works by Ericsson &amp; Simon).

<doc id="284290" wikidata="Q709361" url="?curid=284290" title="Arthur Fiedler">
<text>Arthur Fiedler (December 17, 1894 – July 10, 1979) was an American conductor known for his association with both the Boston Symphony and Boston Pops orchestras. With a combination of musicianship and showmanship, he made the Boston Pops one of the best-known orchestras in the United States. Fiedler was sometimes criticized for over-popularizing music, particularly when adapting popular songs or editing portions of the classical repertoire, but he kept performances informal and sometimes self-mocking to attract a bigger audience.

==Life and career==
Fiedler was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Johanna (née Bernfeld) and Emanuel Fiedler (1859–1944). His parents were Austrian Jewish immigrants. His father was a violinist who played in the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and his mother was a pianist. He grew up in Boston, and attended Boston Latin School until his father retired in the early 1900s, and they moved to Vienna, Austria, in 1910. The family soon moved again, to Berlin, where from 1911 to 1915 young Fiedler studied violin at the Royal Academy of Music (&quot;Hochschule für Musik Berlin&quot;) under Willy Hess. He returned to Boston early in World War I. In 1915, Fiedler joined the Boston Symphony Orchestra as a violinist, under conductor Karl Muck. He also worked as a pianist, organist, and percussionist. Arthur Fiedler was not related to former Boston Symphony conductor, Max Fiedler. 

In 1924, Fiedler formed the Boston Sinfonietta, a chamber music orchestra composed of Boston Symphony members, and started a series of free outdoor concerts.

Fiedler was appointed the eighteenth conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra in 1930. While the position of conductor of the Boston Pops both prior to and after Fiedler tended to be a phase of a conductor&#x27;s career, Fiedler made it his life&#x27;s work, having the position for a half-century.

With Fiedler&#x27;s direction, the Boston Pops reportedly made more recordings than any other orchestra in the world, most of them for RCA Victor, with total sales exceeding $50 million. His recordings began in July 1935 at Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall with RCA Victor, including a world premiere recording of Jacob Gade&#x27;s &quot;Jalousie&quot;, which eventually sold more than a million copies, and the first complete recording of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; by George Gershwin (with Jesús María Sanromá as soloist; around that time they also made the first recording of Edward MacDowell&#x27;s Second Concerto). In 1946, he conducted the Boston Pops in one of the first American recordings devoted to excerpts from a film score, Dmitri Tiomkin&#x27;s music for the David O. Selznick Technicolor epic &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;. RCA Victor released an album of ten-inch 78-rpm discs complete with photographs from the film.

Fiedler&#x27;s June 20, 1947, MM-1147 recording of &quot;Gaîté Parisienne&quot; by Jacques Offenbach was eventually released by RCA as their second long-playing classical album (RCA Victor LM-1001), in March of 1950. He recorded the same music on June 2nd of 1954 in stereo and began making regular stereo recordings in 1956. A number of Fiedler&#x27;s recordings were released as 45-rpm &quot;extended play&quot; discs, beginning in 1949, such as Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Marche Slave&quot; and Ketèlbey&#x27;s &quot;In a Persian Market&quot; (RCA Victor ERA-2). Besides recording light classics, Fiedler also recorded music from Broadway shows and Hollywood film scores, as well as arrangements of popular music, especially the Beatles. He and the Boston Pops occasionally recorded classical works that were favorites, but not considered as &quot;light&quot; as most of the pieces that he conducted. He made but a single recording with the Boston Symphony Orchestra: Dvorak&#x27;s &quot;New World Symphony&quot;. There were also recordings of chamber music by his Sinfonietta. Fiedler and the Boston Pops recorded exclusively for RCA Victor until 1970 (though the label has continued to issue many new Fiedler/Boston Pops compilations and unreleased recordings). When the Boston Symphony Hall contract with RCA ended, the Hall, which included the BSO and the BPO, signed with Deutsche Grammophon for classical releases with co-owned Polydor Records for his arrangements of pop music compositions and then London Records. His last album, devoted to disco, was titled &quot;Saturday Night Fiedler&quot;.

Fiedler was also associated with the San Francisco Pops Orchestra for 26 summers (beginning during 1949), and conducted many other orchestras throughout the world. He was a featured conductor on several of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Standard Hour&quot; programs in 1950 and 1951, conducting the San Francisco Symphony in the War Memorial Opera House; the performances were preserved on transcription discs and later released on audio cassette.

In very rare visiting performances, Fiedler accepted the invitation to conduct Don Caneva&#x27;s John Hersey High School Bands after reviewing their latest recordings. Caneva said, “I was tremendously pleased and delighted when he said he would accept our invitation, after hearing a recent recording of the band.&quot; Fiedler ended up conducting twice for Caneva&#x27;s bands in 1971 and 1972. In the final 1972 performance the band opened the Symphonic Winds portion of the concert with the &quot;Festive Overture&quot; by Dmitri Schostakovich, followed with the &quot;American Salute&quot; by Morton Gould. For the conclusion of this portion, Fiedler chose &quot;The Finale From The New World Symphony&quot; by Anton Dvorak. He also conducted Leroy Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Serenata&quot; with the high school band.
Fiedler had many different hobbies. He was fascinated by the work of firefighters and would travel in his own vehicle to large fires in and around Boston at any time of the day or night to watch the firefighters at work. He was even made an &quot;Honorary Captain&quot; in the Boston Fire Department. A number of other fire departments gave him honorary fire helmets and/or badges. The official biography of Fiedler reports that the conductor once helped in the rescue efforts at the tragic Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston in 1942. An avid sailor, he volunteered during the early days of World War II for the Temporary Reserve of the U.S. Coast Guard and was later a member of the Coast Guard Auxiliary.

Fiedler conducted at the nationally televised opening ceremonies of Walt Disney World in 1971. He also appeared on numerous telecasts on &quot;Evening at Pops&quot;, carried on PBS stations nationwide.

In 1972, Fiedler was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.

Fiedler is best remembered by contemporary audiences for his conducting of the Boston Pops at the outdoor Hatch Memorial Shell on the July 4, 1976, celebration of the U.S. Bicentennial. The rendition of the 1812 Overture led by a jacketless and demonstrative Fiedler, capped by a huge fireworks finale over the Charles River was the climax of all day long network television coverage. The video of the aged but obviously delighted Fiedler puffing out his cheeks to the beat of the music and mugging for his musicians was one of the most talked about images of the country&#x27;s celebration.

In honor of Fiedler&#x27;s influence on American music, on October 23, 1976, he was awarded the prestigious University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit. Beginning in 1964, this award &quot;established to bring a declaration of appreciation to an individual each year that has made a significant contribution to the world of music and helped to create a climate in which our talents may find valid expression.&quot;

On January 10, 1977, Fiedler was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Gerald Ford.

==Personal life==

In 1942, Fiedler married Ellen Bottomley, and they had three children: Johanna, Peter and Deborah Stiles.

In 1994, Doubleday published a book written by his daughter, Johanna, titled &quot;Arthur Fiedler: Papa, the Pops and Me&quot;.

==Death==
In December 1978, Fiedler underwent brain surgery at Tufts Medical Center after suffering congestive heart failure. He recovered two weeks after celebrating his 84th birthday. His final Boston Pops season was in 1979. The season began on May 1 with a concert to mark Fiedler&#x27;s 50th year as the orchestra&#x27;s conductor. The works he conducted at that concert include Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s Overture to &quot;La belle Hélène&quot;, Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;An American in Paris&quot; and &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, and Sousa&#x27;s &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;. Morton Gould composed a work for the occasion: a march titled &quot;Cheers!&quot;. Earl Wild played the piano solo for &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;. The concert was broadcast on WGBH for its &quot;Evening at Pops&quot; program. Fiedler made a valedictory appearance on May 5, with James Galway as a flute soloist. He died two months later on July 10 at his Brookline, Massachusetts, home, aged 84. On July 15, the Boston Symphony Orchestra performed a recreation of the July 4, 1976, concert at the Hatch Memorial Shell. It was conducted by the Boston Pops&#x27; assistant conductor, Harry Ellis Dickson. Fiedler&#x27;s funeral service was held at the Memorial Church of Harvard University and his ashes were interred at St. Joseph Cemetery in West Roxbury.

In 1984, Boston honored him with a stylized sculpture, an oversized bust of Fiedler, near the Charles River Esplanade. This area is home to the free concert series that continues through the present day. Composer John Williams succeeded Fiedler as the orchestra&#x27;s nineteenth conductor. His widow, Ellen Bottomley Fiedler, died October 25, 1984, in Framingham, Massachusetts, at the age of 70.

Fiedler&#x27;s collection of programs, photographs and personal notes are now housed within the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center of Boston University. The university has a reading room named after him; it contains his personal collection of scores and books.

<text>In human–computer interaction, paper prototyping is a widely used method in the user-centered design process, a process that helps developers to create software that meets the user&#x27;s expectations and needs – in this case, especially for designing and testing user interfaces. It is throwaway prototyping and involves creating rough, even hand-sketched, drawings of an interface to use as prototypes, or models, of a design. While paper prototyping seems simple, this method of usability testing can provide useful feedback to aid the design of easier-to-use products. This is supported by many usability professionals.

== History ==
Paper prototyping started in the mid-1980s and then became popular in the mid-1990s, when companies such as IBM, Honeywell, Microsoft, and others, started using the technique in developing their products. Today, paper prototyping is used widely in user-centered design by usability professionals. More recently, digital paper prototyping has been advocated by companies like Pidoco due to advantages in terms of collaboration, flexibility, and cost.

== Benefits ==
Paper prototyping saves time and money, since it enables developers to test product interfaces (from software and websites to cell phones and microwave ovens) before they write code or begin development. This also allows for easy and inexpensive modification to existing designs, which makes this method useful in the early phases of design. Using paper prototyping allows the entire creative team to be involved in the process, which eliminates the chance of someone with key information not being involved in the design process. Another benefit of paper prototyping is that users feel more comfortable being critical of the mock-up because it doesn&#x27;t have a polished look.

There are different methods of paper prototyping, each of them showing several benefits regarding the communication within the development team, as well as the quality of the product being developed. In the development team, paper prototypes can serve as a visual specification of the graphical user interface – and by this means, assure the quality of the software. Prototyping forces a more complete design of the user interface to be captured. In team meetings, it provides a communication base between the team members. Testing prototypes at an early stage of development helps to identify software usability problems even before any code is written. The costs and annoyances of later changes are reduced, the support burden is lowered, and the overall quality of the software or website is increased.

Paper prototyping is a quick way to generate digital ideas by sketching on paper. In tight VPC workshop, quick ideas need to be explored and evaluated. Paper prototyping is usually the preferred tool to generate ideas visually and to evaluate them within the team and with target customers.

== Drawbacks ==
Despite many benefits as a quick and easy way to receive feedback on initial design ideas, this method also has certain drawbacks. One of the most important factors in prototyping is the context in which the prototype is being created. Depending on the current stage of development, a paper prototype may not be the best choice for conveying the proposed design ideas. Paper prototypes should only be used in the beginning stages of the design process – typically as the first form of prototype created – since minimal functionality can actually be expressed on paper. They help flesh out ideas, encourage experimentation with unconventional designs, and provide rapid feedback on basic usability – but ultimately, paper prototypes would not serve as sufficient products to present to clients.

Another large drawback of paper prototypes is the level of imagination required from test participants in interpreting how to interact with the design. Since all interactions are being staged by a facilitator during paper prototype testing sessions, there is a potential for the feedback to be skewed as a result. Users have to imagine what their interactions would look like in a digital space; however, their mental models may not represent how the future state of the interface will actually be implemented. Further, users are often distracted by the whimsical performance of the facilitator as they move components around, as well as by their own acting to fake interactions, which would also impact the quality of feedback.

Lastly, paper prototypes can only be tested in person, since test participants are instructed to physically interact with the prototype by pretending to &quot;press&quot; on buttons or moving components around to simulate how the website would change after an action has been taken. However, with an increasingly digitized world and a movement toward remote work, this poses an obstacle for conducting paper prototype testing. In addition, it is difficult to recruit participants from geographically dispersed areas with the constraint of in-person testing. Consequently, this might create bias in the feedback, since it would be ideal to receive insight into the needs of different, geographically diverse user groups.

==Usage==

Paper prototypes should be considered when the following is true:
* The tools the designer wants to use in creating a prototype are not available.
* The designer wants to make a sincere effort to allow all members of a team, including those with limited software skills, to take part in the design process.
* Tests of a design lead to a great deal of drawings.
* The ideas need to be generated quickly and evaluated in a short period of time.
* There is a co-creation workshop needing customers and designers to generate ideas together.

The most important areas of application of paper prototypes are the following:

;Communication within a team
:One of the major applications of paper prototyping is brainstorming in the development team, to collect and visualize ideas on how an interface might look. The interface is built up step by step, meeting the expectations of all team members. To explore the applicability of the software design, typical use cases are played through and possible pitfalls are identified. The prototype can then be used as a visual specification of the software.

;Usability testing
:Paper prototypes can be used for usability testing with real users. In such a test, the user performs realistic tasks by interacting with the paper prototype. The prototype is manipulated by another person reflecting the software&#x27;s reactions to the user input actions. Though seemingly unsophisticated, this method is very successful at discovering usability issues early in the design process.

:Three techniques of paper prototyping used for usability testing are compositions (comps), wireframes, and storyboards. Comps are visual representations, commonly of websites, that demonstrate various aspects of the interface, including fonts, colors, and logos. A wireframe is used to demonstrate the page layout of the interface. Lastly, storyboards are a series or images that are used to demonstrate how an interface works. These three techniques are useful and can be turned into paper prototypes.

;Design testing
:Especially in web design, paper prototypes can be used to examine the illegibility of a design. A high-fidelity design mock-up of a page is printed and presented to a user. Among other relevant issues, the user is asked to identify the main navigation, clickable elements, etc. Paper prototyping is also the recommended design testing technique in the contextual design process.

;Information architecture
:By applying general and wide paper prototypes, the information architecture of a piece of software or a web site can be tested. Users are asked where they would search for certain functionality or settings in software, or topics in a web site. According to the percentage of correct answers, the information architecture can be approved or further refined.

;Rapid prototyping
:Paper prototyping is often used as the first step of rapid prototyping. Rapid prototyping involves a group of designers who each create a paper prototype and test it on a single user. After this is done, the designers share their feedback and ideas, at which point each of them creates a second prototype – this time using presentation software. Functionality is similarly unimportant, but in this case, the aesthetics are closer to the final product. Again, each designer&#x27;s computer prototype is tested on a single user, and the designers meet to share feedback. At this point, actual software prototypes can be created. Usually after these steps have been taken, the actual software is user-friendly the first time around, which saves programming time.

<text>Crawford Kilian (born February 7, 1941) is a Canadian novelist and a college professor. He is also the former public education columnist for the Vancouver Province newspaper. Kilian holds an undergraduate degree from Columbia University and master&#x27;s degree from Simon Fraser University.

==Biography==

Born in New York City, Crawford Kilian grew up in Los Angeles and Mexico City. He graduated from Santa Monica High School in 1958 and moved back to New York to attend college. Kilian completed his undergraduate career at Columbia University in 1962.

After graduation, Kilian was drafted into the United States Army where he completed a two-year tour of duty. After his tour of duty, he became a technical writer for the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California.

Shortly after he moved to Vancouver, Canada, where he began his education career. Kilian taught in two British Columbia community colleges between 1967 and 2008, of which five months were spent in China from 1983 to 1984.

<text>The Hino da Independência (Portuguese for &quot;Independence Anthem&quot;) is a Brazilian official patriotic song commemorating the country&#x27;s declaration of independence from Portugal. The anthem was composed in 1822 by Emperor Pedro I, the lead figure in the country&#x27;s struggle for independence, and the lyrics were written by poet Evaristo da Veiga.

It was used as the national anthem of Brazil until 1831, when the Emperor abdicated. It is sung on Independence Day celebrations in Brazil.

== Lyrics ==

Usually verses 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 (in italics) are nowadays omitted when the anthem of the Independence is sung.

<text>Poole Harbour is a large natural harbour in Dorset, southern England, with the town of Poole on its shores. The harbour is a drowned valley (ria) formed at the end of the last ice age and is the estuary of several rivers, the largest being the Frome. The harbour has a long history of human settlement stretching to pre-Roman times. The harbour is extremely shallow (average depth ), with one main dredged channel through the harbour, from the mouth to Holes Bay.

Poole Harbour has an area of approximately . It is one of several which lay claim to the title of &quot;second largest natural harbour in the world&quot; (after Port Jackson, Sydney).

==History==

In 1964 during harbour dredging, the waterlogged remains of a 2,000-year-old Iron Age logboat were found off Brownsea Island. Dated at about 295 BC, the Poole Logboat is one of the largest vessels of its type from British waters. Its low freeboard would have limited its use to within Poole Harbour.

Poole was used by the Romans as an invasion port for the conquest of southern England, who established the settlement at Hamworthy, now the western half of Poole. A Roman Road ran north from Hamworthy through a fort at Lake Farm, Ashington, to Badbury Rings, a Roman transport hub. At the time of the Norman Conquest, Poole was a small fishing village.

The port grew, and in 1433 Poole was made Dorset&#x27;s Port of the Staple for the export of wool. Medieval Poole had trading links from the Baltics to Italy. In the 17th century, the town began trading with North America, in particular Newfoundland, and the town became very wealthy. In the 18th century, Poole was the principal British port trading with North America. At the start of the 19th century, 90% of Poole&#x27;s population&#x27;s employment was directly dependent on the harbour, but this dropped to 20% during the century as the railways reached the town, and deep-hulled boats moved up the coast to Southampton, which had a deeper harbour and is closer to London. With regular dredging of a channel through the harbour, it has regained some importance.

During WW2, Poole Harbour hosted seaplane bases.

&quot;Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office&quot; was decided in 1970.

The longest ship to enter the harbour is DFDS/LD Lines 186.5 metre &quot;Norman Voyager&quot; on 15 October 2013, with the second longest being the 167-metre &quot;Armorique&quot; of Brittany Ferries, which arrived in the port for the first time on 2 February 2010. The previous holder of that title was the 151-metre &quot;Bretagne&quot;, which arrived in the port for the first time on 27 February 2007.

On 26 March 2023, an oil spill occurred in the harbour, originating from the oil field at Wytch Farm, run by Perenco. The Poole Harbour Commissioners reported that around 200 barrels of &quot;reservoir fluid&quot; had leaked into Poole Harbour from one of the oil field&#x27;s pipelines. The Environment Agency described it as a &quot;major incident&quot;.

==Geography and islands==

The entrance to Poole Harbour is from the east, via Poole Bay and the English Channel. Entering the harbour, heading west, on either side are the shores of Studland beach (south west) and Sandbanks (in particular, the Haven Hotel and the peninsula, north east). Directly ahead are several islands, the largest of which is Brownsea Island.

Four rivers drain into Poole harbour, the largest being the River Frome, which flows from the west through Dorchester and Wareham. The others are the River Piddle, the Corfe River and the Sherford River.
Following the harbour anti-clockwise, heading north-east passes the built up residential settlements of Poole including Lilliput and Parkstone (east). About north-west of the entrance of the harbour is the entrance to Poole Quay and the Holes Bay (see below). Directly west of the main part of Poole is Hamworthy. Continuing anti-clockwise, heading west around the Harbour are the settlements of Upton and Wareham, as well as the outlet of the River Piddle. This area of water within the Harbour is known as Wareham Channel and includes other places such as Rockley Sands.

Continuing anti-clockwise, now heading south are the majority of the islands within the Harbour as well as several small channels and inlets. To the west is Arne Bay and the Wych channel. The majority of land in this area is heathland, and there are few settlements, as opposed to the eastern part of the Harbour. Directly south is Long Island, Round Island and Ower Bay. Green Island, Furzey Island and Brownsea Island (in that order) are to the east, with Newton Bay and Brands Bay (this area has several oil wells) to the south. This area of water is known as the South Deep. Continuing anti-clockwise comes back to the entrance to the Harbour and to Poole Bay, with Studland beach immediately south-east.

Lytchett Bay lies to the north of the Harbour and flows into it through a narrow channel near the edge of the suburb of Hamworthy. This is fed by the Sherford River.

===Holes Bay===

Holes Bay is a tidal inland lake which lies to the north of Poole Harbour. It is a designated harbour quiet area. The entrance to the bay is a small inlet from the main harbour. Spanning the inlet are two bridges: Poole Bridge and the new Twin Sails Bridge; the latter officially opened in 2012 and cost around £37,000,000. Access to Holes Bay for vessels with an air draft greater than is only possible when the bridges are lifted, which occurs several fixed times daily and sometimes on request. The new bridge is intended to help reduce traffic jams by ensuring at least one bridge is open to vehicular traffic at any one time.

The bay contains Pergins Island, and the South Western railway line runs west to east on a causeway across the bay. To the north of the bay is Upton Country Park.

Holes Bay is the location of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) training school, attached to their Poole headquarters. Uses of the bay include fishing, kayaking and small leisure craft. A large marina known as Cobbs Quay is on the west side of the bay. On its east side the bay runs parallel to the A350.

=== Parkstone Bay ===
Parkstone Bay is named after the suburb of Parkstone. Harbourside Park wraps around the bay.

===Islands of Poole Harbour===

Poole Harbour is the location of a number of islands, of various sizes. These islands include:

*Brownsea Island is near the sea entrance at Sandbanks.
*Furzey Island is south of Brownsea Island.
*Green Island is directly south of Furzey island.
*Long Island is near the Arne Peninsula.
*Round Island
*Gigger&#x27;s Island is in the west of the Harbour near the River Piddle outlet.
*Drove Island is in the south of the Harbour in Brands Bay.
*Pergins Island is in the north of the Harbour in Holes Bay.
*Stone Island lies between Brownsea and Studland. It is a ridge of gravel and sand, possibly the remains of an old recurved shingle spit, which is only visible between high tides, and as such is a danger to sailors. It is now gradually being submerged by rising sea-level.

==Geology==

The harbour lies on a band of weak gravel and clay which is easily eroded by the rivers and sea. This band is bordered by two bands of chalk, the Purbeck Hills and Isle of Wight to the south, and the Dorset Downs and South Downs to the north. The clay extends west up the Frome valley to Dorchester, and would originally have extended east beyond Portsmouth in Hampshire. Before the last ice age the River Frome continued to flow east through what is now the Solent, joining the Stour, Beaulieu, Test, Itchen and Hamble, before flowing into the English Channel to the east of the present day Isle of Wight. A relatively resistant chalk ridge ran continuously from the Purbeck Hills to the Isle of Wight, which the rivers could not break through.

When the glaciers of the north of the island of Great Britain melted, the south of England sank slightly, flooding the Solent valley and Southampton Water to form their characteristic rias (flooded estuaries). About 7,000 years ago, increased erosion from the sea and the increased flow caused by the change in climate broke through the chalk hills, cutting the Isle of Wight off from the Isle of Purbeck and flooding what is now the Solent and Christchurch Bay, leaving Poole Harbour as the estuary of the Frome.

==Marine activity==

Once a major port, freight transport has declined, but the port is still served by regular cross-Channel passenger ferries, with Brittany Ferries offering a passenger and freight service to Cherbourg. Condor Ferries operate to the Channel Islands and St Malo.

Coastal trading vessels are also frequent visitors, unloading various cargos on the quaysides at Hamworthy, and fleet of fishing vessels operates from the south end of Poole Quay. There is considerable leisure usage of the harbour, by a combination of yachts and other private craft, cruise boats that ply the harbour, and ferries that provide a passenger link to Brownsea Island. The harbour is managed by the Poole Harbour Commissioners (PHC), who represent all aspects of commercial and leisure activity in the harbour. Their duties include maintaining the shipping channels for the ferries and cargo vessels, enforcing harbour speed limits, improving port facilities and assisting with nature conservation.

In November 2005 the main shipping channels into the harbour and the Port of Poole were dredged to accommodate modern ferries at all states of the tide. The project was carried out by Van Oord, and on completion the depth had been increased from . Approximately 1.8 million cubic metres of sand and silt were dredged from the approach channels to the Harbour and port, and 1.1 million m3 was made available to the local beaches of Poole, Bournemouth and Purbeck for beach replenishment.

Poole Harbour Commissioners define the main shipping channels, in which leisure craft should take care, as :
*The Swash Channel from the Bar Buoy to the Chain Ferry
*The Haven Channel from the Chain Ferry to 16 buoy
*The Middle Ship Channel, from 16 buoy to Stakes
*The turning basin, off the Ferry Port
*The Little Channel from Stakes to Poole Bridge.
===Marinas===
As well as the commercial activity discussed above, Poole is a major centre for sailing and motor boating.
* Poole Quay Boat Haven is the most central marina, situated immediately east of the Town Quay on the main road through the town centre.
* the Town Quay itself still accommodates larger visiting boats.
* Port of Poole Marina is a little south-west of there, close to the ferry terminal, and for resident and visitors.
* Poole Yacht Club is a little further west, and welcomes visiting boats
* Parkstone Bay Marina together with the private Parkstone Yacht Club are located in Parkstone Bay to the east
* Cobbs Quay Marina is in Upton Bay to the north-west, accessed only when the town Bridge (A350) is opened.
*Salterns Marina is by Lilliput and houses the former Poole Harbour Yacht Club
There is an enormous number of moorings in the harbour, and many places to anchor.

==Ecology and nature conservation==

Much of the north side of the harbour is a built-up area, including the town of Poole, and the conurbation which continues eastwards along the coast. The west and south sides of the harbour and part of the Purbeck Heritage Coast are important wildlife havens, as are the five large islands in the harbour, which are home to the endangered red squirrel. The harbour is an area of international importance for wildlife conservation and is on the Ramsar list. It borders three national nature reserves, including the internationally important Studland and Godlingston Heath NNR, and a number of local and non-statutory nature reserves run by organisations such as the National Trust and RSPB, notably Arne. The mouth of the harbour is partially blocked by Sandbanks, a spit on the north, which is built up and part of Poole, and by Studland to the south, which is another important wildlife area.

The harbour is very shallow in places and has extensive mud flat and salt marsh habitats, as well as muddy and sandy shores and seagrass meadows. Being an extremely popular recreation and tourism area means that the local authorities and organisations have to carefully manage the tourism to prevent damage to the habitats.

The south shore of the harbour, including Wytch Heath and Godlingstone Heath, is open heathland of little agricultural use. During the 20th century there was some afforestation with conifer plantations. Around Wareham Forest in the west this has been for commercial forestry, but on the southern shore the plantations conceal the Wytch Farm oil wells.

Three bird species occur in internationally important numbers: common shelduck, pied avocet and black-tailed godwit. Other notable visitors include spoonbill, Sandwich tern and Eurasian whimbrel. Once rare, little egrets are now seen regularly and in increasing numbers.

On 23 April 2022, ospreys nesting in Poole Harbour produced an egg, the first in southern England in modern times. The successful hatching is the first in 200 years. In August 2022, it was reported that one of the two chicks had been killed in a hawk attack. In May 2023, the only breeding pair of ospreys have hatched their first two chicks of the year.

==Urbanisation and development==

Due to the ever-increasing popularity of pleasure boating in the United Kingdom, the harbour has seen a rapid increase in the private ownership of pleasure vessels over the past decade, most of which are housed in private marinas around the harbour. Due to this increase, Poole has seen a rise in the number of maritime-oriented businesses.

With the popularity of watersports such as water skiing, wakeboarding, windsurfing and kitesurfing, Poole Harbour Commissioners have designated areas within the harbour almost exclusively for sport participation – virtually unrestricted from most regular harbour rules. Poole is also fortunate in that wind conditions are variable; wind conditions can be calm for sports such as wakeboarding, and a short while later strong for sports such as windsurfing. Most of these sports benefit from the harbour&#x27;s generally flat water conditions. As a result, local watersport businesses operate around the harbour.

Poole Tourism has developed and signed a number of trails and circular walks, collectively called the Poole Harbour Trails, as well as the Poole Heritage Cycle Route for cyclists.

A freight-only branch runs from Hamworthy railway station to Poole Docks. However, the line is fenced off at the Poole Docks level crossing with a run-round loop provided at Hamworthy Park. In 2017, it was served by a weekly stone train. As of 2024, this has stopped and the line abandoned.

<text>Crad Kilodney (1948 – April 14, 2014) was the pen name of Lou Trifon, an American-born Canadian writer who lived in Toronto, Ontario. He was best known for selling his self-published books (often with outrageous titles such as &quot;Bloodsucking Monkeys from North Tonawanda, Suburban Chicken-strangling Stories&quot; and &quot;Putrid Scum&quot;) on the streets of the city between about 1978 and 1995.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Louis Trifon (as he was then known) was born in Jamaica, New York, in 1948 to a Greek family. In the autobiographical book &quot;Excrement&quot;, he says that February 13 is his birthday. He graduated from Syosset High School in 1965, then obtained a degree in astronomy from the University of Michigan. Instead of continuing in that field, he took a job at Exposition Press, a self-publishing vanity press based in Hicksville, New York. Many of his experiences in that job, and with vanity publishing in general, shaped his outlook on fiction and provided him with material for many stories. The stories &quot;Three Dead Men&quot; and &quot;A Moment of Silence for Man Ray&quot; (both in &quot;Girl on the Subway&quot;) are examples of this.

He sold a few humor-oriented articles to the Houston Post in 1969, and taking on the name &quot;Crad Kilodney&quot;, published very occasional pieces in &quot;The National Lampoon&quot; between 1970 and 1972. According to information on his unofficial website, Kilodney wrote the first unsolicited short story ever accepted by &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, a science fiction parody entitled &quot;The Day Saturn Crashed into the Earth&quot;. It appeared in their fifth issue.

===Move to Canada, and self-publishing===
Disgusted by Watergate and U.S. culture generally, Trifon moved to Toronto in 1973 where he worked at a number of other book publishers, mostly in their stockrooms. While doing so, he continued to make very occasional sales of short stories and humor pieces to small magazines, but decided that it might be best to reach people by self-publishing his stories (under his own Charnel House imprint) and selling them face-to-face on the street. This he did from 1978 through 1995, publishing 32 books in this manner, using the name Crad Kilodney. Kilodney could generally be found, and indeed was a fixture, on Yonge Street, at the University of Toronto downtown campus and in front of the Toronto Stock Exchange building with a cardboard sign hanging from his neck, holding a book he was selling. His attention-getting signage, always handwritten, might give a book title (e.g., &quot;Simple Stories For Idiots&quot;), or a mocking self-description of his wares (e.g., &quot;Slimy Degenerate Literature&quot;).

The books themselves were usually pamphlet-sized collections of short stories, ranging from 32 to 80 pages in length. More rarely, as with &quot;Terminal Ward&quot; (1983) or &quot;Cathy&quot; (1985) the works were single novelette-length stories; &quot;Putrid Scum&quot; (1991) was Kilodney&#x27;s only full novel. Though the vast majority of the work offered for sale was Kilodney&#x27;s own, he also edited and sold several anthologies under the banner of &quot;Worst Canadian Stories&quot; and &quot;The Charnel House Anthology of Bad Poetry&quot;. Kilodney later admitted that most—although not all—of the &quot;Worst Canadian Stories&quot; material was written by him (&quot;and a group of selected colleagues&quot;) in a range of deliberately awful styles, under a variety of pseudonyms. He insisted, however, that the bad poetry he anthologized had been collected from a number of sources, and it was all correctly attributed (including works by Leonard Nimoy, William McGonagall, Karen Mac Cormack, and at least one poem attributed to Kilodney himself.) Though he sold most of his work on the streets of Toronto, in the acknowledgments section of &quot;Worst Canadian Stories, Vol. 1&quot; Kilodney thanks his sister Carol, noting that &quot;she sells many of my books in her pizzeria in Westbury, New York.&quot;

Kilodney was in a relationship with poet and novelist Gwendolyn MacEwen before she died in 1987.

Kilodney commented that while most writers are inspired by conventionally great literature, he drew inspiration from the exact opposite: the slush pile, the crank letter, and of course the vanity press. He was, however, not interested in being seen as a crank or an eccentric, but simply wanted to find respectable, legitimate work as a writer and be taken seriously for doing so. Nevertheless, he also enjoyed pranks, and in 1988, Kilodney submitted a number of stories by famous writers to the CBC Radio literary competition, many under absurd names. All of the stories were screened out by the jury.

More in line with Kilodney&#x27;s literary ambitions, also in 1988 Black Moss Press issued a &#x27;best-of&#x27; collection called &quot;Malignant Humours&quot;. A follow-up collection (&quot;Girl On The Subway and other stories&quot;) appeared in 1990. These were generally the only Kilodney volumes available in bookstores.

Writing in &quot;The Calgary Herald&quot;, Glen Colbourn called the stories in &quot;Malignant Humours&quot; &quot;offbeat, puzzling and, quite frankly, outrageous ... Kilodney&#x27;s absurdist style and quirky humor will limit his appeal largely to adventurous readers. But those readers will find some entertaining stories in the new collection.&quot;

Other mainstream critics also praised Kilodney&#x27;s fiction.

Writing in &quot;The Windsor Star&quot;, Marty Gervais called &quot;Pork College&quot;one of the funniest books of the year, and it ought to be a bestseller ... But what is &quot;Pork College&quot; all about? Well, it&#x27;s hard to say ... There&#x27;s no high point to it, except perhaps in great one-liners ... but then again, it&#x27;s not meant to develop into anything more than what it Is. And what is that? Just stories of funny bits taking shots at the institutional world. And these are worth reading just for the sheer joy of reading.

Although Evelyn Lau, in an &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; review of &quot;Girl on the Subway&quot; called the book&#x27;s stories &quot;sadly uneven,&quot; she went on to say Kilodney is at his best when his sense of humor steps in, ironic, mocking and laced with sadness ... &quot;The Funeral of Lenny Zeller&quot;, about the joke perpetrated by an English teacher after the death of one of the students he loved, is an absolute treat. It is infused with bright language and a side-splitting hilarity, as well as an underlying quiet bitterness and tragedy ... When Kilodney allows himself, he has sympathy and understanding for people and what makes them work, or not work. In much the same way, &quot;The Simplified Existence of Mr. Duggins&quot; succeeds because the author forgets himself and enters the spirit of another person trapped in a different kind of world. On the whole, &quot;Girl on the Subway&quot; contains a few remarkable gems...

In &quot;The South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot;, Richard Grayson called &quot;Bloodsucking Monkeys From North Tonawanda&quot; &quot;a collection of short stories by Canada&#x27;s funniest fiction writer. The title story is the funniest story I&#x27;ve read in years. Kilodney is an undiscovered genius...&quot;

Kilodney also wrote for a variety of publications, Canadian and otherwise, such as &quot;Only Paper Today&quot;, &#x27;What&#x27; (a literary magazine), and &quot;Rustler&quot; (for which he wrote a monthly column at one point).

In 1991, Kilodney was charged with selling commercial goods without a licence, making him the only Canadian writer ever charged for selling his own writing. In response, Toronto hardcore band (and long time supporters of the Independent DIY ethos) Armed &amp; Hammered released the song &quot;Crad Kilodney Was Innocent&quot; on a 7&quot; single vinyl record.

===Audio recordings===
At various times Kilodney kept a tape recorder with him and recorded quite a bit of bizarre byplay between himself and prospective customers. He then compiled the oddest or most entertaining exchanges into hand-made cassette tapes (&quot;On The Street With Crad Kilodney&quot; Vols 1, 2, 3, and 4) which he offered for sale alongside his books. They are extremely rare and are collector&#x27;s items (much as original printings of his books are).

Vol. 3 (a 90-minute cassette) is from 1991. &quot;Dub 154&quot; of this tape, a representative example, includes photocopied typewritten notes detailing the recording process, transfer technique and equipment used. Kilodney handwrote with ballpoint pen on the cassette jacket as well. Side A has 11 recordings, Side B 16 recordings; four of the recordings are answering machine messages, and the rest are the famous surreptitious encounters with people wondering why this man has a sign around his neck. &quot;Excrement&quot; and &quot;Putrid Scum&quot;, as well as several of his stories (such as &quot;Henry&quot;, featured in &quot;Girl on the Subway&quot;) are also inspired by these experiences.

===Retirement from self-publishing and later work===
After receiving an inheritance, Kilodney retired from selling his self-published books in 1995. To continue making income, he took up trading mining stocks, which allowed him to live modestly for the rest of his life. Nevertheless, he continued writing, and looked for new ways to distribute his material. In 1996, Kilodney&#x27;s satirical piece &quot;Circumcision Rites of the Toronto Stock Exchange&quot; appeared in the 1996 Pushcart Prize anthology, and in 1998 his previously published story &quot;Girl On The Subway&quot; was included in the mainstream literary anthology &quot;Concrete Forest: The New Fiction of Urban Canada&quot;, published by McClelland &amp; Stewart. A fan-based website, run by Syd Allan, featured occasional new material from Kilodney up until 2004.

From April 2008 until a few months before his death, new satirical articles (and the occasional short story) were posted on Kilodney&#x27;s blog. A series of 20 articles on &quot;Exotic Cities&quot; that had been published in 2009 were translated into French and collected in the volume &quot;Villes Bigrement Exotiques&quot; (2012). This was the last of Kilodney&#x27;s books published in his lifetime.

Kilodney posted his final blog entry, a short story called &quot;Dreaming With Jay&quot;, in December 2013. He thanked his readers for their support, and noted that &quot;This is the last piece I will publish in my lifetime.&quot;

Kilodney died of cancer on April 14, 2014, at the age of 66. He never married, and left no heirs. The day after his death and at his request, his friend, artist Lorette C. Luzajic, launched the Crad Kilodney Literary Foundation, a website dedicated to preserving and promoting his works. A posthumous collection of his online writings, &quot;Strong Meat&quot;, appeared in 2015.

<text>The Goalkeeper CIWS is a Dutch close-in weapon system (CIWS) introduced in 1979. It is an autonomous and completely automatic weapon system for short-range defence of ships against highly maneuverable missiles, aircraft and fast-maneuvering surface vessels. Once activated the system automatically undertakes the entire air defence process from surveillance and detection to destruction, including the selection of the next priority target.

==Development==
Hollandse Signaalapparaten B.V., in short Hollandse Signaal or Signaal (now Thales Nederland) began work on the Goalkeeper in 1975, developing it around the GAU-8 gun. A prototype, the EX-83, was first demonstrated to the Royal Netherlands Navy in 1979.

In 2012, the Dutch ministry of defense announced that the Goalkeeper systems in use by the Netherlands Navy will receive radar upgrades, mechanical improvements, new high-precision frangible ammunition and a new electro-optical tracking system. Also, the system&#x27;s surface model will be improved to counter high-speed boats and fast attack craft. These upgrades will make the system more capable to defend ships against the latest threats such as modern anti-ship missiles, more effective in littoral environments and less vulnerable to malfunctions. It also expands the life of the system to at least 2025. The first of 16 systems will be upgraded and tested by Thales Nederland, the others at the naval base in Den Helder. The upgrade has been named the Upkeep Modification.

The development of the Upkeep Modification did not go smoothly. The costs associated with the upgrade rose 700,000 euro above the planned budget in 2015, and led to a loss for Thales Nederland in that year. Nonetheless, by 2016 the first upgrade was completed and placed aboard the HNLMS Evertsen for testing purposes. The newly upgraded Goalkeeper system brings numerous improvements and additions to the system. Among these are new color and infrared cameras, a new control panel, new software and computers, and the ability to let several Goalkeeper systems work with each other simultaneously.

In March 2018 the upgraded &quot;Goalkeeper CIWS&quot; passed the sea acceptance trial flawlessly. The Upkeep Modification is meant to bring the performance of the Goalkeeper system once again to the highest operational status, in correspondence with the Royal Netherlands Navy’s ambition to optimally protect its crew and ships during overseas deployments.

==Description==
===Target selection===

The Goalkeeper has two radar sub-systems, one to find threats and another to track and engage them, which operate together to identify and prioritise targets and engage the highest priority one.

The 2D I band search radar, which can handle up to 18 targets at once, generates a threat picture which the gun system uses to identify and prioritize threats. The system has identify friend or foe (IFF) functionality to rule out friendly traces. The tracking radar operates in both I band and K band to enable quick acquisition on the threat bearing. Data from both the I band and K band return signals indicate target range and can be used to identify, and respond to the use of, electronic countermeasures (ECM). The dual-band system also reduces the effect of clutter, which can mask the target at low altitude. A camera system on the assembly provides a visual fall-back for the system operator.

===Target engagement===

The GAU-8/A Avenger 30 mm, also used by the A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft, was selected for the system. The 30x173mm cartridge has a greater projectile mass than the 20x102mm cartridge fired by the Phalanx CIWS M61 Vulcan, so it provides much greater destructive power and significantly increased range with similar muzzle velocity.

The 30x173mm MPDS cartridge has a discarding nylon sleeve (sabot) with a 21 mm sub-calibre tungsten penetrator. The nylon sabot provides a seal between penetrator and barrel and reduces wear.

The tracking radar is capable of monitoring the line of fire and commanding minor adjustments.

Supersonic missiles that are damaged may still have enough momentum to hit the ship—the only way to ensure the protection of the ship is either to detonate the warhead of the missile or obliterate the missile.

The system&#x27;s reaction time to a Mach 2 sea-skimming missile such as the Russian SS-N-22 Sunburn from automatic detection to kill is reported to be 5.5 seconds with the firing synchronized to start the engagement at a range of 1,500 m and ending with a kill at 300 m.

===Operational history===
Goalkeeper&#x27;s capabilities have been proven many times during sea-going trials. During live-fire exercises, many different targets including Harpoons, Exocets and target drones were shot down by Goalkeeper. During anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia the system destroyed several pirate boats and skiffs that had been seized by the Royal Netherlands Navy.

<text>William Patrick Kinsella (May 25, 1935September 16, 2016) was a Canadian novelist and short story writer, known for his novel &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; (1982), which was adapted into the movie &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; in 1989. His work often concerned baseball, First Nations people, and Canadian culture.

==Early life==

William Patrick Kinsella was born in Edmonton, Alberta, the son of Irish Canadian parents, Olive Mary (), a printer, and John Matthew Kinsella, a contractor. He was raised until he was 10 years old at a homestead near Darwell, Alberta, west of the city, home-schooled by his mother and taking correspondence courses. &quot;I&#x27;m one of these people who woke up at age five knowing how to read and write,&quot; he says. 

When he was ten years old, the family moved to Edmonton. He did not go to school until grade five, attended Parkdale School for junior high, and did not attend university until he was in his mid-30s. Kinsella was barely exposed to literature in school, saying in a 2010 interview, &quot;One Shakespeare play and one J. M. Barrie play was the total literature of my high school years.&quot;

Kinsella&#x27;s literary education in his formative years came from reading and by attending all the plays at high school and any theatrical productions that made it to Edmonton. He also worked in the school library his senior year.

As an adult, he held a variety of jobs in Edmonton, including as a clerk for the government of Alberta and managing a credit bureau. In 1967, he moved to Victoria, British Columbia, running a pizza restaurant called Caesar&#x27;s Italian Village and driving a taxi.

Although he had been writing since he was a child (winning a YMCA contest at age 14), he began taking writing courses at the University of Victoria in 1970, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in creative writing there in 1974. He earned a Master of Fine Arts in English at the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. Before becoming a professional author, he was a professor of English at the University of Calgary.

==Literary life==
According to the &quot;Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;, Kinsella&#x27;s literary output primarily consists of two cycles of work dealing with two fictional universes: those dealing with baseball and those depicting the indigenous people of Canada. His first published book was &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot; (1977), a collection of 17 short stories narrated by a young Cree, Silas Ermineskin, who describes life on a First Nations reserve in Kinsella&#x27;s native Alberta. 

A later collection of similar stories, &quot;The Fencepost Chronicles&quot;, earned Kinsella the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour. Kinsella was criticized for writing from the point of view of Native people, with Ojibwe author Lenore Keeshig-Tobias writing in 1990, &quot;W. P. Kinsella&#x27;s Hobbema stories may be insulting. But the real problem is that they amount to culture theft, the theft of voice.&quot; Kinsella said after a heated public exchange with Rudy Wiebe on the topic, &quot;Fiction writers can write about anything they damn well please,&quot; and that he considered the term &quot;cultural appropriation&quot; the nonsense of Eastern Canadian academics. He also considered that much of the humor focused on white bureaucrats on reservations: &quot;The way that oppressed people survive is by making fun of the people who oppress them. That is essentially what my Indian stories are all about.&quot;

Kinsella also wrote nearly 40 short stories and three novels about baseball. &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; (1982), his first novel, blends fantasy and magic realism to tell the story of a poor Iowa farmer who, yielding to voices in his head, builds a baseball field in his cornfield that attracts the spirits of the 1919 Chicago White Sox. The &quot;Iowa Baseball Confederacy&quot; (1986), another book blending fantasy and magical realism, recounts an epic baseball game a minor league team played against the 1908 World Champion Chicago Cubs. &quot;Box Socials&quot; (1991), an evocation of life in rural Alberta during the Great Depression and World War II, has a growing boy as its narrator and recounts a local batting hero&#x27;s hopes of facing a visiting major league pitcher 60 miles away in Edmonton. The Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame awarded him the Jack Graney Award in 2011 for a significant contribution to the game of baseball in Canada.

&quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; remains Kinsella&#x27;s most famous work. The book was mildly controversial for using a living person, the reclusive author J. D. Salinger, as a main character. Kinsella, who had never met him, created a wholly imagined character (aside from his reclusiveness) based on &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, a book that had great meaning to him as a young man. To get a feel for Salinger, he reread his body of work but created an imaginary version of the author. &quot;I made sure to make him a nice character so that he couldn&#x27;t sue me.&quot;

In an example of metafiction, he named &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot;&#x27;s protagonist Ray Kinsella, a character from Salinger&#x27;s uncollected story &quot;A Young Girl in 1941 with No Waist at All&quot;. Salinger also used the surname Kinsella in &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; (Holden Caulfield&#x27;s friend Richard Kinsella, who also shared a name with Ray Kinsella&#x27;s twin brother in &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot;).

Known for his litigiousness, Salinger contacted Kinsella&#x27;s publisher via his attorneys to express outrage over having been portrayed in &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot;. Kinsella denied that Salinger, as a writer, had any real influence on his own writing, despite rumors to the contrary (some said that Kinsella had actually met Salinger).

&quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; won Kinsella the prestigious Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellowship and the Books in Canada First Novel Award in 1982. The book garnered good reviews, sold very well, and was made into a popular movie.

==Adaptations==
W. P. Kinsella&#x27;s novel &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; was made into the movie &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, starring Kevin Costner. The movie grossed nearly $65 million in the United States. It helped establish Costner as a star and was later inducted into the National Film Registry.

Kinsella&#x27;s eight books of short stories about life on reserves were the basis for the 1994 movie &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot; and CBC television series &quot;The Rez&quot;, both of which Kinsella considered to be of very poor quality. &quot;Fencepost Chronicles&quot; won the Stephen Leacock Award for Humour in 1987. The short story &quot;The Last Pennant Before Armageddon&quot; was adapted for the stage by the Live Bait Theater in Chicago in 1990.

Kinsella&#x27;s short story &quot;Lieberman in Love&quot; was the basis for a short film that won the Academy Award for Live Action Short Film in 1996. The Oscar came as a surprise to Kinsella, who, watching the award telecast from home, had no idea the film had been made and released. He was not listed in the film&#x27;s credits or acknowledged by director Christine Lahti in her acceptance speech. A full-page advertisement ran in &quot;Variety&quot; apologizing to Kinsella for the error.

==Career interruption==
In 1997 Kinsella was involved in a car accident that almost ended his writing career. He was struck by a car while walking and suffered a head injury when he hit the ground. He did not publish another novel for 14 years.

In a 1999 interview with the University of Regina&#x27;s student newspaper, Kinsella explained that he could no longer write as he had lost his ability to concentrate. The injury also robbed him of his senses of taste and smell. Kinsella said he went from being a Type A personality to Type B. After the accident, he didn&#x27;t feel like doing the things he had done in his former routine and didn&#x27;t care. He did write book reviews to keep his name before the public.

Kinsella also felt that he was a victim of changes in the book industry during this period, saying in a 2010 interview with &quot;Maclean&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t break into the market today if I was just starting out. The publishing industry is down to a few dozen mainly adventure and romance writers. There&#x27;s still some academic fiction out there, but it has an incredibly small audience. Nobody really cares about it.&quot;

==Later years==
On September 1, 2011, Winnipeg, Manitoba&#x27;s Enfield and Wizenty, a small press specializing in limited-edition hardcover books, released Kinsella&#x27;s first published work in 13 years, &quot;Butterfly Winter&quot;. The unpublished manuscript had won the publisher&#x27;s Colophon Prize the preceding March. The release was backed up by a &quot;modest&quot; book tour, according to the publisher.

The story of Julio and Esteban Pimental, twins whose divine destiny for baseball begins with games of catch in the womb, marks a return to form, combining Kinsella&#x27;s long-held passions of baseball and magical realism. The University of Toronto Press released a trade hardcover edition on October 1. A short story of Kinsella&#x27;s by the same title was included in his 1988 collection &quot;Red Wolf, Red Wolf&quot;, published by Totem Press (Collins Publishers).

A noted tournament Scrabble player, Kinsella became more involved with the game after being disillusioned by the 1994 Major League Baseball strike. He spent his final years in Yale, British Columbia, with his fourth wife, Barbara, occasionally writing articles for various newspapers.

==Death==
Kinsella suffered from diabetes for decades and chose to die with a physician&#x27;s assistance on September 16, 2016, in Hope, British Columbia. He was survived by two daughters and several grandchildren.

==Honours==
* In 1991, Kinsella received an honorary Doctor of Literature degree from the University of Victoria.

<doc id="284306" wikidata="Q806094" url="?curid=284306" title="Bananas in Pyjamas">
<text>Bananas in Pyjamas is an Australian children&#x27;s television series that first aired on 20 July 1992 on ABC. It has since been syndicated in many countries and dubbed into other languages. In the United States, the &quot;Pyjamas&quot; in the title was modified to reflect the American spelling &quot;pajamas&quot;. It aired in syndication from 1995 to 1997 as a half-hour series, then became a 15-minute show paired with a short-lived 15-minute series &quot;The Crayon Box&quot;, under a 30-minute block produced by Sachs Family Entertainment titled &quot;Bananas in Pajamas &amp; The Crayon Box&quot;. Additionally, the characters and a scene from the show were featured in the &quot;Kids for Character&quot; sequel titled &quot;Kids for Character: Choices Count&quot;. The pilot episode was &quot;Pink Mug&quot;.

The concept was inspired by the success of the song &quot;Bananas in Pyjamas&quot;, written by Carey Blyton in 1967, on &quot;Play School&quot;. This song, which had become a regular item on &quot;Play School&quot;, became the theme of the new series. The series was revamped in May 2011 as a CGI animated series created by Southern Star Entertainment.

==Summary==
The main characters are two anthropomorphic bananas named B1 and B2. Other characters include the three teddy bears Amy, Lulu and Morgan, and Rat in a Hat. The bananas, the teddies and Rat in a Hat all live in the same neighbourhood, a cul-de-sac called &quot;Cuddles Avenue&quot;. The bananas live next to the beach and serve as beach patrol. The teddies live next to and look after the park. Rat in a Hat works and lives at the community store. The characters enjoy eating &quot;munchy honeycakes&quot; and &quot;yellow jelly&quot;.

==Production==
===Inspiration===
The characters were inspired by a 1969 song written for children by British composer Carey Blyton (nephew of renowned children&#x27;s author Enid Blyton). The jaunty song describes (an unspecified number of) bananas in pyjamas chasing teddy bears, with a slight twist at the end where a musical sting emphasises that the bananas like to &quot;catch them unawares&quot;. The song was shown on the Australian version of &quot;Play School&quot; for many years accompanied by an animation depicting pairs of bananas in blue-and-white striped pyjamas. This led to a &quot;banana&quot; plush toy being created as part of the &quot;toy cast&quot;, which formed the basis of the physical appearance of B1 and B2.

===Filming===
Creator, producer and showrunner Helena Harris devised the content of the ABC program at ABC Studios. Two of the bear characters, Amy and Morgan, are named after Helena Harris&#x27; children. The show was performed using human actors in elaborate costumes, in the style of the British &quot;Tweenies&quot; and &quot;Teletubbies&quot;. In the show&#x27;s early days, the voices of the bananas were provided by the same actors as were inside the costume, but the original actors eventually gave up that aspect of the show and substitutes wore the hot, stuffy costumes. The show aired new episodes from its 1992 debut to its eventual run in syndication in 2002. The show aired approximately three hundred episodes as well as four specials. Its debut in the United States was in 1995. It made videos and other media from 1995 to 1999. A toy line, developed by TOMY, debuted in 1996.

==Animated version==

On 2 May 2011, a reboot of &quot;Bananas in Pyjamas&quot;, produced by Southern Star Entertainment in full CGI, was premiered on ABC2 in Australia; it was shown in other countries soon after that date. It contains new songs, stories, and characters, including Topsy the cheeky kangaroo, Charlie the inventive monkey and Bernard the wise old dog. Development of the new series commenced in 2009, and production started in early 2010. The new series contains 104 12-minute episodes.

<text>Northern Rhodesia was a British protectorate in Southern Africa, now the independent country of Zambia. It was formed in 1911 by amalgamating the two earlier protectorates of Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia. It was initially administered, as were the two earlier protectorates, by the British South Africa Company (BSAC), a chartered company, on behalf of the British Government. From 1924, it was administered by the British Government as a protectorate, under similar conditions to other British-administered protectorates, and the special provisions required when it was administered by BSAC were terminated.

Although under the BSAC charter it had features of a charter colony, the BSAC&#x27;s treaties with local rulers, and British legislation, gave it the status of a protectorate. The territory attracted a relatively small number of European settlers, but from the time they first secured political representation, they agitated for white minority rule, either as a separate entity or associated with Southern Rhodesia and possibly Nyasaland. The mineral wealth of Northern Rhodesia made full amalgamation attractive to Southern Rhodesian politicians, but the British Government preferred a looser association to include Nyasaland. This was intended to protect Africans in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland from discriminatory Southern Rhodesian laws. The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland formed in 1953 was intensely unpopular among the vast African majority and its formation hastened calls for majority rule. As a result of this pressure, the country became independent in 1964 as Zambia.

The geographical, as opposed to political, term &quot;Rhodesia&quot; referred to a region generally comprising the areas that are today Zambia and Zimbabwe. From 1964, it only referred to the former Southern Rhodesia.

==British South Africa Company==

===Establishment of BSAC rule===

The name &quot;Rhodesia&quot; was derived from Cecil John Rhodes, the British capitalist and empire-builder who was a guiding figure in British expansion north of the Limpopo River into south-central Africa. Rhodes pushed British influence into the region by obtaining mineral rights from local chiefs under questionable treaties. After making a vast fortune in mining in South Africa, it was his ambition to extend the British Empire north, all the way to Cairo if possible, although this was far beyond the resources of any commercial company to achieve. Rhodes&#x27; main focus was south of the Zambezi, in Mashonaland and the coastal areas to its east, and when the expected wealth of Mashonaland did not materialise, there was little money left for significant development in the area north of the Zambezi, which he wanted to be held as cheaply as possible. Although Rhodes sent European settlers into the territory that became Southern Rhodesia, he limited his involvement north of the Zambezi to encouraging and financing British expeditions to bring it into the British sphere of influence.

British missionaries had already established themselves in Nyasaland, and in 1890 the British government&#x27;s Colonial Office sent Harry Johnston to this area, where he proclaimed a protectorate, later named the British Central Africa Protectorate. The charter of BSAC contained only vague limits on the northern extent of the company&#x27;s sphere of activities, and Rhodes sent emissaries Joseph Thomson and Alfred Sharpe to make treaties with chiefs in the area west of Nyasaland. Rhodes also considered Barotseland as a suitable area for British South Africa Company operations and as a gateway to the copper deposits of Katanga. Lewanika, king of the Lozi people of Barotseland sought European protection because of internal unrest and the threat of Ndebele raids. With the help of François Coillard of the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society, he drafted a petition seeking a British protectorate in 1889, but the Colonial Office took no immediate action on it. However, Rhodes sent Frank Elliott Lochner to Barotseland to obtain a concession and offered to pay the expenses of a protectorate there. Lochner told Lewanika that BSAC represented the British government, and on 27 June 1890, Lewanika consented to an exclusive mineral concession. This (the Lochner Concession) gave the company mining rights over the whole area in which Lewanika was paramount ruler in exchange for an annual subsidy and the promise of British protection, a promise that Lochner had no authority to give. However, the BSAC advised the Foreign Office that the Lozi had accepted British protection. As a result, Barotseland was claimed to be within the British sphere of influence under the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891, although its boundary with Angola was not fixed until 1905.

In 1889, although Britain recognised the rights of the International Association of the Congo to large sections of the Congo basin, which formed the Congo Free State under the personal rule of King Leopold II of the Belgians, it did not accept its effective occupation of Katanga, which was known to have copper and was thought might also have gold. Rhodes, possibly prompted by Harry Johnston, wanted a mineral concession for the BSAC in Katanga. He sent Alfred Sharpe to obtain a treaty from its ruler, Msiri which would grant the concession and create a British protectorate over his kingdom. King Leopold II was also interested in Katanga and Rhodes suffered one of his few setbacks when, in April 1891, a Belgian expedition led by Paul Le Marinel obtained Msiri&#x27;s agreement to Congo Free State personnel entering his territory, which they did in force in 1892. This treaty produced the anomaly of the Congo Pedicle.

===Fixing boundaries===

The two stages in acquiring territory in Africa after the Congress of Berlin were, firstly, to enter into treaties with local rulers and, secondly, to make bi-lateral treaties with other European powers. By one series of agreements made between 1890 and 1910, Lewanika granted concessions covering a poorly defined area of Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia, and a second series covering a disputed part of North-Eastern Rhodesia was negotiated by Joseph Thomson and Alfred Sharpe with local chiefs in 1890 and 1891.

The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891 signed in Lisbon on 11 June 1891 between the United Kingdom and Portugal fixed the boundary between the territories administered by the British South Africa Company in North-Eastern Rhodesia and Portuguese Mozambique. It declared that Barotseland was within the British sphere of influence, and fixed the boundary between the British South Africa Company administered territory of North-Western Rhodesia (now in Zambia), and Portuguese Angola although its boundary with Angola was not marked-out on the ground until later. The northern border of the British territory in North-Eastern Rhodesia and the British Central Africa Protectorate was agreed as part of an Anglo-German Convention in 1890, which also fixed the very short boundary between North-Western Rhodesia and German South-West Africa, now Namibia. The boundary between the Congo Free State and British territory was fixed by a treaty in 1894, although there were some minor adjustments up to the 1930s.

Boundaries with other British territories were fixed by Orders-in-Council. The border between the British Central Africa Protectorate and North-Eastern Rhodesia was fixed in 1891 at the drainage divide between Lake Malawi and the Luangwa River, and that between North-Western Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia became the Zambezi River in 1898.

===BSAC administration===

The area of what became Northern Rhodesia, including Barotseland and land as far as Nyasaland to the east and to Katanga and Lake Tanganyika to the north, was placed under BSAC administration by an Order-in-Council of 9 May 1891, but no BSAC Administrator was sent to Barotseland until 1895, and the first Administrator, Forbes, who remained until 1897, did little to establish an administration there. Before 1911, Northern Rhodesia was administered as two separate territories, Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia. The former was recognised as British territory by the Barotseland and North-Western Rhodesia Order-in-Council of 1899 and the latter by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order-in-Council of 1900. Both Orders-in-Council regularised the position of the BSAC Administrators, the first of whom were appointed in 1895. Both Order-in-Councils confirmed that the territories had the status of protectorates, with the Colonial Office ultimately responsible for the welfare of their indigenous populations, despite BSAC administration. The Colonial Office retained the ultimate responsibility for these territory, and the High Commissioner for South Africa had the power to approve or reject all BSAC legislation.

At first, Harry Johnston in Nyasaland was the local representative of the Colonial Office and the High Commissioner. Rhodes financed much of the British presence in Nyasaland and worked closely with Johnston and his successor, Alfred Sharpe, so he could use them as emissaries and their Nyasaland troops as enforcers, particularly in North-Eastern Rhodesia. This territory and North-Western Rhodesia were considered by Rhodes and his colonisers to be a &quot;tropical dependency&quot; rather than a northward extension of white-settler controlled southern Africa. In 1895, Rhodes asked his American scout Frederick Russell Burnham to look for minerals and ways to improve river navigation in the region, and it was during this trek that Burnham discovered major copper deposits along the Kafue River. In 1911 the BSAC merged the two territories as &#x27;Northern Rhodesia&#x27;.

Under British South Africa Company rule, the company-appointed Administrator had powers similar to those of the governor of a British colony or protectorate, except that certain decisions of the Administrator affecting Europeans had to be approved by the High Commissioner for South Africa to be valid. The High Commissioner could also make, alter or repeal proclamations for the administration of justice, taxation, and public order without reference to the Administrator, although this power was never used. In this period the Administrator was assisted neither by an Executive Council nor a Legislative council, as was common in British-ruled territories. There was an Advisory Council, which fulfilled most of the functions of such bodies, and which until 1917 consisted entirely of senior officials. There was no obligation for the company to form a body to consult residents, but after 1917 nominees were added to represent the small European minority: Northern Rhodesia had no elected representation while under BSAC rule. There were five nominated members: four represented the former North-Western Rhodesia and one represented North-Eastern Rhodesia.

Hut tax was first collected in North-Eastern Rhodesia in 1901 and was slowly extended through North-Western Rhodesia between 1904 and 1913. It was charged at different rates in different districts but was supposed to be equivalent to two months&#x27; wages, to encourage or force local Africans into the system of wage labour. Its introduction generally caused little unrest, and any protests were quickly suppressed. Before 1920, it was commonly charged at five shillings a year, but in 1920 the rate of hut tax was sharply increased, and often doubled, to provide more workers for the Southern Rhodesian mines, particularly the coal mines of Wankie. At this time the Company considered the principal economic benefit of Northern Rhodesia to be as a reservoir for migrant labour which could be called upon for Southern Rhodesia.

===Law and security===

British common law became the basis of the administration of Southern and Northern Rhodesia, unlike Roman Dutch law which applied in South Africa. In 1889, the British South African Company was given the power to establish a police force and administer justice within Northern Rhodesia. In the case of African natives appearing before courts, the Company was instructed to have regard to the customs and laws of their tribe or nation. An Order in Council of 1900 created the High Court of North-Eastern Rhodesia which took control of civil and criminal justice; it was not until 1906 that North-Western Rhodesia received the same. In 1911 the two were amalgamated into the High Court of Northern Rhodesia.

The British South African Company considered that its territory north of the Zambezi was more suitable for a largely African police force than a European one. However, at first, the British South Africa Police patrolled the north of the Zambezi in North Western Rhodesia, although its European troops were expensive and prone to diseases. This force and its replacements were paramilitaries, although there was a small force of European civil police in the towns. The British South Africa Police were replaced by the Barotse Native Police force, which was formed in 1902 (other sources date this as 1899 or 1901). This had a high proportion of European NCOs as well as all European officers and was merged with the civil police to form the Northern Rhodesia Police in 1911. Initially, Harry Johnston in the British Central Africa Protectorate had responsibility for North Eastern Rhodesia, and Central Africa forces including Sikh and African troops were used there until 1899. Until 1903, local magistrates recruited their own local police, but in that year a North Eastern Rhodesia Constabulary was formed, which had only a few white officers; all its NCOs and troopers were African. This was also merged into the Northern Rhodesia Police in 1912, which then numbered only 18 European and 775 African in six companies, divided between the headquarters of the various districts.

===Railway developments===
The British South Africa Company was responsible for building the Rhodesian railway system in the period of primary construction which ended in 1911 when the main line through Northern Rhodesia crossed the Congo border to reach the Katanga copper mines. Rhodes&#x27; original intention was for a railway extending across the Zambezi to Lake Tanganyika, but when little gold was found in Mashonaland, he accepted that the scheme to reach Lake Tanganyika had no economic justification. Railways built by private companies needed traffic that can pay high freight rates, such as large quantities of minerals.

A line from Kimberley reached Bulawayo in 1897; this was extended to cross the Victoria Falls in 1902. The next section was through Livingstone to Broken Hill, which the railway reached in 1906. The British South Africa Company had been assured that there would be plentiful traffic from its lead and zinc mines, but this did not materialise because of technical mining problems. The railway could not meet the costs of the construction loans, and the only area likely to generate sufficient mineral traffic to relieve these debts was Katanga. Initially, the Congo Free State had concluded that Katanga&#x27;s copper deposits were not rich enough to justify the capital cost of building a railway to the coast, but expeditions between 1899 and 1901 proved their value. Copper deposits found in Northern Rhodesia before the First World War proved uneconomic to develop.

In 1906, Union Minière du Haut Katanga was formed to exploit the Katanga mines. King Leopold wanted a railway entirely in Congolese territory, linked to the Congo River, but in 1908, he agreed with the British South Africa Company to continue the Rhodesian railway to Elizabethville and the mines. Between 1912, when full-scale copper production began, until 1928 when a Congolese line was completed, almost all of Katanga&#x27;s copper was shipped over the Rhodesian network. The railway&#x27;s revenue from Katanga copper enabled it to carry other goods at low rates. Large-scale development of the Copperbelt only began in the late 1920s, with an increasing world market for copper. Transport was no problem as only short branches had to be built to connect the Copperbelt to the main line.

===The end of BSAC rule===

Almost from the start of European settlement, the settlers in Northern Rhodesia were hostile to the BSAC administration and its commercial position. The company opposed the settlers&#x27; political aspirations and refused to allow them to elect representatives to the Advisory Council, limiting them to a few nominated members. Following a judgement by the Privy Council that the land in Southern Rhodesia belonged to the British Crown not the BSAC, opinion among settlers in Southern Rhodesia turned to favour responsible government and in 1923 this was granted. This left Northern Rhodesia in a difficult position since the British South Africa Company had believed it owned the land in both territories and some settlers suggested that the ownership in Northern Rhodesia should also be referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. However, the British South Africa Company insisted that its claims were unchallengeable and persuaded the United Kingdom government to enter into direct negotiations over the future administration of Northern Rhodesia.

As a result, a settlement was achieved by which Northern Rhodesia remained a protectorate but came under the British government, with its administrative machinery taken over by the Colonial Office, while the British South Africa Company retained extensive areas of freehold property and the protectorate&#x27;s mineral rights. It was also agreed that half of the proceeds of land sales in the former North-Western Rhodesia would go to the Company. On 1 April 1924, Herbert Stanley was appointed as Governor and Northern Rhodesia became an official Protectorate of the United Kingdom, with its capital in Livingstone. The capital was moved to Lusaka in 1935.

Under the Administration of the British South Africa Company, the Administrator had similar powers to those of a colonial governor, except that certain powers were reserved to the High Commissioner for South Africa. There was neither an Executive Council nor a legislative council, but only an Advisory Council, consisting entirely of nominees. The Northern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1924 transferred to the Governor any power or jurisdiction previously held by the Administrator or vested in the High Commissioner for South Africa. The Order also provided for an Executive Council consisting of six ex-officio senior officials and any other official or unofficial members Governor wished to appoint. At the same time, a legislative council was established, consisting of the Governor and up to nine official members, and five unofficial members who were to be elected by the small European minority numbering 4,000 people only, as none of the African population had the right to vote.

==Colonial period==

===Mining developments===

The most important factor in the colony&#x27;s economy was copper. Ancient surface copper workings were known at Kansanshi (near Solwezi), Bwana Mkubwa and Luanshya, all on what later became known as the Copperbelt and exploration in 1895 by the British South Africa Company&#x27;s celebrated American scout, Frederick Russell Burnham, who led and oversaw the massive Northern Territories (BSA) Exploration Co. expedition first established for Westerners that major copper deposits existed in Central Africa. Along the Kafue River in then Northern Rhodesia, Burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits he had worked in the United States, and he encountered natives wearing copper bracelets. Later, the British South Africa Company built towns along the river and a railway to transport the copper through Mozambique.

BSAC claimed to own mineral rights over the whole of Northern Rhodesia under concessions granted between 1890 and 1910 by Lewanika covering a poorly defined area of North-Western Rhodesia or negotiated by Joseph Thomson and Alfred Sharpe in 1890 and 1891 with local chiefs in a disputed area of North-Eastern Rhodesia. This claim was accepted by the British Government. After the Charter ended, BSAC joined a group of nine South African and British companies which financed the development of Nchanga Mines, to prevent them falling under US control. However, its main concern was to receive royalties.

However significant they were, these copper deposits could not be exploited commercially until the Southern Rhodesian railway had extended across the Zambezi and continued northward, to reach the Belgian Congo border, which it did in 1909. By that time, mining had started in Katanga, where rich copper oxide ores occurred near the surface. In Northern Rhodesia, the surface ores were of poorer quality, and copper was only worked intermittently at Bwana Mkubwa until in 1924 rich copper sulphide ores were discovered about 100 feet below the surface. Prior to 1924, there had not been significant exploitation of Northern Rhodesia&#x27;s mineral resources: there was some cattle farming in Barotseland, but Northern Rhodesia had attracted little white settlement, in contrast to its southern neighbour. Unlike Southern Rhodesia, which had seen a flood of fortune-seeking prospectors seeking to set up independent mines, Northern Rhodesia&#x27;s mining policy was to agree large-scale deals with major commercial mining companies.

Large-scale mining on the Northern Rhodesian Copperbelt started after 1924 and was mainly financed from the United States of America and South Africa. Chester Beatty&#x27;s and Sir Edmund Davis&#x27;s Selection Trust already had an interest in the fairly small Bwana Mkubwa copper mine, which had opened in 1901 on the site of ancient mineral workings at the southern end of the Copperbelt, and Beatty was responsible for the development of the Roan Antelope mine at Luanshya in 1926. Copper was becoming much more valuable as more of it was needed for electrical components and the motor industry. In 1927, Beatty sold a one-third interest in Roan Antelope to the American Metal Company (AMC), whose interests were in refining and selling metals, and in 1928 he formed Rhodesian Selection Trust (RST – later renamed Roan Selection Trust) to finance further mining developments. Beatty then sold his controlling interest in RST to AMC in 1930, becoming AMC&#x27;s largest shareholder. AMC&#x27;s commitment to RST allowed it to bring the Mufulira mine into partial production in 1930, although it only became fully operational in 1933, because of the Great Depression.

South African interest in the Copperbelt was led the Anglo American Corporation, which gained an interest in the Bwana Mkubwa company in 1924 and acquired a one-third interest in Mufulira in 1928. Also in 1928, Anglo American acquired control of the Nkana mine at Kitwe and formed Rhodesian Anglo American, whose other shareholders included US and South African finance houses and the British South Africa Company (BSAC). As BSAC exchanged its own shares for Rhodesian Anglo American ones, Rhodesian Anglo American now became a major shareholder in BSAC. Both Roan Antelope and Nkana started commercial production in 1931.

At first, very little British capital was invested in the Copperbelt. However, in 1929 it seemed possible that a fourth source of copper, Nchanga Mines, might fall under US control: as an American cartel which sought to restrict supply to increase prices then already controlled three-quarters of world copper production, the British government encouraged a group of nine &quot;British&quot; companies to finance Nchanga. This group was dominated by Rhodesian Anglo American, so truly British participation was still limited. In 1931 the ownership of Bwana Mkubwa and Nchanga was amalgamated into the Rhokana Corporation, in which Rhodesian Anglo American also predominated. The situation in 1931 was that Rhodesian Selection Trust (RST) owned Roan Antelope and a dominant interest in Mufulira, while Rhokana Corporation owned the remained of Mufulira, Nkana, Nchanga and Bwana Mkubwa. The shareholding structure of RST and particularly of Rhokana was complex.

While at first the existence this cartel encouraged investment, consumers sought alternative and cheaper materials and with the economic downturn, the price of copper crashed in 1931. An international agreement restricted output. This caused a catastrophe in Northern Rhodesia where many employees were sacked and put an end to hopes which many Europeans had held of turning Northern Rhodesia into another white dominion like Southern Rhodesia. Many settlers took this opportunity to move back to Southern Rhodesia, while Africans returned to their farms.

===Economic recovery===

Despite the economic crash, large firms were still able to maintain a profit. The fact that unemployed workers had left meant there were no increases in taxation, and labour costs remained low. At a 1932 conference of copper producers in New York, the Rhodesian companies objected to further market intervention, and when no agreement could be made, the previous restrictions on competition lapsed. This placed the Northern Rhodesians in a very powerful position. Meanwhile, the British South Africa Company sold its remaining Southern Rhodesian holdings to the Southern Rhodesian government in 1933 giving it the capital to invest in developing other mines. It negotiated an agreement between Rhodesia Railways and the copper mine companies for exclusive use and used resources freed up to buy a major stake in the Anglo American Corporation. By the end of the 1930s, Northern Rhodesian copper mining was booming.

===Legislative Council===

====Pre-war====

When Northern Rhodesia became a Protectorate under the British Empire on 1 April 1924, a Legislative Council was established on which the Governor of Northern Rhodesia sat &quot;ex officio&quot; as Presiding Officer. The initial council consisted entirely of nominated members, as no procedure existed at the time for holding elections. However, the members were divided between the &quot;official members&quot; who held executive posts in the administration of the Protectorate, and the &quot;unofficial members&quot; who held no posts.

In 1926, a system of election was worked out and the first election was held for five elected unofficial members, who took their seats together with nine nominated official members. An elector in Northern Rhodesia had to be a United Kingdom citizen, a requirement which practically ruled out Africans who were British Protected Persons. In addition, would-be electors were required to fill in an application form in English, and to have an annual income of at least £200 or occupy immovable property worth £250 (tribal or community occupation of such property was specifically excluded).

In 1929, the number of unofficial members was increased to seven. This failed to meet settler aspirations and in 1937 their members demanded parity if numbers with the nine official members, and seats on the Executive Council, until then wholly composed of officials: this demand was rejected. In 1938, there was the first acknowledgement of the need to represent the opinions of Africans, and one nominated unofficial European member was added for this purpose, replacing one of the nominated officials, so that the official and unofficial members each numbered eight. In 1941 one additional member was added to both the nominated officials and the elected unofficials, for a total of ten unofficials (nine elected) and nine nominated officials.

====Post-war====

In 1945, there was an increase in the number of unofficial European members representing Africans from one to three, and an additional two nominated unofficials were introduced for a total of five. From 1948, the African Representative Council recommended two African unofficial members for nomination by the Governor. 1948 saw the replacement of the Governor by a Speaker, who also sat &quot;ex officio&quot;, and the introduction of two members nominated on the advice of the African Representative Council.

An Order-in-Council coming into effect on 31 December 1953 provided for a new Legislative Council to consist of a Speaker &quot;ex officio&quot;, eight nominated officials, twelve elected unofficials, four African unofficial members nominated by the Governor on the advice the African Representative Council, and two nominated unofficial European members representing the interests of Africans. The nominated officials were identified as the Chief Secretary, Attorney General, Financial Secretary, and Secretary for Native Affairs, and four others.

====1959 Order-in-Council====

1959 saw a large increase in the proportion of elected members. The Legislative Council then consisted of the Speaker and 30 members. All but eight of these members were to be elected: the eight nominated were the same four named posts as before, two others, and two nominated unofficial members (who were not specifically responsible for African interests). These two members were retained to provide that there were some members who could be called upon for Ministerial duties if there were too few elected members willing to do so.

The 22 elected members were organised in such a way as to ensure that there were eight African and 14 Europeans. The electoral roll was divided into &#x27;General&#x27; and &#x27;Special&#x27; with Special voters having much lower financial requirements than General voters so that the majority of Special voters were Africans (the nationality requirement had been varied so that British Protected Persons were eligible to vote). In the towns in which a majority of Europeans lived, there were twelve constituencies; special voters could have no more than one-third of the influence on the total.

In the rural areas where most Africans lived, six special constituencies were drawn. Both general and special voters participated in the elections and their votes counted for equal weight, although the majority of voters were Africans. In the special constituency areas, there were two composite &#x27;Reserved European seats&#x27;, in which special voters were restricted to one-third of the influence. There were also two &#x27;Reserved African seats&#x27; in the areas of the ordinary constituencies, although all votes counted in full.

===Law===

Before the end of BSAC administration, Northern Rhodesian law was in conformity with the laws of England and Wales and its High Court of Northern Rhodesia was ultimately subordinate to those of the United Kingdom. This continued after 1924; all United Kingdom statutes in force on 17 August 1911 were applied to Northern Rhodesia, together with those of later years if specific to the Protectorate. Where Africans were parties before courts, Native law and customs were applied, except if they were &quot;repugnant to natural justice or morality&quot;, or inconsistent with any other law in force.

====Subsidiary Courts====

Below the High Court were Magistrates&#x27; Courts which fell into four classes:
#Courts of Provincial Commissioners, Senior Resident Magistrates and Resident Magistrates. In criminal matters, such courts could impose sentences of imprisonment for up to three years; in civil matters, they were limited to awards of £200 and for recovery of land worth up to £144 annual rent.
#Courts of District Commissioners. In criminal matters, they could impose sentences of imprisonment for up to one year without confirmation by the High Court; they could also impose up to three years&#x27; imprisonment with the High Court&#x27;s consent. Their civil jurisdiction was limited to £100.
#Courts of District Officers.
#Courts of Cadets attached to the Provincial Administration.

Criminal trials for treason, murder and manslaughter, or attempts and conspiracies to commit them, were reserved for the High Court. Civil matters relating to constitutional issues, wills and marriages were also restricted to the High Court.

====Native Courts====

The Native Courts Ordinance 1937 allowed the Governor to issue a warrant recognising native courts. Their jurisdiction only covered natives but extended to criminal and civil jurisdiction. Native courts were not allowed to impose the death penalty, nor try witchcraft without permission. There was also provision for a Native Court of Appeal, but if not established, appeal was to the Provincial Commissioner and thence to the High Court.

===Governing the people===

From the 1890s and until after the end of BSAC administration, a policy of Direct Rule over Africans was operated, within the limits of what was possible with very small numbers of white District Officers. Except in Barotseland, these officers deprived traditional chiefs of their powers of administering justice, and deposed troublesome ones, although most chiefs accepted their reduced role as local agents of the District Officers. By the late 1920s, the idea of Indirect Rule that Lord Lugard had proposed in &quot;The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa&quot; had gained favour. Lugard suggested that, in colonies where climate and geography precluded extensive European settlement, African interests should be recognised as paramount and the development of such colonies must benefit their indigenous population as well as the economic interests of the colonial power. However, what was introduced into Northern Rhodesia in 1930 as a policy of Indirect Rule was little different in practice to the previous policy. Although some legitimate traditional chiefs and other appointed chiefs and headmen were nominated as Native Authorities, they had limited judicial powers and very limited financial resources to build up any institutions of self-government within their communities. Apart from in Barotseland, the District Officers still retained most of their former powers, and used the Native Authorities as intermediaries.

In June 1930, the Colonial Secretary of the Labour Government, Lord Passfield, published his Memorandum on Native Policy in East and Central Africa. His statement of colonial policy was an emphatic reassertion of the principle of paramountcy of African interests, which his predecessor as Colonial Secretary, the Conservative Leo Amery, has attempted to water-down in 1927 when setting up the Hilton Young Commission. Passfield&#x27;s Memorandum stated that no further white minority governments would be permitted, dismissing settler aspirations of self-government in Kenya and Northern Rhodesia. This turned Northern Rhodesian Europeans against association with East Africa towards union with Southern Rhodesia. In 1933, a substantial minority in the Northern Rhodesian legislature favoured amalgamation with Southern Rhodesia, despite vigorous African opposition. However, the majority of settlers were still cautious about being marginalised by the much greater numbers of Europeans in Southern Rhodesia.

From 1943, six Provincial Councils were set up to form a second tier of African representative institutions above the Native Authorities. These were purely advisory bodies, whose advice the Provincial Commissioner need not accept. Most of the members of the Provincial Councils were rural and many were chiefs, but some educated urban Africans were included. In 1946, a third tier was added with the formation of an African Representative Council for the whole protectorate, whose members were nominated by the Provincial Councils. The African Representative Council was also largely advisory, but was later able to make recommendations for Africans to be nominated as members of the Legislative Council.

===Land policies===

In Northern Rhodesia, the British South Africa Company claimed ownership of all the unalienated land in the territory, and the right to alienate it. Europeans occupied land along the line of the railway and near the towns, but at first there was no land shortage, as the population density was low and the European population was small. In 1913, BSAC drew up plans for Native Reserves along Southern Rhodesian lines, outside which Africans would have no right to own or occupy land, but these plans were not put into effect under company administration. However, reserves were created in 1928 and 1929 in the northern and eastern parts of the protectorate, and about half the land adjacent to the line of the main railway line was reserved for European settlement and farming. In 1938, it was reported that the Native Reserves were overcrowded, while much of the land reserved for Europeans was unoccupied and unused.

In 1918, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom had rejected the British South Africa Company claims to unalienated land in Southern Rhodesia, and this raised questions about the company&#x27;s claim to unalienated land north of the Zambezi. However, the company&#x27;s claim in Northern Rhodesia was based on concessions granted rather than conquest and, although a Northern Rhodesian parliamentary Committee in 1921 recommended that these claims also should be referred to the Privy Council, the British government preferred to negotiate an overall settlement for the end of BSAC administration in Northern Rhodesia. This effectively acknowledged the company&#x27;s claim. Under an Agreement of 29 September 1923, the Northern Rhodesian government took over the entire control of lands previously controlled by BSAC from 1 April 1924, paying the company half the net rents and the proceeds of certain land sales.

===Opposition to minority rule===

Firstly, independent African churches such as the Ethiopian Church in Barotseland, Kitawala or the Watchtower movement and others rejected European missionary control and promoted Millennialism doctrines that the authorities considered seditious. They were not generally politically active, but the Watchtower movement was supposedly involved in the 1935 Copperbelt riots, probably incorrectly. Secondly, Africans educated by missions or abroad sought social, economic and political advancement through voluntary associations, often called &quot;Welfare Associations&quot;. Their protests were muted until the early 1930s, and concentrated on improving African education and agriculture, with political representation a distant aspiration. However, several of the Welfare Associations on the Copperbelt were involved in the 1935 disturbances.

Hut tax was gradually introduced to different areas of Northern Rhodesia between 1901 and 1913. Its introduction generally caused little unrest, but in 1909–10 the Gwembe branch of the Tonga people staged a relatively non-violent protest against its introduction, which was severely suppressed. A sharp increase in the rate of Hut tax in 1920 caused unrest, as did the 1935 increase in the tax rate on the Copperbelt.

In 1935, the Northern Rhodesian government proposed to increase the rates of tax paid by African miners working on the Copperbelt, while reducing it in rural areas. Although the Provincial Commissioners had been told about the change on 11 January 1935, it was not until 20 May that the Native Tax Amendment Ordinance was signed, with rates implemented as of 1 January 1935. This retrospective increase outraged the miners, who already had grievances about low pay and poor conditions, and also with the Pass laws which had been introduced in 1927 and required Africans to have permits to live and work on the Copperbelt. It provoked an all-out Copperbelt strike which lasted from 22 May to 25 May in three of the four mines in the area, namely Mufulira, Nkana and Roan Antelope. British South Africa Police were sent from Southern Rhodesia to Nkana to suppress it. When, on 29 May, police in Luanshya attempted to disperse a group of Africans, violence erupted and six Africans were shot dead. The loss of life shocked both sides and the strike was suspended while a Commission of Inquiry was set up. It concluded that the way the increases were announced was the key factor, and that if they had been introduced calmly, they would have been accepted.

One effect of the strike was the establishment of tribal elders&#x27; advisory councils for Africans across the Copperbelt, following a system introduced at the Roan Antelope mine. These councils acted as minor courts, referring other matters to the mine compound manager or district organiser. Native courts operated outside the urban areas and eventually these were introduced to the towns. Mufulira was the first, in 1938, and by the end of 1940 they existed in Kitwe, Luanshya, Ndola and Chingola on the Copperbelt, Lusaka and Broken Hill in the centre of the country, and Livingstone on the border with Southern Rhodesia. Simultaneously, African Urban Advisory Councils were established in the main Copperbelt towns. Relations between Africans and Europeans were often strained.

A second round of labour hostilities broke out in March 1940. This was prompted by successful wildcat strike action by European miners at two Copperbelt mines, who demanded increased basic pay, a war bonus and a closed shop to prevent the advancement of African miners. The European strikers&#x27; demands were largely conceded, including an agreement on preventing the permanent &quot;dilution of labour&quot;. This was followed by a refusal to grant a proportionate increase of pay to African miners, who then went on strike despite the offer of slightly increased bonus payments. The government urged the mine-owners to increase the African miners&#x27; pay, but following a confrontation between workers collecting their pay and diehard strikers, it also tried to force the miners to return to work, using troops of the Northern Rhodesian Regiment. In the violence that followed, the troops fired on the strikers, causing 13 deaths immediately and four later. The Colonial Secretary forced the Governor to hold a Commission of Inquiry, which found that conditions at Nkana and Mufulira had little changed from 1935, although at Nchanga and Roan Antelope no strike had happened. It recommended increases in pay and improvements in conditions, which the mine-owners agreed, and also that African miners should be eligible for jobs previously reserved for European miners. This last recommendation was not implemented then, but was gradually introduced after 1943.

===Second World War===

During the Second World War, Northern Rhodesian military units participated on the side of the United Kingdom. Specifically, Northern Rhodesian forces were involved in the East African Campaign, the Battle of Madagascar and in Burma. Later in the war, the British government&#x27;s Ministry of Supply entered into agreements with the Northern Rhodesian and Canadian copper mines to supply all the copper needed by the armed forces for set prices. This removed free competition and therefore kept prices down; as British companies, the main copper producers were also subject to the Excess Profits Tax. However they did have a guaranteed market, and in 1943 the Ministry of Supply paid half of the cost of an expansion programme planned for the Nchanga mine.

There was an election in 1941; Roy Welensky, a leader in the Rhodesian Railway Workers&#x27; Union who had been elected in 1938, set up the Northern Rhodesian Labour Party as a party favouring amalgamation earlier in the year. All five candidates of the party were elected. This development was spotted in London where Labour Party MPs were concerned that the demand, if granted, would diminish the position of the Africans of Northern Rhodesia. Welensky led a move in the Legislative Council to restrict the British South Africa Company&#x27;s mineral rights which garnered African support; the Company agreed in 1949 to assign 20% of its revenues to the Government, and to transfer all its remaining rights in 1986.

==Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland==

===Early attempts at association===
As early as 1915, the British South Africa Company proposed amalgamating Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia, but this was rejected by the Southern Rhodesian legislature in 1917, as it might have prevented Southern Rhodesia obtaining self-government. This option was again rejected in 1921, for the same reason. After the Southern Rhodesian electorate voted for self-determination in 1922, this objection ceased, and in 1927 the Conservative Colonial Secretary, Leo Amery gave Southern Rhodesia settlers the impression that he supported their claim to acquire the more productive parts of Northern Rhodesia.

At the end of the First World War, the European population of Northern Rhodesia was tiny, about 3,000 compared with ten times as many in Southern Rhodesia, but it increased rapidly after the discovery of the Copperbelt in the 1920s. Northern Rhodesian settlers wanted self-government for the European minority electorate, separate from Southern Rhodesia. However, once the British government appeared to reject the idea of further white minority governments in Africa, talk of amalgamation resumed.

In 1927, the British government appointed the Hilton Young Commission on the possible closer union of the British territories in East and Central Africa. Its majority thought that Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland should seek closer links with East Africa, but the minority report favoured linking these two territories with Southern Rhodesia on economic grounds. Even before the Commission&#x27;s report was published, there were discussions between the Northern Rhodesian settlers and the Southern Rhodesian government on the terms of a total union of the two Rhodesias as a single colony. Northern Rhodesian settlers were only prepared to join Southern Rhodesia if there were no other way to achieve minority rule. When Northern Rhodesia&#x27;s mining industry suffered a major downturn in the 1930s, its representatives pushed for amalgamation in January 1936 at Victoria Falls, but the Southern Rhodesian Labour Party who blocked it, because the British government objected to Southern Rhodesian policies of job reservation and segregation being applied in the north.

Shortly after the Copperbelt strike of 1935 there was an election to the legislative council, in which all candidates supported investigating the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia. After a conference at Victoria Falls between the elected members and representatives of the Southern Rhodesian political parties in January 1936 resolved in favour of amalgamation &quot;under a constitution conferring the right of complete self-government&quot;. The United Kingdom government initially refused to set up a Royal Commission, but following pressure from Europeans in both the Rhodesias, particularly from Godfrey Huggins, who had been the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia since 1933, the British government agreed in 1937 to set up one, as the Bledisloe Commission, whose chairman was Lord Bledisloe. Its terms if reference were to consider a possible closer association between the two Rhodesias and Nyasaland.

===Federation implemented===

The Bledisloe Commission reported in March 1939, and suggested that Africans could benefit socially and economically from European enterprise. However, it thought that two major changes would be necessary: firstly, to moderate Southern Rhodesian racial policies, and secondly, to give some form of representation of African interests in the legislatures of each territory. The Commission considered the complete amalgamation of the three territories, and thought that it would be more difficult to plan future development in a looser federal union. It did not favour an alternative under which Southern Rhodesia would absorb the Copperbelt. Despite the almost unanimous African opposition to amalgamation with Southern Rhodesia, the Commission advocated it at some time in the future, However, a majority of Commission members ruled amalgamation out as an immediate possibility, because of African concerns and objections. This majority favoured an early union of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland into one unit which would co-operate economically with Southern Rhodesia as a possible first step to uniting all three territories later. Northern Rhodesia&#x27;s white population were severely disappointed, but the outbreak of the Second World War fundamentally changed the economic and political situation, as Northern Rhodesian copper became a vital resource in winning the war.

During the Second World War, co-operation between the three territories increased with a joint secretariat in 1941 and an advisory Central African Council in 1945, made up of the three Governors and one leading European politician from each territory. Post-war British governments were persuaded that closer association in Central Africa would cut costs, and they agreed to a federal solution, not the full amalgamation that the Southern Rhodesian government preferred. The first post-war Colonial Secretary from 1946 to 1950, Arthur Creech Jones of the Labour Party, was reluctant to discuss any plans for amalgamation with Godfrey Huggins, the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia because of opposition from Africans and from within his own party. He did not entirely rule out federation, which had been proposed by a conference held at Victoria Falls in 1949 between the Southern Rhodesian government, and the elected, or &quot;unofficial&quot; members of the Northern Rhodesia Legislative Council led by Roy Welensky, without any Africans present. It was left to his successor in post in 1950 to 1951, James Griffiths, to begin exploratory talks with Huggins and Welensky representing the white minorities of both Rhodesias, subject to the opinion of the majority African populations being ascertained. After a change in the British government in 1951, the incoming Conservative Colonial Secretary, Oliver Lyttelton removed the condition of sounding out African opinion in November 1951 and pushed ahead against strong African opposition. After further revisions of the proposals for federation, agreement was reached. Following a positive referendum result in Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia joined the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland when it was created in 1953.

===Opposition to Federation===

In 1946, the Federation of African Welfare Societies was formed, uniting the Welfare Societies that had been set up by educated Africans in towns in the 1930s to discuss local affairs in English. In 1948 the Federation changed its name to the Northern Rhodesia Congress and Godwin Mbikusita Lewanika, who had an aristocratic Barotse background, became its first president. In the late 1940s several local trade unions representing African miners merged to form the Northern Rhodesian African Mineworkers&#x27; Union. Under Mbikusita Lewanika, Congress gradually developed as a political force. It had some radical policies, but Mbikusita Lewanika favoured gradualism and dialogue with the settler minority. In 1950 and 1951 he failed to deliver a strong anti-Federation message and in 1951 Mbikusita Lewanika was voted out of office and replaced by the more radical Harry Nkumbula.

Harry Nkumbula, a schoolteacher from Kitwe, had been given a scholarship to study in London, where he met Hastings Banda. The main African objections to the Federation were summed up in a joint memorandum prepared by Nkumbula for Northern Rhodesia and Banda for Nyasaland in 1950, shortly before Nkumbula returned to Northern Rhodesia. These objections were that political domination by the white minority of Southern Rhodesia would prevent greater African political participation, and that control by Southern Rhodesian politicians would lead to an extension of racial discrimination and segregation. Nkumbula returned to Northern Rhodesia in 1950 to fight against Federation and against Mbikusita Lewanika&#x27;s leadership of Congress. His radicalism caused some chiefs and conservatives to withdraw their support from Congress, but the Northern Rhodesian African National Congress, as the party was renamed in 1951, was able to persuade the African Representative Council to recommend two of its members to be African-nominated members of the Legislative Council in 1951. Shortly after its formation, the Federal government attempted to take control of African affairs from the British Colonial Office, proving the fears of Nkumbula and Banda were justified. It also scaled back the fairly modest British post-war proposals for African development.

The Northern Rhodesian African National Congress had been a rather small, largely urban, party under Mbikusita Lewanika, but Nkumbula used opposition to Federation to increase its membership. In 1951, Kenneth Kaunda, formerly a teacher, became Organising Secretary for Congress in the Northern Province, and in 1953 he moved to Lusaka as Secretary General of Congress, under Nkumbula&#x27;s presidency. The efforts of Congress, including a failed general strike in March 1953, could not prevent the imposition of Federation, and apart from some urban protests, it was sullenly accepted by the African majority. Both Kaunda and Nkumbula began to advocate self-government under African majority rule, rather than just increased African representation in the existing colonial institutions. In addition to demanding the break-up of Federation, Congress targeted local grievances, such as the &quot;colour bar&quot;, the denial of certain jobs or services to Africans and low pay and poor conditions for African workers. Kaunda was prominent in organising boycotts and sit-ins, but in 1955 both he and Nkumbula were imprisoned for two months.

Imprisonment radicalised Kaunda, who intensified the campaign of economic boycotts and disobedience on his release, but it had the opposite effect on Nkumbula, who had already acted indecisively over the 1953 general strike. Nkumbula&#x27;s leadership became increasingly autocratic and it was alleged he was using party funds for his own benefit. However, Kaunda continued to support Nkumbula even though in 1956 Nkumbula attempted to end the campaign against the colour bar. Kaunda&#x27;s estrangement from Nkumbula grew when he spent six months in Britain working with the Labour party on decolonisation, but the final rupture came only in October 1958 when Nkumbula tried to purge Congress of his opponents and assume sweeping powers over the party. In that month, Kaunda and most of the younger, more radical members left to form the Zambia African National Congress, with Kaunda as president.

===End of Federation and independence===

After the defection of Kaunda and the radicals, Nkumbula decided that the Northern Rhodesian African National Congress would contest the Legislative Council elections to be held under the 1959 Order-in-Council in October 1959. To increase the chances of Congress, he entered into electoral pacts with white liberals. Kaunda and the Zambia African National Congress planned to boycott these elections, regarding the 1959 franchise as racially biased. However, before the elections a State of emergency had been declared in Nyasaland and Banda and many of his followers had been detained without trial, following claims that they had planned the indiscriminate killing of Europeans and Asians, and of African opponents, the so-called &quot;murder plot&quot;. Shortly afterwards, on 12 March 1959, the governor of Northern Rhodesia also declared a State of emergency there, arrested 45 Zambia African National Congress including Kaunda and banned the party. Kaunda later received a 19-month prison sentence for conspiracy, although no credible evidence of conspiracy was produced. The declaration of States of emergency in both Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland marked the end of attempts by their nationalist parties to work within the colonial system, and the start of a push for immediate and full independence.

Although Nkumbula and his party won several seats in the October 1959 elections, he made little use of Kaunda&#x27;s enforced absence and managed to alienate another section of the Northern Rhodesian African National Congress who, with former Zambia African National Congress members, formed the United National Independence Party in October 1959. When Kaunda was released from prison in January 1960, he assumed its leadership. Nkumbula and what was left of Congress retained support in the south of the country, where he had always maintained a strong following among the Ila and plateau Tonga peoples, but the United National Independence Party was dominant elsewhere.

Sir Roy Welensky, a Northern Rhodesian settler who was the Federal Prime Minister from November 1956 had convinced Alan Lennox-Boyd, Colonial Secretary from 1954 to 1959, to support Federation and to agree that the pace of African advancement would be gradual. This remained the view of the British cabinet under Harold Macmillan until after the declaration of the States of emergency, when it decided to set up a Royal Commission on the future of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland to be held in 1960. This became the Monckton Commission, which concluded that the Federation could not be maintained except by force or through massive changes in racial legislation. It advocated a majority of African members in the Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesian legislatures and giving these territories the option to leave the Federation after five years.

Iain Macleod replaced Lennox-Boyd as Colonial Secretary in October 1959: he soon released Banda and negotiated a constitution for responsible government for Nyasaland with him, to follow elections in 1961 that would lead to an African majority on the Legislative Council. However, Macleod was more cautious on political change in Northern Rhodesia. A plan for a Legislative Council with an African majority (16 African members to 14 Europeans) was strongly opposed by Welensky, and under pressure from cabinet colleagues, Macleod accepted Welensky&#x27;s proposal for a council of 45 members, 15 of whom would be elected by a largely African electoral roll, 15 by a largely European roll, 14 by both rolls jointly and 1 by Asians. As well as greatly inflating the value of votes on the largely European roll, there was a further requirement in the 14 so-called &quot;national&quot; constituencies that successful candidates had to gain at least 10% of the African votes and 10% of the European ones. This complicated franchise, which also required voters to have a relatively high income, was used in elections of October 1962. In this, Kaunda&#x27;s United National Independence Party gained only 14 seats with around 60% of the valid votes; the mainly European Federal party gained 16 seats with 17% of votes, and Nkumbula&#x27;s Congress held the balance of power with 7 seats: only 37 of the 45 seats were filled, as in many of the &quot;national&quot; constituencies, no party gained 10% of both African and European votes.

Although Congress had arranged before the election with the Federal party that their voters would vote for the other&#x27;s candidates in some &quot;national&quot; constituencies, Nkumbula agreed to work in a coalition which had Kaunda as Prime Minister, and the two and their parties worked in reasonable harmony until a pre-independence election on 1964 where, with a much wider franchise, the United National Independence Party gained 55 of the 75 parliamentary seats. The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was formally dissolved on 31 December 1963, and the country became the independent Republic of Zambia on 24 October 1964, with Kaunda as President.

<text>Thomas King (born April 24, 1943) is an American-born Canadian writer and broadcast presenter who most often writes about First Nations.

==Early life and education==
Thomas Hunt King was born in Roseville, California, on April 24, 1943. He self-identifies as being of Cherokee, Greek, and German descent, but the recognized cheokee tribes, tribes with some of the most detailed genealogy records in the USA, have no recorded documentation to support the claim that he or his father are cherokee. King says his father left the family when the boys were very young, and that they were raised almost entirely by their mother. In his series of Massey Lectures, eventually published as a book &quot;The Truth About Stories&quot; (2003), King tells that after their father&#x27;s death, he and his brother learned that their father had two other families, neither of whom knew about the third.

As a child, King attended grammar school in Roseville, California, and both private Catholic and public high schools. After flunking out of Sacramento State University, he joined the US Navy for a brief period of time before receiving a medical discharge for a knee injury. Following this, King worked several jobs, including as an ambulance driver, bank teller, and photojournalist in New Zealand for three years.

King eventually completed bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees from Chico State University in California. He moved to Utah, where he worked as a counselor for American Indian students before completing a PhD program in English at the University of Utah. His 1971 MA thesis was on film studies. His 1986 PhD dissertation was on Native American studies, one of the earliest works to explore the oral storytelling tradition as literature. Around this time, King became interested in American Indian oral traditions and storytelling.

==Teaching==
After moving to Canada in 1980, King taught Native studies at the University of Lethbridge (Alberta) in the early 1980s. He also served as a faculty member of the University of Minnesota&#x27;s American Indian studies department. As of 2020, King was listed as Professor (retired), Professor Emeritus,
School of English and Theatre Studies by the University of Guelph (Ontario).

==Activism==
King has criticized policies and programs of both the United States and Canadian governments in many interviews and books. He is worried about aboriginal prospects and rights in North America. He says that he fears that aboriginal culture, and specifically aboriginal land, will continue to be taken away from aboriginal peoples until there is nothing left for them at all. In his 2013 book &quot;The Inconvenient Indian&quot;, King says, &quot;The issue has always been land. It will always be land, until there isn&#x27;t a square foot of land left in North America that is controlled by Native people.&quot;

King also discusses policies regarding aboriginal status. He noted that legislatures in the 1800s in the United States and Canada withdrew aboriginal status from persons who graduated from university or joined the army. King has also worked to identify North American laws that make it complicated to claim status in the first place, for example, the US Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 or Canada&#x27;s 1985 Bill C-31. Bill C-31 amended the &quot;Indian Act&quot; in 1985 to allow aboriginal women and their children to reclaim status, which the Act had previously withdrawn if the woman married a non-status man. King claims that the amended act, though progressive for women who had lost their status, threatens the status of future generations because of its limitations.

==Writings==
King has been writing novels, and children&#x27;s books, and collections of stories since the 1980s. His notable works include &quot;A Coyote Columbus Story&quot; (1992) and &quot;Green Grass, Running Water&quot; (1993) – both of which were nominated for a Governor General&#x27;s Award (the former for children&#x27;s literature, and the latter for fiction – and &quot;The Inconvenient Indian: A Curious Account of Native People in North America&quot; (2012), which won the 2014 RBC Taylor Prize. King&#x27;s novel, &quot;Indians on Vacation (2020)&quot;, won the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour in 2021.

King was chosen to deliver the 2003 Massey Lectures, entitled &quot;The Truth About Stories: A Native Narrative&quot;. King was the first Massey lecturer of self-identifying aboriginal descent. King explored the Native experience in oral stories, literature, history, religion and politics, popular culture and social protest in order to make sense of North America&#x27;s relationship with its aboriginal peoples.

King&#x27;s writing style incorporates oral storytelling structures with traditional Western narrative. He writes in a conversational tone; for example, in &quot;Green Grass, Running Water&quot;, the narrator argues with some of the characters. In &quot;The Truth About Stories&quot;, King addresses the reader as if in a conversation with responses. King uses a variety of anecdotes and humorous narratives while maintaining a serious message in a way that has been compared to the style of trickster legends in Native American culture. Within this story, King also integrates the recently popularized idea of turtles all the way down in an anecdote introducing this narrative, calling into the relevancy of this ideology in American and Native American history.

==Politics==
In April 2007 King announced that he would seek the New Democratic Party (NDP) nomination for Guelph district. On March 30, 2007, he was named the NDP candidate. NDP leader Jack Layton was present at the nomination meeting. A by-election was called in the riding due to the resignation of incumbent Liberal Member of Parliament Brenda Chamberlain, effective April 7, 2008. Scheduled for September 8, 2008, the by-election was cancelled with the calling of the October 14, 2008 federal general election. King finished fourth behind Liberal candidate Frank Valeriote, Conservative candidate Gloria Kovach, and Green candidate Mike Nagy.

==Other work==
In the 1990s, he served as story editor for &quot;Four Directions&quot;, a CBC Television drama anthology series about First Nations which was held up by production and scheduling delays before finally airing in 1996. He also wrote the teleplay &quot;Borders&quot;, an adaptation of his own previously published short story, for the series.

From 1997 to 2000, King wrote and acted in a CBC radio show, &quot;The Dead Dog Café Comedy Hour&quot;, which featured a fictitious town and a fictitious radio program hosted by three First Nations characters. Elements were adapted from his novel, &quot;Green Grass, Running Water&quot;. The broadcast was a political and social satire with dark humour and mocking stereotypes.

In July 2007, King made his directorial debut with &quot;I&#x27;m Not the Indian You Had in Mind&quot;, a short film which he wrote.

His book of shorter poems, 77 Fragments of Familiar Ruin includes short poems, many along native themes.

In 2020, his book &quot;The Inconvenient Indian&quot; was adapted by Michelle Latimer as a documentary film, &quot;Inconvenient Indian&quot;.

==Personal life==
His partner is Helen Hoy, a professor emerita of English and Women&#x27;s Studies at the University of Guelph, School of English and Theatre Studies. She has written a study, &quot;How Should I Read These? Native Women Writers in Canada,&quot; (2001). He has three children, Christian (born 1971), Benjamin (born 1985) and Elizabeth (born 1988). The couple resides in Guelph, Ontario.

<text>Félicien Victor Joseph Rops (; 7 July 1833 – 23 August 1898) was a Belgian artist associated with Symbolism, Decadence, and the Parisian , a member of the Les XX group. He was a painter, illustrator, caricaturist and a prolific and innovative print maker, particularly in intaglio (etching and aquatint). Although not well known to the general public and initially sought after as a pornographer, Rops was greatly respected by his bohemian peers and actively pursued and celebrated as an illustrator by the publishers, authors, and poets of his time. He provided frontispieces and illustrations for works by Jules Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly, Charles Baudelaire, Charles De Coster, Théophile Gautier, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Stéphane Mallarmé, Joséphin Péladan, Paul Verlaine, Voltaire, and many others. Best known today for his prints and drawings illustrating erotic and occult literature of the period, he also produced oil paintings including landscapes, seascapes, and occasional genre paintings. Rops is recognized as a pioneer of Belgian comics.

== Biography ==
=== Childhood and education (1833–1857) ===
Rops was born 7 July 1833 in Namur, Belgium, the only child of Sophie Maubile and Nicholas Rops. The Rops were a well-off bourgeois family, their wealth coming from textile manufacturing. Félicien was educated at his home by private tutors until the age of ten; then in 1843, he enrolled in a local Jesuit school for the next five years. His ability to recite lengthy passages from the Bible in Latin attest to both a good education and his intelligence, although even as a schoolboy it is reported that he had &quot;begun to let fantasy dominate his thinking&quot; and received complaints about &quot;his passion for producing uninhibited caricatures of his teachers&quot;. Nicholas Rops died in 1849. After some disagreements between Rops and his mother over the direction of his future education, a compromise was reached, and in June 1849 he enrolled at the Athénée secondary school in Namur while simultaneously attending the Academy of Fine Arts there.

In 1851, Rops moved to Brussels and began studying law at the University of Brussels. However, by 1853, he was attending the Académie de Saint-Luc where he studied drawing and developed his skill as a draughtsman working from live models, meeting others like Louis Artan, Constantin Meunier, and Charles de Groux, and taking part in the local bohemian milieu. It was at this time that he began contributing caricatures, cartoons, and satirical lithographs to student magazines, in particular &quot;Le Crocodile&quot; which brought him some notoriety. In 1856, Rops, along with Victor Hallaux (pseudonym Victor de la Hesbaye) and Charles De Coster progressed from student magazines to founding their own journal, &quot;The Uylenspiegel&quot;, a weekly artistic and literary satirical review to which he contributed one or two lithographs an issue, more than 180 total, furthering his reputation.

=== Early career in Belgium, and marriage (1857–1870) ===

In June 1857, Rops married Charlotte Polet de Faveaux, the daughter of a wealthy magistrate and owner of Thozée Castle (see external links below) in the countryside near the town of Mettet, Belgium. For the first few years at Thozée, Rops enjoyed a comfortable life of a country gentlemen, pursuing passions for painting, botany, and even founding a rowing club in 1862, the Royal Nautical Club of Sambre and Meuse. He spoke highly of his father-in-law in his letters. Rops and his wife had a son, Paul, in 1858, and a daughter, Juliet, in 1859, who died at the age of five. Rops relinquished his managerial roll at &quot;Uylenspiegel&quot; but continued contributing cartoons and illustrations until 1862. He began to explore etching and produced political lithographs, occasional caricatures and cartoons for magazines, and frontispieces and illustrations for books. He illustrated a number of De Coster&#x27;s books including &quot;Légendes Flamandes&quot; (1858), &quot;Contes Brabançons&quot; (1861) and &quot;La Légende d&#x27;Uylenspiegel&quot; (&#x27;Tijl Uilenspiegel&#x27;, 1867). His home became a gathering place for artists, writers, publishers and friends. The &quot;Société Libre des Beaux-Arts&quot; (&quot;Free Society of Fine Arts&quot;) in Brussels was founded in 1868 and Rops served as vice-president for several years. By the 1860s, Rops was traveling extensively and dividing his time between Thozée Castle, Namur, Brussels, and Paris each year; with ever extending time in Paris at the center of the art and literary world, and ever decreasing time at Thozée Castle and Namur with his wife and family as the decade passed.

In 1862, he studied etching with Félix Bracquemond and Jules Ferdinand Jacquemart in Paris and he became a restless experimenter with etching techniques. In later years, with his friend Armand Rassenfosse they developed a new soft ground varnish method which was dubbed &quot;Ropsenfosse&quot;. His activity as a lithographer had ceased by 1865, and although he continued oil painting, etching became his principal medium. He produced 34 frontispieces for books published between 1864 and 1870 and founded the short-lived &quot;International Society of Etchers&quot; (1869–1871).

=== Relationship with Charles Baudelaire (1862–1867) ===
Baudelaire wrote the following tribute to Rops:

Use all your eloquence.../ To say how much I like / That bizarre Mr. Rops / Who may not be a Rome First Prize / But whose talent is as great / As the pyramids of Cheops.

Rops created the frontispiece for Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Les Épaves&quot; (&quot;The Wreckage&quot;) and a selection of poems from &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; (&quot;The Flowers of Evil&quot;) that had been censored in France, and were therefore published in Belgium. Rops first met Baudelaire&#x27;s publisher Auguste Poulet-Malassis in 1862 and was later introduced to Charles Baudelaire towards the end of the poet&#x27;s life. A friendship developed and Baudelaire visited the Rops family at Thozée Castle on many occasions and they traveled together on at least one occasion. In a letter (25 August 1886) discussing Baudelaire&#x27;s writing, Rops wrote: &quot;I lived with Baudelaire for two years. and often served him as a secretary, I never once saw him consult a dictionary. He didn&#x27;t have any, and didn&#x27;t want to have any...saying &#x27;A man who looks up a word in a dictionary is like a conscript who, upon receiving the order to fire, looks for a cartridge in his pouch. In a letter to Édouard Manet (11 May 1865) Baudelaire wrote, &quot;Rops is the only true artist (in the sense in which I, and perhaps I alone, understand the word artist), that I have found in Belgium.&quot; By 1866 Baudelaire and Poulet-Malassis were both in Belgium, in self-imposed exile evading creditors. Baudelaire stated that Rops and Poulet-Malassis were the only persons who &quot;lightened [his] sadness in Belgium&quot;.

It was while visiting Namur, in March 1866, that Baudelaire&#x27;s first symptoms of aphasia and hemiplegia became apparent. Rops invited Baudelaire and Poulet-Malassis to visit his hometown, where Baudelaire had seen and admired the baroque Church of Saint-Loup at Namur (see external links below) before, calling it &quot;the masterpiece of Jesuit masterpieces&quot; and stating the stained-glass windows illuminated the interior like a &quot;terrible and delightful catafalque&quot;. Baudelaire collapsed on the floor while they were admiring the carving on the confessionals there. Baudelaire never fully recovered and died in August 1867 at the age of 46.

Baudelaire left an impression upon Rops that lasted until the end of his life. His association with Baudelaire and his illustrations of his poetry helped increase the visibility of his work and win the admiration of many other artists and writers, including Théophile Gautier, Stéphane Mallarmé, Jules Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly, Joséphin Péladan, Puvis de Chavannes, Gustave Moreau, and Edmond and Jules de Goncourt. By 1870 Rops had made many friends and was living in Paris most of the year and immersed at the heart of literary Paris and the Symbolist and Decadent movements. Taking his cue from Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;The Painter of Modern Life&quot;, he &quot;cultivated the airs of a dandy&quot;. Félix Fénéon was to write of him &quot;Rops: Anoints himself with rouge, dyes his hair and wears a blood-red shirt: looks, or so he hopes, like a sarcastic Satan.&quot;

=== Later career in Paris (1871–1898) ===
The extended months in Paris away from his wife, and his poorly concealed extramarital affairs (described by his biographer Patrick Bade as his &quot;careless contempt for bourgeois family values&quot;) took a toll on Rops&#x27;s marriage by the early 1870s. His wife Charlotte wrote to him in a letter: &quot;Your latest despicable affair, the eighth since I met you and we were married, was your way of punishing others, you killed me! Since you don&#x27;t want to see me any more and asked me not to write to you any more, I want my last word to you to be a word of pardon&quot;. One of his mistresses—Alice Renaud, the woman referred to in his wife&#x27;s letter—was murdered by her jealous husband a few years later, and Rops was involved in the scandal when his intimate love letters to her were read out loud at her husband&#x27;s trial. Although they never divorced, by 1875 Félicien and Charlotte were permanently estranged and Paris was to be his home for the remainder of his life.

However, far from being disheartened, he thrived among the Parisian artists and poets and his critical reputation grew. There was a greater demand than ever for his illustrations in the last quarter of the 19th century by the publishers and authors of the literary vanguard. Rops was prolific and achieved financial success, boasting in 1877 that &quot;he was the best-paid illustrator in France.&quot; He traveled extensively throughout Europe, ranging from the capital cities and art centers, to salmon fishing in Norway and Sweden, back country ventures in Hungary, as well as Spain and Northern Africa. Rops frequently exhibited at the various salons in Paris where the public was both fascinated and shocked by his art and his personal life.

 In the 1860s Rops had developed an acquaintance with a Madame Duluc and her two young daughters, Aurélie and Léontine Duluc (age 14 and 17 respectively at that time). A few years later, not long before the estrangement from his wife, he began a ménage à trois with the sisters, apparently with their mother&#x27;s endorsement. He had children with both, although one child died at an early age; the other, Claire, daughter of Léontine Duluc born in 1871, went on to marry the Belgian author Eugène Demolder. The Duluc sisters ran &quot;Maison Duluc&quot;, a successful fashion house in Paris, for which Rops designed logos and provided advertisements. The three traveled together to the United States and Canada on two occasions to present their fashions. At least one of the sisters served as a model on occasion, and one example was the figure illustrated in Georges Camuset&#x27;s &quot;Sonnet du Docteur&quot; (&quot;The Sonnets of the Doctor&quot;; 1884). The three lived together for over 25 years until Rops&#x27;s death. They ultimately settled in La Demi-Lune, a house he purchased, on the River Seine in Corbeil-Essonnes south of Paris, where Rops continued his passion for botany and developed new varieties of roses in later years. Aurélie and Léontine often combined their names, signing &quot;Auréléon&quot; in their letters and correspondence with Rops.

Rops was invited to join &quot;Les XX&quot; or &quot;Les Vingt&quot;, a group of Belgian artists formed in 1883 which held annual exhibitions and concerts at the Palais des Beaux-Arts and the Museum of Modern Art of Brussels. Founders of the Les Vingt included James Ensor, Théo van Rysselberghe, and Fernand Khnopff among others and were later joined by Anna Boch, Jan Toorop, Odilon Redon, and Paul Signac. Their intention was to protect &quot;true originality&quot; and provide a place &quot;where people are free, not only in fact but above all in thought.&quot; For 10 years &quot;Les Vingt&quot; championed the work of progressive artists and composers of the time including many of the Impressionists, Post-Impressionists, Pointillists, and Symbolists. The French poet Stéphane Mallarmé held Tuesday evening discussions on the arts and literature at his home on 87 Rue de Rome in Paris. These talks became a place of pilgrimage attended by dozens of writers and artists of the time including Rops, Paul Gauguin, J.-K. Huysmans, Édouard Manet, Edvard Munch, Odilon Redon, Paul-Marie Verlaine, and Emile Zola. He maintained his literary associations to the end of his life and in 1896 the literary revue &quot;La Plume&quot; published a special edition tribute volume devoted exclusively to Rops where many of the prominent authors and artists such as Puvis de Chavannes, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Octave Mirbeau, Josephin Peladan, and Jose-Maria De Heredia praised and celebrated his work. Félicien Rops was a freemason and a member of the Grand Orient of Belgium.

Due to an accident with &quot;bichlorate of potassium&quot; in 1892, Rops almost lost his eyesight but he eventually recovered. With his health slowly deteriorating and anticipating legal challenges from his estranged wife Charlotte, his son Paul, and father-in-law, a judge in Belgium, he made a will in July 1896 leaving everything to the Duluc sisters. He spent some time in the south of France with its milder climate on a doctor&#x27;s orders but it provided only a little relief. In time, legal issues did arise and the Duluc sisters successfully disputed Paul&#x27;s attempts to have his father removed from their care, but compromise settlements were made on other issues. Rops died on 23 August 1898 at his home, with Aurélie and Léontine Duluc, his daughter Claire, and some close friends at his side. When notified of his imminent death, Paul traveled from Belgium, but arrived too late to see his father alive. Rops was buried in Essonnes but his body was moved to the family burial grounds in Namur, Belgium eight years later. The following year, he was posthumously awarded the Legion of Honour.

There is now a Museum, &quot;Musée Félicien Rops&quot;, in his home town of Namur, Belgium, housing approximately 3,000 engravings and 500 drawings and paintings. Rops also was a gifted and prolific writer of letters. Referring to Rops, Edgar Degas told Manet &quot;That one writes even better than he engraves [...]. If they ever publish his correspondence, I&#x27;ll sign up for a thousand copies of propaganda&quot; The Félicien Rops Museum has documented and indexed over 4,000 letters so far, over half are currently available online (see External Links below). His correspondences serve as valuable documents and references, not only for Rops and his work, but for the numerous artists, writers, publishers, and other notable culture figures of late 19th century Europe. The biographers of Baudelaire have drawn from Rops&#x27;s letters extensively (e.g.).

== Art ==

Art historians do not consider Rops a seminal figure of late 19th century art, even among the symbolists, and yet no creditable review of symbolism could ignore him either. The French symbolist writers are known to have taken a special interest in his production. He is &quot;the graphic artist most directly identified with Decadence&quot;, to the point of having been known in Russian white émigré circles as the &quot;Ur-decadent&quot; painter, but John Robert Reed&#x27;s monograph &quot;Decadent Style&quot; (1985) argues that he depicted decadent themes without embracing the Decadent form of art. Rops achieved the reputation of a pornographer early on in his career, with his work featured prominently and his name advertised on the frontispiece of the British Victorian era pornography collector Henry Spencer Ashbee&#x27;s &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; (1877). Some of his critics dismiss him as a novel, 19th-century illustrator/pornographer, but others look beyond the erotica and write of him respectfully and favorably. He was regarded as the greatest Belgian artist of his time by Baudelaire (an influential art critic as well as a poet). Jean-Luc Daval spoke of &quot;the amazing upsurge of Symbolism that in the wake of Félicien Rops and under the influence of Gustave Moreau, characterized Belgian painting at the turn of the century.&quot; According to Edith Hoffmann, the &quot;erotic or frankly pornographic&quot; nature of much of Rops&#x27;s work &quot;is at least partly due to the attraction these subjects had for a provincial artist who never forgot his first impressions of Paris&quot;. In contrast to Hoffmann&#x27;s &quot;provincial artist&quot;, Octave Mirbeau wrote &quot;Painter, man of letters, philosopher, scholar, Rops was all of that.&quot;

Félicien Rops was a prolific and versatile artist. In addition to works of fine art depicting genre subjects, still-life, landscapes, decadent nightlife, eroticism, and iconic symbolist works like &quot;Pornocrates&quot;, he produced hundreds of comics, caricatures, book illustrations, and even an occasional advertisement. His style could sway from realism, to symbolism, and at times even touch on romanticism and impressionism. His images can be pastoral (e.g. &quot;The Rocks of the Grands Malades&quot;) or urban (e.g. &quot;Sailors Den&quot;); social and political critiques both sympathetic (e.g. &quot;Strike, The Charcoal&quot;) and caustic (e.g. &quot;Order Reigns in Warsaw&quot;); documentary (e.g. &quot;Head of Zealander&quot;) or fantasy (e.g. &quot;The Librarian&quot;); and range from poetic and metaphoric (e.g. &quot;The Lyre&quot;) to stark realism (e.g. &quot;Absinthe Drinker&quot;). Three etchings depicting animals illustrate a wide display of approaches in styles, techniques, and underlying connotations (see gallery II). &quot;Japanese Salamander and Beetle&quot; is loose in technique and a simple, decorative nature study, one of a few pastiches Rops made of Japanese woodblock printing that were popular and influential among European artists in the late 19th century. &quot;The Cat&quot;, executed in an illustrative, near academic style, presents a pleasant likeness of a cat, yet embroidered on the chair is the phrase &quot;Amica Non Serva&quot; [Friend Not Servant], endowing this unassuming image with a declaration of sovereignty not immediately apparent to the casual viewer. &quot;Separated or Simian Spring&quot; uses an abrupt and serrated hatching technique to convey primitive, psycho-sexual undertones that anticipates expressionism in the early 20th century.

French art critic and historian Jean Cassou posited three distinct periods in Rops&#x27;s artistic life: romantic 1855–1860; symbolist 1860–1870; realist 1871–1898. While these dates are not supported by others, and are contrary to even the most cursory examination of the work [e.g., symbolist works such as &quot;Pornocrates&quot; (1878); &quot;Les Sataniques&quot; (1882); &quot;The Lyre&quot; frontispiece for &quot;Poésies&quot; by Mallarmé (1895); and &quot;Parallelism&quot;, the frontispiece for &quot;Chair&quot; [&quot;Flesh&quot;] by Verlaine (1896) were produced in Cassou&#x27;s posited &quot;realist 1871–1898&quot; period], Cassou&#x27;s association of Rops with realism is valid and important in understanding his work. Whether drawing genre subjects or decadent Parisian nightlife, Rops produced realist images throughout his artistic life and they constitute a significant part of his oeuvre. This aspect of his work is often marginalized or ignored by authors who are preoccupied with his erotic and satanic images (enthusiastically or negatively).

Working in a long and rich tradition of Franco-Flemish realist-genre painting (e.g., the Le Nain Brothers, Adriaen Brouwer) but also showing an awareness and influence of contemporaries like Honoré Daumier, Jean-François Millet, and Gustave Courbet, Rops was attracted to genre subjects throughout his life. Although represented in any number of media, they most often appear in his drawings and etchings. The rural and working people of Wallonia were frequent subjects, typically treated in a simple and sympathetic manner, as in &quot;The Kitchen of the Artists&#x27; Inn, in Anseremme&quot;. The elderly appear again and again in works such as &quot;Old Kate&quot;. Rops also often drew and etched people he encountered in his travels who were dressed in ethnic and regional clothing and costumes, often in a rather documentary style. Two examples include &quot;A Shaker Pianist&quot; and &quot;Head of Zealander&quot;: others are &quot;La Dalécarlienne&quot; (1874), &quot;Le Moujick&quot; (1874), and &quot;In the Pusta&quot; (1879). Rops once wrote he had &quot;the desire to depict the scenes and characters of the 19th century that I find so fascinating and curious&quot; and pieces like &quot;Sailors Den&quot;, &quot;Cherub&#x27;s Song&quot;, and &quot;The Absinthe Drinker&quot; can be viewed as works of realism just as they can be seen as works of the decadent movement.

Rops once wrote: &quot;The love of brutal pleasures, the pre-occupation with money, and mean interests have glued onto the faces of most of our contemporaries, a sinister mask in which the perverse instinct mentioned by Edgar Allan Poe can be read in capital letters: all of this seems to me sufficiently amusing and characteristic that well-meaning artists should attempt to render the look of their time&quot;.

He was credited by Joris-Karl Huysmans with reclaiming lust for the visual arts and placing it centre-stage. Huysmans noted the religious motivation of Rops&#x27;s art, &quot;not ... obscene and practical ... but ... Catholic, flaming and terrible&quot;. Charles Brison observed that &quot;Rops never shed his Catholic sense of sin and the accompanying need for forgiveness&quot;. To Reed, &quot;[Rops&#x27;s] satanism was a protest, suggesting a craving not unlike Huysmans&#x27;s for the fierce commitments of the Middle Ages&quot;. Stanisław Przybyszewski, who drew from Rops&#x27;s outlook on women along with his follower, the painter Wojciech Weiss, traced Rops&#x27;s depictions of lust to the witchhunters Jean Bodin and Pierre de Lancre. Rops&#x27;s prostitution-themed artwork, in particular &quot;The Human Parody&quot; (1878–1881), fits into an iconographic tradition reaching as far back as the fifteenth century.

Huysmans highlighted Rops&#x27;s use of woman as a symbol for moralistic social critique – a dehumanising device that Reed argues has the opposite effect to the Decadent concern with the decorative. Rops associated woman with death, materialism and a pursuit of pleasure that represented &quot;a perversion of the higher craving for an impossible ideal&quot;. His portrayal of female figures has been placed in the context of turn-of-the-century concerns with female vampirism. &quot;Pornocrates&quot; mockingly proposes a &quot;triumph of lechery over romantic love&quot; as the outcome of the contemporary women&#x27;s movement.

According to H. R. Blakeley, &quot;scholarship about Rops disproportionately fixates on the erotic aspects of his art, reductively classifying him as perversely misogynistic instead of investigating the complexities of his relationships with and attitudes about women.&quot;

=== Painting and drawing ===
Rops&#x27;s oil paintings are varied in subject and style. They include still life paintings, street scenes such as &quot;Entrance to the Ball&quot;, the Symbolist &quot;Death at the Ball&quot;, and many landscapes. He painted landscapes throughout his career, often small canvases done in En plein air. Examples like &quot;The Rocks of the Grands Malades&quot; and &quot;Snow in Thozée&quot; were painted in the vicinity of his hometown Namur, in Wallonia (Belgium). The influences of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet, and the Barbizon School can be detected in many of his landscapes. Living in Paris and exhibiting with Les XX, Rops had ample opportunity to meet artists and absorb the work of the schools and movements of the day, and elements of impressionism are evident in &quot;The Beach in Heist&quot;, painted on the Belgian coast.

A small series of variations on a theme, &quot;The Lady with the Puppet&quot; includes four drawings with mixed media (watercolor, color pencil, pastel etc.) that were executed between 1873 and 1890. These symbolist works each show a woman, a &quot;simple tart&quot;, playing with a puppet (an allegory of man). In one, the woman unassumingly holds a blood-smeared trailing point at her side, with which she has slit the belly of the puppet open, and amusingly holds the puppet high as gold coins drain from his limp body.

About 1878–1881 Rops produced a large series of over 100 pieces he called &quot;Cent légers croquis pour réjouir les honnêtes gens&quot; (&quot;A hundred lighthearted sketches without pretension to delight honest people&quot;) for a Parisian bibliophile, Jules Noilly. These were made in a variety of mixed media, mostly works on paper, including drawing, color pencil, watercolor, gouache, and pastel. Examples from the series include &quot;The Human Parody&quot;, &quot;The Librarian&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Amour Mouché, Venus and Cupid-Love blowing his nose&quot;, and &quot;Cherub&#x27;s Song&quot;.

=== Prints and book illustrations ===
&quot;Rops was a printmaker of brilliant technique and original content whose handling of dry point (etching directly on the plate) marks him as one of the masters of the medium.&quot; Although Rops worked in a wide range of media, his primary means of expression was printmaking. He worked with lithography, wood engraving, etching, aquatint, mezzotint, soft-ground etching, burin engravings, heliogravure and other techniques producing hundreds of prints in his life. His prints are remarkably diverse and span the full spectrum of the styles and subject matter that he explored throughout his life. He begin shifting from lithography to intaglio in the 1860s when he studied etching with Félix Bracquemond and Jules Ferdinand Jacquemart in Paris. Félix Bracquemond was one of the central figures in reviving an interest in etching among artists of the time, encouraging and coaching artists such as Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Camille Pissarro, and others to explore the neglected art form. By the end of the decade Rops had all but abandoned lithography. Rops founded the International Society of Etchers about 1869 or 1870. Although the society received praises from artists and royalty alike, financially he struggled to keep it going for more than two to three years.

Fascinated by the processes, he was constantly experimenting with printmaking techniques throughout his career. Starting around the early 1870s, Rops begin using soft-ground etching, a technique practiced by few artists of his day, often combining it with mezzotint, aquatint, dry point, and other techniques, sometimes adding hand-coloring to the plates. He photo-mechanically (heliogravure) transferred many of his original drawings to intaglio plates, and often developed the images further in that medium with any number of techniques such as dry point, aquatint, soft-ground etching, etc. However, traditional soft-ground methods did not work well for his purposes, so in collaboration with his friend and colleague Armand Rassenfosse, they invented a process they called &quot;Ropsenfosse&quot;. Ropsenfosse used several different soft-ground formulas and was likely the first soft-ground method used to produce color prints with two or more plates.

His etchings were popular and many of the progressive writers, poets, and publishers of late 19th-century literature sought out his talents for their publications. His prints were widely distributed in the books he illustrated and influenced many younger artists, including several Symbolists and Expressionist such as Max Beckmann, Lovis Corinth, James Ensor, Alfred Kubin, Fernand Khnopff, Max Klinger, Edvard Munch and others. &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; largely was inspired by a figure by Rops that impressed director Josef von Sternberg.

=== &quot;Les Sataniques&quot; and &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; ===
As early as 1896, when a special tribute edition of the literary journal La Plume (No. 172, 15 June) was published honoring Rops, the illustrations he produced for d&#x27;Aurevilly&#x27;s &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; as well as an earlier series, &quot;Les Sataniques&quot; were often singled out and &quot;placed at the top of the ropsian pantheon&quot; and considered the &quot;paradigm of the Ropsian work&quot;. Subsequent critics, historians, as well as his admirers among the general public have consistently regarded these prints as among the best examples of his illustrative oeuvre. Art historian Robert L. Delevoy wrote &quot;His etchings for &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; by Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly are regarded as some of the best illustrative work ever done.&quot;

Les Sataniques (&quot;The Satanic&quot;) was a series of his own initiative, independent of his book illustrations and literary works. Dating from about 1882, there are a number of closely related drawings, watercolors, sketches, and other mixed media pieces, as well as prints in various states of development. He had hoped to do a large series and eventually publish them in the form of a book, but this never came to fruition. Ultimately a set of five heliogravures (based on five original drawings) were published, including: &quot;Satan semant l&#x27;ivraie&quot; (&quot;Satan Sowing Tare&quot;), &quot;L&#x27;enlèvement&quot; (&quot;The Abduction&quot;), &quot;Le Calvaire&quot; (&quot;The Calvary&quot;), &quot;L&#x27;idole&quot; (&quot;The Idol&quot;), and &quot;Le Sacrifice&quot; (&quot;The Sacrifice&quot;). The frontispiece of the cycle, &quot;Satan Sowing Tare&quot;, which appeared in several versions, was based on the Biblical &quot;Parable of the Tares&quot; which appears in Matthew 13:24-13:30. This series ranks among the more familiar and discussed images of his work. There is nothing in the dozens of references below to suggest that Rops was actively involved or a believer in Satanism, and his use of this subject was only symbolic or metaphoric.

Les Diaboliques (&quot;The She-Devils&quot;) is a collection of six short stories by Jules Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly that was first published in 1874. Each story is centered around a bored, bourgeois woman, usually involved in a crime of violent depravity or act of revenge. The book was an instant success and quickly sold out. The uproar caught the attention of the Public Prosecutor, the book was banned, the author and publisher were charged with insulting public morality, and set to be put on trial. However, with the aid of Léon Gambetta, a sympathetic statesman, a trial was avoided. Rops did not illustrate the first edition. Laws granting the freedom of the press in France were passed on 29 July 1881 and a second edition of the book was planned by the publisher, Alphonse Lemerre, who thought Rops was ideally suited to illustrate the new edition. Rops provided Lemerre with designs for the illustrations in the form of drawings, but the actual production of the etchings is believed to have been delegated to others. The first set of etchings is referred to as the &quot;Lemerre format&quot;, or small boards [plates], and likely date from 1882 when the second edition of the book was published. However Delaporte, in his thesis, discuses a myriad of inconsistency involving the production and dates of the small etchings and suggest they could have appeared ca. 1882–1886.

Rops wrote in a letter to Jean-François Taelemans (8 April 1886) that he was unsatisfied and the &quot;small boards do not say anything&quot;. He began a second set based on the original drawings using a heliogravure technique, which he then reworked by hand with aquatint, soft-ground varnish, drypoint, etc. The heliogravure prints gave Rops a greater ability to exhibit subtleties and nuances of light and shadow in the dark, nocturnal images. Apparently &quot;La Vengeance d&#x27;une Femme&quot; (&quot;The Vengeance of a Woman&quot;) was not reproduced in the heliogravure set. The second, heliogravure set, is referred to as the large boards. Like the small boards, the history of the production and dates of the large boards involve many inconsistencies, contradictions, and other issues, but date from ca.1887-1893. The &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; illustrations includes nine prints: the frontispiece &quot;Le Sphinx&quot; (T&quot;he Sphinx&quot;); a prescript &quot;La Prostitution et la folie dominant le monde&quot; (&quot;Prostitution and Madness Rule the World&quot;); an illustration for each chapter, &quot;Le Rideau Cramoisi&quot; (&quot;The Crimson Curtain&quot;); &quot;Le plus bel amour de Don Juan&quot; (&quot;The Greatest Love of Don Juan&quot;); &quot;Le bonheur le dans le crime&quot; (&quot;Happiness in Crime&quot;); &quot;À un dîner d&#x27;athées&quot; (&quot;At a Dinner of Atheists&quot;); &quot;Le Dessous de Cartes d&#x27;une Partie de Whist&quot; (&quot;Beneath the Cards in a Game of Whist&quot;); &quot;La Vengeance d&#x27;une Femme&quot; (&quot;The Vengeance of a Woman&quot;); and a postscript &quot;La Femme et la folie dominant le monde&quot; (&quot;Woman &amp; Madness Rule the World&quot;).

The print of &quot;The Greatest Love of Don Juan&quot; bears a striking similarity to Edvard Munch&#x27;s famous painting &quot;Puberty&quot; painted in 1894. As early as 1894, with the first publication ever devoted to Munch, comparisons have been made. Munch denied having been influenced by Rops&#x27;s etching, and said his painting was a copy of another painting he had made in the mid-1880s and &quot;that this earlier version had been lost in a studio fire.&quot; Nonetheless, art critics and historians have consistently noted the similarities.

=== Cartoons and caricatures ===
Félicien Rops was a pioneer and considered by many as the starting point for Belgian Comics. He was the first Belgian cartoonist to produce text comics, a comic strip based on a recurring character, satirical, and erotic comics. Rops began publishing comics in student magazines including &quot;Le Crocodile&quot; and &quot;Le Diable au Salon&quot; while still in school in the 1850s. He sometimes published using pseudonyms, including &quot;Spor&quot;, &quot;Risette&quot;, &quot;Graffin&quot;, &quot;Cham-Loth&quot;, and &quot;Croque-tout&quot;. With friends he co-founded a weekly artistic and literary satirical review &quot;The Uylenspiegel&quot; in 1856, which he contributed to regularly until its demise 1862. Examples of the early use of text comics and reoccurring characters include &quot;Les époux Van-Blague&quot;, the comedic experiences of a couple published in &quot;Le Crocodile&quot; (e.g. issue #40, 20 November 1853) and a series of thematically unified, but otherwise unrelated humorous episodes at the Antwerp Zoo &quot;Promenade au Jardin Zoologique&quot;. One cartoon in particular, &#x27;La Médaille de Waterloo&#x27; (1858), depicting a decrepit, peg legged likeness of Napoléon Bonaparte on a medal, guarded by his devotee&#x27;s from a hoard of skeletons rising from the dead, (in criticism of those who held Napoléon in honor with seemingly no regard for the havoc and loss of life that he had brought to Europe) caused an outrage in France and Belgium. However, ultimately this only served to further Rops notoriety. Rops published significantly fewer comics as his career as an illustrator of books progressed but, he produced occasional comics, caricatures, even advertisements, throughout his life.

<text>In grammar, the instrumental case (abbreviated or ) is a grammatical case used to indicate that a noun is the &quot;instrument&quot; or means by or with which the subject achieves or accomplishes an action. The noun may be either a physical object or an abstract concept.

==General discussion==
The instrumental case appears in this Russian sentence:
Here, the inflection of the noun indicates its instrumental role: the nominative &quot;перо&quot; changes its ending to become &quot;пером&quot;.

Modern English expresses the instrumental meaning by use of adverbial phrases that begin with the words &quot;with&quot;, &quot;by&quot;, or &quot;using&quot;, followed by the noun indicating the &quot;instrument&quot;:

:&quot;I wrote the note with a pen.&quot;
:&quot;I wrote the note (by) using a pen.&quot;

Technical descriptions often use the phrase &quot;by means of&quot;, which is similar to &quot;by use of&quot;, as in:

:&quot;I wrote the note by means of a pen.&quot;
:&quot;I wrote the note by use of a pen.&quot;

This can be replaced by &quot;via&quot;, which is a Latin ablative of the nominative (viā) &quot;via&quot;, meaning road, route, or way. In the ablative it means &quot;by way of&quot;.

The instrumental case appears in Old English, Old Saxon, Georgian, Armenian, Basque, Sanskrit, and the Balto-Slavic languages. An instrumental/comitative case is arguably present in Turkish as well as in Tamil. Also, Uralic languages reuse the adessive case where available, locative case if not, to mark the same category, or comitative case (Estonian). For example, the Finnish &quot;kirjoitan kynällä&quot; does not mean &quot;I write on a pen&quot;, but &quot;I write using a pen&quot;, even if the adessive &quot;-llä&quot; is used. In Ob-Ugric languages, the same category may also mark agents with verbs that use an ergative alignment, for instance, &quot;I give you, using a pen&quot;.

The instrumental case is notably used in Russian, where the case is called &quot;творительный падеж (tvoritel&#x27;nyj padež)&quot; though similar usages also can be found in other Balto-Slavic languages. In most declension paradigms, the instrumental case in Russian can generally be distinguished by the -ом (&quot;-om&quot;) suffix for most masculine and neuter nouns, the -ою/-oй (&quot;-oju&quot;/&quot;-oj&quot;) suffix for most feminine nouns and -ами (&quot;-ami&quot;) for any of the three genders in the plural.

Just as in English the preposition &quot;with&quot; can express instrumental (&quot;using, by means of&quot;), comitative (&quot;in the company of&quot;), and a number of other semantic relations, the instrumental case in Russian is not limited to its instrumental thematic role. It is also used to denote:

* the agent in a passive voice construction. E.g.: &quot;Книга написана Марком Твеном&quot; (&quot;The book was written by Mark Twain&quot;). Here, &quot;Марком Твеном&quot; (&quot;by Mark Twain&quot;) is &quot;Марк Твен&quot; (&quot;Mark Twain&quot;) in the instrumental case.
* a predicate with infinitive, future tense, imperative, conditional and gerund of the verbs &quot;быть&quot; and &quot;являться&quot; (both meaning &#x27;to be&#x27;) (for example, &quot;я хочу быть врачом&quot;, &quot;не будь трусом&quot; translate as &quot;I want to be a doctor&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t be a coward&quot;, with the nouns in the instrumental case).
* a predicate with a number of other verbs, denoting state, appearance, manner, consideration, etc.
* parts of the day, seasons of the year, and some other temporal relations. For example, the sentence &quot;я работаю утром&quot; (ja rabotaju utrom) means &quot;I work in the morning&quot;. The word утро (utro, &quot;morning&quot;) in its instrumental case denotes the time in which the action (in the case of this example, &quot;working&quot;) takes place (&quot;in the morning&quot;).
* similarity. For example, the phrases &quot;выть волком,&quot; &quot;умереть героем,&quot; &quot;лететь стрелой&quot; (to howl like a wolf, to die like a hero, to fly like an arrow) use nouns in the instrumental case.
* location, when used with prepositions &quot;behind&quot;, &quot;in front of&quot;, &quot;under&quot;, &quot;above&quot;, &quot;next to&quot;, and &quot;between&quot;

The Russian instrumental case is also used with verbs of use and control (to own, to manage, to abuse, to rule, to possess, etc.), attitude (to be proud of, to threaten (with), to value, to be interested (in), to admire, to be obsessed (with), etc.), reciprocal action (to share, to exchange), and some other verbs.

Though the instrumental case does not exist in many languages, some languages use other cases to denote the means, or instrument, of an action. In Classical Greek, for example, the dative case is used as the instrumental case. This can be seen in the sentence &quot;,&quot; or &quot;..me ktenei dolôi&quot; (Book IX, line 407 of the Odyssey), which means &quot;he kills me with a bait&quot;. Here, &quot;,&quot; the dative of &quot;δόλος&quot; (&quot;dolos&quot; – a bait) is used as the instrumental case (the means or instrument here is, obviously, the bait). In Latin the instrumental case has merged with the ablative, thus the ablative case has the same functions. For example, &quot;ipso facto&quot; can be translated as &quot;by the fact itself&quot;, while &quot;oculīs vidēre&quot; means &quot;to see with one&#x27;s eyes&quot;.

In Modern English, the word &quot;why&quot; is one instance of an etymologically instrumental declension. Though not commonly known to be of pronominal origin, it was, in fact, inherited from Old English &quot;hwȳ&quot;, which was the declension of &quot;hwæt&quot; (now &quot;what&quot;) in the Old English instrumental casea grammatical feature rare even in Old English. The modern instrumental case (as present in &quot;why&quot;) does not bear the meaning of instrument, but of purpose, cause, or reason: rather, the closely related form &quot;how&quot; is used to express instrument, way, or means. In phrases such as &quot;The more, the merrier&quot;, the word &quot;the&quot; derives from the instrumental case of the demonstrative pronoun related to the modern English word &quot;that&quot;.

==Indo-European languages==
Proto-Indo-European has been reconstructed as having eight cases, one of which was the instrumental.

===Sanskrit===
The instrumental case in Classical Sanskrit can have several meanings:
* It can indicate the instrument (of an action):

* It can be used to indicate someone or something accompanying an action. In this case, the sense of &quot;company&quot; is indicated by postpositions like सह &quot;saha&quot; (&quot;with&quot;) (may be optionally omitted):

* It can indicate the agent of a passive verb:

* It can indicate the cause, reason or circumstance of an action. In this case, it can be translated as &quot;because of&quot;, &quot;out of&quot;, etc.:

* It is used with the preposition विना &quot;vinā&quot; (&quot;without&quot;):

* It can also be used with the particles अलम् &quot;alam&quot; and कृतम् &quot;kṛtam&quot;, both meaning &quot;enough&quot;.
===Assamese===
In Standard Assamese (এ)ৰে &quot;(e)re&quot; indicates the instrumental case. (এ)দি &quot;(e)di&quot; does the job in some dialects.

===Ancient Greek===
The functions of the Proto-Indo-European instrumental case were taken over by the dative, so that the Greek dative has functions belonging to the Proto-Indo-European dative, instrumental, and locative. This is the case with the bare dative, and the dative with the preposition &quot;sýn&quot; &quot;with&quot;. It is possible, however, that Mycenean Greek had the instrumental case, which was later replaced by dative in all the Greek dialects.

===Germanic===
Common Germanic inherited the Indo-European instrumental case, but in nouns, the case was almost entirely lost in Gothic, Old Norse and Old Frisian, which indicated the instrumental case with the dative inflection in all but a few relic forms. Early Old High German and Old Saxon nouns do exhibit an instrumental case, for example Old High German &quot;wortu&quot; &#x27;word&#x27; and Old Saxon &quot;hoƀu&quot; &#x27;court&#x27;, where the -&quot;u&quot; ending derives from a Proto-Indo-European instrumental inflection *-&quot;ō&quot;. In adjectives, no instrumental plural inflection can be reconstructed for Common Germanic, but the early West Germanic dialects did retain a distinctive instrumental singular strong adjective ending. Similarly, in demonstrative and interrogative pronouns, there is no evidence for distinctive instrumental plural inflections, but the West Germanic dialects and, less often, Old Norse and Gothic, retained distinctive instrumental singular forms.

====Old English====
The instrumental case is found in certain usages in Old English. It has left a legacy in Modern English, in the words &quot;why&quot; and &quot;thus&quot;: &#x27;why&#x27; is from hwy, the instrumental case of &#x27;hwa / hwæt&#x27; (who / what) and &#x27;thus&#x27; apparently from þys, the instrumental case of &#x27;þes / þis&#x27; (this).

Adjectives and the demonstrative and interrogative pronouns all have instrumental forms. Adverbs are commonly formed in Old English by adding &quot;-e&quot; to the adjective, which is the adjective&#x27;s instrumental case.

In Old English, the instrumental case denotes means or manner, in such phrases as &quot;oþre naman Iulius&quot; (&#x27;by other name called Julius&#x27;) or expressions of time: &quot;þy ilcan dæge&quot;; &#x27;on the same day&#x27;. (In these examples, the whole expression is in the instrumental case, but only the &quot;oþre&quot; or &quot;þy&quot; is distinctive in form from the dative.)

====Development into Middle High German====
In nouns, the Old German instrumental was replaced with the dative in Middle High German, comparable with English and Ancient Greek, with a construction of &quot;mit&quot; (with) + dative clause (in English, the objective case is used). For example:

&quot;Hans schrieb mit einem Stifte*.&quot;
(John [nominative] wrote with a [dative] pencil [dative].)

&quot;*the German dative -e is not used in most common conversation; it is only used here for a better demonstration.&quot;

*ein = a, nominative case masculine/neuter → einem = a, dative case masculine/neuter
*(der) Stift = (the) pencil, masculine, nominative
*(dem) Stifte = (the) pencil, masculine, dative

===Czech===
Just as above, the object with which the action is done or completed is declined. For example:
* &quot;Píšu perem&quot;.
** psát = to write; píšu = I write
** pero = a pen → per&quot;em&quot; = &quot;with&quot; a pen
* &quot;Jedu do školy autobusem&quot;.
** jet = to go via transport (× jít = to go on foot); jedu = I go (using any kind of vehicle)
** škola = school, do školy = to school (dative)
** autobus = a bus → autobus&quot;em&quot; = &quot;by&quot; bus

===Armenian===
The instrumental in Armenian is denoted by the -ով (-ov) suffix to say that an action is done by, with or through an agent.
* մատիտ (&quot;matit&quot;, pencil) → մատիտ&quot;ով&quot; (&quot;matitov&quot;, with/by a pencil)
** մատիտով գրիր (&quot;matitov grir&quot;) Write with a pencil.

While the instrumental case is the form most commonly used for this purpose, when coupled with the passive voice in Armenian the instrumental case can be replaced with the ablative case.

===Serbo-Croatian===

Instrumental in the Serbo-Croatian language group is usually used to denote a noun with which the action is done, e.g. &quot;Idem &quot;autom&quot;&quot; - &quot;I&#x27;m going by means of a car&quot;, &quot;Jedem &quot;vilicom/viljuškom&quot;&quot; - &quot;I eat with a fork&quot;, &quot;Prenosi se &quot;zrakom/vazduhom&quot;&quot; - &quot;It&#x27;s transferred through air&quot;, &quot;Prožeta je &quot;bijesom&quot;&quot; - &quot;She&#x27;s consumed by anger&quot;. The instrumental preposition &quot;s(a)&quot;, meaning &quot;with&quot;, is supposed to be dropped in this usage, but it is often kept in casual speech when talking about objects in use, such as a pen, a hammer, etc.

Instrumental can also denote company, in which case &quot;s(a)&quot; is mandatory, e.g. &quot;Pričali smo &quot;sa svima&quot;&quot; - &quot;We talked with everyone&quot;, &quot;Došao je &quot;s roditeljima&quot;&quot; - &quot;He came with his parents&quot;, &quot;Šetala se &quot;sa psom&quot;&quot; - &quot;She was taking a walk with her dog&quot;. Dropping &quot;s(a)&quot; in this case would either make the sentences incorrect, or change their meaning entirely because dative, locative and instrumental share the same form in the plural, so the examples &quot;Pričali smo &quot;svima&quot;&quot; i &quot;Došao je &quot;roditeljima&quot;&quot; would come to mean &quot;We told everyone&quot; and &quot;He came to his parents&quot;.

Instrumental is also used with certain spatial prepositions like &quot;među&quot; (between), &quot;nad&quot; (above), &quot;pod&quot; (underneath), &quot;pred&quot; (in front of) and &quot;za&quot; (after). Note the difference between these prepositions and similar ones used for genitive with an -i suffix: &quot;između&quot;, &quot;iznad&quot;, &quot;ispod&quot;, &quot;ispred&quot; and &quot;iza&quot;.

Instrumental is used without proposition to denote travelling through an area: &quot;Putujem &quot;zemljom&quot;&quot; - &quot;I&#x27;m travelling the country&quot;, &quot;Hodam &quot;plažom&quot;&quot; - &quot;I&#x27;m walking along a beach&quot;, etc.

It can also be used to show how long or when in a larger scope of time something happened: &quot;Nema ih &quot;godinama&quot;&quot; - &quot;They haven&#x27;t come in years&quot;, &quot;&quot;S vremenom&quot; će proći&quot; - &quot;It will pass in time&quot;, &quot;Jednom &quot;tjednom&quot;&quot; - &quot;Once a week&quot;, etc.

===Latvian===
The instrumental case in Latvian declension (one of the three Baltic languages, alongside Lithuanian and Old Prussian) can have several meanings:
* It can indicate the instrument (of an action):
:&quot;He writes &quot;with a pen&quot;&quot;.
* It can be used to indicate someone or something accompanying an action. In this case, :
:&quot;She sang with a girl&quot;.

==Uralic==
===Hungarian===
The instrumental case is present in the Hungarian language, where it serves several purposes. The main purpose is the same as the above, i.e. the means with which an action occurs. It has a role in the &quot;-(t)at-&quot; causative form of verbs, that is, the form of a verb that shows the subject caused someone else to action the verb. In this sense, the instrumental case is used to mark the person that was caused to execute the action expressed by the verb. It is also used to quantify or qualify words such as &#x27;better&#x27; or &#x27;ago&#x27;, such as &quot;sokkal jobban&quot; &#x27;much better&#x27; (literally &#x27;with-much better&#x27;); &quot;hét évvel ezelőtt&quot; &#x27;seven years ago&#x27; (literally &#x27;seven with-years before this&#x27;).

In Hungarian the instrumental and comitative case look the same, see Instrumental-comitative case.

See the links section below for a more detailed article.

===Finnish===
Finnish has a historic, marginal instructive case (&quot;-n&quot;), but in practice the adessive case (&quot;-lla/-llä&quot;) is used instead outside lexicalised fixed expressions, even though the adessive literally means &#x27;on top&#x27;, e.g. &quot;vasaralla&quot; &#x27;using a hammer&#x27; (instrumental meaning) or &#x27;on a hammer&#x27; (locative meaning). (&quot;Vasaroin&quot; &#x27;using hammers&#x27; is plausible and understandable, but not common in use.)

==Uto-Aztecan==
===Nahuatl===
Nahuatl uses the suffix &quot;-tica&quot; to indicate the instrumental case.
For example, in the sentence &quot;ātlān ācaltica in huāllahqueh&quot; &#x27;they came on the water by boat&#x27;, &quot;ācalli&quot; means &#x27;boat&#x27; and &quot;ācaltica&quot; means &#x27;by (use of a) boat&#x27;.

==Turkic==

===Turkish===
Turkish uses the conjunction &quot;ile&quot; (&quot;with&quot;), and its suffixed form &quot;-(y)lA&quot; (realised as &quot;-(y)la&quot; or &quot;-(y)le&quot;, depending on the dominant vowel of the noun—see vowel harmony) to indicate the instrumental case. For example, in the sentence &quot;Arabayla geldi&quot; &#x27;he came by (the use of a) car&#x27;, &quot;araba&quot; means &#x27;car&#x27; and &quot;arabayla&quot; means &#x27;by (the use of a) car, with a car&#x27;.

The original Proto-Turkic instrumental case suffix was &quot;-n&quot;, which is less productive today but is preserved in common words like &quot;yazın&quot; (&quot;during the summer&quot;), &quot;kışın&quot; (&quot;during the winter&quot;), &quot;öğlen&quot; (&quot;at noon&quot;), and &quot;yayan&quot; (&quot;by foot&quot;, &quot;on foot&quot;). It became less productive in most Oghuz Turkic languages. The conjunction &quot;ile&quot; (&quot;with&quot;) in Turkish has semantically expanded to fill the gap (&quot;kürek ile&quot; or &quot;kürekle&quot;, meaning &quot;with the shovel&quot; &gt; &quot;using the shovel&quot;), being used as an instrumental marker, and the suffix &quot;-(y)lA&quot; (&quot;-le&quot;, &quot;-la&quot;, &quot;-yle&quot;, &quot;-yla&quot;) is a form of &quot;ile&quot; which has been grammaticalized into an agglutinative suffix as a result of quick speech, becoming an enclitic.

==Japanese==
In Japanese, the post-positional particle で &quot;de&quot; indicates the instrumental case.

==Northeast Caucasian==
===Vainakh===
The instrumental in the Vainakh languages of the North Caucasus, comprising Chechen and Ingush, is denoted by the -ца / -аца / -ица (-tsa / -atsa / -itsa) suffix to describe an action which is done with an object:
The nominative &quot;Baham&quot; changes its ending to become &quot;Bahamitsa&quot;:
*Бахьам = pen → Бахьам&quot;ица&quot; = &quot;with&quot; a pen
**Бахьамица йазздир (&quot;bahamitsa yazzdir&quot;) Wrote with a pen.

<text>The flowerpeckers are a family, Dicaeidae, of passerine birds. The family comprises two genera, &quot;Dicaeum&quot; and &quot;Prionochilus&quot;, with 50 species in total. The family has sometimes been included in an enlarged sunbird family Nectariniidae. The berrypeckers of the family Melanocharitidae and the painted berrypeckers, Paramythiidae, were once lumped into this family as well. The family is distributed through tropical southern Asia and Australasia from India east to the Philippines and south to Australia. The family has a wide range occupying a wide range of environments from sea level to montane habitats. Some species, such as the mistletoebird of Australia, are recorded as being highly nomadic over parts of their range.

There is little variation in structure between species in the family although many have distinctive and colourful plumage. Flowerpeckers are stout birds, with short necks and legs. These are small birds ranging from the 10-cm, 5.7-gram pygmy flowerpecker to the 18-cm, 12-gram mottled flowerpecker. Flowerpeckers have short tails, short thick curved bills and tubular tongues. The latter features reflect the importance of nectar in the diet of many species. They also have digestive systems that have evolved to deal efficiently with mistletoe berries. They are often dull in colour, although in several species the males have brightly patterned crimson or glossy-black plumage. 

Nectar forms part of the diet, although they also take berries, spiders and insects. Mistletoes of 21 species in 12 genera have been found to be part of the diet of flowerpeckers, and it is thought that all species have adaptations to eat these berries and dispose of them quickly. Flowerpeckers may occur in mixed-species feeding flocks with sunbirds and white-eyes, as well as other species of flowerpecker.

The breeding biology of the flowerpeckers has been little studied. In the species where data has been collected they apparently form monogamous pairs for breeding, but the division of labour varies; in scarlet-breasted flowerpeckers both parents participate in all aspects of nest building, incubation and chick rearing, but in the mistletoebird the female undertakes the first two tasks alone. Flowerpeckers lay 1–4 eggs, typically in a purse-like nest of plant fibres, suspended from a small tree or shrub. Recorded incubation times are scarce, but range from 10–12 days, with fledging occurring after 15 days.

The two genera in the family are separated on the basis of the length of the outermost primary which is elongated in &quot;Prionochilus&quot; and reduced in most &quot;Dicaeum&quot; species although &quot;D. melanozanthum&quot; is an exception with an elongated outer primary. Molecular phylogeny studies, however, suggest that some &quot;Dicaeum&quot; are closer to species traditionally in &quot;Prionochilus&quot; and that generic placements across the family may need to be revised.

The majority of flowerpeckers are resilient in their habits and are not threatened by human activities. Five species are considered to be near threatened by the IUCN, two are listed as vulnerable and one, the Cebu flowerpecker, is listed as critically endangered. The status of the enigmatic spectacled flowerpecker is unknown. Habitat loss is the cause of the declines of these species.

<text>Joy Nozomi Kogawa (born June 6, 1935) is a Canadian poet and novelist of Japanese descent.

== Life ==

Kogawa was born Joy Nozomi Nakayama on June 6, 1935, in Vancouver, British Columbia, to first-generation Japanese Canadians Lois Yao Nakayama and Gordon Goichi Nakayama. She grew up in a predominantly white, middle-class community.

During World War II, the Japanese military attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and twelve weeks later Kogawa was sent with her family to the internment camp for Japanese Canadians at Slocan during World War II. After the war she resettled with her family in Coaldale, Alberta, where she completed high school. In 1954 she attended the University of Alberta, and in 1956, the Anglican Women&#x27;s Training College and The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. She moved back to Vancouver in 1956 and married David Kogawa there in 1957, with whom she had two children: Gordon and Deirdre. The couple divorced in 1968, and the same year Kogawa attended the University of Saskatchewan. She moved to Toronto in 1979 and has lived there since.

Kogawa&#x27;s published first as a poet, beginning in 1968 with &quot;The Splintered Moon&quot;. She began to work as a staff writer for the Office of the Prime Minister in Ottawa in 1974. In 1981 she published her first prose work: &quot;Obasan&quot;, a semi-autobiographical novel that has become her best-known work. &quot;Books in Canada&quot; awarded the book its First Novel Award for it in 1981, and in 1982 Kogawa won the Book of the Year Award from the Canadian Authors Association and an American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation. Kogawa adapted the book for children as &quot;Naomi&#x27;s Road&quot; in 1985.

A sequel, &quot;Itsuka&quot; (1992), was rewritten and retitled &quot;Emily Kato&quot; (2005), and then republished as &quot;Itsuka&quot; (2018).

&quot;Obasan&quot; has been named as one of the most important books in Canadian history by the &quot;Literary Review of Canada&quot; and was also listed by &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; in a &quot;Best of Canada&quot; feature. &quot;Obasan&quot; was later adapted into a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Naomi&#x27;s Road&quot; (1986), which, in turn, Vancouver Opera adapted into a 45-minute opera that toured elementary schools throughout British Columbia. The opera was also performed before the general public in the greater Vancouver area, Red Deer and Lethbridge, Alberta, Seattle, Washington, and Ottawa, Ontario, at the National War Museum. Revival performances in November 2016 by Toronto&#x27;s Tapestry Opera won rave reviews, especially in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, which recognized their setting as one &quot;steeped in significance&quot;.

Although the novel &quot;Obasan&quot; describes Japanese Canadian experiences, it is routinely taught in Asian American literature courses in the United States, due to its successful &quot;integration of political understanding and literary artistry&quot; and &quot;its authentication of a pan-Asian sensibility.&quot;

Kogawa now lives mainly in Toronto, Ontario, but at one time divided her time between Vancouver and Toronto and was the 2012–13 Writer-in-Residence at the University of Toronto. In 2018, Kogawa formed a group called Yojaros with a Vancouver-based Japanese poet Soramaru Takayama.

Kogawa wrote the narrative for the augmented reality game &quot;East of the Rockies&quot;, produced by the National Film Board of Canada and released in 2019. The project won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Video Game Narrative at the 8th Canadian Screen Awards in 2020.

The home of the last Japanese-Canadian Anglican parish in Vancouver is Holy Cross church.

== Recognition ==

In 1986, Kogawa was made a Member of the Order of Canada; in 2006, she was made a Member of the Order of British Columbia.

In 2010, the Japanese government honored Kogawa with the Order of the Rising Sun &quot;for her contribution to the understanding and preservation of Japanese Canadian history.&quot;

Kogawa has been awarded several honorary doctorates. The most recent was by the University of Saskatchewan on November 10, 2020.

== Campaign to save Kogawa House ==

The Save Kogawa House committee initiated a campaign to save Kogawa&#x27;s childhood home, owned by her father Gordon Goichi Nakayama, in the Marpole neighbourhood of Vancouver from demolition. They developed national support from writers and writing organizations across Canada demonstrating that the house at 1450 West 64th Avenue was regarded by many as having historical value and literary significance, similar to Berton House, Emily Carr House and the Haig-Brown Institute. The Save Kogawa House committee made a successful presentation to the City of Vancouver councilors to create an unprecedented 120-day delay of the processing of a demolition permit on November 3, 2005, two days after the city had pronounced Obasan Cherry Tree Day and planted a graft of the cherry tree at Vancouver City Hall from the original tree at Kogawa House.

The Land Conservancy of British Columbia became involved in the saving of Kogawa House on December 2, 2005. Working with the Save Kogawa House committee, TLC took over the fund-raising efforts and media attention. TLC became the owner of the house on May 31, 2006. Ownership transferred to the City of Vancouver in 2016. They now are raising funds to renovate the house to increase accessibility and restore its appearance when Joy lived there in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

Kogawa House was recommended to be given heritage status by the City of Vancouver and was placed on City Council&#x27;s agenda for July 12, 2022. Within the available application papers and heritage designation papers presented to the public and City Council for review, however, no mention was made of the house&#x27;s heritage connection to the home&#x27;s former owner Mr. Nakayama, a pedophile priest who abused hundreds of children. Community members raised concern that the heritage application misled the City and the public by openly ignoring parts of the home&#x27;s history. On July 11, 2022, the agenda item covering the heritage status vote was removed in order to address the community&#x27;s concerns.

The Historic Joy Kogawa House Society has operated a writer-in-residence program in the house since 2008. They have hosted four writers to date: poet and editor Dr. John Asfour of Montreal in 2009, novelist and writing educator Nancy Lee of Richmond in 2010, creative non-fiction author Susan Crean in 2011, short-fiction author Deborah Willis in 2012, and PEN Canada writer-in-exile, novelist, editor, freelance journalist, and faculty member Ava Homa in 2013.

<text>Southern Rhodesia was a landlocked, self-governing British Crown colony in Southern Africa, established in 1923 and consisting of British South Africa Company (BSAC) territories lying south of the Zambezi River. The region was informally known as South Zambesia until annexation by Britain, at the behest of Cecil Rhodes&#x27;s British South Africa Company (for whom the colony was named). The bounding territories were Bechuanaland (Botswana), Northern Rhodesia (Zambia), Portuguese Mozambique (Mozambique) and the Transvaal Republic (for two brief periods known as the British Transvaal Colony; from 1910, the Union of South Africa and, from 1961, the Republic of South Africa).

This southern region, known for its extensive gold reserves, was first purchased by the BSAC&#x27;s Pioneer Column on the strength of a Mineral Concession extracted from its Matabele king, Lobengula, and various majority Mashona vassal chiefs in 1890. Though parts of the territory were laid-claim-to by the Bechuana and Portugal, its first people, the &quot;Bushmen&quot; (or Sān or Khoisan), had possessed it for countless centuries beforehand and had continued to inhabit the region. Following the colony&#x27;s unilateral dissolution in 1970 by the Republic of Rhodesia government, the Colony of Southern Rhodesia was re-established in 1979 as the predecessor state to the Republic of Zimbabwe Rhodesia which, in-turn, was the predecessor state of the Republic of Zimbabwe. Its only true geographical borders were the rivers Zambezi and Limpopo, its other boundaries being (more or less) arbitrary, and merging imperceptibly with the peoples and domains of earlier chiefdoms of pre-colonial times.

The British colony was established &quot;de jure&quot; in 1923, having earlier been occupied, constructed and administered by the British South Africa Company and its sub-concessionaires who were mostly British subjects. In 1953, it was merged into the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which lasted until 1963. Southern Rhodesia was renamed Rhodesia and remained a &quot;de jure&quot; British colony until 1980. However, the Rhodesian government issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965 and established a fully independent Rhodesia, which immediately became an unrecognised state. In 1979, it reconstituted itself under majority rule as Zimbabwe Rhodesia, which also failed to win international recognition. After a period of interim British control following the Lancaster House Agreement in December 1979, the country achieved internationally recognised independence as Zimbabwe in April 1980.

==History==

===Origin as &quot;Rhodesia&quot;===


Initially, the territory was referred to as &quot;South Zambezia&quot;, a reference to the River Zambezi, until the name &quot;Rhodesia&quot; came into use in 1895. This was in honour of Cecil Rhodes, the British empire-builder and key figure during the British expansion into southern Africa. In 1888 Rhodes obtained mineral rights from the most powerful local traditional leaders through treaties such as the Rudd Concession and the Moffat Treaty, which was signed by King Lobengula of the Ndebele people. &quot;Southern&quot; was first used in 1898 and dropped from normal usage in 1964, on the break-up of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. &quot;Rhodesia&quot; then remained the name of the country until the creation of Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979. Legally, from the British perspective, the name Southern Rhodesia continued to be used until 18 April 1980, when the Republic of Zimbabwe was promulgated.

The British government agreed that Rhodes&#x27; company, the British South Africa Company (BSAC), would administer the territory stretching from the Limpopo to Lake Tanganyika under charter as a protectorate. Queen Victoria signed the charter in 1889. Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column, a group of white settlers protected by well-armed British South Africa Police (BSAP) and guided by the big game hunter Frederick Selous, through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (now Harare). In 1893–1894, with the help of their new Maxim guns, the BSAP defeated the Ndebele in the First Matabele War, a war which also resulted in the death of King Lobengula and the death of most of the members of the Shangani Patrol. Shortly after the disastrous BSAP Jameson Raid into the Transvaal Republic, the Ndebele were led by their spiritual leader Mlimo against the white colonials and thus began the Second Matabele War (1896–97) which resulted in the extermination of nearly half the British settlers. After months of bloodshed, Mlimo was found and shot by the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham and soon thereafter Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms, effectively ending the revolt.

A legislative council was created in 1899 to manage the company&#x27;s civil affairs, with a minority of elected seats, through which the BSAC had to pass government measures. As the company was a British institution in which settlers and capitalists owned most shares, and local black African tribal chiefs the remainder, and the electorate to this council was limited to those shareholders, the electorate was almost exclusively white settlers. Over time as more settlers arrived and a growing number had less than the amount of land required to own a share in the company or where in trades supporting the company as workers, successive activism resulted in first increasing the proportion of elected seats, and eventually allowing non-share holders the right to vote in the election. Prior to about 1918, the opinion among the electorate supported continued BSAC rule but opinion changed because of the development of the country and increased settlement. In addition, a decision in the British courts that land not in private ownership belonged to the British Crown rather than the BSAC gave great impetus to the campaign for self-government. In the resulting treaty government self-government, Crown lands which were sold to settlers allowed those settlers the right to vote in the self-governing colony.

===Century up to independence===

The territory north of the Zambezi was the subject of separate treaties with African chiefs: today, it forms the country of Zambia. The first BSAC Administrator for the western part was appointed for Barotseland in 1897 and for the whole of North-Western Rhodesia in 1900. The first BSAC Administrator for the eastern part, North-Eastern Rhodesia, was appointed in 1895. The whites in the territory south of the river paid it scant regard though, and generally used the name &quot;Rhodesia&quot; in a narrow sense to mean their part. The designation &quot;Southern Rhodesia&quot; was first used officially in 1898 in the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council of 20 October 1898, which applied to the area south of the Zambezi, and was more common after the BSAC merged the administration of the two northern territories as Northern Rhodesia in 1911.

As a result of the various treaties between the BSAC and the black tribes, Acts of Parliament delineating BSAC and Crown Lands, overlapping British colonial commission authority of both areas, the rights of the increasing number of British settlers and their descendants were given secondary review by authorities. This resulted in the formation of new movements for expanding the self-government of the Rhodesian people which saw BSAC rule as an impediment to further expansion.

The Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council election of 1920 returned a large majority of candidates of the Responsible Government Association and it became clear that BSAC rule was no longer practical. Opinion in the United Kingdom and South Africa favored incorporation of Southern Rhodesia in the Union of South Africa, but, by forcing the pace of negotiation, the Southern Rhodesians obtained unfavorable terms and the electorate backed Responsible Government in a 1922 referendum.

In view of the outcome of the referendum, the territory was annexed by the United Kingdom on 12 September 1923. Shortly after annexation, on 1 October 1923, the first constitution for the new Colony of Southern Rhodesia came into force. Under this constitution Sir Charles Coghlan became the first Premier of First Cabinet of Southern Rhodesia and upon his death in 1927 he was succeeded by Howard Unwin Moffat.

During World War II, Southern Rhodesian military units participated on the side of the United Kingdom. Southern Rhodesian support for the Allied war effort was based on a mixture shared kinship and identity with Britain and support for democracy. Southern Rhodesian forces were involved on many fronts including the East and North African campaigns, Italy, Madagascar and Burma. Southern Rhodesian forces had the highest loss ratio of any constituent element, colony, dependency or dominion of the British Empire forces during World War II. Additionally, the Rhodesian pilots earned the highest number of decorations and ace appellations of any group within the Empire. This resulted in the Royal Family paying an unusual state visit to the colony at the end of the war to thank the Rhodesian people.

Economically, Southern Rhodesia developed an economy that was narrowly based on production of a few primary products, notably, chrome and tobacco. It was therefore vulnerable to the economic cycle. The deep recession of the 1930s gave way to a post-war boom. This boom prompted the immigration of about 200,000 white settlers between 1945 and 1970, taking the white population up to 307,000. A large number of these immigrants were of British working-class origin. The black population was about 6 million.

In the 1940s, the founding of a university to serve central African countries was proposed. Such a university was eventually established in Salisbury, with funding provided by the British and Southern Rhodesian governments and some private sources. One condition of British funding was that student admission should be based on &quot;academic achievement and good character&quot; with no racial distinction. University College of Rhodesia (UCR) received its first intake of students in 1952. Until 1971 it awarded degrees of the Universities of London and Birmingham. In 1971 UCR became the University of Rhodesia and began awarding its own degrees. In 1980 it was renamed the University of Zimbabwe.

===1953–1965===

In 1953, with calls for independence mounting in many of its African possessions, the United Kingdom created the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (or the Central African Federation, CAF), which consisted of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland (now Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi, respectively). The idea was to try to steer a middle road between the differing aspirations of the black nationalists, the colonial administration and the white settler population. The CAF sought to emulate the experience of Australia, Canada and South Africa – wherein groups of colonies had been federated together to form viable independent nations. Originally designed to be &quot;an indissoluble federation&quot;, the CAF quickly started to unravel due to the low proportion of British and other white citizens in relation to the larger black populations. Additionally, by incorporating the tribes within the Federation as potential citizens, the Federation created the paradoxical situation of having a white elite owning most of the land and capital, whilst being completely dependent upon cheap black labour.

The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was dissolved on 1 January 1964. However, it was expected that only Nyasaland would be let go, whilst the remainder of Rhodesia both north and south would be united. Although Northern Rhodesia had a white population of over 100,000, as well as additional British military and civil units and their dependents, most of these were relatively new to the region, were primarily in the extraction business, had little landed interests, and were more amenable to allowing black nationalism than the Southern Rhodesians. Accordingly, Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia on 24 October 1964. However, when the new nationalists changed its name to &quot;Zambia&quot; and began tentatively at first and later in rapid march an Africanisation campaign, Southern Rhodesia remained a British colony, resisting attempts to bring in majority rule. The colony attempted to change its name to &quot;Rhodesia&quot; although this was not recognised by the United Kingdom. The majority of the Federation&#x27;s military and financial assets went to Southern Rhodesia, since the British Government did not wish to see them fall into the hands of the nationalist leaders, and since Southern Rhodesia had borne the major expenses of running the Federation. With regard to the latter, however, Northern Rhodesia was the wealthiest of the three member states (due to its vast copper mines) and had contributed more to the overall building of infrastructure than the other two members did. Southern Rhodesia, recognising an inevitable dissolution of the Federation, was quick to use federal funds in building its infrastructure ahead of the others. A key component of this was the building of the Kariba Dam and its hydroelectric facility (shafts, control centre, etc.), which was situated on the Southern Rhodesian side of the Zambezi Gorge. This situation caused some embarrassment for the Zambian government later when it was a &quot;front line state&quot; in support of insurgents into Rhodesia in that its major source of electric power was controlled by the Rhodesian state.

===Return to &quot;Rhodesia&quot;===

With the protectorate of Northern Rhodesia no longer in existence, in 1964, Southern Rhodesia reverted to the name &quot;Rhodesia&quot; (see next section).

In 1965, Rhodesia unilaterally declared itself independent under a white-dominated government led by Ian Smith. After a long civil war ensued between the white (until 1979) government and two African majority, Soviet Bloc-aligned &#x27;liberation movements&#x27; (Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army and Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army). The Salisbury government, realizing the situation was untenable, and facing strong international pressure, concluded the Internal Settlement with black nationalist leaders in March 1978. A general election a year later resulted in the creation of a unity government, which in December 1979 concluded the Lancaster House Agreement, whereby Britain resumed control of the country for a brief period before granting independence to the renamed Zimbabwe on 18 April 1980.

===Legal aspects of the name since 1964===

On 7 October 1964, the Southern Rhodesian government announced that when Northern Rhodesia achieved independence as Zambia, the Southern Rhodesian government would officially become known as the Rhodesian Government and the colony would become known as Rhodesia.

On 23 October of that year, the Minister of Internal Affairs notified the press that the Constitution would be amended to make this official. The Legislative Assembly then passed an Interpretation Bill to declare that the colony could be referred to as Rhodesia. The Bill received its third reading on 9 December 1964, and passed to the Governor for royal assent.

However, no royal assent was granted to the Bill. Section 3 of the Southern Rhodesia (Annexation) Order 1923 provided that Southern Rhodesia &quot;shall be known as the Colony of Southern Rhodesia&quot; and the Southern Rhodesia (Constitution) Act 1961 and the Order-in-Council which followed it both referred to it as such. The country&#x27;s name had been agreed previously by both Southern Rhodesia and the United Kingdom, and it was therefore outside the powers of Southern Rhodesian institutions to amend them unilaterally. Notwithstanding the Governor&#x27;s lack of assent to the Interpretation Bill the United Kingdom&#x27;s Colonial Office was, by 1965, officially using the name &quot;Rhodesia&quot; in British Government-issued Gazettes of the period (for instance see: The 1965 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 12 June 1965).

The Rhodesian government, which had begun using the new name anyway, did not press the issue. The Unilateral Declaration of Independence, adopted on 11 November 1965, was in the name of &quot;Rhodesia&quot;, which remained unchanged by the declaration of a republic in 1970, the title of the republican constitution of 1969, like the constitution before it, being &quot;Constitution of Rhodesia&quot;. Following the Internal Settlement of 1978, the country&#x27;s name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia.

While the new name was widely used, &#x27;Southern Rhodesia&#x27; remained the colony&#x27;s formal name in United Kingdom constitutional theory: for example, the Act passed by the United Kingdom Parliament declaring the independence a legal nullity was entitled the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965.

On 21 December 1979, the Lancaster House Agreement was signed, providing for the country to temporarily return to British rule before transitioning to independence under majority rule following an election. The Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Southern Rhodesia Constitution (Interim Provisions) Order 1979, establishing the offices of Governor and Deputy Governor of Southern Rhodesia, filled by Lord Soames and Sir Antony Duff respectively. Their roles were to administer the country on a caretaker basis and organise an election.

The new Governor arrived in Salisbury on 12 December 1979, and on that day the Parliament of Zimbabwe Rhodesia handed power over to him by passing the Constitution of Zimbabwe Rhodesia (Amendment) (No. 4) Act, declaring that &quot;Zimbabwe Rhodesia shall cease to be an independent State and become part of Her Majesty&#x27;s dominions&quot;. After the 1980 Southern Rhodesian general election, British rule ceased and Zimbabwe became independent at midnight on 17 April 1980.

<doc id="284323" wikidata="Q927851" url="?curid=284323" title="Slovincians">
<text>Slovincians, also known as [[Łeba]] Kashubians, is a near-extinct ethnic subgroup of the Kashubian people, who originated from the north western Kashubia, located in the Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland, from the area around the lakes of Łebsko and Gardno. In the aftermath of World War II, Slovincians emigrated en masse to Germany, with the last families emigrating there in the 1980s. They originally spoke the Slovincian language, which went extinct in the early 20th century, as well as Kashubian, Polish, and German.

== History ==
The ancestors of the Slovincians, the West Slavic Pomeranians, moved in after the Migration Period. Following the Ostsiedlung, the Slovincians like most of the other Wends gradually became Germanized. The adoption of Lutheranism in the Duchy of Pomerania in 1534 distinguished the Slovincians from the Kashubes in Pomerelia, who remained Roman Catholic. In the 16th century, &quot;Slovincian&quot; was also applied to the Slavic speakers in the Bytów (Bütow) region further south.

In the 16th and 17th century Michael Brüggemann (also known as Pontanus or Michał Mostnik), Simon Krofey (Szimon Krofej) and J.M. Sporgius introduced Kashubian into the Lutheran Church. Krofey, pastor in Bytów (Bütow), published a religious song book in 1586, written in Polish but also containing some Kashubian words. Brüggemann, pastor in Schmolsin, published a Polish translation of some works of Martin Luther and biblical texts, which also contained Kashubian elements. Other biblical texts were published in 1700 by Sporgius, pastor in Schmolsin. His &quot;Schmolsiner Perikopen&quot;, most of which is written in the same Polish-Kashubian style of Krofey&#x27;s and Brüggemann&#x27;s books, also contain small passages (&quot;6th Sunday after Epiphanias&quot;) written in pure Kashubian.

Hilferding (1862) and Parczewski (1896) confirmed a progressive language shift in the Kashubian population from their Slavonic vernacular to the local German dialect (Low German Ostpommersch or High German, in eastern Kashubian areas also to Low Prussian).

By the 1920s, the Slovincian villages had become linguistically German, though a Slovincian consciousness remained. The area remained within the borders of Germany until becoming part of Poland after World War II ended in 1945 and the area became Polish. Some Slovincians were expelled along with the German population, some were allowed to remain. In the 1950s, mainly in the village of Kluki (formerly Klucken), a few elderly people still remembered fragments of Slovincian.

The remaining Slovincians began to ask for the right to emigrate to West Germany, and virtually all of the remaining Slovincian families had emigrated there by the 1980s.

<doc id="284325" wikidata="Q257261" url="?curid=284325" title="Madeleine L'Engle">
<text>Madeleine L&#x27;Engle (; November 29, 1918 – September 6, 2007) was an American writer of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and young adult fiction, including &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; and its sequels: &quot;A Wind in the Door&quot;, &quot;A Swiftly Tilting Planet&quot;, &quot;Many Waters&quot;, and &quot;An Acceptable Time&quot;. Her works reflect both her Christian faith and her strong interest in modern science.

==Early life==
Madeleine L&#x27;Engle Camp was born in New York City on November 29, 1918, and named after her great-grandmother, Madeleine Margaret L&#x27;Engle, otherwise known as Mado. Her maternal grandfather was Florida banker Bion Barnett, co-founder of Barnett Bank in Jacksonville, Florida. Her mother, a pianist, was also named Madeleine: Madeleine Hall Barnett. Her father, Charles Wadsworth Camp, was a writer, critic, and foreign correspondent who, according to his daughter, suffered lung damage from mustard gas during World War I.

L&#x27;Engle wrote her first story aged five and began keeping a journal aged eight. These early literary attempts did not translate into academic success at the New York City private school where she was enrolled. A shy, awkward child, she was branded as stupid by some of her teachers. Unable to please them, she retreated into her own world of books and writing. Her parents often disagreed about how to raise her, and as a result she attended a number of boarding schools and had many governesses. 

The Camps traveled frequently. At one point, the family moved to a château near Chamonix in the French Alps, in what Madeleine described as the hope that the cleaner air would be easier on her father&#x27;s lungs. Madeleine was sent to a boarding school in Switzerland. In 1933, L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s grandmother fell ill, and they moved near Jacksonville, Florida to be close to her. L&#x27;Engle attended another boarding school, Ashley Hall, in Charleston, South Carolina. When her father died in October 1936, Madeleine arrived home too late to say goodbye.

==Education, marriage, and family==
L&#x27;Engle attended Smith College from 1937 to 1941. After graduating &quot;cum laude&quot; from Smith, she moved to an apartment in New York City. L&#x27;Engle published her novels &quot;The Small Rain&quot; and &quot;Ilsa&quot; prior to 1942. She met actor Hugh Franklin that year when she appeared in the play &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; by Anton Chekhov, and she married him on January 26, 1946. Later she wrote of their meeting and marriage, &quot;We met in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and were married in &quot;The Joyous Season&quot;.&quot; The couple&#x27;s first daughter, Josephine, was born in 1947.

The family moved to a 200-year-old farmhouse called Crosswicks in the small town of Goshen, Connecticut in 1952. To replace Franklin&#x27;s lost acting income, they purchased and operated a small general store, while L&#x27;Engle continued with her writing. Their son Bion was born that same year. Four years later, seven-year-old Maria, the daughter of family friends who had died, came to live with the Franklins and they adopted her shortly thereafter. During this period, L&#x27;Engle also served as choir director of the local Congregational church.

==Writing career==
L&#x27;Engle determined to give up writing on her 40th birthday (November 1958) when she received yet another rejection notice. &quot;With all the hours I spent writing, I was still not pulling my own weight financially.&quot; Soon she discovered both that she could not give it up and that she had continued to work on fiction subconsciously.

The family returned to New York City in 1959 so that Hugh could resume his acting career. The move was immediately preceded by a ten-week cross-country camping trip, during which L&#x27;Engle first had the idea for her most famous novel, &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;, which she completed by 1960. It was rejected more than thirty times before she handed it to John C. Farrar; it was finally published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 1962.

In 1960 the Franklins moved to an apartment on the Upper West Side, in the Cleburne Building on West End Avenue. From 1960 to 1966 (and again in 1986, 1989 and 1990), L&#x27;Engle taught at St. Hilda&#x27;s &amp; St. Hugh&#x27;s School in New York. In 1965 she became a volunteer librarian at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, also in New York. She later served for many years as writer-in-residence at the cathedral, generally spending her winters in New York and her summers at Crosswicks.

During the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, L&#x27;Engle wrote dozens of books for children and adults. Four of the books for adults formed the &quot;Crosswicks Journals&quot; series of autobiographical memoirs. Of these, &quot;The Summer of the Great-grandmother&quot; (1974) discusses L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s personal experience caring for her aged mother, and &quot;Two-Part Invention&quot; (1988) is a memoir of her marriage, completed after her husband&#x27;s death from cancer on September 26, 1986.

===On writing for children===
Soon after winning the Newbery Medal for her 1962 &quot;junior novel&quot; &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;, L&#x27;Engle discussed children&#x27;s books in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;. The writer of a good children&#x27;s book, she observed, may need to return to the &quot;intuitive understanding of his own childhood,&quot; being &quot;childlike&quot; although not &quot;childish&quot;. She claimed, &quot;It&#x27;s often possible to make demands of a child that couldn&#x27;t be made of an adult... A child will often understand scientific concepts that would baffle an adult. This is because he can understand with a leap of the imagination that is denied the grown-up who has acquired the little knowledge that is a dangerous thing.&quot; Of philosophy, etc., as well as science, &quot;the child will come to it with an open mind, whereas many adults come closed to an open book. This is one reason so many writers turn to fantasy (which children claim as their own) when they have something important and difficult to say.&quot;

==Religious beliefs==
L&#x27;Engle was a Christian who attended Episcopal churches and believed in universal salvation, writing that &quot;All will be redeemed in God&#x27;s fullness of time, all, not just the small portion of the population who have been given the grace to know and accept Christ. All the strayed and stolen sheep. All the little lost ones.&quot; As a result of her promotion of Christian universalism, many Christian bookstores refused to carry her books, which were also frequently banned from evangelical Christian schools and libraries. At the same time, some of her most secular critics attacked her work for being far too religious.

Her views on divine punishment were similar to those of George MacDonald, who also had a large influence on her fictional work. She said &quot;I cannot believe that God wants punishment to go on interminably any more than does a loving parent. The entire purpose of loving punishment is to teach, and it lasts only as long as is needed for the lesson. And the lesson is always love.&quot;

In 1982, L&#x27;Engle reflected on how suffering had taught her. She told how suffering a &quot;lonely solitude&quot; as a child taught her about the &quot;world of the imagination&quot; that enabled her to write for children. Later she suffered a &quot;decade of failure&quot; after her first books were published. It was a &quot;bitter&quot; experience, yet she wrote that she had &quot;learned a lot of valuable lessons&quot; that enabled her to persevere as a writer.

==Later years, death, and legacy==
In 1972, L&#x27;Engle and her husband, Hugh Franklin, established the Crosswicks Foundation, a family foundation.

L&#x27;Engle was seriously injured in an automobile accident in 1991, but recovered well enough to visit Antarctica in 1992. Her son, Bion Franklin, died on December 17, 1999, from the effects of prolonged alcoholism. He was 47 years old.

In her final years, L&#x27;Engle became unable to teach or travel due to reduced mobility from osteoporosis, especially after suffering an intracerebral hemorrhage in 2002. She also abandoned her former schedule of speaking engagements and seminars. A few compilations of older work, some of it previously unpublished, appeared after 2001.

L&#x27;Engle died of natural causes at Rose Haven, a nursing facility close to her home in Litchfield, Connecticut, on September 6, 2007, according to a statement made by her publicist the following day.
She is interred in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan.

In 2018, her granddaughters Charlotte Jones Voiklis and Léna Roy published &quot;Becoming Madeleine: A Biography of the Author of A Wrinkle in Time by Her Granddaughters&quot;.

&quot;A Light So Lovely: The Spiritual Legacy of Madeleine L’Engle&quot; by Sarah Arthur was also published in 2018.

L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; was adapted into a film twice by Disney. A television film, directed by John Kent Harrison, premiered on May 10, 2004. When asked in an interview with &quot;Newsweek&quot; if the film &quot;met her expectations&quot;, L&#x27;Engle said, &quot;I have glimpsed it. ... I expected it to be bad, and it is.&quot; A theatrical film, directed by Ava DuVernay, premiered March 9, 2018.

In celebration of L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s centenary year, Writing for Your Life hosted the inaugural Madeleine L&#x27;Engle Conference: Walking on Water on November 16, 2019, in New York City, New York, at All Angels&#x27; Church on the Upper West Side. Katherine Paterson served as the keynote speaker.

==Awards, honors, and organizations==
In addition to the numerous awards, medals, and prizes won by individual books L&#x27;Engle wrote, she personally received many honors over the years. These included being named an Associate Dame of Justice in the Venerable Order of Saint John (1972); the USM Medallion from The University of Southern Mississippi (1978); the Smith College Medal &quot;for service to community or college which exemplifies the purposes of liberal arts education&quot; (1981); the Sophia Award for distinction in her field (1984); the Regina Medal (1985); the ALAN Award for outstanding contribution to adolescent literature, presented by the National Council of Teachers of English (1987); and the Kerlan Award (1991).

In 1985 she was a guest speaker at the Library of Congress, giving a speech entitled &quot;Dare to be Creative!&quot; That same year she began a two-year term as president of the Authors Guild. In addition she received over a dozen honorary degrees from as many colleges and universities, such as Haverford College. Many of these name her as a Doctor of Humane Letters, but she was also made a Doctor of Literature and a Doctor of Sacred Theology, the latter at Berkeley Divinity School in 1984. In 1995 she was writer-in-residence for &quot;Victoria Magazine&quot;. In 1997 she was recognized for Lifetime Achievement from the World Fantasy Awards.

L&#x27;Engle received the annual Margaret A. Edwards Award from the American Library Association in 1998. The Edwards Award recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for a &quot;significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature.&quot; Four books by L&#x27;Engle were cited: &quot;Meet the Austins&quot;, &quot;A Wrinkle In Time&quot;, &quot;A Swiftly Tilting Planet&quot;, and &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot; (published 1960 to 1980). In 2004 she received the National Humanities Medal but could not attend the ceremony due to poor health.

L&#x27;Engle was inducted into the New York Writers Hall of Fame in 2011.

In a 2012 survey of &quot;School Library Journal&quot; readers, &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; was voted the best children&#x27;s novel after &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;.

In 2013, a crater on Mercury was named after L&#x27;Engle.

At Smith College, a fellowship is available in L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s name to visit and use the special collections available there. This fund provides stipends to support travel by researchers—from novices to advanced, award-winning scholars—to explore the resources available in the Smith College Archives, Mortimer Rare Book Collection, and Sophia Smith Collection of Women&#x27;s History.

===The Madeleine L&#x27;Engle Collection===
Since 1976, Wheaton College in Illinois has maintained a special collection of L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s papers, and a variety of other materials, dating back to 1919. The Madeleine L&#x27;Engle Collection includes manuscripts for the majority of her published and unpublished works, as well as interviews, photographs, audio and video presentations, and an extensive array of correspondence with both adults and children, including artwork sent to her by children.

In 2019, a collection of 43 linear feet of L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s family, personal, and literary papers came to the Sophia Smith Collection of Women&#x27;s History at Smith College. They had been donated by her literary estate.

==Bibliographic overview==

Most of L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s novels from &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; onward are centered on a cast of recurring characters, who sometimes reappear decades older than when they were first introduced. The &quot;Kairos&quot; books are about the Murry and O&#x27;Keefe families, with Meg Murry and Calvin O&#x27;Keefe marrying and producing the next generation&#x27;s protagonist, Polyhymnia O&#x27;Keefe. L&#x27;Engle wrote about both generations concurrently, with Polly (originally spelled Poly) first appearing in 1965, well before the second book about her parents as teenagers (&quot;A Wind in the Door&quot;, 1973). The &quot;Chronos&quot; books center on Vicky Austin and her siblings. Although Vicky&#x27;s appearances all occur during her childhood and teenage years, her sister Suzy also appears as an adult in &quot;A Severed Wasp&quot;, with a husband and teenage children. In addition, two of L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s early protagonists, Katherine Forrester and Camilla Dickinson, reappear as elderly women in later novels. Rounding out the cast are several characters &quot;who cross and connect&quot;: Canon Tallis, Adam Eddington, and Zachary Gray, who each appear in both the Kairos and Chronos books.

In addition to novels and poetry, L&#x27;Engle wrote many nonfiction works, including the autobiographical &quot;Crosswicks Journals&quot; and other explorations of the subjects of faith and art. For L&#x27;Engle, who wrote repeatedly about &quot;story as truth&quot;, the distinction between fiction and memoir was sometimes blurred. Real events from her life and family history made their way into some of her novels, while fictional elements, such as assumed names for people and places, can be found in her published journals.
