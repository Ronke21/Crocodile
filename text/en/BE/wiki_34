<text>Vitiges (also known as Vitigis, Vitigo, Witiges or Wittigis, and in Old Norse as Vigo) (died 542) was king of Ostrogothic Italy from 536 to 540. He succeeded to the throne of Italy in the early stages of the Gothic War of 535–554, as Belisarius had quickly captured Sicily the previous year and was in southern Italy at the head of the forces of Justinian I, the Eastern Roman Emperor.

Vitiges was the husband of Queen Amalasuntha&#x27;s only surviving child, Matasuntha; therefore, his royal legitimacy was based on this marriage. The panegyric upon the wedding in 536 was delivered by Cassiodorus, the praetorian prefect, and survives, a traditionally Roman form of rhetoric that set the Gothic dynasty in a flatteringly Roman light. Soon after he was made king, Vitiges had his predecessor Theodahad murdered. Theodahad had enraged the Goths because he failed to send any assistance to Naples when it was besieged by the Byzantines, led by Belisarius.

Belisarius took both Vitiges and Matasuntha captive to Constantinople, and Vitiges died there in 542, without any children. Procopius described parallels among the deposition of Vitiges and Croesus, king of Lydia. After his death, Matasuntha married the patrician Germanus Justinus, a cousin of Justinian I through his uncle Justin I.

==Legend==
Witige (in Norse Viðga) is one of the heroes of epic literature that flourished around the figure of Dietrich von Bern (Theodoric of Verona).
Witige is the son of the mythical blacksmith Wieland and at the age of twelve, he leaves his father&#x27;s house to seek adventure. Arriving in Bern (Verona), he challenges the young prince Dietrich to a duel and defeats him thanks to the sword given to him by his father, Mimminc. Dietrich and Witege make a pact of brotherhood. Among the heroes in Dietrich&#x27;s service are the old Hildebrand and the brave Heime.
The Hun king Etzel asks Dietrich for help in a military campaign against the Swedish king Ósantrix. During the battle, Witege is captured and Vildifer, his faithful friend, concocts a ruse to free him: Vildifer disguises himself as a bear and infiltrates the court of Ósantrix in the guise of a dancing bear following a minstrel. In this way, he discovers where Witege is being held prisoner, attacks King Ósantrix, kills him, and frees his friend.

Following the episode, a quarrel between Witege and Heime over the ownership of the sword Mimminc, which the latter had taken after the former had been captured and left for dead. Witege gets his sword back and the two swear friendship.
To win the hand of the beautiful Bolfrina, Witege leaves Dietrich&#x27;s court and swears allegiance to King Ermrich, Dietrich&#x27;s uncle. When Ermrich declares war on his nephew, Witege is forced to side with Ermrich: Dietrich flees before the enemy army and takes refuge at the court of Etzel, king of the Huns.
After several years, Dietrich, thanks to Etzel&#x27;s support, organizes a campaign to reconquer his kingdom. Dietrich still trusts in Witege&#x27;s friendship, but, he continues faithful to Ermrich. During a duel, Witege is forced to kill Orte and Scharphe, Etzel&#x27;s sons, and Diether, Dietrich&#x27;s brother, all three still children. Dietrich is furious and sets out in pursuit of Witege, who to save himself throws himself into the sea, where the mermaid Wachilde, his ancestor, welcomes him.

Transported by the mermaid to Zealand, Witege lives for many years on a deserted island giving specific orders to the ferryman not to allow Dietrich there, of whom he provides a statue. Dietrich, however, finds Witege&#x27;s hiding place and, wanting to avenge his brother Diether at all costs, has one of his eyes removed so as not to be recognized by the ferryman. Having reached Witege&#x27;s home, Dietrich steals the hero&#x27;s sword Mimminc, then challenges him to a duel. Witege, deprived of his best weapon, is overwhelmed and dies, but not before inflicting deep wounds on his opponent. Dietrich, after throwing Mimminc into a lake, dies from the wounds inflicted on him by Witege.

==In fiction==
Vitiges appears as a character in the time travel novel &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot;, by L. Sprague de Camp. He is portrayed by Florin Piersic in the 1968 film &quot;Kampf um Rom.&quot;

<doc id="277776" wikidata="Q193245" url="?curid=277776" title="Carnation Revolution">
<text>The Carnation Revolution (), also known as the 25 April (), was a military coup by military officers that overthrew the Estado Novo government on 25 April 1974 in Lisbon, producing major social, economic, territorial, demographic, and political changes in Portugal and its overseas colonies through the Processo Revolucionário Em Curso. It resulted in the Portuguese transition to democracy and the end of the Portuguese Colonial War.

The revolution began as a coup organised by the Armed Forces Movement (, MFA), composed of military officers who opposed the regime, but it was soon coupled with an unanticipated popular civil resistance campaign. Negotiations with African independence movements began, and by the end of 1974, Portuguese troops were withdrawn from Portuguese Guinea, which became a UN member state as Guinea-Bissau. This was followed in 1975 by the independence of Cape Verde, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe and Angola in Africa and the declaration of independence of East Timor in Southeast Asia. These events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal&#x27;s African territories (mostly from Angola and Mozambique), creating over a million Portuguese &quot;returned&quot; – the &quot;retornados&quot;.

The Carnation Revolution got its name from the fact that almost no shots were fired, and from restaurant worker Celeste Caeiro who offered carnations to soldiers when the population took to the streets to celebrate the end of the dictatorship. Other demonstrators followed suit and placed carnations in the muzzles of guns and on soldiers&#x27; uniforms. In Portugal, 25 April is a national holiday (, Freedom Day) that commemorates the revolution.

==Background==

By the 1970s, nearly a half-century of authoritarian rule weighed on Portugal. The 28 May 1926 coup d&#x27;état implemented an authoritarian regime incorporating social Catholicism and integralism. In 1933, the regime was renamed the Estado Novo (New State). António de Oliveira Salazar served as Prime Minister until 1968.

In sham elections the government candidate usually ran unopposed, while the opposition used the limited political freedoms allowed during the brief election period to protest, withdrawing their candidates before the election to deny the regime political legitimacy. 

The Estado Novo&#x27;s political police, the PIDE (Polícia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado, later the DGS, Direcção-Geral de Segurança and originally the PVDE, Polícia de Vigilância e Defesa do Estado), persecuted opponents of the regime, who were often tortured, imprisoned or killed.

In 1958, General Humberto Delgado, a former member of the regime, stood against the regime&#x27;s presidential candidate, Américo Tomás, and refused to allow his name to be withdrawn. Tomás won the election amidst claims of widespread electoral fraud, and the Salazar government abandoned the practice of popularly electing the president and gave the task to the National Assembly.

Portugal&#x27;s Estado Novo government remained neutral in the Second World War, and was initially tolerated by its NATO post-war partners due to its anti-communist stance. As the Cold War developed, Western Bloc and Eastern Bloc states vied with each other in supporting guerrillas in the Portuguese colonies, leading to the 1961–1974 Portuguese Colonial War.

Salazar had a stroke in 1968, and was replaced as prime minister by Marcelo Caetano, who adopted a slogan of &quot;continuous evolution&quot;, suggesting reforms, such as a monthly pension to rural workers who had never contributed to Portugal&#x27;s social security. Caetano&#x27;s Primavera Marcelista (Marcelist Spring) included greater political tolerance and freedom of the press, and was seen as an opportunity for the opposition to gain concessions from the regime. In 1969, Caetano authorised the country&#x27;s first democratic labour union movement since the 1920s. However, after the elections of 1969 and 1973, hard-liners in the government and the military pushed back against Caetano, with political repression against communists and anti-colonialists.

===Economic conditions===
The Estado Novo regime&#x27;s economic policy encouraged the formation of large conglomerates. The regime maintained a policy of corporatism which resulted in the placement of much of the economy in the hands of conglomerates including those founded by the families of António Champalimaud (Banco Totta &amp; Açores, Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor, Secil, Cimpor), José Manuel de Mello (Companhia União Fabril), Américo Amorim (Corticeira Amorim) and the dos Santos family (Jerónimo Martins).

One of the largest was the Companhia União Fabril (CUF), with a wide range of interests including cement, petro and agro chemicals, textiles, beverages, naval and electrical engineering, insurance, banking, paper, tourism and mining, with branches, plants and projects throughout the Portuguese Empire.

Other medium-sized family companies specialised in textiles (such as those in Covilhã and the northwest), ceramics, porcelain, glass and crystal (such as those in Alcobaça, Caldas da Rainha and Marinha Grande), engineered wood (such as SONAE, near Porto), canned fish (Algarve and the northwest), fishing, food and beverages (liqueurs, beer and port wine), tourism (in Estoril, Cascais, Sintra and the Algarve) and agriculture (the Alentejo, known as the breadbasket of Portugal) by the early-1970s. Rural families engaged in agriculture and forestry.

Income from the colonies came from resource extraction, of oil, coffee, cotton, cashews, coconuts, timber, minerals (including diamonds), metals (such as iron and aluminium), bananas, citrus, tea, sisal, beer, cement, fish and other seafood, beef and textiles. Labour unions were subject to severe restrictions, and minimum wage laws were not enforced. Starting in the 1960s, the outbreak of colonial wars in Africa set off significant social changes, among them the rapid incorporation of women into the labour market.

===Colonial war===


Independence movements began in the African colonies of Portuguese Mozambique, Portuguese Congo, Portuguese Angola, and Portuguese Guinea. The Salazar and Caetano regimes responded with diverting more and more of Portugal&#x27;s budget to colonial administration and military expenditure, and the country became increasingly isolated from the rest of the world, facing increasing internal dissent, arms embargoes and other international sanctions.

By the early-1970s, the Portuguese military was overstretched and there was no political solution in sight. Although the number of casualties was relatively small, the war had entered its second decade; Portugal faced criticism from the international community, and was becoming increasingly isolated. In 1973 the UN General Assembly passed a resolution calling for Portugal&#x27;s immediate withdrawal from Guinea. Atrocities such as the Wiriyamu Massacre undermined the war&#x27;s popularity and the government&#x27;s diplomatic position, although details of the massacre are still disputed.

The war became unpopular in Portugal, and the country became increasingly polarised. Thousands of left-wing students and anti-war activists avoided conscription by emigrating illegally, primarily to France and the United States. Meanwhile three generations of right-wing militants in Portuguese schools were guided by a revolutionary nationalism partially influenced by European neo-fascism, and supported the Portuguese Empire and an authoritarian regime.

The war had a profound impact on the country. The revolutionary Armed Forces Movement (MFA) began as an attempt to liberate Portugal from the Estado Novo regime and challenge new military laws which were coming into force. The laws would reduce the military budget and reformulate the Portuguese military. Younger military-academy graduates resented Caetano&#x27;s programme of commissioning militia officers who completed a brief training course and had served in the colonies&#x27; defensive campaigns at the same rank as academy graduates.

==Revolution==
In February 1974, Caetano decided to remove General António de Spínola from the command of Portuguese forces in Guinea in the face of Spínola&#x27;s increasing disagreement with the promotion of military officers and the direction of Portuguese colonial policy. This occurred shortly after the publication of Spínola&#x27;s book, &quot;Portugal and the Future&quot;, which expressed his political and military views of the Portuguese Colonial War. Several military officers who opposed the war formed the MFA to overthrow the government in a military coup. The MFA was headed by Vítor Alves, Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho and Vasco Lourenço, and was joined later by Salgueiro Maia. The movement was aided by other Portuguese army officers who supported Spínola and democratic civil and military reform.

The coup had two secret signals. First, the disc jockey at Emissores Associados de Lisboa gave the time signal &quot;Falta cinco minutos às vinte e três&quot; at 10:55 p.m. on 24 April before turntabling Paulo de Carvalho&#x27;s &quot;E Depois do Adeus&quot; (Portugal&#x27;s entry in the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest). This alerted rebel captains and soldiers to begin the coup. The second signal came at 12:20 a.m. on 25 April, when Rádio Renascença broadcast &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot; (a song by Zeca Afonso, an influential political folk musician and singer, many of whose songs were banned from Portuguese radio at the time). The MFA gave the signals to take over strategic points of power in the country. The content of the songs was largely uncontroversial—censorship would have prevented more inflammatory songs—their broadcasting was a signal, not a direct call to arms.

Six hours later, the Caetano government relented. Despite repeated radio appeals from the &quot;captains of April&quot; (the MFA) advising civilians to stay home, thousands of Portuguese took to the streets – mingling with, and supporting, the military insurgents. A central gathering point was the Lisbon flower market, then richly stocked with carnations (which were in season). Some of the insurgents put carnations in their gun barrels, an image broadcast on television worldwide which gave the revolution its name. Although no mass demonstrations preceded the coup, spontaneous civilian involvement turned the military coup into a popular revolution &quot;led by radical army officers, soldiers, workers and peasants that toppled the senile Salazar dictatorship, using the language of socialism and democracy. The attempt to radicalise the outcome&quot;, noted a contemporary observer of the time, &quot;had little mass support and was easily suppressed by the Socialist Party and its allies.&quot;

Caetano found refuge in the main headquarters of the Lisbon military police, the National Republican Guard, at the Largo do Carmo. This building was surrounded by the MFA, which pressured him to cede power to General Spínola. Caetano and President Américo Tomás were sent to Brazil; Caetano spent the rest of his life there, and Tomás returned to Portugal a few years later. The revolution was closely watched by neighbouring Spain, where the government (and the opposition) were planning the succession of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. Franco died a year and a half later, in 1975.

Four civilians were shot dead by government forces under the Directorate General of Security, whose personnel involved were later arrested by the MFA for their murders.

==Aftermath==

After the coup, power was held by the National Salvation Junta (a military junta). Portugal experienced a turbulent period, known as the Processo Revolucionário Em Curso (Ongoing Revolutionary Process).

The conservative forces surrounding Spinola and the MFA radicals initially confronted each other covertly or overtly, and Spinola was forced to appoint key MFA figures to senior security positions. Right-wing military figures attempted an unsuccessful counter-coup, leading to Spinola&#x27;s removal from office. Unrest within the MFA between leftist forces often close to the Communist Party, and more moderate groups often allied with the Socialists eventually led to the group&#x27;s splintering and dissolution.

This stage of the PREC lasted until the coup of 25 November 1975, led by a group of far-left officers, specifically Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho. It was said to be a Communist plot to seize power, in order to discredit the powerful Communist Party. It was followed by a successful counter-coup by more centrist officers, and was marked by constant friction between liberal-democratic forces and leftist-communist political parties. Portugal&#x27;s first free election was held on 25 April 1975 to write a new constitution replacing the 1933 constitution in force during the Estado Novo era. Another election was held in 1976, and the first constitutional government, led by centre-left socialist Mário Soares, took office.

===Decolonisation===

Before April 1974, the intractable Portuguese colonial war in Africa consumed up to 40 percent of the Portuguese budget. Although part of Guinea-Bissau became independent &quot;de facto&quot; in 1973, Bissau (its capital) and the large towns were still under Portuguese control. In Angola and Mozambique independence movements were active in more remote rural areas from which the Portuguese Army had retreated.

A consequence of the Carnation Revolution was the sudden withdrawal of Portuguese administrative and military personnel from its overseas colonies. Hundreds of thousands of Portuguese Africans returned to Portugal, becoming known as the &quot;retornados&quot;. These people—workers, small business people, and farmers—often had deep roots in the former colonies.

Angola began a decades-long civil war which involved the Soviet Union, Cuba, South Africa, and the United States. Millions of Angolans died in the aftermath of independence due to armed conflict, malnutrition and disease. After a brief period of stability, Mozambique became embroiled in a civil war which left it one of the poorest nations in the world. The country&#x27;s situation improved after the 1990s, and multi-party elections have been held.

East Timor was invaded by Indonesia, and remained occupied until 1999. There were an estimated 102,800 conflict-related deaths from 1974 to 1999 (about 18,600 killings and 84,200 deaths from hunger and illness), most of which were incurred during the Indonesian occupation.

After a long period of one-party rule, Guinea-Bissau experienced a brief civil war and a difficult transition to civilian rule in 1998. Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe avoided civil war during the decolonisation period, and established multi-party political systems by the early 1990s. By a treaty signed in 1974, Portugal recognised the incorporation of former Portuguese India into India. The 1961 annexation of the tiny Portuguese colony of Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá by Benin was also recognised by Portugal in 1975.

A 1978 Portuguese offer to return Macau to China was refused, as the Chinese government did not want to risk jeopardising negotiations with the UK over returning Hong Kong. The territory remained a Portuguese colony until 1999, when it was transferred to China with a joint declaration, and enacted a &quot;one country, two systems&quot; policy similar to that of Hong Kong.

===Economic issues===

The Portuguese economy changed significantly between 1961 and 1973. Total output (GDP at factory cost) had grown by 120 percent in real terms. The pre-revolutionary period was characterised by robust annual growth in GDP (6.9 percent), industrial production (nine percent), consumption (6.5 percent), and gross fixed capital formation (7.8 percent). The revolutionary period experienced a slowly-growing economy, whose only impetus was its 1986 entrance into the European Economic Community. Although Portugal never regained its pre-revolution growth, at the time of the revolution it was an underdeveloped country with poor infrastructure, inefficient agriculture and some of the worst health and education indicators in Europe.

Pre-revolutionary Portugal had some social and economic achievements. After a long period of economic decline before 1914, the Portuguese economy recovered slightly until 1950. It began a period of economic growth in common with Western Europe, of which it was the poorest country until the 1980s. Portuguese economic growth between 1960 and 1973 (under the Estado Novo regime) created an opportunity for integration with the developed economies of Western Europe despite the colonial war. Through emigration, trade, tourism and foreign investment, individuals and companies changed their patterns of production and consumption. The increasing complexity of a growing economy sparked new technical and organisational challenges.

On 13 November 1972, Fundo do Ultramar (The Overseas Fund, a sovereign wealth fund) was enacted with Decreto-Lei n.º 448/ /72 and the Ministry of Defence ordinance Portaria 696/72 to finance the war. The increasing burden of the war effort meant that the government had to find continuous sources of financing. Decreto-Lei n.º 353, of 13 July 1973 and Decreto-Lei n.º 409 of 20 August 1973 were enforced to reduce military expenses and increase the number of officers by incorporating militia and military-academy officers as equals.

According to government estimates, about of agricultural land were seized between April 1974 and December 1975 as part of land reform; about 32 percent of the appropriations were ruled illegal. In January 1976, the government pledged to restore the illegally occupied land to its owners in 1976, and enacted the Land Reform Review Law the following year. Restoration of illegally occupied land began in 1978.

In 1960, Portugal&#x27;s per-capita GDP was 38 percent of the European Economic Community average. By the end of the Salazar period in 1968 it had risen to 48 percent, and in 1973 it had reached 56.4 percent; the percentages were affected by the 40 percent of the budget which underwrote the African wars. In 1975 (the year of greatest revolutionary turmoil), Portugal&#x27;s per-capita GDP declined to 52.3 percent of the EEC average. Due to revolutionary economic policies, oil shocks, recession in Europe and the return of hundreds of thousands of overseas Portuguese from its former colonies, Portugal began an economic crisis in 1974–1975.

Real gross domestic product growth resumed as a result of Portugal&#x27;s economic resurgence since 1985 and adhesion to the European Economic Community (EEC). The country&#x27;s 1991 per-capita GDP reached 54.9 percent of the EEC average, slightly exceeding the level at the height of the revolutionary period.

A January 2011 story in the &quot;Diário de Notícias&quot; (a Portuguese tabloid format newspaper) reported that the government of Portugal encouraged overspending and investment bubbles in public-private partnerships between 1974 and 2010, and the economy has been damaged by risky credit, public debt creation, overstaffing in the public sector, a rigid labour market and mismanaged European Union&#x27;s structural and cohesion funds for almost four decades. Prime Minister José Sócrates&#x27; cabinet was unable to foresee or forestall this when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and could not ameliorate the situation when Portugal was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2011 and required financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union.

===Freedom of religion===
The constitution of 1976 guarantees all religions the right to practise, and non-Catholic groups are recognised as legal entities with the right to assemble. Non-Catholic conscientious objectors have the right to apply for alternative military service. The Catholic Church, however, still sought to impede other missionary activity.

==Legacy==

Construction of what is now called the 25 de Abril Bridge began on 5 November 1962. It opened on 6 August 1966 as the Salazar Bridge, named after Estado Novo leader António de Oliveira Salazar. Soon after the Carnation Revolution of 1974, the bridge was renamed the 25 de Abril Bridge to commemorate the revolution. Citizens who removed the large, brass &quot;Salazar&quot; sign from a main pillar of the bridge and painted a provisional &quot;25 de Abril&quot; in its place were recorded on film.

Many Portuguese streets and squares are named &quot;vinte e cinco de Abril&quot; (25 April), for the day of the revolution. The Portuguese Mint chose the 40th anniversary of the Carnation Revolution for its 2014 2 euro commemorative coin.
===Freedom Day===
Freedom Day (25 April) is a national holiday, with state-sponsored and spontaneous commemorations of the civil liberties and political freedoms achieved after the revolution. It commemorates the 25 April 1974 revolution and Portugal&#x27;s first free elections on that date the following year.

<text>The general classification of the Tour de France is the most important classification of the race and determines the winner of the race. Since 1919, the leader of the general classification has worn the yellow jersey ( ).

==History==

For the first two Tour de France races, the general classification standings were decided based on the lowest cumulative time. The winner of the first several Tour de France races wore a green armband instead of a yellow jersey. After the second Tour de France, the rules were changed, and the general classification was no longer calculated by time, but by points. This points system was kept until 1912, after which it changed back to the time classification.

There is doubt over when the yellow jersey began. The Belgian rider Philippe Thys, who won the Tour in 1913, 1914 and 1920, recalled in the Belgian magazine &quot;Champions et Vedettes&quot; when he was 67 that he was awarded a yellow jersey in 1913 when the organiser, Henri Desgrange, asked him to wear a coloured jersey. Thys declined, saying making himself more visible in yellow would encourage other riders to ride against him. He saidHe then made his argument from another direction. Several stages later, it was my team manager at Peugeot, (Alphonse) Baugé, who urged me to give in. The yellow jersey would be an advertisement for the company and, that being the argument, I was obliged to concede. So a yellow jersey was bought in the first shop we came to. It was just the right size, although we had to cut a slightly larger hole for my head to go through.

He spoke of the next year&#x27;s race, when &quot;I won the first stage and was beaten by a tyre by Bossus in the second. On the following stage, the maillot jaune passed to Georget after a crash.&quot;

The Tour historian Jacques Augendre called Thys &quot;a valorous rider... well-known for his intelligence&quot; and said his claim &quot;seems free from all suspicion&quot;. But: &quot;No newspaper mentions a yellow jersey before the war. Being at a loss for witnesses, we can&#x27;t solve this enigma.&quot;
According to the official history, the first yellow jersey was worn by the Frenchman Eugène Christophe in the stage from Grenoble to Geneva on July 19, 1919. Christophe disliked wearing it and complained that spectators imitated canaries whenever he passed. There was no formal presentation when Christophe wore his first yellow jersey in Grenoble, from where the race left at 2 am for the 325 km to Geneva. He was given it the night before and tried it on later in his hotel.

The colour was chosen either to reflect the yellow newsprint of the organising newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;, or because yellow was an unpopular colour and therefore the only one available with which a manufacturer could create jerseys at late notice. The two possibilities have been promoted equally but the idea of matching the colour of Desgrange&#x27;s newspaper seems more probable because Desgrange wrote: &quot;This morning I gave the valiant Christophe a superb yellow jersey. You already know that our director decided that the man leading the race [&quot;de tête du classement général&quot;] should wear a jersey in the colours of &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;. The battle to wear this jersey is going to be passionate.&quot;

In the next Tour de France in 1920, the yellow jersey was initially not awarded but after the ninth stage, it was introduced again.
After Desgrange&#x27;s death, his stylized initials were added to the yellow jersey, originally on the chest. They moved in 1969 to the sleeve to make way for a logo advertising Virlux. A further advertisement for the clothing company Le Coq Sportif appeared at the bottom of the zip fastener at the neck, the first supplementary advertisement on the yellow jersey. Desgrange&#x27;s initials returned to the front of the jersey in 1972. They were removed in 1984 to make way for a commercial logo but Nike added them again in 2003 as part of the Tour&#x27;s centenary celebrations. One set of initials is now worn on the upper right chest of the jersey.

In 2013, a nighttime finish on the Champs-Élysées for the final stage was done to commemorate the race&#x27;s 100th edition. Race leader Chris Froome wore a special yellow jersey covered in small translucent sequins into Paris as well as on the podium to allow him to be more visible under the lights.

The original yellow jerseys were of conventional style. Riders had to pull them over their head on the rostrum. For many years the jersey was made in only limited sizes and many riders found it a struggle to pull one on, especially when tired or wet. The presentation jersey is now made with a full-length zip at the back and the rider pulls it on from the front, sliding his hands through the sleeves. He then receives three further jerseys each day, plus money (referred to as the &quot;rent&quot;) for each day he leads the race.

The yellow jersey on the first day of the Tour is traditionally permitted to be worn by the winner of the previous year&#x27;s race; however, wearing it is a choice left to the rider, and in recent years has gone out of fashion. If the winner does not ride, the jersey is not worn.
The previous year&#x27;s winner traditionally has race number &quot;1&quot; (with his teammates given the other single-digit racing numbers), with subsequent sets of numbers determined by the highest classified riders for that team in the previous Tour. The lead riders for a particular team will often wear the first number in the series (11, 21, 31 and so forth), but these riders are not necessarily contenders for the general classification — teams led by sprinters will often designate the points classification contender as their lead rider.

There is no copyright on the yellow jersey and it has been imitated by many other races, although not always for the best rider overall: in the Tour of Benelux yellow is worn by the best young rider. In professional surf, the current male and female leaders of the World Surf League wear a yellow jersey on all the heats of a tour stop.

In American English it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;mellow johnny&quot;, a play on its French name &quot;maillot jaune&quot;, originally by Lance Armstrong, who wore it many times while riding in the 1999–2005 races. Armstrong also uses the name &quot;Mellow Johnny&quot; for his Texas-based bike shop. The Lance Armstrong Foundation donated a yellow jersey from the 2002 Tour de France to the National Museum of American History.

On 19 July 2019, on the occasion of the centenary, a plaque was unveiled on the scene of delivery of the first yellow jersey in Grenoble.

==Rules==
The Tour de France, and other bicycle stage races, are decided by totalling the time each rider takes on the daily stages. Time can be added or subtracted from this total time as bonuses for winning individual stages or being first to the top of a climb or penalties for rule infractions. The rider with the lowest overall time at the end of each stage receives a ceremonial yellow jersey and the right to start the next stage of the Tour in the yellow jersey. The rider to receive the yellow jersey after the last stage in Paris is the overall winner of the Tour.

Similar leader&#x27;s jerseys exist in other cycling races, but are not always yellow. The Tour of California used gold, the Giro d&#x27;Italia uses pink and the Tour Down Under uses an ochre-coloured jersey. Until 2009 the Vuelta a España used gold; since 2010 the leader&#x27;s jersey is red.

==Exceptions==
===More than one rider leading the general classification===
In the early years of the Tour de France the time was measured in minutes although cyclists were usually seconds apart, which meant several cyclists sometimes shared the same time. In 1914 this happened with the two leaders Philippe Thys and Jean Rossius.

After the introduction of the yellow jersey in 1919, the general classification leaders shared the same time twice. First in 1929 three riders had the same time when the race reached Bordeaux. Nicolas Frantz of Luxembourg and the Frenchmen Victor Fontan and André Leducq all rode in yellow for Stage 18.
In 1931, Charles Pélissier and Rafaele di Paco led with the same time for Stage 6.

The organisers solved the problem of joint leaders by awarding the jersey to whichever rider had the best daily finishing places earlier in the race. The introduction of a short time trial at the start of the race in 1967 created distinctions down to a fraction of the second between riders&#x27; overall times, except for races which did not start with a time-trial, such as the 2008, 2011, 2013, and 2024 editions. According to the ASO rules,
:&quot;In the event of a tie in the general ranking, the hundredth of a second recorded by the timekeepers during the individual time trial stages will be included in the total times in order to decide the overall winner and who takes the yellow jersey. If a tie should still result from this, then the places achieved for each stage are added up and, as a last resort, the place obtained in the final stage is counted.&quot;

===No riders in yellow===
Multiple riders who became race leader through the misfortune of others have ridden next day without the yellow jersey.
* In 1950, Ferdi Kubler of Switzerland rode in his national jersey rather than yellow when the race leader, Fiorenzo Magni abandoned the race along with the Italian team in protest at threats said to have been made by spectators.
* In 1971, Eddy Merckx declined the jersey after the previous leader, Luis Ocaña, crashed on the col de Mente in the Pyrenees.
* In 1980, Joop Zoetemelk did not wear the yellow jersey that passed to him when his rival, Bernard Hinault, retired with tendonitis.
* In 1991, Greg LeMond rode without the jersey after a crash eliminated Rolf Sørensen.
* In 2005, Lance Armstrong refused to start in the yellow jersey after the previous owner, David Zabriskie, was eliminated by a crash, but put it on after the neutral zone on request of the race organizers.
* In 2015, there was no yellow jersey in Stage 7 after Tony Martin crashed in the previous stage. Martin had finished the previous stage after the crash (and officially retained the yellow jersey as a result), but had broken his collarbone in the crash and did not start Stage 7. Chris Froome became the overall leader with Martin&#x27;s non-start.

In 2007, there was neither a yellow jersey at the start of the race nor a number 1; the winner from the previous year, Floyd Landis of the United States, failed a doping control after the race, and organisers declined to declare an official winner pending arbitration of the Landis case. On September 20, 2007, Landis was officially stripped of his title following the arbitration court&#x27;s guilty verdict, and the 2006 title passed to Óscar Pereiro. In 2008, the runner-up from the previous year, Cadel Evans, was given the race number &quot;1&quot; when the 2007 winner, Alberto Contador was unable to defend his title due to a dispute between the organisers ASO and his new team Astana barring that team from riding the Tour.

===Doping violations===
In 1978, the Belgian rider Michel Pollentier became race leader after attacking on the Alpe d&#x27;Huez. He was disqualified the same day after trying to cheat a drug test.

In 1988, Pedro Delgado of Spain won the Tour despite a drug test showing he had taken a drug that could be used to hide the use of steroids. News of the test was leaked to the press by the former organiser of the Tour Jacques Goddet. Delgado was allowed to continue because the drug, probenecid, was not banned by the Union Cycliste Internationale.

The 1996 winner Bjarne Riis revealed in 2007 that he used drugs during the 1996 race. He was asked to stay away from the 2007 Tour in his role as directeur sportif of the Danish Team CSC.

The 2006 winner Floyd Landis was disqualified more than a year after the race. After he failed a doping control test following his stunning Stage 17 victory, an arbitration panel declared him guilty of doping in September 2007; the official title for the 2006 Tour passed to Óscar Pereiro. Landis appealed his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but lost this appeal at the end of June 2008 allowing Óscar Pereiro to start the 2008 edition of Le Tour de France as the unqualified 2006 Tour champion.

In 2007, the Danish rider Michael Rasmussen was withdrawn from the race by his team after complaints that he had not made himself available for drug tests earlier in the year. Rasmussen said that he was in Mexico, but there were reports that he was seen training in Italy. He later admitted doping for more than a decade.

Maurice Garin won the Tour de France before yellow jerseys were awarded; but in 1904, he was disqualified as winner after complaints that he and other riders cheated. The allegations disappeared with the Tour de France&#x27;s other archives, when they were taken south in 1940 to avoid the German invasion. But a man, who knew Garin as a small boy, recalled that Garin admitted catching a train part of the way.

In 2012, Lance Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles by UCI, following a report by the United States Anti-Doping Agency revealing that Armstrong had systematically used performance-enhancing drugs for much of his career, including all seven Tour victories.

==Record days in yellow==
The rider who has most worn the yellow jersey is the Belgian Eddy Merckx, who wore it 96 days. Only four other riders have worn it more than 50 days: Bernard Hinault, Miguel Induráin, Chris Froome and Jacques Anquetil. Until his records were revoked in 2012 due to disqualification by reason of doping, Lance Armstrong was in 2nd with 83.

Greg LeMond won the tour three times, Laurent Fignon won it twice and Joop Zoetemelk won it once, each of them have spent 22 days in the race lead.

Among active riders Froome is in the lead with 59, Jonas Vingegaard has 27, Tadej Pogačar 30, Julian Alaphilippe, 18 and Geraint Thomas, 15.

The rider to wear the Jersey in the most tours is Hinault with 8, which was every Tour he entered. Merckx, André Darrigade and Fabian Cancellara wore it in 6 and Indurain, Anquetil and Zoetemelk wore it in 5 Tours.

The greatest number of riders to wear the jersey in a single edition of Le Tour de France is eight, which happened in 1958 and 1987.

==Refusal of synthetic materials==
The yellow jersey was made for decades, like all other cycling jerseys, from wool. No synthetic fibres existed which had both the warmth and the absorption of wool. Embroidery was expensive and so the only lettering to appear on the jersey was the H.D. of Desgrange&#x27;s initials. Riders added the name of the team for which they were riding or the professional team for which they normally rode (in the years when the Tour was for national rather than sponsored teams) by attaching a panel of printed cloth to the front of the jersey by pins.

While synthetic material did not exist in a way to create whole jerseys, synthetic thread or blends were added in 1947, following the arrival of Sofil as a sponsor. Sofil made artificial yarn. Riders, especially the Frenchman Louison Bobet (Louis Bobet as he was still known), believed in the pureness of wool. Bobet insisted that cyclists needed wool for their long days of sweating in the heat and dust. It was a matter of hygiene. Artificial fabrics made riders sweat too much. And, in his first Tour de France, he refused to wear the jersey with which he had been presented.

Goddet recalled:

:&quot;It produced a real drama. Our contract with Sofil was crumbling away. If the news had got out, the commercial effect would have been disastrous for the manufacturer. I remember debating it with him a good part of the night. Louison was always exquisitely courteous but his principles were as hard as the granite blocks of his native Brittany coast.&quot;

==&quot;Elegance in yellow&quot;==
For the veteran writer and television broadcaster Jean-Paul Ollivier, the woollen yellow jersey...

:&quot;...gave the riders a rare elegance, even if the way it caught the air left something to be desired. In wool, then in Rhovyl — a material used for making underwear — it entered into legend for the quality of those who wore it. Those were the years of national teams. In 1930 Henri Desgrange, the organiser, decided that commercially-sponsored teams were contriving to spoil his race and opted instead for teams representing countries. The Tour de France stayed that way until 1962, when it reverted to commercial teams with the exception of 1967 and 1968 and the riders knotted on their jerseys a spare tyre [across the shoulders] A narrow slip of white cotton placed on the chest showed discreetly the name of the sponsor outside the Tour: La Perle, Mercier, Helyett...&quot;

The advent of printing by flocking, a process in which cotton fluff is sprayed on to stencilled glue, and then of screen printing, combined with the domination of synthetic materials to increase the advertising on jerseys: the domination which Ollivier regrets. &quot;All sorts of fantasies such as fluorescent jerseys or shorts&quot;, he said. Such was the quantity of advertising when Bernard Thévenet accepted the yellow jersey when the Tour finished for the first time on the Champs-Élysées in 1975 that the French sports minister counted all the logos and protested to broadcasters. Since then the number of people with access to the podium has been restricted.

==Sponsorship==
The French bank Crédit Lyonnais has sponsored the &quot;maillot jaune&quot; since 1987. The company has been a commercial partner of the Tour since 1981. It awards a toy lion - &quot;le lion en peluche&quot; - to each day&#x27;s winner as a play on its name. In 2007, sponsorship of the jersey was credited to LCL, the new name for Crédit Lyonnais following its takeover by another bank, Crédit Agricole.

The jersey has been produced by a variety of manufacturers – Nike from 1996 to 2011, Le Coq Sportif from 2012 to 2021 and Santini from 2022.

<text>The Agadir Crisis, Agadir Incident, or Second Moroccan Crisis was a brief crisis sparked by the deployment of a substantial force of French troops in the interior of Morocco in July 1911 and the deployment of the German gunboat to Agadir, a Moroccan Atlantic port. Germany did not object to France&#x27;s expansion but demanded “territorial compensation” for itself. Berlin threatened warfare, sent a gunboat and stirred up German nationalists. Negotiations between Berlin and Paris resolved the crisis on 4 November 1911: France took over Morocco as a protectorate in exchange for territorial concessions to German Cameroon from the French Congo.

In Britain, David Lloyd George, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, made a dramatic &quot;Mansion House&quot; speech on 21 July 1911 – with the consent of prime minister H. H. Asquith and Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey, bypassing the non-interventionist majority in the Cabinet – that denounced the German move as an intolerable humiliation. There was talk of war and Germany backed down; relations between Berlin and London worsened and the British moved closer to France. Berlin felt humiliated and began to dimly realize that it was operating with few allies and antagonizing multiple potential adversaries.

==Background==
France&#x27;s pre-eminence in Morocco had been upheld by the 1906 Algeciras Conference, following the First Moroccan Crisis of 1905–06. France and Germany agreed on 9 February 1909 that while France would have exclusive political control, the two nations would uphold each other&#x27;s economic interests in Morocco. In 1911 they forced the sultan to sign a new treaty wherein he promised not to sign any other treaties without French approval, arguably violating the earlier made agreements.

Germany&#x27;s move was aimed at testing the relationship between Britain and France, and possibly intimidating Britain into an alliance with Germany. Germany was also enforcing compensation claims for acceptance of effective French control of Morocco.

==Events==

===Moroccan Rebellion===
In 1911, a rebellion broke out in Morocco against Sultan Abd al-Hafid. The Frenchafter forcing the Sultan to request their assistanceprepared to send troops to help put down the rebellion under the pretext of protecting European lives and property in Fèz. Actual danger to European communities was remote: the rebellion broke out deep in the interior. They dispatched a flying column at the end of April. On 5 June, the Spanish deployed troops to occupy Larache and Ksar el-Kebir, fearing a French annexation of the country.

===German naval intervention===
Joseph Caillaux, then French minister for Finance, assured German diplomats in May 1911 that &#x27;France would be prepared, if the Germans recognized its vital interest in Morocco, to make concessions elsewhere&#x27;. On 20 June, France agreed to start negotiations. After ten days, they still had not responded. It was then that Kiderlen-Waechter, the German Foreign Minister, asked Kaiser Wilhelm II for permission to send a gunboat, having rejected the need to send two ships out of belief that the French would be quickly willing to negotiate.

On 1 July, the German gunboat arrived at the port of Agadir, under the pretext of protecting German trade interests. The larger came days later, replacing the gunboat. A German civilian, Hermann Wilberg, to the north, was sent south to Agadir to provide a pretext for the arrival of the &quot;Panther&quot;, but he only reached Agadir three days after the ship had arrived. There was an immediate reaction from the French and the British.

===German financial crisis===
In the midst of this crisis, Germany was hit by financial turmoil. The stock market plunged by 30 per cent in a single day, the public started cashing in currency notes for gold, and there was a run on the banks. The Reichsbank lost a fifth of its gold reserves in one month. It was rumoured that the French finance minister had orchestrated this crisis. Faced with the possibility of being driven off the gold standard, the Kaiser backed down and let the French take over most of Morocco.

===Negotiations===
On 7 July, the German ambassador in Paris informed the French government that Germany had no territorial aspirations in Morocco, and would negotiate for a French protectorate on the basis of &quot;compensation&quot; for Germany in the French Congo region and the safeguarding of her economic interests in Morocco. The German terms, as presented on 15 July, while containing an offer to cede the northern part of Kamerun and Togoland, demanded from France the whole of the French Congo from the Sangha River to the sea, to which was later added the transfer of France&#x27;s right to the preemption of the Belgian Congo.

On 21 July, David Lloyd George delivered a speech at the Mansion House, London in which he declared that national honour was more precious than peace: &quot;If Britain is treated badly where her interests are vitally affected, as if she is of no account in the cabinet of nations, then I say emphatically that peace at that price would be a humiliation intolerable for a great country like ours to endure.&quot; The speech was interpreted by Germany as a warning that she could not impose an unreasonable settlement on France.

On 4 November, secret Franco-German negotiations between Caillaux and the Germans led to a convention referred to as the Franco-German Accord, under which Germany accepted France&#x27;s position in Morocco in return for territory in the French Equatorial African colony of Middle Congo (now the Republic of the Congo), as outlined in the Morocco-Congo Treaty. This territory, known as Neukamerun, became part of the German colony of Kamerun. The area is partly marshland (where sleeping sickness was widespread) but gave Germany an outlet on the Congo River. Germany ceded to the French colony of Tchad a small area of territory to the southeast of Fort Lamy (now part of Chad).

French premier Caillaux&#x27;s negotiations with the Germans were leaked, causing him to fall from office on 21 January 1912, after a term of only seven months. In Germany, the Franco-German accord was also criticised – especially by the nationalist press – for giving Germany too little.

===British involvement===
The initial reaction in London was cautious: the Liberal government in Cabinet felt that France was largely responsible for triggering the crisis and ought therefore be urged to give ground. The British government attempted to restrain France from adopting hasty measures and to dissuade her from sending troops. In April, the Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey wrote: &quot;what the French contemplate doing is not wise, but we cannot under our agreement interfere&quot;. When Cabinet authorised Grey to inform the French that Britain might accept a German presence in Morocco on 19 July, the French government replied angrily that any such acceptance would breach the 1904 Anglo-French Agreement.

The prospect of a German naval port on the Atlantic, however, allowed Grey to secure Cabinet&#x27;s approval on 21 July to inform the German ambassador that Britain would respond forcefully to defend its interests. Britain sent battleships to Morocco, in case war broke out. As in the First Moroccan Crisis, British support of France showed the strength of the Entente Cordiale.

Divisions, however, became clear between the supporters of the entente (Grey, Lloyd George, and Asquith especially) and the non-interventionists (who made up a majority of the Cabinet). Lloyd George delivered the Mansion House speech on 21 July 1911, bypassing the Liberal non-interventionists in Cabinet. Viscount Morley, secretary of state for India, denounced the speech as an &#x27;unwarranted and unfortunate provocation to Germany&#x27;; Lord Loreburn, the Lord Chancellor, entreated Grey to take a non-interventionist stance and disavow the speech. Later in the year, there was a backbench revolt against Grey, which was unsuccessful.

==Aftermath==
One consequence of the crisis was that the French viewed German policy as motivated by bluff: Raymond Poincaré, the premier succeeding Caillaux in early 1912, observed that &#x27;whenever we have adopted a conciliatory approach to Germany... she has abused it; on the other hand, on each occasion when we have shown firmness, she has yielded&#x27;, drawing the conclusion that Berlin would only understand a forceful response. Kissinger labels the risk-taking in this crisis used to appease the nationalism-inclined journalists and agitated public while disregarding the true interests at stake elsewhere as &quot;strategic frivolity&quot;.
American historian Raymond James Sontag argued in 1933 that it was a comedy of errors that became a tragic prelude to the First World War:
:The crisis seems comic – its obscure origin, the questions at stake, the conduct of the actors – indeed was comic. But the results were tragic. Tensions between France and Germany and between Germany and England have been increased; the armaments race received new impetus; the conviction that an early war was inevitable spread through the governing class of Europe.

With Abd al-Hafid&#x27;s capitulation and signing of the Treaty of Fes (30 March 1912), France established a full protectorate over Morocco, ending what remained of that country&#x27;s formal independence. British backing of France during the crisis reinforced the Entente between the two countries (and with Russia as well), increasing Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions which would culminate in the First World War.

This incident led Britain&#x27;s Home Secretary Winston Churchill to conclude the Royal Navy must convert its power source from coal to oil, to preserve its supremacy. Until then, the locally abundant coal was favoured over imported oil (mostly from Persia), but the speed and efficiency offered by oil convinced him that &quot;Mastery itself was the prize of the venture.&quot; Subsequently, Churchill was asked by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith to become First Lord of the Admiralty, which he accepted.

The crisis led Britain and France to conclude a secret naval agreement by which the Royal Navy promised to protect the northern coast of France from German Navy attack, while France concentrated her fleet in the western Mediterranean and agreed to defend British interests there. France was thus able to guard her communications with her North African colonies, and Britain to concentrate more force in home waters to oppose the German High Seas Fleet. Britain also formed a Railway Executive Committee in order to rapidly mobilize in the event of a continental war.

German world historian Oswald Spengler was inspired by the episode to write his &quot;The Decline of the West&quot;. &quot;The Agadir crisis of 1911, which suddenly raised the spectre of a general European war and strikingly revealed the danger of Germany&#x27;s encirclement by the Entente, crystallized Spengler&#x27;s nascent vision of the future international political transformation of the West.&quot;

During the First World War, in 1916, Neukamerun returned to France. The territory today forms part of Chad, Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, and Gabon. Established in 1912, the French protectorate in Morocco lasted until 1956.

<doc id="277784" wikidata="Q806460" url="?curid=277784" title="Bangalore torpedo">
<text>A Bangalore torpedo is an explosive charge placed within one or several connected tubes. It is used by combat engineers to clear obstacles that would otherwise require them to approach directly, possibly under fire. It is sometimes colloquially referred to as a &quot;Bangalore mine&quot;, &quot;banger&quot; or simply &quot;Bangalore&quot; as well as a pole charge.
Per United States Army Field Manual 5-250 section 1–14, page 1–12 &quot;b. Use. The primary use of the torpedo is clearing paths through wire obstacles and heavy undergrowth. It will clear a 3- to 4-metre wide path through wire obstacles.&quot;

== Overview ==
The Bangalore torpedo was devised by Captain R. L. McClintock of the Royal Engineers while attached to the Madras Sappers and Miners unit of the Indian Army at Bangalore, India, in 1912. He invented it as a means of blowing up booby traps and barricades left over from the Second Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War. The Bangalore torpedo could be exploded over a mine, without a sapper having to approach closer than about .

Bangalore torpedoes were manufactured until 2017 by Mondial Defence Systems of Poole, UK, for the UK and US armed forces. An improved version called the Advanced Performance Bangalore Torpedo (APBT) was developed by Chemring Energetics UK, part of the Chemring Group, in response to a British Ministry of Defence (MOD) requirement issued in 2008. The APBT was chosen by the MOD following competitive performance trials and is used by the militaries of Australia, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. They were used during the Afghanistan War for actions such as clearing mines or razor wire.

== In World War I ==
In World War I the Bangalore torpedo was primarily used for clearing barbed wire before an attack. It could be used while under fire, from a protected position in a trench. The torpedo was standardized to consist of a number of externally identical lengths of threaded pipe, one of which contained the explosive charge. The pipes would be screwed together using connecting sleeves to make a longer pipe of the required length, somewhat like a chimney brush or drain clearing rod.

A smooth nose cone was screwed on the end to prevent snagging on the ground. It was pushed forward from a protected position and detonated, to clear a wide hole through barbed wire. During the 1917 Battle of Cambrai, British Royal Engineers used them as diversions to distract the enemy from where the real battle was to be fought.

== In World War II ==
The Bangalore torpedo was used in the British offensive on Bardia during the Western Desert Campaign, on 3 January 1941.

The Bangalore torpedo was later adopted by the U.S. Army during World War II, as the &quot;M1A1 Bangalore torpedo&quot;. Bangalore torpedoes were packed in wooden crates that contained 10 torpedo sections, 10 connecting sleeves, and 1 nose sleeve. The total weight of a crate was . Each torpedo section was long, in diameter, and weighed . 

Each end of the torpedo was filled with of TNT booster, while the middle section contained an 80–20 amatol mixture. The explosive charge weighed about . Each end of the torpedo had a recess to accommodate a standard Corps of Engineers blasting cap. Torpedo sections could be attached together via spring clip-equipped connecting sleeves. A blunt nose sleeve was provided so that the assembled torpedoes could be pushed through obstacles or across terrain without getting stuck.

It was widely used by the U.S. Army, notably during the D-Day landings. The Bangalore torpedo was obsolete in British use at the time of D-Day, having been replaced by rocket-launched Congers and Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE) vehicles equipped with a explosive charge for bunker clearing.

== Post–World War II development ==


The U.S. Army and the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam used the Bangalore torpedo during the Vietnam War.

During the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Bangalore torpedoes were used by the Israelis to clear paths through Syrian minefields.

Bangalore torpedoes continue to be used today in the little-changed M1A2 and M1A3 versions of the United States Armed Forces, and the modified Advanced Performance Bangalore Torpedo version of the British Armed Forces and Australian Defence Force, under the L26A1 designation which is also used by Chemring, primarily to breach wire obstacles. 

Combat engineers have been known to construct similar field versions of the Bangalore by assembling segments of metal picket posts and filling the concave portion with plastic explosive (PE). The PE is then primed with detonating cord and a detonator, and pickets are taped or wired together to make a long torpedo, producing fragments (aka &quot;shrapnel&quot;) that cut the wire when detonated. This method produces results similar to the standard-issue Bangalore, and can be assembled to the desired length by adding picket segments.

Newer Bangalore variants include the Alford Technologies Bangalore Blade and the Chemring Advanced Performance Bangalore Torpedo (APBT), with both developed in the United Kingdom. The Bangalore Blade is made from lightweight aluminium and is configured as a linear explosively formed projectile (EFP) array capable of cutting wire obstacles, which earlier Bangalore variants were incapable of breaching effectively. The improvements introduced with the Bangalore Blade give the charge a cutting action as well as a blasting effect. 

In a test detonation conducted on the television show &quot;Future Weapons&quot;, the Bangalore Blade blasted a gap roughly five meters wide in concertina wire, and created a trench deep enough to detonate most nearby anti-personnel mines. Alford Technologies&#x27; web page for the Bangalore Blade cites additional trial detonations involving two identical triple-razor wire entanglements erected between steel pickets. A Bangalore torpedo conforming to the original design cleared a three-metre path, while the Bangalore Blade cleared a ten-metre path. 

The Advanced Performance Bangalore Torpedo uses an aluminium body and is filled with two kilograms of DPX1 high density pressed explosive. A unique and patented design feature is incorporated which, in combination with the DPX1 explosive, provides enhanced blast and fragmentation effects which provide an enhanced cutting capability against both simple and complex wire entanglements. The APBT is capable of cutting through up to six millimetres of steel plating.

Up to eight APBTs can be combined with one another, with the resulting assembly capable of defeating obstacles that are up to eight metres in length. The quick-turn thread used for this purpose has been designed for ease of assembly when contaminated with sand, soil, or mud while being strong enough to ensure reliable deployment of connected charges without inadvertent decoupling. The APBT has an improved Insensitive Munition signature compared to preceding in-service designs.

== Other recent path-clearing devices ==
The U.S. Anti-Personnel Obstacle Breaching System (APOBS) is being brought into service as a replacement to the Bangalore for path-clearing due to its ease of use, effectiveness, and flexibility – it can clear a path several times longer than the Bangalore torpedo.

<doc id="277787" wikidata="Q2472023" url="?curid=277787" title="The Newgate Calendar">
<text>The Newgate Calendar, subtitled &quot;The Malefactors&#x27; Bloody Register&quot;, was a popular collection of moralising stories about sin, crime, and criminals who commit them in England in the 18th and 19th centuries. Originally a monthly of executions, produced by the Keeper of Newgate Prison in London, the Calendar&#x27;s title was appropriated by other publishers, who put out biographical chapbooks about notorious criminals such as Sawney Bean, Dick Turpin, and Moll Cutpurse.

== Overview ==

Collected editions of these stories began to appear in the mid-18th century, and in 1774 a five-volume bound edition became the standard version. While many of its accounts are highly embellished and/or drawn uncritically from other sources, they are lively and full of incident, and often refer to contemporary events and social issues. Along with the Bible and John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, the &quot;Calendar&quot; was famously in the top three works most likely to be found in the average home. 

The entries editorialise strongly against their subjects, including Catholicism, The Protectorate and Commonwealth, any political enemies of Britain (such as the French), drunkenness, prostitution (&quot;Women of abandoned character&quot;), gambling, &quot;dissipation&quot; in general and other &quot;vices&quot;, while eulogising Protestantism, the Church of England, the English monarchy and legal system, the Common Law and Bloody Code, with some rare exceptions. One edition contained an introduction suggesting that swindling be made (another) capital offence.

A new edition in four volumes was published in 1824-26 by Andrew Knapp and William Baldwin, two lawyers, and a further edition in 1826, under the title, &quot;The New Newgate Calendar&quot;.

A penny dreadful edition of The New Newgate Calendar appeared between 1863 and 1866.

==Influence and legacy==
&quot;The Newgate Calendar&quot; had a lasting legacy on early 19th-century crime fiction. Critics believed that the &quot;Calendars&quot;&#x27; publication would inspire copycat criminals and romanticize crime culture.

There was a communal and social element to the stories. According to Henry Mayhew, orphans in common lodging-houses would read the stories out loud in groups.

Spoofs were dubbed &quot;Newgate novels&quot; of the &quot;Newgate school&quot; of literature in a derogatory manner. &quot;Oliver Twist,&quot; which mentions the &quot;Calendar&quot; twice, was designated as such by Dickens&#x27; contemporary, William Makepeace Thackeray, much to Dickens&#x27; chagrin.

Tom Cringle in Michael Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Tom Cringle&#x27;s Log&quot; apologises for interrupting the pirate smuggler Obed&#x27;s confessional story, saying &quot;It was not quite the thing to cut you short in the middle of your Newgate Calendar, Obed--beg pardon, your story I mean; no offence now, none in the world--eh?&quot;

Thomas Carlyle wrote, in his &quot;Life of Friedrich Schiller&quot;: &quot;Look at the biography of authors! Except the Newgate Calendar, it is the most sickening chapter in the history of man.&quot;

<doc id="277790" wikidata="Q5623451" url="?curid=277790" title="Gwen Shamblin Lara">
<text>Gwendolyn Henley Shamblin Lara (February 18, 1955 – May 29, 2021) was the founder of the Remnant Fellowship Church, founder of the Christian diet program &quot;The Weigh Down Workshop,&quot; and an American author.

She is the subject of the 2021 HBO Max docuseries, &quot;The Way Down: God, Greed, and the Cult of Gwen Shamblin&quot;. 

==Early life==
Lara earned an undergraduate degree in dietetics and a master&#x27;s degree in food and nutrition with an emphasis in biochemistry from University of Tennessee, in Knoxville. She was a registered dietitian, consultant and a faculty member at Memphis State University for five years. She also worked in the city&#x27;s Tennessee Department of Health for five years. 

Lara was raised in a Church of Christ family. 

She had two children and seven grandchildren.

== Career and ministry ==

===Weigh Down Workshop===
Lara began a weight control consulting practice in 1980. She had struggled with her weight in college. She counseled that genetics, metabolism, and behavior modification did not explain why some people were thin while others were overweight. Lara founded the Weigh Down Workshop, a weight-loss program with no food restrictions, exercise regimens, weigh-ins, or calorie-counting in 1986.

Some experts expressed concern because the program eliminated exercise and guidance on food selection as recommended by the American Dietetic Association.

Lara developed Weigh Down Workshop while working on her master&#x27;s degree at Memphis State University. As part of a counseling center, Lara hosted the first class in a mall in Memphis, Tennessee. The program was offered as small classes in retail and non-religious settings. She began hosting the program at Bellevue Baptist Church near Memphis in the 1990s. The program consisted of 12-week seminars guided by video and audio tapes featuring Lara.

The program was offered in about 600 churches in 35 U.S. states by 1994. The program was in more than 1,000 churches in 49 states, Great Britain and Canada by January 1995. The program had grown to about 5,000 churches, with about 10 percent located in Lara&#x27;s home state of Tennessee, by July 1996. Approximately eight churches in Britain were hosting workshops in December 1996. Some participants in the U.S. hosted meetings in their homes.

In 1996, Weigh Down Workshop had a staff of 40 and built a headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee, and Lara began hosting an annual summer convention, Desert Oasis, in the Nashville area.

Weigh Down Workshop hosted more than 21,000 classes with more than 250,000 participants worldwide by August 1998. Classes were hosted in every U.S. state and in Canada and Europe.

Lara was criticized for using the Christianity label while building her business. In 2001, Nashville CBS affiliate WTVF investigated how Weigh Down Workshop leaders spent money. Lara said half the proceeds from Weigh Down Workshop were paid as taxes and the other half were put back into the program.

=== Remnant Fellowship Church ===
Shamblin founded the Remnant Fellowship Church in Franklin, Tennessee in 1999. The church&#x27;s building was completed in 2004 on 40 acres Lara purchased in Brentwood, Tennessee.

Shamblin had preached that members should give their money to the Remnant Fellowship church, the only true church, and that all other churches were fraudulent. Upon her death in 2021, it was found that Shamblin&#x27;s will left none of her multimillion-dollar fortune to the church. One reporter noted the irony of this, mentioning that less than four weeks before her death, Shamblin had made a video in which she warned others about greed:

=== Writings ===
Shamblin published &quot;The Weigh Down Diet&quot;, a book that advised readers to use spirituality to avoid overeating, in 1997. The book sold more than 1.2 million copies. The Weigh Down Diet teaches the love of food should be transferred to a love of God, and to cut food portions in half and eat only when hungry. Shamblin wrote multiple books after that.

Shamblin sent an email to her followers saying that she believed that the doctrine of the Trinity was not biblical on August 10, 2000. In response, some evangelical churches dropped her program, Thomas Nelson Publishers canceled the publication of her next book, she was removed from the Women of Faith website, and some employees left her staff.

== Accusations of abuse ==

A 2021 HBO Max 5-part docuseries &quot;The Way Down: God, Greed, and the Cult of Gwen Shamblin&quot; explores some of the accusations made against Gwen Shamblin Lara and Remnant Fellowship Church over the years. These accusations include claims that Lara promoted corporal punishment as a means for parents to keep their children obedient and submissive.

According to Michael Shamblin, Gwen&#x27;s son, &quot;People have been hurt, fallen by the wayside, have been victim to it. People have been financially hurt by it. It&#x27;s hard to call it a church, in my mind. It is a church, but it&#x27;s a cult.&quot;.

Joseph and Sonya Smith were adherents of Shamblin and had an eight-year-old son, Josef. Sonya and Joseph routinely disciplined Josef by beating him with foot-long glue sticks, belts, and heated coat hangers; locking him in confined spaces for extended periods of time; and tying his hands with rope. Sonya told police that she &quot;normally&quot; gave the children their whippings in increments of ten blows each, and that Josef had gotten several of those whipping sessions on the day of his death. The police reported that the Smiths locked Josef in his room to pray to a picture of Jesus on the ceiling and in a closet for days and even weeks. He was given only a bucket for a toilet. An older son sometimes held Josef down while the parents beat him with implements.

During the day on October 8, 2003, Joseph beat Josef several times, striking him repeatedly with a glue stick. County medical examiners concluded that eight-year-old Josef Smith died as a result of &quot;acute and chronic&quot; abuse. Members of the Remnant Church led by Shamblin paid for the legal defense of the Smiths. They were convicted in &quot;Georgia v. Smith&quot;. The Smiths were sentenced on March 27, 2007, to life plus 30 years in prison (the maximum punishment) by Cobb County Superior Court Judge James Bodiford. Another child in the family, Milek Smith, had died 11 weeks before Josef&#x27;s death, with the cause of death being variously reported as either pneumonia or SIDS.

==2023 TV film &quot;Gwen Shamblin: Starving for Salvation&quot;==
In 2023, a Lifetime TV film directed by John L&#x27;Ecuyer written by Richard Blaney and Gregory Small was released with Shamblin portrayed by Jennifer Grey and starring Vincent Walsh and Alain Goulem.

==Personal life==
In 1978 she married David Shamblin, with whom she would have two children. In 2018 Shamblin filed for divorce and married Joe Lara.

Lara lived with her husband in Ashlawn, a historic mansion in Brentwood, Tennessee that was built in 1838.

==Death==
Gwen Lara was killed together with her husband Joe, her son-in-law Brandon Hannah, and two other couples from the Remnant Fellowship Church when the Laras&#x27; 1982 Cessna Citation 501 private jet crashed into Percy Priest Lake near Smyrna, Tennessee, shortly after takeoff on May 29, 2021.

The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the crash was a result of pilot Joe Lara&#x27;s &quot;loss of airplane control during climb due to spatial disorientation.&quot;

<doc id="277795" wikidata="Q298276" url="?curid=277795" title="Michael Sheen">
<text>Sir Michael Christopher Sheen (born 5 February 1969) is a Welsh actor. After training at London&#x27;s Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), he worked mainly in theatre throughout the 1990s with stage roles in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1992), &quot;Don&#x27;t Fool with Love&quot; (1993), &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; (1994), &quot;The Seagull&quot; (1995), &quot;The Homecoming&quot; (1997), and &quot;Henry V&quot; (1997). He received Olivier Awards nominations for his performances in &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1998) at the Old Vic, &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1999) at the National Theatre and &quot;Caligula&quot; (2003) at the Donmar Warehouse.

Early this century Sheen began screen acting, focusing on biographical films. For writer Peter Morgan, he starred in a trilogy of films as British prime minister Tony Blairthe television film &quot;The Deal&quot; in 2003, &quot;The Queen&quot; (2006), and &quot;The Special Relationship&quot; (2010)earning him nominations for both a BAFTA Award and an Emmy. He was also nominated for a BAFTA as the troubled comic actor Kenneth Williams in BBC Four&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Fantabulosa!&quot;, and was nominated for a fourth Olivier Award in 2006 for portraying the broadcaster David Frost in &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot;, a role he revisited in the 2008 film adaptation of the play. He starred as the controversial football manager Brian Clough in &quot;The Damned United&quot; (2009).

Since 2009 Sheen has had a wider variety of roles. In 2009, he appeared in two fantasy films, &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Saga: New Moon&quot;, and in 2010, he made a four-episode guest appearance in the NBC comedy &quot;30 Rock&quot;. He appeared in the science-fiction film &quot;&quot; (2010) and Woody Allen&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; (2011). He directed and starred in National Theatre Wales&#x27;s &quot;The Passion&quot;. From late 2011 until early 2012, he played the title role in &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Young Vic. He played a lead role in &quot;The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2&quot; in 2012. In 2013, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his role in Showtime&#x27;s television drama &quot;Masters of Sex&quot;.

Sheen played an incarcerated serial killer surgeon in Fox&#x27;s drama series &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; (2019–2021), Aziraphale in the BBC/Amazon Studios fantasy comedy series &quot;Good Omens&quot; (2019–present), and appeared as Chris Tarrant in &quot;Quiz&quot; (2020). He played himself in the quarantine comedy show &quot;Staged&quot; (2020–2022) with his friend and &quot;Good Omens&quot; co-star David Tennant throughout the COVID-19 lockdown. Sheen is politically engaged, and in 2017 he renounced being an OBE after conducting research on Wales&#x27;s relationship with England.

==Early life==
Sheen was born on 5 February 1969 in Newport, Monmouthshire, Wales, the son of Irene, a secretary, and Meyrick, a British Steel Corporation personnel manager. He has one younger sister, Joanne. The family had already been living in Llanmartin for seven years prior to his birth. When he was five, the family moved to Wallasey for work, but settled in his parents&#x27; home town of Port Talbot, Glamorgan, three years later.

Director Sam Mendes has described Sheen as &quot;a stage creature&quot; and attributed that to the actor&#x27;s Welsh roots: &quot;I&#x27;m serious. He&#x27;s Welsh in the tradition of Anthony Hopkins and Richard Burton: fiery, mercurial, unpredictable.&quot; A keen footballer, Sheen was scouted and offered a place on Arsenal&#x27;s youth team at the age of 12, but his family was unwilling to relocate to London. He later said he was &quot;grateful&quot; for his parents&#x27; decision, as the chances of forging a professional football career were &quot;so slim&quot;.

Sheen was raised in a theatrical family; his parents were both involved in local amateur operatics and musicals and, later in life, his father worked as a part-time professional Jack Nicholson lookalike. In his teenage years, Sheen was involved with the West Glamorgan Youth Theatre and, later, the National Youth Theatre of Wales. &quot;It was a brilliant youth theatre&quot;, Sheen has said, &quot;and it taught me not only a lot about acting, but also about work ethic; it was very disciplined.&quot; He was influenced by the performances of Laurence Olivier and the writings of theatre critic Kenneth Tynan, saying &quot;the combination of those two things kind of blew my head off.&quot; Sheen was educated at Blaenbaglan Primary School, Glan Afan Comprehensive School and, finally, Neath Port Talbot College where he sat A-levels in English, Drama and Sociology. He considered studying English at university but instead decided to attend drama school. He moved to London in 1988 to train as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), having spent the previous year working in a Welsh fast-food restaurant called Burger Master to earn money. Sheen was granted the Laurence Olivier Bursary by the Society of London Theatre in his second year at RADA. He graduated in 1991 with a BA in Acting.

==Career==

===Classical stage roles (1991–2001)===
Sheen worked predominantly in theatre in the 1990s and has since remarked that he will always feel &quot;slightly more at home&quot; on stage. &quot;It&#x27;s more of an actor&#x27;s medium. You are your own editor, nobody else is choosing what is being seen of you.&quot; His first professional role, while still in his third and final year at RADA, was in &quot;When She Danced&quot; at the Globe Theatre in 1991. He later described the role as &quot;a big break. One day, I was at RADA doing a movement class, the next I was at a read-through with Vanessa Redgrave and Frances de la Tour.&quot; Milton Shulman of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; praised an &quot;excellent&quot; performance while &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote of &quot;a notable West End debut&quot;. In 1992, Sheen&#x27;s performance in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Royal Exchange received a MEN Theatre Award nomination and led theatre critic Michael Coveney to declare him &quot;the most exciting young actor of his generation ... a volatile, electrifying and technically fearless performer&quot;. His 1993 turn as Perdican in Alfred de Musset&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Fool With Love&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse was nominated for the Ian Charleson Award. and was described by &quot;The Independent&quot; as &quot;quite thrilling&quot;. Also in 1993, Sheen appeared in the world premiere of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight&quot; at the Almeida Theatre and made his television debut in the 1993 BBC mini-series &quot;Gallowglass&quot;.

Sheen played the title role in &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; in 1994. The Yukio Ninagawa production was staged in Oslo, Tokyo and at the Barbican Centre, London. &quot;The Times&quot; praised Sheen&#x27;s &quot;astonishing vitality&quot; while &quot;The Independent&quot; found him &quot;sensationally good&quot; and noted that &quot;the Norwegian press were grudgingly captivated by the mercurial Welsh boyo&quot;. In other 1994 work, Sheen appeared in &quot;Le Livre de Spencer&quot; at the Odéon-Théâtre de l&#x27;Europe, Paris and starred in the cross-dressing farce &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; at the Royal Exchange. In 1995, he appeared opposite Kate Beckinsale in a production of &quot;The Seagull&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Bath and, with the encouragement of Thelma Holt, directed and starred in &quot;The Dresser&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth. In addition, Sheen made his film debut that year, appearing opposite Kenneth Branagh in &quot;Othello&quot;. 1996 saw Sheen at the National Theatre for &quot;The Ends of the Earth&quot;, an original play by David Lan. A minor role in &quot;Mary Reilly&quot; marked the first of three film collaborations with director Stephen Frears. Sheen&#x27;s most significant appearance of 1997 was the title role in &quot;Henry V&quot;, staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) at their Stratford-upon-Avon theatre, which earned him a second Ian Charleson Award nomination. &quot;The Times&quot; praised &quot;a blisteringly intelligent performance&quot;. Also in 1997, he appeared in a revival of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Homecoming&quot; at the National Theatre, directed by Roger Michell, and directed &quot;Badfinger&quot;, starring Rhys Ifans, at the Donmar Warehouse. The latter was staged by the Thin Language Theatre Company, which Sheen had co-founded in 1991, aiming to further Welsh theatre. He then appeared in the biographical film &quot;Wilde&quot;, playing Robbie Ross to Stephen Fry&#x27;s Oscar Wilde. In early 1998 Sheen formed a production company, The Foundry, with Helen McCrory and Robert Delamere to promote the work of emerging playwrights, and produced &quot;A Little World of Our Own&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse, which gave Colin Farrell his West End debut.

From 1998 to 1999 Sheen starred as Mozart in a successful revival of &quot;Amadeus&quot;. The Peter Hall-directed production was staged at the Old Vic, London, and later transferred to the Music Box on Broadway. Ben Brantley, chief theatre critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was particularly vocal in his praise. He noted that &quot;Mr. Sheen elicits a real poetry from the role&quot; and felt that, while watching him, &quot;you start to appreciate the derivation of the term star. This actor is so luminous it&#x27;s scary!&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot; found him &quot;quite stunning as Mozart. His fantastically physical performance convinces you of his character&#x27;s genius and the play catches fire whenever he&#x27;s on stage.&quot; Sheen was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Supporting Performance and an Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actor. In 1999, Sheen explored the role of Jimmy Porter in the National Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;. In 2003, Sheen described the production as &quot;the most enjoyable thing I&#x27;ve ever done ... everything came together&quot;. &quot;Sheen has cornered the market in explosive energy&quot;, said &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;but this thrilling performance is his finest yet.&quot; The &quot;Financial Times&quot; noted: &quot;As Jimmy Porter, a role of staggering difficulty in every way, Michael Sheen gives surely the best performance London has yet seen from him ... You hang on every word he utters ... This is a dazzlingly through-the-body performance.&quot; He was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and an Evening Standard Award for Best Actor.

===&quot;The Deal&quot;, &quot;The Queen&quot;, and &quot;Fantabulosa&quot; (2002–2006)===
At this point in his career Sheen began to devote more time to film work. &quot;Heartlands&quot;, a little-seen 2002 film about a naive man&#x27;s road trip in the Midlands, was his first leading film role. While &quot;The Guardian&quot; dismissed the &quot;cloying bittersweet-regional-lottery-Britfilm&quot;, it noted that &quot;Sheen himself has a childlike, Frank Spencer-ish charm&quot;. &quot;It was great to do something that was so different&quot;, Sheen has said of the role. &quot;I usually play very extreme characters.&quot; Also in 2002, he had a minor role in the action-adventure film &quot;The Four Feathers&quot;. In 2003, Sheen appeared in &quot;Bright Young Things&quot;, the directorial debut of his &quot;Wilde&quot; co-star, Stephen Fry. An adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;Vile Bodies&quot;, the film followed high society partygoers in decadent, pre-war London. Sheen played a gay aristocrat in an ensemble cast which included James McAvoy, Emily Mortimer, David Tennant, Dan Aykroyd, Jim Broadbent and Peter O&#x27;Toole. While the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said he &quot;shone&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; felt the role &quot;drastically under-uses his talents&quot;. Sheen described his character as &quot;possibly the campest man in cinema history&quot; and relished a scene &quot;where I do drugs with [a then 95-year-old] Sir John Mills.&quot; In other 2003 film work, Sheen portrayed the werewolf leader Lucian in &quot;Underworld&quot; and made a brief appearance in the sci-fi film &quot;Timeline&quot;.

Sheen returned to the stage in 2003 to play the title role in &quot;Caligula&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse, directed by Michael Grandage. It was the first of just three stage appearances during the 2000s; his young daughter was now based in Los Angeles which made more frequent stage runs in Britain impractical. &quot;The Independent&quot;″s critic declared it &quot;one of the most thrilling and searching performances I have ever witnessed&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described him as an &quot;outrageously charismatic actor&quot; with &quot;an astonishing physical presence&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; praised a &quot;riveting performance&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; found him &quot;highly impressive ... at one point he attacks his court poet with a single hair-raising leap across a chair and table&quot;. Sheen won an Evening Standard Award for Best Actor and a Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Award for Best Actor, and was again nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor.

Sheen&#x27;s breakthrough role was as British politician Tony Blair in 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Deal&quot;. The Channel 4 film explored the so-called Granita pact made by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown prior to the 1994 Labour Party leadership election, and was the actor&#x27;s first collaboration with screenwriter Peter Morgan. Director Stephen Frears cast him because &quot;he was in &quot;Mary Reilly&quot; and I knew he was brilliant.&quot; Filmed while he was playing &quot;Caligula&quot; nightly on stage, Sheen has remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s interesting that in searching for monsters to play, you often end up playing leaders.&quot; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; praised his &quot;earnest, yet steely, portrayal&quot; while &quot;The Guardian&quot; found him &quot;excellent. This is intelligent and honest casting.&quot; In 2004, Sheen starred in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Filthy Love&quot;, a comic film about a man dealing with OCD and Tourette&#x27;s after a marital separation. Sheen spoke of &quot;treading a fine line&quot; because &quot;a lot of the symptoms are intrinsically comical&quot;. He was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Television Actor and a RTS Best Actor Award. Also in 2004, Sheen played a pompous rock star in the romantic comedy &quot;Laws of Attraction&quot; and produced and starred in &quot;The Banker&quot;, which won a BAFTA Award for Best Short Film. 

In 2005, Sheen starred in the National Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;The UN Inspector&quot;, a David Farr adaptation of &quot;The Government Inspector&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote of &quot;a scathingly brilliant and inventive performance&quot; while &quot;Variety&quot; noted that the actor &quot;adds comic finesse to his apparently ceaseless repertoire&quot;. &quot;The Evening Standard&quot;, while conceding that the performance was &quot;technically brilliant&quot;, expressed bemusement as to why &quot;one of the most mercurial and inspiring actors we have seems set on impersonating Rik Mayall throughout&quot;. Also that year, he took part in the Old Vic&#x27;s &quot;24 Hour Play&quot;, in which &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; felt he &quot;dazzled&quot;. In 2005 film work, Sheen starred in &quot;Dead Long Enough&quot;, a small-budget Welsh/Irish film, with his longtime friend, Jason Hughes. In addition, he had a supporting role in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, made a cameo appearance in &quot;The League of Gentlemen&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot; and starred in the short film &quot;The Open Doors&quot;.

Sheen came to international attention in 2006 for his portrayal of Tony Blair in &quot;The Queen&quot;. The film focused on the differing reactions of the British Royal Family and the newly appointed Prime Minister following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997; it was Sheen&#x27;s third collaboration with director Stephen Frears and his second with screenwriter Peter Morgan. He enjoyed reprising his role because Blair, at this point in his career, had &quot;a weight to him that he didn&#x27;t have before&quot;. When asked to discuss his personal opinion of Blair, Sheen admitted that the more time he spent working on the character, the &quot;less opinion&quot; he has of the politician: &quot;Now when I watch him on TV or hear his voice, it&#x27;s sort of like a cross between a family member, a friend and seeing a really old embarrassing video of yourself.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised &quot;a sensational performance, alert and nuanced&quot; while &quot;Empire&quot; spoke of an &quot;uncanny, insightful performance&quot;. Sheen was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. His second film appearance of 2006 was a supporting role in &quot;Blood Diamond&quot; as an unscrupulous diamond dealer. 

Also in 2006 Sheen starred as the troubled English comic actor Kenneth Williams in BBC Four&#x27;s &quot;Fantabulosa!&quot; In preparation for the role, he lost two and a half stone (approx. 35 lbs), studied archival footage and read Williams&#x27; published diaries. Sheen has said he is &quot;fascinated by finding the private side of the public face&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; found his performance &quot;mesmerising&quot; while &quot;The Observer&quot; described it as &quot;a characterisation for which the description tour-de-force is, frankly, pretty faint praise&quot;. He won a RTS Award for Best Actor, and received his second BAFTA nomination of 2006, for Best Television Actor. Sheen starred in two other BBC television productions in 2006, playing H. G. Wells in &quot;H. G. Wells: War with the World&quot; and Nero in &quot;Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire&quot;.

===&quot;Frost/Nixon&quot; and &quot;The Damned United&quot; (2007–2009)===
From 2006 to 2007, Sheen starred as the television broadcaster David Frost in &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot; at both the Donmar Warehouse and Gielgud Theatre in London and the Jacobs Theatre on Broadway. The play, written by Peter Morgan, directed by Michael Grandage and co-starring Frank Langella, was a critical and commercial success but Sheen initially accepted the role as a favour to his friends and &quot;never thought it was going anywhere&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the actor &quot;exactly captures Frost&#x27;s verbal tics and mannerisms while suggesting a nervousness behind the self-assurance&quot;. &quot;He&#x27;s got the voice, the mannerisms, the blaze,&quot; said the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;but, more than that, Sheen – as viscerally exciting an actor as any in Britain today – shows us the hunger of Frost&#x27;s ambition .. and fox-like instinct for the hunt and the kill.&quot; Sheen was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and a Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance. Sheen next appeared in the 2007 film &quot;Music Within&quot; as a political activist with cerebral palsy. He spoke of having a &quot;responsibility&quot; to accurately portray the condition. &quot;Variety&quot; said his performance was &quot;remarkable.. utterly convincing&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot; found him &quot;outstanding&quot; while the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt he was &quot;reminiscent of Daniel Day-Lewis in &quot;My Left Foot&quot;, bringing a vibrancy and wit to the role&quot;. Also that year, Sheen starred in the short film &quot;Airlock, or How To Say Goodbye in Space&quot; with Derek Jacobi and was invited to join the actors&#x27; branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences.

Sheen reprised the role of David Frost in 2008&#x27;s &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot;, a film dramatisation of The Nixon Interviews of 1977. Despite appearing in the original stage production in a part written for him by Peter Morgan, Sheen was surprised to have been cast in the film: &quot;Peter said he&#x27;d only be prepared to give the rights to someone who would cast me as Frost, which was very nice, but when the studios get their hands on something... Right up until we started filming I was prepared to be disappointed&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; asserted that Sheen embodied his character in a &quot;compelling, intense&quot; performance while &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; felt he was &quot;a brilliant actor&quot; who &quot;grows his character from a bright-eyed social butterfly to a gimlet-eyed interrogator&quot;. However, &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt &quot;the likable, watchable Mr. Sheen has been pitted against a scene-stealer&quot; in Frank Langella&#x27;s Nixon. Frost himself later said it was &quot;a wonderful performance&quot;. Sheen was the recipient of the Variety Award at the British Independent Film Awards 2008., while Langella was nominated for an Academy Award.
In 2009, portrayed another public figure; he starred in &quot;The Damned United&quot; as the outspoken football manager Brian Clough. The Tom Hooper-directed film focused on Clough&#x27;s disastrous 44-day tenure as manager of Leeds United and marked Sheen&#x27;s fifth collaboration with writer Peter Morgan. He said Clough is the real-life character he enjoyed playing most. &quot;The Guardian&quot;, writing in 2009, declared it the &quot;best performance of his big-screen career&quot; while &quot;The Times&quot; found him &quot;magnificent&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; asserted that, despite American audiences&#x27; unfamiliarity with Clough, &quot;what&#x27;s lost in translation is recovered easily enough in Michael Sheen&#x27;s astonishing performance&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; noted that his &quot;typically scrupulous channelling of Clough gets the tics and mannerisms right, but also carves a moving portrait of a braggart suddenly out of his depth&quot;. Also in 2009, Sheen reprised his role as a werewolf in &quot;&quot;, a prequel to the original film. Of his decision to take part, Sheen has said: &quot;My rule of thumb is that I want to do things I&#x27;d like to go and see myself.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt he was &quot;the movie&#x27;s greatest asset ... [taking] a lively break from his usual high-crust duties to bring wit, actual acting and some unexpected musculature to the goth-horror flick&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; said he hit &quot;all the right notes in a star-powered performance that will amuse, if not amaze, anyone who only knows the actor as Tony Blair or David Frost&quot; while Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; noted that he &quot;tries bravely to keep a straight face&quot;

Sheen had a supporting role in 2009&#x27;s &quot;The Twilight Saga: New Moon&quot;, the second film in the highly popular vampire series. In its review, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said: &quot;Late in the film, a real actor, Michael Sheen, shows up as the mind-reading Aro, of the Italian Volturi vampires, and sparks things up. You can almost hear the young cast thinking, &#x27;Is that acting? It looks hard.&#x27; So Sheen is quickly ushered out.&quot; While &quot;The New York Times&quot; said he &quot;preens with plausible menace&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot; felt he &quot;plays the character with more high-pitched giddiness than menace&quot;. He was named Actor of the Year at &quot;GQ&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual Men of the Year ceremony. Sheen made two one-off stage appearances in 2009; he performed a scene from &quot;Betrayal&quot; as part of a Harold Pinter tribute evening at the National Theatre and performed improvisational comedy as part of The Groundlings&#x27; &quot;Crazy Joe Show&quot; in Los Angeles.

===&quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Masters of Sex&quot; (2010–2018)===
In 2010, Sheen had a supporting role in the science fiction sequel &quot;&quot;. Referring to his David Bowie-esque character, Sheen has said, &quot;I was paid to show off basically&quot;. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; found little fun in the movie &quot;except for a gleefully campy turn by Michael Sheen&quot; while &quot;The New York Times&quot; said he &quot;shows up to deliver the closest thing to a performance in the movie&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; felt his &quot;lively hamming as a cane-swishing nightclub owner merely underlines how impersonal—how inhuman—much else here is&quot;. However, &quot;USA Today&quot; felt his &quot;scenery-chewing performance ... is meant as comic relief, but this movie thunders along so seriously that the attempt at humor feels jarring&quot;. In other 2010 film work, Sheen voiced Nivens McTwisp, the White Rabbit, in Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and Dr. Griffiths in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue&quot; and appeared as a terrorist in &quot;Unthinkable&quot;. On television, Sheen&#x27;s performance in the third instalment of Peter Morgan&#x27;s Blair trilogy, &quot;The Special Relationship&quot;, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Miniseries or Movie. The HBO film examined the &quot;special relationship&quot; between the US and the UK in the political era of Blair and Bill Clinton. It was the sixth collaboration between Sheen and Peter Morgan; both parties have since said they will not work together again &quot;for the foreseeable future&quot;. Sheen also made a guest appearance in four episodes of NBC&#x27;s &quot;30 Rock&quot; as Wesley Snipes, a love interest for Tina Fey&#x27;s Liz Lemon. Fey, the sitcom&#x27;s star and creator, has said that &quot;he was so funny and delightful to work with&quot;. In November 2010, Sheen received the BAFTA Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year.
In 2011, Sheen starred in and was creative director of National Theatre Wales&#x27;s &quot;The Passion&quot;, a 72-hour secular passion play staged in his hometown of Port Talbot, Wales. In addition to a professional cast, over one thousand local amateurs took part in the performance and as many more volunteers from local charity and community groups were involved in preparations in the months leading up to the play. The event was the subject of both a BBC documentary and &quot;The Gospel of Us&quot;, a film by director Dave McKean. Sheen has described it as &quot;the most meaningful experience&quot; of his career. &quot;The Observer&quot; declared it &quot;one of the outstanding theatrical events not only of this year, but of the decade&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot;″s critic described it as &quot;the most extraordinary piece of community-specific theatre I&#x27;ve ever beheld&quot;. While &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; bemoaned the large-scale production&#x27;s logistical problems, &quot;overall I found it touching, transformative and, in its own wayward way, a triumph.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; felt it was &quot;so much more than just an epic piece of street theatre..transforming and uplifting&quot;. Sheen and co-director Bill Mitchell were jointly honoured as Best Director at the Theatre Awards UK 2011. In 2013, Sheen won Best Actor at Welsh BAFTA for the production.

Sheen&#x27;s most notable film appearance of 2011 was a supporting role in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot;. Allen noted that &quot;Michael had to do the pseudo-intellectual, the genuine intellectual, the pedant, and he came in and nailed it from the start&quot;. Sheen enjoyed playing &quot;someone who&#x27;s just absolutely got no sense that he&#x27;s overstepping the mark or that he&#x27;s being a bore.&quot; The film opened the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and became Allen&#x27;s highest-grossing film to date. Also in 2011, Sheen starred in &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot;, an independent drama focusing on the aftermath of a school shooting, voiced the enigmatic and mysterious villain House in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot; written by his friend Neil Gaiman and made cameo appearances in &quot;The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1&quot; and &quot;Resistance&quot;. In 2012 film work, Sheen starred opposite Toni Collette in the independent comedy &quot;Jesus Henry Christ&quot; and reprised his role as the vampire Aro in the final instalment of &quot;The Twilight Saga&quot;.

Sheen played the title role in &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Young Vic in late 2011 and early 2012, a role he first explored in a 1999 BBC Radio 3 production. While there had been tentative plans over the years for both Peter Hall and Michael Grandage to direct Sheen in the play, he eventually asked Ian Rickson. Rickson&#x27;s production was set in the secure wing of a psychiatric hospital and featured original music by PJ Harvey. The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; declared Sheen&#x27;s performance &quot;an audacious achievement&quot; that &quot;will live in the memory&quot; while &quot;The Independent&quot; praised &quot;a recklessly brilliant and bravura performance.&quot; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; felt that Sheen &quot;could be right up there among the great Hamlets&quot;, were it not for Rickson&#x27;s &quot;mindlessly modish&quot; staging, while &quot;The Times&quot; found him &quot;unbearably moving&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described him as &quot;fascinating to watch ... intelligent, inventive and full of insights ... [he] delivers the &quot;What a piece of work is a man&quot; passage with a beautiful consciousness of human potential.&quot; &quot;The Observer&quot; declared him an actor &quot;always worth crossing a principality to see and hear&quot; whose To be, or not to be&#x27; is a marvel.&quot;

In 2013, Sheen appeared in a supporting role as the boyfriend of Tina Fey in the comedy &quot;Admission&quot;, with Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; describing the character as &quot;a whiskery, elfin academic who chuckles to himself as he reads the Canterbury Tales prologue aloud in bed, in Middle English, no less. (Sheen is scarily good at this.)&quot; In 2014, he starred in the fantasy children&#x27;s film &quot;Mariah Mundi and the Midas Box&quot;. R. Kurt Osenlund of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; said &quot;the ever-versatile Sheen brings an artful hamminess to his role&quot; but Matt Pais of &quot;RedEye&quot; found him &quot;insufficiently zany&quot; in &quot;a part that Robert Downey Jr. would nail but never accept.&quot; His second film role of 2014 was a minor role in the political thriller &quot;Kill the Messenger&quot;. Also in 2014, he starred in IFC&#x27;s six-episode &quot;The Spoils of Babylon&quot;, a television parody of classic, sweeping miniseries, in which he played the husband of Kristen Wiig&#x27;s character.

In 2015, Sheen starred opposite Carey Mulligan in the romantic drama &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; as prosperous bachelor William Boldwood. His performance was well received. Anthony Lane of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; remarked: &quot;How you prevent such a fellow, crushed by his own decency, from sagging into a bearded Ashley Wilkes is no easy task, yet Sheen succeeds, and Boldwood&#x27;s brave smile grows dreadful to behold.&quot; Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; found the character &quot;pitiful, and sometimes downright painful to watch. He&#x27;s not Hardy&#x27;s Boldwood, but he&#x27;s a Boldwood. The only sad, genuine moment of the film belongs to him.&quot; Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; remarked that Sheen&#x27;s face &quot;is etched with agony and an awful kind of abject adoration, forever trying to find ways to forgive the loved one in advance for rejection. When Sheen&#x27;s Boldwood confides to Oak that he feels &quot;grief&quot; you really can feel his pain.&quot; Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; also referred to the scene where Boldwood expressed his grief, commenting: &quot;Sheen&#x27;s performance is fine-grained, and the pure Englishness of his understatement is heartrending.&quot; Also in 2015, Sheen had well-received comedic television performances in &quot;Comedy Bang! Bang!&quot;, &quot;The Spoils Before Dying&quot; and &quot;7 Days in Hell&quot;. Mary McNamara of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said his television host in &quot;7 Days in Hell&quot; was &quot;played with damp lechery and cigarette-ash mastery.&quot; Liz Shannon Miller of &quot;Indiewire&quot; said he may have &quot;stolen the show&quot; while John DeFore of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described him as the &quot;scene-stealer of the bunch&quot;.
In February 2015 Sheen joined &quot;The Great Comic Relief Bake Off&quot; – the charity version of &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot;, and won the title &quot;Star Baker&quot; of the episode.

Between 2013 and 2016 Sheen starred in and produced Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Masters of Sex&quot;. He and Lizzy Caplan portrayed the 1960s human sexuality pioneers Masters and Johnson; the series chronicled &quot;their unusual lives, romance and pop culture trajectory, which saw them go from a Midwestern teaching hospital to the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine and Johnny Carson&#x27;s couch&quot;. David Sims of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described Sheen&#x27;s portrayal of Masters as &quot;an intensely honest and unsympathetic one&quot; while Sonia Saraiya of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; said Sheen played the role &quot;so seamlessly it&#x27;s hard to remember that there&#x27;s a British actor there who has played flamboyant news personalities and prime ministers.&quot; Sean T. Collins of &quot;The Observer&quot; described Masters as &quot;a singularly unappealing figure&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s not that Michael Sheen is bad in the role. On the contrary! Sheen&#x27;s skill in playing Masters as an asshole who oscillates between headache-inducing self-repression and volcanic rage renders him unpleasant to spend more than two minutes with at a time.&quot; Tim Goodman of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; remarked: &quot;Masters has never been very likable. In fact, it&#x27;s a testament to Sheen&#x27;s performance— and Caplan&#x27;s nuanced Johnson offsetting Masters—that anyone still cares what happens to Masters on a personal level.&quot; He received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in late 2013.

In 2016 Sheen had supporting roles in the dramas &quot;Nocturnal Animals&quot; and &quot;Norman&quot;, and the science fiction romance &quot;Passengers&quot;. He also reprised his role as the White Rabbit in the fantasy adventure &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot;. Sheen also starred in BBC Wales documentary &quot;Michael Sheen: The Fight For My Steel Town&quot; and won Welsh BAFTA Award for News and Current Affairs. In 2017, he had supporting roles in the dramatic comedies &quot;Brad&#x27;s Status&quot; and &quot;Home Again&quot;. In 2018, Sheen was cast as unconventional lawyer Roland Blum in season 3 of television series &quot;The Good Fight&quot;.

===&quot;Good Omens,&quot; &quot;Staged&quot; and &quot;Best Interests&quot; (2019–2023)===

In May 2019 Sheen starred alongside David Tennant in &quot;Good Omens&quot;, based on the novel of the same name written by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman and was cast as Chris Tarrant in the TV adaptation of James Graham&#x27;s stage play &quot;Quiz&quot;. From September 2019 through May 2021, Sheen played the role of Martin Whitly in the American television series &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; on Fox. In April 2020, &quot;Quiz&quot; was shown on ITV. On 14 April, when the ITV channel broadcast the second instalment, the continuity announcer introduced him as &quot;Martin Sheen&quot;, a different actor. Sheen reacted to this by changing his Twitter handle to &quot;Martin Sheen&quot;. In June 2020, Sheen starred alongside David Tennant again in a six-part television lockdown comedy entitled &quot;Staged&quot;, which was made using video-conferencing software. A second eight-episode series started airing in January 2021. In June 2021, Sheen returned to the London stage, after its protracted period of Covid-19 shutdown, in Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; in the Olivier Theatre at the National Theatre. A new production of &quot;Amadeus&quot;, scheduled for December 2022 at the Sydney Opera House, was announced in July 2022 with Sheen as Salieri. Sheen won Best Performer in a Play at the 2023 BroadwayWorld Australia – Sydney Awards for his performance.

Continuing Sheen&#x27;s professional partnership with Tennant, a third six-episode series of &quot;Staged&quot; aired in its entirely on 14 November 2022, while a second six-episode series of &quot;Good Omens&quot; premiered on 28 July 2023. In June 2023, Sheen starred in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Best Interests,&quot; which won him Best Actor in International Competition at the 2023 Series Mania. In November 2023, Sheen was cast as Prince Andrew, Duke of York for a limited series entitled &quot;A Very Royal Scandal.&quot; Sheen will continue his partnership with Tennant in the finale episode for Good Omens, a 90 minute program currently being filmed in Edinburgh.

=== &quot;The Way,&quot; &quot;Nye&quot; and &quot;A Very Royal Scandal&quot; (2024–present) ===
From 19 February to 4 March 2024 Sheen directed and starred in a three-part television series called &quot;The Way&quot; on BBC One and BBC iPlayer. From February to June 2024, Sheen performed on stage as Aneurin Bevan in &quot;Nye&quot;, a play written by Tim Price and directed by Rufus Norris. The play ran in the Royal National Theatre from 24 February until 11 May, and at the Wales Millennium Centre from 18 May to 1 June. In April 2024, Sheen guested on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Assembly&quot; for Autism Acceptance Week, and was praised for his &quot;heartwarming&quot; interaction with neurodivergent journalists. Sheen answering a question from journalist Leo was nominated for TV Moment of the Year at the Edinburgh TV Festival Awards. In June 2024, Sheen joined the BBC Radio 4&#x27;s environmental documentary podcast &quot;Buried Series 2: The Last Witness&quot; as the hearsay witness who recorded dead witness Douglas Gowan&#x27;s final testimony. &quot;A Very Royal Scandal&quot; was released on 19 September 2024 on the streaming service Amazon Prime Video. Following a sell-out run in 2024, Sheen will reprise his role as Aneurin Bevan in the play &quot;Nye&quot; in August 2025.

On 10 January 2025, Sheen announced that he had launched a new national theatre for Wales named Welsh National Theatre after the National Theatre Wales was forced to close due to the company&#x27;s £1.6m funding from the Arts Council of Wales being cut. He would personally fund the Welsh National Theatre from the outset as well as taking on the role of artistic director.

==Charity work==
Sheen is honorary president of Wales Council for Voluntary Action, the lead national body for the voluntary sector in Wales. Accepting the role he explained, &quot;I plan to use my role to actively challenge and support WCVA in their impact and role in supporting the community and keeping us focused on what matters locally as well as the need for national leadership&quot;. He is also an ambassador for &quot;TREAT Trust Wales&quot;, and is the Welsh ambassador of Into Film, a charity which offers after-school film clubs to state primary and secondary schools in an effort to improve literacy levels. He is also an ambassador of the environmental charity Keep Wales Tidy. 
Sheen is a patron of British charities, including Scene &amp; Heard, NSPCC&#x27;s Child&#x27;s Voice Appeal, Healing the Wounds, The Relationships Centre, WGCADA (West Glamorgan Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse) and Adferiad Recovery, a new organisation providing support for vulnerable people in Wales and their families and carers. He has taken part in a number of charity football matches, including captaining the winning Soccer Aid 2010 team at Wembley Stadium, as well as appearing in the 2012 and 2014 matches. He is a patron of the British Independent Film Awards, an ambassador for the Dylan Thomas Prize and vice-president of Port Talbot Town F.C.
In October 2018, Sheen sponsored a women&#x27;s football team in Wales.

In 2014 Sheen designed a Shakespeare-themed Paddington Bear statue. Placed outside Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, it was one of fifty statues of Paddington located around London prior to the release of the film &quot;Paddington&quot;, which were auctioned to raise funds for the NSPCC. In 2017, Sheen founded the End High Cost Credit Alliance working to promote more affordable ways to borrow money. That same year Sheen became a Patron of Social Enterprise UK, a charity which supports social projects which benefit local, environmental and co-operative causes. In October 2018, Sheen and Natasha Kaplinsky became vice-presidents (an ambassadorial role) of the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH). Sheen is a fundraising partner with the non-profit organization, The White Curl, which supports Welsh charities. As of 2023, his campaigns with The White Curl raised over £110,000 for Welsh charities and causes.

In 2019, Sheen sold his own houses to fund the Homeless World Cup in Cardiff when its £2,000,000 funding fell through at the last minute. In 2020, he raised more than £33,000 to help people in Wales whose homes have been hit by flooding in the wake of Storm Dennis. 

In December 2021, Sheen announced that he would be giving all of his future earnings to charities, declaring himself a &quot;not-for-profit actor&quot;. That same year he co-founded &quot;A Writing Chance&quot;, which gives new and aspiring writers from working-class and lower-income backgrounds resources and access to the writing industries. The writers and their stories would then be introduced on the &quot;Michael Sheen: Margins to Mainstream&quot; podcast on BBC Radio Wales.

In October 2024, it was reported that Sheen had used his own money to write off personal debts for hundreds of people in South Wales. He did not publicly announce the move, but fans discovered it when they spotted Facebook posts in local community groups from a television production company called Full Fat TV.

== Political and social activism ==
Sheen is known for political and social activism. Examples include campaigning against high-cost credit agreements, crises in local journalism and describing himself as a not-for-profit actor due to his contributions to social causes.

He has made calls for discussions about Welsh independence and has made comments about the institution of the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; title. In 2024, Sheen showed support to a cross-party campaign of Plaid Cymru and Welsh Labour focused on devolving the Crown Estate to Wales. He also called for a Fair Banking Act to help tackle the unaffordable credit crisis in the UK.

==Personal life==
Sheen was in a relationship with English actress Kate Beckinsale from 1995 until 2003. They met when cast in a touring production of &quot;The Seagull&quot; in early 1995, and began living together shortly afterwards. Their daughter Lily Mo was born in 1999 in London. Their relationship ended in January 2003, soon after the couple moved to Los Angeles. Beckinsale had persuaded director Len Wiseman to cast Sheen in &quot;Underworld&quot;; but while on set, she and Wiseman began a relationship, and subsequently married in 2004.

Sheen had a long-distance relationship with English ballet dancer Lorraine Stewart from late 2004 until mid-2010. He dated Canadian actress Rachel McAdams from autumn 2010 to early 2013 and American comedian and actress Sarah Silverman from early 2014 to early 2018.

Sheen now lives in Port Talbot, Wales with his current partner, actress Anna Lundberg. The couple have two daughters together, born September 2019 and May 2022.

He is a supporter of Swansea City A.F.C.

===Return of OBE===
Sheen was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours for his services to drama. In 2020, Sheen revealed, during an online interview with Owen Jones, that he had &quot;handed back&quot; the medal after doing research for a lecture on the relationship between Wales and the British state, saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t mean any disrespect but I just realised I&#x27;d be a hypocrite if I said the things I was going to say in the lecture about the nature of the relationship between Wales and the British state&quot;. Individuals who voluntarily renounce an honour continue to legally hold it unless it is annulled by the monarch.

===Other honours===
He was awarded the freedom of the borough of Neath Port Talbot, Wales in 2008 for his services in the field of the dramatic arts. He is an Honorary Fellow of the University of Wales, Newport, the Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama, Swansea University, Aberystwyth University, Swansea Metropolitan University and Cardiff University, and has been awarded the James Joyce Award by University College Dublin. Sheen was given an Honorary Doctorate as Doctor of Arts by University of Wales in 2013.

He has narrated six novels for BBC Radio 4 and Naxos AudioBooks: &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1994), &quot;The Idiot&quot; (1995), &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1995), &quot;A White Merc With Fins&quot; (1997), &quot;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&quot; (2013).

<doc id="277797" wikidata="Q328482" url="?curid=277797" title="Black Sabbath (album)">
<text>Black Sabbath is the debut studio album by English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, released on 13 February 1970 by Vertigo Records in the United Kingdom and on 1 June 1970 by Warner Bros. Records in the United States. The album is widely regarded as the first true heavy metal album, and the opening title track, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, was named the greatest heavy metal song of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and has been referred to as the first doom metal song.

&quot;Black Sabbath&quot; received generally negative reviews from critics upon its release but was a commercial success, reaching number eight on the UK Albums Charts and number 23 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart. It has retrospectively garnered reappraisal as one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time. &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; is included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s 2005 musical reference book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Recording==
According to Black Sabbath&#x27;s guitarist and founding member Tony Iommi, the group&#x27;s debut album was recorded in a 12-hour session on 16 October 1969. Iommi said: &quot;We just went in the studio and did it in a day, we played our live set and that was it. We actually thought a whole day was quite a long time, then off we went the next day to play for £20 in Switzerland.&quot; Aside from the bells, thunder and rain sound effects added to the beginning of the opening track and the double-tracked guitar solos on &quot;N.I.B.&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Village&quot;, there were virtually no overdubs added to the album. Iommi recalls recording live: &quot;We thought, &#x27;We have two days to do it and one of the days is mixing.&#x27; So we played live. Ozzy was singing at the same time, we just put him in a separate booth and off we went. We never had a second run of most of the stuff.&quot;

The key to the band&#x27;s new sound on the album was Iommi&#x27;s distinctive playing style that he developed after an accident at a sheet metal factory where he was working at the age of 17 in which the tips of the middle fingers of his fretting hand were severed. Iommi created a pair of false fingertips using plastic from a dish detergent bottle and down tuned the strings on his guitar to make it easier for him to bend the strings, creating a massive, heavy sound. &quot;I&#x27;d play a load of chords and I&#x27;d have to play fifths because I couldn&#x27;t play fourths because of my fingers,&quot; Iommi explained to Phil Alexander in &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2013. &quot;That helped me develop my style of playing, bending the strings and hitting the open string at the same time just to make the sound wilder.&quot; In the same article, bassist Geezer Butler added, &quot;Back then the bass player was supposed to do all these melodic runs, but I didn&#x27;t know how to do that because I&#x27;d been a guitarist, so all I did was follow Tony&#x27;s riff. That made the sound heavier.&quot;

Iommi began recording the album with a white Fender Stratocaster, his guitar of choice at the time. Still, a malfunctioning pickup forced him to finish recording with a Gibson SG, a guitar he had recently purchased as a backup but had &quot;never really played.&quot; The SG was a right-handed model, which the left-handed Iommi played upside down. Soon after recording the album, he met a right-handed guitarist who was playing a left-handed SG upside down, and the two agreed to swap guitars; this is the SG that Iommi modified and later &quot;put out to pasture&quot; at the Hard Rock Cafe.

Black Sabbath vocalist Ozzy Osbourne has always spoken fondly of the recording of the band&#x27;s debut album, stating in his autobiography &quot;I Am Ozzy&quot;, &quot;Once we&#x27;d finished, we spent a couple of hours double-tracking some of the guitar and vocals, and that was that. Done. We were in the pub in time for last orders. It can&#x27;t have taken any longer than 12 hours in total. That&#x27;s how albums should be made, in my opinion.&quot; Drummer Bill Ward agrees, telling &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 2001, &quot;I think the first album is just absolutely incredible. It&#x27;s naïve, and there&#x27;s an absolute sense of unity – it&#x27;s not contrived in any way, shape or form. We weren&#x27;t old enough to be clever. I love it all, including the mistakes!&quot; In an interview for the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; series in 2010, Butler added, &quot;It was literally live in the studio. I mean, (producer) Rodger Bain, I think he&#x27;s a genius the way he captured the band in such a short time.&quot; In his autobiography &quot;Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven &amp; Hell with Black Sabbath&quot;, Iommi plays down the producer&#x27;s role, insisting, &quot;We didn&#x27;t choose to work with Rodger Bain, he was chosen for us... He was good to have around, but we didn&#x27;t really get a lot of advice from him. He maybe suggested a couple of things, but the songs were already fairly structured and sorted.&quot;

==Genre==
On release, a writer for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described the music of &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; as &quot;hard blues-rock&quot;. In retrospect, AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey feels that &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; marks &quot;the birth of heavy metal as we now know it&quot;. In his opinion, the album &quot;transcends its clear roots in blues-rock and psychedelia to become something more&quot;. He ascribes its &quot;sonic ugliness&quot; as a reflection of &quot;the bleak industrial nightmare&quot; of the group&#x27;s hometown, Birmingham, England. Huey notes the first side&#x27;s allusions to themes characteristic of heavy metal, including evil, paganism, and the occult, &quot;as filtered through horror films and the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien, H. P. Lovecraft, and Dennis Wheatley.&quot; He characterises side two as &quot;given over to loose blues-rock jamming learned through&quot; the English rock band Cream.

In the opinion of the author and former &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot; magazine editor Jeff Wagner, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; is the &quot;generally accepted starting point&quot; when heavy metal &quot;became distinct from rock and roll&quot;. In his opinion, the album represented a transition from blues rock into &quot;something uglier&quot;, and that this sound &quot;found deeper gravity via mournful singing and a sinister rhythmic pulse&quot;. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, &quot;the album that arguably invented heavy metal was built on thunderous blues-rock&quot;. Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Mike Stagno notes that Black Sabbath&#x27;s combined elements of rock, jazz and blues, with heavy distortion created one of the most influential albums in the history of heavy metal. In retrospect, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; has been lauded as perhaps the first true heavy metal album. It has also been credited as the first record in the stoner rock genre.
Taking a broader perspective, Pete Prown of &quot;Vintage Guitar&quot; says, &quot;The debut Black Sabbath album of 1970 was a watershed moment in heavy rock, but it was part of a larger trend of artists, producers, and engineers already moving towards the sound we now call hard rock and heavy metal.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Black Sabbath&quot; music and lyrics were quite dark for the time. The opening track is based almost entirely on a tritone interval played at slow tempo on the electric guitar. In the 2010 &quot;Classic Albums&quot; documentary on the making of the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Paranoid&quot;, bassist Geezer Butler claims the riff was inspired by &quot;Mars, the Bringer of War&quot;, a movement in Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;. Iommi reinterpreted the riff slightly and redefined the band&#x27;s direction. Ward told &quot;Classic Albums&quot;, &quot;When Oz sang &#x27;What is this that stands before me?&#x27; it became completely different...this was a different lyric now, this was a different feel. I was playing drums to the words.&quot; The song&#x27;s lyrics concern a &quot;figure in black&quot; which Geezer Butler claims to have seen after waking up from a nightmare. In the liner notes to the band&#x27;s 1998 live album &quot;Reunion&quot; the bassist remembers:
Similarly, the lyrics of the song &quot;N.I.B.&quot; are written from the point of view of Lucifer, who falls in love with a human woman and &quot;becomes a better person&quot; according to lyricist Butler. Contrary to popular belief, the name of that song is not an abbreviation for &quot;Nativity in Black;&quot; according to Osbourne&#x27;s autobiography it is merely a reference to drummer Bill Ward&#x27;s pointed goatee at the time, which was shaped as a fountain pen-nib. The lyrics of two other songs on the album were written about stories with mythological themes. &quot;Behind the Wall of Sleep&quot; is a reference to the H. P. Lovecraft short story &quot;Beyond the Wall of Sleep,&quot; while &quot;The Wizard&quot; was inspired by the character of Gandalf from &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The latter includes harmonica playing by Osbourne. The band also recorded a cover of &quot;Evil Woman,&quot; a song that had been an American hit for the band Crow. In his autobiography, Iommi admits the band reluctantly agreed to do the song at the behest of their manager Jim Simpson, who insisted they record something commercial.

==Artwork==

The cover photograph was shot at Mapledurham Watermill, situated on the River Thames in Oxfordshire, England, by photographer Keith Stuart Macmillan (credited as Keef), who was in charge of the overall design. Standing in front of the watermill is a figure dressed in a black cloak, portrayed by model Louisa Livingstone, whose identity was not widely known until 2020. &quot;I&#x27;m sure (McMillan) said it was for Black Sabbath, but I don&#x27;t know if that meant anything much to me at the time,&quot; Livingstone recalled, adding that it had been &quot;freezing cold&quot; during the shoot. &quot;I had to get up at about 4 o&#x27;clock in the morning. Keith was rushing around with dry ice, throwing it into the water. It didn&#x27;t seem to be working very well, so he ended up using a smoke machine,&quot; she said.

According to McMillan, Livingstone was wearing nothing underneath the black cloak, and some experimentation was done involving some &quot;slightly more risqué&quot; photographs taken at the session. &quot;We decided none of that worked,&quot; McMillan said. &quot;Any kind of sexuality took away from the more foreboding mood. But she was a terrific model. She had amazing courage and understanding of what I was trying to do.&quot;

The inner gatefold sleeve of the original release featured an inverted cross containing a poem written by Roger Brown, McMillan&#x27;s photography assistant. The band were reportedly upset when they discovered this, as it fuelled allegations that they were satanists or occultists; however, in Osbourne&#x27;s memoirs, he says that to the best of his knowledge nobody was upset with the inclusion. Iommi&#x27;s recollection is somewhat different: &quot;Suddenly we had all these crazy people turning up at shows,&quot; he told &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine in 2013. &quot;I think Alex Sanders (high priest of the Wiccan religion) turned up at a gig once. It was all quite strange, really.&quot; The liner notes to the 1998 &quot;Reunion&quot; album state &quot;Unbeknownst to the band, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; was launched in the U.S. with a party with the head of the Church of Satan, Anton LaVey, presiding over the proceedings... All of a sudden Sabbath were Satan&#x27;s Right Hand Men.&quot;

In the years since the iconic cover photo was shot, Livingstone has released electronic music under the name Indreba.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Black Sabbath&quot; was recorded for Fontana Records, but the record company elected to switch the band to another of their labels, Vertigo Records, which housed the company&#x27;s more progressive acts. &quot;I got a call from a guy, Olav Wyper, at a newly-set-up label, Vertigo,&quot; recalled Sabbath manager Jim Simpson. &quot;Olav had been at CBS when I took the album there, and said he&#x27;d now like to do a deal. This was only because, for Vertigo&#x27;s second tranche of new releases, someone had failed to deliver masters for &quot;[the release with catalogue number&quot;] V06. So they signed Black Sabbath as a makeweight, because we had finished masters, which could be delivered in a hurry.&quot; 

Released on Friday the 13th February 1970, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; reached number eight on the UK Albums Charts. Following its United States release in June 1970 by Warner Bros. Records, the album reached number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, where it remained for more than a year and sold one million copies.

&quot;Black Sabbath&quot; received generally negative reviews from contemporary critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Lester Bangs described the band as, &quot;just like Cream! But worse&quot;, and he dismissed the album as &quot;a shuck – despite the murky songtitles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés&quot;. Robert Christgau, writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, panned the album as &quot;bullshit necromancy&quot;. He later described it as a reflection of &quot;the worst of the counterculture&quot;, including &quot;drug-impaired reaction time&quot; and &quot;long solos&quot;.

== Retrospective reviews and legacy ==
Retrospective reviews of &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; have been positive. AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey said it was a highly innovative debut album with several classic metal songs, including the title track, which he felt had the &quot;most definitive heavy metal riffs of all time&quot;. Huey was also impressed by how the band&#x27;s &quot;slowed-down, murky guitar rock bludgeons the listener in an almost hallucinatory fashion, reveling in its own dazed, druggy state of consciousness&quot;. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), journalist Scott Seward highlighted Bain&#x27;s grandiose production on &quot;an album that eats hippies for breakfast.&quot; In the opinion of Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic, &quot;both fans of blues influenced hard rock and heavy metal of all sorts should find something they like on the album.&quot; BBC Music&#x27;s Pete Marsh referred to &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; as an &quot;album that changed the face of rock music.&quot; In Mick Wall&#x27;s book &quot;Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe&quot;, Butler reflects, &quot;The London press absolutely hated us when we made it &#x27;cos they&#x27;d never written an article about us, they didn&#x27;t know of us. When our first album, the first week, went straight into the charts, the London press went, like, what the hell&#x27;s going on here? And they&#x27;ve hated us ever since.&quot;

In 1989, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; number 31 on their &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 1994, it was ranked number 12 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;Top 50 Heavy Metal Albums&quot;. Larkin praised the album&#x27;s &quot;crushing atmosphere of doom&quot;, which he described as &quot;intense and relentless&quot;. In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; magazine included &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; in their list of the &quot;Best Metal Albums of All Time&quot;, stating: &quot;[This album] was to prove so influential it remains a template for metal bands three decades on.&quot; In 2003, it was ranked number 241 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, 243 in a 2012 revised list, and 355 in a 2020 revised list. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; number 44 in their list of the 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time, describing the title track as the song that &quot;would define the sound of a thousand bands&quot;. Additionally, in 2017, the magazine ranked it 5th on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="277805" wikidata="Q316901" url="?curid=277805" title="Edi Rama">
<text>Edi Rama (born Edvin Kristaq Rama on 4 July 1964) is an Albanian politician and painter who has been serving as the 33rd and incumbent prime minister of Albania since 2013 and chairman of the Socialist Party of Albania since 2005. He was Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports from 1998 to 2000. First elected mayor of Tirana in 2000, he was reelected in 2003 and 2007.

The coalition of centre-left parties led by Rama in the 2013 Albanian parliamentary election defeated the incumbent centre-right coalition led by Sali Berisha of the Democratic Party of Albania. Rama was appointed prime minister for a second term following the 2017 Albanian parliamentary election. Rama then won a third term following the 2021 Albanian parliamentary election in which he defeated the Democratic Party candidate Lulzim Basha for the second time in a row.

Rama is the only Albanian prime minister in history to have won three terms in a row. His party has won all six elections since 2013—three parliamentary ones and three local ones. Under his decade of tenure, Albania has seen economic growth but also democratic backsliding, with various sources describing his rule as autocratic. Albania has also continued to suffer from emigration.

Rama was one of the initiators of Open Balkan, an economic zone of the Western Balkan countries intended to guarantee the &quot;Four Freedoms&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Edvin Rama was born on 4 July 1964 in Tirana, he is the first of two children of Kristaq and Aneta Rama. His father was Kristaq Rama (1932–1998), a well-known sculptor born in Durrës who created numerous statues during the communist era in Albania and had close ties to the communist regime. Rama was a signatory to a 1988 death sentence of opposition poet Havzi Nela. His great-grandfather, also named Kristaq Rama, was an intellectual who advocated for Albanian independence and schools, and he originated from Berat before later relocating to Durrës. Other ancestors from his paternal side come from the southeastern village of Dardhë, near Korçë. His mother, Aneta Rama (née Koleka) (1938–2020), was a graduate of medicine from the southwestern village of Vuno, Vlorë, and a great-niece of Spiro Koleka, a member of the Politburo during Communist Albania. Rama states that the Koleka family, going back some centuries, is of northern Mirditor origin, and that the surname was derived from &quot;Kol Leka&quot;.

Rama started painting early in his childhood. During his teenage years, his talent was noticed by two influential Albanian painters of the time, Edi Hila and Danish Jukniu. They encouraged Rama to further develop his painting skills in a professional context. He attended and graduated from the Jordan Misja Artistic Lyceum, an art school in Tirana. As a teenager, Rama was involved in sports as a professional basketball player for Dinamo Tirana. He was also part of the Albania national basketball team. In 1982, he enrolled in the Academy of Arts in Tirana. After graduating, Rama started working as an instructor at the Academy of Arts. During this time, he organized several open student meetings, during which the Albanian communist government was publicly criticized. Essays from those meetings were collected in the book &quot;Refleksione&quot;, which Rama published together with publicist Ardian Klosi in 1992.

Shortly before the fall of communism in Albania, Rama attempted several times to get involved with the incipient fight for democracy. He tried to influence student protests and become part of the newly created Democratic Party of Albania but soon left after a quarrel over ideological matters with Sali Berisha. In 1994, Rama moved to France, and tried to begin a career as a painter. He and his former student, Anri Sala, exhibited their works in several art galleries. On 27 November 2002, Rama officially changed his first name to Edi.

==Political career==
During one of his trips back to Albania in January 1997, Rama suffered a physical assault. While perpetrators were never found, there were concerns over the involvement of the State Secret Service given Rama&#x27;s outspoken criticism towards the Albanian government.

In 1998, while in Albania for the funeral of his father, Rama was offered a cabinet position by then-Prime Minister of Albania Fatos Nano. Later that year he was appointed Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports. As a Minister, Rama immediately became known for his extravagance in a variety of ways, including his unique colorful dressing style. His innovative cultural projects, coupled with his unusual clothing and rebellious political style, helped him attract a great level of support.

===Mayor of Tirana (2000–2011)===
In October 2000, the Socialist Party of Albania-the former Communist Party-endorsed Rama in the election for Mayor of Tirana. The Democratic Party nominee was Besnik Mustafaj, a writer and diplomat. Rama won 57% of the vote, and was sworn in as mayor. After taking office, he undertook a radical campaign of bulldozing hundreds of illegal constructions and restoring many areas near Tirana&#x27;s center and Lanë River into their initial form.

Rama earned international recognition by repainting the facades of many soviet-style, demolishing buildings in the city. The repainting gave the city a unique style, turning it into a tourist attraction. Rama was awarded the inaugural World Mayor Prize in 2004. The award committee, explained their decision stating that &quot;Edi Rama is the man who changed a whole city. Now there is a new Tirana, colored, happy, with a new and improved infrastructure and cultural life&quot;.

As mayor he compiled the &quot;Tirana City Master Plan&quot; including the Skanderbeg Square project. He planted thousands of new trees, making Tirana a much more environment-friendly city. Rama also expanded the existing roads and paved new ones, improving mobility. According to a UNDP report Rama played a critical role in the modernization of the local government, empowering municipalities and giving them, for the first time real power to impact the life of their communities.

Rama was reelected Mayor of Tirana by defeating Democratic Party candidates Spartak Ngjela, a former attorney, in 2003, and Sokol Olldashi in 2007. In 2011, Rama decided to run for a fourth term in office. His opponent, Lulzim Basha was a member of Prime Minister Berisha&#x27;s cabinet. Rama&#x27;s reelection bid failed in a hotly contested election, after a court ruling decided hundreds of ballots mistakenly cast in the wrong ballot boxes were valid. The initial count saw Rama ahead by 10 votes. With all ballots counted Lulzim Basha won the race by 81 votes. Rama appealed the court&#x27;s decision at the Electoral College and demanded the reinstatement of the initial tally. Rama&#x27;s appeals were rejected, and Basha was sworn in as the new Mayor of Tirana. Rama and the Socialist Party criticized the judges involved in the court ruling.

===Leader of the opposition (2005–2013)===
Having previously run as an independent in 2000, Rama registered as a Socialist in 2003. Later that year he announced a bid for the chairmanship of the Party. He and Rexhep Meidani, former President, ran against the incumbent, Fatos Nano. Rama&#x27;s bid failed to gain sufficient support from the Assembly delegates. He received 41 votes, Rexhep Meidani received 61, while Fatos Nano was reelected with 456 votes.

After the center-left coalition lost in the 2005 parliamentary election, Fatos Nano resigned as Chairman of the Socialist Party. In the subsequent election for the chairmanship of the Party, Rama defeated Rexhep Meidani 297 to 151 and became the Chairman of the Socialist Party. Capitalising on Rama&#x27;s popularity as a mayor, the Socialist Party of Albania regained some of its appeal. Rama replaced many of the Party&#x27;s influential leaders with younger loyalists. In his earlier attempts to regain control in the Parliament, he tried to frame himself as a political outsider. Inspired by the progressive policies of Tony Blair&#x27;s &quot;New Labour&quot; and Anthony Giddens &quot;Third Way&quot;, his political platform called for a &quot;third direction beyond the traditional right and left&quot;.

As the minority leader, Rama threw his support behind a set of constitutional amendments introduced in the Parliament during the summer of 2008. These amendments changed Albania&#x27;s election law from a majoritarian representation with a proportional adjustment into a party-list proportional representation as well as curtailed Presidential powers. Despite criticism and protests from President Bamir Topi and MPs from the Socialist Movement for Integration and other smaller political parties, the amendments were passed in the Parliament with a super-majority.

Rama&#x27;s reelection as mayor in 2007 was greatly helped by the Socialist Movement for Integration&#x27;s endorsement of his candidacy. Seeing the 2008 constitutional amendments voted by Rama&#x27;s SPA as a serious threat to their existence in Albanian politics, Ilir Meta and the SMI did not join Rama in a pre-electoral coalition for the 2009 parliamentary election. The Socialist Party led by Rama were only able to win 66 seats in the Parliament. Incumbent prime minister Berisha&#x27;s Democratic Party won 70 seats, while the remaining 4 seats went to Ilir Meta&#x27;s Socialist Movement for Integration. Demands by Rama and the Socialists for a recount in the district of Fier were rejected by courts amidst criticism about the judges impartiality. Eventually, all four newly elected SMI members of the parliament voted support for Prime Minister Berisha&#x27;s Democrats.

The 2009 elections narrow defeat prompted Rama to continue his mandate as chairman of the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party opted for a hardcore dispute of the newly elected government by boycotting parliamentary debates for months and staging a hunger strike to prompt for domestic and foreign attention to the situation. The heated political debate surrounding the 2009 election has been pointed out as one reason for Albania&#x27;s failed bid at gaining official candidate status in accession talks with the EU.

In January 2011, a recorded videotape showed Deputy Prime Minister Ilir Meta negotiating informal pay-to-play fees with Dritan Prifti, Minister for the Economy, Commerce and Energy. On 21 January 2011, clashes broke out between police and protesters in an anti-government rally in front of the Government building in Tirana. Four people were shot dead by government special forces. The EU issued a statement to Albanian politicians, warning both sides to refrain from violence.

==Prime Minister of Albania (2013–present)==
In 2013, the Socialist Party of Rama led the coalition of center-left parties (that included his former opponents, the SMI) into a landslide victory in the parliamentary election defeating the center-right coalition led by Prime Minister Sali Berisha. His platform, nicknamed &quot;Renaissance&quot; was based on four pillars: European integration, economic revitalisation, restoration of the public order and democratisation of the state institutions. Since September 2013, Rama has been serving as the Prime Minister of Albania.

===Policies as Prime Minister===

Since 11 September 2013, Rama is serving as the 33rd Prime Minister of Albania. During the electoral campaign, Rama stated that the return of public order was his number one priority. In 2013, the Albanian Police was able to cover actively only 55% of the territory. The Government invested heavily in modernizing, training, and improving financial benefits of the police force. The police earned international acclaim when in 2014 undertook a highly successful operation on Lazarat, a remote village in the south of the country, known for the production of narcotics.

Rama has been committed to restructure the judicial system in Albania, which was one of the most corrupted and ineffective judicial systems in Europe at that time. In 2016, the Parliament approved the vetting law. Based on this law, any judge or prosecutor which cannot explain his source of wealth or former dubious verdicts will be disqualified for life. In November 2016, the European Union stated that a successful implementation of vetting law remains the sole criterion to fulfill before opening accession talks.

Other key reform was in the energy sector, left on the brink of bankruptcy from a previous failed privatisation effort. His government successfully enforced the payment of billions of unpaid bills and heavily invested in the modernization of the obsolete power distribution network. The economic growth, from 0.5% in 2013, accelerated to 3.5% in 2016 and is expected to exceed 4% during 2017. Unemployment has been reduced steadily, thanks to 183,000 new jobs created in his first mandate. Furthermore, with 11.5% (2019) Albania has the 5th lowest unemployment rate in the Balkans.

Other important reforms include the administrative reform, the social welfare and pension system reform, and the reform in higher education. Internationally, Rama is pursuing a historical reconciliation policy between Albanians and Serbs and his visit in Belgrade, in 2014 was the first visit of an Albanian Prime Minister in Serbia in over 70 years. In a second visit, during the Economic Forum of Nis, Rama compared the Albanian and Serbian reconciliation process with the historical reconciliation between the French and Germans after the Second World War. Rama is also a key supporter of the Berlin Process, an intergovernmental platform of cooperation between the European Union and Western Balkans countries.

The Socialist Party led by Rama participated at the 2017 parliamentary elections on 25 June 2017. One day after, partial results suggested that the Socialist Party had won a majority. Which so happened.

Rama and Ramush Haradinaj, then Prime Minister of Kosovo, had a clash in late 2019 due to different views on the Mini-Schengen initiative. Rama stated that Haradinaj &quot;lies due to ignorance or on purpose&quot;. In 2020 Rama filed a lawsuit for defamation against Haradinaj.

In 2024, Rama announced plans to create a new European microstate called the Sovereign State of the Bektashi Order enclaved within Tirana. The new country is planned to serve as the headquarters of the Bektashi Order, a Sufi Islamic order led by Baba Mondi.

==Domestic policy==
Rama has adopted a neo-liberal economic policy. It reduces public spending and promotes public-private partnerships in most sectors (tourism, higher education, health, public works, culture). The International Monetary Fund (IMF), traditionally favorable to these policies, however, considered that the Albanian government was proceeding too quickly with privatisation and exposed the country to &quot;significant fiscal risks&quot;.

Economic growth rates approached 4 percent in 2017 and 2018, the unemployment rate fell from 17.5 percent in 2014 to 11.5 percent in 2020. According to him, the improvement in the economic situation can be explained by the political stability of the country: &quot;We are a country without a Senate, without unions, without a radical left and without comedians who play politics&quot; Nevertheless, salaries remain low and emigration has accelerated since 2014

Drug trafficking has grown considerably, accounting for nearly a third of GDP in 2017. According to estimates by Italian customs, 753,000 cannabis plants were destroyed in 2016, compared to 46,000 in 2014. Such destruction would have affected only 10 percent of the cultivated area. The Minister of the Interior, Saimir Tahiri (in office from 2013 to 2017), has himself been blamed (and sentenced) for his involvement in this traffic.

In 2018, Rama adopted a law, welcomed by the European Union, providing for competition between universities and their openness to the market. Increases in tuition fees have caused discontent among students.

===Albanian earthquake===
On 26 November 2019, an earthquake struck Albania and parliament granted Rama state of emergency powers to deal with the aftermath. Rama visited the earthquake epicentre to see the situation and damage, whereas political rivalries between him, Meta, and Basha were sidelined as they became involved in relief efforts. On 30 November Rama ended the search and rescue operation and the next day he attended the first funeral for the deceased.

Rama reconfigured the state budget for 2020 to manage the post-earthquake situation to provide funds for the construction of homes. Rama called for additional expert assistance and monetary aid geared toward recovery from the international community stating that Albania lacks the capacity &quot;to do this (reconstruction) alone.&quot;

In mid-December, Rama was criticised by NGOs, human rights organisations, and parts of the media of misusing the situation to pass controversial legislation after he sought a three-month extension for his state of emergency powers from parliament. Rama tasked a group of fundraisers to manage the donations from the Albanian diaspora and to provide oversight for their usage. Rama contacted and held discussions with some influential world leaders and countries asking for assistance and the creation of an international donors conference. On 8 December, Rama was present at a Turkish donors conference for Albania that was organised and attended by President Erdogan. In January 2020, Rama publicised preliminary figures on damage caused by the earthquake that totaled more than €1 billion.

===Cabinet===
====1st Cabinet====
The 1st Cabinet of Rama was sworn in by President Bujar Nishani on 11 September 2013, becoming the 8th Cabinet of the Albanian Republic, since the collapse of communism in Albania. The Cabinet is composed of 21 members, with fifteen coming from the Socialist Party, six from the Socialist Movement for Integration. The Cabinet is also the first in which the number of female ministers is equal to the number of male ministers, excluding the Prime Minister.

==== 2nd Cabinet ====
The 2nd Cabinet of Rama was sworn in by President Ilir Meta in September 2017, becoming the 9th Cabinet of the Albanian Republic, since the collapse of communism in Albania. The Cabinet is composed of 15 members, coming all from the Socialist Party. The Cabinet is also the second in which the number of female ministers is equal to the number of male ministers, excluding the Prime Minister.

===Foreign policy===

On several occasions, Rama has stated that the European Union needs to accelerate the integration process of the Western Balkans, considering it the only way to subdue the dangerous fractions in the region, preventing a possible eruption of violence, like the one that hammered the region in the 1990s. Rama has also denounced the rising Russian influence in the region as destabilising.

Rama views Turkey as an important strategic partner and since 2013, he has developed a good personal relationship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In May 2016, Rama attended the wedding of Erdogan&#x27;s daughter and Erdogan&#x27;s presidential inauguration in 2018, whereas Erdogan endorsed him in mid-2017 for Albania&#x27;s parliamentary elections. Rama has strengthened ties with Turkey, namely with the Erdogan government despite possible and growing contradictions with his pro-European enlargement stance. Rama describes Erdoğan as a &quot;friend of Albania and strategic ally&quot;. At his request, he had schools linked to the Gülen movement closed, which he went so far as to describe as a &#x27;terrorist organization&#x27;.

Rama has had a diverse agenda of high-level meetings. Since 2013, he has frequently met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, American President Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang, Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, Pope Francis, and other high-ranking diplomats. Rama, speaking in Israel in 2015, said that Albania was &quot;proud to have been a country where no Jew was released to the Nazis, and where there are incredible stories of Muslim families who protected Jewish families,&quot; and he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed a joint declaration of friendship and a medical research cooperation agreement.

On 10 October 2019, together with Aleksandar Vučić, President of Serbia, and Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of North Macedonia, Rama signed the so-called Mini Schengen deal on regional economic cooperation, including on the free movement of goods, capital, services, and labour between their three countries, while they await progress on EU enlargement. A month later, the leaders presented a set of proposals to achieve the &quot;four freedoms&quot; and the first steps towards them, including the possibility to the open border area. In December, the three leaders also met with Milo Đukanović, President of Montenegro, opening the possibility for the country to join the zone. In 2024, Rama said that Albania was aiming to join the EU by 2030.

Regarding his religious beliefs at present, Rama has declared himself an agnostic stating that &quot;I do not practice any faith other than to the self and other people, but I don&#x27;t believe that the existence or non-existence of God is a matter that can ever be resolved by mortals.&quot;

Rama married actress Matilda Makoçi. The couple divorced in 1991. Rama has a son from his first marriage, Gregor, who is a cancer survivor. Rama&#x27;s daughter-in-law was one of the 51 fatalities in the 2019 Albania earthquake.

==Controversies==
===Involvement in electoral fraud===
In a series of 16 audio tapes published online by the German tabloid &quot;Bild&quot;, Rama and his cabinet members were recorded in conversations with police and members of organized crime ahead of the 2017 Parliamentary elections. In one of the tapes Rama is recorded in a conversation with Arben Keshi, a local police official, asking if &quot;the objective had been met&quot;. In another recording, cabinet member Damian Gjiknuri was heard offering Keshi to send &quot;a van of problematic guys&quot; who &quot;should not be too exposed&quot; but may be needed &quot;just in case&quot; for the election. In other tapes, former Socialist MPs were recorded giving instructions to Keshi and other local officials on bribing constituents with cash and intimidating them with threats. In other tapes published by &quot;Bild&quot;, former mayor of Durrës Vangjush Dako, appointed by SP was heard in conversations with members of drug trafficking and organized crime in connection to the 2017 elections.

===Controversial media law===
In December 2019, the government led by Rama, proposed changes in two laws regarding communications and information services in Albania, with focus on regulating the online media market, forcing them to register and giving authority to institutions controlled by the Parliament to fine online medias and journalists and block their contents.

Also known as the &#x27;anti-defamation&#x27; law, it gives to the authority of Audiovisual Media in Albania (AMA) the competences of fining journalists and they can have their cases heard in court only after paying the AMA-imposed fine. Critics say this clause aims to decimate the finances of independent news outlets, whose limited funding would be likely to expire long before a court even hears the case.

Media organizations in Albania protested the changes in the law, considering them as censoring free-speech and expressing their concerns, because the drafted law didn&#x27;t take in consideration several recommendations made by international actors like the EU Commissioner for Human Rights. The Albanian Ombudsman called the government on not approving the two anti-defamation draft laws, as they do not meet international standards.

The Venice Commission gave its opinion and to its conclusion the proposed media law has a number of flaws to proposed amendments that needs to be changed, in the report the Venice Commission gave a number of recommendations and stated that &quot;Albanian authorities showed willingness to dialogue and addressed their concerns for the protection of freedom of speech&quot;. Rama on Twitter praised the recommendations and stated “Grateful to the Venice Commission for their opinion on Anti-defamation! Without losing any further time, we need to address the matter in the Assembly according to the valuable suggestions and guarantee by law everyone’s right to be defended against defamation, and the obligation of every news outlet to be identified as a subject to the law”.

===Reporters Without Borders===
After Albania fell to a historic low in the Reporters Without Borders&#x27; annual World Press Freedom Index, Rama criticized the organization&#x27;s notation. However Pavol Szalai, the head of the European Union and Balkan Desk, noted that the methodology changed from 2020 to 2022 and that Albania has fallen partly due to this and partly due to countries such as Serbia and Montenegro rising.

Rama took up to Twitter where he accused the organization of making up &quot;lies&quot; and called the accusations &quot;fantasies&quot;. Rama then tweeted: “Journalists victims of police violence in Albania? What a lie! Journalists critical of the government face political attacks? What a fantasy! Ethical self-regulation in the Albanian media? What a mockery! Only the title is missing: We complain about the lack of freedom because we do not know what to do with freedom!” One day after Rama tweeted his denials, RSF reported that he attacked an Albanian reporter who he had previously put on a two-month long embargo.

===Charles McGonigal===
In January 2023, Rama was implicated in a U.S. federal indictment concerning former senior FBI official Charles McGonigal. According to the indictment, in September 2017, McGonigal allegedly met with and tried to sway Rama into awarding an oil-drilling license to an Albanian-based company affiliated with McGonigal&#x27;s business partners. In November 2017, shortly after a meeting with Rama in Albania, McGonigal allegedly informed a United States Department of Justice prosecutor of a potentially new criminal investigation into Nicolas Muzin, a U.S.-based lobbyist who had recently been hired by Rama&#x27;s political rival, Lulzim Basha. The following month, McGonigal dined with Rama in Washington, D.C., and up until early 2018, received information about Muzin from the Albanian Prime Minister&#x27;s office.

Rama has denied any wrongdoing.

===New Sufi Muslim Bektashi microstate proposed===

In September 2024, Rama announced plans to create the smallest sovereign state in the world within the capital city of Tirana for an Islamic Community known as Bektashi Order of the Sufi Order.

===Other controversies===
A photograph of Rama and Barack Obama at a fundraising event in October 2012 was shared by Rama on Facebook and Twitter ahead of Albania&#x27;s 2013 Parliamentary Election, to imply a relationship with Obama. Rama&#x27;s ticket to the event was purchased for $80,000 through intermediaries that pled guilty to making foreign contributions in connection with the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election.

At the beginning of December 2021, on board a Lufthansa plane headed to Detroit from Frankfurt, Rama refused to wear a mask as required by the company&#x27;s COVID-safety guidelines. After Rama vehemently refused, the airplane crew asked the captain to persuade the prime minister to comply with the rules as with all the other passengers. However, Rama refused any proposal and was then escorted off by the federal police.

<doc id="277806" wikidata="Q838552" url="?curid=277806" title="Dehumanizer">
<text>Dehumanizer is the sixteenth studio album by English rock band Black Sabbath. It was first released on 22 June 1992 in the UK by I.R.S. Records and on 30 June 1992 in the US by Reprise Records.

It was Sabbath&#x27;s first and only studio album since &quot;Mob Rules&quot; (1981) to feature vocalist Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice, and their first in nine years to feature original bassist Geezer Butler. Initial writing and demo sessions at Rich Bitch Studios in Birmingham featured drummer Cozy Powell; bootlegs of these sessions exist. However, when Powell became injured with a broken hip, he was replaced with Appice. With Appice back in the band, this effectively reunited the &quot;Mob Rules&quot; lineup. The band spent two weeks writing material before spending six weeks rehearsing and recording demos at Monnow Valley Studios in Wales.

The album&#x27;s lineup – Dio, Appice, Butler and guitarist Tony Iommi – reunited in 2006 for a greatest hits set, &quot;Black Sabbath: The Dio Years&quot;, and a new studio album in 2009, &quot;The Devil You Know&quot; (billed as Heaven &amp; Hell).

The album was re-released, with bonus content, on 7 February 2011.

==Overview==
Lyrically and musically, &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; is considered one of Sabbath&#x27;s heaviest albums. Lyrical themes vary from a computer worshipped as a god (Computer God), to televangelists (TV Crimes), to individualism (I) and doubts about the afterlife (After All (The Dead)).

The album was recorded in Wales, at Rockfield Studios. It was intended to feature Cozy Powell, then Sabbath&#x27;s drummer, but he was immobilised by a broken pelvic bone sustained in a horse riding accident. Dio initially wanted to replace Powell with Simon Wright, from AC/DC and his own band, but Butler and Iommi rejected him. They instead recruited Vinny Appice, who had served as Sabbath&#x27;s drummer during most of Dio&#x27;s previous tenure with the band, from 1980–1982.

During sessions for the album, Tony Martin made a short comeback when invited by the band to try the songs out. He stayed for just a couple of days and the band continued with Dio. Martin stated: &quot;I had already started my first solo album &quot;Back Where I Belong&quot; – so, when I got the call to go back, I was committed by that point. And in fact it was just a couple of months after they had started the thing with Ronnie James Dio. I was determined to finish my solo thing and so turned them down at that point. We did keep in touch though and I went to some shows. Ronnie wasn&#x27;t too pleased, but eventually they had enough and asked me to rejoin again later so it felt like I hadn&#x27;t actually left. In fact, I was never formally fired; the phone just stopped ringing. Ian Gillan [vocalist for Deep Purple, and another ex-Sabbath singer] asked me once if I had actually been fired and I said, &#x27;No.&#x27; He said, &#x27;Neither have I.&#x27; We should just turn up one day and walk on stage!&quot;

Demo sessions with Powell yielded numerous recordings, including two unreleased songs – &quot;The Night Life&quot; (also called &quot;Next Time&quot;), whose riff was later used for &quot;Psychophobia&quot; on &quot;Cross Purposes&quot;, and &quot;Bad Blood,&quot; which sounds very similar to &quot;I&quot; on &quot;Dehumanizer&quot;. These songs can be found, along with other demos and untitled songs, on the &quot;Complete Dehumanizer Sessions&quot; bootleg. &quot;Computer God&quot; was the title of an unreleased song by The Geezer Butler Band, in 1986 – only the title made it to &quot;Dehumanizer&quot;. The Butler version is available as a download on his website. &quot;Master of Insanity&quot; was also an unreleased Geezer Butler Band track, of which the &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; version is essentially a rerecording. &quot;Master of Insanity&quot; was the only track on &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; that Dio did not have a hand in writing the lyrics. Jimi Bell, the guitarist with Butler&#x27;s band actually wrote the song. Geezer promised a credit and payment, but Jimi never was paid or credited for his contributions. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;TV Crimes,&quot; was a criticism of American televangelists, particularly Jeff Fenholt, who briefly worked with Iommi in the mid-1980s on what would become &quot;Seventh Star&quot;.

&quot;We wanted it to be real rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll: real basic,&quot; Dio told WERS&#x27; &quot;Nasty Habits&quot; show. &quot;We wanted to capture what we are live and that&#x27;s really what I think we did. We didn&#x27;t do tons of overdubs or a lot of chorusy kind of things. I think the important thing is that a band should be able to do all the things they do on record live, without any kind of sampling crap or that rubbish – so, of course, we didn&#x27;t. We recorded it true to what the band is: just guitar, bass, drums and vocals, y&#x27;know – a couple of keyboard things here and there.&quot;

Although the Sabbath lineup was the same as 1981&#x27;s &quot;Mob Rules&quot;, the musical direction is very different, and a marked change from their previous material, particularly the preceding &quot;Tyr&quot;. Much of the album anticipates the directions taken by Dio in his eponymous solo band&#x27;s next two records, &quot;Strange Highways&quot; (1993) and &quot;Angry Machines&quot; (1996). Commercially, the album marked a resurgence for Sabbath. It reached the Top 40 in the UK, and peaked at number 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

==Aftermath==
&quot;It was good to try that with Ronnie,&quot; Iommi reflected in 1997. &quot;[But] we lost millions on it... because of the time we took to record it, and fly backwards and forwards to the States with everything, all the gear; bringing it back; recording here [the UK]... A lot of messing about and a lot of money wasted... If it came to it again now, we could plan it different and it&#x27;d be okay, but we had to try that. Originally Cozy was involved, then he wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

This incarnation of Sabbath ended when Dio&#x27;s contract with the band ended several days before the Costa Mesa reunion shows in November 1992. According to Iommi, Dio quit because he was asked to support Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s final shows at Costa Mesa, referring to Ozzy as a &quot;clown.&quot; Dio would not record or perform with the band again until 2006. For the two Costa Mesa shows, the band replaced Dio with Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford; on the second night, Iommi, Butler and original Sabbath drummer Bill Ward joined Osbourne onstage for four songs. Halford and Dio were friends (Dio having been impressed with Halford&#x27;s work ethic on the &#x27;Stars&#x27; project) and Halford would only do the Costa Mesa shows with Dio&#x27;s blessing, which he received when he spoke with Dio by phone. Both shows were unofficially recorded in their entirety and are now widely circulated as audio and video bootlegs.

&quot;Dehumanizer&quot; is included in the Black Sabbath box set &quot;The Rules of Hell&quot;.

&quot;Dehumanizer&quot; was rereleased on 7 February 2011. This version includes a bonus disc with alternate recordings of several songs (&quot;Master of Insanity,&quot; &quot;Letters from Earth&quot; and &quot;Time Machine,&quot; the latter of which is available on the US version of the album as a bonus track) and several other songs recorded on 25 July 1992 in Tampa, Florida.

In 2021, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; as the eighth-best Black Sabbath album in a best-to-worst ranking of the band&#x27;s discography.

<doc id="277809" wikidata="Q19161825" url="?curid=277809" title="President of Liberia">
<text>The president of the Republic of Liberia is the head of state and government of Liberia. The president serves as the leader of the executive branch and as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Liberia.

Prior to the independence of Liberia in 1847, executive power in the Commonwealth of Liberia was held by the governor of Liberia, who was appointed by the American Colonization Society. The 1847 Constitution transferred the executive powers of the governorship to the presidency, which was largely modeled on the presidency of the United States.

Between 1847 and 1980, the presidency was exclusively held by Americo-Liberians, the original American settlers of Liberia and their descendants. The original two-party system, with the Republican Party and the True Whig Party, ended in 1878, when the election of Anthony W. Gardiner marked the beginning of 102 years of one-party rule by the True Whigs. Following a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by disgruntled army NCOs and soldiers led by Samuel Doe in 1980, one-party rule of the True Whigs ended and the presidency was vacated until the election of Doe in the 1985 general election. After his overthrow and murder in 1990, the presidency was again vacated for seven years during the First Liberian Civil War and again for two years following the conclusion of the Second Liberian Civil War in 2003.

Under the 1986 Constitution, the president is directly elected by eligible voters to a six-year term, which may be renewed once. Overall, 25 individuals have served as president, including Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first elected female head of state in Africa. On January 22, 2024, Joseph Boakai was sworn in as the twenty-sixth and current president of Liberia.

==History==
Following the establishment of the Commonwealth of Liberia in 1838, executive power was vested in the governor of Liberia, who was appointed and served at the pleasure of the American Colonization Society. The first governor, Thomas Buchanan, served from 1838 until his death in 1841. He was succeeded by Joseph Jenkins Roberts, the first person of African descent to serve as governor of Liberia.

Upon independence in 1847, Roberts was elected as the first president of Liberia. The 1847 Constitution denied suffrage to the indigenous population by requiring voters to own real estate. As a result, the presidency was exclusively held by Americo-Liberians until 1980, when a military coup led by Samuel Doe, an ethnic Krahn, overthrew and murdered President William Tolbert.

The presidency was vacant from 1980 to 1986, with executive power held by Doe as the head of the People&#x27;s Redemption Council. Doe was later elected president in the 1985 general election, making him the first president outside of the Americo-Liberian elite. Doe was later overthrown and murdered in 1990 following the commencement First Liberian Civil War, during which the presidency remained vacant.

Following the 1997 general election, Charles Taylor held the presidency until his resignation on August 11, 2003, as part of a peace deal to end the Second Liberian Civil War. His successor, Moses Blah, ceded executive power on October 13 of that year to Gyude Bryant, the chairman of the Transitional Government of Liberia. The presidency was resumed on January 16, 2006, following the 2005 general election of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as the first female president.

George Weah was elected in 2017 as the 25th president of Liberia. Incumbent president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf signed Executive Order No. 91, thus establishing a Joint Presidential Transition Team, due to the fact that Liberia had &quot;not experienced the transfer of power from one democratically elected president to another democratically elected president for over 70 years&quot;.

==Powers and duties==
The presidency of Liberia is largely modeled on the presidency of the United States.

===Executive functions===
The 1986 Constitution gives the president the power to appoint all cabinet ministers, judges, ambassadors, sheriffs, county officials and military officers with the advice and consent of the Senate. Additionally, the president has the power to dismiss all appointees from office at his or her discretion. The president may also grant pardons or revoke sentences and fines. The president conducts all matters of foreign policy, though any treaties or international agreements must be ratified by both houses of the Legislature. Furthermore, the president serves as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Liberia.

The Constitution also grants the president the power to declare a state of emergency during times of war or civil unrest and suspend civil liberties during the emergency as necessary, with the exception of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. Within seven days of the declaration, the president must state to the Legislature the reasons for the declaration, which both houses must then approve by a two-thirds majority. Otherwise, the president must repeal the state of emergency.

===Legislative functions===
The president must sign all legislation passed by the House of Representatives and Senate. The president may choose to veto any legislation, which may be overturned by a two-thirds majority in both houses. Additionally, the president may exercise a pocket veto by refusing to sign legislation when the end of the twenty-day deadline for signing the bill falls during a recess of the legislature. The president may extend a legislative session past its adjournment date or call a special extraordinary session when deemed necessary for the national interest. The president must also give an annual report to the legislature on the state of the country.

==Eligibility==
To be eligible for office under the current Constitution, a presidential candidate must:
*be a natural born citizen of Liberia (per Art, 27(b) of the Constitution, citizenship is limited to &quot;persons who are Negroes or of Negro descent&quot;);
*be at least thirty-five years old;
*own real property valued at least $25,000;
*have resided in Liberia for at least ten years.

Additionally, the president may not be from the same county as the vice president of Liberia.

==Term and election==
Under the original 1847 Constitution, the president was elected to a two-year term, which was increased to four years on May 7, 1907. Under this amendment, a new president would serve for eight years and could be re-elected to unlimited four-year terms. During the presidency of William Tolbert, the Constitution was amended to restrict the president to a single eight-year term; by 1976, voices in the legislature were being raised in favor of returning to the previous system, but Tolbert proclaimed his support for the existing system and vowed to veto any constitutional amendments to remove term limits.

Currently, the president is elected by popular vote to a six-year term and is limited to two terms. Under the 1986 Constitution, presidential elections utilize a two-round system, wherein a second round of voting is held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes if no single candidate obtains a majority in the first round. Each term begins and ends at noon on the third working Monday in January of the year immediately following the elections. At the time of their inauguration, each president is required under the Constitution to take a presidential oath promising to preserve and defend the Constitution and faithfully execute the law. The oath is administered by the chief justice of Liberia in front of a joint session of the legislature.

==Residence==
In 2006, the Executive Mansion was under renovations due to a fire that damaged parts of the building in July of that year. The office of the president was transferred to the nearby Foreign Ministry building as a result. On 14 February 2022, the Executive Mansion was reopened.

<doc id="277810" wikidata="Q7831165" url="?curid=277810" title="Trace metal">
<text>Trace metals are the metals subset of trace elements; that is, metals normally present in small but measurable amounts in animal and plant cells and tissues. Some of these trace metals are a necessary part of nutrition and physiology. Some biometals are trace metals. Ingestion of, or exposure to, excessive quantities can be toxic. However, insufficient plasma or tissue levels of certain trace metals can cause pathology, as is the case with iron.

Trace metals within the human body include iron, lithium, zinc, copper, chromium, nickel, cobalt, vanadium, molybdenum, manganese and others.

Some of the trace metals are needed by living organisms to function properly and are depleted through the expenditure of energy by various metabolic processes of living organisms. They are replenished in animals through diet as well as environmental exposure, and in plants through the uptake of nutrients from the soil in which the plant grows. Human vitamin pills and plant fertilizers can be a source of trace metals.

Trace metals are sometimes referred to as trace elements, although the latter includes minerals and is a broader category. See also Dietary mineral. Trace elements are required by the body for specific functions. Things such as vitamins, sports drinks, fresh fruits and vegetables are sources. Taken in excessive amounts, trace elements can cause problems. For example, fluorine is required for the formation of bones and enamel on teeth. However, when taken in an excessive amount can cause a disease called &quot;Fluorosis&#x27;, in which bone deformations and yellowing of teeth are seen. Fluorine can occur naturally in some areas in ground water.

== Iron ==

=== Humans ===
Roughly 5 grams of iron are present in the human body and is the most abundant trace metal. It is absorbed in the intestine as heme or non-heme iron depending on the food source. Heme iron is derived from the digestion of hemoproteins in meat. Non-heme iron is mainly derived from plants and exist as iron(II) or iron(III) ions.

Iron is essential for more than 500 hemeproteins, the likes of which include hemoglobin and myoglobin, and account for 80% of iron usage. The other 20% is present in ferritin, hemosiderin, iron-sulfur (Fe/S) proteins, such as ferrochelatase, and more.

== Zinc ==

=== Humans ===
A relatively non-toxic metal to humans and the second most abundant, the body has 2-3 grams of zinc. It can enter the body through inhalation, skin absorption, and ingestion, with the latter of the bunch being the most common. The mucosal cells of the digestive tract contain metallothionein proteins that store the zinc ions.

Nearly 90% of zinc is found in the bones, muscles, and vesicles in the brain. Zinc is a cofactor in hundreds of enzyme reactions and a major component of zinc finger proteins.

== Copper ==

=== Humans ===
The third most abundant trace metal in the human body.

It is found in cytochrome c oxidase, a protein necessary for the electron transport chain in mitochondria.

<doc id="277812" wikidata="Q775216" url="?curid=277812" title="Wowow">
<text>is a satellite broadcasting and premium satellite television station owned and operated by . Its headquarters are located on the 21st floor of the Akasaka Park Building in Akasaka, Minato, Tokyo. Its broadcasting center is in Koto, Tokyo.

== Overview ==
Wowow was the first 24/7, 3 channel, full high-definition broadcaster in Japan.

The channel&#x27;s name is a double &quot;Wow&quot;, and the three W&#x27;s also stand for &quot;World-Wide-Watching&quot;.

== History ==
Wowow began pre-opening broadcasts on November 29, 1990, with service beginning the following day, on November 30, 1990. By 1992, Wowow had 800,000 subscribers. Digital broadcasting began on December 1, 2000. The network began with 207,753 subscribers (31.5 billion yen in sales), growing to 2,667,414 two years later (64.5 billion yen in sales). As of December 2011, Wowow claimed approximately 2.56 million subscribers to its digital service. On July 24, 2011, Wowow shut down its analog broadcast.

Previously, Wowow&#x27;s headquarters were in another facility in Akasaka.

On October 1, 2011, Wowow expanded their single channel broadcast satellite service to provide four high-definition TV channels: Wowow Prime (WOWOWプライム), a general entertainment channel, Wowow Live (WOWOWライブ), covering sports, documentaries, movies and live performances, Wowow Cinema (WOWOWシネマ), a 24-hour movie channel and Wowow Plus.

Wowow also operated a 4K channel which launched in March 2021 and closed on February 28, 2025.

== Programming ==
Wowow mostly rebroadcasts movies, but is also well known for showing (and even co-producing and/or assisting in the production of) original anime series such as &quot;The Big O&quot;, &quot;Brain Powerd&quot;, Overman King Gainer, &quot;Carried by the Wind: Tsukikage Ran&quot;, &quot;Trinity Blood&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; (the complete uncut version), &quot;Ghost Hound&quot;, &quot;Crest of the Stars&quot;, &quot;Ergo Proxy&quot;, &quot;X/1999&quot;, &quot;SHUFFLE!&quot;, &quot;Paranoia Agent&quot;, &quot;Now and Then, Here and There&quot;, &quot;Le Chevalier d&#x27;Eon&quot;, &quot;Shigurui,&quot; &quot;Berserk (2016 TV series)&quot;, as well as the &quot;Anime Complex&quot; block. Due to the looser broadcast standards for satellite television in Japan, Wowow has become a primary means of widespread distribution for anime with themes or subject matter that regular broadcast networks cannot show. Several anime studios have partnership deals for distributing their more mature series, with the famed studio Madhouse among them.

Wowow also broadcasts Japanese-dubbed American television series such as &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;Cold Case&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;The 4400&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, among others. Wowow has also screened Ultimate Fighting Championship events for Japanese audiences, the British comedy sketch show &quot;Little Britain&quot;, as well as the British drama/action show &quot;Ultimate Force&quot; under the name &quot;SAS: British Special Forces&quot;.

Wowow began producing original live-action TV series in 2003. The series called &quot;Drama W&quot; includes works such as &quot;Penance&quot;, &quot;xxxHolic&quot;, &quot;The Grand Family&quot; and &quot;Futagashira&quot;.

=== Sports ===
Wowow has broadcast all four tennis Grand Slam Championships since 2008. They are the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open.

<doc id="277815" wikidata="Q738887" url="?curid=277815" title="On Through the Night">
<text>On Through the Night is the debut studio album by the English rock band Def Leppard, released on 14 March 1980. The album was produced by Tom Allom. It charted at No. 15 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album features re-recorded versions of &quot;Rocks Off&quot; and &quot;Overture&quot;, tracks from the band&#x27;s original independently released EP, &quot;The Def Leppard E.P.&quot;. Other tracks are re-recorded versions of early demos, some of which later appeared on the 2020 box set &quot;The Early Years 79–81&quot;. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on 18 November 1983 and platinum on 9 May 1989.

&quot;Wasted&quot;, &quot;Hello America&quot; and &quot;Rock Brigade&quot; were released as singles. However, the version of &quot;Wasted&quot; that appears on the single is a different recording from that of the LP, as is its B-side, &quot;Hello America&quot;.

The spoken word intro to &quot;When the Walls Came Tumbling Down&quot; was performed by Dave Cousins of Strawbs. Joe Elliott had done the spoken portion in earlier live performances and demo recordings that showed up on some early bootlegs. In his biography, Cousins claims that he did his best Laurence Olivier impersonation for the song&#x27;s intro.

==Reception==

The album received mostly positive reviews. 
AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey noted in a retrospective review that &quot;On Through the Night&quot; &quot;established the band as one of the leading lights of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal.&quot; Although he stated that &quot;it may lack the detailed production and more pop-oriented songwriting of later efforts, (...) some Leppard fans prefer this sound.&quot; Canadian journalist Martin Popoff praised the album for being &quot;one of the most polished and savvy of the NWOBHM&quot;, evoking the sound of &quot;acts like Thin Lizzy, UFO, even Queen and Mott the Hoople.&quot; For him, &quot;On Through the Night&quot; was &quot;a welcome breath of fresh air&quot; among the dark, &quot;thrashy&quot; and &quot;punky&quot; music coming from the UK at the time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s David Fricke reviewed the album favorably on the same wavelength, explaining that it &quot;shows they not only respect their elders, they&#x27;ve taken cues from their New Wave peers, too.&quot; He also stated that &quot;guitarists Pete Willis and Steve Clark shoot from the hip, packing their licks into tight, three-minute pop arrangements&quot;, and that lead singer Joe Elliott &quot;wails wonderfully in a resonating tenor, fortified by backup harmonies and Tom Allom&#x27;s battering-ram production.&quot; He concluded that the band &quot;displays a wisdom beyond their years&quot; in mixing melody and heaviness, coming up with an album that &quot;is awfully impressive for a band making its vinyl debut.&quot; Sputnikmusic staff review noted that the &quot;middle-class common-man image&quot; of the &quot;New Wave of British Heavy Metal&quot; movement &quot;partially played a part in making Def Leppard one of [its] leaders&quot;. He also stated that the band&#x27;s ambition &quot;would never allow [them] to be tunnel-visioned&quot;, but he concluded that &quot;On Through the Night&quot; &quot;can be categorized as a grower of an album since the more superficial elements that would appeal to the mainstream will initially distract some listeners from what is actually an incredibly tight musical and vocal performance.&quot;

&quot;Record World&quot; said that the single &quot;Rock Brigade&quot; has &quot;inventive guitar leads and pulsating dance rhythms.&quot;

Most of the songs on the album were dropped from the band&#x27;s live setlists after 1983, although &quot;Rock Brigade&quot; and &quot;Wasted&quot; would see periodic revivals after 2000. Also, the non-album track from the same era entitled &quot;Good Morning Freedom&quot; would be played live in 2013 during the opening to the &quot;Viva Hysteria&quot; shows.

<doc id="277817" wikidata="Q944387" url="?curid=277817" title="High 'n' Dry">
<text>High &#x27;n&#x27; Dry is the second studio album by the English rock band Def Leppard, released on 6 July 1981. &quot;High &#x27;n&#x27; Dry&quot; was Pete Willis&#x27; last full-time album with Def Leppard. It charted at No. 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 26 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;High &#x27;n&#x27; Dry (Saturday Night)&quot;, ranked No. 33 on VH1&#x27;s 40 Greatest Metal Songs. Following the success of &quot;Pyromania&quot;, the album re-entered in the US chart and reached No. 72 in 1983.

==Music==
The album&#x27;s music has been described as heavy metal and hard rock.

==Reissue==
&quot;High &#x27;n&#x27; Dry&quot; was reissued on 31 May 1984 with two bonus tracks:

#&quot;Bringin&#x27; On the Heartbreak&quot; (Remix), a similar recording to the 1981 original but with synthesiser and piano overdubs added by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange in February 1984. This remix was released as a single in June 1984, peaking at No. 61 in the US charts.
#&quot;Me &amp; My Wine&quot; (Remix), a remixed version of a 1981 B-side, with the remixed version included as the B-side to the remix of &quot;Bringin&#x27; on the Heartbreak&quot;.

The intention of these remixes was to make the two songs sound more in the style of Def Leppard&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Pyromania&quot;.

Videos for both of the remixed songs were made, featuring Phil Collen (who was not in the band at the time of the album&#x27;s recording). The video for &quot;Me &amp; My Wine&quot; received heavy rotation on MTV. Both bonus tracks were omitted from the US mid-1990s re-releases of the album, although other countries&#x27; releases did include them, but returned when Def Leppard and Mercury came to terms in 2018 and the album was put on digital streaming and downloading platforms. 

==Reception==
Steve Huey of AllMusic notes how Def Leppard &quot;continues in the vein of the anthemic, working-class hard rock of their debut. While still opting for a controlled musical attack and melodies as big-sounding and stadium-ready as possible, the band opens up its arrangements a bit more on &quot;High &#x27;n&#x27; Dry&quot;, letting the songs breathe and groove while the rhythm section and guitar riffs play off one another.&quot;

In a 3.5 out of 5 review, Sputnikmusic writes that &quot;while &quot;High &#x27;n&#x27; Dry&quot; cannot claim to be a resounding success as an individual album, it is indeed one from a progression standpoint. Def Leppard is clearly a more confident outfit here and with help from new producer &#x27;Mutt&#x27; Lange, they allow their compositions to include greater scope in order for the band to find their sound. While this does result in some misses, they are never too far off target and are more than made up for by the album’s highlights which have aged extremely well.&quot;

==Track listing==


*On vinyl and cassette releases, &quot;Me &amp; My Wine&quot; (Remix) is added to the end of side one, while &quot;Bringin&#x27; On the Heartbreak&quot; (Remix) leads off side two. On CD releases, &quot;Bringin&#x27; On the Heartbreak&quot; (Remix) and &quot;Me &amp; My Wine&quot; (Remix) follow &quot;No No No&quot;.
*The last lyric, &#x27;no&#x27;, in &quot;No No No&quot; repeats infinitely on the original vinyl album release. The original cassette features &quot;no&quot; being screamed 46 times and then ending abruptly when the cassette finished. On later releases the &quot;no&quot;s simply fade out.

<doc id="277818" wikidata="Q336212" url="?curid=277818" title="William Tolbert">
<text>William Richard Tolbert Jr. (13 May 1913 – 12 April 1980) was a Liberian politician who served as the 20th president of Liberia from 1971 until his assassination in 1980.

Tolbert was an Americo-Liberian and trained as a civil servant before entering the House of Representatives in 1943 for the True Whig Party, then the only established party in Liberia. Tolbert was elected the 23rd vice president of Liberia to William Tubman in 1952 and served in that position until he became president following Tubman&#x27;s death in 1971. Tolbert&#x27;s early presidency saw liberal reforms and the adoption of a Non-Alignment stance, but growing economic troubles and tensions between Americo-Liberians and indigenous Liberians led to instability.

Tolbert was assassinated in the 1980 coup d&#x27;état by the People&#x27;s Redemption Council led by Samuel Doe, marking the end of 133 years of Americo-Liberian rule in Liberia.

==Background==
William Richard Tolbert Jr. was born in Bensonville, Liberia, to William Richard Tolbert Sr. (1869–1948) and Charlotte Augusta Tolbert, née Hoff of Cape Mount, Liberia. The Tolbert and Hoff families were Americo-Liberian families of African American descent and the Hoff family originated from Virginia. William Tolbert Sr. was the son of Daniel Frank Tolbert, who was formerly enslaved in South Carolina and emigrated to Liberia in the Liberian exodus of 1878.

Daniel Frank Tolbert, the South Carolinian grandfather of William Tolbert, emigrated to Liberia aboard the barque &quot;Azor&quot;, alongside several other black South Carolinians who sought to settle in Liberia. The Tolbert clan was one of the largest Americo-Liberian families in Liberia.

He attended Bensonville Elementary School, Crummell Hall Episcopalian High School. He studied at the University of Liberia and obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1934. He married Victoria A. David, of Americo-Liberian and Vai descent, with whom he had eight children.

Tolbert was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1943, and served until being elected vice president in 1951. A Baptist minister, in 1965 he became the first African to serve as president of the Baptist World Alliance, and was also a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. He became Grand Master of the Masonic Order of Liberia.

== Vice presidency (1952–1971) ==
In 1951 Liberia held elections to decide president and vice president. William Tubman who was president in 1951 chose Tolbert as his vice president. They would go on to win and serve 6 terms until Tubman died in 1971.

In February 1968 William R. Tolbert arrived in Jamaica as a part of his Caribbean tour to meet as many Baptists as possible. He met with the prime minister to address a service at the East Queen Street Baptist Church, and other official functions.

On 23 July 1971 President William Tubman died in London during a visit which led Tolbert to become president.

==Presidency and assassination==

Tolbert succeeded to the presidency upon the death of incumbent William Tubman in 1971. To the outside world, the peaceful transfer of power was seen as a sign of continuing political stability in Liberia, a stark contrast with the political turmoil gripping much of the rest of Africa at the time. However, Liberia was effectively a one-party state, with the national legislature and judiciary subservient to the executive branch and only limited observation of civil liberties.

===Attitude towards opposition and indigenous ethnic groups===
Upon becoming president, Tolbert initiated some liberal reforms. Though he was re-elected in 1975, his government was criticized sharply for failing to address the deep economic disparities between different sectors of the population, notably the Americo-Liberians, who had dominated the country since independence, and the various indigenous ethnic groups which constituted the majority of the population.

Because Tolbert was a member of one of the most influential and affluent Americo-Liberian families, everything from cabinet appointments to economic policy was tainted with allegations of nepotism. Thanks to his father who spoke Kpelle, Tolbert was the second Liberian president, after President Stephen Allen Benson, to speak an indigenous language, and he promoted a program to bring more indigenous people into the government.

This initiative caused a good deal of chagrin among Americo-Liberians who accused Tolbert of &quot;letting the peasants into the kitchen.&quot; Indeed, it lacked support within Tolbert&#x27;s own administration. While the indigenous majority felt the change was occurring too slowly, many Americo-Liberians felt it was too rapid.

Despite following Tubman&#x27;s 27-year presidency, Tolbert refused to follow his predecessor&#x27;s hold on office until death. He successfully worked for a constitutional amendment to bar the president from serving more than eight years in office, and in 1976 he vowed fierce opposition to members of the Legislature who sought to repeal the amendment and again permit what Tolbert called an &quot;evil tradition&quot;. Three years later, when True Whig partisans petitioned him to seek the amendment&#x27;s repeal, he replied that their statement would only encourage him in his previous position: &quot;I will serve my country as long as I have life. I do not have to [be?] President to do so.&quot;

===Foreign policy===

Abandoning Tubman&#x27;s strong pro-West foreign policy, Tolbert adopted one which focused on promoting Liberia&#x27;s political independence. To this end, he established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, and several other Eastern Bloc countries, thus adopting a more nonaligned posture.

Sometime in 1974, Tolbert accepted aid from the Soviet Union for the first time. While he was president (1971–1980) Liberia&#x27;s relations with the United States strained because of the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviets and Eastern Bloc. Tolbert&#x27;s official state visit to the USA took place in 1976.

Tolbert severed Liberia&#x27;s ties with Israel during the Yom Kippur War in October 1973 and spoke in favor of recognizing national rights of the Palestinian people. However, Tolbert supported the United States on the Vietnam War, as had his predecessor, William Tubman. Tolbert was chairman of the Organisation of African Unity from July 1979 until he was killed in April 1980.

===Economy===
Throughout the 1970s, the world price of rubber was low, putting pressure on the Liberian economy. Tolbert brought a new approach to the Liberian government&#x27;s relations with foreign companies. Companies like Firestone, which had operated for years without being audited by the government, were audited and forced to pay millions of dollars in back taxes. Old concession agreements were renegotiated, and new concession agreements were negotiated with an emphasis on accountability of the private sector to the Liberian government.

In May 1975, Liberia became a signatory to the treaty that established the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in order to create a common market in West Africa and promote regional economic integration and stability in 15 West African countries, with the intention that it would mirror the success of the European Common Market.

By the late 1970s, Tolbert became increasingly open to overtures of economic assistance from Libya and Cuba.
===Return of a two-party system===

Liberia had been a one-party state since 1877. However, in 1973, the country returned to a two-party system when the Progressive Alliance of Liberia, headed by Gabriel Baccus Matthews, became recognized as a legitimate opposition party.

===Maryland County ritual killings===
Between 1965 and 1977 over 100 murders occurred around Harper in Maryland County, many of which involved mutilation and the removal of body parts. During the 1970s Liberians in Maryland County were constantly under the threat of ritual murders. Between November 1976 and July 1977, 14 people had disappeared in the county prompting Tolbert to fire the Superintendent of Maryland County, James Daniel Anderson, for failure to report the missing people and publicly declare &quot;Anyone who kills deliberately: The law will kill that person&quot;. Twelve suspects were eventually arrested; seven, including four government officials, were convicted and executed.

===Rice riots===
In early April 1979, Tolbert&#x27;s minister of agriculture, Florence Chenoweth, proposed an increase in the subsidized price of rice from $22 per 100-pound bag to $26. Chenoweth asserted that the increase would serve as an added inducement for rice farmers to continue farming instead of abandoning their farms for jobs in the cities or on the rubber plantations. Political opponents criticized the proposal as self-serving, pointing out that Chenoweth and the Tolbert family operated large rice farms and would therefore realize a tidy profit from the proposed price increase.

The Progressive Alliance of Liberia called for a peaceful demonstration in Monrovia to protest the proposed price increase. On 14 April about 2,000 activists began what was planned as a peaceful march on the Executive Mansion. The protest march swelled dramatically when the protesters were joined en route by more than 10,000 &quot;back street boys&quot; causing the march to quickly degenerate into a disorderly mob of riot and destruction. Widespread looting ensued with damage to private property estimated at over $40 million. At least 41 demonstrators were killed by shooting. This incident set fire to the powder. During the following year, riots and demonstrations shook the country. Tolbert tried in vain to restore order by arresting the opposition leaders, but his attempts were unsuccessful and the disorder increased. Tolbert&#x27;s credibility was severely damaged by the Rice Riots.

===Coup d&#x27;état and death===

In March 1980 Tolbert ordered the banning of the PAL, and had Gabriel Bacchus Matthews and the rest of the organization&#x27;s leadership arrested on charges of treason.

In the early hours of 12 April 1980, 17 non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia led by Master Sergeant Samuel Doe launched a violent coup d&#x27;état; all of them were &quot;indigenous&quot; Liberians who later became the founding members of the People&#x27;s Redemption Council, the governing body of the new regime. The group entered the Presidential palace and killed Tolbert, whose body was dumped into a mass grave together with 27 other victims of the coup. A crowd of angry Liberians gathered to shout insults and throw rocks at the bodies. Tolbert&#x27;s body was later moved to a spot in Monrovia&#x27;s Palm Grove Cemetery, not far from the bodies of those killed in the Rice Riots.

By the end of the month, most of the cabinet members of the Tolbert administration had been put on trial in a kangaroo court and sentenced to death. Many of them were publicly executed on 22 April at a beach near the Barclay Training Center in Monrovia. Only four of Tolbert&#x27;s cabinet heads survived the coup and its aftermath; among them was the minister of finance, future president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

===Accounts of Tolbert&#x27;s death===
Undisputedly, Tolbert was dead by the end of 12 April 1980, the day of the coup d&#x27;état. There are competing stories as to the time and manner of his death.

Steven Ellis, in his book &quot;Mask of Anarchy&quot;, says the president was found sleeping in his office, where the soldiers killed him, while Ellen Johnson Sirleaf&#x27;s biography, &quot;This Child Will Be Great&quot;, says Tolbert was seized and killed in his bed.

==Family==
Some of Tolbert&#x27;s children live in the US. His brother Stephen A. Tolbert served as his finance minister in the government until his death on 29 April 1975, in a plane crash. One of his sons, A. Benedict Tolbert, was killed in the aftermath of the coup: he had taken refuge in the French Embassy but was arrested by members of Doe&#x27;s security force who violated diplomatic immunity, and he was reportedly thrown out of a military aircraft while being transported to a prison in Lofa County.

Three of his daughters are no longer alive. Victoria Tolbert Yancy died in 1971, Evelyn Tolbert Richardson (the wife of a government aviator) died in Westchester County, New York, United States, in 1993. and Christine Augusta Tolbert-Norman died from cancer in Cary, North Carolina in 2021. His widow, former First Lady Victoria Tolbert, died in Minnesota on 8 November 1997 at the age of 81. She had moved to the United States after being released from house arrest in the aftermath of the coup. His grandson Tolbert Williams currently lives and works in the UK.

<doc id="277820" wikidata="Q2754884" url="?curid=277820" title="Tarantism">
<text>Tarantism ( ) is a form of hysteric behaviour originating in Southern Italy, popularly believed to result from the bite of the wolf spider &quot;Lycosa tarantula&quot; (distinct from the broad class of spiders also called tarantulas). A better candidate cause is &quot;Latrodectus tredecimguttatus&quot;, commonly known as the Mediterranean black widow or steppe spider, although no link between such bites and the behaviour of tarantism has ever been demonstrated. However, the term historically is used to refer to a dancing mania – characteristic of Southern Italy – which likely had little to do with spider bites. The tarantella dance supposedly evolved from a therapy for tarantism.

== History ==

It was originally described in the 11th century. The condition was common in Southern Italy, especially in the province of Taranto, during the 16th and 17th centuries. There were strong suggestions that there is no organic cause for the heightened excitability and restlessness that gripped the victims. The stated belief of the time was that victims needed to engage in frenzied dancing to prevent death from tarantism. Supposedly a particular kind of dance, called the tarantella, evolved from this therapy. A prime location for such outbursts was the church at Galatina, particularly at the time of the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul on 29 June. &quot;The dancing is placed under the sign of Saint Paul, whose chapel serves as a &quot;theatre&quot; for the tarantulees&#x27; public meetings. The spider seems constantly interchangeable with Saint Paul; the female tarantulees dress as &quot;brides of Saint Paul&quot;. As a climax, &quot;the tarantulees, after having danced for a long time, meet together in the chapel of Saint Paul and communally attain the paroxysm of their trance, ... the general and desperate agitation was dominated by the stylised cry of the tarantulees, the &#x27;crisis cry&#x27;, an &quot;ahiii&quot; uttered with various modulations&quot;.

Francesco Cancellieri, in his exhaustive treatise on Tarantism, takes note of semi-scientific, literary, and popular observations, both recent and ancient, giving each similar weight. He notes a report that in August 1693, a doctor in Naples had himself been bitten by two tarantulas, with six witnesses and a notary, but did not suffer the dancing illness. Cancellieri in part attributes this illness not only to the spiders but to the locale, since Tarantism was mainly seen in Basilicata, Apulia, Sicily, and Calabria. He states:

He goes on to describe some specific observations of the malady, typically afflicting peasants, alone or in groups. The malady typically affected peasants on hot summer days, causing indolence. Then he describes how only treatment through dancing music could restore them to vitality; for example:

==Interpretation and controversy==
John Crompton proposed that ancient Bacchanalian rites that had been suppressed by the Roman Senate in 186 BC went underground, reappearing under the guise of emergency therapy for bite victims. Although the popular belief persists that tarantism results from a spider bite, it remains scientifically unsubstantiated. Donaldson, Cavanagh, and Rankin (1997) conclude that the actual cause or causes of tarantism remain unknown.

==Modern times==
In recent years, tarantism has been defined by its connection to dance and music. In the 1990s and 2000s, people began rediscovering the genre of Tarantella, and in particular, the pizzica. In 1998, Salento began hosting an annual music festival, Notte della Taranta. Musicians tour throughout the region, and the festival culminates with a large late-night concert held in Melpignano. Composer and musician, Ludovico Einaudi directed the festival in 2010 and 2011, and released his album Taranta Project in 2015. 

==Cultural references==
Many historical and cultural references are associated with this disease and the ensuing &quot;cure&quot; – the tarantella. It is, for example, a key image in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; and the spell &quot;Tarantallegra&quot; from the Harry Potter series. It was also mentioned in the novel &quot;39 Clues: Superspecial Outbreak&quot;.
The mention of the spider &quot;tarantula&quot; and description of its venom and the associated addiction has been depicted in the Indian television show &quot;Byomkesh Bakshi&quot; in episode 4 titled &quot;Makdi ka Ras/makorshar rawsh&quot;.

<doc id="277824" wikidata="Q127152" url="?curid=277824" title="Hysteria (Def Leppard album)">
<text>Hysteria is the fourth studio album by English rock band Def Leppard, released on 3 August 1987, by Mercury Records. The album is the follow-up to the band&#x27;s 1983 breakthrough, &quot;Pyromania&quot;. &quot;Hysteria&quot;″s creation took over three years and was plagued by delays, including the aftermath of drummer Rick Allen&#x27;s accident that cost him his left arm on 31 December 1984. Subsequent to the album&#x27;s release, Def Leppard published a book titled &quot;Animal Instinct: The Def Leppard Story&quot;, written by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine senior editor David Fricke, on the three-year recording process of &quot;Hysteria&quot; and the difficult times the band endured through the mid-1980s. Lasting 62 minutes and 32 seconds, it is the band&#x27;s longest studio album to date.
&quot;Hysteria&quot; was the band&#x27;s third album to be produced by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange. The title of the album was conceived by Allen referring to his car accident, the amputation of his arm, and the ensuing worldwide media coverage surrounding it. It is the last album to feature guitarist Steve Clark before his death in 1991, although songs co-written by him would appear on the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Adrenalize&quot; (1992).

Although initial sales stalled outside the band&#x27;s devoted fanbase, it soon became a worldwide commercial success, reaching number one on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the UK Albums Chart. It is Def Leppard&#x27;s best-selling album to date, selling over 20 million copies worldwide, including 12 million in the US, and spawned seven hit singles. It remains one of the best-selling albums of all time.

==History==
Soon after completing the &quot;Pyromania&quot; tour in February 1984, the band commenced writing and pre-production for what became &quot;Hysteria&quot; in Dublin, using Fostex 4-track cassette recorders to capture ideas. Early sketches of &quot;Animal&quot;, &quot;Gods Of War&quot; and &quot;Armageddon It&quot; were developed during this period. Lange joined them to help with writing and arrangements, but at late notice informed the group he could not commit to producing the album due to burnout from a gruelling schedule from the past few years. Thus, they had to find another producer who was available and they went with Jim Steinman.

Sessions with Steinman began at Wisseloord Studios on 11 August 1984, with Neil Dorfsman as engineer. However, it became clear that Steinman was not the right producer for them, that his standards were not as high as Lange&#x27;s: Steinman&#x27;s intention to make a raw-sounding record that captured the moment conflicted with the band&#x27;s interest in creating a bigger, more pristine pop production. As singer Joe Elliott observed, &quot;[Steinman] wouldn&#x27;t adapt and we wouldn&#x27;t compromise&quot;, and by October 1984 Steinman was ousted from the project. Dorfsman could not see the album through as he had commitments to work with Dire Straits on what became &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; – he would later mention that they &quot;barely [had] drums and bass on seven songs&quot; after three months of work.

After parting ways with Steinman and scrapping the material from those sessions, the band tried to produce the album themselves with Lange&#x27;s engineer Nigel Green. However, as Steve Clark recalled, &quot;it was very slow work because we didn&#x27;t have any sort of headmaster there, and we had to try everything five different ways.&quot;

On 31 December 1984, Rick Allen lost his left arm when his Corvette (C4) flipped off a country road. Following the accident, the band stood by Allen&#x27;s decision to return to the drum kit despite his disability, using a combination electronic/acoustic kit with a set of electronic pedals that triggered (via MIDI) the sounds that he would have played with his left arm. The band slowly continued production until Lange returned in the summer of 1985 for vocal sessions in Paris. However, Lange soon felt that the material recorded so far (which ended up sounding close to &quot;Pyromania&quot;) needed work, leading to another 18 months in the studio. However, the sessions were further delayed by Lange&#x27;s own auto accident (sustaining leg injuries from which he quickly recovered) and a bout of the mumps suffered by singer Joe Elliott in late 1986.

&quot;Hysteria&quot; was recorded in a piecemeal way like the previous two albums, with individual parts (or notes, even) being recorded separately. The guitars were recorded first to a LinnDrum click track, which gave Lange and the band the flexibility to re-write and re-record parts of the song as they went along. Then, once the arrangements were finalised, the bass and drums were added towards the end of the recording.

The final recording sessions took place in January 1987 for the song &quot;Armageddon It&quot; and a last-minute composition &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me&quot;, though Lange spent another three months mixing the tracks. The album was finally released worldwide on 3 August 1987, with &quot;Animal&quot; as the lead single in most countries except for the US and Canada where &quot;Women&quot; was the first single.

==Concept==
The album&#x27;s goal, set out by Lange, was to be a hard rock version of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;, in that every track was a potential hit single. Songs were therefore written with this concept in mind, disappointing heavy metal fans who clamoured for a straight sequel to the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Pyromania&quot;. One song, &quot;Love Bites&quot;, was already mostly written in the vein of a country ballad by Mutt Lange when he brought it to the band&#x27;s attention.

While &quot;Pyromania&quot; contained traces of Def Leppard&#x27;s original traditional heavy metal sound found on their first two albums, &quot;Hysteria&quot; removed them in favour of the latest sonic technology available at the time (best displayed on &quot;Rocket&quot;, &quot;Love Bites&quot;, &quot;Excitable&quot;, and &quot;Gods of War&quot;). As with &quot;Pyromania&quot;, every song was recorded by every member in the studio separately instead of the whole band. The multiple vocal harmonies were enhanced by Lange&#x27;s techniques, even pitching background vocals on all tracks. Guitar parts were now more focused on emphasising melody rather than hard rock riffing.

The band used the Rockman amplifier, developed by guitarist Tom Scholz from the rock band Boston, to record the album. Engineer Mike Shipley described the Rockman as &quot;a shitty little box&quot; with &quot;a godawful sound&quot; that &quot;had no real balls to it&quot;, but it was used because the other amplifiers used had an excessively &quot;crunchy&quot; sound ill-suited to layering guitars and which Lange did not think was &quot;commercial&quot; enough.

In addition, all of the album&#x27;s drum sounds were samples recorded by Lange and the engineers, then played from the Fairlight CMI. In a 1999 interview with &quot;Mix&quot; magazine, Shipley noted, &quot;&quot;Pyromania&quot; was done the same way, on cheesy 8-bit Fairlight technology where we had to figure out how to record everything at half speed into the Fairlight to make it sound like it had some tone to it, and we&#x27;d be stacking up a bunch of snares and bass drums.&quot; Shipley also noted that the drum sounds were dealt with last because each song&#x27;s structure could change so radically, and because of technical difficulties. This unique approach sometimes led to painstaking lengths of time in the recording studio.

The smash single, &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me&quot;, was the last song written but was quickly finished within two weeks. In sharp contrast, the final version of &quot;Animal&quot; took almost a full three years to be developed but was not as successful as other singles, only reaching number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Commercial performance==
David Simone, managing director of Phonogram Records at the time, said the album might have been the most expensive record made in the UK. According to guitarist Phil Collen, the album had to sell a minimum of 5 million copies to break even.

The popularity of Def Leppard in their homeland had significantly grown over the previous four years, and &quot;Hysteria&quot; topped the charts in Britain in its first week of release. The album was also a major success in other parts of Europe. In the US, however, the band initially struggled to regain the momentum of &quot;Pyromania&quot; that was lost from such a prolonged absence. The leadoff track, &quot;Women&quot;, was selected as the first single for the US and Canada, instead of &quot;Animal&quot;, in July 1987. Then-manager Cliff Burnstein reasoned that the band needed to reconnect with their hard rock audience first before issuing more top 40-friendly singles. &quot;Women&quot; became a top ten hit on the rock chart, peaking at number seven, but as predicted, did not make a large impact on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 80.

The success of the album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me&quot; would propel the album to the top of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart on 23 July 1988, nearly a year after its release – topping the chart three separate times for a combined total of six weeks. Seven singles were eventually released in the United States, with &quot;Love Bites&quot; reaching number one, and three others reaching the top ten. The singles earned similar success in the United Kingdom. In the &quot;Billboard&quot; issue dated 8 October 1988, Def Leppard held the number one spot on both the singles and album charts with &quot;Love Bites&quot; and &quot;Hysteria&quot;, respectively.

&quot;Hysteria&quot; went on to dominate album charts around the world for three years. It was certified 12× platinum by the RIAA in 1998. The album currently sits as the 51st best selling album of all time in the US. It spent 96 weeks in the US top 40, a record for the 1980s it ties with &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; The album has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide.

Speaking to &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in May 2008 about the album&#x27;s success, Joe Elliott remembered:
For us the first album showed promise, the second showed the true reality of where we were going, the third album worked better in America than it did in England simply because there was no exposure radio-wise over here but by the time we did &quot;Hysteria&quot;, everything had fallen into place. Airplay and hit singles were one aspect of it but there was also all the hard work we put into the album – we literally did slave over it to get every sound on it right. There was also Rick&#x27;s accident, of course, and to be honest, I&#x27;m sure there was the initial wave of sympathy but I&#x27;m equally sure the album would have still worked anyway. None of the other stuff – the touring, the promotion, the videos – none of that would have meant anything if the songs hadn&#x27;t been there and I&#x27;m still really proud of all the songs on &quot;Hysteria&quot;.
On 24 October 2006, a 2-CD &quot;deluxe edition&quot; of the album was released, including a remastering of the original b-sides and bonus tracks from the album&#x27;s period. These songs include &quot;Tear It Down&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be Your Hero&quot;, &quot;Ride Into The Sun&quot; (originally released in 1979 on &quot;The Def Leppard E.P.&quot;) and &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;. Many of these songs, alongside two other &quot;Hysteria&quot; compositions &quot;Desert Song&quot; and &quot;Fractured Love&quot;, had been featured on &quot;Retro Active&quot;, albeit with remixes, revamps, and new parts added. The deluxe edition &quot;Hysteria&quot; CD included the original b-side versions of these recordings without alterations.

Another song, &quot;Tonight&quot; was originally recorded on 5 May 1988 during a break in the Hysteria World Tour as a possible b-side to one of the album&#x27;s upcoming singles. The song was shelved and later re-recorded for the &quot;Adrenalize&quot; album (along with &quot;Stand Up (Kick Love into Motion)&quot;, which was deemed too similar to the album&#x27;s title track. The 1988 demo version, which includes Steve Clark on guitar, was eventually released on various CD singles, album deluxe editions and box sets.

Finally, a very tongue in cheek cover of &quot;Release Me&quot; which was made famous by Engelbert Humperdinck in 1967 was released as a b-side under the guise of Stumpus Maximus and the Good Ol&#x27; Boys. Stumpus Maximus was Malvin Mortimer, a member of the band&#x27;s road crew who later became their tour manager. The Good Ol&#x27; Boys were the members of Def Leppard, singing backup on what is essentially a parody version of the song.

During their 22 March to 10 April 2013 residency at The Joint, Def Leppard performed the album in its entirety, from start to finish. This was followed up with a live album &quot;Viva! Hysteria&quot;, recorded during the residency and released on 22 October 2013, which includes all of band&#x27;s fourth studio album being played live.

This would be followed up seven years later as &quot;Hysteria: Live at the O2&quot; was released on 29 May 2020, as part of the &quot;London to Vegas&quot; box set. The live concert was filmed at The O2 Arena in London, England on 6 December 2018, as the band once again played the album in its entirety. Various releases have included a stand-alone edition of this concert have featured combinations of audio, DVD and blu-ray discs.

In the liner notes to the album, the band apologized for the long wait between albums, and promised to never force fans to wait that long between albums again. However, later events, particularly the death of lead guitarist Steve Clark, delayed the next album, &quot;Adrenalize&quot;, by almost five years.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Hysteria&quot; received generally positive reviews. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey awarded it five stars, stating, &quot;&quot;Pyromania&quot;″s slick, layered Mutt Lange production turned into a painstaking obsession with dense sonic detail on &quot;Hysteria&quot;, with the result that some critics dismissed the record as a stiff, mechanized pop sell-out (perhaps due in part to Rick Allen&#x27;s new, partially electronic drum kit).&quot; Huey characterized the album as &quot;pop metal&quot; rather than heavy metal, with reference to the production of Mutt Lange, and called it &quot;arguably the best pop-metal album ever recorded&quot;.

In 2005, &quot;Hysteria&quot; was ranked number 464 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Hysteria&quot; got the same placement on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 best albums of all time, the magazine also ranked the album atop its list of the 50 greatest hair metal albums, and they placed the album on their list of &quot;50 Rock Albums Every Country Fan Should Own&quot;.
&quot;Loudwire&quot; placed the album at number two on their list of the top 30 hair metal albums. &quot;Hysteria&quot; was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot; and &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; both ranked the album number eight on their Hair Metal album lists. &quot;Metal Rules&quot; put the album on their list of the Top 50 Glam Metal Albums, at number 30. &quot;The Ringer&quot; called &quot;Hysteria&quot; &quot;the greatest hair-metal album ever made&quot;.

&quot;I can say objectively – because I wasn&#x27;t in the band then – that &quot;Hysteria&quot; is one of the greatest records of all time,&quot; remarked Leppard guitarist Vivian Campbell.

; Notes 
* *Mislabeled as &quot;Lunar Mix (radio edit)&quot;, this is a rare promo mix edited from the album version. It differs heavily from the actual Lunar Mix radio edit, which contains elements from both the album version and the full-length Lunar Mix and cuts the second verse in half. The version used for the music video and for &quot;&quot; significantly shortens the bridge section of the Lunar Mix radio edit.

<doc id="277825" wikidata="Q324617" url="?curid=277825" title="Tarantella">
<text>&#x27; () is a group of various southern Italian folk dances originating in the regions of Calabria, Campania, Sicilia and Puglia. It is characterized by a fast upbeat tempo, usually in time (sometimes or ), accompanied by tambourines. It is among the most recognized forms of traditional southern Italian music. The specific dance-name varies with every region, for instance &quot;Sonu a ballu&quot; in Calabria, &quot;tammurriata&quot; in Campania, and &quot;pizzica&quot; in Salento. Tarantella is popular in Southern Italy, Greece and Malta. The term may appear as &#x27; in a linguistically masculine construction.

== History ==

The nowadays southern part of Italy was not part of a single country until the mid to late 19th century. The place was a colony of ancient Greece, and even Napoli (&quot;Naples&quot;) comes from the Greek word &quot;Neapolis&quot;, which means &quot;New City&quot;. Before the Unification of Italy, it was part of the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily (&quot;Sikelia&quot; is the original name of this island as a colony of Ancient Greece), and later the Kingdom of Two Sicilies when the two reigns merged. Before the Unification of Italy, it was ruled by Spain and briefly by Austria. There was the ancient Greek city of Tarantas found by Spartans.

In the Italian province of Taranto (taking its name from Tarantas), Apulia, the bite of a locally common type of wolf spider, Lycosa tarantula (&quot;Lycos&quot; in Greek means &quot;wolf&quot;), named &quot;tarantula&quot; after the region, was popularly believed to be highly venomous and to lead to a hysterical condition known as tarantism. This type of dance became known as the &quot;tarantella&quot;. R. Lowe Thompson proposed that the dance is a survival from a &quot;Dianic or Dionysiac cult&quot;, driven underground. John Compton later proposed that the Roman Senate had suppressed these ancient Bacchanalian rites. In 186 BC, the &quot;tarantella&quot; went underground, reappearing under the guise of emergency therapy for bite victims.

==Courtship versus tarantism dances==
The stately courtship &quot;tarantella&quot; danced by a couple or couples, short in duration, is graceful and elegant and features characteristic music. On the other hand, the supposedly curative or symptomatic &quot;tarantella&quot; was danced solo by a victim of a &quot;Lycosa tarantula&quot; spider bite (not to be confused with what is commonly known as a tarantula today); it was agitated in character, lasted for hours or even up to days, and featured characteristic music. However, other forms of the dance were and still are dances of couples usually either mimicking courtship or a sword fight. The confusion appears to derive from the fact that the spiders, the condition, its sufferers (&quot;tarantolati&quot;), and the dances all have names similar to the city of Taranto.

The dance originated in the Apulia region, and spread throughout the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The Neapolitan &quot;tarantella&quot; is a courtship dance performed by couples whose &quot;rhythms, melodies, gestures, and accompanying songs are quite distinct&quot; featuring faster more cheerful music. Its origins may further lie in &quot;a fifteenth-century fusion between the Spanish Fandango and the Moresque &quot;ballo di sfessartia&quot;&quot;. The &quot;magico-religious&quot; &quot;tarantella&quot; is a solo dance performed supposedly to cure through perspiration the delirium and contortions attributed to the bite of a spider at harvest (summer) time. The dance was later applied as a supposed cure for the behavior of neurotic women (&quot;carnevaletto delle donne&quot;).

There are several traditional tarantella groups: Cantori di Carpino, Officina Zoé, Uccio Aloisi gruppu, Canzoniere Grecanico Salentino, Selva Cupina, I Tamburellisti di Torrepaduli.

The &quot;tarantella&quot; is most frequently played with a mandolin, a guitar, an accordion and tambourines; flute, fiddle, trumpet and clarinet are also used.

The &quot;tarantella&quot; is a dance in which the dancer and the drum player constantly try to upstage each other by playing faster or dancing longer than the other, subsequently tiring one person out first.

==Tarantism==

Tarantism, as a ritual, is supposed to have roots in the ancient myths. Reportedly, victims who had collapsed or were convulsing would begin to dance with appropriate music and be revived as if a tarantula had bitten them. The music used to treat dancing mania appears to be similar to that used in the case of tarantism though little is known about either. Justus Hecker (1795–1850), describes in his work &quot;Epidemics of the Middle Ages&quot;: A convulsion infuriated the human frame [...]. Entire communities of people would join hands, dance, leap, scream, and shake for hours [...]. Music appeared to be the only means of combating the strange epidemic [...] lively, shrill tunes, played on trumpets and fifes, excited the dancers; soft, calm harmonies, graduated from fast to slow, high to low, prove efficacious for the cure. The music used against spider bites featured drums and clarinets, was matched to the pace of the victim, and is only weakly connected to its later depiction in the &quot;tarantellas&quot; of Chopin, Liszt, Rossini, and Heller.

While most serious proponents speculated as to the direct physical benefits of the dancing rather than the power of the music, a mid-18th century medical textbook gets the prevailing story backwards, describing that tarantulas will be compelled to dance by violin music. It was thought that the &quot;Lycosa tarantula&quot; wolf spider had lent the name &quot;tarantula&quot; to an unrelated family of spiders, having been the species associated with Taranto, but since &quot;L. tarantula&quot; is not inherently deadly, the highly venomous Mediterranean black widow, &quot;Latrodectus tredecimguttatus&quot;, may have been the species originally associated with Taranto&#x27;s manual grain harvest.

<text>The University of Tirana (, abbreviated UT) is a public university located at the central borough of Tirana 10 in Tirana, Albania. It was established as the State University of Tirana (SUT) in 1957 through merging of five existing institutes of higher education.

The main building was planned by Italian architect, Gherardo Bosio at the beginning of 1940. It is situated at the Mother Teresa Square, south of the city center of Tirana.

The primary language of instruction is Albanian, but there are a number of faculties of foreign languages which are carried out in English, French, Greek, Italian, Spanish, German, Chinese and other languages.

The University of Tirana was founded in 1957 as the &quot;State University of Tirana&quot; (), through the merging of five existing institutes of higher education, the most important of which was the Institute of Sciences, founded in 1947. Immediately after the death of Enver Hoxha in 1985, the university was renamed the &quot;Enver Hoxha University of Tirana&quot; () until 1992.

==Academics and size==
The university is the largest and highest ranking university in Albania. It includes eight colleges, 50 academic departments, and 41 study programs or majors. Most programs are offered in Tirana; a few smaller affiliated campuses are located in other Albanian cities, including Saranda in the southern part of the country and Kukës in the north. It offers three-year Bachelor, one- or two-year Master, and three- to five-year doctorate degree programs, in accordance with the Bologna system.

The current campus is urban and decentralised. A new large and centralised campus has been planned in the southeast periphery of Tirana. Students dorms are grouped in a separate location called Student City (Qyteti Studenti) in southeast Tirana.

UT is the biggest university in Albania, and among the biggest in Europe with 35,000 students. In 2013 the college accepted 95 new Ph.D. students. These are students in possession of bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

<text>Adrenalize is the fifth studio album by English rock band Def Leppard, released on 30 March 1992 through Mercury Records. It is the first album by the band recorded without guitarist Steve Clark, who died in 1991, although most songs were written and partially demoed before his death, they were re-recorded solo by Phil Collen in 1991-1992. It is the only album recorded by Def Leppard as a four-member band. Spawning seven singles, four of them – &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Rocked&quot;, &quot;Make Love Like a Man&quot;, &quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad&quot;, and &quot;Stand Up (Kick Love into Motion)&quot; – were major hits.

&quot;Tear It Down&quot; is a re-recording of a song written during a recording session following the completion of the &quot;Hysteria&quot; album, and released as B-side for that album&#x27;s single &quot;Women&quot; in 1987. The song received radio airplay and was performed by the band live at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards.

&quot;White Lightning&quot; is dedicated to the memory of Clark, who has writing credits on six of the album&#x27;s ten tracks.

==Background==
Def Leppard had faced long delays, and the challenge of drummer Rick Allen losing his arm while making their previous album, &quot;Hysteria&quot;, and while trying to follow up the success, they also faced the prospect of doing so with a different producer, as Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange was already working with Bryan Adams. At the same time guitarist Steve Clark had been suffering from alcohol addiction since 1989, spending six sessions in rehab. Clark was involved in writing six of the songs on the album, but was given an ultimatum over his alcoholism in September 1990, and put on a six-month leave of absence. Clark died four months later, in January 1991.

The band tried to continue the recording process, going back into the studio the day after Clark&#x27;s death to cope with the loss, but it took a few months before they were able to work to what they felt was a satisfactory standard.

==Recording==
Instead of replacing Clark with a new member, the band recorded the album as a four-piece. &quot;We had recorded demos on multitrack,&quot; recalled fellow guitarist Phil Collen. &quot;I was sitting there with him when he played the original parts. I could relay that. But it was like playing along to a ghost.&quot;

This was also the band&#x27;s first album since 1980&#x27;s &quot;On Through the Night&quot; not to be produced by Lange. Instead, the band took matters in their own hands and produced the album themselves along with longtime engineer Mike Shipley; with Lange credited as executive producer.

&quot;We coped without Mutt quite well…&quot; recalled Joe Elliott. &quot;Mutt was in his studio in Guildford with Bryan Adams and we&#x27;d be in Dublin, talking every day… But it wasn&#x27;t as adventurous as &quot;Hysteria&quot;. It was more of a rock album, less experimental. It&#x27;s like with Pink Floyd: to me, &quot;Adrenalize&quot; was our &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Hysteria&quot; was our &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.&quot;

==Commercial performance and reception==
&quot;Adrenalize&quot; debuted at No. 1 on both the UK Albums Chart and, in the following week, on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It stayed at No. 1 of the Billboard chart for five weeks keeping Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Human Touch&quot; off the top spot, and spent 65 weeks on the charts in total. 

The album received mixed reviews: some critics praised its production values and instantly catchy and radio-friendly material, while others called it tired and formulaic. In a four-star review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, J.D. Considine wrote: &quot;&quot;Adrenalize&quot; is so relentlessly catchy that it almost seems as if the band is about to abandon its heavy-metal roots for the greener fields of hard pop.&quot; Other reviewers also noted the album&#x27;s less metal sound and pointed out its lack of cohesion. A staff writer for Sputnikmusic said that, despite the slick production, the album doesn&#x27;t match the standard set by the band&#x27;s previous two records, which they referred to as masterpieces.&quot; 

Writing in 2009, after &quot;Pyromania&quot; and &quot;Adrenalize&quot; have been reissued, Toby Cook of &quot;The Quietus&quot; said that, despite &quot;Adrenalize&quot;&#x27;s many flaws, &quot;the record buying public of &#x27;92 cared not.&quot; Indeed, the album would go on to sell more than seven million copies worldwide, remaining Def Leppard&#x27;s last studio album to achieve major mainstream success.

<doc id="277829" wikidata="Q375748" url="?curid=277829" title="Sid Abel">
<text>Sidney Gerald Abel (February 22, 1918February 8, 2000) was a Canadian Hall of Fame hockey player, coach and general manager in the National Hockey League, most notably for the Detroit Red Wings, and was a member of Stanley Cup-winning teams in 1943, 1950, and 1952. In 2017, Abel was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history.

==Playing career==
Born in Melville, Saskatchewan, Abel, or &quot;Old Bootnose&quot; as he was known, played junior hockey with the Flin Flon Bombers and joined the Red Wings in 1938. He split the next two seasons between the Red Wings and their affiliates in the International-American Hockey League before becoming a full-time player in 1940. He was named captain of the Red Wings in 1942.

In 1943, Abel left the Red Wings to serve with the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. During this time, he skated with the RCAF team in Montreal. Abel was demobilized late in the 1946 season; he rejoined the Red Wings just in time for the playoffs and regained the team captaincy.

In 1947, Red Wings&#x27; coach Jack Adams placed Abel and Ted Lindsay on a forward line with rookie right winger Gordie Howe. Although Abel was slowed down by an attack of pleurisy late that season, the line led the team to a playoff berth. The following season, Lindsay, Abel, and Howe finished first, third, and fourth respectively, in team scoring, and led the Red Wings to the Stanley Cup Finals.

By the 1949 season, the newly dubbed &quot;Production Line&quot; led the Wings to the first of seven consecutive first-place finishes, an NHL record still standing today. However, Howe and Lindsay were hampered by severe injuries that cost them much playing time. Abel was tied with Lindsay for third in NHL scoring and led the league in goals, and he recorded career highs in goals and assists. He was awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player, and was named to the First All-Star team.

The next three seasons saw Abel lead the Production Line over all other forward lines in points, and in 1949-50 Lindsay, Abel, and Howe finished in the top three in league scoring, equalling the feat of the famed &quot;Kraut Line&quot; of the Boston Bruins in 1939-40. In 1950, Abel was again named to the First All-Star team and won his second Stanley Cup, and in 1950, he was named Second Team All-Star.

Abel was sold to the Chicago Black Hawks in 1952, and was named coach of his new team. He served as player-coach for the next two seasons, the last full-time player-head coach in NHL history.

Though his No. 12 was honored by the Wings, Abel also wore 4, 7, 9, 12, 14, 19, and 20 throughout his career. He wore most of these numbers during his first two seasons, when he split time between the Red Wings and the minors, before settling on number 12. He wore 9 after his return from the RCAF at the end of the 1945–46 season, as Joe Carveth had taken 12 during Abel&#x27;s military service, and Abel regained 12 in 1946 when Carveth was traded to the Boston Bruins.

==Coaching==
Abel was the head coach of the Chicago Black Hawks for two seasons from 1952 to 1954. He returned to the Red Wings in 1957–58 and served as Detroit&#x27;s head coach through the 1969–70 season. Abel also served as the Red Wings&#x27; general manager from April 1962 to January 1971.

In 1974 Abel was named general manager of the expansion Kansas City Scouts and served through the 1975–76 season, after which the franchise relocated to Denver to become the Colorado Rockies. Abel served as coach of the Scouts for three games in 1975-76 following the resignation of Bep Guidolin.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Abel worked as a colour commentator on Red Wings radio and television broadcasts beside play-by-play announcer Bruce Martyn.

==Legacy==

Sid Abel was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1969. In 1998, he was ranked 85 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.
Abel&#x27;s older brother George played for Canada&#x27;s hockey team at the 1952 Olympics in Oslo, Norway. George scored the winning goal in the final game, securing the only gold medal for Canada that year. Sid&#x27;s son Gerry played briefly in the NHL, and his grandson Brent Johnson is a goaltender who played several years in the NHL. Sid&#x27;s son-in-law Bob Johnson was also a goaltender in the NHL.

Abel died on February 8, 2000, fourteen days before his 82nd birthday.

<doc id="277833" wikidata="Q312038" url="?curid=277833" title="Phoneutria">
<text>Phoneutria is a genus of spiders in the family Ctenidae. They are mainly found in northern South America, with one species in Central America. Members of the genus are commonly referred to as Brazilian wandering spiders. Other English names include armed spiders (&quot;armadeiras&quot; in Brazilian Portuguese) and banana spiders (a name shared with several others).

==Description==
The spiders in the genus can grow to have a leg span of . Their body length ranges from . While some other araneomorph spiders have a longer leg span, the largest &quot;Phoneutria&quot; species have the longest body and the greatest body weight in this group. The genus is distinguished from other related genera such as &quot;Ctenus&quot; by the presence of dense prolateral scopulae (a dense brush of fine hairs) on the pedipalp tibiae and tarsi in both sexes. &quot;Phoneutria&quot; are easily confused with several other non-medically significant ctenids, especially &quot;Cupiennius&quot;, in which the recently described &quot;C. chiapanensis&quot; also has bright red hairs on the chelicerae. Additionally, some &quot;Phoneutria&quot; species lack red hairs on the chelicerae, making it an unreliable identification feature. The presence of a dark linear stripe or stripes on the frontal (dorsal) palps and presence of a single thin black line running anterior-posterior along the dorsal carapace may help identify &quot;Phoneutria&quot;. Other features are the strong ventral marking on the underside of the legs with contrasting dark mid-segments and lighter joints, and the pattern on the ventral (underside) of the abdomen with several rows of black dots, or an overall reddish colour.

The characteristic defensive posture with frontal legs held high is an especially good indicator to confirm a specimen is &quot;Phoneutria&quot;, especially alongside correct colour patterns. During the defensive display the body is lifted up into an erect position, the first two pairs of legs are lifted high (revealing the conspicuous black/light-banded pattern on the leg underside), while the spider sways from side to side with hind legs in a cocked position.

==Taxonomy==

The genus &quot;Phoneutria&quot; was started by Maximilian Perty in 1833. The genus name is from the Greek φονεύτρια, meaning &quot;murderess&quot;. Perty placed two species in the genus: &quot;Phoneutria rufibarbis&quot; and &quot;Phoneutria fera&quot;. The former is treated as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;; the latter is the type species of the genus.

===Species===

, the World Spider Catalog accepted the following species:
*&quot;Phoneutria bahiensis&quot; – Brazil
*&quot;Phoneutria boliviensis&quot; – Central, South America
*&quot;Phoneutria depilata&quot; – Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador
*&quot;Phoneutria eickstedtae&quot; – Brazil
*&quot;Phoneutria fera&quot; (type) – Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Suriname, Guyana
*&quot;Phoneutria keyserlingi&quot; – Brazil
*&quot;Phoneutria nigriventer&quot; – Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina
*&quot;Phoneutria pertyi&quot; – Brazil
*&quot;Phoneutria reidyi&quot; – Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Brazil, Guyana

==Behaviour==
Wandering spiders are so-called because they wander the jungle floor at night, rather than residing in a lair or maintaining a web. During the day they hide inside termite mounds, under fallen logs and rocks, and in banana plants (hence the &quot;banana spider&quot; nickname) and bromeliads. &quot;P. nigriventer&quot; is known to hide in dark and moist places in or near human dwellings.

&quot;P. nigriventer&quot; mates during the dry season from April to June, which leads to frequent observations of the species during this time.

==Distribution==
&quot;Phoneutria&quot; are found in forests from Costa Rica southwards throughout South America east of the Andes including Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and into northern Argentina. Three species (&quot;P. reidyi, P. boliviensis and P. fera&quot;) are found in the Amazon region, one species (&quot;P. fera&quot;) is restricted to the Amazon, and one (&quot;P. depilata)&quot; ranges into Central America in Panama and Costa Rica. The remaining species are restricted to Atlantic Forest of Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil, including forest fragments in the Cerrado savanna. In Brazil, &quot;Phoneutria&quot; is only absent in the northeastern region north of Salvador, Bahia.

&quot;Phoneutria&quot; has been introduced to Chile and Uruguay.

=== Banana shipments ===
These spiders acquired their other common name, &quot;banana spider&quot;, because it is claimed that they are occasionally found in shipments of bananas, though the number of reports is exaggerated due to common misidentifications of unrelated spiders. A survey of spiders found in international shipments to North America revealed that only 7 of 135 spiders were &quot;Phoneutria&quot; species, six being &quot;Phoneutria boliviensis&quot; from bananas and one &quot;Phoneutria nigriventer&quot; from a shipment of electrical parts. Spiders from genera such as &quot;Cupiennius&quot; had been misidentified by experienced arachnologists. Cases continue to be reported but without evidence of expert identification. In 2005, a man was bitten in Bridgwater, England by a spider in a shipment of bananas and, in 2014, a south London family photographed a spider that they claim was in a bunch of bananas delivered to their home.

==Medical significance==

The genus &quot;Phoneutria&quot; includes some of the relatively few species of spiders known to present a threat to humans. Danger to humans does not only comprise toxicity, but also factors such as the spider&#x27;s capacity to deliver a sufficient dose of venom, a disposition that makes a bite likely, and proximity to human habitation. These spiders&#x27; wandering nature is another reason they are considered so dangerous. In densely populated areas, &quot;Phoneutria&quot; species usually search for cover and dark places to hide during daytime, leading them to hide in houses, clothes, cars, boots, boxes and log piles, where they may bite if accidentally disturbed.

Spider mouthparts are adapted to envenomate very small prey; they are not well-adapted to attacking large mammals such as humans. Some believe that various spiders like &quot;Phoneutria&quot;, that use venom mainly to kill prey, can deliver a &quot;dry&quot; bite in defense to purposely conserve their venom, as opposed to a more primitive spider like &quot;Atrax&quot; that usually delivers a full load. A study in March 2009 suggests that &quot;Phoneutria&quot; inject venom in approximately one-third of their bites, and only a small quantity in one-third of those cases. Another study similarly suggested that only 2.3% of bites (mainly in children) were serious enough to require antivenom. Research in this area is hindered by the difficulty of identifying particular species. Nevertheless, there are a few well-attested instances of death. In one case, a single spider killed two children in São Sebastião. The spider was positively identified as a &quot;Phoneutria&quot; by Wolfgang Bücherl. Fatalities are usually attributed to respiratory arrest, secondary to systemic effects, or directly to envenoming. Systemic effects occur in 9% to 27% of cases; symptoms at the sites are more frequent, occurring from 83% to 96% of cases. The severity of the cases can be related to the sex of the spider, since the male produces less venom and is less lethal than the females, except for &quot;P. boliviensis&quot;, where the male is more toxic. Symptoms may appear within 10 to 20 minutes after the bite, and death within two to six hours, where severe pain radiates to the rest of the limb, systemic effects include tachycardia, increased blood pressure, vertigo, fever, sweating, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing and paralysis. Death is usually caused by respiratory arrest. These spiders seem to produce a smaller amount of venom during cold months (June to September) a minimum amount of 0.03 mg, an average of 0.44 mg and a maximum of 1.84 mg, during the summer months. The maximum amount among individuals was 3.10 mg (October 26), 4 mg (November 3), 5 mg (November 4) and 8 mg (October 31); 7 mg of dried venom is enough to kill 500 mice subcutaneously and 1,000 intravenously.

&quot;P. nigriventer&quot; is the species responsible for most cases of envenomation in Brazil because it is commonly found in highly populated areas of southeastern Brazil, such as the states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo. 

== Reported cases ==
A 45-year-old man, with no nervous background, employed in the agricultural section of the Butantan Institute, working barefoot, was bitten at 10:40 AM on the small toe of his left foot by a medium-sized &quot;Phoneutria&quot;. Immediately he felt intense pain that radiated to his foot and leg. He also reported visual disturbances, and when he tried to enter the building, he fell. Without strength, he was supported by two men to the laboratory, where he was examined. He could not stand, had difficulty seeing, difficulty talking (he could not answer questions), and complained of severe general pain and intense cold. He was sweating profusely, there was hyper nasal secretion and salivation, which made him blow his nose and spit constantly. He was agitated, with generalized tremors and continuous cramps in his left foot and leg, and an irregular pulse with 112 beats per minute. An hour after the accident, the serum was injected into the left buttock. During the next hour, the pulse became faster, thready, almost uncountable, and the temperature decreased, with a worsening of the general condition. At noon the victim received a new injection of serum and by 1:00 pm there was improvement.

In another case, a 22-year-old woman, four months pregnant, was bitten on the hand. She experienced severe generalized pain with paroxysm, had difficulty keeping up and talking, moaned, had cramps, generalized tremors, excessive sweating, and rapid pulse (140–150 beats per minute); after receiving the antidote the victim stabilized. 

In another case, a 16-year-old boy was bitten on his left hand. The victim had severe general pain, visual disturbance, generalized tremors, cramps, profuse sweating, and a weak, irregular to rapid pulse.

A 23-year-old market worker moving a bunch of bananas was bitten on his hand by &quot;P. nigriventer&quot; in São Paulo, Brazil. The specimen measured 3.5 cm long and 6 cm with its legs. It was reported that the wound was extremely painful, with the victim noticing that the bite area was sweating and the hair on his skin stood on end. He also reported that the pain radiated to his chest, and that his heart began to race. The victim was dizzy and nauseated, felt cold, began to drool and vomit, and exhibited priapism. He was later treated with anesthetics, tetanus prophylaxis and anti-venom, and recovered 36 hours after the bite.

Another case occurred with a 52-year-old man, bitten by an adult female &quot;P. nigriventer&quot;. Immediately after the bite he experienced severe local pain, blurred vision, profuse sweating and vomiting. From one to two hours after the bite he presented agitation and high blood pressure; at four hours after the heart rate was high at 150 beats per minute, mild tachypnea, cold extremities, profuse sweating, generalized tremors and priapism. He was treated with anesthetics, anti-venom and fluid replacement.

In 2005, an English man was bitten twice by a spider identified as a &quot;Phoneutria&quot;, which was hidden in a box of bananas. It was reported that his hand became swollen, he felt dizzy, and that when he got home he collapsed. He was taken to the hospital and received treatment, but his condition continued to deteriorate. He reported chest tightness, difficulty breathing, and both his blood pressure and heart rate were high. He was treated with increased saline to release toxins from the body, and was discharged the next day. He took almost a week to recover.

A 70-year-old man was bitten by a spider with a legspan of 5 to 6 cm. He was cutting sugarcane at the residence of São Pedro de Alcantara, in the countryside, when a spider jumped on his shoulder and came &quot;walking&quot; by the right arm to the back where it bit his hand (bled at the time); he felt intense pain at the time. The spider had several young in the abdomen. The patient evolved with agitation, anxiety, blood pressure 200x110 mmHg, heart rate with 62 beats per minute, respiratory rate 36 breathing movements per minute, respiratory distress, hyperemia, edema and radiating pain. After 50 minutes, the patient was admitted to the emergency department of the HU with blood pressure 150x90 (after captopril), mild dyspnea (patient pneumectomized by TU), with paresthesias and local condition as previously reported. He received anesthetic infiltration, dipyrone and two vials of serum, the right hand remained red and swollen, with improvement in anxiety symptoms and controlled blood pressure.

Another case occurred in Minas Gerais, Brazil, where a man bitten by a &quot;Phoneutria&quot; developed numbness in his legs, redness, headache and loss of sense of time and space.

===Reports of deaths===
In a case that occurred in Itanhaém, São Paulo, a 40-year-old man bitten in the foot, presented significant pain and generalized contractures, dying six hours after the accident.

A 7-year-old child, bitten in the ear, presented convulsions, opisthotonos and progressive paralysis, dying 17 hours after the accident.

In a case that occurred in Franca, a 10-year-old child bitten on the middle finger of the right hand, presented severe pain, trismus, tremors in the right arm and face, evolving to permanent contracture, respiratory paralysis, cyanosis and convulsions, dying in 30–40 minutes after the accident.

In São Sebastião, São Paulo, two brothers, 6 months and 18 months old, the children woke up during the night crying and screaming, dying soon after (time of death is not described). The father removed the sheets and found the spider, which was referred to the Butantan Institute, identified as a large female &quot;Phoneutria nigriventer&quot;.

A 3-year-old girl, bitten on the third finger of her right hand, presented immediate local pain, periods of alternating prostration, cold sweating, chest and abdomen pains and 3 episodes of vomiting, was admitted to UNICAMP 3 hours after the accident, with the same symptoms. 5 vials of AV (Antivenom) and local anesthetic infiltration were administered, and there was improvement in symptoms, with decrease in sweating, but still agitated, 2–3 hours after AV, there was a picture of significant diarrhea (semi-liquid stools) evolving to 2nd degree dehydration. Parenteral hydration was started, 3h30 min post AV, her heart rate was 160 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 72 at 4 hours post AV. Between 4h15min and 4h30min after AV, she had peripheral cyanosis, a heart rate of 150 beats per minute and dyspnea, and loss of peripheral venous access. Afterwards, there was disseminated pulmonary stertoration, and worsening of agitation, dyspnea and bradycardia, while being performed orotracheal intubation, manual ventilation, adrenaline and external cardiac massage, she later died.

<text>Pierino Ronald &quot;Perry&quot; Como (; May 18, 1912 – May 12, 2001) was an American singer, actor, and television personality. During a career spanning more than half a century, he recorded exclusively for RCA Victor for 44 years, from 1943 until 1987.
&quot;Mr. C.&quot;, as he was nicknamed, reportedly sold over 100 million records worldwide and pioneered a weekly musical variety television show. His weekly television shows and seasonal specials were broadcast throughout the world. He recorded primarily vocal pop and was renowned for recordings in the intimate, easy-listening genre pioneered by multimedia star Bing Crosby. In the official RCA Records &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine memorial, his life was summed up in these few words: &quot;50 years of music and a life well lived. An example to all.&quot;

Como received five Emmys from 1955 to 1959, and a Christopher Award in 1956. He also shared a Peabody Award with good friend Jackie Gleason in 1956. He received a Kennedy Center Honor in 1987 and was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame in 1990. Posthumously, Como received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002 and was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006. He has the distinction of having three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio, television, and music.

==Early years==
Como was born in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, about southwest of Pittsburgh. He was the seventh of 13 children and the first American-born child of Pietro Como (1877–1945) and Lucia Travaglini (1883–1961), who both emigrated to the US in 1910 from the Abruzzese town of Palena, Italy. He did not begin speaking English until he entered school, since the Comos spoke Italian at home. The family had a second-hand organ his father had bought for $3; as soon as Como was able to toddle, he would head to the instrument, pump the bellows, and play music he had heard.

Pietro, a mill hand and an amateur baritone, had all his children take music lessons even if he could barely afford them. In a rare 1957 interview, Como&#x27;s mother, Lucia, described how her young son also took on other jobs to pay for more music lessons; Como learned to play many different instruments, but never had a voice lesson. He showed more musical talent in his teenaged years as a trombone player in the town&#x27;s brass band, playing guitar, singing at weddings, and as an organist at church. Como was a member of the Canonsburg Italian Band along with bandleader Stan Vinton, father of singer Bobby Vinton and often a customer at Como&#x27;s barber shop.

Como started helping his family at age 10, working before and after school in Steve Fragapane&#x27;s barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had graduated to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. Also around this time, Como lost his week&#x27;s wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger got the better of him. He managed to tell his father what had happened to the money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this.

When Como was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.

Despite his musical ability, Como&#x27;s primary ambition was to become the best barber in Canonsburg. Practicing on his father, he mastered the skills well enough to have his own shop at age 14. One of Como&#x27;s regular customers at the barber shop owned a Greek coffeehouse that included a barber shop area, and asked Como whether he would like to take over that portion of his shop. Como had so much work after moving to the coffeehouse, he had to hire two barbers to help. His customers worked mainly at the nearby steel mills. They were well-paid, did not mind spending money on themselves, and enjoyed Como&#x27;s song renditions. He did especially well when one of his customers would marry. The groom and his men would avail themselves of every treatment Como and his assistants had to offer. Como sang romantic songs while busying himself with the groom as the other two barbers worked with the rest of the groom&#x27;s party. During the wedding preparation, the groom&#x27;s friends and relatives would come into the shop with gifts of money for Como. He became so popular as a &quot;wedding barber&quot; in the Greek community that he was asked to provide his services in Pittsburgh and throughout Ohio.

==Singing career==

===Freddy Carlone and Ted Weems===
In 1932, Como left Canonsburg, moving about 100 miles away to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where his uncle had a barber shop in the Hotel Conneaut. About 80 miles from Cleveland, it was a popular stop on the itinerary for dance bands who worked up and down the Ohio Valley. Como, his girlfriend Roselle, and their friends had gone to nearby Cleveland; their good times took them to the Silver Slipper Ballroom, where Freddy Carlone and his orchestra were playing. Carlone invited anyone who thought he might have talent to come up and sing with his band. Como was terrified, but his friends urged him and pushed him onto the stage. Carlone was so impressed with Como&#x27;s performance that he immediately offered him a job.

Como was not certain if he should accept Carlone&#x27;s offer, so he returned to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Como expected his father would tell him to stay in the barber business, but to his surprise, his father said if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; at this time, Como was earning around $125 per week from his barber shop, while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her fiancé and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Carlone&#x27;s band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; Como would be on the road for the next 18 months.

Three years after joining Carlone, Como moved to Ted Weems&#x27;s Orchestra and his first recording dates. Como and Weems met in 1936 while the Carlone orchestra was playing in Warren, Ohio. Como initially did not take the offer to join Weems&#x27;s orchestra. Apparently realizing it was the best move for Como, Carlone selflessly urged him to sign with Weems. Art Jarrett had just left the Weems organization to start his own band. Weems was in need of a vocalist; Como got a raise. Weems paid him $50 per week, his first chance for nationwide exposure. Weems and his orchestra were based in Chicago and were regulars on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; and &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;. The Weems band also had its own weekly radio program on the Mutual Broadcasting System during 1936–1937.

From the show, Como acquired polish and his own style with Weems&#x27;s help. Mutual&#x27;s Chicago affiliate, WGN radio, threatened to stop carrying the Weems broadcasts from Chicago&#x27;s Palmer House if his new singer did not improve. Weems had recordings of some of his previous radio programs; one evening he and Como listened to them, and Como was shocked to realize no one could understand the lyrics when he sang. Weems told Como there was no need for him to resort to vocal tricks; what was necessary was to sing from the heart.

Como&#x27;s first recording with the Weems band was a novelty tune called &quot;You Can&#x27;t Pull the Wool Over My Eyes&quot;, recorded for the Decca Records label in May 1936. During one of Como&#x27;s early Decca recording sessions with the Weems orchestra, Weems was told to get rid of &quot;that kid&quot; (Como) because he sounded too much like Bing Crosby, who also recorded for Decca. Before Como could reply, Weems spoke up, saying Como was part of the session or it was over. By the time Como had been with Weems about a year, he was mentioned in a 1937 &quot;Life&quot; magazine NBC Radio ad for &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; as &quot;causing cardiac flutters with his crooning&quot;. The weekly radio show, &quot;Beat the Band&quot;, which ran on NBC from 1940 to 1944, was a &quot;stump the band&quot;-type musical quiz show on which Weems and his orchestra were featured from 1940 to 1941.

===RCA Victor and radio===
The Comos’ first child, Ronnie, was born in 1940, while the Weems band was working in Chicago. Como left to be at his wife&#x27;s side, though he was threatened with dismissal if he did so. Though Como was now making $250 a week and travel expenses for the family were no problem, Ronnie could not become used to a normal routine when they were unable to stay in one place for a period of time. The radio program &quot;Beat the Band&quot; did not always originate from Chicago, but was often broadcast from other cities such as Milwaukee, Denver, and St. Louis. The band continued to play road engagements while part of the program was broadcast. Como decided life on the road was no place to raise a child, and Roselle and the baby went back to Canonsburg.

In late 1942, Como decided to quit the Weems band, even if it meant giving up singing. Weary of life on the road and missing his wife and son, he returned to Canonsburg, his family, and his trade. Como received an offer to become a Frank Sinatra imitator, but chose to keep his own style. While Como was negotiating for a store lease to reopen a barber shop, he received a call from Tommy Rockwell at General Artists Corporation, who also represented Weems. Como fielded many other calls that also brought offers, but he liked and trusted Rockwell, who was offering him his own sustaining (unsponsored) Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio show and promising to get him a recording contract. The offers were also appealing because it meant staying put in New York with no more road tours. As Como pondered the job offer, Roselle told him, &quot;You can always get another barber shop if it doesn&#x27;t work out!&quot; Until the radio show and recording contract offers, he did not view singing as his true career, believing the years with Carlone and Weems had been enjoyable but now it was time to get back to work. Como said in a 1983 interview, &quot;I thought I&#x27;d have my fun and I&#x27;d go home to work.&quot;

Perry made his debut radio broadcast for CBS on March 12, 1943. Rockwell&#x27;s next move was to book Como into the Copacabana nightclub for two weeks beginning on June 10, 1943. At this same time, RCA Victor was looking for a crooner to compete with Sinatra and Crosby; Como signed his first recording contract with RCA Victor and three days after that, cut his first record for the company, &quot;Goodbye, Sue&quot;. It was the beginning of a professional relationship that lasted for 44 years. He became a very successful performer in theater and nightclub engagements; Como&#x27;s initial two weeks at the Copacabana in June stretched into August. Sinatra would sometimes call Como and ask him to fill in for him at his Paramount Theater performances.

The crooning craze was at its height during this time, and the &quot;bobby soxer&quot; and &quot;swooner&quot; teenaged girls who were wild about Sinatra added Como to their list. A &quot;swooners&quot; club voted Perry &quot;Crooner of the Year&quot; in 1943. The line for a Perry Como Paramount performance was three deep and wound around the city block. Como&#x27;s popularity also extended to a more mature audience when he played the Versailles and returned to the Copacabana, where the management placed &quot;SRO-Swooning Ruled Out&quot; cards on their tables.

Doug Storer, who was an advertising manager with the Blackman Company at the time, became convinced of Como&#x27;s abilities after hearing him on his unsponsored CBS Radio show. Storer produced a demonstration radio program recording with Como and the Mitchell Ayres Orchestra, which he brought to the advertising agency that handled the Chesterfield Cigarettes account. Initially, the agency liked the format of the show, but wanted someone else as the star, asking Storer to obtain the release of the singer they preferred, so he would be free for their new program. Storer decided to do nothing about getting the singer released from his contract. When he was contacted by the agency some weeks later, saying they were ready to put the program on the air on NBC, Storer bluntly told them the man for their show was the man they had heard on the demo recording. The program was scheduled to make its debut in a week; the only option was to hire Como for the show. Storer then arranged for Como&#x27;s release from his CBS contract. On December 11, 1944, he moved from CBS to NBC for a new radio program, &quot;Chesterfield Supper Club&quot;.

The April 5, 1946, broadcasts of the &quot;Chesterfield Supper Club&quot; took place 20,000 feet in the air; these were the first known instances of a complete radio show being presented from an airplane. Como, Jo Stafford, the Lloyd Shaffer Orchestra, and the entire &quot;Supper Club&quot; crew made the flights for the shows. Two &quot;Supper Club&quot; broadcast flights were made that evening: at 6 pm and again at 10 pm for the West Coast broadcast of the show. Three flights were made; an earlier rehearsal flight was made for reception purposes. In addition to the band instruments, the plane also carried a small piano. Because the stand-held microphones were not very useful on the plane, hand-held mikes were used, but they became extremely heavy to hold after a few minutes. This mid-air performance caused the American Federation of Musicians to consider this a new type of engagement and issue a special set of rates for it.

From 1989 until his death in 2001, Como co-hosted a weekly syndicated radio show with John Knox called &quot;Weekend With Perry&quot;.

===Como in concert===
Como had not made a nightclub appearance in 26 years when he accepted an engagement at the International Hotel in Las Vegas in June 1970, which also resulted in his first &quot;live&quot; album, &quot;Perry Como in Person at the International Hotel, Las Vegas&quot;. Ray Charles, whose Ray Charles Singers were heard with Como for over 35 years, formed a special edition of the vocal group for Como&#x27;s Vegas opening. Como had last appeared at New York&#x27;s Copacabana in 1944. Como continued to do periodic engagements in Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe, limiting his nightclub appearances to Nevada.

Performing live again brought Como a new sense of enjoyment. In May 1974, he embarked on his first concert appearance outside the U.S., a show at the London Palladium for the Variety Club of Great Britain to aid children&#x27;s charities. It was here where he discovered what he had been missing when the audience cheered for ten minutes after he walked onstage. At the show&#x27;s end, Como sat in a chair, delightedly chatting back and forth with his equally delighted fans. Perry returned to the United Kingdom in November for a &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; to benefit the Entertainment Artistes&#x27; Benevolent Fund with Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in attendance. Como was invited to visit Buckingham Palace the day after the show. At first, the invitation did not extend to his associates traveling and working with him, and Como politely declined. When word reached the Palace regarding the reason for Perry&#x27;s turning down the invitation, it was then extended to include the entire Como party and Como accepted. Soon after, he announced his first concert tour that began in the UK in the spring of 1975.

In 1982, Como and Frank Sinatra were invited to entertain Italian President Sandro Pertini at a White House state dinner when he made an official visit. President Pertini enjoyed their performance enough to join them in singing &quot;Santa Lucia&quot;. The pair reprised this routine the next year in California as part of the entertainment for Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Royal visit. Perry was on the program by special request of the Queen.

In 1984, Como traveled the US with his 50th Anniversary tour. Having spent most of his professional life in radio or recording studios and on television soundstages, he was enjoying doing live performances. Even after his 80th birthday, Como continued the concert tours. Gone, however, were the cardigan sweaters which had been a staple of his weekly television shows, and which he had actually hated wearing. Como now performed in a tuxedo, saying, &quot;It shows respect for the audience.&quot;
The return to live appearances also provided Como with an opportunity to have a little fun with his &quot;Mister Nice Guy&quot; image in a song Ray Charles and Nick Perito, his closest collaborator since 1963, wrote and composed for him:&lt;br&gt;
===Vocal characteristics===
Como credited Bing Crosby for influencing his voice and style. Como&#x27;s voice is known for its good-natured vocal acrobatics as portrayed in his novelty songs such as &quot;Hot Diggity (Dog Ziggity Boom)&quot;, but there was another side to Como. Music critic Gene Lees describes it in his sleeve note to Como&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;Look To Your Heart&quot;:

Despite his immense popularity, Como is rarely given credit for what, once you stop and think of it, he so clearly is: one of the great singers and one of the great artists of our time.

Perhaps the reason people rarely talk about his formidable attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art is the result of mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together to the point where you can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don&#x27;t even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it—but happily so.

—Gene Lees, sleeve note, &quot;Look To Your Heart&quot;
==Film career==

Como&#x27;s Hollywood-type good looks earned him a seven-year contract with 20th Century-Fox in 1943. He made four films for Fox, &quot;Something for the Boys&quot; (1944), &quot;March of Time&quot; (1945), &quot;Doll Face&quot; (1945), and &quot;If I&#x27;m Lucky&quot; (1946). He also appeared in a single film for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, &quot;Words and Music&quot; (1948). Como never appeared to be truly comfortable in films, feeling the roles assigned him did not match his personality.

A Hollywood press agent sought to alter Como&#x27;s life story by changing his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming it would make for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick. Como gave him a shave and haircut at the Fox Studios barber shop to prove him wrong. In 1985, Como related the story of his first film role experience in &quot;Something for the Boys&quot;. He sat ready to work in his dressing room for two weeks without being called. Como spent the next two weeks playing golf, still not missed by the studio. It was five weeks before he was actually called to the set, despite the studio&#x27;s initial urgent report for work notice. When Como finally appeared, the director had no idea who he was.

At the time Como was signed, musical films were on the wane and he became a studio contract player, where the actors or actresses worked only when the studio needed to fill out a schedule. Though his last film, &quot;Words and Music&quot;, was made for prestigious Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Como fared no better. Less than two weeks before the film&#x27;s release, Walter Winchell wrote in his syndicated column, &quot;Someone at MGM must have been dozing when they wrote the script for &quot;Words and Music&quot;. In most of the film Perry Como is called Eddie Anders and toward the end (for no reason) they start calling him Perry Como.&quot; Como asked for and received a release from the remainder of his MGM contract later the same year. Quoting Como, &quot;I was wasting their time and they were wasting mine.&quot;

Como&#x27;s comments during a 1949 interview were prophetic, as far as his success was concerned. At the time he was doing the &quot;Chesterfield Supper Club&quot; on radio and TV, &quot;Television is going to do me a lot more personal good than the movies ever have ... The reason should be obvious. On television, I&#x27;m allowed to be myself; in pictures, I was always some other guy. I come over like just another bum in a tuxedo.&quot; After he began appearing regularly on television, Como was offered some film roles that interested him, but there was never enough time to pursue any film work.

==Television career==

===Early years: 1948–1955===

Como made the move to television when NBC initially televised the &quot;Chesterfield Supper Club&quot; radio program on December 24, 1948. A guest on that first show was Como&#x27;s eight-year-old son, Ronnie, as part of a boys&#x27; choir singing &quot;Silent Night&quot; with his father. The show was the usual Friday night &quot;Chesterfield Supper Club&quot; with an important exception—it was also being broadcast on television. The experimental simulcast was to continue for three Friday &quot;Supper Club&quot; shows, but had gone so well, NBC decided to extend the televised version through August 1949. Years later, Como admitted to being scared and feeling awkward initially but somehow managed to just be himself. Said Como, &quot;You can&#x27;t act on TV. With me, what you see is what you get.&quot; While still in its experimental phase, Como and the television show survived an on location broadcast in Durham, North Carolina, on April 15, 1949.

On September 8, 1949, it became a weekly half-hour offering on Sunday nights, directly opposite Ed Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;. In 1950, Como moved to CBS and the show&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;The Perry Como Chesterfield Show&quot;, again sponsored by Liggett &amp; Myers&#x27; Chesterfield cigarettes. Como hosted this informal 15-minute musical variety series on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, following the &quot;CBS Television News&quot;. &quot;The Faye Emerson Show&quot; was initially broadcast in the same time slot on Tuesday and Thursday. By 1952, it was evident that television would replace radio as the major entertainment medium. Gary Giddins, the biographer of Bing Crosby, said in 2001, &quot;He (Como) came from this whole generation of crooners—Crosby and Sinatra, but he was the only one of them who figured out TV.&quot; Como&#x27;s 15-minute TV show was simulcast on radio via the Mutual Broadcasting System beginning August 24, 1953; while the &quot;Chesterfield Supper Club&quot; broadcasts were simulcast on radio and television, this was the first instance of a simulcast between two networks.

Como&#x27;s CBS contract was to expire on July 1, 1955. The year before, he had been asked to be the master of ceremonies and narrator of the NBC Radio 35th anniversary special. That April, Perry Como signed a 12-year &quot;unbreakable&quot; contract with NBC. On his last CBS show, June 24, 1955, Como was in high spirits, bringing all those who worked off camera on the air for introductions. Como tried his hand at camera work, getting a picture on the air but one that was upside-down. In appreciation for the 11-year association, his sponsor, Chesterfield, presented him with all the musical arrangements used during this time as a parting gift.
===Sing to me, Mr. C.: 1955–1959===
 He moved back to NBC with &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot;, a weekly hour-long variety show featuring additional musical and production numbers, comedy sketches and guest stars premiering September 17, 1955. This version of his show was also so popular that, in the 1956–1957 television season, it reached ninth in the Nielsen ratings: the only show on NBC that season to land in the top ten.

Como&#x27;s &quot;Dream Along With Me&quot; became the show&#x27;s opening theme song, &quot;Mr. C.&quot; received the first of many &quot;stacks and stacks of letters&quot; requesting him to sing a specific song. It was also here where he began wearing his trademark cardigan sweaters. The &quot;Sing to me, Mr. C.&quot; segment with Como seated on a stool singing viewer requested songs had its roots in the first television broadcasts of &quot;Chesterfield Supper Club&quot;. When cameras entered the &quot;Supper Club&quot; radio studio, they found Como and his guests sitting on stools behind music stands. The show&#x27;s closing theme was, &quot;You Are Never Far Away From Me&quot;.

Perry&#x27;s announcer on the broadcasts, Frank Gallop, became a foil for Como&#x27;s jokes. When the television show began, there was not enough room for Gallop to appear on stage; he was an invisible &quot;voice from the clouds&quot; until the show&#x27;s 1958–1959 season. There was as much fun at rehearsals as on the show itself. Como&#x27;s relaxed and fun-loving manner at rehearsals put many nervous guests at ease. It was common for Como to leave the Saturday-afternoon rehearsal for about a half-hour to go to confession. He managed to save some time by asking his music publisher, Mickey Glass, to wait in line for him at the confessional. Glass, who was Jewish, was most agreeable to this but wondered what to do if his turn came before Como arrived.

Como thoroughly enjoyed his years working in television, saying in a 1989 interview, &quot;I got a kick out of live television. The spontaneity was the fun of it.&quot; Spontaneity and the ability to be himself came in handy for swimmer/actress Esther Williams&#x27;s guest appearance of March 16, 1957. A wardrobe malfunction meant that viewers were seeing more of Esther than 1950s television considered to be in good taste; more live show mishaps followed. At the show&#x27;s end, Williams was swimming in a pool specially constructed on the set for her appearance. Como simply said, &quot;Goodnight, folks,&quot; and leaped, fully clothed, into the swimming pool.

On December 17, 1955, viewers were able to see first-hand what Como did for a living before he was a professional singer. Actor Kirk Douglas was one of Como&#x27;s television guests; Douglas had grown a beard for his Vincent van Gogh role in &quot;&quot;, which finished filming that week. Como shaved Douglas&#x27;s beard live on national television. On September 15, 1956, the season premiere of &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; was broadcast from NBC&#x27;s new color television studio at the New York Ziegfeld Theatre, making it one of the first weekly color TV shows. In addition to this season premiere as a color television show, there was also a royal visit from Prince Rainier of Monaco and his bride of six months, Grace Kelly. Como competed with Jackie Gleason in what was billed as the &quot;Battle of the Giants&quot; and won. This is rarely mentioned, in part because Como commonly downplayed his achievements and because the two men were friends. The weekly ratings winner would phone the loser for some mock gloating. At the height of this television competition, Como asked Gleason a favor: to visit his home when his mother-in-law, a big Gleason fan, was there. Though Mrs. Belline spoke no English and Gleason no Italian, Roselle&#x27;s mother was thrilled. Como&#x27;s words to Gleason after the visit, &quot;Anything you want, you got it. In fact, I&#x27;ll even do one of your shows so the ratings will be better.&quot; Como was among those who filled in for Gleason on &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; in 1954 when the entertainer suffered a broken ankle and leg in an on-air fall.

An example of Como&#x27;s popularity came in 1956, when &quot;Life&quot; conducted a poll of young women, asking them which man in public life most fit the concept of their ideal husband: it was Perry Como. A 1958 nationwide poll of U.S. teenagers found Como to be the most popular male singer, beating Elvis Presley, who was the winner of the previous year&#x27;s poll. At one point, his television show was broadcast in at least 12 other countries.

Another way to judge the value of the Como show to the network can be found in the following: during sound checks at rehearsals, it was often difficult to hear Como&#x27;s soft voice without having a large microphone ruin a camera shot. NBC had RCA design a microphone for the show—the RCA Type BK-10A—which was known as the &quot;Como mic&quot;; it was able to pick up Como&#x27;s voice properly and was small enough not to interfere with camera shots.

===&quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot;: 1959–1967===
In 1959, Como signed a $25 million deal with Kraft Foods and moved to Wednesday nights, hosting &quot;Perry Como&#x27;s Kraft Music Hall&quot; weekly for the next four years. Over the next four seasons, from 1963 to 1967, the series was presented as monthly specials alternating with &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;, and finally &quot;The Road West&quot;. Como became the highest-paid performer in the history of television to that date, earning mention in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. Como himself took part in none of this; his production company, Roncom, named for son Ronald Como, handled the transaction along with all other Como business matters. Como also had control of the show which would replace his during the summer television hiatus. While &quot;Mr. C.&quot; was having a holiday, viewers would see &quot;Perry Presents&quot;, beginning in 1959.

In late 1962, after the Cuban Missile Crisis had settled well enough to permit the evacuated servicemen&#x27;s families to return to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was eager to do more for morale there. He asked Como to bring his television show to the Naval base. Como and his cast and crew were at Guantanamo when the families of the armed forces began their return. The first entertainers to visit the base since the crisis, the Como show filmed there for eight days. Some highlights of the program, which was seen in the US on December 12, 1962, included Como&#x27;s shaving a serviceman with a Castro-like beard and the enthusiastic participation when Perry asked for volunteers to come on stage to do the Twist with the lovely ladies who were part of the visiting dance troupe.

Filming for the &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot; Christmas show that was aired on December 17, 1964, began at the Vatican November 7. By special permission of Pope Paul VI, Como and his crew were able to shoot segments in the Vatican gardens and other areas where cameras had never been permitted previously. The show featured the first television appearance of the Sistine Chapel Choir, and also the first time a non-choir member (Como) sang with them. The choir performed a Christmas hymn in Latin written by their director, Domenico Bartolucci, called &quot;Christ Is Born&quot;, as part of their presentation. Como asked his associate, Ray Charles, to write English lyrics for the song, using it many times on both television shows and his Christmas albums. The Carpenters also recorded the song on their first Christmas album, &quot;Christmas Portrait&quot;.

===Specials===
Beginning in 1967, Como began reducing his TV appearances, gradually becoming limited to seasonal and holiday specials with the emphasis being on Christmas. A large part of Como&#x27;s public persona was the idea that he personally knew Santa Claus. Como had numerous Christmas television specials, beginning on Christmas Eve 1948, and continuing to 1994, when his final Christmas special was recorded in Ireland. They were recorded in many countries, including Israel, Mexico, and Canada, as well as many locations throughout the United States, including a Colonial America Christmas in Williamsburg, Virginia. The 1987 Christmas special was cancelled at the behest of an angry Como; the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) was willing to offer him only a Saturday 10 PM time slot for it three weeks before the holiday. Como filled the yearly gap for his fans with live Christmas concerts in various locations.

Como&#x27;s final Christmas special was filmed in January 1994 in Dublin&#x27;s Point Theatre before an audience of 4,500, including Irish President Mary Robinson and Como&#x27;s friend, the actress Maureen O&#x27;Hara. &quot;Perry Como&#x27;s Irish Christmas&quot; was a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) production, made by an Irish independent production company in association with RTÉ. Como, appearing aged and unwell, had the flu during the show, which took four hours to record. At the show&#x27;s conclusion, Como apologized to his Dublin audience for a performance he felt was not up to his usual standards. During his visit to Dublin, Como visited a barber shop called &quot;The Como&quot; on Thomas Street. The owners, lifelong fans who named their business in his honor, had sent photographs of the shop and letters to Como inviting him to visit. Photos of Como with the barbers were framed in the shop. &quot;The Como&quot; closed in 2002, but it remains a household name in The Liberties.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and family===
In 1929, the 17-year-old Como met Roselle Belline at a picnic on Chartiers Creek that attracted many young people from the Canonsburg area. Como, who attended the cookout with another girl, did not spot Roselle until everyone was around the campfire singing and the gathering was coming to a close. When it came Como&#x27;s turn to sing, he chose &quot;More Than You Know&quot;, with his eyes on Roselle for the entire song. They were married July 31, 1933. They raised three children, Ronnie, David, and Terri. Because Como believed his professional life and his personal life should be kept separate, he declined repeated interview requests from Edward R. Murrow&#x27;s &quot;Person to Person&quot;.

In 1946, Como moved to Flower Hill, New York.

In 1958, the Comos celebrated their silver wedding anniversary with a family trip to Italy. On the itinerary was an audience with Pope Pius XII. Como, who sat in a side wing of the Long Island church where he attended Sunday Mass in an effort to avoid attracting attention, was both puzzled and upset on returning home that photos from the visit made the newspapers throughout the world. A thorough check of the Como and NBC publicity offices found neither was responsible; the photos had been released by the Vatican&#x27;s press department. When Perry and Roselle became Knight Commander and Lady Commander of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre in 1952, it was a news item only after Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, who had been honored at the same ceremony, mentioned it some time later.
In 1971 while taping &quot;Perry Como&#x27;s Winter Show&quot; in Hollywood, Como suffered a debilitating fall from a stage platform. X-rays showed no serious injury to his knee, but by the next morning it was swollen to twice its normal size. Como chartered a jet to his home and doctors in Florida, where a second exam showed the knee was seriously broken. His knee was re-set and placed in a cast; recuperation took eight months. In 1993, he was successfully treated for bladder cancer.

 After 65 years of marriage, Roselle died August 12, 1998, at age 84. Como was devastated by her death.

===Public persona===
One of the many factors in his success was Como&#x27;s insistence on his principles of good taste; if he considered something to be in bad or questionable taste, it was not in the show or broadcast. When a line written for Julius La Rosa about television personality Arthur Godfrey on &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; was misconstrued, Como offered an on-air apology at the beginning of his next show, against the advice of his staff. While his performance of &quot;Ave Maria&quot; was a tradition of his holiday television programs, Como refused to sing it at live performances, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not the time or place to do it&quot;, even though it was the number-one request of his audiences.

Another factor was his naturalness; the man on TV every week was the same person who could be encountered behind a supermarket shopping cart, at a bowling alley, or in a kitchen making breakfast. From his first &quot;Chesterfield Supper Club&quot; TV show, if scripts were written at all, they were based on Como&#x27;s everyday manner of speaking. Though Como was widely known for his amiability, laid-back and easygoing style, he was not devoid of a temper, and it could be seen at times as a result of the frustrations of daily life. Mitchell Ayres, his musical director from 1948 - 1963, said, &quot;Perry has a temper like everyone else. And he loses his temper at the normal things everyone else does. When we&#x27;re driving, for instance, and somebody cuts him off, he really lets the offender have it.&quot;

Bing Crosby once described Como as &quot;the man who invented casual&quot;. His preference for casual clothing did not keep him from being named one of the Best Dressed Men beginning in 1946, and continuing long after Como stopped appearing on weekly television. Como also had his own line of sports/casual men&#x27;s clothing made by Bucknell c. early 1950s.

===Hobbies===
Perry was an avid and accomplished golfer; there was always time to try getting in a golf game. &quot;Perry Como Putters&quot; were sold by MacGregor, each stamped with a Como facsimile autograph. His colleagues held an annual Perry Como Golf Tournament to honor him and his love for the game. Como&#x27;s guests on the October 3, 1962, broadcast were Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, and Gary Player. The four golfers played 18 holes for the cameras at Sands Point, New York, where the Comos made their home in the television years. Como also enjoyed fishing and he could be found out on his boat almost daily after the family moved to Florida. Perry&#x27;s catches would usually turn out to be the Como family&#x27;s dinners. Como also used his boat as a rehearsal hall with pre-recorded instrumental tapes sent to him by RCA Victor. Como would work on material while he was waiting for the fish to bite. Having enjoyed golfing and fishing in the North Carolina mountains for several years, Como built a vacation home in Saluda, North Carolina, in 1980. He discouraged photos of his home, as it was his private place to get away from celebrity life.

==Death==
Como died in his sleep on May 12, 2001, at his home in Jupiter Inlet Colony, Florida, six days before his 89th birthday. He was reported to have suffered from symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Como&#x27;s older son, Ronnie, and his daughter, Terri, could not agree on their interpretations of Como&#x27;s 1999 living will and it became a matter for the courts in the year before his death. His funeral Mass took place at St. Edward&#x27;s Catholic Church in Palm Beach, Florida. Como and his wife, Roselle, are buried at Riverside Memorial Park, Tequesta, Palm Beach County, Florida.

==Honors and tributes==
===Awards===
Como received the 1959 Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance, Male; five Emmys from 1955 to 1959; a Christopher Award (1956) and shared a Peabody Award with good friend Jackie Gleason in 1956. He was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame in 1990 and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 1987. Posthumously, Como received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002; he was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Como has the distinction of having three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio, television, and music.

===Tributes===
In the official RCA Records &quot;Billboard&quot; memorial, his life was summed up in these words: &quot;50 years of music and a life well lived. An example to all.&quot; Composer Ervin Drake said of him, &quot;... [o]ccasionally someone like Perry comes along and won&#x27;t &#x27;go with the flow&#x27; and still prevails in spite of all the bankrupt others who surround him and importune him to yield to their values. Only occasionally.&quot;

===Hometown honors===
Canonsburg has always been very proud to be the birthplace of Perry Como; the local newspaper of the time, &quot;Canonsburg Daily Notes&quot;, seems to have been the first to write an article about him. Their edition of July 19, 1934, featured a photo and the following: &quot;A young Canonsburg boy threatens to snatch the crown from Bing Crosby&#x27;s head. Perry Como, son of Mr. and Mrs. Pietro Como of 530 Franklin Ave. is said to have one of the grandest baritone voices in the country.&quot; The borough honored him three times over the course of his life. The first of these events took place September 14, 1946, when Third Street, where Perry worked in the barber shop of Steve Fragapane, was renamed &quot;Perry Como Avenue&quot;. Perry, Roselle, and Como&#x27;s mother, Lucy, attended the ceremonies and banquet held at the State Armory.

A second ceremony marking Perry Como Day took place August 24, 1977, but the most ambitious project began in 1997 – a statue of the singer. The planned statue had the blessing of Como&#x27;s wife, Roselle, who died the year before it was unveiled on May 15, 1999. As part of the festivities, Como&#x27;s stool and music stand from &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; and the equipment he used at Steve Fragapane&#x27;s barber shop were donated to the borough. Como was not present at the unveiling because of poor health. The inscription on the base, &quot;To This Place God Has Brought Me&quot;, was a favorite saying of Como&#x27;s; the musical feature was added in 2002.

The Como celebration crossed the Atlantic in August 2002. Palena, Italy, the birthplace of Como&#x27;s parents, had a long-standing week-long festival in honor of the singer. A smaller version of the statue was taken to Palena by the mayor of Canonsburg, Anthony Colaizzo. Perry&#x27;s son, David, and his wife were also in attendance when the town of Palena renamed a street for Como. Dating from these ceremonies, there is a marble plaque on a Palena town wall stating that Pietro and Lucia Como, parents of Perry Como, emigrated from this village to the United States.

Perry Como never forgot Canonsburg. One of the things he did to give a helping hand to his home town was to convince RCA to open a record-pressing plant there. Those who needed to raise funds for local projects like Boys&#x27; and Girls&#x27; Clubs found him always ready to do whatever was needed.
In 2007, the local McDonald&#x27;s was rebuilt. The building includes memorabilia of Como and another Canonsburg native, Bobby Vinton. A children&#x27;s playground in Canonsburg on Giffin Avenue is also named for Como. In downtown Canonsburg, all of the tree grates are marked with information about the records that sold a million copies and the town clock hourly plays one of the hits of Como (141), Vinton (44), or the Four Coins (7), also from Canonsburg.

<text>The Mygalomorphae, or mygalomorphs, are an infraorder of spiders, and comprise one of three major groups of living spiders with over 3,000 species, found on all continents except Antarctica. Many members are known as trapdoor spiders due to their creation of trapdoors over their burrows. Other prominent groups include Australian funnel web spiders and tarantulas, with the latter accounting for around one third of all mygalomorphs.

==Description==
This group of spiders comprises mostly heavy-bodied, stout-legged spiders including tarantulas, Australian funnel-web spiders, mouse spiders, and various families of spiders commonly called trapdoor spiders.

Like the &quot;primitive&quot; suborder of spiders Mesothelae, they have two pairs of book lungs, and downward-pointing chelicerae. Because of this, the two groups were once believed to be closely related. Later it was realised that the common ancestors of all spiders had these features (a state known as symplesiomorphy). Following the branching into the suborders of Mesothelae and Opisthothelae, the mygalomorphs retained them, while their fellow Opisthothelae members, the araneomorphs, evolved new &quot;modern&quot; features, including a cribellum and cross-acting fangs. Mesotheles retain the external abdominal segmentation of ancestral arachnids and have at least vestiges of four pairs of spinnerets, whereas mygalomorphs lack abdominal segmentation (like other opistotheles) and have a reduced number of spinnerets, often only two pairs.

Like spiders in general, most species of Mygalomorphae have eight eyes, one pair of principal and three pairs of secondary eyes.

Their chelicerae and fangs are large and powerful and have ample venom glands that lie entirely within their chelicerae. These weapons, combined with their size and strength, make Mygalomorph spiders powerful predators. Many of these spiders are well adapted to killing other large arthropods and will also sometimes kill small mammals, birds, and reptiles. Despite their fearsome appearance and reputation, most mygalomorph spiders are not harmful to humans, with the exception of the Australian funnel-web spiders, especially those of the genus &quot;Atrax&quot;.

While the world&#x27;s biggest spiders are mygalomorphs – &quot;Theraphosa blondi&quot; has a body length of and a leg span of – some species are less than long. Mygalomorphs are capable of spinning at least slightly adhesive silk, and some build elaborate capture webs that approach a metre in diameter.

Unlike Araneomorphae, which die after about a year, Mygalomorphae can live for up to 25 years, and some do not reach maturity until they are about six years old. Some flies in the family Acroceridae that are endoparasites of mygalomorphs may remain dormant in their book lungs for as long as 10 years before beginning their development and consuming the spider.

One female trapdoor spider, first recorded in a survey in 1974 in Western Australia, is known to have lived for 43 years.

==Taxonomy==
The name is derived from the Greek &quot;mygalē&quot;, meaning &quot;shrew&quot;, plus &quot;morphē&quot; meaning form or shape. An older name for the group is Orthognatha, derived from the orientation of the fangs which point straight down and do not cross each other (as they do in the araneomorphs).

===Evolution===
&quot;Megarachne servinei&quot; was thought to be a giant mygalomorph from the Upper Carboniferous (about 350 million years ago), but was later found to be a eurypterid. The oldest known mygalomorph is &quot;Rosamygale grauvogeli&quot; , an avicularoid from the Triassic of northeastern France. No mygalomorphs from the Jurassic have yet been found.

The number of families and their relationships have both been undergoing substantial changes since a cladogram showing family relationships was published in 2005, with two significant studies in 2018. The division of Mygalomorphae into two superfamilies, Atypoidea and Avicularioidea, has been established in many studies. The Atypoidea retain some vestiges of abdominal segmentation in the form of dorsal tergites; the Avicularioidea lack these. Molecular phylogenetic studies undertaken between 2012 and 2017 have found somewhat different relationships within the Avicularioidea. Some families appear not to be monophyletic and further changes are possible in the future. &quot;Rosamygale&quot; belongs to Avicularioidea, based on the absence of an abdominal scutum and well-separated posterior lateral spinnerets.

Mygalomorphae tend to be highly morphologically conserved, which makes it difficult to find reliable morphological features to use for taxonomy. It has been hypothesized that because Mygalomorphae all tend to be fossorial and live in tubular webs, they are subjected to similar selective pressures, so most species should evolve in similar ways. Additionally, this may also mean that homoplasies are more likely to occur, further complicating taxonomy based on morphology.

===Phylogeny===
The relationships of taxa in the Mygalomorphae were restructured based on a comprehensive phylogenetic study by Opatova &quot;et al&quot;. (2020) The generic composition of the families Ctenizidae, Cyrtaucheniidae, Dipluridae, and Nemesiidae were relimited. Five subfamilies were raised to the rank of family: Anamidae, Euagridae, Ischnothelidae, Pycnothelidae, and Bemmeridae. Three new families were created: Entypesidae, Microhexuridae, and Stasimopidae. Lastly, a new subfamily, Australothelinae, was generated and placed in the family Euagridae.

The preferred cladogram from Optova et al. (2020) is:
===Families===

===Historical classification===
In 1802, C. A. Walckenaer separated mygalomorph spiders into a separate genus, &quot;Mygale&quot;, leaving all other spiders in &quot;Aranea&quot;

In 1985, Robert Raven published a monograph of the Mygalomorphae in which he proposed an internal classification for the Mygalomorphae, based on morphological features. Opatova &quot;et al&quot;. (2020) commented &quot;In short, much of today&#x27;s classification scheme dates back to Raven (1985)&quot;. Raven used various compound ranks, such as &quot;gigapicoorder&quot; and &quot;hyperpicoorder&quot;. Ignoring these unusual rank names, his classification can be shown diagrammatically:

Subsequent research, largely based on molecular phylogenetic studies, has not upheld some of Raven&#x27;s groupings. In particular his primary division between Tuberculotae and Fornicephalae has been replaced by a very different division between Atypoidea (expanded from Raven&#x27;s Atypoidina) and Avicularioidea, which has no counterpart in his system. As another example, the families Mecicobothriidae and Microstigmatidae, which Raven placed in Mecicobothrioidina (a &quot;gigapicoorder&quot;), are now placed very far apart in the Atypoidea and Avicularioidea respectively. Other groups, such as Crassitarsae and Domiothelina, are more recognizable, allowing for some changes in family circumscriptions.

==Distribution==

Most members of this infraorder occur in the tropics and subtropics, but their range can extend farther north, e.g. into the southern and western regions of the United States. Only a few occur in Europe: 12 species from the families Atypidae, Nemesiidae, Ctenizidae, Macrothelidae, Theraphosidae, and Cyrtaucheniidae.

Despite their limited current range, it is suggested that the Mygalomorphae were distributed worldwide before the breakup of Pangaea.

<doc id="277849" wikidata="Q843142" url="?curid=277849" title="Chelicerae">
<text>The chelicerae () are the mouthparts of the subphylum Chelicerata, an arthropod group that includes arachnids, horseshoe crabs, and sea spiders. Commonly referred to as &quot;jaws&quot;, chelicerae may be shaped as either articulated fangs, or as a type of pincers. Some chelicerae, such as those found on nearly all spiders, are hollow and contain (or are connected to) venom glands, used to inject venom into prey or a perceived threat. Both pseudoscorpions and harvestmen have additional structures on their chelicerae that are used for grooming (papillae in pseudoscorpions, cheliceral teeth in Opiliones). In &quot;Paratrechalea&quot;, males and females have shown to have a chelicerae dimorphism, because the chelicerae is used as a mating signal for females. 

==Types==
Chelicerae can be divided into three kinds: jackknife chelicerae, scissor chelicerae, and three-segmented chelicerae.

===Jackknife chelicerae===
The jackknife chelicera is subchelate (with fixed finger much reduced or absent) and is composed of two segments. This type of chelicera occurs exclusively in the Tetrapulmonata.

Jackknife chelicera are described in two different forms: orthognathous and labidognathous. Orthognathous chelicerae are articulated in a manner that enables movements of the appendages parallel to the body axis. This kind of chelicera occurs in the Liphistiomorphae and Mygalomorphae spiders and in the related orders Amblypygi, Schizomida and Uropygi. Labidognathous chelicerae move at right angles to the body axis. This kind of chelicera is rotated and occurs exclusively in the Araneomorphae spiders.

====Spider chelicerae====

The chelicerae consist of a base segment, sometimes called the &quot;paturon&quot;, that articulates with the cephalothorax (or prosoma) and a fang portion that articulates with the base segment. Almost all spiders have venom glands and can inject the venom through openings near the tips of their fangs when biting prey. The glands that produce this venom are located in the two segments of the chelicerae, and, in most spiders, extend beyond the chelicerae and into the cephalothorax. The fang, the organic functional equivalent to a hypodermic needle is what penetrates the skin, fur, or exoskeleton of the spider&#x27;s target—spider mouthparts are primarily intended for envenoming a spider&#x27;s prey in most species, typically insects and other small arthropods. The basal portion includes all or part of the spider&#x27;s venom glands, which can be squeezed to control the amount of venom forced out of the glands. Such control permits a spider to administer either a dry bite, a dose appropriate to the nature of the prey or enemy, or a maximal dose. The control is also necessary for actions such as the spitting of venomous silk by members of the family Scytodidae; they depend on that mechanism both in hunting and defence.

When a spider bites, the two parts of the chelicerae come together like a folding knife, and when making a threat display or actually preparing to bite, the spider will open the angle of the fangs with the basal portion of the &quot;chelicerae&quot; and also open the angle of the basal portion with the cephalothorax. In the tarantulas and other Mygalomorphae, the horizontal separation of the tips of the fangs does not change much, but in the other spiders the tips of the fangs move apart from each other as well as elevating. Even the tips of the fangs of the rather large spider shown above are quite sharp, and the spider&#x27;s body is well adapted to driving the fangs into flesh. Some spider bites, such as those of the Sydney funnel-web spider, are reported to have penetrated toenails and soft leather shoes.

===Uncate chelicerae===

The uncate chelicera is chelate and composed of two segments and occurs in the orders Pseudoscorpiones, Solifugae, Ricinulei, and Araneae (e.g., brown recluse, cellar spider, and crevice weaving spider).

===Three-segmented chelate chelicerae===

Having three-segmented chelate chelicerae is the primitive condition and occurs in arachnids such as the Scorpiones and the Opiliones, as well as in non-arachnid Chelicerata such as the Xiphosura and Eurypterida. The chelifores of the Pycnogonida may be homologous to chelicerae.

<text>Lanark ( ; ; ) is a town in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, located 20 kilometres to the south-east of Hamilton. The town lies on the River Clyde, at its confluence with Mouse Water. In 2016, the town had a population of 9,050.

Lanark was a royal burgh from 1140 to 1975, and was historically the county town of Lanarkshire, though in modern times this title belongs to Hamilton. Notable landmarks nearby include New Lanark, the Corra Linn and the site of Lanark Castle.

Lanark railway station and bus interchange have frequent services to Glasgow. There is little industry in Lanark and some residents commute to work in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Its shops serve the local agricultural community and surrounding villages. There is a large modern livestock auction market on the outskirts of the town.

== History ==

The town&#x27;s name is believed to come from the Cumbric &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;clear space, glade&quot;.

Lanark has served as an important market town since medieval times, and King David I made it a royal burgh in 1140, giving it certain mercantile privileges relating to government and taxation. David I realised that greater prosperity could result from encouraging trade. He decided to create a chain of new towns across Scotland. These would be centres of Norman civilisation in a largely Celtic country, and would be established in such a way as to encourage the development of trade within their area. These new towns were to be known as Burghs. Bastides were established in France for much the same reason.

When a site had been selected for a new town the King&#x27;s surveyors would lay out an area for the town&#x27;s market. Each merchant who came to the town was granted a plot of land (usually rent free for the first few years) bordering on the marketplace. These plots were known as feus or in royal burghs such as Lanark as burgages. Each burgage in a burgh was the same size, though the size varied between burghs. In Forres in the north of Scotland each feu was wide and deep. The layout of the burgages in Lanark can still be easily seen between the north side of Lanark High Street (the former market place) and North Vennel, a lane which runs behind the burgages. A motte and bailey castle was also constructed at the bottom of Castlegate.

Lanark had four town gates, West Port, East port, Wellgate and Castlegate. West Port gate was demolished in the 1770s.

The first aviation meeting to be held in Scotland was held at Lanark Racecourse between 6 and 13 August 1910. This location was chosen because the land was relatively flat, the racecourse already had facilities for a paying public, there were stables to act as hangars for the aeroplanes and the racecourse was accessible by both road and by rail, especially as The Caledonian Railway Company were prepared to construct a new station near the main entrance. The aeroplanes were transported to the meeting by rail, as aviation technology at the time was not advanced enough to safely fly there. The Lanark meeting took place shortly after a similar event in Bournemouth at which Charles Rolls died. Influenced by this, it was decided that no aircraft would fly closer than away from the spectators. For the first time, aeroplanes were accurately timed over a straight measured distance, allowing the first world records to be set, covering flights over . The meeting was described by &quot;The Aero&quot; magazine as &#x27;the most successful yet held in Britain&#x27;.

A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Winston Barracks in the 1930s.

On 29 June 1953, Queen Elizabeth II visited Lanark to mark her coronation.

== Governance ==
The people of Lanark form part of various different constituencies. In local elections, they are the main component of the Clydesdale North ward which elects three representatives to South Lanarkshire Council. In elections to the Scottish Parliament, Lanark elects its representatives as part of the Clydesdale constituency, and also contributes to the election of seven additional list members as part of the South of Scotland region. The current Clydesdale MSP is Aileen Campbell of the SNP, who defeated the Labour incumbent Karen Gillon in the 2011 election after Gillon had held the seat since 1999. In Westminster elections, Lanark is part of the Lanark and Hamilton East constituency. Labour&#x27;s Jimmy Hood represented the area in Parliament from 1987 until 2015; since then the MP has been Angela Crawley. Prior to Brexit in 2020, the town was part of the Scotland constituency which elected six MEPs to the European Parliament.

== Landmarks ==

There are 14 historical closes or vennels in the town - alleyways allowing access to the High street. Some are named after an original shop owner, one is named Wallace close as it depicts key moments of William Wallace&#x27;s life in Lanark 

Visitors to the town can visit the nearby World Heritage Site of New Lanark, close to the Falls of Clyde, the Corehouse estate and the Scottish Wildlife Trust&#x27;s Corehouse Nature Reserve.

The Lanark Museum is located in West Port, inside the YMCA building.

A large boating lake, Lanark Loch, adjoins Lanark Golf Club which has a lovely and historic 18 hole course for more experienced golf players and a 9-hole golf course. The former racecourse now offers pony-trekking activities.

The town&#x27;s Castlebank Park lies near the former site of Lanark Castle, and allows access to the River Clyde and the Clyde Walkway.

An ornate gas lamp, known as the provost&#x27;s lamp stands at the bottom of the High Street. After the burgh council was abolished in 1975, the provost&#x27;s lamp, which had historically been placed outside the house of the provost as one of their marks of office, was relocated to the pavement just to the east of Lanark Tolbooth on a permanent basis.

One of the churches in the town bears the name of The Old Church of St Kentigern (perhaps better known as St Mungo), who set up many medieval churches in the Scottish Lowlands, including Glasgow, and died c.612 AD. The town&#x27;s cemetery stands on the site of The Old Church of St Kentigern, and includes many Covenanter graves.

St. Nicholas Parish Church stands at the bottom of the high street. The church bell is believed to date from 1110, and may be one of the oldest church bells in the world. It was moved from The Old Church of St Kentigern when St. Nicholas Church was built in 1774. It has been recast four times, including 1659 and 1983. There is an 8-foot (2.45 m) statue of William Wallace in the steeple. This was sculpted by Robert Forrest, from an ancient drawing in the possession of the Society of Antiquaries.
== Lanimers ==

This historic background forms the basis for the Lanark Lanimers, which take place each year for one week in June. Local primary schoolchildren elect a Lanimers queen and court; and a Lord Cornet is chosen from local businessmen. On the Monday night the Perambulation of the Marches takes place, when townspeople turn out to walk around half the town boundary, following the Lord Cornets past and present as they inspect the border-stones. Traditionally, the townspeople carry &quot;birks&quot; (Scots for &quot;sticks of birch&quot;), which are small branches of birch trees cut from the woods at the Glenburnie estate. This tradition was started in 1948 by Joseph Doolan, whose family owned the land. The other half of the boundary is inspected on the Wednesday night, again led by the Lord Cornet accompanied by many local riders who participate in the Riding of the Marches, locally referred to as the Rideout. On the Thursday morning, schools and other organisations parade before the Lanimer Queen in themed dress, accompanied by pipe bands. The best Lanimer Lorries win prizes, and after the parade the crowning of the Queen takes place on a temporary stand erected in front of St Nicholas&#x27; Church, under the statue of William Wallace. The Queen holds a reception party in the town&#x27;s Memorial Hall on the Friday night, where children perform songs and dances.

== Notable people ==
William Wallace is one of the most notable people in Lanark&#x27;s history. A key leader in the Scottish Wars of Independence, he is known to have first &quot;drawn his sword to free his native land&quot; at Lanark in 1297, killing the English sheriff Haselrig. An 8-foot statue of Wallace sits on St Nicholas Church at the town cross dating back to 1817 which was sculpted by Carluke-born Robert Forrest.

Other notable figures from Lanark include:

* Robert McQueen, Lord Braxfield (1722–1799), senior Scottish judge known as the &quot;hanging judge&quot;

<doc id="277851" wikidata="Q2248582" url="?curid=277851" title="William Rowley">
<text>William Rowley (c. 1585 – February 1626) was an English Jacobean dramatist, best known for works written in collaboration with more successful writers. His date of birth is estimated to have been c. 1585; he was buried on 11 February 1626 in the graveyard of St James&#x27;s, Clerkenwell in north London. (An unambiguous record of Rowley&#x27;s death was discovered in 1928, but some authorities persist in listing his year of death as 1642.)

==Life and work==
Rowley was an actor-playwright who specialised in playing clown characters (that is, characters whose function is to provide low comedy). He must also have been a large man, since his forte lay specifically in fat-clown roles. He played the Fat Bishop in Thomas Middleton&#x27;s &quot;A Game at Chess&quot;, and Plumporridge in the same author&#x27;s &quot;Inner Temple Masque&quot;. He also wrote fat-clown parts for himself to play: Jaques in &quot;All&#x27;s Lost by Lust&quot; (a role &quot;personated by the Poet&quot;, the 1633 quarto states), and Bustopha in &quot;The Maid in the Mill&quot;, his collaboration with John Fletcher. He certainly played Simplicity in &quot;The World Tossed at Tennis&quot;, and probably Chough in &quot;A Fair Quarrel&quot; – and since these are Middleton/Rowley collaborations, they qualify as two more parts that Rowley wrote for himself. (Internal evidence shows that in collaborations, Rowley normally handled the comic subplot – though he was not restricted solely to comic material: in &quot;The Changeling&quot;, &quot;A Fair Quarrel&quot;, and &quot;The Maid in the Mill&quot; he wrote substantial portions of the main plots as well.) The part of the otherwise unnamed Clown in &quot;The Birth of Merlin&quot; shows signs of being another role that Rowley the playwright wrote with Rowley the actor in mind.

As a writer, Rowley was almost exclusively a dramatist; the pamphlet &quot;A Search for Money&quot; (1609) is his only sustained work of non-dramatic prose. Two plays are generally accepted as Rowley&#x27;s solo works: &quot;A Shoemaker a Gentleman&quot; (c. 1607–09) and &quot;All&#x27;s Lost by Lust&quot; (1619). Three other works that may have been Rowley solo plays have not survived: &quot;Hymen&#x27;s Holidays or Cupid&#x27;s Vagaries&quot; (1612), &quot;A Knave in Print&quot; (1613) and &quot;The Fool Without Book&quot; (also 1613).

Rowley appears to have begun his career working for Queen Anne&#x27;s Men at the Red Bull Theatre. In 1609 he was part of a group of actors who set up a new playing company, the Duke of York&#x27;s Men, which became known as Prince Charles&#x27;s Men after 1612. Most of Rowley&#x27;s career was spent writing and clowning for this company, which was based at a series of different playhouses, including the Curtain, the Hope and the Red Bull. Rowley was the troupe&#x27;s payee for their Court performances in the 1610–15 era.

In 1623, Rowley left his company and joined the highly successful King&#x27;s Men at the Globe, until his death in 1626. Though relatively brief, his stay with the troupe was eventful: in 1624 he was embroiled in both the &quot;Game at Chess&quot; controversy in August and the &quot;Spanish Viceroy&quot; affair in December. The roles he took with the company probably included Cacafogo in &quot;Rule a Wife and Have a Wife&quot;, the Cook in &quot;Rollo Duke of Normandy&quot; and Tony in &quot;A Wife for a Month&quot;.

Notably, Rowley did not necessarily restrict his playwriting efforts to the company to which he was committed as an actor. In 1624 he was a member of the King&#x27;s Men, Shakespeare&#x27;s famous company, and in August of that year played in their notorious production of &quot;A Game at Chess&quot; – yet in the same year he worked on the now-lost play &quot;Keep the Widow Waking&quot; with Dekker, Ford and Webster, which was intended for the Red Bull Theatre.

==Plays by Rowley==
Rowley&#x27;s canon is plagued by uncertainty and by the complexities of collaboration: the following is only an approximate guide.

*&quot;All&#x27;s Lost by Lust&quot; (performed 1618–19; printed 1633)
*&quot;The Birth of Merlin; or, The Child Hath Found its Father&quot; (performed 1622; printed 1662). The title page claims William Shakespeare as Rowley&#x27;s co-writer, but this claim is disputed.
*&quot;The Changeling&quot; (performed 1622; printed 1653). Co-written with Thomas Middleton.
*&quot;A Cure for a Cuckold&quot; (performed 1624; printed 1661). Co-written with John Webster.
*&quot;A Fair Quarrel&quot; (performed 1614–17; printed 1617). Co-written with Thomas Middleton.
*&quot;Fortune by Land and Sea&quot; (performed c. 1607; printed 1655). Co-written with Thomas Heywood.
*&quot;The Maid in the Mill&quot; (performed 1623; printed 1647). Co-written with John Fletcher.
*&quot;A Match at Midnight&quot; (performed c. 1622; printed 1633). Attributed only to &#x27;W. R.&#x27;, and stylistic analysis suggests that it may not be by Rowley.
*&quot;A New Wonder, a Woman Never Vexed&quot; (performed 1610–14; printed 1632). Possibly a collaboration; George Wilkins and Thomas Heywood have been suggested as co-writers.
*&quot;The Old Law, or A New Way to Please You&quot; (performed 1618; printed 1656). Co-written with Thomas Middleton, and, possibly, a third collaborator who may have been Philip Massinger or Thomas Heywood.
*&quot;A Shoemaker a Gentleman&quot; (date of composition unknown; printed 1638)
*&quot;The Spanish Gypsy&quot; (performed 1623; printed 1653). Although the title page attributes this play to Rowley and Thomas Middleton, stylistic analysis favours a different playwriting team: John Ford and Thomas Dekker.
*&quot;The Thracian Wonder&quot; (date of composition unknown; printed 1661). The title page attributes this play to Rowley and John Webster although few readers accept Webster&#x27;s presence.
*&quot;The Travels of the Three English Brothers&quot; (performed and printed 1607). Co-written with George Wilkins and John Day.
*&quot;Wit at Several Weapons&quot; (performed c. 1615; printed 1647). Although it was first printed as part of the Beaumont and Fletcher folio, stylistic analysis suggests that this play was heavily revised by Rowley and Thomas Middleton.
*&quot;The Witch of Edmonton&quot; (performed 1621; published 1658). Co-written with John Ford and Thomas Dekker.
*&quot;The World Tossed at Tennis&quot; (performed and printed 1620). Co-written with Thomas Middleton.

<doc id="277858" wikidata="Q6499202" url="?curid=277858" title="Sears">
<text>Sears, Roebuck and Co., commonly known as Sears ( ), is an American chain of department stores founded in 1892 by Richard Warren Sears and Alvah Curtis Roebuck and reincorporated in 1906 by Richard Sears and Julius Rosenwald, with what began as a mail-order catalog company migrating to opening retail locations in 1925, the first in Chicago. Through the 1980s, Sears was the largest retailer in the United States. In 2005, the company was bought by the management of the American big box discount chain Kmart, which upon completion of the merger, formed Sears Holdings. In 2018, it was the 31st-largest. After several years of declining sales, Sears&#x27; parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 15, 2018. It announced on January 16, 2019, that it had won its bankruptcy auction, and that a reduced number of 425 stores would remain open, including 223 Sears stores.

Sears was based in the Sears Tower in Chicago from 1973 until 1995, and was later headquartered in Hoffman Estates, Illinois from 1993 until 2021, the year when it announced that it would be selling its Hoffman Estates headquarters complex. On December 12, 2022, Sears Authorized Hometown Stores, LLC, and affiliated debtor Sears Hometown, Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and on December 26 announced the liquidation of the 115 largely owner-operated Hometown stores.

==History==

===Beginnings===
Richard Warren Sears was born in 1863 in Stewartville, Minnesota, to a wealthy family which moved to nearby Spring Valley. In 1879, his father died shortly after losing the family fortune in a speculative stock deal. Sears moved across the state to work as a railroad station agent in North Redwood, then Minneapolis.

While he was in North Redwood, a jeweler refused delivery on a shipment of watches. Sears purchased them and sold them at a low price to the station agents, making a profit. He started a mail-order watch business in Minneapolis in 1886, calling it the R.W. Sears Watch Company. That year, he met Alvah Curtis Roebuck, a watch repairman. In 1887, Sears and Roebuck relocated the business to Chicago, and the company published Richard Sears&#x27;s first mail-order catalog, offering watches, diamonds, and jewelry.

In 1889, Sears sold his business for $100,000 ($3 million in 2021 dollars) and relocated to Iowa, planning to be a rural banker. He returned to Chicago in 1892 and established a new mail-order firm, again selling watches and jewelry, with Roebuck as his partner, operating as the A. C. Roebuck watch company. On September 16, 1893, they renamed the company Sears, Roebuck, and Co. and began to diversify the product lines offered in their catalogs.

Before the Sears catalog, farmers near small rural towns usually purchased supplies, often at high prices and on credit, from local general stores with narrow selections of goods. Prices were negotiated and relied on the storekeeper&#x27;s estimate of a customer&#x27;s creditworthiness. Sears built an opposite business model by offering in their catalogs a larger selection of products at published prices.

By 1894, the Sears catalog had grown to 322 pages, including many new items, such as sewing machines, bicycles, sporting goods and automobiles (later produced, from 1905 to 1915, by Lincoln Motor Car Works of Chicago [no relation to the current Ford line]). By 1895, the company was producing a 532-page catalog. Sales were over $400,000 ($12 million in 2021 dollars) in 1893 and over $750,000 ($20 million in 2021 dollars) two years later. By 1896, dolls, stoves, and groceries were added to the catalog.

Despite the strong and growing sales, the national Panic of 1893 led to a full-scale economic depression, causing a cash squeeze and large quantities of unsold merchandise by 1895. Roebuck decided to quit, returning later in a publicity role. Sears offered Roebuck&#x27;s half of the company to Chicago businessman Aaron Nusbaum, who in turn brought in his brother-in-law Julius Rosenwald, to whom Sears owed money. In August 1895, they bought Roebuck&#x27;s half of the company for $75,000 ($ million today), and that month the company was reincorporated in Illinois with a capital stock of $150,000 ($ million today). The transaction was handled by Albert Henry Loeb of Chicago law firm Loeb &amp; Adler (now Arnstein &amp; Lehr); copies of the transaction are still displayed on the firm&#x27;s walls.

===Early 20th century===

Sears and Rosenwald got along well with each other, but not with Nusbaum; they bought his interest in the firm for $1.3 million in 1903 ($ million today). Rosenwald brought to the mail-order firm a rational management philosophy and diversified product lines: dry goods, consumer durables, drugs, hardware, furniture, and nearly anything else a farm household could desire.

Sales continued to proliferate, and the prosperity of the company and their vision for more significant expansion led Sears and Rosenwald to take the company public in 1906, with a stock placement of $40 million ($ billion today). They had to incorporate a new company to bring the operation public; Sears and Rosenwald established Sears, Roebuck and Company with the legal name Sears, Roebuck and Co., in the state of New York, which effectively replaced the original company. The current company inherits the history of the old company, celebrating the original 1892 incorporation, rather than the 1906 revision, as the start of the company.

Sears&#x27;s successful 1906 initial public offering (IPO) marks the first major retail IPO in American financial history and represented a coming of age, financially, of the consumer sector. The company traded under the ticker symbol S and was a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1924 to 1999.

In 1906, Sears opened its catalog plant and the Sears Merchandise Building Tower in Chicago&#x27;s West Side. The building was the anchor of what would become the massive Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex of offices, laboratories, and mail-order operations at Homan Avenue and Arthington Street. The complex served as corporate headquarters until 1973 when the Sears Tower was completed and served as the base of the mail-order catalog business until 1995.

By 1907, under Rosenwald&#x27;s leadership as vice president and treasurer, annual sales of the company climbed to roughly $50 million ($ billion today). Sears resigned from the presidency in 1908 due to declining health, with Rosenwald named president and chairman of the board and taking on full control.

In 1910, Sears acquired the David Bradley Plow company. This acquisition would lead to the manufacturing of riding mowers, chainsaws, tillers, etc., in the Bradley Illinois factory.

The company was badly hurt during 1919–21 as a severe depression hit the nation&#x27;s farms after farmers had over-expanded their holdings. To bail out the company, Rosenwald pledged $21 million ($ million today) of his personal wealth in 1921. By 1922, Sears regained financial stability.

===Boom years===


==== Brick and mortar ====
Rosenwald decided to shift emphasis to urban America and brought in Robert E. Wood to take charge. 
Rosenwald oversaw the design and construction of the firm&#x27;s first department store, built on land within the Sears, Roebuck, and Company Complex. The store opened in 1925. In 1924, Rosenwald resigned the presidency but remained as chair until he died in 1932; his goal was to devote more time to philanthropy.

The first store opened on February 2, 1925, as an experiment in the North Lawndale Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex. Despite its remote location on the outskirts of Chicago, its success led to dozens of further openings across the country, many in conjunction with the company&#x27;s mail-order offices, typically in lower-middle-class and working-class neighborhoods, far from the main downtown shopping district. This was considered highly unconventional at a time when shopping was concentrated in city centers, but through World War II, there was an extensive streetcar network in Chicago and other U.S. cities. However, rapidly increasing car ownership and the brand&#x27;s huge popularity helped attract customers.

Sears retail stores were pioneering and broke the conventions of the time in three ways: 
*their location away from central shopping districts, 
*innovative store design, and 
*unconventional product mix and retailing practices. 
Many stores at this time were designed by architect George C. Nimmons and his firms. The architecture was driven by merchandising needs rather than the desired outer appearance. This made the stores excellent examples of the modern architecture of the time—styles made famous by Bertram Goodhue and Eliel Saarinen.

Its stores were oriented to motorists. Set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience, they had ample, free, off-street parking and communicated a clear corporate identity. In the 1930s, the company designed fully air-conditioned, &quot;windowless&quot; stores, such as Sears-Pico in 1939 in Los Angeles, which was the first to have an open plan selling floor (instead of breaking up the floor into discrete sections).

Sears was also a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men and women. The stores included hardware and building materials. It de-emphasized the latest clothing fashions in favor of practical and durable clothing and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk.

====Catalog====
In 1933, Sears issued the first of its Christmas catalogs known as the &quot;Sears Wishbook&quot;, a catalog featuring toys and gifts, separate from the annual Christmas Catalog. From 1908 to 1940, it included ready-to-assemble Sears Catalog Home kit houses.

==== Americas====

Sears opened a small store in Downtown Havana, Cuba in 1942. Sears opened its first store in Mexico City in 1947; the Mexican stores would later spin off into Sears Mexico, now owned by billionaire Carlos Slim&#x27;s Grupo Sanborns, which in 2020 operated more than 75 stores across Mexico.

Sears had sales of US$78 million in other territories in 1953. Over time, Sears expanded into all Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Peru, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and all Central American countries. Currently Sears operates in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Puerto Rico.

====Expansion====
From the 1920s to the 1950s, Sears built many urban department stores in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico (apart from, but not far from, existing central business districts), and they overshadowed the mail-order business. Following World War II, the company expanded into suburban markets and malls. In 1959, it had formed the Homart Development Company for developing malls. Many of the company&#x27;s stores have undergone major renovations or replacements since the 1980s. Sears began to diversify in the 1930s, creating Allstate Insurance Company in 1931 and placing Allstate representatives in its stores in 1934 (Allstate was also used as a house brand on a range of motorized vehicles sold by Sears). Over the decades, it established major national brands, such as Kenmore, Craftsman, DieHard, Silvertone, Supertone, and Toughskins — and marketed widely under its private labels, e.g., marketing the &quot;Sears Archer 600&quot; typewriter as a rebranded Silverette model, manufactured by Silver Seiko Ltd. of Japan.

The success of Sears outdoor products raised the attention of the Federal Government and the antitrust laws. Sears purchased David Bradley to manufacture farm and lawn equipment. Its success was broken up in 1962 as they sold more plows than John Deere. Sears sold half of the David Bradley factory in Bradley, Illinois to the Newark Ohio Company that was shortly acquired by Roper Industries.

====1970s pinnacle====
Sears reached its pinnacle in the 1970s. In 1974, Sears completed the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago, which became the world&#x27;s tallest building, a title it took from the former Twin Towers in New York. Upon moving out of Chicago, Sears sold the Sears Tower in 1988. In the sale contract of the tower, Sears retained its naming rights to the building until 2003, but the Sears Tower retained the name until early 2009, when London-based insurer Willis Group Holdings, Ltd. was given the building&#x27;s naming rights to encourage them to occupy the building. Sears moved to the new Prairie Stone Business Park in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, between 1993 and 1995. The Sears Centre is a 10,001-seat multi-purpose arena located in Hoffman Estates adjacent to the Prairie Stone campus.

==== Mail order ====
The Sears catalog became known in the industry as &quot;the Consumers&#x27; Bible&quot;. The company began selling to foreign customers after the American occupation of Greenland in World War II and the Philippines, among others, when locals ordered from catalogs left by soldiers. Novelists and story writers often portrayed the importance of the catalog in the emotional lives of rural folk. The catalog also entered the language, particularly of rural dwellers, as a euphemism for toilet paper, as its pages could be torn out and used as such. In addition, for many rural African-Americans, especially in areas dominated by Jim Crow racial segregation, the Sears catalog was a vital retail alternative to local white-population-dominated stores, bypassing the stores&#x27; frequent intention to deny them fair access to their merchandise.

However, as the nation urbanized, Sears&#x27;s catalog business faced competition from city department stores. Rural America&#x27;s population was slow-growing and possessed far less spending power than urban America.

===Decline===
In the 1980s, the company began to diversify into non-retail entities such as buying Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker in 1981. In 1984, it launched Prodigy as a joint venture with IBM, and introduced the Discover credit card in 1985. However, these actions have been said to have distracted management&#x27;s attention from the core retail business and allowed competing retailers to gain significant ground, culminating with Walmart surpassing Sears as the largest retailer in the United States in 1990.

In the 1990s, the company began divesting itself of many non-retail entities, which were detrimental to its bottom line. Sears spun off its financial services arm, which included brokerage business Dean Witter Reynolds and Discover Card. It sold its mall building subsidiary Homart to General Growth Properties in 1995. Sears later acquired hardware chain Orchard Supply Hardware in 1996 and started home improvement store The Great Indoors in 1997.

The cost of distributing the once highly influential general merchandise catalog became prohibitive; sales and profits had declined. The company discontinued the catalog in 1993. It dismissed 50,000 workers who had filled the orders. In 1992, the company posted a $3.9 billion loss, the largest ever from an American retailer.

In 1992, California successfully sued the company for falsely finding things wrong with automobiles in for repair for other reasons. In 1997, criminal charges were made. In 1998, Sears announced it had sold the remnants of Western Auto (which it had acquired in 1998) to Roanoke-based Advance Auto Parts. The business deal was not what experts in the after-market automotive industry expected: Sears, Roebuck became &quot;one of the largest shareholders&quot; after obtaining a 40% stake in Advance Auto Parts and merging their two store networks, which included Western Auto&#x27;s wholesale and retail operations. The existing store network of Advance Auto Parts, comprising 915 stores in 17 U.S. states, merged with 590 U.S.-based Parts America Stores in addition to 40 Western Auto stores in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. In 1997, Sears sold 85% of its Mexico affiliate to Grupo Carso. Sears Holdings continued to produce specialty catalogs and reintroduced a smaller version of the Holiday Wish Book in 2007.

In 2003, Sears sold its U.S. retail credit card operation to Citibank. The remaining card operations for Sears Canada were sold to JPMorgan Chase in August 2005. In 2003, Sears opened a new concept store called Sears Grand. Sears Grand stores carried everything that a regular Sears carries, and more. Sears Grand stores were about .

On November 17, 2004, Kmart Holdings Corporation announced it would acquire Sears, Roebuck, and Co. for $11 billion after Kmart completed its recovery from bankruptcy. As a part of the acquisition, Kmart Holding Corporation, along with Sears, Roebuck, and Co., was transformed into the new Sears Holdings Corporation. The new company started trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange as SHLD; Sears sold its single-letter ticker symbol &#x27;S&#x27; in the New York Stock Exchange that it had held since 1910 to Sprint Corporation. The new corporation announced that it would continue to operate stores under both the Sears and Kmart brands. In 2005, the company began renovating some Kmart stores and converting them to the Sears Essentials format, only to change them later to Sears Grands. The combined company&#x27;s profits peaked at $1.5 billion in 2006.

By 2010, the company was no longer profitable; from 2011 to 2016, the company lost $10.4 billion. In 2014, its total debt ($4.2 billion at the end of January 2017) exceeded its market capitalization ($974.1 million as of March 21, 2017). Sears declined from more than 3,500 physical stores to 695 U.S. stores from 2010 to 2017. Sales at Sears stores dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.

Sears spent much of 2014 and 2015 selling off portions of its balance sheet; namely, Lands&#x27; End and its stake in Sears Canada, one of the biggest e-commerce players in Canada, with Can$505 million in sales in 2015—more than Walmart and others who had begun pushing aggressively into online sales, such as Canadian Tire. Sears stated that the company was looking to focus on becoming a more tech-driven retailer. Sears&#x27;s CEO and top shareholder said the sell-off of key assets in the last year had given the retailer the money it needs to speed up its transformation. Sears Holdings had lost a total of US$7 billion in the four years to 2015. In part, the retailer was trying to curb losses by using a loyalty program called Shop Your Way. Sears believed the membership scheme would enhance repeat business and customer loyalty in the long term.

CEO Eddie Lampert also concluded an arrangement that sold the Craftsman brand to Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc. for approximately US$900 million. In October 2017, Sears and appliance manufacturer Whirlpool Corporation ended their 101-year-old association, reportedly due to pricing issues, although Whirlpool continued supplying Sears with Kenmore-branded appliances. In May 2018, Sears announced it had formed a &quot;special committee&quot; to explore the sale of Kenmore.

===Bankruptcy and current operations===
On September 24, 2018, the retailer&#x27;s CEO warned that the company was &quot;running out of time&quot; to salvage its business. Sears Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 15, 2018, ahead of a $134 million debt payment due that day. On November 23, 2018, Sears Holdings released a list of 505 stores, including 266 Sears stores, that were for sale in the bankruptcy process, while all others would hold liquidation sales.

On January 16, 2019, Sears Holdings announced it would remain open after Lampert won a bankruptcy auction for the company with an offer to keep about 400 stores open. On February 7, 2019, a bankruptcy judge approved a $5.2 billion plan by Sears&#x27;s chairman and biggest shareholder to keep the business going. The approval meant roughly 425 stores, including 223 Sears stores, and 45,000 jobs would be preserved.

In April 2019, Sears announced the opening of three new stores with a limited set of merchandise under the name Sears Home &amp; Life. Also that month, Sears closed its store at Windward Mall in Kaneohe, Hawaii, and its store at Oakbrook Center in Oak Brook, Illinois (which was razed and already rebuilt as a 1-story store), making it the first post-bankruptcy closure for the brand since being bought by ESL.

On June 3, 2019, the company announced that Transform Holdco would acquire Sears Hometown &amp; Outlet Stores. As per deal, it might need to divest its Sears Outlet division to gain approval. On August 7, 2019, it was announced that 26 stores would close that October, including 21 Sears stores, among them the last Sears stores in Alabama and West Virginia, at Riverchase Galleria in Hoover and at Huntington Mall in Barboursville, respectively. The announcement also included plans to &quot;accelerate the expansion of our smaller store formats which includes opening additional Home &amp; Life stores and adding several hundred Sears Hometown stores after the Sears Hometown and Outlet transaction closes.&quot; On August 31, 2019, management announced that Transform would close an additional 92 stores, including 15 Sears stores, by the end of 2019. Near the end of 2019, Sears sold the brand name DieHard to Advance Auto Parts for $200 million.

A total of 100 more stores closed by December 2019. 51 Sears stores were closed in February 2020. More stores continued to close throughout 2020 and 2021 including the final Sears in Maine at The Maine Mall.
In September 2021, the company&#x27;s website listed 35 Sears stores. That month, Sears announced that it would close more stores, including the last Sears store in New York City. The New York City Sears closed by November 24, 2021, with the potential to be redeveloped. Transformco announced in December 2021 its plans to sell the Sears headquarters in Hoffman Estates, which includes of undeveloped land.

On January 19, 2022, Sears shut the remaining 15 Sears Auto Centers in the United States.

In May 2022, it was announced that roughly 100 more Sears Hometown stores, including the last four in Michigan, would close permanently. On December 13, 2022, Sears Hometown filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was later revealed that all remaining Sears Hometown stores would be liquidated and permanently closed.

 there were eight Sears stores remaining, with seven in the mainland U.S. and one location in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. The company&#x27;s U.S. website, Sears.com, remains active for online purchases.

The most recent Sears store closing, in Tukwila, Washington, occurred on December 15, 2024.

==Corporate affairs==

===Logo===
===Sponsorships===
Before the company filed for bankruptcy, Sears sponsored many entertainment and sporting events.

From 2006 until 2020, it had the naming rights to an 11,000-seat multi-purpose family entertainment, cultural and sports center in Hoffman Estates, the Now Arena.

The company sponsored the television series &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;. The company also underwrote the PBS television series &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, under the name The Sears-Roebuck Foundation, from the show&#x27;s premiere in 1968 until 1992.

Through the Sears Auto Centers, the company sponsored the Formula Drift Darren McNamara Sears/Falken Saturn Sky drift car. It sponsored the NASCAR Truck Series, using the Craftsman brand as the title sponsor, from the series&#x27; inception in the 1995 NASCAR SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman to the 2008 season, when the agreement ended. It sponsored the #10 Gillett Evernham Motorsports car of Scott Riggs for the September 2, 2007, running of the Sharp AQUOS 500 at California Speedway through its Sears Auto Center branch. However, Riggs failed to qualify for the event. In 2016, Craftsman became the title sponsor of the World Racing Group, World of Outlaws Sprint car racing series.

===Employee relations===
Sears has struggled with employee relations. One notable example was the shift in 1992 from an hourly wage based on longevity to a base wage (usually between US$3.50 and US$6 per hour) and commissions ranging from 0.5% to 11%. Sears said the new base wage, often constituting a substantial (up to 40%) cut in pay, was done &quot;to be successful in this highly competitive environment&quot;.

In early October 2007, Sears cut commission rates for employees in some departments to between 0.5% and 4% but equalized the base wage across all Home Improvement and Electronics departments. In 2011, commission rates on non-base items were cut by 2% in the electronics department. In late 2009, the electronic department&#x27;s commission on &quot;base items&quot; was cut to 1%. As of 2017, appliances is the only remaining department where compensation is based entirely on commission. Other departments give a base pay plus commission. In many stores, jewelry department associates receive a low base salary with a 1% commission on their sales.

In March 2019, Sears said that it was ending life insurance benefits for an undisclosed number of its 90,000 retirees. A few months earlier, the company had handed out over $25 million in bonuses to executives. This key Sears Retiree Benefit was worth between $5,000 and $15,000 for most of the pool (29,000) of eligible retired employees.

In May 2019, former Sears Holdings chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert, months after purchasing the remains of Sears from the holding company, threatened not to pay out the $43 million in pension payments owed to 90,000 former Sears and Kmart employees and retirees. A &quot;Forbes&quot; editorial pointed out that Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury at the time, was a board member of Sears Holding until 2016 and was, at the time, one of three directors of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which manages administration of pensions for defunct or bankrupt businesses.

==Data breaches==
===2017===
Between September 26 and October 12, 2017, malware were installed in the computers operated by a service provider for sears.com and kmart.com e-commerce sites in which the credit card information of 100,000 customers were exposed via a malicious script. The breach was not publicly announced until April 2024.

===2021===
In 2021, an unauthorized party accessed Transformco computer servers between June 3 and June 15 that held employee payroll and healthcare information that affected current and past Sears and other Transformco employees.

<text>The Papillon (, French for &#x27;butterfly[-eared]&#x27;), also called the Continental Toy Spaniel, is a breed of dog, of the spaniel type. One of the oldest of the toy spaniels, it derives its name from its characteristic butterfly-like look of the long and fringed hair on the ears. A Papillon with dropped ears is called a Phalene.

== Appearance and behavior ==
Papillons are very intelligent and self-assured dogs that have a very easy time learning new tricks. These dogs can be sociable with children and strangers, but are generally reserved around new people. They can also be socialized to get along well with other pets, but care should be taken with rambunctious pets or cats with claws, as they may injure them. If not properly socialized, Papillons can be distrustful and exhibit aggressive tendencies toward other dogs and people. Papillons may also be very playful and affectionate. Widely known as great companion dogs, they have the spirit and energy to keep up with active families, but can also be calm enough to be happy with sleeping in the arms of an equally affectionate owner. Due to their high energy level, they demand an augmented exercise routine, relative to the average companion breed. Papillons are known as excellent watchdogs, as they will alert their owner to changes in their environment. They may be considered garrulous like many other toy dogs. They can withstand heat, but are more sensitive to cold temperatures because of their single-coated fur, and should not be left outside unattended in cold weather.

The most iconic aspect of Papillons are their ears, which are large and well fringed, giving them a butterfly-wing-like appearance. Papillons are particolored or white with patches of any color. An all-white dog or a dog with no white is disqualified from the conformation show ring. A blaze (area of white extending down between the eyes) and noseband is preferred over a solid-colored head, but not required. Nose, eye rims, and lips should be black. Paw pads vary in color from black to pink, depending on the coloring of the dog.

Papillons can be registered with the American Kennel Club as the following colors and markings, with types for show purposes indicated with S for standard or A for alternate:
The American Kennel Club breed standard indicates a conformance fault that may be penalized: failure of the non-white color to cover the front and back of both ears and to extend from the ears over both eyes. Not penalized are a slight extension of the white collar onto the base of the ears, or a few white hairs interspersed in the color – as long as &quot;the butterfly appearance is not sacrificed&quot;.

Two ear variations of this breed are seen, the completely upright ears of the more common Papillon, and the dropped spaniel-like ears of the Phalène. The Phalène are likely a throwback to their spaniel ancestors. The American Kennel Club and the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) consider the Phalène and the Papillon the same breed.

==Temperament==

The temperament of Papillons is that of a happy, friendly, adventurous dog. They are generally neither shy nor aggressive. Papillons can make excellent family dogs, but should be watched around little children, as should any dog, due to a small child&#x27;s lack of understanding of a dog&#x27;s behavior and the likelihood that they will do something to upset the dog. Given the intelligence of Papillons, they require rigorous training and mental stimulation to prevent behavioral issues arising from boredom. According to Dr Stanley Coren, an expert on animal intelligence, Papillons are among the top ten brightest dogs, ranking 8th out of 138 breeds tested.
==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 14.5 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Papillons have only minor health concerns, although patellar luxation, seizures, and dental problems can be issues. Additionally, they can be at risk for progressive retinal atrophy, intervertebral disk disease, and allergies.

===Exercise===
Play will take care of a lot of their exercise needs; however, as with all breeds, play is not sufficient for all exercise. Daily walks or runs are an excellent way to exercise a Papillon. They also enjoy a good romp in a safe open area off leash, such as a large, fenced yard. Papillons are a very active breed of dog and enjoy having a job to perform. Papillon breeders recommend dog agility, rally obedience, or obedience training for Papillons because of their intelligence and energy level.

==History==
The history of the Papillon is traced through works of art. The earliest toy spaniels resembling the papillon are found in Italy. Titian painted these small dogs in many famous paintings beginning around 1500, including the &quot;Venus of Urbino&quot; (1542). Other well-known artists who included them in paintings are Watteau, Gonzales Coques, Fragonard, Paolo Veronese, and Mignard. In a painting after Largillierre in the Wallace Collection in London, a Papillon is clearly shown in a family portrait of Louis XIV. Papillons are also in paintings of royal families around Europe and paintings of merchant-class families. The breed was popular in England, France, and Belgium, which are considered countries of origin by the FCI.

The &quot;Titian spaniels&quot; and those portrayed by later artists through Mignard and his contemporaries had the drooping ears characteristic of today&#x27;s Phalène; the erect-eared appearance did not become fashionable until the end of the 19th century. The Titian spaniels were also exclusively red-and-white in coloration, in contrast to the many recognized colorations of today&#x27;s Papillon.

The Papillon&#x27;s history and long association with royalty have led to many stories about the breed. Marie Antoinette is said to have walked to the guillotine clutching her small dog under her arm, likely an apocryphal tale. However, tradition has it that Marie Antoinette&#x27;s dog was a small spaniel that had been brought to the French court from Spain on the back of pack mules. According to the story, her pup was spared and cared for in a building in Paris still called the Papillon House. Marie Antoinette&#x27;s dog was said to have descended from a very old drop-eared breed known as the Epagneul Nain, or Continental Dwarf/Toy Spaniel that appeared in church frescos and paintings as early as the 13th century.

The Papillon is still officially referred to as the Epagneul Nain (ENC) in non-English-speaking countries. The name Squirrel Spaniel also has been used, most likely referring to an earlier standard in which the tail set is described as &quot;curling over the back as a squirrel&#x27;s&quot;. One version of the history of the two varieties of ear shape in the ENC (&quot;papillon&quot; to denote the erect ear and &quot;phalène&quot; to denote the dropped ear) is that toward the end of the 19th century, breed fanciers bred a version of the spaniel whose ears stood up. This dog was said to have been nicknamed &quot;papillon&quot; based on the impressively large, erect ears that resembled the wings of a butterfly. The drop-eared variety of the breed came to be called the Phalène (which means &quot;night moth&quot;). Both types are still bred today and appear in the same litter. The papillon variety is much more common, although recently, the Phalène has undergone a resurgence in popularity.

The Papillon was first recognized by the AKC in 1935 with the formation of the Papillon Club of America. By the end of World War 2, the club was no longer functioning, but it was reactivated in 1948, with its first postwar specialty held in September 1954. In 1999, Ch. Loteki Supernatural Being (call name &quot;Kirby&quot;) owned and handled by John Oulton of Norwalk, Connecticut, became the first Papillon to win the prestigious &quot;Best in Show&quot; at the annual Westminster Kennel Club dog show. Kirby also won international success for the breed by taking the World Dog Show in Helsinki, Finland, and the Royal Invitational in Canada in 1998. Papillons also enjoy success today in competitive fields outside of conformation, including obedience and agility.

In 2019, Planet Waves Forever Young Daydream Believers (call name &quot;Dylan&quot;) became the first Papillon to win Best in Show at Crufts.

<text>The family Dipluridae, known as curtain-web spiders (or confusingly as funnel-web tarantulas, a name shared with other distantly related families) are a group of spiders in the infraorder Mygalomorphae, that have two pairs of booklungs, and chelicerae (fangs) that move up and down in a stabbing motion. A number of genera, including that of the Sydney funnel-web spider (&quot;Atrax&quot;), used to be classified in this family but have now been moved to Atracidae.

==Description==
Dipluridae lack rastella (stout conical spines on their chelicerae). Their carapace is characterized by the head region not being higher than the thoracic region. Their posterior median spinnerets (silk-extruding organs) are much shorter than their posterior lateral spinnerets, which have three segments, and are elongated (almost as long as their opisthosoma). Most of the species are medium to small-sized spiders; some may measure about 15 mm. The cave species &quot;Masteria caeca&quot; is eyeless.

==Biology==
Members of this family often build rather messy funnel-webs. Some build silk-lined burrows instead of webs (&quot;Diplura&quot;, &quot;Trechona&quot;, &quot;Harpathele&quot;, some &quot;Linothele&quot; sp.). They generally build their retreats in crevices in earthen banks, the bark of trees, under logs or in leaf litter.

==Distribution==
As circumscribed , the family is mostly found in South America and the Caribbean, with some genera found in Australia and Oceania.

==Genera==
, the World Spider Catalog accepted the following genera:

*&quot;Diplura&quot; — South America
*&quot;Harmonicon&quot; — Brazil
*&quot;Harpathele&quot; — Brazil
*&quot;Linothele&quot; — South America
*&quot;Masteria&quot; — South America, Caribbean, Philippines, Central America, Oceania
*&quot;Siremata&quot; — Brazil
*&quot;Striamea&quot; — Colombia
*&quot;Trechona&quot; — Brazil
===Transferred to other families===
The following genera are now placed in other families (elevated from subfamilies):

<text>Macy&#x27;s (originally R. H. Macy &amp; Co.) is an American department store chain founded in 1858 by Rowland Hussey Macy. It has been a sister brand to the Bloomingdale&#x27;s department store chain since being acquired by holding company Federated Department Stores in 1994, which renamed itself Macy&#x27;s, Inc. in 2007. It is the largest department store company by retail sales in the United States 

Macy&#x27;s operates with 508 stores in the United States. Its flagship store is located at Herald Square in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The company had 94,000 employees and an annual revenue of $25.3 billion as of January 2023.

Macy&#x27;s has conducted the annual Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City since 1924 and has sponsored the city&#x27;s annual Macy&#x27;s 4th of July Fireworks since 1976. Macy&#x27;s Herald Square is one of the largest department stores in the world. The flagship store covers almost an entire New York City block, features about of retail space, includes additional space for offices and storage, and serves as the endpoint for the Thanksgiving Day parade. The value of Herald Square alone is estimated at $3 billion.

In August 2021, WHP Global announced that Toys &quot;R&quot; Us is opening 400+ stores within Macy&#x27;s starting in 2022. In recent years, the brand has opened new stores under the &quot;Market By Macy&#x27;s&quot; monicker. In January 2025 the company announced that it was set to close 66 store locations, including its landmark stores in Manhattan, Philadelphia and Brooklyn. 

==Beginnings==
===19th century===
Rowland Hussey Macy opened four retail dry goods stores between 1843 and 1855. One of them was the original Macy&#x27;s store in downtown Haverhill, Massachusetts; it opened in 1851 to serve the mill industry employees of the area. They all failed, but he learned from his mistakes. Macy moved to New York City in 1858, to establish a new store named &quot;R. H. Macy &amp; Co.&quot; on Sixth Avenue between 13th and 14th Streets. The location was far north of where other dry goods stores were at the time. On the company&#x27;s first day of business on October 28, 1858, sales totaled $11.08, equal to $ today. The branding emblem at the onset of the 1858 store was a rooster. The red star did not appear to replace it until 1862.

As the business grew, Macy&#x27;s expanded into neighboring buildings, opening more and more departments. The store used publicity devices such as a store Santa Claus, themed exhibits, and illuminated window displays to draw in customers. It also offered a money-back guarantee, although it accepted only cash into the 1950s. The store also produced its in-house made-to-measure clothing for both men and women, assembled in an on-site factory.

In 1875, Macy took on two partners, Robert M. Valentine (1850–1879), a nephew; and Abiel T. La Forge (1842–1878) of Wisconsin, who was the husband of a cousin. Macy died in 1877 from inflammatory kidney disease (then known as Bright&#x27;s disease). La Forge died the following year, and Valentine died in 1879. Ownership of the company remained in the Macy family until 1895, when the Straus brothers, Isidor and Nathan, acquired the company (now called &quot;R. H. Macy &amp; Co.&quot;). Isidor Straus and his brother Nathan Straus had previously held a license to sell china and other goods in the Macy&#x27;s store.

===20th century===
====Construction of Macy&#x27;s Herald Square====

In 1902, the flagship store moved uptown to Herald Square at 34th Street and Broadway, so far north of the other main dry goods emporia that it had to offer a steam wagonette to transport customers from 14th Street to 34th Street. Although the Herald Square store initially consisted of just one building, it expanded through new construction, eventually occupying almost the entire block bounded by Seventh Avenue on the west, Broadway on the east, 34th Street on the south and 35th Street on the north, with the exception of a small pre-existing building on the corner of 35th Street and Seventh Avenue and another on the corner of 34th Street and Broadway. This latter 5-story building was purchased by Robert H. Smith in 1900 for $375,000 (equivalent to $ in 2025) with the idea of getting in the way of Macy&#x27;s becoming the largest store in the world: it is largely supposed that Smith, who was a neighbor of the Macy&#x27;s store on 14th Street, was acting on behalf of Siegel-Cooper, which had built what they thought was the world&#x27;s largest store on Sixth Avenue in 1896. Macy&#x27;s ignored the tactic, and simply built around the building, which now carries Macy&#x27;s &quot;shopping bag&quot; sign by lease arrangement. In 1912, Isidor Straus died in the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; at the age of 67 with his wife, Ida.

The original Broadway store was designed by architects De Lemos &amp; Cordes, was built in 1901–02 by the Fuller Company and has a Palladian facade, but has been updated in many details. There were further additions to the west in 1924 and 1928, and the Seventh Avenue building in 1931, all designed by architect Robert D. Kohn, the newer buildings were increasingly Art Deco in style. In 2012, Macy&#x27;s began the first full renovation of the iconic Herald Square flagship store at a reported cost of $400 million. Studio V Architecture, a New York-based firm, was the overall Master Plan architect of the project. Studio V&#x27;s design raised controversy over the nature of contemporary design and authentic restoration.

The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1978.

====National expansion====

Macy&#x27;s opened their first branch store outside their 34th Street location in the Parkchester development in The Bronx, on October 13, 1941.

The company also acquired local department store chains across the country, including Lasalle &amp; Koch (Toledo, 1923), Davison-Paxon-Stokes (Atlanta, 1929), L. Bamberger &amp; Co. (Newark, 1929), O&#x27;Connor Moffat &amp; Company (San Francisco, 1945) and John Taylor Dry Goods Co. (Kansas City, 1947). O&#x27;Connor Moffat was renamed Macy&#x27;s San Francisco in 1947, later becoming Macy&#x27;s California, and John Taylor was renamed Macy&#x27;s Missouri-Kansas in 1949. Stores in Toledo retained the Lasalle&#x27;s name until 1981, joining the Missouri-Kansas stores to become Macy&#x27;s Midwest. The Toledo stores were sold to Elder-Beerman in 1986.

In 1965, Macy&#x27;s opened a large branch store on Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst, in the New York City borough of Queens. The owner of a small house on the corner refused to sell his land. As a result, a round department store was constructed on 90 percent of the lot. The building has since been converted to the Queens Place mall, though Macy&#x27;s Furniture Gallery remains in a portion as a tenant. 

Macy&#x27;s New York began opening stores outside of its historic New York City–Long Island trade area in 1983 with a location at Aventura Mall in Aventura, Florida (a suburb of Miami), followed by several locations in Plantation, Florida (now relocated from the Fashion Mall to the Broward Mall since the Burdines acquisition), Houston, New Orleans, and Dallas. Davison&#x27;s in Atlanta was renamed Macy&#x27;s Atlanta in early 1985 with the consolidation of an early incarnation of Macy&#x27;s Midwest (former Taylor and Lasalle&#x27;s stores in Kansas City and Toledo, respectively), but late in 1985, Macy&#x27;s sold the former Midwest locations. Bamberger&#x27;s, which had aggressively expanded throughout New Jersey, into the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan area in the 1960s and 1970s as well as into Nanuet, New York (southern Rockland County), and into the Baltimore metropolitan area in the early 1980s, was renamed Macy&#x27;s New Jersey in 1986.

==History under Federated==
===1986–1993: Attempted buyouts and bankruptcy===

In 1986 Edward Finkelstein, Chairman &amp; CEO of R. H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc., led a leveraged buy-out of the company and subsequently engaged in a takeover battle for Federated Department Stores, Inc., in 1988 that he lost to Canada&#x27;s Campeau Corporation. As part of its settlement with Campeau, Macy&#x27;s purchased Federated&#x27;s California-based, fashion-oriented Bullock&#x27;s and its high-end Bullocks Wilshire and I. Magnin divisions. It followed with a reorganization of its divisions into Macy&#x27;s Northeast (former Macy&#x27;s New York and Macy&#x27;s New Jersey), Macy&#x27;s South/Bullock&#x27;s (Macy&#x27;s Atlanta stores plus Macy&#x27;s New York&#x27;s operations in Texas, Florida and Louisiana), and Macy&#x27;s California, the latter including a semi-autonomous I. Magnin/Bullocks Wilshire organization. The Bullocks Wilshire stores were renamed I. Magnin in 1989. Subsequently, R. H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 27, 1992, after which point its banks brought in a new management team, which shut several underperforming stores, jettisoned two-thirds of the luxury I. Magnin chain, and reduced Macy&#x27;s to two divisions, Macy&#x27;s East and Macy&#x27;s West.

Macy&#x27;s East, New York City was a division of Macy&#x27;s, Inc. It is the operating successor to the original R.H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc. and operates the Macy&#x27;s department stores in the northeast U.S. and Puerto Rico. Over the years it has been known as Macy&#x27;s New York and Macy&#x27;s Northeast. On February 1, 2006, Macy&#x27;s East assumed operating control over the Filene&#x27;s, Strawbridge&#x27;s, many of the Kaufmann&#x27;s stores in upstate New York and the Hecht&#x27;s stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland, D.C. and northern Virginia. These locations assumed the Macy&#x27;s moniker officially on September 9, 2006. In 2008 Macy&#x27;s East took over the small Macy&#x27;s North division.

In May 1993, Macy&#x27;s announced the planned fall 1994 launch of TV Macy&#x27;s, the retailer&#x27;s own home shopping channel, in conjunction with Don Hewitt, Thomas Leahy and Cablevision.

===1994–2005: Acquisition by Federated===
R. H. Macy &amp; Co. merged with Federated Department Stores in December 1994. Following the merger, the reorganized Macy&#x27;s moved its headquarters to Cincinnati, Ohio. Federated promptly shut down the remainder of the I. Magnin chain, converting several to Macy&#x27;s or Bullock&#x27;s and selling four in Carmel, Beverly Hills, San Diego and Phoenix to Saks Fifth Avenue. Federated also merged its Abraham &amp; Straus/Jordan Marsh division with the new &quot;Macy&#x27;s East&quot; organization based in New York, renaming the Abraham &amp; Straus stores in metropolitan New York with the Macy&#x27;s nameplate in 1995, and then erasing the Jordan Marsh moniker in New England in early 1996.

Federated followed that by leading a bid in mid-1995 to acquire the bankrupt Woodward &amp; Lothrop/John Wanamaker organization in the mid-Atlantic region, a bid it lost to a rival group led by long-time rival and future acquisition target The May Department Stores Company. Instead Federated soon agreed to purchase Broadway Stores, Inc. (owner of The Broadway, Emporium and Weinstock&#x27;s stores in California, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico), from its majority shareholder, Sam Zell, thereby gaining a leading position in Southern California and a dominant one in the Northern California marketplace. In early 1996 Federated dissolved Broadway Stores, incorporating the majority of its locations into Macy&#x27;s West, rebadging them as Macy&#x27;s and using the opportunity to retire the Bullock&#x27;s name. Several of the redundant Broadway locations were used to establish Bloomingdale&#x27;s on the West Coast, while many others were sold to Sears.

In 2000 Macy&#x27;s opened its doors in Puerto Rico, the chain&#x27;s first location in a U.S. territory. It is located in the Plaza Las Américas mall in San Juan.

In 2001 Federated dissolved its Stern&#x27;s division in the New York metropolitan area, with the bulk of the stores being absorbed into Macy&#x27;s East. Additionally, in July 2001, it acquired the Liberty House chain with department and specialty stores in Hawaii and Guam, consolidating it with Macy&#x27;s West.

In early 2003 Federated closed the majority of its historic Davison&#x27;s franchise in Atlanta (operating as Macy&#x27;s since 1985), rebranding its other Atlanta division Rich&#x27;s with the unwieldy name, Rich&#x27;s–Macy&#x27;s. The downtown location – formerly the Davison&#x27;s flagship store at 180 Peachtree Street – was shuttered at this time as well. The original Macy&#x27;s Lenox Square and Perimeter Mall locations were extensively remodeled and opened in October 2003 as the first Bloomingdale&#x27;s stores in Atlanta. The company rapidly followed suit in May 2003 with similar rebranding announcements for its other nameplates, Burdines in Florida, Goldsmith&#x27;s in Memphis, Lazarus in the lower Midwest, and The Bon Marché in the Pacific Northwest.

On March 6, 2005, the Bon-Macy&#x27;s, Burdines-Macy&#x27;s, Goldsmith&#x27;s-Macy&#x27;s, Lazarus-Macy&#x27;s, and Rich&#x27;s–Macy&#x27;s stores were renamed as simply &quot;Macy&#x27;s&quot;, the first two as the new Macy&#x27;s West and Macy&#x27;s Florida divisions respectively and the later three as part of the Macy&#x27;s Central division. As of July 2005, Macy&#x27;s had 424 stores throughout the U.S.

===2005–2006: Effects of Federated–May merger===
On February 28, 2005, Federated agreed to terms of a deal to acquire The May Department Stores Company for $11 billion (equivalent to $ in 2025) in stock, creating a department store chain with $30 billion (equivalent to $ in 2025) in annual sales and more than 1,000 stores.

On July 28, 2005, Federated announced, based on the success of converting its own regional brands to the Macy&#x27;s name, its plans to similarly convert 330 regional department stores owned by the May Company to the Macy&#x27;s nameplate. This included Kaufmann&#x27;s, Famous-Barr, Filene&#x27;s, Foley&#x27;s, Hecht&#x27;s, The Jones Store, L. S. Ayres, Meier &amp; Frank, Robinsons-May, and Strawbridge &amp; Clothier chains, pending approval of the merger by federal regulators. Though initially spared from the rebrandings announced in July, Marshall Field&#x27;s was added to the lot on September 20, 2005.

The rebranding of the May stores was disliked in Chicago and elsewhere because the stores were regarded as beloved local institutions. The renaming of Filene&#x27;s, Marshall Field&#x27;s, and Kaufmann&#x27;s, which were well known for their downtown flagship stores and local traditions provoked the most outrage. For example, Kaufmann&#x27;s operated the Kaufmann&#x27;s Celebrate the Season Parade which was traditionally broadcast live throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on television. Many customers publicly vowed to never again shop at the renamed May stores and to switch to competitors. Prominent film critic Roger Ebert voiced the grief of many Chicagoans at the loss of Field&#x27;s when he wrote in his column on September 21, 2005:

On January 12, 2006, Federated announced its plans to divest May Company&#x27;s Lord &amp; Taylor division. On June 22, 2006, Macy&#x27;s announced that NDRC Equity Partners, LLC would purchase Lord &amp; Taylor for US$1.2 billion (equivalent to $ in 2025), and completed the sale in October 2006.

By September 9, 2006, after renaming the former May Company stores, Macy&#x27;s operated approximately 850 stores in the United States. To promote its largest and most recent expansion, Macy&#x27;s used a version of the Martha and the Vandellas hit song, &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;, in its advertising. Also, the company took props from its annual Thanksgiving Day parade to various re-labeled stores throughout the nation, in what the company marketed as its &quot;Parade on Parade&quot;.

In October 2006, Federated Department Stores entered into an agreement with Zoom Systems to test more than 100 stores within retail giant Macy&#x27;s. Terry Lundgren, CEO of Federated, raved about the ability to provide consumers with a convenient means to purchase iPods and other consumer electronics, saying &quot;This is exciting because it brings most-wanted merchandise into stores in a unique new way... How cool is that?&quot; Today, Macy&#x27;s has converted its entire Electronics section in every store to (over 400) eSpot ZoomShops.

==Current operations under Macy&#x27;s, Inc.==
===2007–2014===

Macy&#x27;s significantly increased its use of television advertising and product placement in 2006 and 2007, using branding spots that featured the new Macy&#x27;s star logo. Macy&#x27;s television commercials are produced primarily by New York Production Services, a New York-based commercial and independent film production company. During two episodes of the popular ABC television series &quot;Desperate Housewives &quot;(&quot;I Remember That&quot; and &quot;Now You Know&quot;), a Macy&#x27;s location in the fictional city of Fairview was featured, rare instances of product placement promoting a department store chain in a scripted series. Nearly two years prior to the first episode, one of the first national commercials for Macy&#x27;s had aired during &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, shortly after the conversions of Rich&#x27;s, Lazarus, Goldsmith&#x27;s, The Bon Marché and Burdines.

On February 27, 2007, Federated Department Stores announced plans to change its corporate name to Macy&#x27;s Group, Inc. By March 28, the company further announced plans to convert its stock ticker symbol from &quot;FD&quot; to &quot;M&quot;, and revised its name change to Macy&#x27;s, Inc. The change in corporate names was approved by shareholders on May 18, 2007, and took effect on June 1, 2007. The company continues to operate stores under the Macy&#x27;s and Bloomingdale&#x27;s nameplates.

In March 2009, Macy&#x27;s opened a one-level, concept store in Gilbert, Arizona, a Phoenix suburb, that was designed to better fit open air lifestyle malls. Additional stores with the new format have opened in Fairview, Texas; Lee&#x27;s Summit, Missouri; and Nampa, Idaho. The stores are designed to be compact and meet current demands for more convenient shopping similar to Kohl&#x27;s and newer J. C. Penney stores. Lifestyle stores feature Starbucks Coffee Cafés with wireless web and fitting rooms designed to feel like lounges with sofas and Plasma TVs. Ceilings in the center areas are higher to be reminiscent of older department stores. The format was the culmination of 18 months of research to create stores for the &quot;My Macy&#x27;s&quot; initiative that allows stores to be merchandised differently in markets across the country to meet local demands.

On October 28, 2014 Macy&#x27;s, Inc. announced an extension of the lease-operation agreement with Al Tayer Group LLC that would bring the first Macy&#x27;s store overseas to Abu Dhabi, anchoring a new mall with its corporate-sister Bloomingdale&#x27;s, which will open its second overseas store (the first was located at the Dubai Mall); both are slated to open in 2018. Macy&#x27;s was the 15th-largest retailer in the United States for 2014 by revenue.

===2015–present===

In January 2015, it was announced that Macy&#x27;s would close 14 stores nationwide and shift 830 workers from Macy&#x27;s and Bloomingdale&#x27;s stores. Unrelated to the store closings, on July 13, 2015, Macy&#x27;s announced it had sold the former flagship store of Kaufmann&#x27;s in Downtown Pittsburgh for redevelopment, closing the location after 128 years.

In May 2015, Macy&#x27;s joined the new American Express-backed Plenti rewards card, which it shares with AT&amp;T Mobility, Direct Energy, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, ExxonMobil, Hulu, Nationwide Insurance, and Rite Aid.

On September 9, 2015, Macy&#x27;s announced it would close 35 to 40 under-performing stores by early 2016. The retailer&#x27;s struggles continued into the holiday season in 2015. The company announced that it experienced same store sales declines of 5.2% in November and December 2015 – typically busy months. In January 2016, Macy&#x27;s announced that it will layoff up to 4,800 employees. The company said that these closings would experience cost savings of $400 million. As of January 2016, Macy&#x27;s had 770 stores in total.

On August 11, 2016, Macy&#x27;s announced that it would close 100 stores in early 2017, expecting to save $550 million a year and cut more than 10,000 jobs. Macy&#x27;s claimed it would instead invest $250 million in digital business and growth strategies for the remaining stores. By January 2018, Macy&#x27;s had revealed the locations of 81 of the 100 store closures.

In September 2016, Macy&#x27;s announced that it would be opening an Apple Store in its flagship location, making it the first department store to host an Apple store. The announcement came after six straight quarters of sales drops and significant store closings. In early January 2017, the value of Macy&#x27;s shares fell 14%, its biggest drop in seven months.
In February 2017, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company made an overture to Macy&#x27;s for a potential takeover of the struggling department store.

Macy&#x27;s acquired experiential concept Story in May 2018 and made a minority investment in b8ta, a retail as a service concept, in June 2018.

By February 2019, Macy&#x27;s Inc. was operating 867 stores, including Macy&#x27;s, Backstage, Bloomingdale&#x27;s, Bloomingdale&#x27;s Outlets, Bluemercury, and STORY; 641 of the 867 stores were Macy&#x27;s, including 584 that are full line and 57 that are home, furniture, clearance and specialty stores.

In November 2018, Macy&#x27;s announced they would test smaller &quot;neighborhood&quot; stores to reduce costs and promote innovation within the customer experience realm.
As of 2018, Macy&#x27;s ranked 120 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue. Former CEO Jeff Gennette also launched an overhaul of Macy&#x27;s stores called the Growth150 strategic plan.

In the second quarter of 2019, Macy&#x27;s shares fell more than 13 percent. On August 14, shares hit $15.82, which was their lowest since February 2010.

After conducting two years of research, Macy&#x27;s announced in 2019 that it intended to ban the sale of fur products at its stores by the end of the 2020 fiscal year. The news follows the state of California&#x27;s ban on the manufacturing and sale of such items.

In 2020, Macy&#x27;s closed its Cincinnati headquarters, consolidating headquarters operations in New York City. JANA Partners, an activist investment firm, disclosed a large stake in Macy&#x27;s in 2021, and sent a letter to the board recommending spinning off the company&#x27;s online business. In response, Macy&#x27;s hired AlixPartners to review their business structure. By the end of 2021, JANA had reduced their holding in Macy&#x27;s by 84%, or about 1.5% of the company.

In August 2021, Macy&#x27;s announced they were partnering with Toys &quot;R&quot; Us to open toy shops in Macy&#x27;s stores, starting in 2022. In November 2021, Macy&#x27;s announced they were starting a free education program and boosting its corporation base salary to $15 per hour.

In February 2023, Macy&#x27;s said they would no longer sell leather goods made of exotic skins, such as reptiles or ostriches.

On the morning of December 4, 2023, a stabbing occurred at Macy&#x27;s Flagship store in Philadelphia, killing 27-year-old security guard Eric Harrison.

In January 2024, Macy&#x27;s rejected a $5 billion takeover from Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the company.

In January 2024, Sycamore Partners requested to purchase the struggling Macy&#x27;s company.

In February 2024, Macy&#x27;s announced that up to 150 underperforming stores would close by the end of 2026, with 50 stores closing by the end of 2024. That number was increased to 65 by December. Macy&#x27;s stated that the closing stores only represented 10% of its total sales. The company plans to focus on opening 45 Bloomingdale&#x27;s and 30 Bluemercury stores while remodeling 30 additional Bluemercury stores. 

In January 2025, 66 stores, including landmark locations in Philadelphia, Brooklyn and Manhattan, were set to close.

Some brands sold in Macy&#x27;s Backstage stores are not (or are no longer) sold by full-line Macy&#x27;s stores, such as Authentic Brands Group&#x27;s Izod and Arrow brands, and Ralph Lauren Corporation&#x27;s Chaps brand.

== Flagship stores ==
, Macy&#x27;s operates four flagship stores in four states. Many of the present-day Macy&#x27;s flagship stores were converted from the flagship stores of regional department stores that were acquired by Federated.


==Criticism and controversy==
Macy&#x27;s has had a long history with issues concerning discriminatory practices. In July 2003, then–New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer launched an investigation of the private policing system Macy&#x27;s has used to deal with suspected shoplifters. The investigation was prompted by a civil rights lawsuit and an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which reported on many of Macy&#x27;s tactics, including private jails and interrogations. Spitzer&#x27;s investigation found many of Macy&#x27;s actions, from ethnic profiling to handcuffing detainees, to be unlawful. In 2005, Macy&#x27;s settled the civil rights complaint for $600,000 (equivalent to $ in 2025), claiming to have put the illegal tactics to an end while maintaining the security system itself.

On June 6, 2006, Macy&#x27;s downtown Boston store (formerly the Jordan Marsh flagship) removed two mannequins and the Web address of the AIDS Action Committee from a window display promoting Boston&#x27;s annual gay pride celebration. The removal was apparently in response to pressure from MassResistance, a local group opposed to same-sex marriage, whose members complained the mannequins were &quot;homosexual&quot;. The removal of the mannequins was controversial and Boston mayor Thomas Menino was quoted as saying:

Macy&#x27;s responded by publishing an apology by the Macy&#x27;s East chairman, Ron Klein, in &quot;In Newsweekly&quot;, a Boston-area weekly with a large gay readership. Klein&#x27;s description of the incident as &quot;an internal breakdown in communication&quot;, further stated it was regrettable some would doubt Macy&#x27;s commitment to diversity as a result. The Web address was later restored – the mannequins, however, never made a reappearance.

In 2014, Macy&#x27;s paid $650,000 to settle claims that it racially profiled minority customers at its stores after initially refusing to admit any blame and instead placing it on the NYPD despite the profiling occurring at their store. 

In 2017, former Macy&#x27;s employees that alleged being wrongfully terminated by Macy&#x27;s sued Macy&#x27;s alleging that they were told to not sell products to customers appearing to be of Asian descent at its flagship Herald Square store. 

In 2018, Macy&#x27;s paid $75,000 to settle a disability discrimination lawsuit brought by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing an asthmatic employee rather than excusing a one day, health-related absence. 

In 2024, the company announced a delay to their third quarter earnings release and conference call citing an employee&#x27;s scheme to hide approximately $132-155mm of expenses, for no supposed reason.

<doc id="277876" wikidata="Q466749" url="?curid=277876" title="Stilton cheese">
<text>Stilton is an English cheese, produced in two varieties: blue, which has &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; added to generate a characteristic smell and taste, and white, which does not. Both have been granted the status of a protected designation of origin (PDO) by the European Commission, requiring that only such cheese produced in the three counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire may be called Stilton. The cheese takes its name from the village of Stilton, now in Cambridgeshire, where it has long been sold, but cannot be made because it is not in one of the three permitted counties.

==History==

Frances Pawlett (or Paulet), a cheesemaker of Wymondham, Leicestershire, has traditionally been credited with setting up the modern Stilton cheese shape and style in the 1720s, but others have also been named. Early 19th-century research published by William Marshall provides logic and oral history to indicate a continuum between the locally produced cheese of Stilton, and the later development of a high turnover commercial industry importing cheese produced elsewhere, under local guidance. A recipe for a Stilton cheese was published in 1726 by Richard Bradley, later first Professor of Botany at Cambridge University.

Another early printed reference to Stilton cheese came from William Stukeley in 1722. Daniel Defoe in his 1724 work &quot;A Tour thro&#x27; the Whole Island of Great Britain&quot; notes, &quot;We pass&#x27;d Stilton, a town famous for cheese, which is call&#x27;d our English Parmesan, and is brought to table with the mites or maggots round it, so thick, that they bring a spoon with them for you to eat the mites with, as you do the cheese.&quot;

According to the Stilton Cheesemaker&#x27;s Association, the first person to market Blue Stilton cheese was Cooper Thornhill, owner of the &quot;Bell Inn&quot; on the Great North Road, in the village of Stilton, Huntingdonshire, (now an administrative district of Cambridgeshire). Tradition has it that in 1730, Thornhill discovered a distinctive blue cheese while visiting a small farm near Melton Mowbray in rural Leicestershire – possibly Wymondham. He fell in love with the cheese and made a business arrangement that granted the &quot;Bell Inn&quot; exclusive marketing rights to Blue Stilton. Soon thereafter, wagonloads of cheese were being delivered there. The village stood on the Great North Road, a main stagecoach route between London and Northern England, so that Thornhill could promote sales and the fame of Stilton spread rapidly.

In 1936 the Stilton Cheesemakers&#x27; Association (SCMA) was formed to lobby for regulation to protect the quality and origin of the cheese. In 1966 Stilton was granted legal protection via a certification trade mark, the only British cheese to have received that status.

While Stilton was originally made from raw milk, production switched over to pasteurised milk after a health scare in the late 1980s. Since Stilton gained protected designation of origin status in 1996, cheese made from raw milk can no longer be sold under the Stilton name.

==Manufacture and PDO status==

Blue Stilton&#x27;s distinctive blue veins are created by piercing the crust of the cheese with stainless steel needles, allowing air into the core. The manufacturing and ripening process takes some nine to twelve weeks.

For cheese to use the name &quot;Stilton&quot;, it must be made in one of the three counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire and use pasteurised local milk. Manufacturers of Stilton in these counties received protection under European Law as a protected designation of origin (PDO) in 1996. The cheese remains protected by its PDO even after Brexit, under EU law (in the EU and Northern Ireland) and under UK law (England, Scotland and Wales).

By September 2016, just six dairies were licensed to make Stilton – three in Leicestershire, two in Nottinghamshire, and one in Derbyshire – each being subject to regular audit by an independent inspection agency accredited to European Standard EN 45011. Four of the licensed dairies are based in the Vale of Belvoir, which straddles the Nottinghamshire/Leicestershire/Lincolnshire borders. This area is commonly seen as the heartland of Stilton production, with dairies located in the town of Melton Mowbray and the villages of Colston Bassett, Cropwell Bishop, Long Clawson and Saxelbye. Another Leicestershire dairy was in the grounds of Quenby Hall near the village of Hungarton, outside the generally accepted boundaries of the Vale of Belvoir. Quenby Hall restarted Stilton production in a new dairy in August 2005 (the old dairy dated back to the 18th century) but the business folded in 2011.

Stilton cheese has been made in Derbyshire since 1900, originally at Hartington. The former Dairy Crest-owned licensed dairy that produced the product at Hartington was acquired by the Long Clawson dairy in 2008 and closed in 2009, with its production transferred to Leicestershire. Two former employees set up the Hartington Creamery at Pikehall in Hartington parish, which was licensed in 2014. Three additional partners soon joined them and this business is the smallest of the six companies licensed to make Stilton. As of March 2021, Hartington Stilton was marketing within the UK but also exporting to the US and to the EU; it had just started exporting to Canada. The company director told the BBC that they had &quot;a surge in interest and consumer sales from the US&quot; but it had to stop sales to the European Union following Brexit because of the cost of a veterinary surgeon certificate.

Stilton cheese cannot be made in Stilton village, which gave the cheese its name, because it is not in any of the three permitted counties, but rather in the administrative county of Cambridgeshire and the historic county of Huntingdonshire. The Original Cheese Company applied to Defra to amend the Stilton PDO to include the village, but the application was rejected in 2013.

Stilton cheese was also manufactured in Staffordshire. The Nuttall family of Beeby, Leicestershire opened a Stilton cheese factory in Uttoxeter in 1892 to take advantage of the local milk and good transport links. However, this firm did not last long and the site became a general dairy.

==Protected characteristics==

To be labelled as &quot;Blue Stilton&quot; in the EU, a cheese must:
*be made specifically in the counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire or Nottinghamshire,
*if possible, use exclusively locally produced and pasteurised milk,
*have the traditional cylindrical shape,
*form its own crust or coat,
*be unpressed,
*contain blue veins radiating from the centre,
*have a &quot;taste profile typical of Stilton&quot;,
*and have a minimum of 48% milk fat in the dry matter.

In the event of a local milk shortage, milk can instead be sourced from the surrounding counties of Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire, Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Greater Manchester, Cheshire, Yorkshire, or Lincolnshire.

On average, finished Stilton cheese has a typical fat content of 35% and protein content of 23%.

==Similar cheeses==

A number of blue cheeses are made in a similar way to Blue Stilton. These gain their blue veins and distinct flavour from the use of one or more saprotrophic fungi, such as &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; and &quot;Penicillium glaucum&quot;. Since the PDO came into effect, some British supermarkets have stocked a generic &quot;British Blue cheese&quot;. Other makers have adopted their own names and styles. Other typical British blue cheeses are Oxford Blue and Shropshire Blue. Stichelton is an English blue cheese virtually identical to Blue Stilton, but because it does not use pasteurised milk it cannot legally be called Stilton, due its PDO status.

Many countries have blue cheeses. Italy, for example, has greenish blue Gorgonzola made from cow&#x27;s milk. France has blue cheeses such as Fourme d&#x27;Ambert from Auvergne, made with cow&#x27;s milk, and Roquefort, made with ewe&#x27;s milk. Denmark produces Danish Blue Cheese. Some of the many cheeses in the Netherlands are blue, such as Ruscello.

==Consumption==

Blue Stilton is often eaten with celery or pears. It is commonly added as a flavouring to vegetable soup, notably to cream of celery or broccoli. It is otherwise eaten with various crackers, biscuits or bread. It can be used to make a blue cheese sauce to be served drizzled over a steak, or the cheese can be crumbled over a salad. Traditionally, a barley wine or port is paired with Blue Stilton, but it also goes well with sweet sherry or Madeira wine. The practice of scooping a hollow in the centre of a Stilton cheese and pouring port wine into it is deprecated; nonetheless this combination has been marketed in screw-topped tubes &quot;like toothpaste&quot;. The cheese is traditionally eaten at Christmas. The rind of the cheese forms naturally during the aging process and is edible, unlike the rind of some other cheeses, such as Edam.

White Stilton has not had the &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; mould introduced into it, which would otherwise lead to the blue veining normally associated with Stilton. It is a crumbly, creamy, open-textured cheese now extensively used as a base for blending with apricot, ginger and citrus or vine fruits to create dessert cheeses and has also been used as a flavouring for chocolate.

Huntsman cheese is made with both Blue Stilton and Double Gloucester.

==Cultural influence==
English author G. K. Chesterton wrote several essays on cheese, specifically on the absence of cheese in art. In one of these he recalls a time when he happened to visit a small town in the fenlands of England, which turned out to be Stilton. His experience in Stilton left a deep impression on him, which he expressed through poetry in his &quot;Sonnet to a Stilton Cheese&quot;:
This is in part a parody of William Wordsworth&#x27;s sonnet &quot;London, 1802&quot;, the opening line of which was &quot;Milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour.&quot;

George Orwell wrote an essay, &quot;In Defence of English Cooking&quot;, first published in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; on 15 December 1945. While enumerating the high points of British cuisine, he touches on Stilton: &quot;Then there are the English cheeses. There are not many of them, but I fancy that Stilton is the best cheese of its type in the world, with Wensleydale not far behind.&quot;

The Stilton Cheese Makers Association produced a fragrance called &quot;Eau de Stilton&quot;, which was &quot;very different to the very sweet perfumes you smell wafting down the street as someone walks past you.&quot;

The search for an unpasteurised Stilton cheese was a plot element of a &quot;Chef!&quot; episode titled &quot;The Big Cheese&quot;, aired on BBC1 on 25 February 1993.

A character named G. D&#x27;Arcy &quot;Stilton&quot; Cheesewright appears in several of the Jeeves novels of P. G. Wodehouse.

<text>The Bornean bristlehead (Pityriasis gymnocephala), also variously known as the bristled shrike, bald-headed crow or the bald-headed wood-shrike, is the only member of the passerine family Pityriasidae and genus Pityriasis. This enigmatic and vulnerable species is endemic to the southeast Asian island of Borneo, where it lives in small groups in the rainforest canopy.

== Taxonomy ==
The relationships of this species have been controversial. At times it has been placed in the Prionopidae, the Cracticidae, the Artamidae or the Corvidae. A more recent suggestion has been to include it in the Tephrodornithidae, a new family that includes &quot;Hemipus&quot; and &quot;Tephrodornis&quot;.

== Description ==

The Bornean bristlehead is a medium-sized bird, in length. It is mostly black, with bright red thighs, head, throat and neck, and grey ear-coverts. The featherless crown is deep yellow and covered in short, 3–4 mm long, bristle-like skin projections, giving it a bald appearance from afar. This gives the species its common name &quot;bristlehead&quot;, genus name &quot;Pityriasis&quot; (from Greek, &quot;having dandruff&quot;) and specific name &quot;gymnocephala&quot; (from Greek, &quot;bald-headed&quot;). Red flank patches are present in all females and some males, but can be covered by the wings when perched. There is a white wing-patch at the base of the primaries, visible in flight. It has a massive heavy black hooked bill and a short tail, giving it a chunky appearance.

Juveniles have entirely or mostly black thighs, a more orange-red head and neck, orange-red ear-coverts, some red mottling to the underparts, a few red feathers on the crown and undeveloped bristles.

It is a noisy species making a variety of unmusical calls, including distinctive high-pitched nasal whining notes interspersed with harsher notes, chattering noises, whistles, honks and chortles.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The bristlehead is endemic to the island of Borneo where it is widespread, but generally sparse and patchy in occurrence, although it can be locally common. It mainly lives in lowlands, but also occurs in hilly areas up to above mean sea level. It can be found in the canopy of both primary and secondary forests, including peat swamp forests, mixed dipterocarp forests and mangrove forests.

== Behaviour ==
The Bornean bristlehead is a sociable species which often moves steadily in small garrulous flocks of up to 10 birds in the mid and upper canopy of the forest, sometimes accompanied by other large or medium-sized forest birds such as malkohas, babblers, drongos, trogons, woodpeckers and hornbills in mixed-species feeding flocks. Its movements in the canopy are slow and heavy and it flies with a fast, shallow wing-beat.

=== Feeding ===
Bornean bristleheads feed primarily on animal prey, mainly large insects and other arthropods, but also small vertebrates like lizards and frogs. Prey is gleaned from foliage, twigs, branches and trunks at canopy to mid-levels of the forest. It occasionally take fruits.

=== Breeding ===
Breeding behaviour is largely unknown, though an oviduct egg was described as being white with grey and brown spots and with dimensions of 31 x 25 mm. A sighting of two apparent females feeding a fledgling has been interpreted as suggesting communal breeding. Birds have also been seen in flight carrying nesting material.

== Conservation ==
The Bornean bristlehead is considered vulnerable due to the rapid and ongoing deforestation in Borneo, along with burning of peat swamp forest. The principal habitat of the species is Borneo&#x27;s lowland forests, where an estimated 2.5% is lost each year (based on reviews covering 2015–2020). It occurs in a number of protected areas, but some of these are also targeted by illegal logging.
