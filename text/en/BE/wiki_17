<text>Capital punishment in the United Kingdom predates the formation of the UK, having been used in Britain and Ireland from ancient times until the second half of the 20th century. The last executions in the United Kingdom were by hanging, and took place in 1964; :capital punishment for murder was suspended in 1965 and finally abolished in 1969 (1973 in Northern Ireland). Although unused, the death penalty remained a legally defined punishment for certain offences such as treason until it was completely abolished in 1998; the last person to be executed for treason was William Joyce, in 1946. In 2004, Protocol No. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights became binding on the United Kingdom; it prohibits the restoration of the death penalty as long as the UK is a party to the convention (regardless of the UK&#x27;s status in relation to the European Union).

==Background==
During the reign of Henry VIII, as many as 72,000 people are estimated to have been executed. In Elizabethan England, the death penalty applied for treason, murder, manslaughter, infanticide, rape, arson, grand larceny (theft of goods worth more than a shilling), highway robbery, buggery, sodomy and heresy. Hanging was the method used for all but treason, which was punished by drawing, hanging and quartering for men, burning for women, and beheading for the nobility; and heresy, which was punished by burning. About 24% of those facing trial for such offences were actually executed. About 75% of hangings were for theft.

Sir Samuel Romilly, speaking to the House of Commons on capital punishment in 1810, declared that &quot;[there is] no country on the face of the earth in which there [have] been so many different offences according to law to be punished with death as in England&quot;. Known as the &quot;Bloody Code&quot;, at its height the criminal law included some 220 crimes punishable by death, including &quot;being in the company of Gypsies for one month&quot;, &quot;strong evidence of malice in a child aged 7–14 years of age&quot; and &quot;blacking the face or using a disguise whilst committing a crime&quot;. Many of these offences had been introduced by the Whig oligarchy to protect the property of the wealthy classes that emerged during the first half of the 18th century, a notable example being the Black Act 1723, which created 50 capital offences for various acts of theft and poaching. Crimes eligible for the death penalty included shoplifting and stealing sheep, cattle, and horses, and before abolition of the death penalty for theft in 1832, &quot;English law was notorious for prescribing the death penalty for a vast range of offences as slight as the theft of goods valued at twelve pence.&quot;

Whilst executions for murder, burglary and robbery were common, the death sentences for minor offenders were often not carried out. A sentence of death could be commuted or respited (permanently postponed) for reasons such as benefit of clergy, official pardons, pregnancy of the offender or performance of military or naval duty. Between 1770 and 1830, an estimated 35,000 death sentences were handed down in England and Wales, of which 7,000 executions were carried out.

==Reform==

In 1808, Romilly had the death penalty removed for pickpockets and lesser offenders, starting a process of reform that continued over the next 50 years. The death penalty was mandatory (although it was frequently commuted by the government) until the Judgement of Death Act 1823 gave judges the official power to commute the death penalty except for treason and murder. The Punishment of Death, etc. Act 1832 reduced the number of capital crimes by two-thirds. In 1832, the death penalty was abolished for theft, counterfeiting, and forgery except for the forgery of wills and certain powers of attorney.

Gibbeting was abolished in 1832 and hanging in chains was abolished in 1834. In 1837, the death penalty for forging wills and powers of attorney was abolished. The death penalty for rape and some other offences was abolished by the Substitution of Punishments of Death Act in 1841. In 1861, several acts of Parliament (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. 94 to c. 100) further reduced the number of civilian capital crimes in England and Wales to five: murder, treason, espionage, arson in royal dockyards, and piracy with violence; there were other offences under military law. The 1866 report of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment noted further obsolete capital offences in Scots law which had not yet been formally repealed. The death penalty remained mandatory for treason and murder unless commuted by the monarch.

The 1866 royal commissioners concluded (with dissenters) that there was not a case for abolition but recommended an end to public executions. This proposal was included in the Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868. From that date executions in Great Britain were carried out only in prisons. The punishment of beheading and quartering those executed for treason was abolished in 1870. The last application of that punishment had been in 1820 and the last sentence to the punishment had been in 1839.

The Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1887 abolished the death penalty in Scots law for crimes other than murder, &quot;treason or rebellion against the Sovereign&quot;, and (in theory but not in practice) certain types of attempted murder. 
Relevant offences, which were obsolete or for which lesser punishments had long applied in practice, included 
theft &quot;furtum grave&quot;;
robbery or stouthrief;
piracy;
breaking into houses or ships;
destroying ships;
fire raising;
certain classes of malicious mischief;
beating and cursing parents;
hamesucken;
aggravated rape;
abduction;
returning to Scotland after banishment for performing a marriage without banns;
incest;
sodomy;
and
bestiality.

===20th century===
In 1908, the Children Act 1908 banned the execution of juveniles under the age of 16. In 1922 a new offence of infanticide was introduced to replace the charge of murder for mothers killing their children in the first year of life. In 1930 a parliamentary select committee recommended that capital punishment be suspended for a trial period of five years, but no action was taken. From 1931 pregnant women could no longer be hanged (following the birth of their child) although in practice since the 18th century their sentences had always been commuted.

In 1933 the minimum age for capital punishment was raised to 18 under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. The last known execution by the civilian courts of a person under 18 was that of Charles Dobell, 17, hanged at Maidstone together with his accomplice William Gower, 18, in January 1889. Harold Wilkins, at 16 years old, was the last juvenile sentenced to the death penalty in the United Kingdom, in 1932 for a sexually related murder, but he was reprieved due to age.

In 1938 the issue of the abolition of capital punishment was brought before parliament. A clause within the Criminal Justice Bill called for an experimental five-year suspension of the death penalty. When war broke out in 1939 the bill was postponed. It was revived after the war in 1948 and to much surprise was adopted by a majority in the House of Commons (245 to 222). In the House of Lords the abolition clause was defeated but the remainder of the bill was passed as the Criminal Justice Act 1948. Popular support for abolition was absent and the government decided that it would be inappropriate for it to assert its supremacy by invoking the Parliament Act 1911 over such an unpopular issue.

====Postwar====
The then Home Secretary, James Chuter Ede, instead set up a new royal commission (the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, 1949–1953) with instructions to determine &quot;whether the liability to suffer capital punishment should be limited or modified&quot;. The commission&#x27;s report discussed a number of alternatives to execution by hanging (including the electric chair, gas inhalation, lethal injection, shooting, and the guillotine), but rejected them. It had more difficulty with the principle of capital punishment. Popular opinion believed that the death penalty acted as a deterrent to criminals, but the statistics within the report were inconclusive. Whilst the report recommended abolition from an ethical standpoint, it made no mention of possible miscarriages of justice.

The public had by then expressed great dissatisfaction with the verdict in the case of Timothy Evans, who was tried and hanged in 1950 for murdering his infant daughter. It later transpired in 1953 that John Christie had strangled at least six women in the same house; he also confessed to killing Timothy&#x27;s wife. If the jury in Evans&#x27;s trial had known this, Evans might have been acquitted. There were other cases in the same period where doubts arose over convictions and subsequent hangings, such as the notorious case of Derek Bentley.

The commission concluded that unless there was overwhelming public support in favour of abolition, the death penalty should be retained.

Between 1900 and 1949, 621 men and 11 women were executed in England and Wales. Ten German agents were executed during the First World War under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, and 16 spies were executed during the Second World War under the Treachery Act 1940.

Whereas the 1866 Naval Discipline Act made &quot;All Spies for the Enemy&quot; subject to death, the Naval Discipline Act 1957 only made spying capital for non-naval personnel if it occurred on naval ships or bases. (The Official Secrets Act 1911 had created a separate non-capital spying offence.)

By 1957 a number of controversial cases highlighted the issue of capital punishment again. Campaigners for abolition were partially rewarded with the Homicide Act 1957. The Act brought in a distinction between capital and non-capital murder.

=====Homicide Act 1957 offences punishable by death=====
Only six categories of murder were now punishable by execution:
* in the course or furtherance of theft
* by shooting or causing an explosion
* while resisting arrest or during an escape
* of a police officer
* of a prison officer by a prisoner
* the second of two murders committed on different occasions (if both done in Great Britain).

The police and the government were of the opinion that the death penalty deterred offenders from carrying firearms and it was for this reason that such offences remained punishable by death.

====Free votes====
The 1957 act was the last time a three-line whip was imposed in Parliament on the death penalty. Apart from the 1948 Commons decision to accede to the Lords&#x27; amendment, all other votes from the 1939 suspension bill to the 1994 reintroduction motion have been free votes with the issue regarded as a matter of conscience. These have been instigated by a backbencher (by motion or private member&#x27;s bill) rather than on behalf of the Government or the official Opposition. Some commentators see this conscience treatment as a way for political parties to insulate themselves from a backlash over an issue on which their leadership&#x27;s support for abolition differed from public support for the death penalty.

==Abolition==

In 1965 the Labour MP Sydney Silverman, who had committed himself to the cause of abolition for longer than 20 years, introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Bill to suspend the death penalty for murder. It was passed on a free vote in the House of Commons by 200 votes to 98. The bill was subsequently passed by the House of Lords by 204 votes to 104. Silverman was opposed in the General Election 1966 in the Nelson and Colne constituency by Patrick Downey, the uncle of Lesley Anne Downey, a victim in the Moors murders case, who stood on an explicitly pro-hanging platform. Downey polled over 5,000 votes, 13.7%, then the largest vote for a genuinely independent candidate since 1945.

The Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 suspended the death penalty in Great Britain (but not in Northern Ireland) for murder for a period of five years, and substituted a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment; it further provided that if, before the expiry of the five-year suspension, each House of Parliament passed a resolution to make the effect of the Act permanent, then it would become permanent. In 1969 the Home Secretary, James Callaghan, proposed a motion to make the Act permanent, which was carried in the Commons on 16 December 1969, and a similar motion was carried in the Lords on 18 December. The death penalty for murder was abolished in Northern Ireland on 25 July 1973 under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973.

Following the abolition of the death penalty for murder, the House of Commons held a vote during each subsequent parliament until 1997 to restore the death penalty. This motion was always defeated, but the death penalty remained for other crimes until the dates mentioned below:

# causing a fire or explosion in a naval dockyard, ship, magazine or warehouse (until the Criminal Damage Act 1971);
# spying in ships of the Royal Navy, or its establishments abroad (until the Armed Forces Act 1981);
# piracy with violence (until the Crime and Disorder Act 1998);
# treason (until the Crime and Disorder Act 1998);
# certain purely military offences under the jurisdiction of the armed forces. The last applicable offences (until the Human Rights Act 1998) were:
## serious misconduct in action;
## assisting the enemy;
## obstructing operations;
## giving false air signals;
## mutiny or incitement to mutiny; and
## failure to suppress a mutiny with intent to assist the enemy.

However, no executions were carried out in the United Kingdom for any of these offences after the abolition of the death penalty for murder.

Nevertheless, there remained a working gallows at HMP Wandsworth, London, until 1994, which was tested every six months until 1992. This gallows is now housed in the National Justice Museum in Nottingham.

===Last executions===
England and in the United Kingdom: on 13 August 1964, Peter Anthony Allen, at Walton Prison in Liverpool, and Gwynne Owen Evans, at Strangeways Prison in Manchester, were executed for the murder of John Alan West on 7 April that year.

In 1955 Ruth Ellis was the last woman to be hanged in Britain; for the murder of her lover David Blakely.

Scotland: Henry John Burnett, 21, on 15 August 1963 in Craiginches Prison, Aberdeen, for the murder of seaman Thomas Guyan.

Northern Ireland: Robert McGladdery, 26, on 20 December 1961 in Crumlin Road Gaol, Belfast, for the murder of Pearl Gamble.

Wales: Vivian Teed, 24, in HMP Swansea on 6 May 1958, for the murder of William Williams, sub-postmaster of Fforestfach Post Office.

===Last death sentences===
Northern Ireland: Liam Holden in 1973 in Northern Ireland, for the capital murder of a British soldier during the Troubles. Holden was removed from the death cell in May 1973. In 2012 his conviction was quashed on appeal on the grounds that his confession was obtained by torture.

England: David Chapman, who was sentenced to hang in November 1965 for the murder of a swimming pool nightwatchman in Scarborough. He was released from prison in 1979 and later died in a car accident.

Scotland: Patrick McCarron in 1964 for shooting his wife. He killed himself in prison in 1970.

Wales: Edgar Black, who was reprieved on 6 November 1963. He had shot his wife&#x27;s lover in Cardiff.

=== Final abolition ===
The Criminal Damage Act 1971 abolished the offence of arson in royal dockyards.

The Armed Forces Act 1981 abolished the death penalty for the civilian offence of spying in navy ships or bases which had been created by the Naval Discipline Act 1957.

Beheading was abolished as a method of execution for treason in 1973. Hanging, however, remained available until 30 September 1998 when, under a House of Lords amendment to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, proposed by Lord Archer of Sandwell, the death penalty was abolished for treason and piracy with violence, replacing it with a discretionary maximum sentence of life imprisonment. These were the last civilian offences punishable by death.

On 20 May 1998 the House of Commons voted to ratify the 6th Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibiting capital punishment except &quot;in time of war or imminent threat of war&quot;. The last remaining provisions for the death penalty under military jurisdiction (including in wartime) were removed when section 21(5) of the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force on 9 November 1998. On 10 October 2003, effective from 1 February 2004, the UK acceded to the 13th Protocol, which prohibits the death penalty in all circumstances.

As a legacy from colonial times, several states in the West Indies still had the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as the court of final appeal; although the death penalty has been retained in these states, the Privy Council would sometimes delay or deny executions. Some of these states severed links with the British court system in 2001 by transferring the responsibilities of the Privy Council to the Caribbean Court of Justice, to speed up executions.

===Crown dependencies===

Although not part of the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey are British Crown dependencies.

In the Channel Islands, the last death sentence was passed in 1984; the last execution in the Channel Islands was in Jersey on 9 October 1959, when Francis Joseph Huchet was hanged for murder. The Human Rights (Amendment) (Jersey) Order 2006 amends the Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000 to give effect to the 13th Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights providing for the total abolition of the death penalty. Both of these laws came into effect on 10 December 2006. Capital punishment was abolished in Guernsey in 2003, and the 13th Protocol was extended to Guernsey in April 2004. Sark (which is part of Guernsey but has its own laws) formally retained it until January 2004, when the Chief Pleas in a 14–9 vote removed it from the statutes.

The last execution on the Isle of Man took place in 1872, when John Kewish was hanged for patricide. Capital punishment was not formally abolished by Tynwald (the island&#x27;s parliament) until 1993. Five persons were sentenced to death (for murder) on the Isle of Man between 1973 and 1992, although all sentences were commuted to life imprisonment. The last person to be sentenced to death in the UK or its dependencies was Anthony Teare, who was convicted at the Manx Court of General Gaol Delivery in Douglas for contract murder in 1992; he was subsequently retried and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1994. In 2004 the 13th Protocol was adopted, with an effective date of 1 November 2006.

===Overseas territories===
Like the Crown dependencies, the British overseas territories are constitutionally not part of the United Kingdom. However, the British government&#x27;s ultimate responsibility for good governance of the territories has led it over recent years to pursue a policy of revoking all statutory provision for the death penalty in those territories where it had up until recently been legal.

The last executions in an overseas territory, and indeed the last on British soil, took place in Bermuda in 1977, when two men, Larry Tacklyn and Erskine Burrows, were hanged for the 1973 murder of the territory&#x27;s then governor, Sir Richard Sharples. In a 1990 referendum with a 33% turnout, 79% of Bermudian voters opted to retain the death penalty.

In 1991, the British government passed an Order in Council, the Caribbean Territories (Abolition of Death Penalty for Murder) Order 1991, which abolished capital punishment for murder in Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat and the Turks and Caicos Islands.

The British government was unable to extend the abolition via Order in Council to Bermuda, the UK&#x27;s most autonomous overseas territory with powers of almost total self-governance—but warned that if voluntary abolition was not forthcoming it would be forced to consider the unprecedented step of &quot;whether to impose abolition by means of an Act of Parliament&quot;. As a result, the Bermudian government introduced its own domestic legislation in 1999 to rectify the problem.

Further measures were subsequently adopted to revoke technicalities in British overseas territories&#x27; domestic legislation as regards use of the death penalty for crimes of treason and piracy. In October 2002 the British government abolished the death penalty for treason and piracy in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Since then, the death penalty has been outlawed under all circumstances in all the UK&#x27;s overseas territories.

==Policy regarding foreign capital punishment==
Under section 94 of the Extradition Act 2003, it is unlawful for an extradition of an individual to take place if the individual is accused of a capital crime, unless the Home Secretary has received assurances that the death penalty would not be applied in that case. Regardless of this, in July 2018, the Government said it would not object to the United States seeking the death penalty for two suspected British members of the Islamic State captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces. Although not strictly an extradition case, in response to an urgent question in Parliament on the matter, the Government stated that they still held the policy &quot;to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle&quot;.

==Public support for reintroduction of capital punishment==
Since the death penalty&#x27;s suspension in 1965, there have been continued public and media calls for its reintroduction, particularly prompted by high-profile murder cases.

At the same time, there have been a number of miscarriages of justice since 1965 where persons convicted of murder have later had their convictions quashed on appeal and been released from prison, strengthening the argument of those who oppose the death penalty&#x27;s reintroduction. These include the Birmingham Six (cleared in 1991 of planting an IRA bomb which killed 21 people in 1974), the Guildford Four (cleared in 1989 of murdering five people in another 1974 IRA bombing), Stephen Downing (a Derbyshire man who was freed in 2001 after serving 27 years for the murder of a woman in a churchyard) and Barry George (who was freed in 2007 when his conviction for the 1999 murder of TV presenter Jill Dando was quashed on appeal).

Perhaps the first high-profile murder case which sparked widespread calls for a return of the death penalty was the Moors murders trial in 1966, the year after the death penalty&#x27;s suspension, in which Ian Brady and Myra Hindley were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders of two children and a teenager in the Manchester area (they later confessed to a further two murders). Later in 1966, the murder of three policemen in West London also attracted widespread public support for the death penalty&#x27;s return. Other subsequent high-profile cases to have sparked widespread media and public calls for the death penalty&#x27;s return include &quot;Yorkshire Ripper&quot; Peter Sutcliffe, convicted in 1981 of murdering 13 women and attacking seven others in the north of England; Roy Whiting, who murdered a seven-year-old girl in West Sussex in 2000; and Ian Huntley, a Cambridgeshire school caretaker who killed two 10-year-old girls in 2002.

A November 2009 television survey showed that 70% favoured reinstating the death penalty for at least one of the following crimes: armed robbery, rape, crimes related to paedophilia, terrorism, adult murder, child murder, child rape, treason, child abuse or kidnapping. However, respondents only favoured capital punishment for adult murder, the polling question asked by other organisations such as Gallup, by small majorities or pluralities: overall, 51% favoured the death penalty for adult murder, while 56% in Wales did, 55% in Scotland, and only 49% in England.

In August 2011, the Internet blogger Paul Staines—who writes the political blog &quot;Guido Fawkes&quot; and heads the Restore Justice Campaign—launched an e-petition on the Downing Street website calling for the restoration of the death penalty for those convicted of the murder of children and police officers. The petition was one of several in support or opposition of capital punishment to be published by the government with the launch of its e-petitions website. Petitions attracting 100,000 signatures would prompt a parliamentary debate on a particular topic, but not necessarily lead to any Parliamentary Bills being put forward. When the petition closed on 4 February 2012 it had received 26,351 signatures in support of restoring capital punishment, but a counter-petition calling to retain the ban on capital punishment received 33,455 signatures during the same time period.

Also in August 2011, a representative survey conducted by Angus Reid Public Opinion showed that 65% of Britons support reinstating the death penalty for murder in Great Britain, while 28% oppose this course of action. Men and respondents aged over 35 are more likely to endorse the change.

In March 2015 a survey by the NatCen British Social Attitudes Report showed that public support for the death penalty had dropped to 48%.

In April 2021 a poll found that 54% of Britons said they would support reinstating the death penalty for those convicted of terrorism in the UK. About a quarter (23%) of respondents said they would be opposed.

===Parliamentary debates on reintroduction===
After Royal Assent for the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965, supporters in Parliament have made several attempts to reintroduce capital punishment. On 23 November 1966, Duncan Sandys was refused leave to bring in a Bill to restore capital punishment for the murder of police or prison officers, by a vote of 170 to 292. Motions to make the five-year suspension of capital punishment under the 1965 Act permanent were opposed, but agreed by 343 to 185 in the House of Commons; in the House of Lords, an amendment to continue with a temporary suspension of capital punishment until 31 July 1973 was rejected by 174 to 220. In April 1973, the House of Commons voted against reintroduction.

The deaths of civilians in several IRA bombings in 1974 prompted a renewed debate. On 11 December 1974 Brian Walden moved a motion declaring that &quot;the death penalty would neither deter terrorists nor increase the safety of the public&quot;; Jill Knight moved an amendment calling instead for introduction of legislation providing for death to be the penalty for acts of terrorism causing death. Her amendment was rejected by 217 to 369. A year later, Ivan Lawrence&#x27;s motion &quot;That this House demands capital punishment for terrorist offences causing death&quot; was rejected by 232 to 361.
After the Conservatives&#x27; victory in the 1979 general election, Eldon Griffiths (Parliamentary adviser to the Police Federation of England and Wales) moved a motion &quot;that the sentence of capital punishment should again be available to the courts&quot; on 19 July 1979. While the motion was not expected to pass, the margin of its defeat (243 to 362) was much wider than expected. Later in the same Parliament, the Criminal Justice Bill provided an opportunity on 11 May 1982 for several new clauses to be proposed which would have reinstated capital punishment. The first, which simply declared that &quot;A person convicted of murder shall be liable to capital punishment&quot;, was tabled by Edward Gardner, and rejected by 195 to 357. It was followed by an alternative under which capital punishment would be available &quot;as the penalty for an act of terrorism involving the loss of human life&quot;; this new clause was rejected by 176 to 332. A further new clause proposing capital punishment &quot;as the penalty for murder by means of firearms or explosives&quot; was rejected by 176 to 343. Then a new clause allowing for capital punishment &quot;as the penalty for murder of a police or prison officer&quot; was rejected by 208 to 332. Finally, a new clause allowing capital punishment &quot;as the penalty for murder in the course of robbery and burglary which involves the use of offensive weapons&quot; was rejected by 151 to 331.

The new Parliament in 1983 again prompted supporters of capital punishment to put their case. Sir Edward Gardner&#x27;s motion &quot;That this House favours the restoration of the death penalty for murder&quot; was debated on 13 July 1983, with several amendments moved to restrict capital punishment to certain categories of murder. The amendments were voted on first: capital punishment for murder &quot;resulting from acts of terrorism&quot; was rejected by 245 to 361, for murder &quot;of a police officer during the course of his duties&quot; by 263 to 344, for murder &quot;of a prison officer during the course of his duties&quot; by 252 to 348, for murder &quot;by shooting or causing an explosion&quot; by 204 to 374, and for murder &quot;in the course or furtherance of theft&quot; by 194 to 369. The main motion was then defeated by 223 to 368. Towards the end of the Parliament, a new clause proposed to the Criminal Justice Bill proposed to return the death penalty for &quot;A person convicted by the unanimous verdict of a jury of the premeditated killing of another person or of knowingly and intentionally killing another person in a manner, or for a reason, or in circumstances which a reasonable person would consider to be evil&quot; was rejected by 230 to 342 on 1 April 1987.

The Criminal Justice Bill in 1988 provided a further opportunity for a debate; the new clause proposed by Roger Gale allowed for the jury in a murder case to &quot;have the power, upon reaching a verdict of guilt of murder, to recommend ... death in the manner authorised by law&quot;. It was rejected by 218 to 341.

The aforementioned bills were rejected despite support from then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

On 17 December 1990 a new Criminal Justice Bill again saw amendments designed to reintroduce capital punishment. The first covered anyone over 18 &quot;convicted of the murder of a police officer acting in the execution of his duty&quot; and was rejected by 215 to 350; a general reintroduction of death as the penalty for murder (with special provision for the Court of Appeal to decide whether to substitute a life sentence) was then rejected by 182 to 367. Capital punishment for &quot;murder committed by means of firearms, explosives or an offensive weapon, or for the murder of a police or prison officer&quot; was rejected by 186 to 349.

A Parliamentary debate on a question proposing reintroduction of capital punishment came on 21 February 1994 when new clauses to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill were moved. The first, providing for death as the sentence for &quot;the murder of a police officer acting in the execution of his duty&quot;, was rejected by 186 to 383; A new clause providing for general reintroduction with power for the Court of Appeal to substitute life imprisonment was rejected by 159 to 403. This would have been aimed at terrorists in the Northern Ireland conflict.

In June 2013 a new bill for capital punishment in England and Wales was introduced, sponsored by Conservative MP Philip Hollobone. This Bill was withdrawn.
===Parties in support===
The British Democrats, Britain First and UK Independence Party (UKIP) have policies for a referendum on the reintroduction of the death penalty in the UK.

<text>The Zygophyllales are an order of dicotyledonous plants, comprising the following two families:

* Family Zygophyllaceae
* Family Krameriaceae

According to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG II) both families are unplaced to order, but nevertheless included in the Eurosids I. The APG III system of 2009, however, recognized this order. Even if the monogeneric family Krameriaceae shares few common traits with the family Zygophyllaceae, researchers see little advantage in keeping it as a separate family (e.g. Sheahan and Chase). The name Zygophyllales can be used if one finds it appropriate to place both families into an order. The order remains unchanged in the APG IV system.

Under the Cronquist system, the Zygophyllaceae were included within the Sapindales, and the Krameriaceae within the Polygalales.

<text>The Blackmore Vale (; less commonly spelt Blackmoor) is a vale, or wide valley, in north Dorset, and to a lesser extent south Somerset and southwest Wiltshire in southern England.

==Geography==
The vale is part of the Stour valley and part of the natural region known as the Blackmoor Vale and Vale of Wardour. The southern periphery of the vale is in the Dorset National Landscape area.

To the south and east, the vale is clearly delimited by the steep escarpments of two areas of higher chalk downland, the Dorset Downs to the south, and Cranborne Chase to the east. To the north and west, the definitions of the vale are more ambiguous, as the landscape changes more gradually around the upper reaches of the Stour and its tributaries. One definition places the boundary along the watershed between the Stour and neighbouring valleys of the Yeo to the west and Brue to the north. A narrower definition places the limits of the vale close to the county boundary and villages like Bourton, where the landscape transitions to hillier greensand, limestone and sandstone geology. In her book on the Blackmore Vale, Hilary Townsend described the northern boundary as &quot;above Gillingham, through Motcombe to Queen Oak and Bourton, then crosses the A303, ignores the A30 and slips down on winding country roads past Bow Brook and Gibbs Marsh towards Sherborne&quot;; while she placed the western boundary outside the Stour watershed &quot;south of Sherborne down Dancing Hill, across the A352 and pick up the line of the River Yeo towards Beer Hackett, Yetminster and Chetnole&quot;.

The River Stour flows out of the vale at Blandford Forum in the southeast, a town sandwiched between the Dorset Downs and Cranborne Chase.

When viewed from above (e.g. from the chalk escarpments) the vale appears quite uniform - a large expanse of green, lush, low-lying land - but in geological terms it comprises alternating belts of different clay and limestone soils (and greensand at the foot of the chalk), which give rise to subtle variations in topography and appearance, and which affect land use. The majority of human settlements are built on the drier strips of limestone, whereas the more poorly draining clays (which comprise the greater bulk of the area) are more sparsely populated, supporting mostly small farms, dotted across the vale. Due to the clay soils, land use is predominantly dairy farming. Until it was closed in 1998, Sturminster Newton livestock market was the busiest weekly livestock market in Britain.

==Cultural associations==
The vale, in particular the village of Marnhull (&quot;Marlott&quot;), is the opening backdrop for Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Tess of the D&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;; he also lived and wrote in Sturminster Newton for a time. William Barnes the poet also lived in Sturminster Newton. Douglas Adams and Robert Boyle lived in Stalbridge for part of their lives.

The New Blackmore Vale Magazine is named for the area. 

==Towns and villages==
Settlements in the vale include:
* Belchalwell
* Bourton
* Child Okeford
* East Stour
* Gillingham
* Hazelbury Bryan
* Henstridge
* Hinton St Mary
* Horsington
* Marnhull
* Mere
* Motcombe
* Okeford Fitzpaine
* Shillingstone
* Stalbridge
* Stour Provost
* Stourton Caundle
* Sturminster Newton
* Templecombe
* Todber
* West Stour
* Shaftesbury, Sherborne and Wincanton are on the edges of the vale, but not actually in it.

<text>Oxalidales is an order of flowering plants, included within the rosid subgroup of eudicots. This group comprises six families that contain approximately 2000 species in 58 genera. They are trees, shrubs or woody vines which are found in the wet tropics, particularly on mountains, and warm temperate zones, especially in the southern hemisphere. Compound leaves are common in Oxalidales and the majority of the species in this order have five or six sepals and petals. The following families are typically placed here:

* Family Brunelliaceae
* Family Cephalotaceae (&quot;Cephalotus follicularis&quot;)
* Family Connaraceae
* Family Cunoniaceae
* Family Elaeocarpaceae
* Family Huaceae
* Family Oxalidaceae (wood sorrel family)

The family Cephalotaceae contains a single species, a pitcher plant found in Southwest Australia.

Under the Cronquist system, most of the above families were placed in the Rosales. The Oxalidaceae were placed in the Geraniales, and the Elaeocarpaceae split between the Malvales and Polygalales, in the latter case being treated as the Tremandraceae.

<text>The Crossosomatales are an order, first recognized as such by APG II. They are flowering plants included within the Rosid eudicots.

== Description ==
Species assigned to the Crossosomatales have in common flowers that are positioned solitarily, with the base of the calyx, corolla, and stamens fused into a tube-shaped floral cup, sepals overlapping, the outermost smaller than the inner. Insides of the casings of pollen grains have horizontally extended thin regions (or endo-apertures). The gynoecium is placed on a short stalk, papillae on the stigma consist of two or more cells, ovary locules taper upwards, and the protective cell layer (or integument) surrounding the ovule leaves a zigzag opening (or micropyle). Some cell clusters have bundles of long yellow crystals, mucilage cells are present, and seeds have a smooth, woody coating.

== Taxonomy ==
The relationships between orders within the Malvid clade, according to the APG system, is represented by the following tree.

Within the Crossosomatales, the APG III system of 2009 recognises families represented in the following tree.

<text>Berberidopsidales is an order of Southern Hemisphere woody flowering plants. The name is newly accepted in the APG III system of plant taxonomy. APG II system, of 2003, mentions the possibility of recognizing the order, as comprising the families Berberidopsidaceae and Aextoxicaceae. However, APG II left the families unplaced as to order, assigning them to the clade core eudicots. The APG III system of 2009 formally recognized the order.

The family Aextoxicaceae is a monotypic family native to Chile; Berberidopsidaceae is a family of 2 genera and 3 species native to Chile and eastern Australia.

<text>The BMW Championship is a professional golf tournament which is the penultimate FedEx Cup playoff event on the PGA Tour schedule. Introduced in 2007, the BMW Championship was previously known as the Western Open. The Western Golf Association, which founded and ran the Western Open, runs the BMW Championship. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, the PGA Tour named the BMW Championship its Tournament of the Year. The BMW Championship is the longest running regular PGA Tour event on the calendar outside of the four major tournaments.

==Western Open==

The Western Open was first played in 1899. For many years, the Western was played in and out of the state of Illinois, before eventually settling down in the Chicago area. The Western Golf Association (WGA) ran the Western Open throughout its entire history (1899–2006), and continues to run the tournament under its new title. These are, however, two entirely different events in terms of playing format and invitational criteria. The Western Open was like any other regular PGA Tour stop – although it was once considered to be one of golf&#x27;s majors. The BMW Championship is part of the FedEx Cup Playoffs, and only the leading FedEx Cup points earners at the start of the BMW event are eligible to play.

==Tournament format==

The BMW Championship is open to the leading FedEx Cup points earners on the PGA Tour following the FedEx St. Jude Championship. Through 2022, the top 70 players were qualified, after which it was reduced to the top 50. With a limited field, there is no 36-hole cut. The top 30 in the FedEx Cup points list following the BMW Championship advance to The Tour Championship, where the FedEx Cup champion is decided.

==Winners==

==Host venues==
Four of the first five editions of the BMW Championship were held at Cog Hill Golf &amp; Country Club, which had hosted the Western Open since 1991. Since 2011, no course has hosted in consecutive years, with the tournament moving throughout the Midwest and sometimes venturing into Colorado as well as the Mid-Atlantic region. The Chicago metropolitan area remains the most frequent location, having hosted the event ten times at four different courses.

<doc id="275163" wikidata="Q1367216" url="?curid=275163" title="Medical social work">
<text>Medical social work is a sub-discipline of social work that addresses social components of medicine. Medical social workers typically work in a hospital, outpatient clinic, community health agency, skilled nursing facility, long-term care facility or hospice. They work with patients and their families in need of psychosocial help. Medical social workers assess the psychosocial functioning of patients and families and intervene as necessary. The role of a medical social worker is to &quot;restore balance in an individual’s personal, family and social life, in order to help that person maintain or recover his/her health and strengthen his/her ability to adapt and reintegrate into society.&quot; Interventions may include connecting patients and families to necessary resources and support in the community such as preventive care; providing psychotherapy, supportive counseling, or grief counseling; or helping a patient to expand and strengthen their network of social supports. In short, a medical social worker provides services in three domains: intake and psychosocial assessment, case management and supportive therapy, and discharge planning and ongoing care that extends after hospitalization. They are also involved in patient and staff education, as well as with policy research for health programs. Professionals in this field typically work with other disciplines such as medicine, nursing, physical, occupational, speech, and recreational therapy.

==History==
The history of medical social work is intertwined with the history of social medicine. Dr. Richard Cabot, a physician associated with one of the earliest medical social work departments, noted that the active efforts to combat preventable diseases emerged through the actions of social workers. These actions included initiatives like the Anti-Tuberculosis Crusade, the Clean Milk Crusade, the Pure Food Law, the Playground Association, and the School of Hygiene.

===Britain===
Medical social workers in Britain and Ireland were originally known as hospital almoners or &quot;lady almoners&quot; until the profession was officially renamed medical social work in the 1960s. In 1895, Mary Stewart became the first lady almoner in Britain with her appointment to the Royal Free Hospital in London for a three-month trial period. Some sources credit Anne Cummins as the &quot;mother of almoners&quot; as she had the ability and the funding to first establish a comprehensive social work service at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital in London in 1909. Lady almoners determined the patient&#x27;s ability to contribute towards their own medical care at charity hospitals. This approach was also followed by Australia during its vassal period with Great Britain. They adopted an approach similar to strength-based case management, and formal education for almoners was introduced in Australia in the early 1920s to carry out the required tasks.

In 1922, the Institute of Hospital Almoners in Britain was formed. A group focusing on the application of psychology to the treatment of mental illness separated from it and established the Association of Psychiatric Social Workers, largely due to the mental health courses provided by the London School of Economics in 1929. In 1964, two separate professional bodies of Hospital Almoners, one an institute and the other an association, merged to become the Institute of Medical Social Workers. These professional groups later merged with the British Association of Social Workers, which was formed in 1970. In Britain, medical social workers were transferred from the National Health Service (NHS) into local authority Social Services Departments in 1974 and generally became known as hospital social workers.
===China===
Medical social work was started in 1921 by Ida Pruitt in Beijing. In-service training was given to social workers for carrying out casework, adoption services and recuperation services.

===India===
Dr. Clifford Manshardt an American missionary in 1936 started formal training in social work in India through Dorabji Tata Graduate School of Social Work. The first medical social worker was appointed in 1946 in J.J. Hospital, Bombay. In 1960s scope of medical social workers increased in India.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the origins of medical social work go back to paediatrician Ella Webb, the first physician in Ireland to appoint almoners to work in her dispensary for sick children that she established in the Adelaide Hospital in Dublin, and to Winifred Alcock, the first almoner appointed by Webb in 1918.

===Singapore===
Almoners from St Thomas’ Hospital, London, who arrived in Singapore in 1948 and 1949 are recognized as the forerunners of hospital social worker&#x27;s in Singapore. Medical Social Worker is a Singapore Ministry of Health recognized profession for psychosocial care and a required professional by bylaw in every clinical specialty department.

===United States===
The Massachusetts General Hospital was the first American hospital to have professional social workers on site, in the early 1900s. Garnet I. Pelton, Ida Maud Cannon and Dr. Richard Clarke Cabot were the central figures of the hospital social work. Clarke credited his approach as similar to that of Anne Cummins in London. The establishment of medical social work services in the United States is attributed to the inspirational and insightful efforts of the Society for the Aftercare of the Insane in England, the reorganization of Lady Almoners&#x27; work by C.S. Loch and Colonel Montefiore, the visiting nurses who conducted the final medical tasks of the hospitals, and the social service training Dr. Charles P. Emerson provided to medical students at Johns Hopkins University. Cannon started specific training for medical social workers in 1912. The major duties carried out by medical social workers were case management, data collection, follow ups, care coordination, health education, financial assessment and discounting patient medical fees. However, historically, social workers began engaging independently in the healthcare field much earlier. In 1893, Jane Addams established a medical dispensary at Chicago&#x27;s Hull House. In 1912, social worker Anne Moore conducted a study on possible dispensary abuse in New York County. This was during a time when the prevailing belief about poverty was that it was an outcome of consequentialism. Moore found that 90% of the patients were deserving of free treatment. A survey conducted in 1976 revealed that half of the directors in federally mandated health planning bodies were social workers, and more than 17,000 social workers provided their services at varying levels in Medicare participating hospitals.

<text>The Gunnerales are an order of flowering plants. In the APG III (2009) and APG IV systems (2016), the order contains two genera: &quot;Gunnera&quot; (family Gunneraceae) and &quot;Myrothamnus&quot; (Myrothamnaceae). In the Cronquist system (1981), the Gunneraceae were in the Haloragales and Myrothamnaceae in the Hamamelidales. DNA analysis proved definitive, but the grouping of the two families was a surprise, given their very dissimilar morphologies. In the older systems of Cronquist (1981, 1988) and Takhtajan (1997), the Gunneraceae were in the Rosidae, and the Myrothamnaceae were in the Hamamelids. In modern classification systems, such as APG III and APG IV, this order was the first to diverge from the core eudicots. Some of the oldest fossils come from fossils dating the Aptain stage in places like Antarctica, Egypt and Argentina with these early pollen samples being known as &quot;Tricolpites&quot;. At that time those landmasses were part of the continent known as Gondwana.

==Description==
Both families contain ellagic acid. Phloem cells contain a large number of plastids and the leaves have dented borders.

The plants are dioecious and possess small flowers without perianth, and the stigma is, at least weakly, secretory. Gunnerales characters shared with the core eudicots are cyanogenesis via phenylalanine, metabolic pathways of isoleucine or valine, presence of the DNA sequence of PI-dB motif, and is common to have a small deletion in the sequence of 18S ribosomal DNA. The characters which it shares with the core eudicots, and also with Buxales and Trochodendrales, are an absence of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, &quot;euAP3&quot; + &quot;TM6&quot; genes (gene duplication &quot;paleoAP3&quot;: Class B), and a loss of the mitochondrial gene &quot;rps2&quot;.

==Ecology==
Despite being related, the Myrothamnaceae and the Gunneraceae look very different:
* The Gunneraceae are a mesophilic herb (often oversized), and the hydathodes are well developed and secrete mucilage or perhaps a resinous coating.
* The Myrothamnaceae are a reviviscent shrub of arid habitats, and the hydathodes are poorly developed and secrete plant resin.
Both have flowers without perianth, but the details of pollen (e.g. Zavada and Dilcher see 1986 10, Wanntorp et al. 2004th 2004b 11 and 12) differ. In Wilkinson 2000 13 is a table of differences.

<text>In computing, a polyglot is a computer program or script (or other file) written in a valid form of multiple programming languages or file formats. The name was coined by analogy to multilingualism. A polyglot file is composed by combining syntax from two or more different formats. 

When the file formats are to be compiled or interpreted as source code, the file can be said to be a polyglot program, though file formats and source code syntax are both fundamentally streams of bytes, and exploiting this commonality is key to the development of polyglots. Polyglot files have practical applications in compatibility, but can also present a security risk when used to bypass validation or to exploit a vulnerability.

==History==
Polyglot programs have been crafted as challenges and curios in hacker culture since at least the early 1990s. A notable early example, named simply codice_1 was published on the Usenet group rec.puzzles in 1991, supporting eight languages, though this was inspired by even earlier programs. In 2000, a polyglot program was named a winner in the International Obfuscated C Code Contest.

In the 21st century, polyglot programs and files gained attention as a covert channel mechanism for propagation of malware. Polyglot files have practical applications in compatibility.

==Construction==

A polyglot is composed by combining syntax from two or more different formats, leveraging various syntactic constructs that are either common between the formats, or constructs that are language specific but carrying different meaning in each language. A file is a valid polyglot if it can be successfully interpreted by multiple interpreting programs. For example, a PDF-Zip polyglot might be opened as both a valid PDF document and decompressed as a valid zip archive. To maintain validity across interpreting programs, one must ensure that constructs specific to one interpreter are not interpreted by another, and vice versa.
This is often accomplished by hiding language-specific constructs in segments interpreted as comments or plain text of the other format.

==Examples==

===C, PHP, and Bash===

Two commonly used techniques for constructing a polyglot program are to make use of languages that use different characters for comments, and to redefine various tokens as others in different languages. These are demonstrated in this public domain polyglot written in ANSI C, PHP and bash:

Note the following:
*A hash sign marks a preprocessor statement in C, but is a comment in both bash and PHP.
*&quot;//&quot; is a comment in both PHP and C and the root directory in bash.
*Shell redirection is used to eliminate undesirable outputs.
*Even on commented out lines, the &quot;codice_2&quot; and &quot;codice_3&quot; PHP indicators still have effect.
*The statement &quot;codice_4&quot; is valid in both PHP and bash; C #defines are used to convert it into &quot;codice_5&quot; at compile time.
*Comment indicators can be combined to perform various operations.
*&quot;codice_6&quot; is a valid statement in both bash and PHP.
*codice_7 is a bash shell builtin which is identical to the C printf except for its omission of brackets (which the C preprocessor adds if this is compiled with a C compiler).
*The final three lines are only used by bash, to call the codice_8 function. In PHP the codice_8 function is defined but not called and in C there is no need to explicitly call the codice_8 function.

===DOS batch file and Perl===

The following file runs as a DOS batch file, then re-runs itself in Perl:

 @rem = &#x27; --PERL--
 @echo off
 perl &quot;%~dpnx0&quot; %*
 goto endofperl
 @rem &#x27;;

Highlighted for Perl

 @rem = &#x27; --PERL--
 @echo off
 perl &quot;%~dpnx0&quot; %*
 goto endofperl
 @rem &#x27;;
 #!perl
 print &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;;
 :endofperl

This allows creating Perl scripts that can be run on DOS systems with minimal effort. Note that there is no requirement for a file to perform exactly the same function in the different interpreters.

==Types==
Polyglot types include:

* &quot;stacks&quot;, where multiple files are concatenated with each other
* &quot;parasites&quot; where a secondary file format is hidden within comment fields in a primary file format
* &quot;zippers&quot; where two files are mutually arranged within each others&#x27; comments
* &quot;cavities&quot;, where a secondary file format is hidden within null-padded areas of the primary file.

==Benefits==
===Polyglot markup===

Polyglot markup has been proposed as a useful combination of the benefits of HTML5 and XHTML. Such documents can be parsed as either HTML (which is SGML-compatible) or XML, and will produce the same DOM structure either way. For example, in order for an HTML5 document to meet these criteria, the two requirements are that it must have an HTML5 doctype, and be written in well-formed XHTML. The same document can then be served as either HTML or XHTML, depending on browser support and MIME type.

As expressed by the &quot;html-polyglot recommendation&quot;, to write a polyglot HTML5 document, the following key points should be observed:

# Processing instructions and the XML declaration are both forbidden in polyglot markup
# Specifying a document’s character encoding
# The DOCTYPE
# Namespaces
# Element syntax (i.e. End tags are not optional. Use self-closing tags for void elements.)
# Element content
# Text (i.e. pre and textarea should not start with newline character)
# Attributes (i.e. Values must be quoted)
# Named entity references (i.e. Only amp, lt, gt, apos, quot)
# Comments (i.e. Use &lt;!-- syntax --&gt;)
# Scripting and styling polyglot markup

The most basic possible polyglot markup document would therefore look like this:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; lang=&quot;&quot; xml:lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;The title element must not be empty.&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
In a polyglot markup document non-void elements (such as codice_11, codice_12, codice_13) cannot be self-closing even if they are empty, as this is not valid HTML. For example, to add an empty textarea to a page, one cannot use codice_14, but has to use codice_15 instead.

===Composing formats===

The DICOM medical imaging format was designed to allow polyglotting with TIFF files, allowing efficient storage of the same image data in a file that can be interpreted by either DICOM or TIFF viewers.

===Compatibility===

The Python 2 and Python 3 programming languages were not designed to be compatible with each other, but there is sufficient commonality of syntax that a polyglot Python program can be written than runs in both versions.

==Security implications==

A polyglot of two formats may steganographically compose a malicious payload within an ostensibly benign and widely accepted wrapper 
format, such as a JPEG file that allows arbitrary data in its comment field. A vulnerable JPEG renderer could then be coerced into executing the payload, handing control to the attacker. The mismatch between what the interpreting program expects, and what the file actually contains, is the root cause of the vulnerability.

SQL Injection is a trivial form of polyglot, where a server naively expects user-controlled input to conform to a certain constraint, but the user supplies syntax which is interpreted as SQL code.

Note that in a security context, there is no requirement for a polyglot file to be strictly valid in multiple formats; it is sufficient for the file to trigger unintended behaviour when being interpreted by its primary interpreter.

Highly flexible or extensible file formats have greater scope for polyglotting, and therefore more tightly constrained interpretation offers some mitigation against attacks using polyglot techniques. For example, the PDF file format requires that the magic number codice_16 appears at byte offset zero, but many PDF interpreters waive this constraint and accept the file as valid PDF as long as the string appears within the first 1024 bytes. This creates a window of opportunity for polyglot PDF files to smuggle non-PDF content in the header of the file. The PDF format has been described as &quot;diverse and vague&quot;, and due to significantly varying behaviour between different PDF parsing engines, it is possible to create a PDF-PDF polyglot that renders as two entirely different documents in two different PDF readers.

Detecting malware concealed within polyglot files requires more sophisticated analysis than relying on file-type identification utilities such as file. In 2019, an evaluation of commercial anti-malware software determined that several such packages were unable to detect any of the polyglot malware under test.

In 2019, the DICOM medical imaging file format was found to be vulnerable to malware injection using a PE-DICOM polyglot technique. The polyglot nature of the attack, combined with regulatory considerations, led to disinfection complications: because &quot;the malware is essentially fused to legitimate imaging files&quot;, &quot;incident response teams and A/V software cannot delete the malware file as it contains protected patient health information&quot;.

===GIFAR attack===

A Graphics Interchange Format Java Archives (GIFAR) is a polyglot file that is simultaneously in the GIF and JAR file format. This technique can be used to exploit security vulnerabilities, for example through uploading a GIFAR to a website that allows image uploading (as it is a valid GIF file), and then causing the Java portion of the GIFAR to be executed as though it were part of the website&#x27;s intended code, being delivered to the browser from the same origin. Java was patched in JRE 6 Update 11, with a CVE published in December 2008.

GIFARs are possible because GIF images store their header in the beginning of the file, and JAR files (as with any ZIP archive-based format) store their data at the end.

<doc id="275178" wikidata="Q1483514" url="?curid=275178" title="Searing">
<text>Searing or pan searing is a technique used in grilling, baking, braising, roasting, sautéing, and the like, in which the surface of the food (usually meat such as beef, poultry, pork, or seafood) is cooked at high temperature until a browned crust forms. Similar techniques, such as browning and blackening, are typically used to sear all sides of a particular piece of meat, fish, poultry, etc. before finishing it in the oven. To obtain the desired brown or black crust, the meat surface must exceed , so searing requires the meat surface be free of water, which boils at around .

Although often said to &quot;lock in the moisture&quot; or &quot;seal in the juices&quot;, in fact, searing results in a greater loss of moisture than cooking to the same internal temperature without searing. Nonetheless, it remains an essential technique in cooking meat for several reasons:

*The browning creates desirable flavors through the Maillard reaction.
*The appearance of the food is usually improved with a well-browned crust.
*The contrast in taste and texture between the crust and the interior makes the food more interesting.

Searing does not cause caramelization, which affects only sugars, or simple carbohydrates; the Maillard reaction involves reactions between amino acids and some sugars.

Typically in grilling, the food will be seared over very high heat and then moved to a lower-temperature area of the grill to finish cooking. In braising, the seared surface flavors and colors the cooking liquid.

== Reverse searing ==

In reverse searing, the order of cooking is inverted. First the item to be cooked, typically a steak, is cooked at low heat until the center reaches desired temperature; then the outside is cooked with high temperature to achieve the Maillard reaction. This technique is typically recommended for thicker pieces of meat, or thicker, allowing for consistent internal cooking temperature with only the outer portion becoming seared.

==Sealing in the juices==
The belief that searing meat &quot;seals in the juices&quot; is widespread and still often repeated. This theory was first put forth by Liebig around 1850. The notion was embraced by contemporary cooks and authors, including Escoffier. It is typically mentioned for larger cuts, especially steaks and chops, of non-poultry meats such as beef, pork, lamb and tuna.

Experiments to test the theory were carried out as early as the 1930s and found that the seared roasts lost the same amount of moisture or more. Generally more liquid is lost, since searing exposes the meat to higher temperatures that destroy more cells, in turn releasing more liquid.

Moisture in liquid and vapor form continues to escape from a seared piece of meat. For this reason, searing is sometimes done at the end of the cooking process to gain the flavor benefits of the Maillard reaction, as well as the benefits of cooking for a greater duration with more moistness.

<doc id="275181" wikidata="Q895457" url="?curid=275181" title="Bowling Green State University">
<text>Bowling Green State University (BGSU) is a public research university in Bowling Green, Ohio, United States. The main academic and residential campus is south of Toledo, Ohio. The university has nationally recognized programs and research facilities in the natural and social sciences, education, arts, business, health and wellness, humanities and applied technologies. The institution was granted a charter in 1910 as a normal school, specializing in teacher training and education. The university has developed from a small rural normal school into a comprehensive public research university. It is a part of the University System of Ohio and is currently classified as R2: Doctoral Universities with high research activity.

In 2019, Bowling Green offered over 200 undergraduate programs, as well as master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees through eight academic colleges. BGSU had an on-campus residential student population of approximately 6,000 students and a total enrollment of over 19,000 students . The university also maintains a satellite campus, known as BGSU Firelands, in Huron, Ohio, east of the main campus. Although the majority of students attend classes on BGSU&#x27;s main campus, about 2,000 students attend classes at Firelands and about 600 additional students attend online. About 85% of Bowling Green&#x27;s students are from Ohio.

The university hosts an extensive student life program, with over 300 student organizations. Fielding athletic teams known as Bowling Green Falcons, the university competes at the NCAA Division I level as a member of the Mid-American Conference in all sports except ice hockey, in which the university is a member of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association.

==History==

=== 1800s–1920: Early history ===
====Background====
The movement for a public high learning institution in northwestern Ohio began in the late 1800s as part of the growth in public institutions during the Progressive Era to meet demands for training and professional development of teachers. During the period, people of northwestern Ohio campaigned for a school in their region to produce better quality education and educators. The movement argued that the existing universities, Ohio State University in Columbus, Miami University in Oxford and Ohio University in Athens, were distant and the region lacked a state-supported school of its own.

====Lowry Bill====
In 1910, the Ohio General Assembly passed the Lowry Normal School Bill that authorized Governor Judson Harmon to appoint the Commission on Normal School Sites to survey forty communities for two sites for normal schools, one in northeastern Ohio and one in northwestern Ohio. The commission examined population within a radius of each community, along with railroad and transportation infrastructure, the moral atmosphere, health and sanitary conditions and site suitability. 

Bowling Green offered four possible sites and became one of four finalists including Fremont, Napoleon, and Van Wert. Despite the town being the home of John Lowry, Napoleon was ruled out because the commission found it had numerous saloons. Fremont was eliminated mainly due to the specific stipulations imposed by the President Rutherford B. Hayes Memorial Commission. Bowling Green was chosen on November 10, 1910, over Van Wert in a 3–2 vote by the commission. The site located on of primarily rural land and a small town park, nearby railroad and transportation infrastructure, its central location in the region, and Bowling Green&#x27;s dry status were major factors that the town was chosen by the commission. At the same time, the commission chose Kent for a school in Northeastern Ohio. Over the years 1911 and 1912, the board of trustees was appointed by the Governor and elected a school president on February 16, 1912. A campus plan was created and $150,000 was appropriated to develop the campus and construct the first buildings.

====Founding====

The school opened on September 15, 1914, as Bowling Green State Normal School in two temporary locations at the Bowling Green Armory and at a branch school in Toledo for the 1914–1915 academic year. The first honorary organization of the college, the &quot;Book and Motor&quot; was conceived around this time. It initially enrolled 304 students from Ohio, Michigan, and New York who were taught by 21 faculty members. The school graduated its first class in 1915, consisting of 35 certified teachers. University Hall and Williams Hall opened that year, the school&#x27;s first two permanent buildings. Two years later the first baccalaureate degrees for teacher education were awarded. The university began to invite notable guests to campus during the 1917–1918 semester, including the Zoellner Quartet, and the Ben Greet Shakespearean Players. 

On March 28, 1920, a tornado, part of the 1920 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak, damaged three of the school&#x27;s buildings. The tornado touched down near Bowling Green and strengthened as it moved into Ottawa County where it killed two people in Genoa.

=== 1920–1940 ===
====Early expansion====
Over the next decade the school expanded academic facilities, athletics and student life, as enrollment grew to over 900 students. On October 28, 1927, Ivan &quot;Doc&quot; Lake, a BGSU graduate and sports editor of the &quot;Daily Sentinel-Tribune&quot;, established the nickname &quot;Falcons&quot;. Lake thought the nickname fit with the school&#x27;s colors. Prior to &quot;Falcons,&quot; sports writers used various other names, including: &quot;B.G. Normals&quot;, &quot;Teachers&quot;, and the &quot;B.G. Pedagogues&quot;. The school achieved the status of college in 1929 when the Emmons-Hanna Bill renamed it to Bowling Green State College (BGSC). At the same time, the college expanded its curriculum through the addition of the College of Liberal Arts, now known as the College of Arts and Sciences.
====Great Depression====

Enrollment levels held steady into the Great Depression, with enrollment surpassing 1,000 for the first time in 
1931. However, in 1933, the Ohio State Senate Welfare Commission proposed a plan to convert the school into a mental health institution. Students, faculty and administrators organized with the Bowling Green community to counter the proposal. The Student Protest Committee coordinated with the faculty and administration to organize a campus rally and march through the downtown Bowling Green. Members of the Protest Committee then launched a letter-writing campaign to community leaders throughout northwest Ohio, which helped convince the state legislature that closing the school would be counterproductive. The measure was defeated by a 14–5 vote. A few years later, in May 1935, the college was granted university status and changed its name to Bowling Green State University. The university added the College of Business Administration to the existing College of Education and College of Liberal Arts. Within a year BGSU added master&#x27;s degree programs in Education, English, History, Social Science and Mathematics. In 1938 the university adopted an official tenure policy. In 1939 the university began training pilots, led by instructor Mike Murphy at the Findlay Airport. In 1939, the university established The Committee for Gifts, Endowments, and Memorials, its first private endowment fund.

=== 1940–1960 ===
==== World War II ====

The 1940s, including World War II and its aftermath, brought big changes to BGSU. The war caused a drastic decrease in male enrollment and by 1943, the university canceled dances and formals, citing the lack of male students. 

The university continued expanding facilities including its first student union, The Falcon&#x27;s Nest, and new cottage-style dorms for social groups and learning-living communities, and dedication of the Wood County airport. Bowling Green was one of 240 colleges and universities to take part in the V-5 and V-12 Navy College Training Programs to supplement the lower enrollment during the war. The programs offered students a path to a Navy commission, enrolling cadets in regular college courses as well as naval training. Faculty were added to accommodate the military training programs. 

Student life adapted to the wartime era with efforts such as the War Relief Committee, blood drives and War Bonds initiatives. In December 1942 Sherwood Eddy spoke on campus on topics relating to the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. In July 1944 the university was selected by officials at Camp Perry as a potential temporary prisoner of war camp.

==== Post-war era expansion ====
In the post-war era, BGSU constructed temporary structures to keep up with the increased housing demands for veterans and their families. BGSU added 40 trailers to house male and married students in 1945, known as &quot;Falcon Heights&quot;. In 1946, the university added 15 steel buildings to house male students in an area near the football stadium that became known as &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot;. By the late 1940s, the student house shortage became so severe that the nearby National Guard Armory and ODOT garage were converted to house male students. 

The Federal Housing Authority provided two wooden barracks, ten trailers, and more steel buildings. The BGSU Army ROTC was established on campus in 1948 as enrollment increased dramatically in the post war era. The university continued to add academic programs as the enrollment increased during the mid to late 1940s, including the Graduate School in 1948 after Dr. Emerson Shuck led the effort to create school. In 1948 the university hosted the world premiere of the last play by Lennox Robinson, &quot;The Lucky Finger&quot;. By 1950, enrollment grew to new record highs, with over 5,000 students.

1951 saw major changes when Ralph W. McDonald was appointed the fourth president in school history, following the retirement of Frank Prout. McDonald was the first university president from outside Ohio and came to BGSU with a focus on improving teacher education and certification standards. Prior to becoming president, he served as the Executive Secretary of the Department of Higher Education of the National Education Association for seven years. Under McDonald, BGSU reorganized its three colleges to group common departments together within each college. Reflecting the Cold War era, BGSU added an Air Force ROTC program and a Department of Air Science and Tactics. BGSU continued to add programs and in the early 1950s added a Master of Education (M.Ed.) and a Master of Science (M.S.) in Education. The university constructed new residence halls during the decade, Prout Hall in 1955 and Founders Quadrangle in 1957. The new student center opened in 1958. In the years 2012–2014, the residence hall was renovated and remodeled.

===1960–1990===

The College of Education experienced rapid growth and expansion during the 1960s when the university added various specialized education programs, including majors in special education, school psychology, guidance and counseling and vocational rehabilitation counseling. It expanded arts and music programs when the music department became the College of Education&#x27;s first &quot;school&quot;, renamed the School of Music in 1961. Specializations in guidance and counseling were added to the Master of Arts and Master of Education degrees in 1964; as well as a new department for teaching college administration. By 1965, BGSU&#x27;s College of Education enrolled 5,470 students and was ranked the 16th largest producer of teachers in the United States. The university added new academic, administrative, and athletic facilities during the 1960s. Memorial Hall, later known as Anderson Arena, opened in 1960. 

The new Administration Building opened in 1964 and the William T. Jerome Library opened in 1967. Student activism became common in the 1960s, reflecting the various social and political events of the time period. Vietnam War protests were common in downtown Bowling Green and on campus. 

In 1969, a Black Student Union formed to encourage unity, scholarship, leadership, culture and political awareness of African Americans students. The majority of student activism at BGSU was peaceful and Bowling Green was the only public college or university in Ohio to reopen in the spring of 1970, following the Kent State shootings during anti-war protests. Bowling Green added two colleges in the early 1970s when the College of Health and Human Services opened in 1973 and the School of Music was elevated to the College of Musical Arts in 1975. 

In addition to the new colleges, the BGSU Popular Culture Center opened in 1970 as one of the first pop culture centers in the United States. In 1978, the university established the University Honors Program.

Throughout the 1970s construction continued, starting with the Mathematical Sciences Building, followed by the Offenhauer Towers in 1971 and Industrial Education &amp; Technology Building in 1972. The Business Building and the Industrial Arts Building opened in 1973 and University Hall received renovations in 1974 that included new seating, an improved sound system, and air conditioning in the auditorium. In 1979, the Student Recreation Center and the Moore Musical Arts Center opened. In 1970, the Board of Trustees ended an alcoholic beverage ban on campus. The Cardinal Room, an on-campus eatery, began serving beer. A growing trend in the late 1960s and early 1970s was the development of large apartment complexes adjacent to campus. 

By the 1970s approximately 4,000 students lived in private, off-campus housing. On campus, Darrow Hall became the first co-ed residence hall in 1972 with men and women inhabiting alternating floors.

In 1981, the university hosted Xing-Fang Olu, a geneticist from Fudan University to study cytogenetics, and sent its own Jong Sik Yoon to teach at Fudan in return. This was the first such exchange in Ohio since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In 1984, ties were strengthened with Fudan University, along with then Xi&#x27;an Foreign Language Institute, following a visit to china by university president Olscamp, and establishment of more regular exchange programs.

The School of Technology was given college status in 1985 and renamed the College of Technology. The university expanded many of the technology and science facilities during the 1980s, including constructing the Planetarium and Physical Sciences Building. In 1985, Ronald Reagan became the seventh president or president-elect to visit the university after Warren G. Harding, Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford. 

=== 1990–2008 ===
During the 1990s the university renovated and constructed many buildings.

In 1993, the Electric Vehicle Institute of the College of Technology began working on an electric race-car known as the Electric Falcon, and had it racing by 1994. The vehicle used a liquid cooled 255 horsepower three phase AC induction motor and reached a top speed of 140 mph. The vehicle was donated to the Crawford Auto-Aviation Museum in 2010.

In 1996, student government elections began allowing for Electronic voting over the internet.

In 2006, the university established an electro-mechanical systems technology program.

=== 2008–2019 ===
The Stroh Center, a 5,000-seat arena to replace the aging Anderson Arena, opened in 2011, hosting basketball and volleyball in addition to graduation ceremonies, concerts, and other events. 

In 2009, the university began construction on the Wolfe Center for the Arts. The facility opened in 2011 with performance space, as well as work and classroom areas for art studies of the School of Art, the Department of Theatre and Film, and the College of Musical Arts. That same year, BGSU built a $40 million residence hall project that included two new residence halls, one a traditional-style dorm and a second suite-style for upperclassmen. The residence hall project added more than 800 beds. In the fall of 2011, BGSU opened The Oaks dining hall. 

The Oaks was constructed with sustainable designs that included a hybrid solar and wind power system to fulfill Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), an electric-powered truck to distribute food on campus, and a rooftop garden. The building used sustainable and recycled construction materials.

In Fall of 2016 the university began offering a degree in Mechatronics engineering. In 2016 and 2017, three major renovations were complete to three original campus building, totaling about $70 million. The former South Hall was re-opened in fall 2016 after undergoing a $24 million renovation and renaming to The Michael and Sarah Kuhlin Center. The building is home to BGSU&#x27;s School of Media and Communications. Following a $25 million renovation and restoration, University Hall re-opened in Fall 2017. It was originally built in 1915 as one of the first buildings on campus. Today, University Hall houses the Office of Admissions, classrooms and active learning spaces. Also, in Fall 2017, Moseley Hall reopened, following a $21 million restoration and renovation. Moseley Hall, built in 1916, originally housed the university&#x27;s agricultural science program. Today, it features technologically advanced laboratories for chemistry, biology, geology, and medical lab science.

== Campuses ==

===Bowling Green===

The main academic and residential campus is located on the northeast side of Bowling Green. The campus is arranged in a rectangle roughly long and wide. It includes over 116 buildings on . The campus is bordered by Wooster Street to the south, Thurstin Avenue to the west, Poe Road to the north, and I-75 to the east. The university also owns buildings and parking lots throughout Bowling Green and the Bowling Green Research Enterprise Park just east of I-75. Ridge Street and East Merry Street run east–west through campus and Mercer Street bisects campus on a north–south axis.

====Old Campus====

The oldest portion of the BGSU campus is located in the southwest corner and hosts the original campus buildings. This area offers green space with large trees and historic buildings built in the early 1900s. Administrative services and classrooms occupy these buildings. Although not part of the historic section, Founders Hall, a large dorm, is located on the Southwest corner. Hanna Hall housed &quot;The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Film Theater and Gallery&quot; prior to its renovation as the Maurer Center. Dedicated to BGSU in 1976, it features early film memorabilia and highlights the careers of both Lillian Gish and Dorothy Gish. The theater was renovated and rededicated in 1990. It seated 168 and was home to &quot;Tuesdays at the Gish&quot;, an International Film Series, and a Sunday Matinee Series, which were free and open to the community. On May 3, 2019, the trustees voted to remove the Gish name from the theatre following calls to do so from the Black Student Union and a subsequent task force report, which found that naming the theatre after Lillian Gish created a &quot;non-inclusive learning environment&quot; due to her involvement with &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;.

Mike Kaplan, co-producer of &quot;The Whales of August&quot; (1987), Lillian Gish&#x27;s final film, circulated a petition urging Bowling Green State University to restore the names of the Gish sisters to the film theater. The protest was signed by over 50 film industry figures, including actors Dame Helen Mirren, James Earl Jones, Malcolm McDowell, and Lauren Hutton, and directors George Stevens Jr., Peter Bogdanovich, Bertrand Tavernier, Joe Dante, and Martin Scorsese.

<text>The Haunted Mansion is a dark ride attraction located at Disneyland, Magic Kingdom, and Tokyo Disneyland. The haunted house attraction features a ride-through tour in Omnimover vehicles called &quot;Doom Buggies&quot;, and a walk-through show is displayed to riders waiting in the queue line. Each location differs slightly in design, utilizing a range of technology from centuries-old theatrical effects to modern special effects, including spectral Audio-Animatronics. The Haunted Mansion inspired two similarly themed but distinct attractions, Phantom Manor and Mystic Manor, which exist at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland, respectively.

The Haunted Mansion attraction launched a small franchise including two feature film adaptations, comic strips, television specials and merchandise.

== Ride summary ==
=== Disneyland ===

Guests enter the mansion&#x27;s grounds through the front gate and walk through a garden containing a pet cemetery and a carriage led by an invisible horse. Once inside, the deep voice of the invisible Ghost Host introduces himself in the foyer. Guests enter the mansion&#x27;s art gallery, which contains four paintings, each depicting a person from the chest up. While the Ghost Host challenges guests to find a way out, the room stretches vertically, and the portrait frames appear to elongate, revealing grim fates depicted in humorous fashion. This room is used to transport guests underground where the main attraction is located.

The room goes dark, the ceiling vanishes, and lightning flashes to reveal the cupola, in which hangs the Ghost Host&#x27;s skeletal corpse from the rafters by a noose, implying that he committed suicide by hanging to try to escape. A shriek is then heard, followed by the sound of bones shattering. The Ghost Host apologizes, and a wall opens, exposing the portrait corridor leading to the loading area. The subjects of the portraits on the right flicker briefly into macabre versions of themselves when lighting flashes from the windows on the left. At the end of the corridor are two busts who appear to &quot;follow&quot; the guests with their gazes due to the Hollow-Face illusion.
In the load area, black carriages called &quot;Doom Buggies&quot; descend one staircase and ascend another to the second floor. 

Guests pass by a candelabra floating down an endless hallway. Near the hallway&#x27;s entrance is a moving suit of armor and a chair with an abstract face. The Doom Buggies then turn to view a glass conservatory filled with dead flora surrounding a casket whose occupant is heard calling out for help to escape; his bony hands are seen trying to pry the casket lid open. The Doom Buggies then travel down a hallway of doors where sounds of pounding, calls for help, screams, knocking, and maniacal laughter can be heard from behind the doors. Knockers and handles move independently, and some doors appear to be &quot;breathing.&quot; Guests then pass by a demonic grandfather clock, while a shadow of a claw passes over it.

Guests enter a dark séance room that contains occult objects. Madame Leota, a blue-haired medium whose disembodied head appears within a levitating crystal ball, summons the Mansion&#x27;s spirits. Floating musical instruments respond in turn to her spell.

After leaving the séance circle, guests move onto a mezzanine overlooking a massive ballroom where many ghosts are enjoying a birthday party. Ghosts fly into the room from a crashed hearse and the windows. Several ghosts sit at the table where one blows out the candles of a birthday cake. When she blows out the candles, the other ghosts seated at the table disappear to then reappear when she &quot;inhales&quot; again. Playing on the chandelier over the dining table are several drunken ghosts holding glasses of red wine. Six ghost couples waltz to music played by a gentleman&#x27;s spirit on a pipe organ, several wraiths fly out of its pipes as the haunting refrain echoes throughout the scene. Hanging on the wall are the portraits of two duelists who come to life and fire their revolvers at each other. Guests enter the attic filled with portraits. In each portrait, the same bride is seen with a different groom, who disappears only to reappear a moment later. Guests then see an invisible pianist playing a sinister version of the &quot;Bridal March&quot;. The ghost of the mourning bride is nearby, who is holding the same candelabra seen earlier as she floats while her heart glows red and beats in time with the music.

The Doom Buggies drift out of an attic window and onto a balcony towards the Hatbox Ghost amidst a starry night sky. The Doom Buggies then fall backward underneath dead trees that have humanoid faces. Reaching the ground, they turn towards the gate of a private graveyard, where guests see a frightened caretaker holding a lantern and a shovel with his dog cowering at his feet. Around the corner, ghosts have risen from their graves and are partying enthusiastically. Ghouls also pop up from behind the gravestones, some of which appear to move. In the graveyard are multiple comical sights, such as a skeleton&#x27;s hand popping out of a hole in a tomb, a duo of ghosts singing opera, a king and queen balancing a seesaw on a gravestone and a duchess sipping a cup of tea. Guests also pass by a group of five busts singing the attraction&#x27;s theme song &quot;Grim Grinning Ghosts&quot;. Near the end of the graveyard, guests can see the candelabra floating once more.

The Doom Buggies enter a large crypt where the Ghost Host warns guests about hitchhiking ghosts as the vehicles pass a group of three ghosts thumbing for a ride. Around the corner, in large mirrors, the guests see that one of the ghosts from the trio is in the buggy with them. The guests then disembark their Doom Buggies and begin to leave the mansion. A small ghost known as Little Leota encourages them to return and to bring their &quot;death certificates.&quot;

=== Magic Kingdom ===

The Haunted Mansion was an opening-day attraction at Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World, where it is part of Liberty Square. During the production and assembly of the props and audio-animatronics for Disneyland&#x27;s Haunted Mansion, duplicates of everything were being made for Walt Disney World&#x27;s Haunted Mansion. It was decided that the Florida version of the attraction would be slightly longer and more elaborate than its California counterpart with extra scenes such as the library and the music room. Paul Frees recorded additional voice-overs, including the &quot;Ghost Host&quot; to accompany the extra scenes in the ride. Because of the ample space within the park, the attraction&#x27;s show building is much larger and not restricted by any railroad berm. 

In the Foyer, there is a portrait of the Aging Man from the Disneyland version. The stretching rooms are not elevators; instead the ceiling rises. After this, the door opens to the Doom Buggy loading area. 

Upon boarding, guests pass under the staircase, with a candelabra floating above, then pass the changing portraits as seen in the queue at Disneyland. Then the guests go through the library where busts of ghost writers stare and follow them when they pass by as also seen in the queue at Disneyland. Once they enter the music room, an invisible pianist plays a sinister version of “Grim Grinning Ghosts” and into the Endless Staircase, where footprints can be seen and candelabras are blown out occasionally by unseen ghosts.
Passing by bat-eyed wallpaper that glows in the dark, the guests see the Endless Hallway, but the Hatbox Ghost appears next to it from a blue door, his footprints visible in front of the Hallway. Passing through the conservatory where a corpse tries to get out while crying for help, the guests travel through the corridor of doors. A demonic grandfather clock chimes 13.

Guests then enter the seance room, where Madame Leota is seen floating and reciting her spell as instruments play. A green specter floats alongside the instruments. The Doom Buggies enter the mezzanine of a ballroom, where ghosts have gathered for a party before proceeding to the attic. Here, the piano player can be heard, but not seen. However, the bride is now blue and white and has a stained hatchet.

The Doom Buggies pass through the cemetery, where many of the ghosts are singing Grim Grinning Ghosts and into the crypt, where the Hitchhiking Ghosts are playing around in the mirrors. Little Leota appears above the vehicles as guests disembark and pass a mausoleum and then a pet cemetery. 

In 2011, the queue&#x27;s graveyard was reworked and expanded into an interactive experience, consisting of a Composer&#x27;s Crypt designed after the Ballroom&#x27;s pipe organ, the water-spouting crypt of Captain Culpepper Clyne (originally created by Ken Anderson for the ride), a library-inspired mausoleum for a poet named Prudence Pock (related to Phineas Pock) that asks for help with rhyming couplets, and a set of busts with a murder mystery attached to them. When passing the graveyard gates in the queue, guests see six head busts, two on one stand, that contain the Dread Family: a family that killed each other for wealth. The members are Uncle Jacob, Bertie, Aunt Florence Dread (née McGriffin), twins Wellington and Forsythia, and Cousin Maude. Bertie killed Jacob with poison from his snake, Florence killed Bertie for revenge with her gun, Wellington and Forsythia killed Florence as revenge for Florence doing a rogue shot and killing their pet canary, and Maude killed the twins with her croquet mallet. Maude accidentally killed herself by forgetting that she put matches in her hair to hold her bun together and setting a fire that killed her, a solution that is shown in a painting added to the Hitchhiking Ghost vignette. At this time, the Hitchhiking Ghosts mirror effect was also updated to replace the physical figures with computer-animated ghosts playing around with the images of riders&#x27; reflections.

=== Tokyo Disneyland ===
Like the Magic Kingdom version, the Tokyo Disneyland version of the Haunted Mansion was an opening day attraction, but is relocated to Fantasyland rather than Liberty Square. This version is largely a duplicate of the Magic Kingdom version, although it has some minor differences, such as a haunted painting of a man vaguely resembling Peter Lorre whose face pops out and stretches, a tall, legless ghost in the Séance Room, and more advanced lighting. The attraction did not receive the changes made in the 2007 refurbishment of the Magic Kingdom version.

== History ==
=== Development ===
The idea for the Mansion precedes Disneyland and WED Enterprises, dating to when Walt Disney hired the first of his Imagineers. At the time, the park they were developing the attraction for was supposed to be located across from the studios. In 1951, the first known illustration of the park showed a main street setting, green fields, western village and a carnival. Disney Legend Harper Goff developed a black-and-white sketch of a crooked street leading away from main street by a peaceful church and graveyard, with a run-down manor perched high on a hill that towered over main street.

Disney assigned Imagineer Ken Anderson to create a story using Goff&#x27;s idea. Plans were made to build a New Orleans-themed land in the small transition area between Frontierland and Adventureland. Weeks later, New Orleans Square appeared on the souvenir map and promised a thieves market, a pirate wax museum, and a haunted house walk-through. Anderson studied New Orleans and old plantations, landing on an image of the Shipley-Lydecker House in Baltimore, Maryland. He came up with a drawing of an antebellum manor with features from the Baltimore house, overgrown with weeds, dead trees, swarms of bats and boarded doors and windows topped by a screeching cat as a weathervane.

Disney, however, rejected the idea of having a run-down building in his park. He visited the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, California, and was captivated by the massive mansion with its stairs to nowhere, doors that opened to walls and holes, and elevators. Anderson envisioned stories for the mansion, including tales of a ghostly sea captain who killed his nosy bride and then hanged himself, a mansion home to an unfortunate family, and a ghostly wedding party with well-known Disney villains and spooks.

In 1961, handbills announcing a 1963 opening of the Haunted Mansion were given out at Disneyland&#x27;s main entrance. Construction began a year later, and the exterior was completed in 1963. The attraction was previewed in a 1965 episode of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot;, but the attraction itself did not open until 1969. The six-year delay owed heavily to Disney&#x27;s involvement in the New York World&#x27;s Fair in 1964–1965 and to an attraction redesign after Disney&#x27;s death in 1966.

After the fair, many Imagineers such as Marc Davis, X Atencio and Claude Coats contributed ideas to the project. By this time, Anderson had left the project. Rolly Crump showed Disney some designs for his version, which included bizarre objects like coffin clocks, candle men, talking chairs, man-eating plants, tiki-like busts, living gypsy wagons and a mirror with a face. Disney accepted these ideas and wanted to make the proclaimed &quot;Museum of the Weird&quot;, a restaurant side to the now-named Haunted Mansion, similar to the Blue Bayou at Pirates of the Caribbean.

When Disney put Imagineers Crump and Yale Gracey in charge of creating illusions for the attraction, they intended to make the &quot;Museum of the Weird&quot; into a separate section that guests could walk through, where they could see transparent ghosts and other apparitions utilizing the Pepper&#x27;s Ghost technique used in the theater since the early 1800s. Crump and Gracey were eventually given a large workshop to develop their ideas. One night, the two Imagineers decided to play a prank on the night cleaning crew. As Crump explained: &quot;…We got a call from personnel saying that the janitors requested that we leave the lights on in there due to the creepiness of all the audio-animatronic ghosts and such. We complied, but put motion sensors in the room that would extinguish the lights and turn on all the ghost effects when triggered. The next morning, we came in and found all the ghost effects still running and a broom lying in the center of the floor. Personnel called and said that the janitors would not be back.&quot;

Davis and Coats, two of the Mansion&#x27;s main designers, disagreed on whether the ride should be frightening or funny. Coats, originally a background artist, wanted a scary adventure, and produced renditions of moody surroundings like endless hallways, corridors of doors, and bleakly spooky environments. Davis, an animator and character designer, proposed a variety of mostly comical characters, and thought the ride should be silly and full of gags. In the end, both artists got their ways when Atencio combined their approaches and ideas, creating a transition from dark foreboding to &quot;spirited&quot; entertainment. The ride narration was performed by Paul Frees in the role of the Ghost Host. The attraction&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Grim Grinning Ghosts&quot;, was composed by Buddy Baker with lyrics by Atencio. Different versions of it can be heard in nearly every area of the ride.

After Disney&#x27;s death in December 1966, the project evolved significantly. The Museum of the Weird restaurant idea was abandoned. The Imagineers objected to a walk-through attraction&#x27;s low capacity, going so far as suggesting building two identical attractions to accommodate twice as many guests. A solution appeared with the development of the Omnimover system for Adventure Thru Inner Space. Renamed the Doom Buggy, the system&#x27;s continuous chain of semi-enclosed vehicles offered high capacity. The cars could be set to rotate in any direction at any point, allowing the Imagineers to control what guests saw and heard. Because each car held from one to three people, it was a convenient way to divide guests into smaller groups—a better fit with the story of people wandering alone through a haunted house.

=== Debut ===

Employee previews of the Mansion were held August 6, 7, and the 8th, followed by &quot;soft&quot; openings on August 9 and 10 where limited numbers of park guests were allowed to ride. A &quot;Midnight&quot; Press Event was held on the evening of August 11. The Mansion opened to all guests on August 12, 1969.

In around 1977, WDI considered utilizing the unused designs, creatures and effects that Rolly Crump had originally created for the Haunted Mansion and the Museum of the Weird as part of Professor Marvel&#x27;s Gallery—&quot;a tent show of mysteries and delights, a carousel of magic and wonder,&quot; to be built as part of Disneyland&#x27;s Discovery Bay expansion area. The idea was dropped when the expansion&#x27;s plans fell through.

=== Updates ===

In 1994, Disneyland&#x27;s Haunted Mansion was updated. A phantom piano player sat at a run-down piano in the attic scene, whereas the original faceless bride was given a full-fleshed appearance. In 2001, a newer, more detailed safety spiel was added to the Doom Buggies&#x27; onboard audio as they left the loading area. Recorded by voice-over artist Joe Leahy in English and Fabio Rodriguez in Spanish, in a recreation of the character of original actor Paul Frees&#x27; Ghost Host, the bilingual spiel was part of a park-wide campaign to increase safety. The seasonal overlay Haunted Mansion Holiday also premiered in October, featuring characters from the 1993 film &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;.

In 2004, the Seance Room was updated so the crystal ball with the talking head of Madame Leota floated above its table rather than sitting stationary on it, with the original projection-mapped effect replaced by a rear-projection effect within the ball. In 2006, the original attic bride was replaced by Constance Hatchaway and a storyline for the new character.

In 2007, the attraction was renovated, with changes including the installation of the changing portraits and lightning-filled windows from the Disneyland version, and new vocals for most of the ghosts in the graveyard. In the Walt Disney World location, an endless staircase was added after being previously a dark space with spider webs. The portrait hall was originally decorated with portraits, known as the Sinister 11, situated on both sides and on a doorway, all of which have eyes that stared at guests as they pass through; these were later transferred to the load area during the refurbishment and their eyes no longer followed guests.

In March 2011, a new &quot;interactive queue&quot; debuted at the Walt Disney World location, with new crypts and tombstones honoring Imagineers; a murder mystery for guests to solve featuring the sinister Dread Family; the Composer Crypt, which features musical instruments that play variations of &quot;Grim Grinning Ghosts&quot; when touched; the Mariner&#x27;s brine-filled sepulcher, whose ghost sings and sneezes from within, and a crypt for Prudence Pock the poetess, which features haunted moving books and Prudence&#x27;s ghost writing invisibly in her poem book. Guests can solve the unfinished poems by speaking into microphones located on the crypt. The FastPass+ line skips the queue altogether and leads guests straight to the Foyer doors. There is also an extended queue line that uses the former Mike Fink Keel Boats dock.

On April 10, 2015, it was officially confirmed that an iconic Haunted Mansion character, The Hatbox Ghost, would return to Disneyland&#x27;s Haunted Mansion. The character returned on May 9, 2015. The Hatbox Ghost was originally a part of the attraction when it opened in 1969, but was removed when the illusion involving the specter&#x27;s head was not convincing enough. The Hatbox Ghost was added to Disney World&#x27;s Haunted Mansion on November 30, 2023, as part of The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s 100th Anniversary celebration.

On April 2, 2019, PhotoPass ride photography was added to the attraction at Magic Kingdom. A hidden camera takes pictures of the riders as the doom buggy passes the final portrait in the portrait gallery, with the flash disguised as flickering lightning. A black and white photo featuring the riders framed by several of the ghosts surrounding the photo is automatically added to the guests&#x27; PhotoPass account by reading the RFID data from the guest&#x27;s second-generation MagicBand.

On January 21, 2020, Disneyland&#x27;s Haunted Mansion was closed for an extensive refurbishment to add lighted steel panels, improved lighting, mechanical touch ups, and new paint and trims to the exterior of the attraction. The changes were originally scheduled for completion in spring 2020, but an extended park closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic created uncertainty. It was later confirmed that the refurbished attraction would reopen with the park on April 30, 2021. This refurbishment came with a refreshed pet cemetery, now with new greenery and plants. The portrait gallery was given new drapes curtains and the loading area received more decorative with wallpaper and the return of one of the Haunted Mansion&#x27;s original portraits being &quot;April to December&quot;. Also featuring a statue of the one-eyed cat. The rest of the attraction was given repairs and new lighting. In addition, new secret entrance was added to the ride by using an exit. Once the crypt door opened, visitors would be directed down a flight of stairs and through a utility passageway usually used by cast members.

In January 2024, the Disneyland Haunted Mansion began another extensive refurbishment to reform and expand the outdoor queue, modify the nearby Magnolia Park in New Orleans Square, and add a gift shop at the ride&#x27;s exit. The expansion opened on November 26, 2024; the new grounds include a accessible elevator while the gift shop, which is themed to be the mansion&#x27;s carriage house, opened on December 23, 2024.

In January 2025, the attraction at Disneyland received a new bride inspired by the original version of the character and storyline. In addition, the hitchhiking ghosts scene was updated.

== Other versions ==
=== Haunted Mansion Holiday ===
The Haunted Mansion at Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland is transformed into Haunted Mansion Holiday during the Halloween and Christmas seasons and has been since 2001, inspired by Tim Burton&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. The Haunted Mansion is closed in mid to late August for a few weeks as they revamp the attraction before opening again in September, replacing many of the props and Audio-Animatronics with characters and themes from the movie. The Haunted Mansion Holiday closes in early January to restore the attraction back to the original Haunted Mansion and reopens late January.

The Magic Kingdom does not have its own holiday edition of the Haunted Mansion and the regular ride operates continuously through the holiday season.

=== Related attractions ===
Disneyland Paris features Phantom Manor, a &quot;re-imagined&quot; version of the Haunted Mansion. The house is a Western Victorian, in the Second Empire architectural style, based on the look of the Fourth Ward School House in Virginia City, Nevada. Along with the Western architectural style, the attraction uses a Western plot to fit in with the Thunder Mesa and Frontierland backdrop.

Mystic Manor opened at Hong Kong Disneyland in spring 2013. Unlike the Haunted Mansion, however, it does not include references to departed spirits or the afterlife, due to differences in traditional Chinese culture. Continuing the Society of Explorers and Adventurers theme of Tokyo DisneySea, the attraction tells the story of Lord Henry Mystic and his monkey Albert. Having recently acquired an enchanted music box with the power to bring inanimate objects to life, Albert opens the box and brings all of the house&#x27;s artifacts to life. The attraction&#x27;s exterior is that of a large Victorian mansion in an elaborate Queen Anne architectural style, and the experience features a trackless &quot;ride&quot; system and a musical score by Danny Elfman.

==Adaptations==
Walt Disney Pictures produced two standalone theatrical live-action feature film adaptations based on the attraction:

The first adaptation, &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot;, was directed by Rob Minkoff and starred Eddie Murphy was released on November 26, 2003.

The second adaptation, &quot;Haunted Mansion&quot;, was directed by Justin Simien and released on July 28, 2023. In July 2010, Guillermo del Toro announced that he was set to write and produce a darker film adaptation also based on the attraction, promising that it would be both scary and fun. The film was officially confirmed in July 2021, with Tiffany Haddish playing a hired psychic that attempts to commune with the dead and LaKeith Stanfield playing a lackluster tour guide in New Orleans&#x27;s French Quarter.

<doc id="275187" wikidata="Q1156248" url="?curid=275187" title="England and Wales">
<text>England and Wales () is one of the three legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom. It covers the constituent countries England and Wales and was formed by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. The substantive law of the jurisdiction is English law.

The devolved Senedd (Welsh Parliament; ) – previously named the National Assembly for Wales – was created in 1999 under the Government of Wales Act 1998 and provides a degree of self-government in Wales. The powers of the legislature were expanded by the Government of Wales Act 2006, which allows it to pass its own laws, and the Act also formally separated the Welsh Government from the Senedd. There is currently no equivalent body for England, which is directly governed by the parliament and government of the United Kingdom.

==History of jurisdiction==
During the Roman occupation of Britain, the area of present-day England and Wales was administered as a single unit, except for the land to the north of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall – though the Roman-occupied area varied in extent, and for a time extended to the Antonine/Severan Wall. At that time, most of the native inhabitants of Roman Britain spoke Brythonic languages, and were all regarded as Britons, divided into numerous tribes. After the conquest, the Romans administered this region as a single unit, the province of Britain.

Long after the departure of the Romans, the Britons in what became Wales developed their own system of law, first codified by Hywel Dda (Hywel the Good; reigned 942–950) when he was king of most of present-day Wales (compare King of Wales); in England Anglo-Saxon law was initially codified by Alfred the Great in his Legal Code, . However, after the Norman invasion of Wales in the 11th century, English law came to apply in the parts of Wales conquered by the Normans (the Welsh Marches). In 1283, the English, led by Edward I, with the biggest army brought together in England since the 11th century, conquered the remainder of Wales, then organised as the Principality of Wales. This was then united with the English crown by the Statute of Rhuddlan of 1284. This aimed to replace Welsh criminal law with English law.

Welsh law continued to be used for civil cases until the annexation of Wales to England in the 16th century by the Welsh House of Tudor. The Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 then consolidated the administration of all the Welsh territories and incorporated them fully into the legal system of the Kingdom of England. This was in part to update outdated Welsh laws, but also to control Wales alongside England; through these acts, the Welsh could be seen as equals to the English. This was reflected on both Henry VIII and Elizabeth I&#x27;s coat of arms where the dragon represented Wales and the lion represented England. As soon as the Tudor dynasty ended with the death of Elizabeth I, however, the red dragon of Wales was dropped and replaced with the unicorn of Scotland with the succession of King James I who demoted Wales&#x27; status on the coat of arms and on the first adaptation of the Flag of Great Britain.

Prior to 1746, it was not clear whether a reference to &quot;England&quot; in legislation included Wales, and so in 1746, Parliament passed the Wales and Berwick Act 1746. This specified that in all prior and future laws, references to &quot;England&quot; would by default include Wales (and Berwick-upon-Tweed). The Wales and Berwick Act was repealed by the Welsh Language Act 1967, although the statutory definition of &quot;England&quot; created by that Act still applies for laws passed before 1967. In new legislation since then, what was referred to as &quot;England&quot; is now &quot;England and Wales&quot;, while subsequent references to &quot;England&quot; and &quot;Wales&quot; refer to those political divisions.

=== Wales jurisdiction ===

There have been multiple calls from both Welsh academics and politicians for a Wales criminal justice system.

==Law==
England and Wales are treated as a single unit for some purposes, because the two form the constitutional successor to the former Kingdom of England. The continuance of Scots law was guaranteed under the 1706 Treaty of Union that led to the Acts of Union 1707, and as a consequence English lawand after 1801, Irish lawcontinued to be separate. Following the two Acts of Union, Parliament can restrict the effect of its laws to part of the realm, and generally the effect of laws, where restricted, was originally applied to one or more of the former kingdoms. Thus, most laws applicable to England also applied to Wales. However, Parliament now passes laws applicable to Wales and not to England (and vice versa), a practice which was rare before the middle of the 20th century. Examples are the Welsh Language Acts 1967 and 1993 and the Government of Wales Act 1998. Measures and Acts of the Senedd apply in Wales, but not in England.

Following the Government of Wales Act, effective since May 2007, the Senedd can legislate on matters devolved to it. Following a referendum on 3 March 2011, the Senedd gained direct law-making powers, without the need to consult Westminster. This was the first time in almost 500 years that Wales had its own powers to legislate. Each piece of Welsh legislation is known as an Act of Senedd Cymru.

===Company registration===
For a company to be incorporated in the United Kingdom, its application for registration with Companies House must state &quot;whether the company&#x27;s registered office is to be situated in England and Wales (or in Wales), in Scotland or in Northern Ireland&quot;, which will determine the law applicable to that business entity. A registered office must be specified as &quot;in Wales&quot; if the company wishes to use a name ending &quot;cyfyngedig&quot; or &quot;cyf&quot;, rather than &quot;Limited&quot; or &quot;Ltd.&quot; or to avail itself of certain other privileges relating to the official use of the Welsh language.

==Other bodies==
Outside the legal system, the position is mixed. Some organisations combine as &quot;England and Wales&quot;, others are separate.
* In sports, cricket has a combined international team (simply called &quot;England&quot;) administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board, who also govern the sport across both nations, and Glamorgan County Cricket Club participates in the English and Welsh county cricket system. In football, rugby union, rugby league, the Commonwealth Games and other sports have separate national representative teams for each country. A few Welsh association football clubs, most notably Cardiff City F.C. and Swansea City A.F.C., play in the English football league system, while The New Saints F.C., which represents places on both sides of the border, plays in the Welsh football league system. The Anglo-Welsh Cup was a rugby union competition contested by Welsh regions and English Premiership clubs between 1971 and 2018.
* Some religious denominations organise on the basis of England and Wales, most notably the Roman Catholic Church, but also small denominations, e.g. the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. Prior to the disestablishment of the Church in Wales in 1920, the Anglican church in Britain operated under the jurisdiction of the Church of England throughout Wales and England.
* The Electoral Commission maintains a register of political parties, organised according to where the party operates (either &quot;England&quot;, &quot;Wales&quot; or &quot;England and Wales&quot;). The Green Party of England and Wales stands candidates only in English and Welsh constituencies; separate Green parties exist in Scotland and in Northern Ireland.
* Some professional bodies represent England and Wales, for example the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the General Council of the Bar, The Law Society, the National Farmers Union and the Police Federation of England and Wales.
* Other examples include the Canal &amp; River Trust, the Charity Commission, the General Register Office for England and Wales, His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services, HM Land Registry, His Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service, Mountain Rescue England and Wales, the Worshipful Company of Chartered Accountants and the Youth Hostels Association.

==Order of precedence==
The order of precedence in England and Wales is distinct from those of Northern Ireland and Scotland, and from Commonwealth realms.

==National parks==
The national parks of England and Wales have a distinctive legislative framework and history.

<text>Rexhep Qemal Meidani (; born on 17 August 1944) is an Albanian physicist, professor, diplomat and politician. Meidani was the president of Albania from 1997 to 2002, and the second to be elected after the first multi-party elections in 1991.

== Education and work in academia ==
Meidani earned a degree in physics from the Faculty of Natural Sciences at the University of Tirana in 1966. He completed postgraduate studies at the University of Caen in France in 1974. He also holds PhDs from the University of Paris XI and the University of Tirana. 

From 1966 to 1996, Meidani held various roles at the University of Tirana, including professor, department chair, and later, dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences. During this period, he authored numerous studies, books, and articles, both within and outside of Albania.

== Political career ==
Meidani&#x27;s political career began in the 1990s. He assumed the role of the chair of the Central Election Commission during the inaugural multiparty elections in 1991 and was a member of the Presidential Council in the same year. From 1992 to 1996, he actively participated in civil society, serving as the chair of the Board of the Albanian Center of Human Rights from 1994 to 1996. Joining the Socialist Party in 1996, Meidani was elected its Secretary General from 1996 to 1997.

Following his election to the Albanian Assembly in the parliamentary elections of June 1997, Meidani became a member of parliament. Subsequently, after the left coalition, led by the Socialist Party, emerged victorious in the elections, he was proposed by the SP and, on 24 July 1997, was elected as the President of Albania by the Albanian Assembly. He held the office until 2002, with Petrit Ago as his counsellor.

In the 2005 Socialist Party Leadership Convention, convened to select a successor to Fatos Nano, Meidani faced defeat at the hands of the present Chairman of the Socialist Party, Edi Rama.

<doc id="275195" wikidata="Q1002508" url="?curid=275195" title="Buggery Act 1533">
<text>The Buggery Act 1533, formally An Acte for the punishment of the vice of Buggerie (25 Hen. 8. c. 6), was an Act of the Parliament of England that was passed during the reign of Henry VIII.

It was the country&#x27;s first civil sodomy law, such offences having previously been dealt with by the ecclesiastical courts.

The term buggery, not defined in the text of the legislation, was later interpreted by the courts to include only anal penetration and bestiality, regardless of the sex of the participants, but not oral penetration. The act remained in force until it was repealed and replaced by the Offences Against the Person Act 1828 (9 Geo. 4. c. 31). Buggery remained a capital offence until 1861, though the last executions were in 1835.

== Description ==
The Act was piloted through Parliament by Henry VIII&#x27;s minister Thomas Cromwell (though it is unrecorded who actually wrote the bill), and punished &quot;the detestable and abominable Vice of Buggery committed with Mankind or Beast&quot;. Prior to the 1550s, the term &quot;Buggery&quot; was not used in a homosexual sense, rather related to any sexual activity not related to procreation, regardless of sex or species involved in the sexual act, and also covered sexual crimes of a non-consensual nature. The law was not designed to police sexual activity, rather was simply taking a canon law and making it a civil law, a test case in removing church power. &quot;Buggery&quot; was not further defined in the law. According to the Act:
This meant that a convicted sodomite&#x27;s possessions could be confiscated by the government, rather than going to their next of kin, and that even priests and monks could be executed for the offence—even though they could not be executed for murder. In moving what had previously been an offence tried by ecclesiastical courts into the secular ones, Henry may have intended it as a simple expression of political power along with other contemporary acts such as Submission of the Clergy Act 1533 and one year before the Act of Supremacy 1534. However Henry later used the law to execute monks and nuns (thanks to information his spies had gathered) and take their monastery lands—the same tactics had been used 200 years before by Philip IV of France against the Knights Templar.

In July 1540, Walter Hungerford, 1st Baron Hungerford of Heytesbury, was charged with treason for harbouring a known member of the Pilgrimage of Grace movement. He was also accused of buggery, as he was suspected of raping his own daughter. Hungerford was beheaded at Tower Hill, on 28 July 1540, the same day as Thomas Cromwell.

Nicholas Udall, a cleric, playwright, and Headmaster of Eton College, was the first to be charged with violation of the Act alone in 1541, for sexually abusing his pupils. In his case, the sentence was commuted to imprisonment and he was released in less than a year. He went on to become headmaster of Westminster School.

=== 16th-century repeal and re-enactment ===
The Act was repealed in 1553 on accession of the staunchly Catholic Queen Mary, who preferred such legal matters adjudicated in ecclesiastical courts. However, it was re-enacted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1562, &quot;An act for the punishment of the vice of buggery&quot;. Although &quot;homosexual prosecutions throughout the sixteenth century [were] sparse&quot; and &quot;fewer than a dozen prosecutions are recorded up through 1660 ... this may reflect inadequate research into the subject, and a scarcity of extant legal records.&quot; In 1631 Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven, was beheaded because of his rank. Numerous prosecutions that resulted in a sentence of hanging are recorded in the 18th and early 19th centuries.

Even if the charge of sodomy was reduced for lack of evidence to a charge of attempted buggery, the penalty was severe: imprisonment and some time on the pillory. &quot;The lesser punishment—to be stood in the pillory—was by no means a lenient one, for the victims often had to fear for their lives at the hands of an enraged multitude armed with as well as filth and curses ... the victims in the pillory, male or female, found themselves at the center of an orgy of brutality and mass hysteria, especially if the victim were a molly.&quot;

Periodicals of the time sometimes casually named known sodomites, and at one point even suggested that sodomy was increasingly popular. This does not imply that sodomites necessarily lived in security.

In &quot;Rex v Samuel Jacobs&quot; (1817), it was concluded that fellatio between an adult man and an underage boy was not punishable under this Act. The courts had previously established, in &quot;Rex v Richard Wiseman&quot; in 1716, that heterosexual sodomy was considered buggery under the meaning of the 1533 Act.

In light of &quot;R v Jacobs&quot;, fellatio thus remained lawful until the passage of Labouchere Amendment in 1885, which added the charge of gross indecency to the traditional term of sodomy.

The last two Englishmen who were hanged for sodomy were executed in 1835, when James Pratt and John Smith died in front of the Newgate Prison in London on 27 November.

=== Repeal in 1828 ===
The Act was repealed by section 1 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1828 (9 Geo. 4. c. 31) and by section 125 of the Criminal Law (India) Act 1828 (c. 74). It was replaced by section 15 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1828, and section 63 of the Criminal Law (India) Act 1828, which provided that buggery would continue to be a capital offence. The new Act expressly specified that conviction of buggery no longer required proof of completion (&quot;emission of seed&quot;) and that evidence of penetration was sufficient for conviction.

Buggery remained a capital offence in England and Wales until the enactment of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.

The United Kingdom Parliament repealed buggery laws for England and Wales in 1967 (in so far as they related to consensual homosexual acts in private between people over the age of 21), ten years after the Wolfenden report. Jurisdictions in many former colonies have retained such legislation, as in the Anglophone Caribbean. Heterosexual sodomy, i.e. anal sex, remained a criminal offence, regardless of consent, until the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 decriminalised it for adults. In 2001, the age of consent for male homosexual acts and for heterosexual anal sex was reduced from 18 to 16, which is also the age of consent for all other types of sexual intercourse.

<text>Campina Grande is the second most populous Brazilian city in the State of Paraíba after João Pessoa, the capital. It is considered to be the most important city of the Northeastern Brazilian subregion called &quot;agreste&quot;. It is considered one of the main industrial, technological and educational centers in the northeastern region of Brazil. Settled in the 17th century, the city was officially established in 1864. Campina Grande also has a large cultural agenda, including the world&#x27;s largest Saint John&#x27;s Festival (called &quot;O Maior São João do Mundo&quot;), which takes place during the entire month of June.

==History==
===Origin===
The founding of Campina Grande is credited to Captain Teodósio de Oliveira Ledo who led a group of Ariús Indians to settle the land and begin farming on December 1, 1697. However, some historians do not agree with this version and suggest that the place was already a settlement and named Campina Grande when Teodósio arrived with the Ariús. This position is certainly supported by the fact that Campina Grande is in a critical geographic location for people travelling between the highlands and the coast.

The political actions of Teodósio in mentioning Campina Grande to the king of Portugal in May 1699 went a long way to establishing the location as place of importance.

The Ariús inhabited a small farm made up of shacks which became the first street in the new community. Later, this street was called &quot;Rua do Oriente&quot; (Street of the East) and today it is known as &quot;rua Vila Nova da Rainha&quot; (New Village of the Queen). The Cathedral of Campina Grande was constructed on one of the higher slopes in the area. It formed the Matriz plaza which later also became one of city&#x27;s most important streets: Avenida Marechal Floriano Peixoto.

The village soon became a town because of the commerce it attracted and the fact that there were few settlements in Paraíba.

Campina Grande began as a small village situated in front of an old lake called &quot;Açude Velho.&quot; These people were known as &quot;tropeiros&quot; because they were traveling merchants who traded and sold goods such as meat, cotton clothes and corn flour among the cities and villages they passed by. Campina Grande became the village (Vila Nova da Rainha) that they rested in as they were coming from the coast to the west, and vice versa.

The introduction of the railroad caused this tiny village to develop into a bustling city. At the beginning of the 20th century, Campina Grande was called &quot;The Brazilian Liverpool&quot; because of the numerous cotton plantations and factories. At the time, it was the second biggest producer in the world.

Today, the city has added to its old and rich traditions by becoming an oasis of high technologies in the middle of northeastern Brazil.

===The town===

Campina Grande reached the category of town in 1790 with more than 100 houses. On April 6, 1790, it changed its name to &quot;de Vila Nova da Rainha&quot; (New Village of the Queen). At this point the town also began to have a formal government made up of a town council and Notary&#x27;s office.

Although the name of the town changed, the local inhabitants continued to call the place Campina Grande. However, in official documents the name, &quot;de Vila Nova da Rainha,&quot; was the only one used.

The town&#x27;s development was spurred on by the growth of the regional cotton industry which preferred to ship its product through Campina Grande.

At this point the town included a large area of almost ,including many smaller villages in the area.

The creation of the Village of Cabaceiras in 1835 and the Village of Alagoa Nova in 1850 reduced the area Campina Grande controlled.

In 1829, a dam across the Piabas stream was started and this became the lake referred to as Açude Velho. In 1852 the population of the town had reached 17,900 people, but in 1856, an epidemic killed almost 1,550 people. So many bodies arrived at the churches that they didn&#x27;t have enough room to bury them.

===The city===
On October 11, 1864, Campina Grande was raised to the category of city. It was not the first to reach this designation though. In 1846, Areia had been designated a city and dominated the region economically, politically and culturally. Although Campina Grande was not as established as Areia, it was really not any smaller than that city. At this time, the city of Campina Grande had three plazas, four streets and about 300 houses. Of these, there still exist today the two churches: the Matriz (the cathedral) and the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary. The latter had been destroyed at one time, but was rebuilt. Although there was plenty of commercial activity, there was very little actual construction of houses and government buildings. By the end of the nineteenth century, Campina Grande still only had about 500 houses.

In the year 1864 a building was constructed for the marketing of goods. This area had many names over time: &quot;Largo do Comércio Novo&quot;, &quot;Praça da Uruguaiana&quot;, &quot;Praça das Gameleiras&quot;, &quot;Praça da Independência&quot; and finally, &quot;Praça Epitácio Pessoa&quot;. In 1870 a law banning the washing of clothes and animals in Açude Velho was proclaimed. On September 18, 1865, the metric system was made the official form of measurement in Campina Grande.

In 1874, a rebellion led by João Vieira occurred. João Vieira and a number of revolutionaries came down from the Bodopitá mountain range and invaded the city&#x27;s market. They broke into some money boxes and destroyed a few things. The revolt spread out across the region. Over time the rebels grew in numbers and became well armed. They were led by Manoel de Barros Souza and Alexandre de Viveiros. One of the objectives of Alexandre de Viveiros was to break into the city jail and liberate all the prisoners, including the father of Manoel de Barros Souza. They also planned to set the municipal offices on fire in order to destroy all the records kept there. However, over the next number of months the police force disrupted their plans. Alexandre de Viveiros was eventually imprisoned, but João Vieirad disappeared. After the revolt, the police abused the population without cause, arresting or punishing innocent citizens. Thus, the average person suffered both from the rebels and the police.

On March 25, 1877, a new municipal building was constructed next to the cathedral. It became one of the most elegant buildings in the state and initiated an area of fine homes.

In May 1891, a theatre was constructed for the purpose of both teaching and performance. This became the Colégio Alfredo Dantas.

The city continued to gradually develop, but economic and social changes really occurred only from the early 20th century. In this period, the railroad arrived and with it came cheaper and more varied products which impacted the local economy.

==Technological centre==
For a long time Campina Grande has had a strong technological focus. In 1967, the city was the first location in northeastern Brazil to receive a computer (at the Federal University of Campina Grande). Today, Campina Grande is a point of reference when it comes software development and computer science industries.

In April 2001, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine chose nine cities around the world that represented a new vision for technology. Brazil is represented on this list by Campina Grande and it was the only city chosen from Latin America. In 2003, it was mentioned again as the “Brazilian Silicon Valley,&quot;

The reason for this success is mostly due to technological research performed by the Federal University of Campina Grande. Since 1967, when the university obtained support to buy its first computer for US$500,000, the city has developed a tradition of technological excellence that is recognized around the world.

Campina Grande has approximately 50 software companies that contribute about 20% of the city&#x27;s total revenue.

<text>Sturminster Newton is a town and civil parish situated on the River Stour in the north of Dorset, England. The town is at the centre of the Blackmore Vale, a large dairy agriculture region around which the town&#x27;s economy is built, and is known as &#x27;the heart of the Blackmore vale&#x27;.

The town has shops, a primary and secondary school – Sturminster Newton High School – and a school and college catering for children with special educational needs. A market is held in the town on Mondays. One of the largest cattle markets in England used to be held here, but it was closed in 1998.

The town is noted for its connections with the authors Thomas Hardy and William Barnes, and as part of the historic West Country Carnival circuit.

==History==
Sturminster Newton was recorded in an Anglo-Saxon charter in 968 as &quot;Nywetone at Stoure&quot;, and in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Newentone&quot;. Newton refers to a new farm or estate, and Sturminster to a church (minster) on the Stour. Originally the two parts of the name referred to the settlements on the north and south of the river, but were combined to distinguish the town from Sturminster Marshall and other Newtons. The history of the town and surrounding area has been researched by the Sturminster Newton Heritage Trust, which runs the Sturminster Newton Museum in the Old Market Cross House in the centre of town. The Museum is open to visitors on some days every week.

Hidden on the hill above the bridge over the river are the ruins of Sturminster Newton Castle, a manor house rather than a defensive building. The 14th-century building stands on a crescent shaped mound which could be the site of an Iron Age hillfort. The town and castle were part of Sturminster Newton hundred.

Sturminster Newton is situated at a historic fording point on the River Stour. The ford was replaced in the 16th century with a six-arch stone bridge, and a quarter-kilometre embankment crossing the flood plain. The bridge was widened from in 1820. A 19th-century plaque affixed to the bridge states that anyone damaging the bridge would be transported to Australia as a felon.

The Sturminster Newton Heritage Trust runs the Sturminster Newton Mill on the south bank of the river and which has existed since at least 1016. The mill was restored in 1980 and is now a working museum watermill which is open to visitors on some days every week between the end of March and the end of September. The mill resumed commercial production of flour in 2020.

The town centre is built in a mixture of styles, including 17th- and 18th-century thatched cottages, Georgian stone buildings, and 19th-century brick buildings. Set back from the main road is the market square and parish church of St Mary, which was rebuilt in 1486 by the abbots of Glastonbury. The church was heavily modified in the 19th century, but the carved wagon roof remains.

Sturminster Newton railway station was served by the Somerset and Dorset Railway, which ran through the town from 1863 until it was dismantled in 1966 as part of the Beeching Axe. The railway goods yard gave milk trains access to the private sidings of the local creamery. Started in 1913 by local farmers to produce cheddar cheese and pasteurised milk, it was taken over by the Milk Marketing Board in 1937. Milk trains ceased in 1966 on closure of the line, with the creamery remaining in operation until 2000 under successor Dairy Crest. The station and goods yard were demolished in the mid-1970s.

The town is set in the vale on which Thomas Hardy based his fictional &quot;Vale of the little dairies&quot; (in his novel &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;) and Sturminster had the largest cattle market in Europe, which stood close to the town centre until it was closed and demolished in 1997.

==Governance==
Sturminster Newton electoral ward elects one member to Dorset Council. The town also has a town council of 11 members.

In the UK parliament, Sturminster is in the North Dorset parliamentary constituency which is currently represented by Simon Hoare of the Conservative party.
==Geography==
Sturminster Newton civil parish covers about at an elevation of , with the highest ground being in the southeast.

The town is situated on a meander of the River Stour. The larger part of the town (Sturminster) lies on a low limestone ridge to the north side of the river, and includes most shops and services, whilst to the south is the smaller Newton, separated by a wide flood plain.

The geology of the parish comprises Oxford clay in the northwest, Corallian limestone and sands in the northeast, centre and southwest, and Kimmeridge clay in the southeast.

To the southeast of the town are Girdlers Coppice and Piddles Wood, areas of mature woodland that are designated as sites of special scientific interest.

Census data is for Sturminster Newton civil parish, which also includes the small settlements of Bagber, Broad Oak and Puxey.

==Religion and culture==

St Mary&#x27;s Church is a Church of England parish church, dating from a rebuild in 1486 by the abbots of Glastonbury. The church was heavily modified in the 19th century, but the carved wagon roof remains. It is designated as a Grade I listed building by Historic England.

Sturminster Newton is the home of the annual UK Boogie Woogie Festival, which in 2009 saw an appearance from veteran boogie woogie star Little Willie Littlefield.

The Exchange, a community arts and conference centre, on Old Market Hill, was built on the site of the old cattle market. It was officially opened by Julian Fellowes in December 2007 and provides a venue for music concerts, drama and other events.

The Dorset Bach Cantata Club is based in Sturminster Newton. Sturminster Newton United F.C., founded in 1871, play in the Dorset Premier Football League.

<doc id="275206" wikidata="Q1128431" url="?curid=275206" title="Vaginismus">
<text>Vaginismus is a condition in which involuntary muscle spasm interferes with vaginal intercourse or other penetration of the vagina. This often results in pain with attempts at sex. Often it begins when vaginal intercourse is first attempted. Vaginismus may be considered an older term for pelvic floor dysfunction.

The formal diagnostic criteria specifically require interference during vaginal intercourse and a desire for intercourse, but the term &quot;vaginismus&quot; is sometimes used more broadly to refer to any muscle spasm occurring during the insertion of objects into the vagina, sexually motivated or otherwise, including speculums and tampons.
The underlying cause is generally a fear that penetration will hurt. Risk factors include a history of sexual assault, endometriosis, vaginitis, or a prior episiotomy. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and examination. It requires there to be no anatomical or physical problems (e.g., pelvic floor dysfunction, vulvodynia, vestibulodynia, etc) and a desire for penetration.
Treatment may include behavior therapy such as graduated exposure therapy and gradual vaginal dilation. Surgery is not generally indicated. Botulinum toxin (botox), a muscle spasm treatment, is being studied. There are no epidemiological studies of the prevalence of vaginismus. Estimates of how common the condition is are varied. One textbook estimates that 0.5% of women are affected, but rates in clinical settings indicate that 5%–17% of women experience vaginismus. Outcomes are generally good with treatment.

==Signs and symptoms==
Physical symptoms may include burning, and sharp pain or pressure in and around the vagina upon penetration. Psychological symptoms include increased anxiety. Pain during vaginal penetration varies.

Despite being fairly common, there is low social awareness of vaginismus and women have difficulty finding support, even through the healthcare system. A 2023 integrative review found that studies on vaginismus show it often takes years to receive a diagnosis.

==Causes==

===Primary vaginismus===
Vaginismus occurs when penetrative sex or other vaginal penetration cannot be experienced without pain. It is commonly discovered among teenage girls and women in their early twenties, as this is when many girls and young women first attempt to use tampons, have penetrative sex, or undergo a Pap smear. Awareness of vaginismus may not happen until vaginal penetration is attempted. Reasons for the condition may be unknown.

A few of the main factors that may contribute to primary vaginismus include:
* chronic pain conditions like vulvodynia and harm-avoidance behavior
* negative emotional reaction toward sexual stimulation, e.g. disgust both at a deliberate level and a more implicit level
* strict conservative moral education, which also can elicit negative emotions

The cause of primary vaginismus is often unknown.

Lamont has classified vaginismus by severity. Lamont describes four degrees of vaginismus: In first-degree vaginismus, the person&#x27;s pelvic floor has a spasm that can be relieved by reassurance. In second-degree, the spasm is present but maintained throughout the pelvis even with reassurance. In third-degree, the person elevates the buttocks to avoid being examined. In fourth-degree (also known as grade 4) vaginismus, the severest form, the person elevates the buttocks, retreats, and tightly closes the thighs to avoid examination. Pacik expanded Lamont&#x27;s classification to include a fifth degree, in which the person experiences a visceral reaction such as sweating, hyperventilation, palpitations, trembling, shaking, nausea, vomiting, losing consciousness, wanting to jump off the table, or attacking the doctor.

Although the pubococcygeus muscle is commonly thought to be the primary muscle involved in vaginismus, Pacik identified two more spastic muscles in people who were treated under sedation. These include the entry muscle (bulbocavernosum) and the mid-vaginal muscle (puborectalis). Spasm of the entry muscle accounts for the common complaint that people often report when trying to have intercourse: &quot;It&#x27;s like hitting a brick wall&quot;.

=== Secondary vaginismus ===
Secondary vaginismus occurs when a person who has previously been able to achieve penetration develops vaginismus. This may be due to physical causes, such as a yeast infection or trauma during childbirth, psychological causes, or a combination of causes. The treatment for secondary vaginismus is the same as for primary vaginismus, although, in these cases, previous experience with successful penetration can assist in resolution of the condition. Peri-menopausal and menopausal vaginismus, often due to a drying of the vulvar and vaginal tissues as a result of reduced estrogen, may occur as a result of &quot;micro-tears&quot; first causing sexual pain then leading to vaginismus.

==Mechanism==
Specific muscle involvement is unclear, but the condition may involve the levator ani, bulbocavernosus, circumvaginal, or perivaginal muscles.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of vaginismus, as well as other diagnoses of female sexual dysfunction, can be made when &quot;symptoms are sufficient to result in personal distress.&quot; The &quot;DSM-IV-TR&quot; defines &quot;vaginismus&quot; as &quot;recurrent or persistent involuntary spasm of the musculature of the outer third of the vagina that interferes with sexual intercourse, causing marked distress or interpersonal difficulty&quot;.

== Treatment ==

A 2012 Cochrane review found little high-quality evidence regarding the treatment of vaginismus. Specifically, it is unclear whether systematic desensitisation is better than other measures, including nothing.

===Psychological===
According to a 2011 study, those with vaginismus are twice as likely to have a history of childhood sexual interference and held less positive attitudes about their sexuality, whereas no correlation was noted for lack of sexual knowledge or (nonsexual) physical abuse.

===Physical===
Often, when faced with a person experiencing painful intercourse, a gynecologist will recommend reverse Kegel exercises and provide lubricants. Although vaginismus has not been shown to affect a person&#x27;s ability to produce lubrication, additional lubricant can be helpful in achieving penetration. This is because women may not produce natural lubrication if anxious or in pain. Achieving sufficient arousal during foreplay is crucial for the release of lubrication, which can ease sexual penetration and pain-free intercourse.

Strengthening exercises such as Kegel exercises were previously considered a helpful intervention for pelvic pain, but new research suggests that these exercises, which strengthen the pelvic floor, may not be helpful or may make conditions caused by overactive muscles such as vaginismus worse. Exercises that stretch or relax the pelvic floor may be a better treatment option for vaginismus.

To help develop a treatment plan that best fits their patient&#x27;s needs, a gynecologist or general practitioner may refer a person experiencing painful intercourse to a physical therapist or occupational therapist. These therapists specialize in the treatment of disorders of the pelvic floor muscles, such as vaginismus, pelvic floor dysfunction, dyspareunia, vulvodynia, constipation, and fecal or urinary incontinence. After performing a manual exam internally and externally to assess muscle function and isolate possible trigger points for pain or muscle tightness, therapists develop a treatment plan consisting of muscle exercises, muscle stretches, dilator training, electrostimulation, and/or biofeedback. Treatment of vaginismus often involves Hegar dilators (sometimes called vaginal trainers), progressively increasing the size of the dilator inserted into the vagina. The technique is used to practice conscious diaphragmatic breathing (breathing in deeply allowing one&#x27;s belly to expand) and allowing the pelvic floor muscles to lengthen during inhale; then exhale, bringing belly in and repeat. Research suggests pelvic floor physical or occupational therapy is one of the safest and most effective treatments for vaginismus.

Many people find vaginal trainers like dilators helpful, but some often need more information on how to use them than is provided, or also seek out lubricant, topical anaesthetic or escitalopram, a medicine commonly used to treat depression and anxiety.

===Neuromodulators===
Botulinum toxin A (Botox) has been considered as a treatment option, with the idea of temporarily reducing the hypertonicity of the pelvic floor muscles. No random controlled trials have been done with this treatment, but experimental studies with small samples have found it effective, with sustained positive results through 10 months. Similar in its mechanism of treatment, lidocaine has also been tried as an experimental option.

Anxiolytics and antidepressants are other pharmacotherapies that have been offered to people in conjunction with other psychotherapy modalities and to people with high levels of anxiety from their condition. Evidence for these medications is limited.

== Epidemiology ==
There are no epidemiological studies of the prevalence of vaginismus. Estimates of how common the condition is varies. A 2016 textbook estimated about 0.5% of women are affected, while rates in Morocco and Sweden were estimated at 6%.

Among those who attend clinics for sexual dysfunction, rates may be as high as 12% to 47%.

==History==
The term vaginismus was developed by James Marion Sims in 1866 to describe the “hymeneal hyperaethesia with a spasmodic contraction of the sphincter vaginae” that, under examination, “will produce such agony as to cause the patient to shriek out, complaining at the same time that the pain is that of thrusting a sharp knife into the sensitive part.” At that time, the condition was understood to be biological in origin and medically treatable. During the 1930-1960s, under the influence of Freudian psychology, gynecologists increasingly understood vaginismus as psychological in origin. As psychology turned away from Freudian ideas and toward behaviorism, the condition was re-cast as a learned fear or anxiety response.

==In popular culture==
The Netflix miniseries &quot;Unorthodox&quot; depicted a young woman suffering from extreme pain during intercourse, which she was told was due to vaginismus.

The comedy feature film &quot;Lady Parts&quot;&#x27;s main character struggles with painful sex and later is diagnosed with vaginismus.

<doc id="275209" wikidata="Q255935" url="?curid=275209" title="Skvader">
<text>The skvader () is a Swedish fictional creature that was constructed in 1918 by the taxidermist Rudolf Granberg and is permanently displayed at the museum at Norra Berget in Sundsvall. It has the forequarters and hindlegs of a European hare (&quot;Lepus europaeus&quot;), and the back, wings and tail of a female wood grouse (&quot;Tetrao urogallus&quot;). It was later jokingly given the Latin name &quot;Tetrao lepus pseudo-hybridus rarissimus&quot; L.

The term has taken on a general meaning of two disparate elements put together, often conveying a sense of a less fortunate such combination. 

==Name==
The name is a combination of two words, explained by the &quot;Svenska Akademiens ordbok&quot; (Dictionary of the Swedish Academy) as being from the &quot;prefix from (quack or chirp), and the suffix &quot;-der&quot; from (wood grouse)&quot;.

==Origins==
The skvader originates from a tall tale hunting story told by a man named Håkan Dahlmark during a dinner at a restaurant in Sundsvall in the beginning of the 20th century. To the amusement of the other guests, Dahlmark claimed that he in 1874 had shot such an animal during a hunt north of Sundsvall. On his birthday in 1907, his housekeeper jokingly presented him with a painting of the animal, made by her nephew and shortly before his death in 1912, Dahlmark donated the painting to a local museum. During an exhibition in Örnsköldsvik in 1916 the manager of the museum became acquainted with the taxidermist Rudolf Granberg. He then mentioned the hunting story and the painting and asked Granberg if he could re-construct the animal. In 1918 Granberg had completed the skvader and it has since then been a very popular exhibition item at the museum, which also has the painting on display.

==Similar creatures==

A strikingly similar creature called the &quot;rabbit-bird&quot; was described by Pliny the Elder in &quot;Natural History&quot;. This creature had the body of a bird with a rabbit&#x27;s head and was said to have inhabited the Alps.

Other similar creatures include the Bavarian &quot;wolpertinger&quot;, the Austrian &quot;raurakl&quot;, the Thuringian Forest&#x27;s &quot;rasselbock&quot;, the Palatinate&#x27;s &quot;Elwedritsche&quot;, and the American &quot;jackalope&quot;.

==Symbolism==

The skvader has since then often been seen as an unofficial symbol of Sundsvall and when the province Medelpad was to be given a provincial animal (in addition to the provincial flower) in 1987, many locals voted for the skvader. The final choice was a kind of compromise, the mountain hare, which is the front-end of the skvader.

==Other uses==

The term &quot;skvader&quot; can be used colloquially in Swedish to mean &#x27;a combination of contradicting elements&#x27;.

&quot;Skvader&quot; also became the nickname in the 1950s and 1960s for a bruck, a combination of bus and truck (lorry in British English) with the front-end of a bus taking passengers and the back-end as an open loading bay. The &quot;skvader&quot; was used on small bus routes in Norrland and to deliver milk from small farmers to the nearest dairy.

&quot;Skvaderns&quot; is also a herbal liqueur made with herbs from the forest Lunde Skog, the place Skvaderns first were shot at.

<doc id="275210" wikidata="Q1761143" url="?curid=275210" title="Camaragibe">
<text>Camaragibe is a city in the Northeast region of Brazil, in the state of Pernambuco. It lies within the Greater Recife — Brazil&#x27;s 5th-largest metropolitan area. 

Currently, Camaragibe is run by Nadegi Queiroz (from the political party Republicanos) and Délio Junior (The Vice-mayor).

The lands now belonging to the city were used as a reserve of wood, and then for sugar planting. It was populated by natives, until the arrival of Portuguese with Duarte Coelho Pereira, around 1500. After the Portuguese arrival, however, the natives were not completely driven from the area.

In the 16th century, the city (then just an engenho) was considered one of the richest in the region until the Dutch invasion in 1645. At that time, the farm was burned to the ground by the natives. 

On 13 May 1982, Camaragibe, which was then part of the bigger city São Lourenço da Mata, was elevated to the category of city.

The small city is considered among the most densely populated urban areas in the world because of the very accelerated growth that the city experienced from the emancipation until now.

<doc id="275216" wikidata="Q1642137" url="?curid=275216" title="Hemodynamics">
<text>Hemodynamics or haemodynamics are the dynamics of blood flow. The circulatory system is controlled by homeostatic mechanisms of autoregulation, just as hydraulic circuits are controlled by control systems. The hemodynamic response continuously monitors and adjusts to conditions in the body and its environment. Hemodynamics explains the physical laws that govern the flow of blood in the blood vessels.

Blood flow ensures the transportation of nutrients, hormones, metabolic waste products, oxygen, and carbon dioxide throughout the body to maintain cell-level metabolism, the regulation of the pH, osmotic pressure and temperature of the whole body, and the protection from microbial and mechanical harm.

Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid, and is most efficiently studied using rheology rather than hydrodynamics. Because blood vessels are not rigid tubes, classic hydrodynamics and fluids mechanics based on the use of classical viscometers are not capable of explaining haemodynamics.

The study of the blood flow is called hemodynamics, and the study of the properties of the blood flow is called hemorheology.

==Blood==

Blood is a complex liquid. Blood is composed of plasma and formed elements. The plasma contains 91.5% water, 7% proteins and 1.5% other solutes. The formed elements are platelets, white blood cells, and red blood cells. The presence of these formed elements and their interaction with plasma molecules are the main reasons why blood differs so much from ideal Newtonian fluids.

===Viscosity of plasma===
Normal blood plasma behaves like a Newtonian fluid at physiological rates of shear. Typical values for the viscosity of normal human plasma at 37 °C is 1.4 mN·s/m2. The viscosity of normal plasma varies with temperature in the same way as does that of its solvent water;a 3°C change in temperature in the physiological range (36.5°C to 39.5°C)reduces plasma viscosity by about 10%.

===Osmotic pressure of plasma===
The osmotic pressure of solution is determined by the number of particles present and by the temperature. For example, a 1 molar solution of a substance contains molecules per liter of that substance and at 0 °C it has an osmotic pressure of . The osmotic pressure of the plasma affects the mechanics of the circulation in several ways. An alteration of the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane of a blood cell causes a shift of water and a change of cell volume. The changes in shape and flexibility affect the mechanical properties of whole blood. A change in plasma osmotic pressure alters the hematocrit, that is, the volume concentration of red cells in the whole blood by redistributing water between the intravascular and extravascular spaces. This in turn affects the mechanics of the whole blood.

===Red blood cells===
The red blood cell is highly flexible and biconcave in shape. Its membrane has a Young&#x27;s modulus in the region of 106 Pa. Deformation in red blood cells is induced by shear stress. When a suspension is sheared, the red blood cells deform and spin because of the velocity gradient, with the rate of deformation and spin depending on the shear rate and the concentration.
This can influence the mechanics of the circulation and may complicate the measurement of blood viscosity. It is true that in a steady state flow of a viscous fluid through a rigid spherical body immersed in the fluid, where we assume the inertia is negligible in such a flow, it is believed that the downward gravitational force of the particle is balanced by the viscous drag force. From this force balance the speed of fall can be shown to be given by Stokes&#x27; law 

:formula_1
Where &quot;a&quot; is the particle radius, &quot;ρp&quot;, &quot;ρf&quot; are the respectively particle and fluid density &quot;μ&quot; is the fluid viscosity, &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration. From the above equation we can see that the sedimentation velocity of the particle depends on the square of the radius. If the particle is released from rest in the fluid, its sedimentation velocity &quot;Us&quot; increases until it attains the steady value called the terminal velocity (U), as shown above.

===Hemodilution===
Hemodilution is the dilution of the concentration of red blood cells and plasma constituents by partially substituting the blood with colloids or crystalloids. It is a strategy to avoid exposure of patients to the potential hazards of homologous blood transfusions.

Hemodilution can be normovolemic, which implies the dilution of normal blood constituents by the use of expanders. During acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH), blood subsequently lost during surgery contains proportionally fewer red blood cells per milliliter, thus minimizing intraoperative loss of the whole blood. Therefore, blood lost by the patient during surgery is not actually lost by the patient, for this volume is purified and redirected into the patient.

On the other hand, hypervolemic hemodilution (HVH) uses acute preoperative volume expansion without any blood removal. In choosing a fluid, however, it must be assured that when mixed, the remaining blood behaves in the microcirculation as in the original blood fluid, retaining all its properties of viscosity.

In presenting what volume of ANH should be applied one study suggests a mathematical model of ANH which calculates the maximum possible RCM savings using ANH, given the patients weight &quot;Hi&quot; and &quot;Hm&quot;.

To maintain the normovolemia, the withdrawal of autologous blood must be simultaneously replaced by a suitable hemodilute. Ideally, this is achieved by isovolemia exchange transfusion of a plasma substitute with a colloid osmotic pressure (OP). A colloid is a fluid containing particles that are large enough to exert an oncotic pressure across the micro-vascular membrane.
When debating the use of colloid or crystalloid, it is imperative to think about all the components of the starling equation:
:formula_2
To identify the minimum safe hematocrit desirable for a given patient the following equation is useful:
:formula_3
where EBV is the estimated blood volume; 70 mL/kg was used in this model and &quot;Hi&quot; (initial hematocrit) is the patient&#x27;s initial hematocrit.
From the equation above it is clear that the volume of blood removed during the ANH to the &quot;Hm&quot; is the same as the &quot;BLs&quot;.
How much blood is to be removed is usually based on the weight, not the volume. The number of units that need to be removed to hemodilute to the maximum safe hematocrit (ANH) can be found by
:formula_4
This is based on the assumption that each unit removed by hemodilution has a volume of 450 mL (the actual volume of a unit will vary somewhat since completion of collection is dependent on weight and not volume).
The model assumes that the hemodilute value is equal to the &quot;Hm&quot; prior to surgery, therefore, the re-transfusion of blood obtained by hemodilution must begin when SBL begins.
The RCM available for retransfusion after ANH (RCMm) can be calculated from the patient&#x27;s &quot;Hi&quot; and the final hematocrit after hemodilution(&quot;Hm&quot;)
:formula_5
The maximum SBL that is possible when ANH is used without falling below Hm(BLH) is found by assuming that all the blood removed during ANH is returned to the patient at a rate sufficient to maintain the hematocrit at the minimum safe level
:formula_6
If ANH is used as long as SBL does not exceed &quot;BLH&quot; there will not be any need for blood transfusion. We can conclude from the foregoing that &quot;H&quot; should therefore not exceed &quot;s&quot;.
The difference between the &quot;BLH&quot; and the &quot;BLs&quot; therefore is the incremental surgical blood loss (&quot;BLi&quot;) possible when using ANH.
:formula_7
When expressed in terms of the RCM
:formula_8
Where &quot;RCMi&quot; is the red cell mass that would have to be administered using homologous blood to maintain the &quot;Hm&quot; if ANH is not used and blood loss equals BLH.

The model used assumes ANH used for a 70 kg patient with an estimated blood volume of 70 ml/kg (4900 ml). A range of &quot;Hi&quot; and &quot;Hm&quot; was evaluated to understand conditions where hemodilution is necessary to benefit the patient.

====Result====
The result of the model calculations are presented in a table given in the appendix for a range of &quot;Hi&quot; from 0.30 to 0.50 with ANH performed to minimum hematocrits from 0.30 to 0.15. Given a &quot;Hi&quot; of 0.40, if the &quot;Hm&quot; is assumed to be 0.25.then from the equation above the RCM count is still high and ANH is not necessary, if BLs does not exceed 2303 ml, since the hemotocrit will not fall below Hm, although five units of blood must be removed during hemodilution. Under these conditions, to achieve the maximum benefit from the technique if ANH is used, no homologous blood will be required to maintain the &quot;Hm&quot; if blood loss does not exceed 2940 ml. In such a case, ANH can save a maximum of 1.1 packed red blood cell unit equivalent, and homologous blood transfusion is necessary to maintain &quot;Hm&quot;, even if ANH is used.
This model can be used to identify when ANH may be used for a given patient and the degree of ANH necessary to maximize that benefit.

For example, if &quot;Hi&quot; is 0.30 or less it is not possible to save a red cell mass equivalent to two units of homologous PRBC even if the patient is hemodiluted to an &quot;Hm&quot; of 0.15. That is because from the RCM equation the patient RCM falls short from the equation giving above.
If &quot;Hi&quot; is 0.40 one must remove at least 7.5 units of blood during ANH, resulting in an &quot;Hm&quot; of 0.20 to save two units equivalence. Clearly, the greater the &quot;Hi&quot; and the greater the number of units removed during hemodilution, the more effective ANH is for preventing homologous blood transfusion. The model here is designed to allow doctors to determine where ANH may be beneficial for a patient based on their knowledge of the &quot;Hi&quot;, the potential for SBL, and an estimate of the &quot;Hm&quot;. Though the model used a 70 kg patient, the result can be applied to any patient. To apply these result to any body weight, any of the values BLs, BLH and ANHH or PRBC given in the table need to be multiplied by the factor we will call T
:formula_9
Basically, the model considered above is designed to predict the maximum RCM that can save ANH.

In summary, the efficacy of ANH has been described mathematically by means of measurements of surgical blood loss and blood volume flow measurement. This form of analysis permits accurate estimation of the potential efficiency of the techniques and shows the application of measurement in the medical field.

== Blood flow ==
===Cardiac output===
The heart is the driver of the circulatory system, pumping blood through rhythmic contraction and relaxation. The rate of blood flow out of the heart (often expressed in L/min) is known as the cardiac output (CO).

Blood being pumped out of the heart first enters the aorta, the largest artery of the body. It then proceeds to divide into smaller and smaller arteries, then into arterioles, and eventually capillaries, where oxygen transfer occurs. The capillaries connect to venules, and the blood then travels back through the network of veins to the venae cavae into the right heart. The micro-circulation — the arterioles, capillaries, and venules —constitutes most of the area of the vascular system and is the site of the transfer of O2, glucose, and enzyme substrates into the cells. The venous system returns the de-oxygenated blood to the right heart where it is pumped into the lungs to become oxygenated and CO2 and other gaseous wastes exchanged and expelled during breathing. Blood then returns to the left side of the heart where it begins the process again.

In a normal circulatory system, the volume of blood returning to the heart each minute is approximately equal to the volume that is pumped out each minute (the cardiac output). Because of this, the velocity of blood flow across each level of the circulatory system is primarily determined by the total cross-sectional area of that level.

Cardiac output is determined by two methods. One is to use the Fick equation:

formula_10

The other thermodilution method is to sense the temperature change from a liquid injected in the proximal port of a Swan-Ganz to the distal port.

Cardiac output is mathematically expressed by the following equation:

: formula_11
where
* CO = cardiac output (L/sec)
* SV = stroke volume (ml)
* HR = heart rate (bpm)
The normal human cardiac output is 5-6 L/min at rest. Not all blood that enters the left ventricle exits the heart. What is left at the end of diastole (EDV) minus the stroke volume make up the end systolic volume (ESV).

==== Anatomical features ====
Circulatory system of species subjected to orthostatic blood pressure (such as arboreal snakes) has evolved with physiological and morphological features to overcome the circulatory disturbance. For instance, in arboreal snakes the heart is closer to the head, in comparison with aquatic snakes. This facilitates blood perfusion to the brain.

=== Turbulence ===
Blood flow is also affected by the smoothness of the vessels, resulting in either turbulent (chaotic) or laminar (smooth) flow. Smoothness is reduced by the buildup of fatty deposits on the arterial walls.

The Reynolds number (denoted NR or Re) is a relationship that helps determine the behavior of a fluid in a tube, in this case blood in the vessel.

The equation for this dimensionless relationship is written as:
:formula_12
:* &quot;ρ&quot;: density of the blood
:* &quot;v&quot;: mean velocity of the blood
:* &quot;L&quot;: characteristic dimension of the vessel, in this case diameter
:* &quot;μ&quot;: viscosity of blood

The Reynolds number is directly proportional to the velocity and diameter of the tube. Note that NR is directly proportional to the mean velocity as well as the diameter. A Reynolds number of less than 2300 is laminar fluid flow, which is characterized by constant flow motion, whereas a value of over 4000, is represented as turbulent flow. Due to its smaller radius and lowest velocity compared to other vessels, the Reynolds number at the capillaries is very low, resulting in laminar instead of turbulent flow.

===Velocity===
Often expressed in cm/s. This value is inversely related to the total cross-sectional area of the blood vessel and also differs per cross-section, because in normal condition the blood flow has laminar characteristics. For this reason, the blood flow velocity is the fastest in the middle of the vessel and slowest at the vessel wall. In most cases, the mean velocity is used. There are many ways to measure blood flow velocity, like videocapillary microscoping with frame-to-frame analysis, or laser Doppler anemometry.
Blood velocities in arteries are higher during systole than during diastole. One parameter to quantify this difference is the pulsatility index (PI), which is equal to the difference between the peak systolic velocity and the minimum diastolic velocity divided by the mean velocity during the cardiac cycle. This value decreases with distance from the heart.

:formula_13

==Blood vessels==
===Vascular resistance===

Resistance is also related to vessel radius, vessel length, and blood viscosity.

In a first approach based on fluids, as indicated by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation. The equation is as follows:

:formula_14
:* ∆&quot;P&quot;: pressure drop/gradient
:* &quot;μ&quot;: viscosity
:* &quot;l&quot;: length of tube. In the case of vessels with infinitely long lengths, l is replaced with diameter of the vessel.
:* &quot;Q&quot;: flow rate of the blood in the vessel
:* &quot;r&quot;: radius of the vessel

In a second approach, more realistic of the vascular resistance and coming from experimental observations on blood flows, according to Thurston, there is a plasma release-cell layering at the walls surrounding a plugged flow. It is a fluid layer in which at a distance δ, viscosity η is a function of δ written as η(δ), and these surrounding layers do not meet at the vessel centre in real blood flow. Instead, there is the plugged flow which is hyperviscous because holding high concentration of RBCs. Thurston assembled this layer to the flow resistance to describe blood flow by means of a viscosity η(δ) and thickness δ from the wall layer.

The blood resistance law appears as R adapted to blood flow profile :

:formula_15
where
* R = resistance to blood flow
* c = constant coefficient of flow
* L = length of the vessel
* η(δ) = viscosity of blood in the wall plasma release-cell layering
* r = radius of the blood vessel
* δ = distance in the plasma release-cell layer

Blood resistance varies depending on blood viscosity and its plugged flow (or sheath flow since they are complementary across the vessel section) size as well, and on the size of the vessels.
Assuming steady, laminar flow in the vessel, the blood vessels behavior is similar to that of a pipe. For instance if p1 and p2 are pressures are at the ends of the tube, the pressure drop/gradient is:
:formula_16

The larger arteries, including all large enough to see without magnification, are conduits with low vascular resistance (assuming no advanced atherosclerotic changes) with high flow rates that generate only small drops in pressure. The smaller arteries and arterioles have higher resistance, and confer the main blood pressure drop across major arteries to capillaries in the circulatory system.

In the arterioles blood pressure is lower than in the major arteries. This is due to bifurcations, which cause a drop in pressure. The more bifurcations, the higher the total cross-sectional area, therefore the pressure across the surface drops. This is why the arterioles have the highest pressure-drop. The pressure drop of the arterioles is the product of flow rate and resistance: ∆P=Q xresistance. The high resistance observed in the arterioles, which factor largely in the ∆&quot;P&quot; is a result of a smaller radius of about 30 μm. The smaller the radius of a tube, the larger the resistance to fluid flow.

Immediately following the arterioles are the capillaries. Following the logic observed in the arterioles, we expect the blood pressure to be lower in the capillaries compared to the arterioles. Since pressure is a function of force per unit area, (&quot;P&quot; = &quot;F&quot;/&quot;A&quot;), the larger the surface area, the lesser the pressure when an external force acts on it. Though the radii of the capillaries are very small, the network of capillaries has the largest surface area in the vascular network. They are known to have the largest surface area (485 mm^2) in the human vascular network. The larger the total cross-sectional area, the lower the mean velocity as well as the pressure.

Substances called vasoconstrictors can reduce the size of blood vessels, thereby increasing blood pressure. Vasodilators (such as nitroglycerin) increase the size of blood vessels, thereby decreasing arterial pressure.

If the blood viscosity increases (gets thicker), the result is an increase in arterial pressure. Certain medical conditions can change the viscosity of the blood. For instance, anemia (low red blood cell concentration) reduces viscosity, whereas increased red blood cell concentration increases viscosity. It had been thought that aspirin and related &quot;blood thinner&quot; drugs decreased the viscosity of blood, but instead studies found that they act by reducing the tendency of the blood to clot.

To determine the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) the formula for calculating all resistance is used.

formula_17

This translates for SVR into:

formula_18

Where
* SVR = systemic vascular resistance (mmHg/L/min)
* MAP = mean arterial pressure (mmHg)
* CVP = central venous pressure (mmHg)
* CO = cardiac output (L/min)
To get this in Wood units the answer is multiplied by 80.

Normal systemic vascular resistance is between 900 and 1440 dynes/sec/cm−5.

=== Wall tension ===

Regardless of site, blood pressure is related to the wall tension of the vessel according to the Young–Laplace equation (assuming that the thickness of the vessel wall is very small as compared to the diameter of the lumen):
:formula_19
where
* &quot;P&quot; is the blood pressure
* &quot;t&quot; is the wall thickness
* &quot;r&quot; is the inside radius of the cylinder.
* formula_20 is the cylinder stress or &quot;hoop stress&quot;.
For the thin-walled assumption to be valid the vessel must have a wall thickness of no more than about one-tenth (often cited as one twentieth) of its radius.

The cylinder stress, in turn, is the average force exerted circumferentially (perpendicular both to the axis and to the radius of the object) in the cylinder wall, and can be described as:
:formula_21
where:
* &quot;F&quot; is the force exerted circumferentially on an area of the cylinder wall that has the following two lengths as sides:
* &quot;t&quot; is the radial thickness of the cylinder
* &quot;l&quot; is the axial length of the cylinder

===Stress===
When force is applied to a material it starts to deform or move. As the force needed to deform a material (e.g. to make a fluid flow) increases with the size of the surface of the material A., the magnitude of this force F is proportional to the area A of the portion of the surface. Therefore, the quantity (F/A) that is the force per unit area is called the stress. The shear stress at the wall that is associated with blood flow through an artery depends on the artery size and geometry and can range between 0.5 and 4 Pa.
:formula_22.
Under normal conditions, to avoid atherogenesis, thrombosis, smooth muscle proliferation and endothelial apoptosis, shear stress maintains its magnitude and direction within an acceptable range. In some cases occurring due to blood hammer, shear stress reaches larger values. While the direction of the stress may also change by the reverse flow, depending on the hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, this situation can lead to atherosclerosis disease.
=== Capacitance ===

Veins are described as the &quot;capacitance vessels&quot; of the body because over 70% of the blood volume resides in the venous system. Veins are more compliant than arteries and expand to accommodate changing volume.

== Blood pressure ==
The blood pressure in the circulation is principally due to the pumping action of the heart. The pumping action of the heart generates pulsatile blood flow, which is conducted into the arteries, across the micro-circulation and eventually, back via the venous system to the heart. During each heartbeat, systemic arterial blood pressure varies between a maximum (systolic) and a minimum (diastolic) pressure. In physiology, these are often simplified into one value, the mean arterial pressure (MAP), which is calculated as follows:

formula_23

where:
* MAP = Mean Arterial Pressure
* DP = Diastolic blood pressure
* PP = Pulse pressure which is systolic pressure minus diastolic pressure.

Differences in mean blood pressure are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation. The rate of mean blood flow depends on both blood pressure and the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels. Mean blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood moves away from the heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy. Mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation, although most of the fall occurs along the small arteries and arterioles. Gravity affects blood pressure via hydrostatic forces (e.g., during standing), and valves in veins, breathing, and pumping from contraction of skeletal muscles also influence blood pressure in veins.

The relationship between pressure, flow, and resistance is expressed in the following equation:

:formula_24

When applied to the circulatory system, we get:

: formula_25
where
* CO = cardiac output (in L/min)
* MAP = mean arterial pressure (in mmHg), the average pressure of blood as it leaves the heart
* RAP = right atrial pressure (in mmHg), the average pressure of blood as it returns to the heart
* SVR =  systemic vascular resistance (in mmHg * min/L)

A simplified form of this equation assumes right atrial pressure is approximately 0:

:formula_26

The ideal blood pressure in the brachial artery, where standard blood pressure cuffs measure pressure, is &lt;120/80 mmHg. Other major arteries have similar levels of blood pressure recordings indicating very low disparities among major arteries. In the innominate artery, the average reading is 110/70 mmHg, the right subclavian artery averages 120/80 and the abdominal aorta is 110/70 mmHg. The relatively uniform pressure in the arteries indicate that these blood vessels act as a pressure reservoir for fluids that are transported within them.

Pressure drops gradually as blood flows from the major arteries, through the arterioles, the capillaries until blood is pushed up back into the heart via the venules, the veins through the vena cava with the help of the muscles. At any given pressure drop, the flow rate is determined by the resistance to the blood flow. In the arteries, with the absence of diseases, there is very little or no resistance to blood. The vessel diameter is the most principal determinant to control resistance. Compared to other smaller vessels in the body, the artery has a much bigger diameter (4  mm), therefore the resistance is low.

The &quot;arm–leg (blood pressure) gradient&quot; is the difference between the blood pressure measured in the arms and that measured in the legs. It is normally less than 10 mm Hg, but may be increased in e.g. coarctation of the aorta.

==Clinical significance==

===Pressure monitoring===

Hemodynamic monitoring is the observation of hemodynamic parameters over time, such as blood pressure and heart rate. Blood pressure can be monitored either invasively through an inserted blood pressure transducer assembly (providing continuous monitoring), or noninvasively by repeatedly measuring the blood pressure with an inflatable blood pressure cuff.

Hypertension is diagnosed by the presence of arterial blood pressures of 140/90 or greater for two clinical visits.

Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure can show if there is congestive heart failure, mitral and aortic valve disorders, hypervolemia, shunts, or cardiac tamponade.

===Remote, indirect monitoring of blood flow by laser Doppler===

Noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring of eye fundus vessels can be performed by Laser Doppler holography, with near infrared light. The eye offers a unique opportunity for the non-invasive exploration of cardiovascular diseases. Laser Doppler imaging by digital holography can measure blood flow in the retina and choroid, whose Doppler responses exhibit a pulse-shaped profile with time This technique enables non invasive functional microangiography by high-contrast measurement of Doppler responses from endoluminal blood flow profiles in vessels in the posterior segment of the eye. Differences in blood pressure drive the flow of blood throughout the circulation. The rate of mean blood flow depends on both blood pressure and the hemodynamic resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;hemodynamics&quot; () uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; (which comes from the ancient Greek &quot;haima&quot;, meaning blood) and &quot;dynamics&quot;, thus &quot;the dynamics of blood&quot;. The vowel of the &quot;hemo-&quot; syllable is variously written according to the ae/e variation.

<doc id="275221" wikidata="Q11905003" url="?curid=275221" title="Ali (name)">
<text>Ali ( or ; ) is a common unisex (originally male) name. 

Ali is derived from the Arabic triconsonantal root ʕ-l-w, which literally means &quot;high&quot;, &quot;elevated&quot;, &quot;champion&quot;, ”king of kings”, ”emperor”, and is used as both a given name and surname. Islamic traditional use of the name goes back to the Islamic leader Ali ibn Abi Talib, but the name is also present among some pre-Islamic Arabs (e.g. Banu Hanifa, and some rulers of Saba and Himyar). It is identical in form and meaning to the , Eli, which goes back to the High Priest Eli in the biblical Books of Samuel. 

The Ali surname is especially common in Arab countries and the rest of the Muslim world.

Ali is the most common last name in Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Somalia, Kuwait and Libya. The last name can also be found among the Indian Muslim and Pakistani communities, as it is often associated with the descendants of Ali in these regions. 

The name Ali is also used in various other cultures as a given name. Among English speakers it is used as a short form of male or female names starting with &quot;Ali&quot;, such as Alice, Alison, Alisha, Alistair, Alexander, or Alexandra. In Old Norse, Áli and Åle are alternative forms of Onela. Ali is a Finnish male given name, derived from Aleksanteri.

<text>A telephone keypad is a keypad installed on a push-button telephone or similar telecommunication device for dialing a telephone number. It was standardized when the dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) system was developed in the Bell System in the United States in the 1960s – this replaced rotary dialing, that had been developed for electromechanical telephone switching systems. Because of the abundance of rotary dial equipment still on use well into the 1990s, many telephone keypads were also designed to be backwards-compatible: as well as producing DTMF pulses, they could optionally be switched to produce loop-disconnect pulses electronically.

The development of the modern telephone keypad is attributed to research in the 1950s by Richard Deininger under the directorship of John Karlin at the Human Factors Engineering Department of Bell Labs. The modern keypad is laid out in a rectangular array of twelve push buttons arranged as four rows of three keys each. For military applications, a fourth column of keys was added to the right for priority signaling in the Autovon system in the 1960s. Initially, between 1963 and 1968, the keypads for civilian subscriber service omitted the lower left and lower right keys. These two keys are commonly labelled star, , and number sign/hash, , respectively, and produce the signals associated with those symbols. These keys were added to provide signals for anticipated data entry purposes in business applications, but found use in Custom Calling Services (CLASS) features installed in electronic switching systems.

==Layout==
The layout of the digit keys is different from that commonly appearing on calculators and numeric keypads. This layout was chosen after extensive human factors testing at Bell Labs. At the time (late 1950s), mechanical calculators were not widespread, and few people had experience with them. Indeed, calculators were only just starting to settle on a common layout; a 1955 paper states &quot;Of the several calculating devices we have been able to look at ... Two other calculators have keysets resembling [the layout that would become the most common layout] ... . Most other calculators have their keys reading upward in vertical rows of ten.&quot; Meanwhile, a 1960 paper – just five years later – refers to today&#x27;s common calculator layout as &quot;the arrangement frequently found in ten-key adding machines&quot;. In any case, Bell Labs&#x27; testing found that the telephone layout with 1, 2, and 3 on the top row, was slightly faster in use than the calculator layout with them in the bottom row.

The key labeled was officially named the &quot;star&quot; key. The key labeled is officially called the &quot;number sign&quot; key, but other names such as &quot;pound&quot;, &quot;hash&quot;, &quot;hex&quot;, &quot;octothorpe&quot;, &quot;gate&quot;, &quot;lattice&quot;, and &quot;square&quot; are common, depending on national or personal preference. The Greek symbols &quot;alpha&quot; and &quot;omega&quot; had been planned originally.

These can be used for special functions. For example, in the UK, users can order a 7:30am alarm call from a BT telephone exchange by dialing: ✻55✻0730#.

In the Americas and a number of other countries, most dials and, later, keypads also bear letters according to the following system:


In the UK, dials and keypads also bore letters, though these were later dropped. They were arranged as follows:


Putting the letter O on the zero makes sense, as in British speech, &quot;oh&quot; is often said rather than &quot;nought&quot; or &quot;zero&quot;; Q is visually similar to O, and therefore the two might be confused. Therefore, two possible mistakes were avoided.

These letter assignments have been used for multiple purposes. Originally, they referred to the leading letters of telephone exchange names. In the mid-20th century United States, before the switch to All-Number Calling, telephone numbers had seven digits, including a two-digit prefix which was expressed in letters rather than digits, e.g.; KL5-5445. The UK telephone numbering system used a similar two-letter code after an initial zero (the zero prefix selected trunk dialling) to form the first part of the subscriber trunk dialling code for a region; the letters were followed by one or more digits. For example, Aylesbury was assigned 0AY6, which translated to 0296.

The letters have also been used, mainly in the United States, as a technique for remembering telephone numbers easily. For example, an interior decorator might license the telephone number 1-800-724-6837, but advertise it as the more memorable phoneword &quot;1-800-PAINTER&quot;. Sometimes businesses advertise a number with a mnemonic word having more letters than there are digits in the phone number. Usually, this means that the caller just stops dialing at seven digits after the area code or that the extra digits are ignored by the telephone exchange.

In early cell phones, or feature phones, the letters on the keys are used for text entry tasks such as text messaging, entering names in the phone book, and browsing the web. To compensate for the smaller number of keys, phones used multi-tap and later predictive text processing to speed up the process. Touchscreen phones have made these input methods obsolete, as the screens are typically large enough to show as many virtual buttons as necessary for a full keyboard.

==Key tones==
Pressing a single key of a traditional analog telephone keypad produces a telephony signaling event to the remote switching system. For touchtone service, the signal is a dual-tone multi-frequency signaling tone consisting of two simultaneous pure tone sinusoidal frequencies. The row in which the key appears determines the low-frequency component, and the column determines the high-frequency component. For example, pressing key &quot;1&quot; results in a signal composed of tones with frequencies 697 hertz (Hz) and 1209 Hz.

==Letter mapping==

In the course of telephone history, dials as well as keypads have been associated with various mappings of letters and characters to numbers.

The system used in Denmark was different from that used in the UK, which, in turn, was different from the US and Australia. The use of alphanumeric codes for area codes was abandoned in Europe when international direct dialing was introduced in the 1960s, because, for example, dialing VIC 8900 on a Danish telephone would result in a different number to dialling it on a British telephone. At the same time, letters were no longer placed on the dials/keypads of new telephones.

Letters did not reappear on phones in Europe until the introduction of mobile phones, and the layout followed the new international standard ITU E.161/ISO 9995-8. The ITU established an international standard (ITU E.161) in the mid-1990s, recommended that this should be the layout used on any new devices. There is a standard, ETSI ES 202 130, that covers European languages and other languages used in Europe, published by the independent ETSI organisation in 2003 and updated in 2007. Documentation describing some principles of the standard is available.

Early smartphones such as the Palm Treo, HTC Wizard and BlackBerry had full alphanumeric keyboards instead of the traditional telephone keypads, and the user had to execute additional steps to dial a number containing convenience letters. On certain BlackBerry devices, a user can press the key followed by the desired letter, and the device will generate the appropriate DTMF tone.

Later smartphones moved to on-screen virtual keyboards and keypads. The latter typically include the ITU standard letters next to each number (and many Android phone use the key to access voicemail and the zero to type a &quot;+&quot;).

<text>The serval (Leptailurus serval) is a wild cat native to Africa. It is widespread in sub-Saharan countries, where it inhabits grasslands, wetlands, moorlands and bamboo thickets. Across its range, it occurs in protected areas, and hunting it is either prohibited or regulated in range countries.

It is the sole member of the genus Leptailurus. Three subspecies are recognised. The serval is a slender, medium-sized cat that stands tall at the shoulder and has a weight range of approximately . It is characterised by a small head, large ears, a golden-yellow to buff coat spotted and striped with black, and a short, black-tipped tail. The serval has the longest legs of any cat relative to its body size.

The serval is a solitary carnivore and active both by day and at night. It preys on rodents, particularly vlei rats, small birds, frogs, insects, and reptiles, using its sense of hearing to locate prey. It leaps over above the ground to land on the prey on its forefeet, and finally kills it with a bite on the neck or the head. Both sexes establish highly overlapping home ranges of , and mark them with feces and saliva. Mating takes place at different times of the year in different parts of their range, but typically once or twice a year in an area. After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to four is born. The kittens are weaned at the age of one month and begin hunting on their own at six months of age. They leave their mother at the age of around 12 months.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;serval&quot; is derived from &quot;(lobo-) cerval&quot;, i.e. Portuguese for lynx, used by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1765 for a spotted cat that was kept at the time in the Royal Menagerie in Versailles; &quot;lobo-cerval&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;lupus cervarius&quot;, literally and respectively &quot;wolf&quot; and &quot;of or pertaining to deer&quot;.

The name &quot;Leptailurus&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;leptós&quot; meaning &quot;fine, delicate&quot;, and &quot;aílouros&quot; meaning &quot;cat&quot;.

==Taxonomy ==
&quot;Felis serval&quot; was first described by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1776. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the following serval zoological specimens were described:
*&quot;Felis constantina&quot; proposed by Georg Forster in 1780 was a specimen from the vicinity of Constantine, Algeria.
*&quot;Felis servalina&quot; proposed by William Ogilby in 1839 was based on one serval skin from Sierra Leone with freckle-sized spots.
*&quot;Felis brachyura&quot; proposed by Johann Andreas Wagner in 1841 was also a serval skin from Sierra Leone.
*&quot;Felis (Serval) togoensis&quot; proposed by Paul Matschie in 1893 were two skins and three skulls from Togo.
*&quot;Felis servalina pantasticta&quot; and &quot;F. s. liposticta&quot; proposed by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1907 were based on one serval from Entebbe in Uganda with a yellowish fur, and one serval skin from Mombasa in Kenya with dusky spots on its belly.
*&quot;Felis capensis phillipsi&quot; proposed by Glover Morrill Allen in 1914 was a skin and a skeleton of an adult male serval from El Garef at the Blue Nile in Sudan.

The generic name &quot;Leptailurus&quot; was proposed by Nikolai Severtzov in 1858. The serval is the sole member of this genus.

In 1944, Pocock recognised three serval races in North Africa. 
Three subspecies are recognised as valid since 2017:
*&quot;L. s. serval&quot;, the nominate subspecies, in Southern Africa
*&quot;L. s. constantina&quot; in Central and West Africa
*&quot;L. s. lipostictus&quot; in East Africa

=== Phylogeny ===
The phylogenetic relationships of the serval have remained in dispute; in 1997, palaeontologists M. C. McKenna and S. K. Bell classified &quot;Leptailurus&quot; as a subgenus of &quot;Felis&quot;, while others like O. R. P. Bininda-Edmonds (of the Technical University of Munich) have grouped it with &quot;Felis&quot;, &quot;Lynx&quot; and &quot;Caracal&quot;. Studies in the 2000s and the 2010s show that the serval, along with the caracal and the African golden cat, forms one of the eight lineages of Felidae. According to a 2006 genetic study, the &quot;Caracal&quot; lineage came into existence 8.5 million years ago, and the ancestor of this lineage arrived in Africa 8.5–5.6 mya.

The phylogenetic relationships of the serval are as follows:
===Hybrid===

In April 1986, the first savannah cat, a hybrid between a male serval and a female domestic cat, was born; it was larger than a typical domestic kitten and resembled its father in its coat pattern. It appeared to have inherited a few domestic cat traits, such as tameness, from its mother. This cat breed may have a dog-like habit of following its owner about, is adept at jumping and leaping, and can be a good swimmer. Over the years it has gained popularity as a pet.

==Characteristics==

The serval is a slender, medium-sized cat; it stands at the shoulder and weighs , but females tend to be lighter. The head-and-body length is typically between . Males tend to be sturdier than females. Prominent characteristics include the small head, large ears, spotted and striped coat, long legs and a black-tipped tail that is around long. The serval has the longest legs of any cat relative to its body size, largely due to the greatly elongated metatarsal bones in the feet. The toes are elongated as well, and unusually mobile.

The coat is basically golden-yellow to buff and extensively marked with black spots and stripes. The spots show great variation in size. Facial features include the whitish chin, spots, and streaks on the cheeks and the forehead, brownish or greenish eyes, white whiskers on the snout and near the ears, which are black on the back with a white horizontal band in the middle; three to four black stripes run from the back of the head onto the shoulders and then break into rows of spots. The white underbelly has dense and fluffy basal fur, and the soft guard hairs (the layer of fur protecting the basal fur) are long. Guard hairs are up to long on the neck, back and flanks, and are merely long on the face. The serval has a good sense of smell, hearing and vision.

The serval is similar to the sympatric caracal, but has a narrower spoor, a rounder skull, and lacks its prominent ear tufts. The closely set ears can rotate up to 180 degrees independently of each other and help in locating prey efficiently.

Both leucistic and melanistic servals have been observed in captivity. In addition, the melanistic variant has been sighted in the wild, with most melanistic servals having been observed in Kenya.

==Distribution and habitat ==
In North Africa, the serval is known only from Morocco and has been reintroduced in Tunisia, but is feared to be extinct in Algeria. It inhabits semi-arid areas and cork oak forests close to the Mediterranean Sea, but avoids rainforests and arid areas. It occurs in the Sahel, and is widespread in Southern Africa. It inhabits grasslands, moorlands, and bamboo thickets at high altitudes up to on Mount Kilimanjaro. It prefers areas close to water bodies such as wetland and savanna, which provide cover such as reeds and tall grasses. In the East Sudanian Savanna, it was recorded in the transboundary Dinder–Alatash protected area complex during surveys between 2015 and 2018.

In Zambia&#x27;s Luambe National Park, the population density was recorded as in 2011.
In South Africa, the serval was recorded in Free State, eastern Northern Cape, and southern North West.
In Namibia, it is present in Khaudum and Mudumu National Parks.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The serval is active in the day as well as at night; activity might peak in early morning, around twilight, and at midnight. Servals might be active for a longer time on cool or rainy days. During the hot midday, they rest or groom themselves in the shade of bushes and grasses. Servals remain cautious of their vicinity, though they may be less alert when no large carnivores or prey animals are around. Servals walk as much as every night. Servals will often use special trails to reach certain hunting areas. A solitary animal, there is little social interaction among servals except in the mating season, when pairs of opposite sexes may stay together. The only long-lasting bond appears to be of the mother and her cubs, which leave their mother only when they are a year old.

Both males and females establish home ranges, and are most active only in certain regions (&#x27;core areas&#x27;) within them. The area of these ranges can vary from ; prey density, availability of cover and human interference could be significant factors in determining their size. Home ranges might overlap extensively, but occupants show minimal interaction. Aggressive encounters are rare, as servals appear to mutually avoid one another rather than fight and defend their ranges. On occasions where two adult servals meet in conflict over territory, a ritualistic display may ensue, in which one will place a paw on the other&#x27;s chest while observing their rival closely; this interaction rarely escalates into a fight.

Agonistic behavior involves vertical movement of the head (contrary to the horizontal movement observed in other cats), raising the hair and the tail, displaying the teeth and the white band on the ears, and yowling. Individuals mark their ranges and preferred paths by spraying urine on nearby vegetation, dropping scats along the way, and rubbing their mouths on grasses or the ground while releasing saliva. Servals tend to be sedentary, shifting only a few kilometres away even if they leave their range.

The serval is vulnerable to hyenas and African wild dogs. It will seek cover to escape its view, and, if the predator is very close, immediately flee in long leaps, changing its direction frequently and with the tail raised. The serval is an efficient, though not frequent, climber; an individual was observed to have climbed a tree to a height of more than to escape dogs. Like many cats, the serval is able to purr; it also has a high-pitched chirp, and can hiss, cackle, growl, grunt, and meow.

===Hunting and diet===

The serval is a carnivore that preys on rodents, particularly vlei rats, shrews, small birds, hares, frogs, insects, and reptiles, and also feeds on grass that can facilitate digestion or act as an emetic. Up to 90% of the preyed animals weigh less than ; occasionally it also hunts larger prey such as duikers, hares, flamingoes, spoonbills, waterfowl and young antelopes. The percentage of rodents in the diet has been estimated at 80–97%. Apart from vlei rats, other rodents recorded frequently in the diet include the African grass rat, African pygmy mouse and multimammate mice.

The serval locates prey by its strong sense of hearing. It remains motionless for up to 15 minutes; when prey is within range, it jumps with all four feet up to in the air and attacks with its front paws. To kill small prey, it slowly stalks it, then pounces on it with the forefeet directed toward the chest, and finally lands on it with its forelegs outstretched. The prey, receiving a blow from one or both of the serval&#x27;s forepaws, is incapacitated, and the serval bites it on the head or the neck and immediately swallows it. Snakes are dealt more blows and even bites, and may be consumed even as they are moving. Larger prey, such as larger birds, are killed by a sprint followed by a leap to catch them as they are trying to flee, and are eaten slowly. Servals have been observed caching large kills to be consumed later by concealing them in dead leaves and grasses. Servals typically get rid of the internal organs of rodents while eating, and pluck feathers from birds before consuming them. During a leap, a serval can reach more than above the ground and cover a horizontal distance of up to . Servals appear to be efficient hunters; a study in Ngorongoro showed that servals were successful in half of their hunting attempts, regardless of the time of hunting, and a mother serval was found to have a success rate of 62%. The number of kills in a 24-hour period averaged 15 to 16. Scavenging has been observed, but very rarely.

===Reproduction===

Both sexes become sexually mature when they are one to two years old. Oestrus in females lasts one to four days; it typically occurs once or twice a year, though it can occur three or four times a year if the mother loses her litters. Observations of captive servals suggest that when a female enters oestrus, the rate of urine-marking increases in her as well as the males in her vicinity. Zoologist Jonathan Kingdon described the behavior of a female serval in oestrus in his 1997 book &quot;East African Mammals&quot;. He noted that she would roam restlessly, spray urine frequently holding her vibrating tail in a vertical manner, rub her head near the place she has marked, salivate continuously, give out sharp and short &quot;miaow&quot;s that can be heard for quite a distance, and rub her mouth and cheeks against the face of an approaching male. The time when mating takes place varies geographically; births peak in winter in Botswana, and toward the end of the dry season in the Ngorongoro Crater. A trend generally observed across the range is that births precede the breeding season of murid rodents.

Gestation lasts for two to three months, following which a litter of one to four kittens is born. Births take place in secluded areas, for example in dense vegetation or burrows abandoned by aardvarks and porcupines. Blind at birth, newborns weigh nearly and have soft, woolly hair (greyer than in adults) and unclear markings. The eyes open after nine to thirteen days. Weaning begins a month after birth; the mother brings small kills to her kittens and calls out to them as she approaches the &quot;den&quot;. A mother with young kittens rests for a notably lesser time and has to spend almost twice the time and energy for hunting than do other servals. If disturbed, the mother shifts her kittens one by one to a more secure place. Kittens eventually start accompanying their mother to hunts. At around six months, they acquire their permanent canines and begin to hunt themselves; they leave their mother at about 12 months of age. They may reach sexual maturity from 12 to 25 months of age. Life expectancy is about 10 years in the wild and up to 20 years in captivity.

== Conservation ==

The degradation of wetlands and grasslands is a major threat to the survival of the serval. Trade of serval skins, though on the decline, still occurs in countries such as Benin and Senegal. In West Africa, the serval has significance in traditional medicine. Pastoralists often kill servals to protect their livestock, though servals generally do not prey on livestock.

The serval is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List, and is included in CITES Appendix II. It occurs in several protected areas across its range. Hunting of servals is prohibited in Algeria, Botswana, Congo, Kenya, Liberia, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tunisia, and South Africa&#x27;s Cape Province; hunting regulations apply in Angola, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Malawi, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Tanzania, Togo, and Zambia.

==In culture==
The association of servals with human beings dates to the time of Ancient Egypt. Servals are depicted as gifts or traded objects from Nubia in Egyptian art.

Servals are occasionally kept as pets, although their wild nature means that ownership of servals is regulated in some countries. Servals can also be crossed with domestic cats to produce the savannah cat breed.

<doc id="275235" wikidata="Q1401375" url="?curid=275235" title="Yo (greeting)">
<text>Yo is a slang interjection, commonly associated with  North American English. It was popularized by the Italian-American community in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the 1940s.

Although often used as a greeting and often deployed at the beginning of a sentence, &quot;yo&quot; may also come at the end of a sentence and/or may be used to place emphasis on or to direct focus onto a particular individual, group, or issue at hand, or to gain the attention of another individual or group. It may also be used to express excitement, surprise, disbelief, enthusiasm, anger, or amazement.

==Etymology and history==
The interjection &quot;yo&quot; was first used in Middle English. In addition to &quot;yo&quot;, it was also sometimes written &quot;io&quot;.

Though the term may have been in use in an isolated manner in different contexts earlier in English, its current usage and popularity derives from its use in Philadelphia&#x27;s Italian American population in the twentieth century, which spread to other ethnic groups in the city, notably among Philadelphia African Americans, and later spread beyond Philadelphia.

From the late twentieth century, it frequently appeared in hip hop music and became associated with African American Vernacular English.

==Other uses==

* In Baltimore, and possibly other cities, &quot;yo&quot; (or a word coincidentally identical to it) has become a gender-neutral pronoun.
*Among the first times the word was used in mass media, &quot;Yo&quot; was seen in the title &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot;, a popular American television hip-hop music program in the late 1980s.

<doc id="275236" wikidata="Q392409" url="?curid=275236" title="Freediving">
<text>Freediving, free-diving, free diving, breath-hold diving, or skin diving, is a mode of underwater diving that relies on breath-holding until resurfacing rather than the use of breathing apparatus such as scuba gear.

Besides the limits of breath-hold, immersion in water and exposure to high ambient pressure also have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in freediving.

Examples of freediving activities are traditional fishing techniques, competitive and non-competitive freediving, competitive and non-competitive spearfishing and freediving photography, synchronised swimming, underwater football, underwater rugby, underwater hockey, underwater target shooting and snorkeling. There are also a range of &quot;competitive apnea&quot; disciplines; in which competitors attempt to attain great depths, times, or distances on a single breath.

Historically, the term &quot;free diving&quot; was also used to refer to scuba diving, due to the freedom of movement compared with surface supplied diving.

==History==

In ancient times freediving without the aid of mechanical devices was the only possibility, with the exception of the occasional use of reeds and leather breathing bladders. The divers faced the same problems as divers today, such as blacking out during a breath hold. Freediving was practiced in ancient cultures to gather food, harvest resources such as sponge and pearl, reclaim sunken valuables, and to help aid military campaigns.

In Ancient Greece, both Plato and Homer mention the sponge as being used for bathing. The island of Kalymnos was a main centre of diving for sponges. By using weights (skandalopetra) of as much as to speed the descent, breath-holding divers would descend to depths up to to collect sponges. Harvesting of red coral was also done by divers.

The Mediterranean had large amounts of maritime trade. As a result of shipwrecks, particularly in the fierce winter storms, divers were often hired to salvage whatever they could from the seabed. Divers would swim down to the wreck and choose the most valuable pieces to salvage.

Divers were also used in warfare. Defenses against sea vessels were often created, such as underwater barricades, and hence divers were often used to scout out the seabed when ships were approaching an enemy harbor. If barricades were found, it was divers who were used to disassemble them, if possible. During the Peloponnesian War, divers were used to get past enemy blockades to relay messages as well as supplies to allies or troops that were cut off, and in 332 BC, during the Siege of Tyre, the city used divers to cut the anchor cables of Alexander&#x27;s attacking ships.

In Japan, &quot;ama&quot; divers began to collect pearls about 2,000 years ago.
For thousands of years, most seawater pearls were retrieved by divers working in the Indian Ocean, in areas such as the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and in the Gulf of Mannar (between Sri Lanka and India). A fragment of Isidore of Charax&#x27;s Parthian itinerary was preserved in Athenaeus&#x27;s 3rd-century &quot;Sophists at Dinner&quot;, recording freediving for pearls around an island in the Persian Gulf.

Pearl divers near the Philippines were also successful at harvesting large pearls, especially in the Sulu Archipelago. At times, the largest pearls belonged by law to the sultan, and selling them could result in the death penalty for the seller. Nonetheless, many pearls made it out of the archipelago by stealth, ending up in the possession of the wealthiest families in Europe. Pearling was popular in Qatar, Bahrain, Japan, and India. The Gulf of Mexico was also known for pearling.
Native Americans harvested freshwater pearls from lakes and rivers like the Ohio, Tennessee, and Mississippi, while others dived for marine pearls from the Caribbean and waters along the coasts of Central and South America.

In 1940, Dottie Frazier pioneered freediving for women in the United States and also began teaching classes. It was also during this time that she began to design and sell rubber suits for Navy UDT divers.

==Freediving activities==

=== Recreational hunting and gathering ===

====Spearfishing====

Spearfishing is an ancient method of fishing that has been used throughout the world for millennia. Early civilizations were familiar with the custom of spearing fish from rivers and streams using sharpened sticks.

Today modern spearfishing makes use of elastic powered spearguns and slings, or compressed gas pneumatic powered spearguns, to strike the hunted fish. Specialised techniques and equipment have been developed for various types of aquatic environments and target fish. Spearfishing may be done using free-diving, snorkelling, or scuba diving techniques. Spearfishing while using scuba equipment is illegal in some countries. The use of mechanically powered spearguns is also outlawed in some countries and jurisdictions. Spearfishing is highly selective, normally uses no bait and has limited by-catch.

====Collection of shellfish====
Various cultures have collected shellfish by freediving for &quot;possibly thousands&quot; of years. One example is the historical recreational collection of abalone in South Africa, before illegal harvesting reduced stocks to levels which resulted in recreational collection being banned indefinitely. This did not completely stop illegal harvesting, because selling illegally harvested abalone remained lucrative.

===Competitive breath-hold watersports===

====Aquathlon====
Aquathlon (also known as underwater wrestling) is an underwater sport where two competitors wearing masks and fins wrestle underwater in an attempt to remove a ribbon from each other&#x27;s ankle band in order to win the bout. The &quot;combat&quot; takes place in a 5-metre (16 ft) square ring within a swimming pool, and is made up of three 30-second rounds, with a fourth round played in the event of a tie. The sport originated during the 1980s in the former USSR (now Russia) and was first played at international level in 1993. It was recognised by the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS) in 2008.

====Competitive spearfishing====
Competitive spearfishing is defined by the world governing body CMAS as &quot;the hunting and capture of fish underwater without the aid of artificial breathing devices, using gear that depends entirely on the physical strength of the competitor.&quot; They publish a set of competition rules that are used by affiliated organisations.

====Synchronised swimming====

Synchronized swimming is a hybrid form of swimming, dance, and gymnastics, consisting of swimmers (either solos, duets, trios, combos, or teams) performing a synchronized routine of elaborate moves in the water, accompanied by music. Synchronized swimming demands advanced water skills, and requires great strength, endurance, flexibility, grace, artistry and precise timing, as well as exceptional breath control when upside down underwater. During lifts swimmers are not allowed to touch the bottom.

Traditionally it was a women&#x27;s sport, but following the addition of a new mixed-pair event, FINA World Aquatics competitions are open to men since the 16th 2015 championships in Kazan, and the other international and national competitions allow male competitors in every event. However, men are currently still barred from competing in the Olympics. Both USA Synchro and Synchro Canada allow men to compete with women. Most European countries also allow men to compete, and France even allows male only podiums, according to the number of participants. In the past decade, more men are becoming involved in the sport and a global biannual competition called Men&#x27;s Cup has been steadily growing.

Swimmers perform two routines for the judges, one technical and one free, as well as age group routines and figures. Synchronized swimming is both an individual and team sport. Swimmers compete individually during figures, and then as a team during the routine. Figures are made up of a combination of skills and positions that often require control, strength, and flexibility. Swimmers are ranked individually for this part of the competition. The routine involves teamwork and synchronization. It is choreographed to music and often has a theme. Synchronized swimming is governed internationally by FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation).

====Underwater hockey====

Underwater hockey (also called octopush, mainly in the United Kingdom) is a globally played limited-contact sport in which two teams compete to manoeuvre a hockey puck across the bottom of a swimming pool into the opposing team&#x27;s goal by propelling it with a hockey stick. The sport originated in England in 1954 when Alan Blake, the founder of the newly formed Southsea Sub-Aqua Club, invented the game he called octopush to keep the club&#x27;s members interested and active during the cold winter months, when open-water diving lost its appeal. Underwater hockey is now played worldwide, governed by the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS). The first Underwater Hockey World Championship was held in Canada in 1980, after a planned championship in 1979 was scuttled by international politics and apartheid.

====Underwater football====

Underwater football is a two-team underwater sport that shares common elements with underwater hockey and underwater rugby. As with both of those games, it is played in a swimming pool with snorkeling equipment (mask, snorkel, and fins). The goal of the game is to (by carrying and passing) a slightly negatively buoyant ball from one side of a pool to the other by players who are completely submerged underwater. Scoring is achieved by placing the ball (under control) in the on the side of the pool. Variations include using a toy rubber torpedo as the ball, and weighing down buckets to rest on the bottom and serve as goals.

It is played in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Saskatchewan.

====Underwater rugby====
Underwater rugby is an underwater team sport. During a match, two teams try to score a negatively buoyant ball (filled with saltwater) into the opponents’ goal at the bottom of a swimming pool. It originated from within the physical fitness training regime existing in German diving clubs during the early 1960s and has little in common with rugby football except for the name. It was recognised by the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS) in 1978 and was first played as a world championship in 1980.

====Underwater target shooting====
Underwater target shooting is an underwater sport that tests a competitors’ ability to accurately use a speargun via a set of individual and team events conducted in a swimming pool using free diving or apnea technique. The sport was developed in France during the early 1980s and is currently practised mainly in Europe. It is known as &quot;Tir sur cible subaquatique&quot; in French and as &quot;Tiro al Blanco Subacuático&quot; in Spanish.

==Competitive apnea==
Competitive freediving is currently governed by two world associations: AIDA International and Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS). Historically, there were two more organisations that regulated freediving records and activities — International Association of Freedivers (IAFD) and Freediving Regulations and Education Entity (FREE). Each organization has its own rules on recognizing a record attempt which can be found on the organization&#x27;s website. Alongside competitive disciplines, there are record disciplines — disciplines that are not held in competitions, that are just for setting world records. There is a third organization, Guinness, which in addition to AIDA and CMAS presides over record disciplines.

Almost all types of competitive freediving are individual sports based on the best individual achievement. Exceptions to this rule are the bi-annual AIDA Team World Championship, where the combined score of the team members makes up the team&#x27;s total points, and Skandalopetra diving competitions held by CMAS, the only truly ‘team’ event in freediving for which teams are formed by two athletes: one acting as the diver () and the other acting as an assistant ().

=== Disciplines ===
There are currently eleven recognized disciplines defined by AIDA and CMAS, and a dozen more that are only practiced locally. All disciplines can be practiced by both men and women, and only CMAS currently separates records in fresh water from those at sea. The disciplines of AIDA can be done both in competition and as a record attempt, with the exception of variable weight and no limits, which are both solely for record attempts. For all AIDA depth disciplines, the depth the athlete will attempt is announced before the dive; this is accepted practice for both competition and record attempts. Most divers choose monofin (MF) over bifins (BF) where there is a choice.


;Overview of the above disciplines
===Competition safety===
Following the deaths of two freedivers in competitions, AIDA has a system set up for monitoring and if necessary, recovering competitors who lose consciousness underwater.
As of 2022 the incidence of adverse events in depth competitions varies between 3 and 4%. This rate is considered relatively low and is expected during competitions where divers push their breath-hold limits. Almost all of these divers are successfully assisted and recover completely. There is a much lower incidence of more serious injuries.

====Safety divers====

The safety team is usually made up of volunteers, or paid staff in some major events, and is supervised by the . Each competitor is monitored by a team of breath-hold safety divers who will descend in time to meet the competitor during their ascent, and monitor them for the rest of the ascent. They will intervene if necessary, typically by securing the competitor&#x27;s airway and swimming them up to the surface. The first safety diver will meet the competitor at somewhere around 1/3 to 1/4 of the target depth, usually with a maximum of 30m. The second will meet them about 10m shallower, and a third will be on standby in case of an emergency. The work can be challenging as many dives are done in a day, so the team of safety divers is usually rotated to ensure that they are not overtasked.

In case of a deeper incident, the competitor is clipped to the downline for the duration of the dive, which can be rapidly raised by the surface support team, which includes a medical support group.

===World records===
The best official result in static apnea is the Guinness WR of 11:54 by Branko Petrović in 2014, a freediver who has results over 10 minutes under both AIDA and CMAS.
The best no limits result is 253.2m by Herbert Nitsch in 2012; his intention of having the dive sanctioned by AIDA fell through due to a sponsoring conflict.
After 2001, AIDA International no longer separated the records achieved in fresh water from those in the sea.

====CMAS recognized world records====
, the CMAS recognized world records are:

The AIDA recognized world records are:


====Guinness recognized world records====
The following table only includes those disciplines that are modifications of existing AIDA or CMAS disciplines and Guinness-exclusive (as it recognizes and inherits some AIDA/CMAS records) or Guinness-conceived (CMAS and AIDA do/did sanction at some time) disciplines.


==Recreational==

Freediving as a recreational activity is widely practiced and differs significantly from scuba diving. Although there are potential risks to all freediving, it can be safely practiced using a wide range of skill levels from the average snorkeler to the professional freediver. Compared to scuba diving, freediving offers:

* Freedom from cumbersome equipment and short preparation times.
* Low cost.
* It is quiet and does not disturb fish, the noise of breathing and bubbles can be quite loud on open circuit scuba though rebreathers are much quieter. 
* Mobility and speed, but for a much more limited period.
* No decompression time for deep dives, although it is possible to get decompression sickness, or taravana, from repetitive deep free-diving with short surface intervals.
* The lack of exhaled air bubbles on ascent gives greater visibility on ascent.
* Accessibility, if the site can be walked to it can, potentially, be dived.
* Appropriately skilled and fit freedivers can go as deep, or deeper than, recreational scuba divers, the depth being limited only by the willingness to accept the risks; scuba diving is restricted by the level of certification.

Freshwater springs, often with excellent visibility, provide good freediving opportunities but with greater risks. Diving into spring caverns with restricted access to the surface is very different from diving in open water. The time available to a freediver to solve problems underwater before hypoxia sets in is severely restricted in comparison with scuba. Freediving into confined cave systems such as Eagle&#x27;s Nest Cave, Florida and Blue Springs State Park, Florida has resulted in several deaths. Cave freediving is commonly discouraged in basic freediver safety training.

==Physiology==

=== General adaptations ===
The human body has several oxygen-conserving adaptations that manifest under diving conditions as part of the mammalian diving reflex. The adaptations include:
*Reflex bradycardia: Significant drop in heart rate.
*Blood-shift: Blood flow and volume is redistributed towards vital organs by means of a reflex vasoconstriction. Blood vessels distend and become engorged, which in the case of the pulmonary capillaries assists with pressure compensation that comes with increasing diving depth, and without which a largely air-filled chest cavity would simply collapse for lack of compliance.
* Body-cooling: peripheral vasoconstriction results in cooling of peripheral tissue beds, which lower their oxygen demand in a thermodynamic manner. In addition, Murat et al. (2013) recently discovered that breath-holding results in prompt and substantial brain cooling, just like in diving birds and seals. (Dry) breath-holds result in cooling on the order of about 1 °C/minute, but this is likely to be greater with cold water submersion, in proportion to the magnitude and promptness of the dive response.
*Splenic contraction: Releasing red blood cells carrying oxygen.

=== Recent human evolution ===
In addition to general adaptations within the human species, freediving is an example of an activity that has been directly affected by recent human evolution. The Bajau, or “Sea Nomads,” have engaged in freediving for thousands of years, and natural selection has led to larger spleen sizes. This serves as an oxygen reservoir when diving. It is hypothesized that other isolated diving populations globally may have experienced the same selection.

==Techniques==

Breath-holding ability, and hence dive performance, is a function of on-board oxygen stores, scope for metabolic rate reduction, efficient oxygen utilization, and hypoxia tolerance. Athletes attempt to accomplish this in various ways. Some divers use &quot;packing&quot;, which increases lung volume beyond normal total lung capacity. In addition, training is allocated to enhance blood and muscle oxygen stores, to a limited extent.
Most divers rely on increasing fitness by increasing tolerance and lung capacity. Simple breath-holding practice is highly effective for the build-up of tolerance to CO2 and to some degree increased lung capacity. In an interview on the radio talk show Fresh Air, journalist James Nestor, author of the book &quot;&quot;, stated: &quot;Some divers have a lung capacity of 14 liters, which is about double the size for a typical adult male. They weren&#x27;t born this way. ... They trained themselves to breathe in ways to profoundly affect their physical bodies.&quot;
===Ascent===

== Certification ==
There is no requirement by law that free-divers are required to do formal freediving training or be certified, but due to the risks inherent to the sport, freediving without training poses a significant risk to life. The free-diving courses contain three components: theory studies, confined water sessions generally conducted in a swimming pool, and open water sessions in the ocean or other large body of fresh or salt water. 
==Training==

Training for freediving can take many forms, some of which can be performed on land. One training exercise is the apnea walk. This consists of a preparation &quot;breathe-up&quot;, followed by a short (typically 1 minute) breath hold taken at rest. Without breaking the hold, participants then begin walking as far as possible until it becomes necessary to breathe again. Some athletes can do close to 400 meters in training this way.

This form of training is good for accustoming muscles to work under anaerobic conditions, and for tolerance to carbon dioxide build-up in the circulation. It is also easy to gauge progress, as increasing distance can be measured.

Before competition attempts, freedivers perform a preparation sequence, which usually consists of physical stretching, mental exercise and breath exercise. It may include a succession of variable length static apnea and special purging deep breaths. Results of the preparation sequence are slower metabolism, lower heart and breathing rates, lower levels of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, and overall mental equilibrium.

The University of Miami presents a scientific freediving class that was developed by Claire Paris, a marine scientist and freediver, the class is the first of its kind at the university.

==Safety==
===Hazards===
The most obvious hazard is lack of access to air for breathing – a necessity for human life. This can result in asphyxia from drowning if the diver does not reach the surface while still capable of holding their breath and resuming breathing. The risk depends on several factors, including the depth, duration and shape of the dive profile.

Latent hypoxia is a specific hazard of deeper freedives. This effect can cause hypoxic blackout during surfacing.

There is also a wide range of environmental hazards possible specific to the site and water and weather conditions at the time of diving, and there may be other hazards specific to the freediving activity.
===Risk===

Failing to respond to physiological warning signals, or crossing the mental barrier by strong will, may lead to blackout underwater or on reaching the surface. Trained freedivers are well aware of this and competitions must be held under strict supervision and with competent first-aiders on standby. However, this does not eliminate the risk of blackout. Freedivers are encouraged by certification and sporting organisations to dive only with a &#x27;buddy&#x27; who accompanies them, observing from in the water at the surface, and ready to dive to the rescue if the diver loses consciousness during the ascent. This is only reasonably practicable if the water clarity allows observation, and the buddy is capable of safely reaching the diver. Due to the nature of the sport, the risks of freediving can be reduced by strict adherence to safety measures as an integral part of the activity, but cannot be eliminated. Competition rules may require all participants to be adept in rescue and resuscitation.

===Statistics and notable accidents===

Nicholas Mevoli, a diver from New York died on 17 November 2013 after losing consciousness on surfacing from a 3-minute 38 second dive to a depth of during an official record attempt in the &quot;constant weight without fins&quot; event. He had previously reached greater depths and longer times in other disciplines.
==Fiction and documentaries==

<text>Tipton is an industrial town in the metropolitan borough of Sandwell, in the county of the West Midlands, England. It had a population of 38,777 at the 2011 UK Census. It is located northwest of Birmingham and southeast of Wolverhampton. It is also contiguous with nearby towns of Darlaston, Dudley, Wednesbury and Bilston.

Historically within Staffordshire and briefly Worcestershire. It is located between both Wolverhampton and Birmingham. It incorporates the surrounding villages and suburbs of Tipton Green, Ocker Hill, Dudley Port, Horseley Heath and Great Bridge.

Tipton was an urban district until 1938, when it became a municipal borough. Much of the Borough of Tipton was transferred into West Bromwich County Borough in 1966, but parts of the old borough were absorbed into an expanded Dudley borough and the newly created County Borough of Warley. Along with the rest of West Bromwich and Warley, Tipton was moved into the Sandwell Metropolitan Borough in 1974.

==Etymology==
Tipton gains its name from the Anglo-Saxon name &#x27;Tibba&#x27; followed by &#x27;tun&#x27;, the Old English word for farm or settlement. The town of Tipton was recorded as &quot;Tibintone&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, meaning Tibba&#x27;s estate. The present spelling of Tipton derives from the 16th century.

==History==

Until the 18th century, Tipton was a collection of small hamlets. Industrial growth started in the town when ironstone and coal were discovered in the 1770s. A number of canals were built through the town and later railways, which greatly accelerated its industrialisation.

James Watt built his first steam engine in Tipton in the 1770s, which was used to pump water from the mines. In 1780, James Keir and Alexander Blair set up a chemical works there, making alkali and soap on a large scale.

The 1801 census records 834 houses with 872 families living in Tipton: 46 houses were stated as being empty. An adult population of 4,280 is recorded with males numbered at 2,218 and slightly fewer females at 2,062. Iron making and mining were the main employment for the population. Trades and manufacturing provided work for 1,740 people and other jobs totalled 2,484. Between Tipton and Dudley there were a few farms listed, which gave employment to 56 people.

Expansion in the iron and coal industries led to the population of Tipton expanding rapidly through the 19th century, going from 4,000 at the beginning of the century to 30,000 at the end. Tipton gained a reputation as being &quot;the quintessence of the Black Country&quot; because chimneys of local factories belched heavy pollution into the air, whilst houses and factories were built side by side. Most of the traditional industries which once dominated the town have since disappeared.

In March 1922, 19 girls - as young as 13 - and young women were killed in an explosion at an unlicensed factory that was dismantling surplus World War I ammunition, in an event dubbed the Tipton Catastrophe.
The Black Country Living Museum in nearby Dudley re-creates life in the early 20th century Black Country, in original buildings which have been rebuilt and furnished, many of them being transported from – or based on – sites originally located in Tipton. There is a residential canal basin at the museum, reflecting Tipton&#x27;s former status in popular local culture as the &quot;Venice of the Midlands&quot;. Some of the town&#x27;s canals were infilled during the 1960s and 1970s. The towpaths of the remaining canals, the Old and New BCN Main Lines are today a cycling, wildlife and leisure facility.

The landscape of Tipton began to change further from the late 1920s when new housing estates were built by the town&#x27;s council, in response to the growing need to replace slum housing. Among the first council estates to be built were the Shrubbery Estate at Tipton Green, the Tibbington Estate near Princes End, (Princes End came under Coseley at the time) the Moat Farm Estate at Ocker Hill (which earned the nickname &quot;Lost City&quot; due to its isolated location) and the Cotterill&#x27;s Farm Estate at Ocker Hill, the Glebefields Estate at Ocker Hill and Great Bridge. Private houses were also built on smaller developments around the same time. The &quot;Lost City&quot; was integrated with the rest of Tipton as further housing developments sprang up around it namely The Glebefields Estate and The Gospel Oak Estate.

During the Second World War (1939–1945), there were a number of air raids on the town. On 19 November 1940, three people were killed by a Luftwaffe bomb which was dropped in Bloomfield Road and destroyed several buildings including the Star public house; it was rebuilt after the war but demolished in 1996. Just before Christmas in 1940, an anti-aircraft shell fired from the hills at Rowley Regis fell down the chimney of the Boat Inn, Dudley Road East, Tividale; fatally injuring 12 people at a wedding reception (including the bride, while the groom lost both legs) as well as the resident of an adjacent house. On 17 May 1941, six people died in an air raid in New Road, Great Bridge. Tipton Tavern and New Road Methodist Church were destroyed and a number of nearby houses were damaged. Tipton Tavern landlord Roger Preece was trapped in the rubble but survived with minor injuries.

Tipton Tavern was rebuilt in the 1950s and became the Hallbridge Arms during the 1990s and, more recently, the Pearl Girl, the world&#x27;s first licensed pearl bar. It closed in 2016 and has since been converted into a day nursery for young children.

The last major council housing development by Tipton council was the Glebefields Estate part of Ocker Hill and not Princes End as many suggest, due to Princes End not being part of Tipton at this time, and built during the first half of the 1960s. A stretch of the Wednesbury Oak Loop Canal was filled in to make way for it. The last major private housing development to be built in the Municipal Borough of Tipton was the Foxyards Estate, on land straddling the borders with Dudley and Coseley, in the mid 1960s.

Until 1966, the town had its own council. The urban district council of Tipton was formed in 1894 contained only the civil parish of Tipton, then received Municipal Borough status in 1938. The headquarters were originally based in a 19th-century building on Owen Street until 1935 when it relocated to the former Bean offices site on Sedgley Road West, straddling the border with Coseley. The council remained at that site for the next 31 years, until the dissolution of the borough council. On 1 April 1966 the district was abolished and the bulk of the Tipton borough was absorbed into an expanded County Borough of West Bromwich, although a fragment of the town near the border with Coseley (including the former council offices and the bulk of the new Foxyards housing estate) was absorbed into the County Borough of Dudley and most of the Tividale area became part of the new County Borough of Warley. In this reorganisation, the township of Tipton was expanded around Princes End to take over a section of the former Coseley urban district. The parish was also abolished on 1 April 1966 and merged with West Bromwich and Dudley, part also went to form Warley. In 1961 the parish had a population of 38,100. The headquarters building was later taken over by Dudley College, who retained it until 1993. It has since been occupied by businesses and training scheme providers.

Since 1974, Tipton has been split between the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell, which was created by a merger of the former West Bromwich and Warley boroughs, and the neighbouring Metropolitan Borough of Dudley.

By the end of the 1970s, most of the housing in Tipton built before 1890 had been demolished. Owen Street, the town&#x27;s main shopping area, was redeveloped between 1979 and 1982, with a reduced number of shop units as well as new low-rise council houses and flats.

In 1956, one of Britain&#x27;s first comprehensive schools, Tividale Comprehensive School, was opened in Tipton near the border with Oldbury, in the area which became part of Warley a decade later and was not included in the modern Tipton DY4 postal district.

Tipton&#x27;s first gasworks was opened in 1958 and redeveloped as a state-of-the-art Naphta Gas plant by 1965, but owing to the emergence of North Sea gas, the gasworks closed in 1975 and stood empty for a decade before demolition. The site of the gas plant was redeveloped as the Standbridge Park housing estates in the 1990s.
Tipton has two railway stations, the main railway station at Owen Street and another station at Dudley Port. There were several other stations in the town on three different railway lines, but these were gradually closed between 1916 and 1964 as passenger trains were phased out on these lines. The Dudley-Wolverhampton railway line, which straddled Tipton&#x27;s border with Coseley, closed in 1968. The Princes End Branch Line, which was only two miles long, closed in 1981. The South Staffordshire Line through Tipton, which led to Walsall northwards and Dudley southwards, closed in 1993. The part of the line between Wednesbury and Brierley Hill is scheduled to re-open in 2023 as a part of Midland Metro line 2.

Most of the archive collection for Tipton is held at Sandwell Community History and Archives Service, although some items have been retained by the town&#x27;s library.

==Local industry==

Tipton was one of the key towns in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. Even during the 18th century it had established its first key industries. This included the world&#x27;s first successful steam pumping engine, which was erected at Conygre Coalworks in 1712 by industrialist Thomas Newcomen. A full-size replica of the engine now exists at the Black Country Living Museum just over Tipton&#x27;s borders in Dudley.

In 1800, Tipton was a predominantly rural area, with a few coal mines and some 4,000 residents. Mass building of factories and digging of coal mines then took place, and resulted in Tipton becoming a heavily built-up and industrialised area with more than 30,000 residents by the end of the 19th century. The town&#x27;s population grew further in the 20th century after new housing developments, mostly by the local council but with a significant number in the private sector. Local industry also expanded further during this time.

In 1840, the Batson family established a lubricant blending plant to serve the local industries at the junction of High Street and Dudley Road. The site is still operational today, owned by German refiner H&amp;R AG, although the original buildings have long since been replaced.

Coal mining had disappeared from Tipton by the mid-20th century, and the town lost a large percentage of its factories during the recessions of the 1970s and 1980s, which contributed to a rise in unemployment and poverty in Tipton, while living conditions continued to improve.

Bean Cars, a company that manufactured cars and lorry engines and other vehicle parts, had a factory in Tipton. Further industrial sites have been abandoned since the 1970s, paving the way for mass private house building on the land. The town&#x27;s naphtha gas plant opened in 1965 but closed just 10 years later, unable to compete with natural gas from the North Sea. The gasworks stood abandoned for about a decade afterwards, when it was finally demolished. Standeridge Park housing estate was built on its site during the 1990s. By the late 2000s, most of the town&#x27;s large factories had closed.

==Transport==
The M5 motorway between the West Midlands and the West Country and its junction with the M6 motorway passes a few miles to the South and East of the town but not through the town itself. The M5 runs along the eastern region passing over canals and railways. M5 Junction 1 is accessible at West Bromwich using the A41 road Black Country Spine Road. M5 Junction 2 is accessible at Oldbury on the A4123 Wolverhampton Road (Harborne to Wolverhampton) at Birchley Island. The M5 also enables access to other motorways.

===Buses===
Tipton Town Centre has direct bus links with the towns of Dudley, Sedgley, West Bromwich and Bilston on Diamond Bus services 42 and 229. Additionally, Princes End and Gospel Oak have service 11/11A to Walsall and Wednesbury, and service 43 to Bilston. These are operated by National Express West Midlands.

===Railways===
Tipton has direct, frequent rail services to Wolverhampton and Walsall via Birmingham New Street with some additional services during evening rush hour direct to Telford and Shrewsbury. There are two railway stations - Tipton in the town centre and Dudley Port. Both are on the electrified line from Birmingham New Street to Wolverhampton which is a section of the West Coast Main Line.

====South Staffordshire Line====
Closed lines include that from Walsall to Stourbridge, closed to all traffic in 1993 after some 150 years in use. This line had served stations at Dudley Port Lower Level and Great Bridge North, but both were closed in 1964 by the Beeching cuts. The line is set to re-open around 2023, with the lines shared between goods trains and the West Midlands Metro.

In October 2015, it was announced that due to high transport funding for the West Midlands, the Stourbridge to Walsall line could re-open as a Network Rail operated line served by West Midlands franchise services and the delivery date was 2018-2020, however this did not occur. Instead, the line will partially reopen operated by the West Midlands Metro as its second line, running between Wednesbury and Brierley Hill. Services are anticipated to start in 2023 and the stations within the Tipton boundaries will be Great Bridge, Horseley Heath, Dudley Port (Low Level), Sedgley Road East and Birmingham New Road.

====Other closed lines====
The line between Great Bridge and Swan Village in nearby West Bromwich was closed in 1968 under the Beeching cuts, and most of its route was occupied by the southern section of the Black Country Spine Road, completed in 1995.

The line between Princes End and Ocker Hill closed to passenger trains in 1916 but remained open to goods traffic until 1981. The closure of the railway was followed by the construction of a pedestrian walkway on the trackbed, while the tunnel under the road at Ocker Hill was filled in. The final stub of the line, which linked Wednesbury with Ocker Hill Power Station, was closed in 1991.

The Dudley-Wolverhampton railway closed in 1968, several years after passenger trains were withdrawn, and by the 1990s some sections of it had been built over, making it impossible to reopen this route at any stage. The former Tipton Five Ways and Princes End &amp; Coseley stations were redeveloped for housing and road access. A bridge abundment that carried the line in and out of Tipton Five Ways another on the Birmingham New Road near the Black Country Museum are some of the last remaining signs of this railway in Tipton.

==Sport==
Tipton Town Football Club were formed in 1948 as Ocker Hill United, adopting their current name in 1967. They currently play in the non-league West Midland league division one and made history in the 2010-11 football season by reaching the FA Cup first round proper for the first time in their history, earning a trip to Carlisle United, the League One (third highest English division) club. They were the first club that Steve Bull played for; he joined them on leaving school in 1981 and remained with them until he signed for West Bromwich Albion, a top division club, in 1985. However, it was after signing for Wolverhampton Wanderers in November 1986 that Bull achieved fame; by the time he retired in 1999, he had scored more than 300 goals for the club. He was also capped 13 times by the England national football team between May 1989 and October 1990, scoring four goals.

The Sandwell Steelers who are an American Football team who play in the BAFA National Leagues operate from the Tipton Sports Academy.

<text>The First Succession Act (25 Hen. 8. c. 22) of Henry VIII&#x27;s reign was passed by the Parliament of England in March 1534. The Act was formally titled the Succession to the Crown Act 1533, or the Act of Succession 1533; it is often dated as 1534, as it was passed in that calendar year. However, the legal calendar in use at that time dated the beginning of the year as March 25, and so considered the Act as being in 1533.

==Provisions==
The Act made Elizabeth, daughter of Henry VIII by Anne Boleyn, who had been born on 7 September 1533, the heir presumptive to the Crown by declaring Mary, daughter of Henry VIII by Catherine of Aragon, a bastard. The Act also required all subjects, if commanded, to swear an oath to recognize this Act as well as the king&#x27;s supremacy. Under the Treasons Act 1534 anyone who refused to take the oath was subject to a charge of treason.

The Act was later altered by the Second Succession Act, which made Elizabeth illegitimate, and the Third Succession Act, which returned both Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession.

<doc id="275247" wikidata="Q187909" url="?curid=275247" title="Agora">
<text>The agora (; , &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;market&quot; in Modern Greek) was a central public space in ancient Greek city-states. The literal meaning of the word &quot;agora&quot; is &quot;gathering place&quot; or &quot;assembly&quot;. The agora was the center of the athletic, artistic, business, social, spiritual, and political life in the city. The Ancient Agora of Athens is the best-known example.

==Origins==

Early in Greek history (10th–4th centuries BC), free-born citizens would gather in the agora for military duty or to hear statements of the ruling king or council. Later, the agora also served as a marketplace, where merchants kept stalls or shops to sell their goods amid arcades. This attracted artisans who built workshops nearby.

From these twin functions of the agora as a political and a commercial spot came the two Greek verbs , &quot;agorázō&quot;, &quot;I shop&quot;, and , &quot;agoreúō&quot;, &quot;I speak in public&quot;.

==Ancient Agora of Athens==
The Ancient Agora of Athens was situated beneath the northern slope of the Acropolis. The Ancient Agora was the primary meeting ground for Athenians, where members of democracy congregated affairs of the state, where business was conducted, a place to hang out, and watch performers and listen to famous philosophers. The importance of the Athenian agora revolved around religion. The agora was a very sacred place, in which holiness is laid out in the architecture of the ground upon which it lay. The layout of the agora was centered around the Panathenaic Way, a road that ran through the middle of Athens and to the main gate of the city, Dipylon. This road was considered tremendously sacred, serving as a travel route for the Panathenaic festival, which was held in honor of the goddess Athena every four years. The agora was also famously known for housing the Temple of Hephaestus, the Greek god of metalworking and craftsmen. This temple is still in great condition to this day. Other temples priorly standing in the agora include honor for Zeus, Athena, Apollo, and Ares.

==Location and constituents==

The agora was usually located in the middle of a city or near the harbor. Agoras were built of colonnades, or rows of long columns, and contained stoae, also known as a long open walkway below the colonnades. They were beautifully decorated with fountains, trees, and statues. When the Athenian agora was rebuilt after the Greco-Persian Wars, colonnades and stoae were not incorporated.

==Phobia==
The term agoraphobia denotes a phobic condition in which the sufferer becomes anxious in unfamiliar environments – for instance, places where they perceive that they have little control. Such anxiety may be triggered by wide-open spaces, crowds, or public situations, and the psychological term derives from the agora as a large and open gathering place.

<doc id="275259" wikidata="Q295999" url="?curid=275259" title="Ferid Murad">
<text>Ferid Murad (September 14, 1936 – September 4, 2023) was an American physician and pharmacologist, and a co-winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

== Early life ==
Ferid Murad was born in Whiting, Indiana, on September 14, 1936. His parents were Henrietta Josephine Bowman of Alton, Illinois, and Xhabir Murat Ejupi, an Albanian immigrant from Gostivar in present-day North Macedonia. who subsequently changed his name to John Murad after being processed at Ellis Island in 1913. His mother was from a Baptist family and ran away from home in 1935, aged 17, to marry his father, who was 39 and Muslim. Murad is the oldest of three boys. Murad and his brothers were raised as Catholics. He was later baptized an Episcopalian while in college. The family owned a small restaurant while Murad was growing up, and he spent his youth working at the family business.

In the eighth grade, he was asked to write an essay of his top three career choices, which he indicated as physician, teacher and pharmacist (in 1948, clinical pharmacology was not yet a discipline in medicine). He was a board-certified physician and internist doing both basic and clinical research with considerable teaching in medicine, pharmacology and clinical pharmacology and with a PhD in pharmacology.

== Education ==
Murad competed successfully for a Rector Scholarship at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, a liberal arts university on a tuition scholarship. He received his undergraduate degree in chemistry from the pre-med program at DePauw University in 1958. During his senior year of college he began to apply to medical schools when his faculty advisor Forst Fuller, a professor in the biology department suggested that he consider a new MD-PhD program at Case Western Reserve University. A fraternity brother, Bill Sutherland, also advised that he consider this new combined degree program that his father Earl Sutherland, Jr initiated in Cleveland in 1957. The program paid full tuition for both degrees and provided a modest stipend of $2,000 per year. Murad ultimately decided to attend and became an early graduate of the first explicit MD and pharmacology Ph.D. program (which would later lead to the development of the prestigious Medical Scientist Training Program) obtaining his degrees from Case Western Reserve University in 1965. He was an Intern in Internal Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital (1965–66), Resident in Internal Medicine (1966–67), Clinical Associate and Senior Assistant Surgeon, Public Health Service, National Heart and Lung Institute (1967–69) and Senior Staff Fellow there from 1969–70.

== Career ==
Murad began his academic career by joining the University of Virginia, where he was made associate professor, Depts. of Internal Medicine and Pharmacology, School of Medicine in 1970, before becoming a full professor in 1975. From 1971–81 he was Director, Clinical Research Center, UVA School of Medicine and Director, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Dept. of Internal Medicine, UVA School of Medicine (1973–81). Murad moved to Stanford University in 1981 where he was Chief of Medicine at the Palo Alto VA Medical Center (1981–86), Associate Chairman, Dept. of Medicine, Stanford University (1984–86), and Acting Chairman, Dept. of Medicine and Acting Division Chief, Division of Respiratory Medicine from 1986–88. In 1988 he was the American Heart Association, Ciba Award Recipient. Murad left his tenure at Stanford in 1988 for a position at Abbott Laboratories, where he served as a Vice President of Pharmaceutical Discovery until founding his own biotechnology company, the Molecular Geriatrics Corporation, in 1993. Murad went back to academics and joined the McGovern Medical School to create a new department of integrative biology, pharmacology, and physiology in 1997. There, he was the chairman of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology, professor and director emeritus of The Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Disease, John S. Dunn Distinguished Chair in Physiology and Medicine, deputy director of The Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, and later a professor at the Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine. In April 2011, he moved to the George Washington University as a professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

Murad&#x27;s key research demonstrated that nitroglycerin and related drugs worked by releasing nitric oxide into the body, which relaxed smooth muscle by elevating intracellular cyclic GMP. The missing steps in the signaling process were filled in by Robert F. Furchgott and Louis J. Ignarro of UCLA, for which the three shared the 1998 Nobel Prize (and for which Murad and Furchgott received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1996). In 1999, Murad and Furchgott received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was also a member of the National Academy of Sciences among other notable societies.

In 2015, Murad signed the Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change on the final day of the 65th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting. The declaration was signed by a total of 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then-President of the French Republic, François Hollande, as part of the successful COP21 climate summit in Paris.

Murad was editing a book series published by Bentham Science Publishers titled &quot;Herbal medicine: Back to the Future&quot;; two volumes of which have already been published and a third volume was in preparation.

== Death ==
Ferid Murad died in Menlo Park, California, on September 4, 2023, at the age of 86.

<text>Grand Cayman is the largest of the three Cayman Islands and the location of the territory&#x27;s capital, George Town. In relation to the other two Cayman Islands, it is approximately 75 miles (121 km) southwest of Little Cayman and 90 miles (145 km) southwest of Cayman Brac.
==Geography==
Grand Cayman encompasses 76% of the territory&#x27;s entire land mass. The island is approximately long with its widest point being wide. The elevation ranges from sea level at the beaches to above sea level on the North Side&#x27;s Mastic Trail. Unlike many other Caribbean islands, Grand Cayman is for the most part, flat. This allows for more space to build as the island&#x27;s population grows.

==Island districts==


Grand Cayman Island includes five of the six districts of the Cayman Islands: Bodden Town, East End, George Town, North Side and West Bay.
* Bodden Town – Founded in the 1700s, Bodden Town district comprises the central part of Grand Cayman Island, between the George Town and North Side districts. The village of Bodden Town was the original capital of the Cayman Islands.
* East End – The East End district is located at the east side of Grand Cayman Island and consists mostly of the Village of East End, Franklin&#x27;s Forest, Eastern Dry Forest, and other natural attractions, restaurants, and accommodations.
* George Town – The capital of the Cayman Islands and world-famous centre for offshore banking and investments,
* North Side – Includes Kaibo and Rum Point. Sand Point Cove in Rum Point is home to a Bioluminescent Bay or Bio Bay.
* West Bay – Has numerous tourist attractions including the Cayman Turtle Farm and the Cayman Motor Museum. Towns in the West Bay district include Seven Mile Beach, Hell.

The remaining district is Sister Islands, which consists of the islands of Cayman Brac and Little Cayman.

==Flora and fauna==
===Flora===
Of the flora, a good representation of the variety of plant life on Grand Cayman can be found at the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park located in the North Side District. Wild banana orchids, ghost orchids, thatch palm trees, red birch trees, mahogany trees and various fruit trees such as avocado, mango, guinep, naseberry, breadfruit, and tamarind. Yellow mastics (&quot;Sideroxylon foetidissimum&quot;) and black mastics (&quot;Terminalia eriostachya&quot;) are also seen in the park, as well as on the -long Mastic Trail. Elsewhere outside the park, all of these species can be seen around Grand Cayman, including coconut palms, &quot;Casuarina&quot; pines, mangroves, and poinciana trees.

===Fauna===
Fauna seen in various locations around the island include the endangered blue iguana (&quot;Cyclura lewisi&quot;), Grand Cayman amazon parrots (&quot;Amazona leucocephala caymanensis&quot;), Central American agoutis (&quot;Dasyprocta punctata&quot;), a species of land crab called &quot;Gecarcinus ruricola&quot;, and the island was one also the homes of the extinct Grand Cayman thrush.

The Cayman Island&#x27;s Turtle Farm located in the West Bay district raises green sea turtles for their meat and to release into the wild. Through breeding, the farm produces upwards of 1800 turtles a year. Between 1980 and 2006, the farm released approximately 30,600 turtles to the wild; because of a mark placed on each animal, the released turtles have been seen throughout the Caribbean.

There are four endemic snake species on Grand Cayman and two invasive species. They are all relatively harmless and the largest is the rarely seen invasive corn snake, which may grow to about 5 feet (1.5 m). The smallest averages 2–4 inches (5–10 cm) and is the invasive brahminy blind snake which is also rarely seen. The most common is the endemic Grand Cayman racer, (&quot;Cubophis cantherigerus&quot;). It can grow to approximately 5 feet (1.5 m), but 3-foot (91-cm) specimens are much more common. These snakes tend to race away if encountered and in rare cases will rear up in a threatening manner if cornered. The Cayman racer snake carries a mild venom which it uses to immobilise prey, but in large enough doses it can cause significant swelling and bruising if it latches on for an extended period. A simple bite and release does not usually cause any reaction in humans. The other three endemic snake species are the Cayman Islands dwarf boa, Cayman Brac blind snake and Cayman water snake.
==Demographics==
Of the three islands, Grand Cayman contains approximately 97% of the territory&#x27;s entire population. Caymanians and permanent residents make up 52% of the population. There is a prominent expat population, making up 48%, with most originating from Jamaica, the Philippines, the United States, United Kingdom, and India.

==Economy==

===Offshore banking===
There are just under 600 banks and trust companies in the Grand Cayman, including 43 of the 50 largest banks in the world. Because of this large financial presence on the island, banking, investments, and insurance drive the economy in Grand Cayman.

===Tourism===

Grand Cayman Island has a number of natural attractions: the blow holes in the East End district, the Mastic Trail that runs north to south through the center of the island, Hell in the West Bay, and the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park.

Watersports such as scuba diving and snorkeling are popular activities on Grand Cayman as the island is known for its coral reefs and underwater sea walls along with a number of shipwrecks.

Because of its clubs, resorts, and hotels, Seven Mile Beach has the largest concentration of visitors and tourists on the island.

==Transport==
Owen Roberts International Airport serves Grand Cayman with domestic and international flights. Cayman Airways has its headquarters on Grand Cayman.

Port of George Town is operated by the Port Authority of the Cayman Islands.

==Other infrastructure==
Electrical service for Grand Cayman is provided by Caribbean Utilities Company Ltd., with its corporate headquarters located on North Sound Road. Electricity on Grand Cayman runs on a 120/240 volt electricity system with electrical outlets designed to accommodate a three-pin American plug.

Grand Cayman residents have a choice of telecommunications services from C3, Digicel, FLOW (previously LIME), and Logic.

Olive Hilda Miller was the first manager of The Pines, the first retirement home to be built in the Cayman Islands. She worked there from 1983 until 1991.

<doc id="275264" wikidata="Q160325" url="?curid=275264" title="John Eliot Gardiner">
<text>Sir John Eliot Gardiner (born 20 April 1943) is an English conductor, particularly known for his performances of the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, especially the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage of 2000, performing Bach&#x27;s church cantatas in liturgical order in churches all over Europe, and New York City, with the Monteverdi Choir, and recording them at the locations.

==Life and career==
Born in Fontmell Magna, Dorset, son of Rolf Gardiner and Marabel Hodgkin, Gardiner&#x27;s early musical experience came largely through singing with his family and in a local church choir. As a child he grew up with the celebrated Haussmann portrait of J. S. Bach, which had been lent to his parents for safe keeping during the Second World War. A self-taught musician who also played the violin, he began to study conducting at the age of 15. He was educated at Bryanston School, then studied History at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where his tutor was the social anthropologist Edmund Leach.
While an undergraduate at Cambridge he launched his conducting career with a performance of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Vespro della Beata Vergine&quot; in King&#x27;s College Chapel on 5 March 1964. This either featured or led to the foundation of the Monteverdi Choir, with which he made his London conducting debut at the Wigmore Hall in 1966. Whilst at Cambridge, he conducted the Oxford and Cambridge Singers on a concert tour of the Middle East. After graduating, Gardiner continued his musical studies at King&#x27;s College London under Thurston Dart and in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, whose music had been a very early influence.

Returning to England, Gardiner joined the BBC Northern Orchestra as an apprentice conductor. In 1968 he founded the Monteverdi Orchestra. Upon changing from modern instruments to period instruments in 1977, the orchestra changed its name to the English Baroque Soloists in 1978. In 1969 Gardiner made his opera debut with a performance of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; at the English National Opera. Four years later, in 1973, he made his first appearance at the Covent Garden conducting Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot;. The English Baroque Soloists made their opera debut with him in the 1977 Innsbruck Festival of Early Music, performing Handel&#x27;s &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot; on period instruments. His American debut came in 1979 when he conducted the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. He then became the lead conductor of Canada&#x27;s CBC Vancouver Orchestra from 1980 to 1983.

After his period with the CBC Vancouver Orchestra, Gardiner went to France. From 1983 to 1988 he was Music Director of the Opéra National de Lyon. During his period with the Opéra he founded an entirely new orchestra. During his time with the Opéra National de Lyon Gardiner was also Artistic Director of the Göttingen Handel Festival (1981 until 1990). In 1989 the Monteverdi Choir had its 25th anniversary, touring the world giving performances of Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot; and Bach&#x27;s &quot;Magnificat&quot; among other works. In 1990, Gardiner formed a new period-instrument orchestra, the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, to perform music of the 19th century. From 1991 until 1995 he was principal conductor of the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra.

He founded the Monteverdi Choir (1964), the English Baroque Soloists (1978) and the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique (1989). From the 1990s onwards he undertook more world tours with his ensembles, including:
* A European tour in 1993 with the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique featured Berlioz&#x27;s rediscovered &quot;Messe solennelle&quot;. Beginning in Bremen, Germany the tour ended with a recorded performance in Westminster Cathedral, London 1993.
* In 2000, Gardiner set out on his Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, performing, over a 52-week period, all of Bach&#x27;s sacred cantatas in churches around Europe and the United States.
* In late 2004, Gardiner toured France and Spain with the Monteverdi Choir performing pieces from the &quot;Codex Calixtinus&quot; in cathedrals and churches along the Camino de Santiago.
Gardiner has recorded over 250 albums, most of which have been published by Deutsche Grammophon and Philips Classics, and by the Soli Deo Gloria label, which specialises in recordings by Gardiner and by his ensembles.

Gardiner is most famous for his interpretations of Baroque music on period instruments with the Monteverdi Choir and the English Baroque Soloists, but his repertoire and discography are not limited to early music. With the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique Gardiner has performed a wide range of Classical and Romantic music, including many works of Berlioz and all of Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies. A recording of the third symphony of the latter was used in a dramatisation by the BBC of Beethoven&#x27;s writing of that symphony. Gardiner has served as chief conductor of the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra and has appeared as guest conductor with such major orchestras as the Berlin Philharmonic, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Philharmonia, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and Vienna Philharmonic. Gardiner is also well known for his refusal to perform the music of Richard Wagner; in a 2008 interview for Gramophone Gardiner said, &#x27;I really loathe Wagner – everything he stands for – and I don&#x27;t even like his music very much.&#x27; Gardiner has been the subject of various allegations of rudeness and bullying of performers and colleagues.

In late 2012, citing health concerns, he cancelled his planned December 2013 tour of Australia with the Monteverdi Choir and the Australian Chamber Orchestra. In 2013, Gardiner published the book &quot;Bach: Music in the Castle of Heaven&quot;. In 2014 he started a five-year term as President of the Leipzig Bach Archive, being succeeded by Ton Koopman in that position in 2019. One of the realisations during Gardiner&#x27;s presidency was the Archive&#x27;s collaboration to the &quot;Bach 333&quot; box set with the complete recordings of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s works, released in 2018.

Gardiner conducted his Monteverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists in a pre-service concert at Westminster Abbey for the Coronation of King Charles III.

===Controversies===

In August 2023, Gardiner was reported to have angrily slapped and punched English bass singer William Thomas in the face in front of cast members after Thomas exited the wrong side of the podium after a performance of &quot;Les Troyens&quot; at the Berlioz Festival in La Côte Saint André. The incident resulted in a public backlash against the conductor. On 24 August 2023, Gardiner withdrew from all further engagements for &#x27;a period of reflection and, in consultation with his medical advisors ... focusing on his mental health while engaging in a course of counselling&#x27;. In July 2024 it was announced that he would be stepping down as leader and artistic director of the Monteverdi Choir and Orchestras, focusing instead on &#x27;other activities including guest conducting, recording, writing, creative and education projects.&#x27;

In September 2024, Gardiner founded the Constellation Choir and Orchestra, following his departure from the Monteverdi Choir and Orchestras earlier that year. The new ensemble attracted several former members of the Monteverdi ensembles, leading to a competitive dynamic between the groups. Some concert venues replaced scheduled Monteverdi performances with those of Gardiner&#x27;s new ensemble, further intensifying the rivalry.

== Personal life ==
Gardiner is the son of the British rural revivalist and Nazi sympathizer Rolf Gardiner (1902–1971), and the grandson of the Egyptologist Alan Gardiner (1879–1963). His mother, Marabel Hodgkin, was a member of the Hodgkin family, a notable Quaker family; the artist Sir Howard Hodgkin (1932–2017) was Gardiner&#x27;s first cousin.

Gardiner was married to violinist Elizabeth Wilcock from 1981 to 1997; they have three daughters, including screenwriter and showrunner Francesca Gardiner. From 2001 to 2019 he was married to Isabella de Sabata, granddaughter of conductor Victor de Sabata.

In his spare time, Gardiner runs a farm at Springhead near Fontmell Magna in North Dorset, which was established by his great-uncle, composer Henry Balfour Gardiner. His continued involvement in this project has earned him the nickname &#x27;Uphill Gardiner&#x27; as a consequence of his unorthodox farming methods.

In August 2014, Gardiner was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that subject.

<doc id="275266" wikidata="Q1757331" url="?curid=275266" title="List of patriarchs of the Church of the East">
<text>The Patriarch of the Church of the East was the head of the Church of the East. According to tradition, the Church of the East was founded by the apostles Thomas, Addai, Aggai, and Mari in the first century AD. At the end of the third century or beginning of the fourth century AD, Papa bar Aggai, as bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, was recognised as the first supreme head of the Church of the East, according to the Chronicle of Arbela. The bishopric of Seleucia-Ctesiphon was elevated to the status of metropolitan see at the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 410 and then granted the title of catholicos at the Synod of 424. The title of patriarch was also adopted prior to the end of the fifth century.

In the Schism of 1552, the Church of the East was split into two separate lines of patriarchs following the election of Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa as patriarch and his establishment of union with the Catholic Church in 1553. However, the Shimun line formally dissolved the union with the Catholic Church in 1672 and thus a third line of patriarchs in union with Rome was formed with the appointment of Joseph I as patriarch in 1681. With the end of the Josephite line in 1828 and the appointment of Yohannan VIII Hormizd as patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church in 1830, the Shimun line became the sole remaining line not in communion with the Catholic Church. A schism erupted again in 1968 upon the election of Thoma Darmo as patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East, whilst the Church of the East was officially renamed the Assyrian Church of the East in 1976.

<text>Gregory James LeMond (born June 26, 1961) is an American former road racing cyclist. He won the Tour de France thrice and the Road Race World Championship twice, becoming the only American male to win the former.

LeMond began his professional cycling career in 1981. Two years later, LeMond became the first American male cyclist to win the Road World Championship. He won the Tour de France in 1986, becoming the first non-European professional cyclist to win the men&#x27;s Tour. LeMond was accidentally shot with pellets and seriously injured while hunting in 1987. Following the shooting, he underwent two surgeries and missed the next two Tours. At the 1989 Tour, LeMond completed an improbable comeback to win in dramatic fashion on the race&#x27;s final stage. He successfully defended his Tour title the following year, becoming one of only nine riders to win three or more Tours. LeMond retired from competition in December 1994 and was inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1996. He was the first professional cyclist to sign a million-dollar contract and the first cyclist to appear on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

During his career, LeMond championed several technological advancements in pro cycling, including the introduction of aerodynamic &quot;triathlon&quot; handlebars and carbon fiber bicycle frames, which he later marketed through his company LeMond Bicycles. LeMond&#x27;s other business interests have included restaurants, real estate, and consumer fitness equipment. He is also a vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use in cycling and is a founding board member of 1in6.org, a nonprofit charity that assists male victims of child sex abuse.

==Early life and amateur career==
LeMond was born to Bob and Bertha LeMond on June 26, 1961, in Lakewood, California, and was raised in the Washoe Valley, a ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range between Reno, and the family home about north of Carson City, Nevada. LeMond has two sisters, Kathy and Karen.

LeMond grew up living an active, outdoor life. Hiking, hunting, skiing, and flyfishing were boyhood pastimes. The ranch country of the Sierra Nevada mountain range lent itself to such pursuits. A hyperactive youngster, LeMond believes that these outdoor activities helped keep him out of trouble. LeMond stated, &quot;I was a boy who just could not sit still. I had trouble focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today. My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles.&quot; He also said, &quot;That&#x27;s one of the traits. It&#x27;s the inability to sit down [and listen] to something you are not really interested in and absorb it. If they are interested in it, people with ADD excel in really good ways. When I got into cycling I would say the sport itself took a fog off my brain. I was able to absorb stuff I read. It changed my life.&quot;

LeMond attended Earl Wooster High School in Reno but lived too far away to participate in team sports. He soon biked almost daily to high school, often riding home from Wooster, taking a route over Mt. Rose, along to Incline Village, then south on Hwy 28, then downhill to Carson City, then to his home. 

LeMond&#x27;s introduction to cycling came in 1975, thanks to freestyle skiing pioneer Wayne Wong, who recommended the bike as an ideal off-season training aid. LeMond started competing the following year, and after dominating the Intermediate category (13–15) and winning the first 11 races he entered, LeMond received permission to ride against older, more seasoned competitors in the Junior (16–19) category.

In 1977, at age 15, LeMond finished second in the Tour of Fresno to John Howard, then the United States&#x27;s top road cyclist and the 1971 Pan American Games champion. He caught the attention of Eddie Borysewicz, the US Cycling Federation&#x27;s national team coach, who described LeMond as &quot;a diamond, a clear diamond.&quot; LeMond represented the United States at the 1978 Junior World Championships in Washington, D.C., where he finished ninth in the road race, and again in the 1979 Junior World Championships in Argentina, winning gold, silver and bronze medals—the highlight being his victory in the road race. At age 18, LeMond was selected for the 1980 U.S. Olympic cycling team, the youngest ever to make the team. However, the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow prevented him from competing there.

Borysewicz, whom LeMond described as his &quot;first real coach,&quot; wanted to retain his protégé through the next Olympic cycle and discouraged him from turning pro, but LeMond was determined. Nevertheless, while he was the reigning Junior World Road Champion in 1980, LeMond received no professional offers, and so in the spring of 1980, he joined the U.S. National cycling team for a six-week European racing campaign. There, LeMond finished third overall in the Circuit des Ardennes before winning the 1980 Circuit de la Sarthe stage race in France, thereby becoming the first American and youngest rider of any nationality &quot;in the history of the sport to win a major pro-am cycling event [in Europe].&quot; That victory, and the subsequent press coverage, raised LeMond&#x27;s profile in Europe and he was scouted at his next event (the Ruban Granitier Breton stage race) by Cyrille Guimard, the Renault–Elf–Gitane team&#x27;s directeur sportif. Guimard said that he was impressed with LeMond&#x27;s spirit, and told him, &quot;You have the fire to be a great champion&quot;, before offering LeMond a professional contract for 1981 with Renault. After returning to the United States, LeMond won the 1980 Nevada City Classic, considered to be one of the most historic and challenging professional cycling races in United States. Despite eventually receiving several other offers to turn professional besides Guimard&#x27;s, LeMond did not consider them seriously, and he signed with Renault in Paris on the day the 1980 Tour de France finished.

==Professional career==
LeMond was an &quot;exceptionally gifted&quot; amateur rider who quickly established himself as one of the most talented cyclists on the professional circuit. Respected cycling journalist John Wilcockson, who reported the Tour de France for more than 40 years, described LeMond as a rider who was &quot;fuoriclasse&quot;.

===1981–1983: Early years===
LeMond&#x27;s first professional victory came three months into his 1981 debut when he won a stage of the French Tour de l&#x27;Oise. LeMond followed with a win in the Coors Classic in the United States, finishing ahead of Sergei Sukhoruchenkov, the 1980 Olympic Road champion. The major step forward in 1981 occurred in the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré stage race, where LeMond placed third. The achievement is the more remarkable because he rode the race in support of team leader Bernard Hinault. LeMond missed standing on the podium with race winner Hinault, as Pascal Simon had finished ahead of him. Two weeks later, Simon was assessed a 10-minute penalty when it was discovered he had been doping. LeMond considered the race to have been a &quot;major steppingstone&quot; in his career. LeMond stated, &quot;It showed me that I had the kind of climbing ability that you need to win the top European stage races.&quot; He won a total of five races in his rookie season of 1981.

On April 11, 1982, LeMond broke his collarbone while racing the cycling classic Liège–Bastogne–Liège. The injury forced LeMond to ride a reduced schedule before entering the World Championships, which were in Goodwood, England that year. In the men&#x27;s road race competition, LeMond broke for the line but was out-sprinted by Italian Giuseppe Saronni. Following the race, LeMond&#x27;s American teammate Jacques Boyer accused LeMond of chasing him down in the final 800 meters. Saronni was very strong at the end of the race and flew past Boyer and LeMond, winning by five seconds over LeMond, with another five seconds back to Kelly. Boyer placed tenth. Bronze medalist Sean Kelly, a favorite to win the race, was with Saronni when he caught LeMond with about 200 meters to go, but he could not hold his wheel. Said Kelly: &quot;I don&#x27;t think that Boyer was fading ... He got quite a good gap. Nobody wanted to go after him ... Yes, LeMond chased down Boyer. Boyer was the only man up the road.&quot;

LeMond was supported by his teammate George Mount, who observed, &quot;What&#x27;s LeMond going to do? Throw his bike down in front of everybody because Boyer is such a good buddy of everyone? ... Hell no—he&#x27;s going to start sprinting because it&#x27;s less than 200 meters to go and the sprint&#x27;s already been going for a couple hundred meters. LeMond made a good move and a good sprint ... Boyer was not going to win that race. The best he could have got was fifth or sixth place.&quot;

LeMond did not apologize. The U.S. team was not as set up as the European teams, and did not have an independent race to determine the national champion. Instead, the highest finisher at the World&#x27;s was considered the national champion. LeMond had argued for the team to compete as the European teams did, but team management and Boyer voted against him. Thus, unlike the other teams at the world championship, the US riders were competing against each other. At age 21, LeMond was the first American pro to win a medal at the World&#x27;s since Frank Kramer took silver in 1912. LeMond stated, &quot;I&#x27;m racing for Renault and I&#x27;m racing for myself. It&#x27;s a business and it&#x27;s my living. To me, that second place was almost as good as winning, especially at my age.&quot;

Two weeks later, on September 20, 1982, LeMond won the mountainous 12-day, Tour de l&#x27;Avenir by a record 10 minutes, 18 seconds. The victory, and the time advantage LeMond held at the end, stunned Europe and provided broad confirmation that LeMond was indeed &quot;fuoriclasse&quot;.

The following year in 1983, LeMond won the Road World Championship in Altenrhein, Switzerland outright, becoming the first American male cyclist to do so. (Audrey McElmury won in 1969 and Beth Heiden won in 1980.) LeMond&#x27;s cycling talent—his overall strength, climbing ability, ability to ride a fast time trial, and his capacity to recover quickly—all suggested LeMond would be an excellent prospect for the most demanding Grand Tours.

===1984–1986: Grand Tours===
LeMond rode his first Tour de France in 1984, finishing third in support of team leader Laurent Fignon, and winning the white jersey of the young rider classification. The following year, he was brought across to La Vie Claire to ride in support of team captain Bernard Hinault who had regained his form and was attempting to win his fifth Tour. French businessman and team owner Bernard Tapie signed LeMond with a $1 million contract over three years. In the race, Hinault led through the early mountain stages, but suffered a crash and came into difficulty. At this point, it was clear that LeMond was an elite rider capable of winning the Tour in his own right. LeMond possessed a natural talent for riding the Grand Tours and got stronger over the course of a three-week race. The injured Hinault was vulnerable, and his competitors knew it. Stage 17 included three major climbs in the Pyrenees. On the second, the Col du Tourmalet, LeMond followed Stephen Roche in an attack, but was not given permission to help build on the gap over the field. The managers of his La Vie Claire team ordered the 24-year-old LeMond not to ride with Roche, but to sit on his wheel, a tactic to use the rider in front as cover for wind resistance so the following rider uses less energy. The pace Roche could put out by himself eventually slowed, and other riders came up to join the two men. Hinault recovered as well, though he did not regain the lead group. At the end of the stage, LeMond was frustrated to the point of tears. He later revealed that team management and his own coach Paul Köchli had misled him as to how far back Hinault had dropped during the crucial Stage 17 mountain stage. Hinault won the 1985 Tour, with LeMond finishing second, 1:42 behind. LeMond had ridden as the dutiful lieutenant, and his support enabled Hinault to win his fifth Tour. In repayment for his sacrifice, Hinault promised to help LeMond win the Tour the following year.

Hoping to end the season on a high note, LeMond entered the World Championships road race with the strongest team the United States ever fielded. Riders included Boyer and LeMond, as well as Andrew Hampsten, Ron Kiefel, Bob Roll and Eric Heiden and this time the American team was set up to help the three strongest riders in LeMond, then Hampsten and Kiefel. Throughout the race, LeMond answered repeated attacks and led many chase groups to contain dangerous breakaways, but by the final lap of the race, he was beginning to tire. However, LeMond was part of the group that was going to win, and while Hampsten and Keifel survived the race to this point, they were too far back to assist LeMond in the final . Inside the final kilometer, the last rider to launch an attack was former Tour and Vuelta champion Joop Zoetemelk. Being as he was 38 years old and long past his prime, none of the remaining contenders, including LeMond, Claudio Corti, Robert Millar, Moreno Argentin, or Stephen Roche, took the attack seriously at first. Zoetemelk opened a sizeable gap, but before long, it was in excess of 100 meters and quickly growing. He also had two teammates remaining in Johan van der Velde and Gerard Veldscholten, assisting him by riding at the front but not actually chasing, therefore slowing the chase group. Italian rider Moreno took up the chase, but he had nothing left to close the gap and actually put his hand in the air waving for the other riders to come forward and take up the pursuit. LeMond also had nothing left to chase down this final attack feeling that if he did, LeMond would not have anything left for the sprint and would not win any medal at all. In a notable upset, Zoetemelk beat the favorites to the line by three seconds as LeMond out-sprinted Argentin to take the silver. There was no controversy following this silver medal for LeMond, and he rode up alongside the Dutchman immediately after the race to congratulate him by saying, &quot;Nice ride Joop.&quot;

For the 1986 Tour, LeMond was a co-leader of the La Vie Claire team alongside Hinault. Hinault&#x27;s support seemed less certain the closer the race approached. An unspoken condition was that his help would be contingent upon LeMond demonstrating that he was clearly the better rider. Hinault was in superb form, and had the chance to win an unprecedented sixth Tour. Hinault chose to let the Stage 9 individual time trial be the decider for which rider would receive the full support of team La Vie Claire. Hinault won the Stage 9 time trial, finishing 44 seconds in front of LeMond. LeMond had bad luck during the stage, having suffered a punctured tire requiring a wheel change, and later in the stage a bicycle change was required when he broke a wheel. LeMond was frustrated with the outcome and the impact it would have on how the team would function for the remainder of the race. In Stage 12, the first mountain stage of the race in the Pyrenees, Hinault attacked the lead group and built up an overall lead. By the end of Stage 12, Hinault had a five-minute lead over LeMond and the other top riders. He claimed he was trying to draw out LeMond&#x27;s rivals, but none of these attacks were planned with LeMond. He was clearly willing to ride aggressively and take advantage of the opportunities presented. LeMond was never placed in difficulty, except by his own teammate. The following day, Hinault broke away again early but was caught and then dropped by LeMond on the final climb of Stage 13, allowing LeMond to gain back four and a half minutes. The next three stages brought the Tour to the Alps. On Stage 17, LeMond and Urs Zimmermann dropped Hinault from the leading group, and the end of the day saw LeMond pulling on the yellow jersey of race leader, the first time it had ever been worn by a rider from the United States. The following day in the Alps saw Hinault attack again early on the first climb, but he was pulled back. Attempting an escape on the descent, Hinault was unable to separate himself from LeMond. The La Vie Claire team leaders were both excellent descenders. As they ascended up the next col, they continued to pull away from the field and maintained the gap as they reached the base of the final climb, the vaunted Alpe d&#x27;Huez. They pressed on through the crowd, ascending the 21 switchbacks of Alpe d&#x27;Huez and reaching the summit together. LeMond put an arm around Hinault and gave him a smile and the stage win in a show of unity, but the infighting was not over. Hinault attacked again on Stage 19 and had to be brought back by teammates Andrew Hampsten and Steve Bauer. Commenting on the team situation prior to the final individual time trial at Stage 20, LeMond offered the following with a wry smile: &quot;He&#x27;s attacked me from the beginning of the Tour De France. He&#x27;s never helped me once, and I don&#x27;t feel confident at all with him.&quot;

LeMond had to keep his eye on his teammate and rival throughout the race. Hinault rode aggressively and repeatedly attacked, and the division created in the La Vie Claire team was unmistakable. LeMond would keep the yellow jersey to the end of the race and win his first Tour, but he felt betrayed by Hinault and the La Vie Claire team leadership. LeMond later stated that the 1986 Tour was the most difficult and stressful race of his career.

===1987–1988: Shooting accident and recovery===
LeMond had planned to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but he was unable to participate. Earlier that year, while riding in the Tirreno–Adriatico spring tune-up race, LeMond fell and fractured his left wrist. He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe, LeMond went turkey hunting on a ranch co-owned by his father in Lincoln, California. LeMond was with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle, and brother-in-law. The trio had become separated when Blades, who heard movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush. The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with approximately 60 pellets. LeMond&#x27;s injuries were life-threatening, but a police helicopter was already airborne near the scene and transported LeMond on a 15-minute air medical flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume. A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death. The operation saved his life, but four months later LeMond developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting. He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time. LeMond then informed his team that he had had his appendix removed, but the rest of the story was left somewhat vague. The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.

With 35 shotgun pellets still in his body, including three in the lining of his heart and five more embedded in his liver, LeMond attempted to return to racing in 1988. His comeback was hampered by over-training which resulted in tendonitis in his right shin requiring surgery. LeMond missed the Tour for the second year running. Tensions in the relationship between LeMond and PDM were aggravated when LeMond discovered that doping was going on at the PDM squad. The result was that LeMond moved from PDM, one of the strongest teams in the peloton, to ADR, a team based in Belgium. The team was co-sponsored by Coors Light for American races. The deal was completed on New Year&#x27;s Eve, just hours before LeMond would have been legally obliged to ride another season for the Dutch team. Joining the Belgian ADR squad allowed LeMond to continue to compete, but with teammates like Johan Museeuw who were better suited to riding Classics than Grand Tours.

===1989: Return to elite level===

After struggling in the 1989 Paris–Nice early-season race and failing to improve his condition, LeMond informed his wife Kathy that he intended to retire from professional cycling after the 1989 Tour de France. LeMond had some flashes of form with sixth overall in Tirreno–Adriatico and in the two-day Critérium International, sharing an escape with Fignon, Indurain, Mottet, Roche, and Madiot and finishing fourth overall. He started the 1989 Giro d&#x27;Italia in May as preparation for the Tour to follow, but struggled in the mountains and was not in contention for any of the leaders&#x27; jerseys before the final individual time trial into Florence. LeMond placed a surprising second there, more than a minute ahead of overall winner Laurent Fignon. LeMond attributed some of his improvement to an anti-anemia treatment he received twice during the race.

Coming into the 1989 Tour de France LeMond was not considered a contender for the general classification (GC). His own most optimistic hope was to finish his final Tour in the top 20. Without the weight of expectation and other pressures of being a Tour favorite, LeMond surprised observers with a strong ride in the prologue in Luxembourg, finishing fourth out of 198 riders. Buoyed by the result, LeMond continued to ride well over the opening flat stages, winning the stage 5 individual time trial, and gaining the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification for the first time in three years. He seemed to ride himself into better condition during the first week&#x27;s flat stages, and LeMond was coming into peak form by the time the Tour reached the mountains. He remained at the front of the race in the Pyrénées but lost the lead to his former teammate and rival Laurent Fignon on stage 10 in Superbagnères. Five days later, LeMond reclaimed yellow in the Alps, after the stage 15 mountain time trial from Gap to Orcières-Merlette. The see-saw battle continued, and when Fignon attacked on the upper slopes of Alpe d&#x27;Huez, LeMond was unable to go with him, placing the yellow jersey back on the shoulders of Fignon. Fignon held a 50-second advantage over LeMond going into the 21st and final stage, a rare individual time trial from Versailles to the Champs-Élysées in Paris.

Fignon had won the Tour twice before, in 1983 and 1984, and was a very capable time trialist. It seemed improbable that LeMond could take 50 seconds off Fignon over the short course. This would require LeMond to gain two seconds per kilometer against one of the fastest chrono-specialists in the world. LeMond had done wind tunnel testing in the off season and perfected his riding position. He rode the time trial with a rear disc wheel, a cut-down Giro aero helmet and the same Scott clip-on aero bars which had helped him to the Stage 5 time trial win. Holding his time trialing position, LeMond was able to generate less aerodynamic drag than Fignon, who used a pair of disc wheels but chose to go helmetless and did not use the aero bars that are now commonplace in time trials. Instructing his support car not to give him his split times, LeMond rode flat-out and finished at a record pace to beat Fignon by eight seconds and claim his second Tour de France victory. As LeMond embraced his wife and rejoiced on the Champs-Élysées, Fignon collapsed onto the tarmac, then sat in shock and wept.

The final margin of victory of eight seconds is the closest in the Tour&#x27;s history. LeMond&#x27;s average speed for the stage 21 time trial was, at that time, the fastest in Tour history. Since then, only the 1994 and 2015 prologues and David Zabriskie&#x27;s 2005 time trial performance have been faster. The press immediately labeled LeMond&#x27;s come-from-behind triumph as, &quot;the most astonishing victory in Tour de France history,&quot; and while LeMond admitted that it felt almost &quot;too good to be true&quot;, he personally rated it as &quot;much more satisfying&quot; than his first overall Tour win in 1986.

LeMond&#x27;s return to the pinnacle of cycling was confirmed on August 27, when he won the World Championships road race in Chambéry, France. Late in the race with less than to go the lead group, who had been away since very early in the race, made up of three very strong riders in Steven Rooks, Thierry Claveyrolat, and Soviet star Dimitri Konyshev were trying to hold on to fight for the victory amongst themselves when Laurent Fignon broke away from the pursuing group in an effort to chase the leaders down and solo to victory. On the final climb of the race, LeMond attacked in pursuit of Fignon on his own. Before long, LeMond had caught the Frenchman and not long after that the pair could see the lead group in front of them and they were quickly closing the gap. LeMond briefly dropped Fignon and caught the lead group on his own. Immediately upon catching Rooks, Claveyrolat, and Konyshev, LeMond moved to the front and set the pace as two other riders in Canadian Steve Bauer and Irishman Sean Kelly attempted to bridge the gap up to LeMond and the lead group. Bauer ended up getting a flat tire, essentially ending his hopes at a high finish, while Sean Kelly was able to fight his way to the front group, which was bad news for LeMond and the others as Kelly was one of the best sprinters in the world. Fignon was able to rejoin the lead group as well and as the race approached the finish Fignon attacked on numerous occasions trying to drop the remaining riders. Rooks also launched an attack to go for the solo victory but was caught by LeMond, Fignon, and the others. Inside the final kilometer, Fignon continued attacking trying to break free, but could not force open a gap and began to fall back as the sprint materialized, eventually finishing in sixth place. LeMond, Konyshev, and Kelly were the strongest riders when it came to the final sprint for victory, and they finished in that order. After the race, LeMond said that he did not feel well and even considered abandoning the race. With two laps to go, LeMond began feeling stronger and stated, &quot;I was racing for the gold medal. I wanted that World Championship. And with one kilometer to go, I knew I could get it.&quot; He was only the fifth person in history to win both the Tour de France and the World Championship in the same year. In December, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine named LeMond its 1989 &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot;, the first time a cyclist received the honor.

===1990: A third Tour win===
LeMond parlayed the success of his 1989 season into the then-richest contract in the sport&#x27;s history, signing a $5.5 million deal for three years with of France, the first time a cyclist had signed a multi-million dollar contract. He entered the 1990 Tour de France as defending champion and a pre-race favorite after leaving ADR to join the much stronger French team. At &quot;Z&quot; his teammates included Robert Millar, Éric Boyer, and Ronan Pensec, all of whom already had finishes in the top six of the Tour de France. This unified roster of strong riders appeared capable of supporting LeMond in the mountains and controlling the race on the flats.
The squad&#x27;s tactical plan was upset on the first day, when a breakaway that included LeMond&#x27;s teammate Ronan Pensec, but no major favorites, arrived ten minutes ahead of the field. LeMond was prevented from challenging for the lead until the yellow jersey left the shoulders of his teammate. Surprisingly, Pensec held the lead through the first high mountain stages, including Alpe d&#x27;Huez, but he lost it soon after to the relative unknown Claudio Chiappucci.

LeMond closed in on Chiappucci, and on stage 16, LeMond put his stamp of authority on the race during the final climb of Luz Ardiden. Late in this stage, after all of the breakaways had been caught, LeMond launched a devastating attack that no one could answer. Miguel Induráin was the only rider able to get on LeMond&#x27;s wheel but it was LeMond dictating the pace all the way up the climb as Chiappucci, Delgado, and all of the other favorites fell further and further behind. While Induráin stayed with LeMond, he was not a threat for victory, but his performance put the cycling world on notice; he went on to win the next five Tours. Near the end of the stage, LeMond sat up and the Spaniard took the stage win, but the devastation of LeMond&#x27;s competitors was all but complete as there was now only +0:05 between LeMond and the yellow jersey.

LeMond finally overtook Chiappucci on the final individual time trial on stage 20, where he finished over two minutes ahead of the unheralded Italian. LeMond at last had the yellow jersey, wearing it the following day as the Tour rode into Paris. He won the 1990 Tour without taking any of the individual stages. LeMond remains the last rider to win the Tour while wearing the world champion jersey. Over the course of the 1990 Tour, the perceived strength of the Z team was confirmed, as they led the team classification through most of the race, adding the team title to LeMond&#x27;s yellow jersey. His 1990 Tour victory made LeMond one of just five cyclists to win three or more Tours. As of 2024, a total of eight cyclists have won thrice or more.

In September, LeMond attempted to defend his title at the 1990 UCI Road World Championships, but finished fourth, eight seconds behind the winner, his former teammate Rudy Dhaenens of Belgium.

===1991–1994: Change in the peloton and retirement===
LeMond felt confident before the 1991 Tour de France. He was the defending champion, trained well, and had a solid team to support him. LeMond was among the leaders going into the Stage 8 individual time trial, and he finished second to the Spaniard Miguel Induráin. LeMond felt that he was riding extremely well, and though his TT-effort had propelled him into the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification, losing eight seconds to Indurain shook his confidence. LeMond held the yellow jersey for the next four days until Stage 12, a challenging mountain stage. He experienced difficulty on the first climb, and he cracked on the Col du Tourmalet, losing significant time to Claudio Chiappucci, and eventual winner Indurain. LeMond continued to race, but was unable to seriously challenge for the lead thereafter, finishing the 1991 Tour seventh overall.

In 1992, LeMond won the Tour DuPont, which would be the last major win of his career. LeMond also had a strong top 10 finish in Paris–Roubaix early in the season. He never won any of cycling&#x27;s &#x27;Monument&#x27; races, but LeMond had several high places in four out of five of them throughout his career including fourth in Paris–Roubaix, third in Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and second in Milan San Remo as well as the Giro di Lombardia.

In the 1992 Tour de France, LeMond started strongly and finished fourth in a breakaway on Stage 6 that put him fifth overall. LeMond maintained his fifth place until the mountain stages when he lost form disastrously and lost more than 45 minutes on the stage to Sestrieres before quitting the race the next day—when his compatriot and former domestique Andrew Hampsten won atop Alpe d&#x27;Huez. While LeMond claimed a serious saddle sore caused him to abandon, he had earlier stated, &quot;My climbing is not like usual. I&#x27;ve climbed much better in the past Tours. This year I&#x27;m just not feeling my usual self.&quot;

LeMond did extensive endurance training on the road the following winter, but his performances the following spring failed to improve. LeMond had to abandon the 1993 Giro d&#x27;Italia two days before the final stage after difficult racing left him 125th on GCC and third-from-last in the final time trial. LeMond was too exhausted to enter the 1993 Tour de France. Following the 1993 season, he hired renowned Dutch physiologist Adrie van Diemen to advise him on a new technique to monitor training and measure performance. The (SRM) power-based training would make use of the watt as a guide to power output. In November 1993, LeMond confided to Samuel Abt that power output in watts would become the key metric. The watt has gained wide acceptance as the best measure of a cyclist&#x27;s training performance.

The following year, LeMond began the 1994 Tour de France but found that he was unable to race effectively. LeMond had to abandon after the first week before the race had reached the difficult mountain stages. That December, he announced his retirement. At the time, the reasons for LeMond&#x27;s increasing difficulties were not entirely known. At a loss, he speculated that a condition known as mitochondrial myopathy might be responsible for the difficulty he was having performing against the current riders. However, in 2007, LeMond speculated that he might not have had the condition after all, and suggested that lead toxicity from the shotgun pellets still embedded in his body might have been responsible, the effects of which were increased by heavy training.

LeMond has acknowledged since 2010 that the increasing prevalence of doping in cycling contributed to his lack of competitiveness. LeMond stated, &quot;Something had changed in cycling. The speeds were faster and riders that I had easily outperformed were now dropping me. At the time, the team I was on, Team Z, became more and more demanding, more and more concerned...&quot; He stated he had been told in 1994 that he would need to blood dope in order to win again. He frankly admitted to Abt in 1999: &quot;I figure I had three months that went right for me after the hunting accident,&quot; three months in which LeMond won the two Tours and a world road race championship. &quot;The rest were just pure suffering, struggling, fatigue, always tired.&quot;

In a wide-ranging interview with American novelist Bryan Malessa in 1998, LeMond was asked if his career had not been interrupted by the hunting accident, how did he feel he would compare to five-time Tour winners such as Bernard Hinault and Miguel Induráin. LeMond responded: &quot;Of course you can&#x27;t rewrite racing history, but I&#x27;m confident that I would have won five Tours.&quot;

Two years after his retirement, LeMond was inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in a ceremony at Rodale Park in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania. The event was held on June 8, 1996, during the U.S. Olympic Cycling Team Trials.

In July 2014, ESPN announced the premiere of a new &quot;30 for 30&quot; film entitled &quot;Slaying the Badger&quot;. The film centers on LeMond and his former teammate Hinault at the 1986 Tour de France. It is based on the book of the same name by Richard Moore, and it premiered on ESPN on July 22.

A 2022 documentary entitled &quot;The Last Rider&quot; directed by Alex Holmes for New Black Films, features Lemond, and wife Kathy, and details Lemond&#x27;s life and career.

==Business interests==
LeMond was a pioneer in the use of carbon fiber bicycle frames in European professional road cycling, and his Tour de France win in 1986 ahead of Bernard Hinault was the first for a carbon-framed bicycle. Ironically, given the rivalry that existed at the time between the American and his French teammate, LeMond rode a &quot;Bernard Hinault&quot; Signature Model Look prototype that year. LeMond also won the 1989 Tour de France, the 1989 World Championship, and his final Tour de France in 1990 on carbon fiber frames. These bicycle frames featured &quot;Greg LeMond&quot; branding.

===LeMond Cycles===
In 1990, LeMond founded LeMond Bicycles to develop machines for himself that would also be marketed and sold to the public. The following year, searching for an equipment edge for Team Z at the 1991 Tour de France, LeMond concluded an exclusive licensing agreement between his company and Carbonframes, Inc., to access the latter&#x27;s advanced composites technology. Whilst using the bikes for the 1991 Tour, he would maintain his carbon bike in his hotel room, leading his mechanics to fear it had been stolen. While LeMond briefly led the 1991 Tour overall, riding his Carbonframes-produced &quot;Greg LeMond&quot; bicycle, the company eventually faltered, something LeMond blamed on &quot;under-capitalization&quot; and poor management by his father. Carbonframes and LeMond Cycles &quot;parted amiably two years later.&quot; In 1995, with his company allegedly nearly bankrupt, LeMond reached a licensing-agreement with Trek Bicycle Corporation, according to which the Wisconsin-based company would manufacture and distribute bicycles designed with LeMond that would be sold under the &quot;LeMond Bicycles&quot; brand. LeMond would later claim that going into business with Trek &quot;destroyed&quot; his relationship with his father. The lucrative partnership, which generated revenue for Trek in excess of US$100,000,000, would be renewed several times over the course of 13 years, but it ultimately ended in acrimony after LeMond&#x27;s relationship with Trek deteriorated over his staunch anti-doping advocacy.

LeMond found himself at odds with Trek in July 2001 after he expressed public concern over the relationship between Italian doping doctor Michele Ferrari and Trek&#x27;s star athlete, Lance Armstrong. Trek president John Burke pressured LeMond to apologize, claiming, &quot;Greg&#x27;s public comments hurt the LeMond brand and the Trek brand.&quot; Burke allegedly justified his demand for an apology by advising that, &quot;As a contractual partner, he [LeMond] could criticize doping only generally – not point his finger at specific athletes, particularly one that happens to be the company&#x27;s main cash cow.&quot; Armstrong reportedly said privately he could &quot;shut him up&quot; by contacting Trek, as documented in affidavits by Frankie and Betsy Andreu released in the 2012 USADA doping report. LeMond issued an apology for his comment.

In a 2007 interview, LeMond accused Armstrong of trying to sabotage his relationship with Trek bicycles. In March 2008, LeMond Cycling Inc sued Trek for failing to properly promote and distribute the LeMond brand, and for attempting to &quot;silence&quot; LeMond&#x27;s public comments about doping, attributing this to the influence of Armstrong on Trek. His complaint included statistics detailing slow sales in some markets, including the fact that between September 2001 and June 2007, Trek only sold $10,393 worth of LeMond bikes in France, a country in which LeMond was both famous and popular. Trek responded in April 2008, announcing that it was dropping LeMond Bicycles from its product line and that it would sue to sever the licensing agreement.
As promised, Trek counter-sued and stopped producing bicycles under the LeMond brand. After nearly two years of litigation, LeMond reached a confidential out-of-court settlement with Trek in February 2010. The settlement permitted the case to be dismissed with prejudice, meaning that &quot;neither side can produce the same claims against one another in a future lawsuit.&quot; Although settlement terms were not disclosed, LeMond reportedly obtained full control over the LeMond Bicycles name, while Trek made a donation of US$200,000 to the charity 1in6, of which LeMond was a founding member of the board of directors.

===LeMond Fitness/Revolution===
In 2002, LeMond, Bernie Boglioli, and others founded LeMond Fitness, Inc. &quot;to help individuals achieve their fitness and performance goals and train more effectively.&quot; The company&#x27;s primary business is the development and manufacture of bicycle trainers and indoor exercise bikes for consumers in the United States and internationally. LeMond serves as chairman of the board. In 2012, Hoist Fitness negotiated to purchase an interest in the company and announced plans to move its headquarters to Hoist&#x27;s offices in San Diego, California. In late 2012, LeMond purchased the LeMond Revolution from Hoist, relaunching with a new management team in Minneapolis. Later, he also formed LeMond LLC to introduce a suite of brands. Professional cycling&#x27;s team renewed its sponsorship with LeMond to use its Revolution trainers for another three seasons. The team won several stages of the Tour de France, plus the general classification of the 2012 Giro d&#x27;Italia.

===Partnership with Time===
At the Interbike trade show in September 2013, LeMond announced that he was returning to the business of bicycle manufacture and sales by partnering with French company Time. The new line began with a series of commemorative designed bicycles, to be followed with road, cyclocross, and gravel-road models. LeMond purchased Time Sport USA, the US distributor for the company. He stated, &quot;I&#x27;m really excited to be back in the bike industry.&quot;

===Real estate===
In 2002, LeMond joined his parents-in-law David and Sacia Morris, friend Michael Snow, and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. fund manager Jorge Jasson to invest in the exclusive Yellowstone Club, a Big Sky, Montana, private ski and golf community founded by timber baron Tim Blixseth and his wife Edra. Each of the five partners paid Blixseth $750,000 for one percent shares in the exclusive resort. LeMond also purchased several building lots and maintained a property at the resort. Four years later, LeMond and partners sued Blixseth in 2006 following reports of a Credit Suisse loan to the resort of $375 million from which Blixseth reportedly took $209 million in a disputed partial payout for his ownership stake. The Credit Suisse loan was based on a $1.16 billion Cushman &amp; Wakefield valuation of the resort, for which LeMond and partners each sought $11.6 million for their one-percent shares. In 2007, LeMond settled his suit with the Blixseths for $39 million. However, LeMond and his partners remained creditors as the Blixseths defaulted on a $20 million payment (after having already paid the group $18 million). In 2009, the Blixseths divorced and the Club went bankrupt.

===Restaurants===
LeMond became a restaurateur in August 1990 when, in partnership with his wife and her parents, he opened &quot;Scott Kee&#x27;s Tour de France&quot; on France Avenue in the Minneapolis suburb of Edina, Minnesota. LeMond described the restaurant, which was named for its chef (LeMond&#x27;s brother-in-law), as &quot;a dream of five years come true.&quot; Explaining the origin of the concept, LeMond said, &quot;Kathy and I have eaten at the finest establishments in France, Italy and Belgium. Our favorites have always been small places, family-owned.&quot; He also partnered in several Bruegger&#x27;s bagel bakery–café franchises.

===LeMond Composites===
LeMond founded LeMond Composites in 2016 to manufacture high-volume, low-cost carbon fiber composites under a licensing agreement with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and an exclusive 20-year licensing agreement with Deakin University. In 2017, LeMond and his family moved from Minnesota to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to be close to the $125 million LeMond Composites manufacturing facility.

On October 16, 2017, Australian politician Sarah Henderson announced that LeMond Composites would receive AU$2.5 million (US$ million) in Australian Federal Government funding to establish a carbon fiber manufacturing plant in Geelong, Australia.

==Broadcasting==
In 2014, LeMond joined Eurosport as a pundit for the channel&#x27;s cycling coverage, providing analysis at Paris–Roubaix, the Giro d&#x27;Italia and the Tour de France, and hosting his own monthly program &quot;LeMond on Cycling&quot;. He continued to work for the channel until 2017.

==Anti-doping stance and controversies==
LeMond is a longtime vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use. He first spoke on-record against doping in cycling after winning the 1989 Tour de France. LeMond has consistently questioned the relationship between riders and unethical sports doctors and has pointed out that doping products ultimately victimize the professional cyclists who make use of them. LeMond stated, &quot;When I speak out about doping people could translate it and think it was about the riders. Actually I feel like I am an advocate for the riders. I look at them as being treated like lab rats that are test vehicles for the doctors. The doctors, the management, the officials, they&#x27;re the ones that have corrupted riders. The riders are the only ones that pay the price.&quot;

In 2001, LeMond received intense criticism when he publicly criticized Lance Armstrong&#x27;s relationship with Dr. Michele Ferrari. Ferrari is an Italian physician and sports trainer who admitted to practicing blood doping and advocated the controlled use of the banned substance erythropoietin by athletes. Upon learning of Armstrong&#x27;s association with Ferrari, LeMond stated:

&quot;When Lance won the prologue to the 1999 Tour I was close to tears, but when I heard he was working with Michele Ferrari I was devastated. In the light of Lance&#x27;s relationship with Ferrari, I just don&#x27;t want to comment on this year&#x27;s Tour. This is not sour grapes. I&#x27;m disappointed in Lance, that&#x27;s all it is.&quot;

LeMond&#x27;s comments placed him in the center of an anti-doping controversy. About a month later, following pressure from both Armstrong and Trek, LeMond issued an apology for his comment; he called Armstrong &quot;a great champion&quot;, and added, &quot;I do not believe, in any way, that he has ever used any performance-enhancing substances. I believe his performances are the result of the same hard work, dedication and focus that were mine 10 years ago.&quot;

In 2004, LeMond spoke out again. On the heels of successive Tour de France wins by Armstrong, LeMond said, &quot;If Armstrong&#x27;s clean, it&#x27;s the greatest comeback. And if he&#x27;s not, then it&#x27;s the greatest fraud.&quot; LeMond went public with the fallout of his 2001 statement, alleging that Armstrong had threatened to defame him and threatened his business interests as well:
&quot;[Armstrong] basically said &#x27;I could find 10 people that will say you took EPO&#x27; ... The week after, I got multiple people that were on Lance ... Lance&#x27;s camp, basically saying &#x27;You better be quiet,&#x27; and I was quiet for three years. I have a business ... I have bikes that are sold ... and I was told that my sales might not be doing too well if ... just the publicity, the negative publicity.&quot; The same month, LeMond told French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; that Armstrong was &quot;ready to do anything to keep his secret. I don&#x27;t know how he can continue to convince everybody of his innocence.&quot; At a press conference Armstrong gave in September 2008 to announce his return to cycling, LeMond publicly challenged him with questions about doping. Armstrong appeared angry and interrupted LeMond, telling him it was time to move on. In August 2012, the USADA announced that Armstrong had been issued a lifetime ban from cycling competition due to his involvement in a massive doping scheme. In addition, the USADA stripped Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles.

LeMond has also clashed with fellow Tour rider Floyd Landis regarding the doping issue. On May 17, 2007, LeMond testified at a USADA hearing convened to weigh the evidence of doping by Landis during the 2006 Tour de France. Under oath, LeMond described a phone conversation he had with Landis on August 6, 2006, as well as another with Landis&#x27; business manager, Will Geoghegan, on May 16, 2007, the evening before LeMond appeared to testify. The major points of the testimony were:
*In the August 6 conversation, LeMond said he told Landis that &quot;If you did (admit to having used banned substances), you could single-handedly change the sport. You could be the one who will salvage the sport.&quot; LeMond said Landis responded by saying &quot;What good would it do? If I did, it would destroy a lot of my friends and hurt a lot of people.&quot;
* In their conversation, LeMond had disclosed his history of childhood sexual abuse to Landis and said the secret had nearly destroyed him. LeMond stated he warned Landis. &quot;(Lying about doping) will come back to haunt you when you are 40 or 50. If you have a moral compass and ethics, this will destroy you.&quot;
* Will Geoghegan attempted to stop LeMond&#x27;s testimony by calling LeMond on his mobile phone. LeMond reported that Geoghegan claimed he was &quot;his uncle&quot; and intimated that he would appear at the hearing and expose the fact that LeMond was a survivor of child sex abuse. LeMond&#x27;s BlackBerry, with Geoghegan&#x27;s phone number captured in the call log, was entered into evidence.

In 2007, Landis was found guilty of doping and was banned from cycling for two years. In 2010, he admitted to having been involved in doping. That same year, Landis apologized to LeMond for the events of 2007.

On July 23, 2009, LeMond wrote an opinion article in the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; where he questioned the validity of Alberto Contador&#x27;s climb up Verbier in the 2009 Tour de France. In the piece, LeMond pointed out that Contador&#x27;s calculated VO2 max of 99.5 mL/(kg·min) had never been achieved by any athlete. LeMond stated, &quot;The burden is then on Alberto Contador to prove he is physically capable of performing this feat without the use of performance-enhancing products.&quot; Contador tested positive for clenbuterol after winning the 2010 Tour and was later stripped of his title and suspended from cycling for two years.

LeMond has criticized the UCI and its former president, Pat McQuaid. In December 2012, LeMond claimed that a change needed to be made in the leadership for the UCI and stated if called upon he would be willing to take the position himself if necessary to lead cycling out of the mire of doping. Said LeMond: &quot;It is now or never to act. After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case another chance will not arise. I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic, transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term.&quot; McQuaid rejected LeMond&#x27;s call for new leadership and was dismissive of LeMond. Ultimately, McQuaid was defeated in his bid for a third term by British Cycling president Brian Cookson at the September 2013 UCI Congress in Florence, Italy. LeMond had supported Cookson in the UCI Presidential battle.

In an interview with Anderson Cooper in October 2013, LeMond was asked if Armstrong perpetrated the greatest fraud in the history of sports. LeMond stated:&quot;Absolutely. Absolutely. The greatest fraud was that -- I mean, I know his physical capability. He is a top 30 at best. I mean, at best. No matter what. If he was clean, everybody was clean, he was top 30 at best. He is not capable of, not -- capable of the top five.&quot;LeMond added, &quot;He manipulated the cancer community. I mean, I have family members with cancer. Everybody has been affected -- by cancer. But it was the manipulation and using that as -- a way to, like, it was like Teflon. He used the money, he used the foundation to -- not only cover for him but also destroy people.&quot; Cooper then asked LeMond what should happen to Armstrong before LeMond said that Armstrong should go to jail, and LeMond said, &quot;This is not a sporting infraction. This is criminal.&quot;

==Personal life==
LeMond is married to Kathy (née Morris) and they have three children together: Geoffrey, Scott, and Simone. LeMond and his wife lived in Medina, Minnesota, from 1990 until 2017 and then moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Since his retirement, LeMond has become increasingly involved in philanthropic efforts relating to causes that have affected him personally (including ADHD and sexual abuse). He is Catholic.

LeMond is an avid outdoor enthusiast and fly angler, and in 1991 – while still racing full-time – he made the world-record fly fishing catch of a four-pound smallmouth bass on a reel with a four-pound tippet. The record was certified by the National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame in Hayward, Wisconsin. The catch exceeded the then-previous record of three pounds, six ounces made on the same size tippet back in 1986. LeMond confessed, &quot;I always pack my fly fishing equipment when I travel to bike events. I fish every chance I get.&quot;

After retiring from pro cycling, LeMond competed in Formula Ford 2000 series auto racing. He is also a motivational speaker. LeMond narrated an award-winning documentary for Adventures for the Cure in 2008.

On July 16, 2007, LeMond rode the L&#x27;Étape du Tour cyclosportive with his son, and found it to be a defining moment in his post-competition life. &quot;I had the time of my life&quot;, he said, despite getting &quot;650th place&quot; and being &quot;impressed that I even finished&quot;. LeMond continued, &quot;I decided that day that nobody&#x27;s going to keep me from cycling, not Trek, not Armstrong, not Verbruggen, not anybody.&quot; At the time, LeMond was alluding to a series of public and private disputes related to his anti-doping advocacy that hampered his enjoyment of cycling. Especially significant was LeMond&#x27;s appearance as a USADA witness in the Floyd Landis doping case. At that time, Landis&#x27;s business manager threatened to expose the fact that LeMond was a survivor of child sex abuse.

Several weeks later, LeMond and his wife Kathy gave an extensive interview to Paul Kimmage of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. LeMond provided additional details concerning the circumstances of his 2001 apology to Armstrong, stating that Trek, the longtime manufacturer and distributor of LeMond Racing Cycles, had threatened to end the relationship at the behest of Armstrong if he did not apologize. LeMond described the two years following the apology as the worst in his life, marked by self-destructive behavior; ultimately, that behavior led LeMond to tell his wife that he was a survivor of child sex abuse and to seek help in addressing that past trauma. LeMond described how being a victim of molestation had impacted his life and his racing career. In September 2007, LeMond became a founding board member of the non-profit organization 1in6.org, whose mission is &quot;to help men who have had unwanted or abusive sexual experiences in childhood live healthy, happy lives&quot;.

LeMond was in a car accident on the morning of January 30, 2013. He lost control of his car while driving through wintery and icy conditions to his dentist in Wayzata, Minnesota. LeMond suffered a concussion and was left with no memory of the incident. According to Associated Press, a Plymouth police report says LeMond left the road, hit a fence and shrubs, and then hit an embankment before ending up in the backyard of a home. LeMond may have lost consciousness before the accident, according to his wife Kathy, and he suffered a compression fracture in his back and would have to wear a brace for three months. The accident curtailed LeMond&#x27;s public appearances in the first half of 2013, but he made a full recovery.

On September 19, 2019, the United States House of Representatives passed a bipartisan bill, submitted by California Representative Mike Thompson, to award LeMond the Congressional Gold Medal. The bill was approved by Congress on November 16, 2020, and signed by president Donald Trump on December 4. Upon signature of the bill, the White House released a statement, saying the medal was awarded to LeMond &quot;in recognition of his service to the Nation as an athlete, activist, role model, and community leader.&quot;

In June 2022, LeMond was diagnosed with non-life-threatening leukemia.

<text>Charles Brockden Brown (January 17, 1771 – February 22, 1810) was an American novelist, historian, and editor of the Early National period.

Brown is regarded by some scholars as the most important American novelist before James Fenimore Cooper. Although Brown was not the first American novelist, as some early criticism claimed, the breadth and complexity of his achievement as a writer in multiple genres (novels, short stories, essays and periodical writings, poetry, historiography, and reviews) makes him a crucial figure in literature of the early republic. His best-known works include &quot;Wieland&quot; and &quot;Edgar Huntly&quot;, both of which display his characteristic interest in Gothic themes. He has been referred to as the &quot;Father of the American Novel.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Brown was born on January 17, 1771, the fourth of five brothers and six surviving siblings in a Philadelphia Quaker merchant family. His father Elijah Brown, originally from Chester County, Pennsylvania, just southwest of Philadelphia, had a variable career primarily as a land-conveyancer or real estate agent. The two oldest brothers, Joseph and James, and youngest brother Elijah, Jr., were import-export merchants and bought shares in re-export ventures as early as the 1780s. Brown became a reluctant partner of their short-lived family firm, James Brown &amp; Co., from late 1800 to the firm&#x27;s dissolution in 1806. The third brother, Armitt, was a clerk in the early 1790s for the Treasury Department and at the Bank of Pennsylvania (for a time Armitt was a clerk with Alexander Hamilton), and later participated in the brothers&#x27; import-export firm. The family&#x27;s mercantile background and experiences in the global trade and trade conflicts of the Revolutionary era are relevant to Brown&#x27;s writings insofar as he often explored issues connected to the period&#x27;s culture of commerce and the role that commerce plays in the historical transition from 18th-century civic republicanism to 19th-century laissez-faire liberalism and capitalism.

Brown&#x27;s family intended for him to become a lawyer. After six years in Philadelphia at the law office of Alexander Wilcocks, he ended his law studies in 1793. He became part of a group of young, New York-based intellectuals who helped begin his literary career. The New York group included a number of young male professionals who called themselves the Friendly Club (including Dr. Elihu Hubbard Smith, Brown&#x27;s closest friend during this period, and William Dunlap), along with female friends and relatives who were interested in companionship and cultural-political conversation.

During most of the 1790s, Brown developed his literary ambitions in projects that often remained incomplete (for example the so-called &quot;Henrietta Letters,&quot; transcribed in the Clark biography) and frequently used his correspondence with friends as a laboratory for narrative experiments. His first publications appeared during the late 1780s (e.g. &quot;The Rhapsodist&quot; essay series from 1789), but he published little during this period. By 1798, however, these formative years gave way to a period of novel-writing during which Brown published his best known work. These novels and the rest of Brown&#x27;s career were informed by the progressive ideas he used and developed from the period&#x27;s British radical-democratic writers, most notably Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, Thomas Holcroft, and Robert Bage. Brown was influenced by these writers and in turn exerted an influence on them and their younger students, for example, in Godwin&#x27;s later novels, or in the work of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley, who reread Brown as she wrote her novels &quot;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&quot; (1818) and &quot;The Last Man&quot; (1826). The former was, according to his friend Peacock, heavily influenced in ‘the formation of his character’ from the depicted characters in Brown&#x27;s novels.

===Novels===
Between 1798 and late 1801, Brown published the Wollstonecraftian-feminist dialog &quot;Alcuin&quot; (1798) and seven subsequent novels. An additional novel was written, but was lost by a series of mishaps and never saw publication.

In addition to his novels, Brown also worked as an editor. Along with his friends in New York, he published and wrote many short articles and reviews for &quot;The Monthly Magazine and American Review&quot; from April 1799 to December 1800, as well as its short-lived successor, &quot;The American Review and Literary Journal&quot; (1801–1802). Finally, besides these two New York periodicals, Brown also published numerous pieces of fiction, including the only surviving fragment of his first novel &quot;Sky-Walk&quot;, in the Philadelphia-based &quot;Weekly Magazine of Original Essays, Fugitive Pieces, and Interesting Intelligence&quot; (1798–1799).

Brown&#x27;s novels are often characterized simply as &quot;Gothic fiction&quot;, although the model he develops is far from the Gothic romance mode of writers such as Ann Radcliffe. Brown&#x27;s novels combine several Revolutionary-era fiction subgenres with other types of late-Enlightenment scientific and medical knowledge. Most notably, they develop the British radical-democratic models of Wollstonecraft, Godwin, and Holcroft and combine these with elements of German &quot;Schauerromantik&quot; Gothic from Friedrich Schiller, the enlightened sentimental fictions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau or Laurence Sterne, women&#x27;s domestic novels by writers such as Fanny Burney or Hannah Webster Foster, and other genres such as the captivity narrative. Brown builds plots around particular motifs such as sleepwalking and religious mania, drawing on Enlightenment-era medical writings by people such as Erasmus Darwin.

Of the seven novels extant, the first four to be published in book form (&quot;Wieland&quot;, &quot;Ormond&quot;, &quot;Edgar Huntly&quot;, and &quot;Arthur Mervyn&quot;) have received the lion&#x27;s share of commentary and attention. Because of their sensational violence, dramatic intensity, and intellectual complexity, these four novels are often referred to as the &quot;Gothic&quot; or &quot;Godwinian&quot; novels. &quot;Stephen Calvert&quot;, which appeared only in serialized form and in the posthumous 1815 biography, remained little-read until the end of the 20th century, but is notable as the first U.S. novel to thematize same-sex sexuality. &quot;Clara Howard&quot; and &quot;Jane Talbot&quot; have been regarded sometimes as relatively conventional works distinct from the earlier novels because they have classic epistolary form and concern domestic issues that seem very different from the violence and sensationalism of the first four novels. Recent scholarship (since the 1980s), however, has largely revised this view and emphasizes the continuities and overall coherence of all seven novels understood as a loosely unified ensemble.

===Later life and writings===

After 1801 Brown continued to publish prolifically. He authored several important political pamphlets arguing for the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory and against the Embargo Act of 1807. He edited and was primary contributor to two more magazines: &quot;The Literary Magazine and American Register&quot; (1803–1806), a miscellany on cultural and other topics (from geography and medicine to history and aesthetics) and &quot;The American Register and General Repository of History, Politics, and Science&quot; (1807–09). The latter is notable for the book-length &quot;Annals of Europe and America,&quot; Brown&#x27;s contemporary historical narrative of Napoleonic geopolitics. Brown continued to write fiction and experiment with other literary genres during this period, notably in the &quot;Historical Sketches&quot;, a group of historical fictions that were written between 1803 and 1807 but published only posthumously. These late experimental narratives show Brown exploring the interface of fiction and history at the end of the Revolutionary era, at a moment that both follows the great Enlightenment historians (e.g., David Hume, William Robertson, Edward Gibbon) and prefigures the emergence of the 19th-century historical romance form in writers like Walter Scott or James Fenimore Cooper. He also published miscellaneous pieces in other Philadelphia newspapers and magazines of the 19th century including the &quot;Aurora&quot; and, in 1809, the &quot;Port-Folio&quot;.

In addition to these pamphlets, magazines, and historical narratives, it is notable that Brown maintained his contacts with reformist and progressive individuals and institutions in 19th-century Philadelphia. Although it was never completed, Brown planned from 1803 to 1806, with close friend Thomas Pym Cope, to publish a &quot;History of Slavery&quot; using the records of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. Benjamin Rush recommended Brown in 1803 as an ideal author for a history of penal reform in Philadelphia. Brown maintained a well-informed interest in these sorts of reformist institutions and since the early 1790s had regularly visited new, pioneering hospitals and prisons (such as Philadelphia&#x27;s Walnut Street Prison or Pennsylvania Hospital) with friends from his New York circle. In addition, he contracted to publish a major introduction to geography during his last years, but the manuscript is now lost. Politically, Brown has been an enigma, but more recent scholarship considers Brown as having, for instance, few or no associations with a Federalist political agenda and instead divorcing himself from the ideology of America as an exemplary nation, and desiring &quot;political justice&quot; on both sides of the Atlantic.

Brown died of tuberculosis in Philadelphia on February 22, 1810, at the age of 39. He was interred at the Arch Street Friends Meeting House Burial Ground in Philadelphia. A cenotaph was placed in his honor at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

==Reception history and critical reputation==
Although Brown&#x27;s writings did not achieve immediate commercial success, he was republished in both the U.S. and England throughout the Romantic era and developed a widespread and influential reputation as a &quot;writer&#x27;s writer.&quot; New editions of his works were published and reviewed widely in North America and England during the 1820s, for example, when Brown&#x27;s novels were also published in combined editions with those of Schiller and Mary Shelley. His novels were the first American novels translated into other European languages: &quot;Ormond&quot; was published in German (where it was attributed to Godwin) in 1803, and a French version of &quot;Wieland&quot; appeared in 1808. An abridged version of William Dunlap&#x27;s posthumous 1815 biography of him was also reprinted in England in 1822. The most important group of writers influenced by Brown during this period was the Godwin-Shelley circle mentioned above, but Brown was read and recommended by many other major British writers of this era, notably William Hazlitt, Thomas Love Peacock, John Keats, and Walter Scott. Among American writers, John Neal, Margaret Fuller, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and John Greenleaf Whittier were notable in regarding Brown as a particularly influential and significant predecessor. Neal in &quot;American Writers&quot; (1824–1825) contended that only Brown, himself, and James Kirke Paulding, had written anything that could be called authentically American literature. Philadelphia novelist and journalist George Lippard included a dedication to Brown in his 1845 bestseller &quot;The Quaker City, or The Monks of Monk Hall&quot;.

The contemporary era of interest in Brown begins with the publication of a modern scholarly edition of Brown&#x27;s novels, the six-volume Kent State &quot;Bicentennial Edition&quot; that was organized by Sydney J. Krause and S. W. Reid and appeared from 1977 to 1987. During the same period, new but still incomplete attempts to publish a selection of non-novelistic writings were initiated by German scholar Alfred Weber. Since the 1980s, new scholarship on both Brown and the early national period, accompanied by new mass market editions of Brown&#x27;s novels and increasing efforts to understand Brown&#x27;s entire career, has transformed the understanding of Brown&#x27;s writing and its place in American cultural history. Brown was regarded as a somewhat secondary novelist by scholars in the Cold War era who focused on normative aesthetic criteria and tended to ignore the wide scope of his writings, and their referential impact, but more recent and historically oriented scholarship has established Brown as a leading writer and intellectual of the late Enlightenment and early Republic. At the beginning of the 21st century, Brown is widely acknowledged as a key figure in American literary history whose writings provide insight into the major ideological, intellectual, and artistic struggles and transformations of the Atlantic revolutionary era, even if not as aesthetically rewarding as core works of the traditional American literary canon. Joyce Carol Oates calls Brown &quot;the first American novelist of substance&quot;. A Charles Brockden Brown Society, founded in 2000, has regular conferences on the work of Brown and his contemporaries.

In 2009, The Library of America selected Brown&#x27;s short story &quot;Somnambulism: A Fragment&quot; for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American Fantastic Tales, edited by Peter Straub. The Library also published &quot;Wieland&quot;, &quot;Arthur Mervyn&quot; and &quot;Edgar Huntly&quot; as &quot;Three Gothic Novels&quot; in a separate volume (first published in 1998), edited by Sydney J. Krause. The Library also included Brown&#x27;s poem, &quot;Monody, On the death of Gen. George Washington&quot;, in its volume of American poetry of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

The Charles Brockden Brown Electronic Archive and Scholarly Edition contains up-to-date scholarship on Brown&#x27;s life and writing as does &quot;The Oxford Handbook of Charles Brockden Brown&quot; (2019).

<text>Christopher Anstey (31 October 1724 – 3 August 1805) was an English poet who also wrote in Latin. After a period managing his family&#x27;s estates, he moved permanently to Bath and died after a long public life there. His poem, &quot;The New Bath Guide&quot;, brought him to fame and began an easy satirical fashion that was influential throughout the second half of the 18th century. Later he wrote &quot;An Electoral Ball&quot;, another burlesque of Bath society that allowed him to develop and update certain themes in his earlier work. Among his Latin writing were translations and summaries based on both these poems; he was also joint author of one of the earliest Latin translations of Gray&#x27;s &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot;, which went through several editions both in England and abroad.

==Life==
Anstey was the third child and only son of the Rev. Dr. Christopher Anstey, the rector of Brinkley in Cambridgeshire, and his wife Mary Thompson, born on 31 October 1724 in Trumpington. He was educated at Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he distinguished himself for his Latin verses. He became a fellow of his college in 1745 but the degree of M.A. was withheld from him in 1749 owing to his defiance of the university authorities and the offence caused by an address that is said to have begun &quot;Doctors without doctrine, artless masters of arts, and bachelors more worthy of the rod than the laurel...&quot; He joined the Middle Temple in 1746, but was not called to the bar.

In 1754, having succeeded to the prosperous family estates (including Anstey Hall in Trumpington), Anstey withdrew from the university. Two years later, he married Ann Calvert (1732–1812), daughter of Felix Calvert and the sister of his friend John Calvert of Albury Hall, Hertfordshire. For a considerable time Anstey lived the life of a country squire, cultivating letters as well as his estates, but publishing little of any note for many years. His family grew to include thirteen children, eight of whom survived him.

Following a period of depression aggravated by ill health after the death of a beloved sister in 1760, Anstey was advised to take the waters at the fashionable spa of Bath. Impressed by the place, he returned annually and decided to settle there permanently in 1770, his home being at No. 4 Royal Crescent for the next thirty-five years. In 1766, he achieved fame following the publication of &quot;The New Bath Guide: or Memoirs of the B__n__r__d Family in a series of Poetical Epistles&quot;, which went through some twenty editions before 1800. The work was enthusiastically praised for its gently satirical humour by such literary figures as Horace Walpole and Thomas Gray.

Later Anstey composed a work in the same vein, &quot;An Election Ball, in Poetical Letters from Mr Inkle at Bath to his Wife at Gloucester&quot;, published in 1776. The theme had been suggested to him at the literary gatherings of the Batheaston Literary Circle which he had been attending and to the last of whose regular anthologies he contributed. Other suggested themes occasioned published works of some length, but the connection did his reputation more damage than otherwise and was ended with the death of the coterie&#x27;s patroness, Anna, Lady Miller, in 1781. In the years that followed, he thought of collecting his poems for general publication but the project was only finally completed by his son John in 1808.

Although Anstey declared himself uninterested in public office, he had served as High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire for 1770–71, on the eve of his move to Bath. Once there, he busied himself in various philanthropic ventures, such as supporting the scheme for the support of the poor on behalf of which the Batheaston Circle&#x27;s &quot;Poetical Amusements&quot; were sold. In addition he served between 1781 and 1795 on the board of governors of Bath Hospital, for whom he wrote effective fund-raising poems. Later he supported the work of Hannah More, in whose series of Cheap Repository Tracts appeared his long ballad, &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter, a poetical tale&quot; (1795). His final Latin poem, the Alcaic stanzas addressed to Edward Jenner on his work on inoculation (1803), demonstrated the persistence of his humanitarian interests.

Anstey&#x27;s normally strong constitution gave way early in 1805. He died on 3 August, and was buried at St. Swithin&#x27;s Church in Walcot, Bath. Later a white marble memorial tablet was placed in the Poets&#x27; Corner of Westminster Abbey.

==Poetry==

===In Latin===
Poetry in Latin makes up only a quarter of Anstey&#x27;s published output, but his poetical career both began and ended with it. His first major work was a translation undertaken in collaboration with his friend William Hayward Roberts, also a Fellow at King&#x27;s College at the time, and published anonymously in 1762. This was &quot;Eligia Scripta in Coemeterio Rustico Latine reddita&quot;, a version of Thomas Gray&#x27;s already celebrated &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot; of 1751, on which they worked in consultation with the author himself.

Commenting on the draft sent him, Gray remarked that &quot;Every language has its idiom, not only of words and phrases, but of customs and manners, which cannot be represented in the tongue of another nation, especially of a nation so distant in time and place, without constraint and difficulty; of this sort, in the present instance, are the curfew bell, the Gothic Church, with its monuments, organs and anthems, the texts of Scripture, &amp;c. There are certain images, which, though drawn from common nature, and every where obvious, yet strike us as foreign to the turn and genius of Latin verse; the beetle that flies in the evening, to a Roman, I guess, would have appeared too mean an object for poetry.&quot; And further on he enquires, &quot;Might not the English characters here be romanized? Virgil is just as good as Milton, and Cæsar as Cromwell.&quot;

Gray&#x27;s stance was traditionalist and did not take account of the way Vincent Bourne&#x27;s poems had already demonstrated how Latin could be adapted to express contemporary reality. Preferring the latter&#x27;s approach, for the most part, Anstey&#x27;s version tries to remain faithful to Gray&#x27;s text and certainly retains the historical English names rather than making Roman substitutes. It was published anonymously in 1762 and was later to appear in the 1768 and 1775 Irish editions of Gray&#x27;s poems, along with an Italian and two other Latin versions of the Elegy. In 1778 there appeared an emended translation in which the introductory lines were signed C. A. et W. H. R. This was subsequently reprinted in Venice in 1794 and from there made its way into Alessandro Torri&#x27;s multilingual anthology of translations of the Elegy, published in Verona in 1817.

In later years Anstey went on to translate himself. First there was his version of &quot;Letter XIV&quot; from &quot;The New Bath Guide&quot;, that was only included in the posthumous collected edition of his work. This was a &#x27;humorous and whimsical&#x27; tour de force with both internal and end-rhymes, exactly fitting the spirit of the original. Secondly, there was the résumé of the themes in his later &quot;The Election Ball&quot; in a 1777 Latin epistle to its would-be illustrator Coplestone Warre Bampfylde, of which an English adaptation, &#x27;translated and addressed to the ladies&#x27;, appeared separately in the same year.
Anstey&#x27;s other translation during that time was of the fables of John Gay, undertaken originally for the guidance of his sons, whom he was preparing for entrance into Eton. This was published anonymously in a badly edited state, then subsequently revised for a new edition in 1798. However, reviewers complained of its rigid metres and &#x27;diffusion extended into weakness&#x27; as being badly fitted to the sprightly octosyllabics of Gay&#x27;s original. It had too much of the schoolroom about it.

===In English===
Anstey was principally known for his long epistolary poem, &quot;The New Bath Guide&quot;. He never quite recaptured the success of that work, which was continuously in print throughout his lifetime, although he returned to humorous depiction of the same Bath types in such works as &quot;An Election Ball&quot; and &quot;The Decayed Macaroni&quot;. Finding little to admire in such sequels, Horace Walpole judged that Anstey &quot;ought to have shot himself the moment he had finished the Bath Guide&quot;, but others since have seen more to respect.
Gray described the Guide as having &quot;a new and original kind of humour&quot;, although in terms of the Classical models of his time it could be described as satire on the good-natured Horatian model. The alternative sharp Juvenilian style of the recently deceased satirist Charles Churchill was not for him. Indeed, in an unfinished poem preserved by his son, he had declared himself

Instead he made his subject matter the familiar follies of the landed squirearchy in a poem that, &quot;while it includes a number of particular and topical Bath references to give the flavour of the place and time, has sufficient scope and is written from enough of a detached viewpoint to make its critique of manners and morals of enduring application.&quot; The work&#x27;s eventual frontispiece clarifies Anstey’s good-natured aim. Pictured there is a procession of the fashionable headed by a monkey and a Momus clown with, in leash, the fashionable crowd they lead by the nose.

Commenting on the appearance of the Guide, published far away in Cambridge on the other side of the country by an unknown author, his son later marvelled that &quot;It was hardly possible that a work of this description...could have made its appearance under circumstances of greater disadvantage.&quot; The title was an added hindrance at first, since the third edition of the official city guide, now titled &quot;The New Bath Guide or useful pocket companion&quot;, had been published in 1765, the year before Anstey&#x27;s work. Though it provided a useful point of reference to readers, repeated editions of the pocket companion, &#x27;corrected and much enlarged&#x27;, continued to sow confusion for as long as the two books continued to appear.

The Guide relates the misadventures of the three naïve children of a Northern squire, as reported by them over the course of fifteen letters to friends and parents, and incidentally give a comic picture of life in the spa. In a far departure from the Augustan manner common until then, the style is colloquial and written in loose anapaestic tetrameters, later to be characterised as the &quot;Anstey measure&quot; or &quot;Bath-guide verse&quot;.

The inventiveness of the rhymes and the puns on the ridiculous names given to the characters adds further humour here.

Such naming, an aspect of the work which was widely admired, derives from theatrical practice at the time and gives a clue to the person&#x27;s character, but in the case of the main protagonists there is added irony too. Their Blunderhead surname not only sums up the various meanings of the word &#x27;blunder&#x27; in their behaviour but has the overtones of stupidity contained in the colloquial &#x27;dunderhead&#x27; as well. This is further emphasised in the son&#x27;s first name, Simkin, which is a dialect expression denoting a simpleton. The behaviour of his sister Prudence, on the other hand, is at variance with her name. She most imprudently allows herself to be seduced by a Methodist imposter with the expressive name of Roger, the slang meaning of which is sexual intercourse, while in dialect it refers to a tricky person.
The broad 18th century humour of the Guide inevitably met with criticism in some quarters. While the parodies and allusions to Milton, Dryden and the Classical authors were well received, the perversion of Methodist terminology in Prudence&#x27;s account of her seduction at least caused controversy. To dispel some of this, the second edition contained an epilogue which added considerably to the book&#x27;s length but light-heartedly tried to meet some of the objections. Nevertheless, a comment at the start of the more prudish 19th century concerning &quot;those violations of decency which disgust us in the New Bath Guide&quot; indicates that they were not forgotten.
When Anstey returned to a burlesque of Bath society a decade later in &quot;An Electoral Ball&quot;, it allowed him to embroider on some of his earlier themes. Thus Simkin&#x27;s shocked account of female hairdressing in &quot;Letter XII&quot; of the Guide was expanded to outright farce in &quot;An Election Ball&quot; and had an immediate effect. In Samuel Hoare&#x27;s conversation piece portrait of him (see above), his daughter is shown trying to draw his attention to the extravagant doll in her hand, in reality the kind of lay figure sent from Paris to guide dressmakers in the latest styles. Though she seems to distract him from composition, she is also serving as muse, for the doll&#x27;s fantastic hairstyle is just such as, judging from the pattern of lines on his manuscript, Anstey went on to describe in the poem: &quot;To a cap like a bat / (Which was once my cravat) / Part gracefully patted and pinn&#x27;d is, / Part stuck upon gauze/ Resembles mackaws/ And all the fine birds of the Indies.&quot;

It was this episode too, featuring Madge Inkle as she confects a hair ornament from the purloined tail feathers of the rooster, that Anstey&#x27;s friend Coplestone Warre Bampfylde chose as the first scene to illustrate in &quot;An Election Ball&quot;. Arriving too late for inclusion in the revised edition of 1776, they were first used instead in the Latin epistle that Anstey addressed to Bampfylde, including mention of all the scenes the artist had chosen to picture.

==Literary influence==
===18th century===
Anstey was an innovator in more ways than one. He was the first to make tourism a poetic subject since the pilgrimage depicted by Thomas Chaucer in his Canterbury Tales. The epistolary mode which Anstey chose for his characters allowed their different voices to be distinguished in the same way as Chaucer&#x27;s were through their narratives. But at the same time, the relaxed anapaestic measure united within it the work&#x27;s impressionistic diversity.

Added evidence of the way that Anstey&#x27;s social comedy had captured the general imagination is given by the large number of imitations that followed its publication. They were of several kinds, however, and at first were directly dependent on &quot;The New Bath Guide&quot; for their context, the earliest being the complimentary &quot;Poetical Epistles to the author of the New Bath Guide&quot; (London, 1767). It was followed by a youthful imitation of Anstey&#x27;s manner by Richard Brinsley Sheridan, first published in &quot;The Bath Chronicle&quot; as a satirical account of the opening ball at the New Assembly Rooms in 1771. The convoluted title of this occasional piece was &quot;The Ridotto of Bath, a Panegyrick written by a Gentleman, resident in that City: Being an Epistle from Timothy Screw, Under Server to Messrs Kuhf and Fitzwater, to his brother Henry, Waiter at Almack&#x27;s&quot; and was dependent on Anstey&#x27;s work in several particulars. Another close imitation was &quot;The Register of Folly, or characters and incidents at Bath&quot;, containing twelve poetical epistles &#x27;by an invalid&#x27; (London 1773).

Anstey&#x27;s &quot;An Election Ball&quot; (1776) and its reporting in three letters is not only an imitation of his own manner in the New Bath Guide but takes further Sheridan&#x27;s later ballroom satire. Created initially for the amusement of the Batheaston set, it also flattered the town in general by its use of local references. Much later there came another derivative reference to the Guide itself in John Williams&#x27; &quot;A Postscript to the New Bath Guide by Anthony Pasquin&quot; (1790).

But other health resorts than Bath were coming into vogue, and to these Anstey&#x27;s manner began to be applied by other authors, one of the earliest being the &quot;Tunbridge Epistles from Lady Margaret to the Countess of B&quot;, mentioned in &quot;The Monthly Review&quot; for May 1767. Although the majority of such works lacked the charm of novelty, and often attracted scornful reviews, George Dallas at least made his name with an exotic adaptation. This was &quot;The India Guide, or Journal of a Voyage to the East Indies in the Year 1780: In a Poetical Epistle to Her Mother by Emily Brittle&quot; (Calcutta 1785), which he dedicated to Anstey.

As the new fad of sea-bathing replaced the hot springs at Bath, the pseudonymous Anthony Pasquin now found the success that eluded him with his &quot;Postscript to the New Bath Guide&quot; by bringing Anstey’s title up to date with &quot;The new Brighton guide, or companion for young ladies and gentlemen to all the watering-places in Great Britain: with notes, historical, moral, and personal&quot; (1796). It immediately became a best-seller, but in succeeding editions the main emphasis was redirected to satire of the Prince Regent, who had favoured Brighton as a resort. With that came an alteration of the poem&#x27;s title to &quot;The New Brighton Guide; Involving a Complete, Authentic, and Honourable Solution of the Recent Mysteries of Carlton House&quot; that promised &quot;Momentous Alterations and Additions&quot;. The work consisted of a series of epistles – moral, sentimental, serious and didactic – between the Royal Pavilion and the Regent’s associated London residences.

In the following year an anonymous work featured the alternative health resort of Ramsgate in &quot;The Sea-Side, a Poem, in Familiar Epistles from Mr Simkin Slenderwit Summerising at Ramsgate, to His Dear Mother in Town&quot; (1797). Richard Scrafton Sharpe (c. 1780 -1852) chose a nearby town for his imitation, &quot;The Margate new guide; or memoirs of five families out of six Who, in Town discontent with a good Situation, Make Margate the Place of their Summer Migration&quot; (1799). It too deployed Anstey&#x27;s almost obligatory jogtrot rhythm in what a contemporary review summed up as &quot;ten letters, humorously describing in lively verse the usual diversions of that place and the company who resort to it.&quot; Another reviewer, however, found it poorer by comparison with &quot;The New Bath Guide&quot;.

Several more authors had rushed in where Anstey had feared to tread and adapted his style, and even his characters, to political themes. They include Ralph Broome&#x27;s &quot;The Letters of Simkin the Second, poetic recorder of all the proceedings upon the trial of Warren Hastings&quot; (London 1789); followed by &quot;The New Parliamentary Register in a series of poetical epistles&quot; (1791), which was dedicated to Anstey and featured Simkin as a newly elected Member of Parliament.

===19th century===

The trend of adaptations of Anstey’s manner to other themes extended into the nineteenth century. In the political sphere there was George Watson-Taylor&#x27;s &quot;The Cross-Bath Guide, being the Correspondence of a Respectable Family upon the subject of a late unexpected Dispensation of Honours&quot; (1815), although a reviewer found that &quot;the imitation is not quite the equal, in point of wit, to the original&quot; model by Anstey. There were also surveys of newly developing resort towns: by Barbara Hofland in &quot;A Season in Harrogate, in a series of poetical epistles by Benjamin Blunderhead Esquire to his mother in Derbyshire&quot; (1812) and by William Henry Halpin in &quot;The Cheltenham Mailbag: or letters from Gloucestershire, edited by Peter Quince the Younger&quot; (1820).

Meanwhile Bath was again becoming fashionable as a spa town, a development underlined by the arrival of Queen Charlotte in 1817, leading a royal party. The place had been newly celebrated already in John Cam Hobhouse&#x27;s &quot;The Wonders of a Week in Bath in a doggerel address&quot; in 1811. That poem was followed a few years later by two linked works: &quot;Rough Sketches of Bath by Q in the Corner&quot; (Bath 1817), described by a later critic as &quot;little else than clever imitations of Anstey&quot;, and by &quot;Epistles from Bath, or Q’s letters to his Yorkshire relations&quot; (1817). Though these were published anonymously at the time, Thomas Haynes Bayly eventually identified himself as &quot;Q&quot; (and his target as Anstey) in a &quot;Pastoral Duet between Robert Montgomery and Thomas Haynes Bayly&quot;, published in Fraser&#x27;s Magazine:
:I sang about Bath till I bothered them really,
:And eclipsed was Kit Anstey by Thomas Haynes Bayly.

Imitative works were now being extended into series as their authors sought to outdo their predecessors. A further anonymous collection of letters in Anstey measure appeared as &quot;A Summer in Bath&quot; in 1822, but quoting Bayly at the start by way of &quot;Advertisement&quot;. However, Thomas Moore&#x27;s &quot;The Fudge Family in Paris&quot; (1818) marked an original departure and provided a more successful model for satirical imitation. Moore&#x27;s work brought Anstey&#x27;s manner up to date and widened its scope. Four family members visit the completely different setting of Paris after the Bourbon restoration. Their various characters and points of view are reflected in more varied verse measures, in which the anapaestics of the family’s younger generation contrast with the iambics of their elders, and the politics treated are those that followed the Congress of Vienna. Just as important for the more straight-laced audience of the time, the love interest provided by Biddy Fudge and her suitor replaces with farcical social satire the coarseness once deplored in Anstey&#x27;s treatment of Prudence Blunderhead. Later imitations were to transfer relatives of the Fudge family to the Scottish and American capitals and to Ireland (1822). Then a French Fudge turns the tables by visiting the English capital and describing life there to his exiled relative in France.

At the decade&#x27;s end, an inhabitant of Bath, refusing to be dazzled by the recent tourist preference for capital cities, called the strayed brood of imitators to heel with &quot;Eight Letters from Bath by the Fidget Family&quot; (Bath, 1830) in impeccable Anstey measure. Nor was it until 1835 that the harassed and impecunious Moore could himself get round, much too late, to writing his own sequel, &quot;The Fudges in England&quot;. That too was set, according to its preface, in &quot;a well-known fashionable watering place&quot;. But though the work sold well, the critical response was muted. &quot;Mr Moore’s poetical &quot;rabies&quot; is incurable&quot; commented the reviewer of &quot;The Dublin University Magazine&quot;. A modern judgment, comparing Moore&#x27;s original work and its sequel, finds that while &quot;in the first Fudge saga, the influence of Anstey is less evident&quot;, the story line of the second is much more derivative. In any case, writers seem to have decided by now that enough was enough and no further imitations of Anstey followed.

===20th century===
A later tribute came from John Betjeman in 1973. As a trustee of the Bath Preservation Trust since the 1940s, he protested the depredations of philistine developers in &quot;The Newest Bath Guide&quot;, quoting from and addressing Anstey. Its final couplet demonstrates how much Betjeman was indebted to him for his own art of satirical rhyming:
::Goodbye to old Bath! We who loved you are sorry
::They&#x27;re carting you off by developer&#x27;s lorry.

<doc id="275279" wikidata="Q2595492" url="?curid=275279" title="Thomas Ellwood">
<text>Thomas Ellwood (October 1639 – 1 March 1714) was an English religious writer. He is remembered for his relationship with poet John Milton, and some of his writing has proved durable as well.

==Life==
Ellwood was born in the village of Crowell, Oxfordshire, the son of a rural squire, Walter Ellwood, by his wife, Elizabeth Potman. From 1642 to 1646 the family lived in London. He was educated at Lord Williams&#x27;s School in Thame.

Ellwood became a Quaker after visiting Isaac Penington and his family at Chalfont St. Peter in Buckinghamshire. Penington&#x27;s wife, Mary, widow of Sir William Springett, had known the Ellwoods while they lived in London. On a second visit in December 1659, when Thomas attended a Quaker meeting at a neighbouring farmhouse and made the acquaintance of Edward Burrough and James Nayler. Burrough&#x27;s preaching impressed Ellwood, and after attending a second meeting at High Wycombe he joined the new sect and adopted their modes of dress and speech. His father resented his son&#x27;s conversion, thrashed him for wearing his hat in his presence, and kept him confined in the house through the winter of 1660. Neither blows nor persuasion could induce Ellwood to renounce his new sentiments, to take off his hat before his parents, or to address them with other pronouns than &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;thee.&quot; At Easter, the Peningtons managed to move him to Chalfont St. Peter, where he stayed till Whitsuntide. He attended meetings with great assiduity.

In 1660 Ellwood was divinely inspired, according to his own account, to write and print an attack on the established clergy entitled &quot;An Alarm to the Priests&quot;. He later visited London and met George Fox the younger. About November 1660 Ellwood invited a Quaker from Oxford named Thomas Loe to attend a meeting at Crowell. Loe was at the time in prison in Oxford Castle, and Ellwood&#x27;s letter fell into the hands of Lord Falkland, lord-lieutenant of the county. A party of horse was sent to arrest him: he was taken before two justices of the peace at Weston, refused to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, and was imprisoned for some months at Oxford in the house of the city marshal, a linendraper in High Street named Galloway. His father secured his release and tried to keep him from Quaker meetings.

In April 1661 the elder Ellwood and his two daughters left Crowell to live in London; Thomas Ellwood then sold the beasts on the Crowell farm at his father&#x27;s directions and dismissed the servants. For a time he lived in complete solitude. He often visited Aylesbury gaol, where many of his Quaker friends were in prison. At a Quaker meeting held at Penington&#x27;s house he was, for a second time, arrested, but was soon discharged. For no apparent reason he was immediately afterwards arrested as a rogue and vagabond by the watch at Beaconsfield while walking home from Chalfont St. Peters, but was released after one night&#x27;s detention.

Early in 1662 Ellwood was attacked by smallpox, and on his recovery went to London to study. His friend Penington consulted Dr. Paget, who arranged that he should read with the poet John Milton, now completely blind. Ellwood lodged in Aldersgate nearby Milton&#x27;s house, and read in Latin to him. After six-week Ellwood fell ill, went to Wycombe to recuperate, and returned in October 1662. That month he was arrested again, and was committed to Newgate Prison in December. His plea of illegal detention was over-ruled. He was moved to Bridewell, and released in January. Then till 1669 Ellwood resided with the Peningtons as Latin tutor to their young children, and he managed their estates in Kent and Sussex. He agreed to the sale of Crowell by his father, and acquired some ready money.

In June 1665 Ellwood hired a cottage for Milton at Chalfont St. Giles, where the poet lived during the Great Plague of London. On 1 July he was arrested while attending a funeral at Amersham, and spent a month in Aylesbury gaol. On his discharge he paid Milton a visit, and was lent the manuscript of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;; Ellwood asked &quot;what hast thou to say of &quot;Paradise Found&quot;&quot;? When Ellwood called on Milton in London in the autumn, he was shown &quot;Paradise Regained&quot;. Pennington was in prison at Aylesbury for nine months during 1665 and 1666; his household was broken up, and Ellwood stayed with his pupils at Aylesbury, Bristol, and Amersham. From 13 March 1685-6 till 25 June Ellwood was himself imprisoned once again at Wycombe for attending a meeting at Hedgerley, Buckinghamshire.

Ellwood married Mary Ellis in 1669 and lived in Coleshill, Hertfordshire. His close friendship with William Penn and George Fox made him an influential figure in the Quaker movement: Penn married his friend Gulielma Pennington. In 1668 he lent assistance to George Fox in his attempt to crush John Perrot, leader of a body of Quaker dissenters who insisted on wearing their hats during worship, and he travelled with Fox through the west of England on an organising expedition. In 1670 he was present at the debate at High Wycombe between Jeremy Ives, a Baptist, and William Penn. When the Conventicle Act became law in July 1670, and the Quakers were at the mercy of corrupt informers, Ellwood against two named Aris and Lacy for perjury. In 1674 he was engaged in a controversy with Thomas Hicks, a Baptist, who had written against Quakerism. He also wrote much against tithes from 1678 onwards, and attacked William Rogers, who in 1682 ignored the authority of Penn and Fox, and denied their right to control the Quaker community.

Ellwood&#x27;s account of his own life stopped in July 1683, when he was protesting against the injustice of treating Quaker meetings as riotous assemblies. He had just been threatened with prosecution for seditious libel because he had warned the constables to beware of informers. This was in the wake of the Rye House Plot, and his work &quot;A Caution to Constables&quot; had brought attention to him.

His father died about 1684 at Holton, and Ellwood was charged by his enemies with absenting himself from his funeral. But he behaved dutifully, according to his own account, to the last. He lived in retirement at Amersham for the greater part of his remaining years, writing constantly against internal divisions in the Quaker ranks, and denouncing in 1684 the heresy of George Keith. In 1690 he edited the journal of his friend, George Fox, and was long engaged on a history of the Old Testament. In 1707 and 1708 distraints were levied on him for the non-payment of tithes. His wife died in April 1708, and he himself died 1 March 1714, at his house, Hunger Hill, Amersham. Both were buried in the Friends&#x27; burying-place at New Jordan, Chalfont St. Giles.

==Works==
Ellwood was the author of several polemical works in defence of the Quaker position, of which &quot;Forgery no Christianity&quot; (1674), The Foundation of Tithes Shaken (1678) and two tracts attacking Thomas Hicks deserve mention. His &quot;Sacred Histories of the Old and New Testaments&quot; appeared in 1705 and 1709. He also published some volumes of poems, among them his best-known work, &quot;Davideis&quot; (1712), a poem in five books about the life of King David. His autobiography, &quot;The History of the Life of Thomas Ellwood: written by his own hand&quot;, published posthumously, is a valuable historical document. It has been in print almost continuously since 1714.

==Ecology==
&quot;Lathyrus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the grey chi (&quot;Antitype chi&quot;) and the latticed heath (&quot;Chiasmia clathrata&quot;), both recorded on meadow vetchling (&quot;Lathyrus pratensis&quot;), and &quot;Chionodes braunella&quot;. &quot;Lathyrus&quot; growth abundance and size both decrease in response to increased temperatures in montane meadows.

== Uses ==
Several species are grown for food, including the pea (&quot;Lathyrus oleraceus&quot;), Indian pea (&quot;L. sativus&quot;), and the red pea (&quot;L. cicera&quot;), and less commonly cyprus-vetch (&quot;L. ochrus&quot;) and Spanish vetchling (&quot;L. clymenum&quot;). The tuberous pea (&quot;L. tuberosus&quot;) is grown as a root vegetable for its starchy edible tuber. The seeds of some &quot;Lathyrus&quot; species contain the toxic amino acid oxalyldiaminopropionic acid and if eaten in large quantities can cause lathyrism, a serious disease.

Many species are cultivated as garden plants. The genus includes the garden sweet pea (&quot;Lathyrus odoratus&quot;) and the perennial everlasting pea (&quot;Lathyrus latifolius&quot;). Flowers on these cultivated species may be rose, red, maroon, pink, white, yellow, purple or blue, and some are bicolored. They are also grown for their fragrance. Cultivated species are susceptible to fungal infections including downy and powdery mildew.

<text>David Mallet (or Malloch) ( 1705–1765) was a Scottish poet and dramatist.

He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, and went to London in 1723 to work as a private tutor. There he became friendly with Alexander Pope, James Thomson, and other literary figures including Henry St John, Viscount Bolingbroke.

His best-known work was written in the same year: &quot;William and Margaret&quot;, adapted from a traditional ballad. In 1740, he collaborated with Thomson on a masque, &quot;Alfred&quot;, which was the vehicle for &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;. His other plays and poetry (e.g. &quot;Amyntor and Theodora&quot;), popular at the time, are largely forgotten, but Bolingbroke&#x27;s writings were edited and published by Mallet in 1754.

==Life==
Mallet was probably the second son of James Malloch of Dunruchan, a well-to-do tenant farmer on Lord Drummond&#x27;s Perthshire estate, a Roman Catholic, and a member of the outlawed Clan MacGregor. The household suffered during the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715. Mallet gave his age as 28 in 1733, and was therefore born about 1705. He seems to have been educated at the parish school of Crieff under John Ker.

In 1717 Mallet was acting as janitor in Edinburgh High School. In 1720 he became resident tutor to the sons of Mr. Home of Dreghorn; he held the post till 1723, studied at the same time at the University of Edinburgh (1721–2, 1722–3), and formed a friendship with a fellow student, James Thomson the poet, a future collaborator. In July 1723 he accepted the post of tutor to the sons of the Duke of Montrose. Leaving the university without a degree, he went in August to London, and then to the duke&#x27;s seat at Shawford, near Winchester. He lived with the family until 1731, mainly in London and Shawford. In 1726 he received the honorary degree of M.A. from the University of Aberdeen, ostensibly for an English poem in imitation of Ker&#x27;s &quot;Donaides&quot;. Early in 1727 he made a continental tour with his pupils. Towards the end of 1731 he left the Montrose family, and went to Gosfield in Essex, to act as tutor to the stepson of John Knight, to whose wife, formerly Mrs. Newsham, he had been recommended by Alexander Pope.

On 2 November 1733 Mallet, with his pupil, matriculated at St. Mary Hall, Oxford, where he resided fairly regularly till 27 September 1734. On 5 March 1735 he received, at his request, the degree of M.A. from the University of Edinburgh, and on the 15th of that month he graduated B.A., and on 6 April M.A. of the University of Oxford. He was again abroad in 1735.

Mallet came into favour with the opposition, and was appointed, 27 May 1742, under-secretary to the Prince of Wales. In 1745 he made a tour in Holland.

Mallet was rewarded in 1763 by Lord Bute, to whom he had given fulsome praise, with the post of inspector of exchequer-book in the outports of London, a sinecure which he held till his death. In the autumn of the following year he joined his wife Lucy in Paris, but ill health compelled him to return to London. He died on Sunday, 21 April 1765 and was buried on 27 April in St. George&#x27;s cemetery, South Audley Street.

==Works==
Mallet published a &quot;Pastoral&quot; in the &quot;Edinburgh Miscellany&quot; in 1720; and during his college days produced a number of short pieces, including an imitation of John Milton entitled &quot;The Transfiguration&quot;, first published in the &quot;Edinburgh Magazine&quot; in 1793. Shortly before his engagement with the Montrose family he composed the ballad of &quot;William and Margaret&quot; which was published first anonymously in black letter, and then in 1724, in Allan Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;Tea-Table Miscellany&quot;, and Aaron Hill&#x27;s &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; No. 36. Further poems followed, mostly written for John Ker; and in February 1725 he wrote verses on &quot;Mira&quot;, the &quot;Clio&quot; of his friend Thomson. For Thomson&#x27;s poem on &quot;Winter&quot;, published in March 1726, he wrote a dedication to Sir Spencer Compton, and some verses for the second edition He had himself written, early in 1725, a poem on the same subject, which was praised by Thomson; and on his return from the continent he prepared for the press &quot;The Excursion&quot;, in two books, which he had written in 1726.
On 22 February 1731 Mallet produced his tragedy of &quot;Eurydice&quot; at Drury Lane, with a prologue and epilogue by Aaron Hill. It was acted about thirteen times, and was revived in 1759. Mallet showed his appreciation for Pope with his poem on &quot;Verbal Criticism&quot; (1733), in which he ridiculed Lewis Theobald.

Mallet made more of a reputation with the tragedy of &quot;Mustapha&quot;, produced at Drury Lane on 13 Feb. 1738–9. The prologue was by Thomson, and the play was dedicated to Frederick, Prince of Wales: like Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Edward and Eleonora&quot;, but less openly, it was directed against the king and Sir Robert Walpole. With James Quin as Solyman, it ran for fourteen nights. In 1740 Mallet published a short &quot;Life of Bacon&quot;; shortly afterwards Mallet and Thomson were commanded by the Prince to write the masque of &quot;Alfred&quot;, to celebrate both the birthday of the Princess Augusta and the anniversary of George I&#x27;s accession. It was played in the gardens of Cliefden, before the Prince and Princess of Wales, on Friday, 1 August 1740, with Quin, Christiana Horton, and Kitty Clive in the leading parts.

Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough left in 1744 the sum of £1,000 to Mallet and Richard Glover, to write a life of her husband; and Mallet, on Glover&#x27;s refusal, undertook the work. He only did some research. He published, in May 1747, &#x27;Amyntor and Theodora, or the Hermit.&#x27;

Mallet and Thomson had, through George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton, support from the Prince of Wales, but then lost it as Lyttelton fell from favour. Mallet then found the patronage of Bolingbroke, and prepared a new edition of the &quot;Patriot King&quot;, published in 1749; in it he attacked the memory of Pope for having clandestinely edited and printed the work in 1738. There was a short pamphlet war with Pope&#x27;s friends. He then edited Bolingbroke&#x27;s works, 5 vols. in March 1754. Samuel Johnson remarked on this enterprise that Bolingbroke had &quot;spent his life in charging a gun against Christianity&quot;, and &quot;left half-a-crown to a hungry Scotchman to draw the trigger after his death&quot;.

In 1751, three years after the death of Thomson, Mallet published a new version of the masque of 1740. The adaptation was major, with new scenes and songs added. It was acted at Drury Lane on 23 February 1751, with David Garrick in the title rôle. The masque of &quot;Britannia&quot;, an appeal to patriotic sentiment on the eve of an outbreak of war with France, followed in 1755. It was produced at Drury Lane on 9 May, when Garrick spoke the prologue as a drunken sailor.

On 19 January 1763 Mallet&#x27;s &quot;Elvira&quot; was acted at the same venue during the &quot;half-price riots&quot;. Garrick took the part of Don Pedro, the last original character in which he was seen; but it provoked a pamphlet of &quot;Critical Strictures&quot; by James Boswell and two fellow Scots. In the intervening years Mallet had written lesser works, including the ballad of &quot;Edwin and Emma&quot; (1760), and a partisan indictment by a &quot;Plain Man&quot; against Admiral Byng in 1757. An extract from his &quot;The tragedy of Bowes&quot; appears in &quot;The Bishoprick Garland 1834&quot; by Cuthbert Sharp.

&quot;Felis lynx&quot; was the scientific name used in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus in his work &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the following Eurasian lynx subspecies were proposed:

The following were also proposed, but are not considered valid taxa:
*Altai lynx (&quot;L. l. wardi&quot;) 
*Baikal lynx (&quot;L. l. kozlovi&quot;) 
*Amur lynx (&quot;L. l. stroganovi&quot;) 
*Sardinian lynx (&quot;L. l. sardiniae&quot;) 

== Characteristics ==
The Eurasian lynx has a relatively short, reddish or brown coat that is marked with black spots; their number and pattern are highly variable. The underparts, neck and chin are whitish. The fur is more brightly coloured with more numerous spots in animals living at the southern end of its range. In winter, it is much thicker and varies from silver-grey to greyish brown. Some animals have dark brown stripes on the forehead and back. It has powerful, relatively long legs, with large webbed and furred paws that act like snowshoes. It also has a short &quot;bobbed&quot; tail with an all-black tip, black tufts of hair on its ears, and a long grey-and-white ruff.

It is the largest of the four lynx species, ranging in body length from in males; in females; and standing at the shoulder. The tail is long, constituting a total length of up to in the largest males. Weights of both sexes in Russia range from , but more than is attained very rarely and is possibly exaggerated. A Eurasian lynx from the Altai Mountains allegedly weighed . Those inhabiting Fennoscandia and westwards are considerably smaller, with a range of just , though individuals in the Carpathian Mountains may rival those in the Altai in size.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Eurasian lynx inhabits rugged country providing plenty of hideouts and stalking opportunities. Depending on the locality, this may include rocky-steppe, mixed forest-steppe, boreal forest, and montane forest ecosystems. In the more mountainous parts of its range, Eurasian lynx descends to the lowlands in winter, following prey species and avoiding deep snow. Despite its adaptations for moving in snow, it finds loose, deep snow difficult to deal with and cannot survive in areas with snow depths exceeding . It tends to be less common where the grey wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;) is abundant, and wolves have been reported to attack and even eat lynx.

=== Europe ===
The Eurasian lynx was once widespread throughout most of continental Europe. By the early 19th century, it was persecuted to local extinction in western and southern European lowlands, but survived only in mountainous areas and Scandinavian forests. By the 1950s, it had become extinct in most of Western and Central Europe, where only scattered and isolated populations exist today.

==== Fennoscandia ====
The Eurasian lynx was close to extinction in Scandinavia in the 1930s. Since the 1950s, the population slowly recovered and forms three subpopulations in northern, central and southern Scandinavia.
In Norway, the Eurasian lynx was subjected to an official bounty between 1846 and 1980 and could be hunted without license. In 1994, a compensation scheme for livestock killed by lynx was introduced. By 1996, the lynx population was estimated to comprise 410 individuals, decreased to fewer than 260 individuals in 2004 and increased since 2005 to about 452 mature individuals by 2008.

In Sweden, the lynx population was estimated at 1,400 individuals in 2006 and 1,250 in 2011. Hunting is controlled by government agencies.
In Finland, about 2,200–2,300 individuals were present according to a 2009 estimate. The lynx population in Finland has been increasing every year since 1991, and is estimated to be nowadays larger than ever before. Limited hunting is permitted. In 2009 the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry gave a permit for hunting of 340 lynx individuals.

==== Western Europe ====

In Great Britain, subfossil remains of Eurasian lynx have been dated to the early Middle Ages, and the 7th or 8th century Welsh poem Dinogad&#x27;s Smock likely makes reference to the presence of lynx in Cumbria. It is possible that other Medieval and Modern era references to &quot;wild cats&quot; and &quot;cats of the mountain&quot;, as late as the 18th century, actually refer to Eurasian lynx and not the Scottish wildcat as is commonly assumed. It has been proposed to reintroduce the lynx to the Scottish Highlands and Kielder Forest in Northumberland. In January 2025, several lynxes were illegally released near Kingussie in the Cairngorms National Park; they were captured by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and taken to the Highland Wildlife Park and subsequently to Edinburgh Zoo.

A large lynx that hunted deer and livestock, sometimes called &quot;tiger&quot; and &quot;deer&#x27;s wolf&quot; (&quot;llobu/lobo cerval&quot;), was also reported in Green Spain until the 19th century. These accounts were traditionally regarded as references to Iberian lynx (&quot;Lynx pardinus&quot;), a smaller endemic species of the Iberian Peninsula. However, genetic testing of remains showed that the Eurasian and Iberian lynx coexisted into recent times in the Iberian Peninsula with little overlap, the Eurasian lynx being present in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests and the Iberian lynx in Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub. The Eurasian lynx of Spain was a unique, extinct lineage more related to the Carpathian and Baltic subspecies. It was genetically impoverished already in pre-Roman times, possibly because of founder effect, which made it even more vulnerable to human persecution. The government of Asturias studied the feasibility of Eurasian lynx reintroduction in 2019. In the Catalonian Pyrenees, the last Eurasian lynx was killed in the 1930s, though unconfirmed sightings continued until the 1990s. The Síndic d&#x27;Aran planned a reintroduction in 2016 but canceled it due to the opposition of hunters and livestock farmers.

In Germany, the Eurasian lynx was exterminated in 1850. It was reintroduced to the Bavarian Forest and the Harz in the 1990s; other areas were populated by lynxes migrating from France and the Czech Republic. In 2002, the first birth of wild lynx on German territory was announced, following a litter from a pair of lynx in the Harz National Park. Small populations exist also in Saxon Switzerland, Palatinate Forest, and Fichtel Mountains. Eurasian lynx also migrated to Austria, where they had also been exterminated. An episode of the PBS television series &quot;Nature&quot; featured the return of the lynx to Austria&#x27;s Kalkalpen National Park after a 150-year absence. A higher proportion is killed by humans than by infectious diseases.

In Switzerland, the Eurasian lynx was exterminated in the early 20th century, with the last confirmed sighting around Simplon pass in 1904. From 1971 on, Carpathian lynx were reintroduced in the Alps and the Jura Mountains. Since then, the population has grown slowly but steadily. In 2019, around 250 lynx were reportedly living in Switzerland, roughly a third of them in the Jura Mountains, and the rest in the Alps and Pre-Alps.

The Eurasian lynx was exterminated in the French Alps in the early 20th century. Following reintroduction of lynx in the Swiss Jura Mountains in the 1970s, lynxes were recorded again in the French Alps and Jura from the late 1970s onwards.

In Italy, it recolonised the Italian Alps since the 1980s, also from reintroduced populations in Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia. By 2010, the Alpine lynx population comprised about 120–150 individuals ranging over in six sub-areas.

In the Netherlands, lynxes have been sighted sporadically since 1985 in the country&#x27;s southern part. Since 2020, the presence of lynxes has been confirmed by camera trapping in the Ardennes region in southern Belgium, proving the presence of the species following more than 25 years of unconfirmed sightings in the region.

==== Central and Eastern Europe ====

* Balkan peninsula: The Balkan lynx subspecies is found in Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Bulgaria and possibly Greece. They can be found in remote mountainous regions of the Balkans, with the largest numbers in remote hills of western North Macedonia, eastern Albania and northern Albania. The Balkan lynx is considered a national symbol of North Macedonia, and it is depicted on the reverse of the Macedonian 5 denars coin, issued in 1993. The name of Lynkestis, a Macedonian tribe, is translated as &quot;Land of the Lynx&quot;. It has been on the brink of extinction for nearly 100 years. Numbers are estimated to be around 100, and the decline is due to illegal poaching.
* Carpathian Mountains: About 2,800 Eurasian lynx live in the mountain range, split between the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and Hungary. It is the largest contiguous Eurasian lynx population west of the Russian border.
* Dinaric Alps and Julian Alps: Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina are home to approx. 130–200 lynx. The Eurasian lynx had been considered extinct in these countries since the beginning of the 20th century. However, a successful reintroduction project was carried out in Slovenia in 1973, when three female and three male lynx from Slovakia were released in the Kočevski Rog forest. Today, lynx are present in the Dinaric forests of the south and southeastern part of Slovenia and in the Croatian regions of Gorski kotar and Velebit, spanning the Dinaric Alps and over the Dinara Mountains into western Bosnia and Herzegovina. The lynx has been also spotted in the Julian Alps and elsewhere in western Slovenia, but the A1 motorway presents a significant hindrance to the development of the population there. Croatia&#x27;s Plitvice Lakes National Park is home to several pairs of the lynx. In the three countries, the Eurasian lynx is listed as an endangered species and protected by law. Realistic population estimates are 40 lynx in Slovenia, 40–60 in Croatia, and more than 50 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Croatian massif Risnjak in Risnjak National Park got its name from the Croatian word for the lynx, &quot;ris&quot;.
* Belarus: the most recent data from the national parks, reserves, and hunting grounds demonstrate the number of lynxes in Belarus to be in the range of 550 to 600 animals.
* Bulgaria: the animal was declared extinct in Bulgaria in 1985, but sightings continued well into the 1990s. In 2006 an audio recording of a lynx mating call was made in the Strandzha mountain range in the southeast. Two years later an ear-marked individual was accidentally shot near Belogradchik in the northwest, and a few months later a mounted trap camera caught a glimpse of another individual. Further camera records followed in Osogovo and Strandzha, confirming that the species has returned to the country. A thorough examination on the subject is yet to be made available.
* Czech Republic: In Bohemia, the Eurasian lynx was exterminated in the 19th century (1830–1890) and in Moravia probably at the turn of the 20th century. After 1945, migration from Slovakia created a small and unstable population in Moravia. In the 1980s, almost 20 specimens were imported from Slovakia and reintroduced in the Šumava area. In early 2006, the population of lynx in the Czech Republic was estimated at 65–105 individuals. Hunting is prohibited, but the lynx is often threatened by poachers.
* Estonia: There are 900 individuals in Estonia according to a 2001 estimate. Although 180 lynx were legally hunted in Estonia in 2010, the country still has the highest known density of the species in Europe.
* Hungary: The population is estimated at 10-12 animals, in the northern mountain ranges of the country close to Slovakia.
* Latvia: According to a 2005 estimate, about 700 animals inhabit areas in Courland and Vidzeme.
* Lithuania: The population is estimated at 80–100 animals.
* Poland: In its Environment and Environmental Protection Section, the 2011 Central Statistical Office Report puts the number of Eurasian lynxes observed in the wild in Poland as of 2010 at approximately 285. There are two major populations of lynxes in Poland, one in the northeastern part of the country (most notably in the Białowieża Forest) and the other in the southeastern part in the Carpathian Mountains. Since the 1980s, lynxes have also been spotted in the region of Roztocze, Solska Forest, Polesie Lubelskie, and Karkonosze Mountains, though they still remain rare in those areas. A successfully reintroduced population of lynxes has also been living in the Kampinos National Park since the 1990s.
* Slovakia: the Eurasian lynx inhabits deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests at elevations of , mostly in national parks and other protected areas; its presence has been positively confirmed in more than half of Slovak territory (2012). In terms of absolute numbers though in Štiavnica Mountains and Veľká Fatra National Park, surveys during 2011 to 2014 revealed that less than 30 individuals were present in these protected areas, with anthropic disturbances, poaching and insufficient counting methods used by forestry cited as the main causes of the unreliable population figures.
* Romania: over 2,000 Eurasian lynx live in Romania, including most of the Carpathian population. However, some experts consider these official population numbers to be overestimated. Limited hunting is permitted but the population is stable.
*Russia: , the Russian lynx population was estimated as comprising 22,510 individuals, of which about 9,000 were found in European Russia. The populations were assessed as stable in some regions, but decreasing in others.
* Ukraine: The Eurasian lynx is native to forested areas of the country. Before the 19th century it was common also in the forest steppe zone. Nowadays, the most significant populations remain in the Carpathian mountains and across the forests of Polesia. The population is estimated as 80–90 animals for the Polesia region and 350–400 for the forests of the Carpathians.

=== Asia ===
==== Anatolia and Caucasus ====
In the Anatolian part of Turkey, the Eurasian lynx is present in the Lesser Caucasus, Kaçkar Mountains and Artvin Province. In Ciglikara Nature Reserve located in the Taurus Mountains, 15 individuals were identified. More than 50 individuals were identified and monitored at a forest-steppe mixed ecosystem in northwestern Anatolia by camera traps, genetic material and radiotelemetry between 2009 and 2019. In Kars Province, a breeding population occurs in Sarıkamış-Allahuekber Mountains National Park.
The Eurasian lynx and grey wolf can occur sympatrically, as they occupy different trophic niches.

==== Central Asia ====
In Central Asia, it is native to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and the Chinese provinces of Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and to the northern slopes of Iran&#x27;s Alborz Mountains and Mongolia.

In northern Pakistan, the Eurasian lynx was recorded at elevations of in Chitral District.
In India: Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and most other Himalayan states.

In Nepal, a Eurasian lynx was sighted in the western Dhaulagiri massif in 1975. It is also present above elevations of in Humla, Mustang and Dolpa Districts.

==== East Asia ====
Fossils of the Eurasian or a closely related &quot;Lynx&quot; species from the Late Pleistocene era and onward were excavated at various locations in the Japanese archipelago. Since no archaeological evidence dated after the Yayoi period has been found, it was probably extirpated from the Japanese archipelago during the Jōmon period.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
=== Behavior ===

Although they may hunt during the day when food is scarce, the Eurasian lynx is mainly nocturnal or crepuscular, and spends the day sleeping in dense thickets or other places of concealment. It lives as an adult. The hunting area of Eurasian lynx can be anything from , depending on the local availability of prey. Males tend to hunt over much larger areas than females, which tend to occupy exclusive, rather than overlapping, hunting ranges. The Eurasian lynx can travel up to during one night, although about half this distance is more typical. They patrol regularly throughout all parts of their hunting range, using scent marks to indicate their presence to other individuals. As with other cats, its scent marks may consist of faeces, urine, or scrape marks, with the former often being left in prominent locations along the boundary of the hunting territory. Eurasian lynx makes a range of vocalizations, but is generally silent outside of the breeding season. They have been observed to mew, hiss, growl, and purr, and, like domestic cats, will &quot;chatter&quot; at prey that is just out of reach. Mating calls are much louder, consisting of deep growls in the male, and loud &quot;meow-like&quot; sounds in the female. Eurasian lynx are secretive, and because the sounds they make are very quiet and seldom heard, their presence in an area may go unnoticed for years. Remnants of prey or tracks on snow are usually observed long before the animal is seen.

=== Diet and hunting ===
The Eurasian lynx is an ambush predator but also hunts by stalking, sneaking and jumping on prey using both vision and hearing. When snow conditions make this harder, it may be forced to switch to larger prey. It often climbs onto high rocks or fallen trees to scan the surrounding area. It is a powerful predator that has killed adult deer weighing at least .

Eurasian lynx in Europe prey largely on small to fairly large sized mammals and birds. Among the recorded prey items for the species are hares, rabbits, marmots, squirrels, dormice, muskrats, martens, grouse, red foxes, wild boar, chamois, young moose, European roe deer, red deer, reindeer and other ungulates. In keeping with its larger size, the Eurasian lynx is the only lynx species to preferentially take ungulates. Although taking on larger prey presents a risk to the Eurasian lynx, the bounty provided by killing them can outweigh the risks. The Eurasian lynx thus prefers fairly large ungulate prey, especially during winter, when small prey is less abundant. Where common, roe deer appear to be the preferred prey species for the Eurasian lynx.

In Estonia, a typical adult lynx kills about 60 roe deer a year; in the years when the roe deer population plummets, the lynx switch to beavers, hares, foxes, raccoon dogs, and birds. Even where roe deer are quite uncommon, the deer are still quantitatively the favored prey species, though in summer smaller prey and occasional domestic sheep are eaten more regularly. In parts of Finland, introduced white-tailed deer are eaten regularly. In some areas in Poland and Austria, red deer is the preferred prey, and in Switzerland, chamois is locally favored. Eurasian lynx also feeds on carrion when available. Adult lynx require of meat per day, and may take several days to fully consume some of their larger prey.

In the Mediterranean mixed forest-steppe and subalpine ecosystems of Anatolia the main and most preferred prey of the Eurasian lynx is European hare, forming 79% to 99% of prey biomass eaten. Although the lynx is in sympatry with wild ungulates, such as wild goat, chamois, red deer and wild boar in these ecosystems, ungulate biomass in lynx diet does not exceed 10%. In ten other study sites in the Black Sea region of northern Anatolia where roe deer can occur in high densities, lynx occurrence is positively correlated with European hare occurrence rather than roe deer. Lynx in Anatolia also has physiological requirements and morphological adjustments similar to other lagomorph specialists, with a daily prey intake of about . It is therefore classified as lagomorph specialist. Diet studies in central Asia and Yakutia also indicate a diet mainly composed of lagomorphs and ungulate prey contributes in low amounts to lynx diet.
Eurasian lynx scat found in Dolpa District in the Nepal Himalayas contained remains of woolly hare (&quot;Lepus oiostolus&quot;), pika (&quot;Ochotona&quot; sp.), mountain voles (&quot;Alticola&quot; sp.), Himalayan marmot (&quot;Marmota himalayana&quot;) and domestic goat (&quot;Capra hircus&quot;).

=== Reproduction ===
The mating season of the Eurasian lynx lasts from January to April. The female typically comes into oestrus only once during this period, lasting from four to seven days. If the first litter is lost, a second period of oestrus is common. It does not appear to be able to control its reproductive behaviour based on prey availability. Gestation lasts from 67 to 74 days. Pregnant females construct dens in secluded locations, often protected by overhanging branches or tree roots. The den is lined with feathers, deer hair, and dry grass to provide bedding for the young. At birth, Eurasian lynx kittens weigh and open their eyes after ten to twelve days. They initially have plain, greyish-brown fur, attaining the full adult colouration around eleven weeks of age. They begin to take solid food at six to seven weeks, when they begin to leave the den, but are not fully weaned for five or six months. The den is abandoned two to three months after the kittens are born, but the young typically remain with their mother until they are around ten months of age. Eurasian lynx reach sexual maturity at two or three years, and have lived for twenty one years in captivity.
Females usually have two kittens; litters with more than three kittens are rare.

=== Predator dynamics ===
The primary predators of the lynx are the gray wolf and, in the northern part of its range, the wolverine. In Russian forests, gray wolves kill and eat lynx that fail to escape into trees, as evidenced by examination of wolf and lynx trackways in the Central Forest Nature Reserve, and of lynx hair and bones found in wolf stomach contents in the Belovezh Forest. The lynx saves itself from its enemies by quickly climbing a tree or down the edge of a cliff or ravine; it usually lives near a &#x27;stronghold&#x27; place and eats its food in a high tree or on an inaccessible ledge. Lynx populations decrease when wolves appear in an area, such as observed in the Pritelsk region of the Altai Mountains, and lynx are likely to take smaller prey where wolves are active. In eastern Slovakia, after an increase of wolves after World War II, lynx were observed to move out.

However, there is also a reported instance of a male lynx having expelled an adult and apparently healthy male wolf in Belarus in a fight. After the incident, the wolf vanished from the record, suggesting that it might have succumbed to the wounds sustained during the fight. Moreover, recent population dynamics and a high mortality rate among wolf cubs in the Naliboki forest might be connected to an increasing lynx population. All in all, this suggests that, at least locally, lynx may dominate wolves, since no signs for predation of wolves on lynx was found. In the Pechora-Ilych Nature Reserve in Russia, wolverine predation and consumption of lynx has been documented, and in the Altai Mountains, the lynx actively avoids wolverines.

The gray wolf, wolverine, as well as the red fox and the eagle owl, are also competitors with the Eurasian lynx for prey, notably in the taiga regions of Russia. In years of low hare populations, the competition becomes especially fierce; the lynx is at a disadvantage as its competitors are able to capture additional, larger prey animals, and more efficiently. This competition may be especially severe in the northern parts of the lynx&#x27;s range, where lynx populations are vastly outnumbered by red fox and even by wolverine. The presence of other large carnivores is one factor limiting their population.

In two ecosystems of Anatolia, cannibalism was common, and fellow lynx were found to form 5% to 8% of prey biomass in their diets. Claws and bones analysed showed that sub-adult lynx were the victims of cannibalism during the mating and spring seasons. Lynx were not found in the sympatrically occurring wolves&#x27; diets. On the contrary, lynx themselves were the predators of red fox, pine marten, domestic and feral cats and dogs, and golden jackal remains have also been found in lynx fecal samples, possibly the result of carrion consumption. Occasionally, in areas such as Manchuria and the Amur River, it may be possible the Amur leopard targets lynx; in the same geographic region, Siberian tigers have also preyed on lynxes, as evidenced by examination of tiger stomach contents.
In Sweden, out of 33 deaths of lynx of a population being observed, one was probably killed by a wolverine. Lynx compete for food with the predators described above, and also with the red fox, eagle owls, golden eagles, wild boar (which scavenge from lynx kills), and in the southern part of its range, the snow leopard and leopard as well. Brown bears, although not (so far as is known) a predator of Eurasian lynx, are in some areas a semi-habitual usurpers of ungulate kills by lynxes, not infrequently before the cat has had a chance to consume its kill itself.

== Conservation ==

The Eurasian lynx is included on CITES Appendix II and listed as a protected species in the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, Appendix III. Hunting lynx is illegal in many range countries, with the exception of Estonia, Latvia, Russia, Armenia and Iraq. Since 2005, the Norwegian government sets national population goals, while a committee of representatives from county assemblies decide on hunting quotas.
