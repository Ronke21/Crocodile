<text>The New York City Fire Department, officially the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) is the full-service fire department of New York City, serving all five boroughs. The FDNY is responsible for providing Fire Suppression Services, Specialized Hazardous Materials Response Services, Emergency Medical Response Services and Specialized Technical Rescue Services in the entire city.

The New York City Fire Department is the largest municipal fire department in North America, and the Western Hemisphere, and the second largest in the world after the Tokyo Fire Department. The FDNY employs over 11,000 uniformed firefighting employees, 4,500 uniformed EMTs, paramedics, and EMS employees, and 2,000 civilian employees. Its regulations are compiled in title 3 of the &quot;New York City Rules&quot;. The FDNY&#x27;s motto is &quot;New York&#x27;s Bravest&quot; for fire, and &quot;New York&#x27;s Best&quot; for EMS. The FDNY serves more than 8.5 million residents within a area.

The FDNY headquarters is located at 9 MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn, and the FDNY Fire Academy is located on Randalls Island. There are 3 International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) Locals: The Uniformed Firefighters Association is represented by IAFF Local 94. The Uniformed Fire Officers Association is represented by IAFF Local 854 and the Uniformed Fire Alarm Dispatchers Benevolent Association is represented by IAFF Local 4959. EMS is represented by DC 37 Locals 2507 for EMTs and paramedics and Local 3621 for officers.

==Organization==
Like most fire departments of major cities in the United States, the New York City Fire Department is organized in a paramilitary fashion, and in many cases, echoes the structure of the police department. The department&#x27;s executive staff is divided into two areas that include a civilian Fire Commissioner who serves as the head of the department and a Chief of Department who serves as the operational leader. The current NYC Fire Commissioner is Robert Tucker, who succeeded Laura Kavanagh in August 2024. The executive staff includes several civilian deputy commissioners who are responsible for the many administrative bureaus within the department, along with the Chief of Department, Chief of Fire Operations, Chief of EMS, Chief Fire Marshal, Chief of Training and other staff chiefs. Staff chiefs include the seven citywide tour commanders, the Chief of Fire Prevention, and the Chief of Safety.

Operationally and geographically, the department is organized into five borough commands for each of the five Boroughs of New York City. Each borough command has a borough commander. For Manhattan, this commander is an Assistant Chief, whereas each of the other four borough commanders are deputy assistant chiefs. Within those five borough commands exists nine firefighting divisions, each of which are headed by a deputy chief, who also has several deputy chiefs to help run the division when the deputy chief is not on duty. Within each division are four to seven battalions, each led by a battalion chief. The lead battalion chief for the battalion is the battalion commander and the others are battalion chiefs. Each battalion consists of three to eight firehouses and consists of approximately 180–200 firefighters and officers. Each firehouse consists of one to three fire companies. Each fire company is led by a captain, who commands three lieutenants and twelve to twenty firefighters. Tours can be either night tours (6 p.m. – 9 a.m.) or day tours (9 a.m. – 6 p.m.). Under a swapping system called “mutuals”, most firefighters combine tours and work a 24-hour shift, followed by three days off. In one tour or shift, each company is commanded by an officer (lieutenant or captain) and is made up of four to five firefighters for engine companies, five firefighters for ladder companies, rescue companies, or squad companies, and six firefighters for the hazardous materials company.

The FDNY faces highly multifaceted firefighting challenges in many ways unique to New York. In addition to responding to building types that range from wood-frame single family homes to high-rise structures, there are many secluded bridges and tunnels, the New York City Subway system, as well as large parks and wooded areas that can give rise to brush fires.

The FDNY also responds to many other incidents such as auto accidents, auto extrications, gas emergencies, entrapments, construction accidents, high-angle rescues, trench rescues, confined space incidents, explosions, transit incidents, unstable buildings or collapses, hazardous materials incidents, medical emergencies and many more.

==History==
===1648–1865===

The origins of the New York City Fire Department go back to 1648 when the first fire ordinance was adopted in what was then the Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam. Peter Stuyvesant, within one year of his arrival, appointed four fire wardens to wooden chimneys of thatched-roofed wooden houses, charging a penalty to owners whose chimneys were improperly swept. The first four fire wardens were Martin Krieger, Thomas Hall, Adrian Wyser, and George Woolsey.
Hooks, ladders and buckets were financed through the collection of fines for dirty chimneys, and a fire watch was established, consisting of eight wardens which were drawn from the male population. An organisation known as the &quot;prowlers&quot; but given the nickname &quot;the rattle watch&quot; patrolled the streets with buckets, ladders and hooks from nine in the evening until dawn looking for fires. Leather shoe buckets, 250 in all, were manufactured by local Dutch shoemakers in 1658, and these &quot;bucket brigades&quot; are regarded as the beginning of the New York Fire Department.

In 1664, New Amsterdam became an English settlement and was renamed New York. The first New York fire brigade entered service in 1731 equipped with two hand-drawn pumpers which had been transported from London, England. These two pumpers formed Engine Company 1 and Engine Company 2. These were the first fire engines to be used in the American colonies, and all able-bodied citizens were required to respond to a fire alarm and to participate in the extinguishing under the supervision of the Aldermen.

The city&#x27;s first firehouse was built in 1736 in front of City Hall on Broad Street. A year later, on December 16, 1737, the colony&#x27;s General Assembly created the Volunteer Fire Department of the City of New York, appointing 30 men who would remain on call in exchange for exemption from jury and militia duty. The city&#x27;s first official firemen were required to be &quot;able, discreet, and sober men who shall be known as Firemen of the City of New York, to be ready for service by night and by day and be diligent, industrious and vigilant.&quot;

Although the 1737 Act created the basis of the fire department, the actual legal entity was incorporated in the State of New York on March 20, 1798 under the name of &quot;Fire Department, City of New York.&quot;

The city&#x27;s oldest fire company still in operation was organized July 10, 1772 as Hook and Ladder Co. 1. The company was disbanded in 1776 when the British Army invaded Manhattan following the Continental Army&#x27;s loss at the Battle of Brooklyn and the resulting loss of Manhattan after the Landing at Kip&#x27;s Bay, and most of the firefighters making up the company fled the city. Following the British Evacuation of New York in November 1783, on June 16, 1784, Mutual Hook and Ladder 1 was reorganized. The company operated continuously during the volunteer fire department days, and on the organization of the Paid System, Hook and Ladder Company No.1 was created September 8, 1865, using the same location, the same truck and the same red cap fronts as Mutual Hook and Ladder No.1 did, and nine of her twelve members had served in the old company. It was the only company that was continued with the same number and location, and might be said that Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 has had a continuous existence since June 16, 1784. The company has moved firehouses several times since its inception, and has been housed at 100 Duane Street in Tribeca since December 31, 1905, with Engine 7 and Battalion 1. The company later became the first Tower Ladder company in the city in 1964.

In 1845, the last great fire to affect Manhattan began early in the morning and was subdued that afternoon. The fire killed four firefighters, 26 civilians, and destroyed 345 buildings.

===1865–1898===
In 1865, the volunteer fire department was abolished by a state act which created the &quot;Metropolitan Fire District&quot; and the &quot;Metropolitan Fire Department&quot; (&quot;MFD&quot;). This effectively gave control of the fire departments in the cities of New York and Brooklyn to the Governor who appointed his Board of Commissioners. There was never any effective incorporation of the fire departments of the two cities during this period. It wasn&#x27;t until the Greater City of New York was consolidated in 1898 that the two were combined under one common organization or organizational structure. The change met with a mixed reaction from the citizens, and some of the eliminated volunteers became bitter and resentful, which resulted in both political battles and street fights. The insurance companies in the city, however, finally won the battle and had the volunteers replaced with paid firefighters. The members of the paid fire department were primarily selected from the prior volunteers. All of the volunteer&#x27;s apparatus, including their fire houses, were seized by the state who made use of them to form the new organization and form the basis of the current FDNY. The MFD lasted until 1870 when the Tweed Charter ended state control in the city. As a result, a new Board of Fire Commissioners was created and the original name of the &quot;Fire Department City of New York&quot; (&quot;FDNY&quot;) was reinstated.
Initially, the paid fire service only covered present day Manhattan, until the act of 1865 which united Brooklyn with Manhattan to form the Metropolitan District. The same year the fire department consisted of 13 Chief Officers and 552 Company Officers and firemen. The officers and firemen worked a continuous tour of duty, with three hours a day off for meals and one day off a month, and were paid salaries according to their rank or grade. 1865 also saw the first adoption of regulations, although they were fairly strict and straitlaced. Following several large fires in 1866 (which resulted in excessive fire losses and a rise in insurance rates), the fire department was reorganized under the command of General Alexander Shaler, and with military discipline the paid department reached its full potential which resulted in a general reduction in fire losses. In 1870, the merit system of promotion in the Fire Department was established. Southwestern Westchester County (which would later become the western Bronx) was annexed by New York in 1874; as a result, the volunteers there were phased out and replaced by the paid department. This pattern was repeated as City services expanded elsewhere.

===1898–2001===

On January 1, 1898, the different areas of New York were consolidated, which ushered the Fire Department into a new era. All the fire forces in the various sections were brought under the unified command of the first Commissioner in the history of the Fire Department. This same year, Richmond (now Staten Island) became a part of the City of New York. However, the volunteer units there remained in place until they were gradually replaced by paid units in 1915, 1928, 1932 and 1937, when only two volunteer units remained, Oceanic Hook &amp; Ladder Vol Engine and Richmond Fire.

The unification of the Fire Department, which took place in 1898, would pave the way for many changes. In 1909, the Fire Department received its first piece of motorized fire apparatus. On March 25, 1911 a fire in the Triangle Shirtwaist Company killed 146 workers, most of whom were young female immigrants. Later the same year the fire college was formed to train new fire fighters, and on May 1, 1913 the Bureau of Fire Prevention was created.

In 1919, the Uniformed Firefighters Association was formed. Tower ladders and the SuperPumper System were introduced in 1965. Major apparatus of the SuperPumper System (the SuperPumper and the SuperTender) was phased out in 1982, in favor of the Maxi-Water Unit. But the 5 Satellite Units of the system, together with the Maxi-Water Unit (known as Satellite 6 since 1999) are still actively used as of 2007 for multiple alarm fires and certain other incidents. These are now called the Satellite Water System. Other technical advances included the introduction of high pressure water systems, the creation of a Marine fleet, adoption of vastly improved working conditions and the utilization of improved radio communications.

On November 23, 1965, incoming Mayor Lindsay announced the appointment of Robert O. Lowery as Fire Commissioner of the New York City Fire Department. His was the first commissioner level appointment announced by the Mayor-elect. Lowery, who was the first African American to serve as a Fire Commissioner of a major U.S. city, served in that position for more than seven years until his resignation on September 29, 1973 in order to campaign for then-Controller Abraham D. Beame, the Democratic candidate for Mayor.

In 1977, the New York City Fire Department announced that women could take the exam to become firefighters. After passing the written portion of the exam, Brenda Berkman and 89 other women subsequently failed the physical portion. It was stated by an official that their physical test was “the most difficult the department had ever administered, [and] was designed more to keep women out than to accurately assess job-related skills.” After Berkman&#x27;s requests for a fairer test were ignored, she filed an ultimately successful class-action lawsuit: &quot;Brenda Berkman, et al. v. The City of New York&quot; (1982). A new test was created in which standards were changed so the test was job-related and Berkman with about 40 other women passed to enter the fire academy in 1982. (&quot;See Brenda Berkman, et al. v. The City of New York&quot;, CV-79-1813, 536 F. Supp. 177 (E.D.N.Y. 1982), &quot;aff’d&quot; Berkman v. City of New York, 705 F.2d 584 (2d Cir. 1983.))

The Waldbaum&#x27;s supermarket fire was a major fire on August 2, 1978 in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, New York that killed six FDNY firefighters.

On March 17, 1996, Mayor Rudy Giuliani merged the emergency medical services of the NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation into the FDNY.

====September 11 attacks====
On September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 were hijacked by two separate groups of five Islamic terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda and flown into the World Trade Center&#x27;s North and South Towers respectively, causing massive damage to both towers during impact, and starting fires that caused the weakened 110-story skyscrapers to collapse within less than two hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;9/11Commission&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

FDNY fire companies and EMS crews were deployed to the World Trade Center minutes after Flight 11 struck the north tower. Chief officers set up a command center in the lobby as first arriving units entered the tower and firefighters began climbing the stairs. A mobile command center was also set up outside on Vesey Street, but was destroyed when the towers collapsed. A command post was then set up at a firehouse in Greenwich Village. The FDNY deployed 121 engine companies, 62 truck companies, five rescue companies, six squad companies, 27 Chief Officers, along with many other units to the site, with more than 1,000 firefighters, EMTs and paramedics on the scene when the towers collapsed.

Many firefighters arrived at the World Trade Center without meeting at the command centers. Problems with radio communication caused commanders to lose contact with many of the firefighters who went into the towers; those firefighters were unable to hear evacuation orders. There was practically no communication with the New York City Police Department, which had helicopters at the scene. When the towers collapsed, hundreds were trapped within and 343 fire department members along with 1 fire patrolman were killed. The fatalities included First Deputy Commissioner William M. Feehan, Chief of Department Peter Ganci, Department Chaplain Mychal Judge, Battalion Chief Orio Palmer and Fire Marshal Ronald Paul Bucca. Hundreds of firefighter funerals were held in the weeks to follow, including 16 in one day on Saturday, September 29, 2001.

Following the attacks, citywide fire response times that day rose by just one minute, to an average of 5.5 minutes. Many of the surviving firefighters continued to work alternating 24-hour shifts during the rescue and recovery effort, and they were joined by other firefighters and EMS personnel from hundreds of miles around New York City. Among the arriving units were career and volunteer personnel from Upstate New York, Long Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Florida.

===2002–present===

In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Fire Department has rebuilt itself and continues to serve the people of New York. During the Northeast Blackout of 2003, FDNY was called on to rescue hundreds of people from stranded elevators in approximately 800 Manhattan high-rise office and apartment buildings. The entire fire department was held over from the day tour to almost double the total force to 3,401 firefighters to handle the many fires which resulted, reportedly from people using candles for light.

At the beginning of the 21st century, there were 11,400 uniformed fire officers and firefighters under the command of the Chief of Department. The New York City Fire Department also employed 2800 Emergency Medical Technicians, Paramedics and Supervisors assigned to Department&#x27;s EMS Command, and 1200 civilian employees.

In 2003, Mayor Bloomberg ordered the closure of six Engine Companies, four in Brooklyn (Engine 204, Engine 209, Engine 212, Engine 278), one in Manhattan (Engine 36), and one in Queens (Engine 261).
In 2019 Lillian Bonsignore became the first openly gay and the first female chief of EMS Operations for the FDNY.

Robert Tucker is the current commissioner of the FDNY, appointed by Eric Adams after Laura Kavanagh resigned in August 2024. Kavanagh was preceded by Daniel A. Nigro, who retired on February 16, 2022 after serving as commissioner for 8 years. 

====Allegations of race discrimination====
Over the years, the FDNY has faced and has settled numerous discrimination lawsuits alleging that the FDNY engages in a culture where hiring discrimination towards racial minorities and discrimination towards racial minorities employed by the FDNY by passing them over for raises and promotions is encouraged. Most notably in 2014, the City of New York made a $98 million discrimination lawsuit settlement for a lawsuit brought by the Vulcan Society, an African-American firefighter fraternal organization. There have also been investigations concerning FDNY firefighters engaging in bullying and harassing behavior of Muslim firefighters including behavior such as firefighters trying to slip pork products, which are prohibited under Islamic law, into the food of Muslim firefighters. In another case, the son of a former FDNY commissioner was hired as a firefighter despite allegedly making anti-Semitic comments.

==Ideology and core competencies==

The FDNY derives its name from the Tweed Charter which created the &quot;Fire Department of the City of New York&quot;. This is in contrast to most other fire departments in the U.S. where the name of the city precedes the words &quot;fire department&quot;.

===Ideology===
* The FDNY ideology of aggressive interior fire attack grew naturally out of the building and population density that characterize the city.
* The contribution of Irish and Italian Americans to the FDNY dates back to the formation of the paid fire department. During the Civil War, New York&#x27;s Irish and Italian firefighters were the backbone of the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment (New York Fire Zouaves), a highly decorated unit.
* Members of the FDNY have the nickname &quot;New York&#x27;s Bravest.&quot;
* Members of the FDNY EMS have the nickname &quot;New York&#x27;s Best.&quot;
* In addition to firefighting, technical rescue, and hazardous materials mitigation, FDNY stations ambulances throughout the city, and supplies paramedics and EMTs.

Together with ambulances run by certain participating hospitals (locally known as voluntaries, not to be confused with volunteers) and private companies, it is known as the FDNY EMS Command, which is the largest pre-hospital care provider in the world, responding to over 1.5 million calls each year. All of the FDNY EMS Command members are also trained to the &quot;HAZMAT Operations&quot; level. A select group of 39 EMS units (18 BLS and 21 ALS) are known as Hazardous Material Tactical Units. Haz-Tac Ambulance members are trained to the level of &quot;Hazardous Materials Technician&quot;, which allows them to provide emergency medical care and decontamination in hazardous environments, in addition to their normal pre-hospital duties. Of these 39, eleven are also Rescue Paramedic Ambulances, whose crews are additionally trained for: Confined Space Rescue, Trench Rescue, Crush Injuries, and Building Collapse Rescues. Both the Rescue Medics and Haztac units operate with additional, exclusive protocols and specialized medical equipment. 

===Core competencies===
A citywide Incident Management System plan released by the Office of the Mayor on May 14, 2004 set forth several &quot;core competencies,&quot; which determine which agency has the authority to direct operations. FDNY core competencies include:
* Fire suppression
* Pre-hospital emergency medical care
* Search and rescue
* Structural evacuation
* CBRNE/HAZMAT life safety and mass decontamination
* Cause and origin, and arson investigations
* Fire prevention inspections

==Training==

Located centrally at the Training Academy on Randall&#x27;s Island, the Bureau of Training is responsible for all firefighter training needs for the Fire Department of New York. Initial training of all firefighter candidates undergo an 18-week academy that consists of classroom education and physical fitness performance. EMS training occurs at The FDNY EMS Academy located at Fort Totten (Queens) where EMT training is 13–18 weeks and paramedic training is 9 months.

==Communications==

There are two Bureau of Fire Communications Dispatch Offices: &quot;Public Safety Answering Center 1&quot; (PSAC 1) located at 11 Metrotech Center, Brooklyn, and &quot;Public Safety Answering Center 2&quot; (PSAC 2) located at 350 Marconi Street, Bronx. PSAC 1 covers Brooklyn, Staten Island and Citywide which is part of the Joint Operation Center as of October 2020. PSAC 2 covers the Bronx, Manhattan and Queens.

An initial call to an FDNY Communications Dispatch Office is taken by the &quot;Alarm Receipt Dispatcher&quot; (ARD), who speaks with the caller in order to determine the nature of the emergency. The ARD interrogates the caller to ascertain pertinent information and processes it into the Starfire computer system, which generates an incident and provides a recommended fire department resource response based on the information provided. This information is automatically sent to the &quot;Decision Dispatcher&quot; (DD).

When the Decision Dispatcher has made a decision as to what units will actually be assigned to the incident, unless the supervisor intervenes, the dispatcher releases the incident with assigned companies. An alarm is routed to the assigned companies, both in their respective firehouses and to the individual mobile data terminals (MDT), of each company&#x27;s apparatus when it is in the field, depending on where the Starfire computer shows them to be situated. If a company/unit in a firehouse does not acknowledge the run within 30 seconds, the computer will notify the &quot;Voice Alarm Dispatcher&quot; (VAD), who will call that unit via radio in their firehouse by the dedicated intercom system. One minute after the alarm is released, it will appear on the computer screen of the radio dispatcher (Radio), who will announce the alarm and the response two times, and ask for acknowledgment from any companies assigned who have not done so by radio, voice alarm, or MDT. The radio dispatcher has a special keyboard called the Status Entry Panel (SEP), which is used to update the status of units based on information received by radio.

The entire process from initial notification until a unit is dispatched can take up to two minutes, depending on the complexity of the call, the information provided by the caller(s), and the degree of other alarm activity in the office. If a dispatch office is so busy that its incoming telephone alarm lines are all occupied or not answered within 30 seconds, the call is automatically transferred to another borough dispatch office. If an Emergency Reporting System (ERS) street fire alarm box is not answered within 60 seconds, usually because all of the alarm receipt consoles are in use, the computer automatically dispatches an engine company to the location of the physical street fire alarm box.

Any communications dispatch office in the city can take a fire or emergency call by telephone for any borough, and upon completion of information taking, the incident will automatically be routed by the Starfire computer to the Decision Dispatcher (DD) for the borough in which the incident is reported.

Fire Dispatch has a minimum staffing (Staffing Level 1), which consist of one &quot;Chief Dispatcher&quot;, who supervises five &quot;Tour Supervising Dispatchers&quot; (1 in each Borough). The TSDs supervises between 4–8 Dispatchers, depending on Borough and Time/Day. The minimum staffing may be increased based on many variables, such as: an extraordinary increase in volume of incidents, a catastrophic event, in preparation of a storm, and during large events.

===Alarm receipt and transmittal===

There are four ways in which fires and emergencies can be reported to the New York City Fire Department: telephone alarms; fire alarm boxes; &quot;Class 3&quot; alarms; verbal alarms.
* Telephone alarms are the most common method of contacting the fire department. A telephone alarm is an alarm in which a civilian uses a telephone to dial one of three types of numbers: The first is 9-1-1, which is answered by New York City Police Department (NYPD) operators. The NYPD operators will then transfer the call to a fire department communications office. The second involves dialing &quot;0&quot; which routes the call to a telephone company operator, who then transfers the call to the fire dispatchers in the proper borough dispatch office. The third is a special seven-digit telephone number, which is published in each borough for the specific purpose of reporting fires. This number is a direct contact to a particular borough&#x27;s fire department communications dispatch office.
* Fire alarm boxes are the second most common method of contacting the fire department. FDNY fire alarm boxes are located on certain street corners and in certain public buildings, such as schools and hospitals, as well as along highways, on bridges, etc. These boxes primarily consist of two types: The first is the mechanical box (also commonly called a &quot;pull-box&quot; or a &quot;telegraph box&quot;), in which a spring-wound mechanism alternately opens and closes an electrical circuit, thereby rendering a coded number linked to the specific location of the box. Until the advent of the Starfire &quot;Computer-Assisted Dispatch System&quot; (CADS), dispatchers had to audibly count the taps from mechanical boxes when they were received in the central offices to decipher the number of the box that was pulled. Today, a &quot;Box Alarm Readout System&quot; (BARS) display handles that aspect of the job; The second type is the &quot;Emergency Reporting System&quot; (ERS) box that is equipped with buttons to notify either the FDNY or the NYPD, allowing either department&#x27;s dispatcher to have direct voice communication with the reporting party. Beginning in the 1970s, ERS boxes started to replace mechanical boxes in many areas of the city, particularly where the number of false alarms involving mechanical boxes were high. In December 1994, then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and then-Fire Commissioner Howard Safir began a concerted effort to remove all of the mechanical and ERS boxes throughout New York City in a cost-cutting move. Facing stiff opposition from members of the city council, community groups, dispatchers, and others, the move was blocked by court order as being discriminatory against the disabled (i.e., particularly the speech- and/or hearing-impaired) who—along with the poor—might otherwise have no dependable way to report fires and emergencies if the alarm boxes were eliminated. (In addition, unlike many other cities in the world, it was noted that 117 different languages and dialects are spoken by the residents of and visitors to the city. Since, unlike telephones, a fire alarm box requires no verbal contact to indicate its exact location, a person would not have to be able to speak—at all—or to understand English in order to alert the FDNY or NYPD to a fire or other emergency. For this reason, as well, the boxes were recognized as being vital to New Yorkers&#x27; safety.) The court order to block the removal of the boxes provided a means for people to report emergencies during the 2003 blackout, when other forms of communication were cut off. The fire alarm boxes, independent of outside power, continued to function the entire time.
* &quot;Class 3&quot; alarms are less common than the first two means of reporting fires. A &quot;Class 3&quot; alarm is one of three numerical classes of alarms given by the FDNY&#x27;s Bureau of Communications to alert the fire department to automatic fire alarm systems, which are routed through commercial alarm companies. These firms monitor sprinkler systems, standpipes, smoke detectors, and internal pull-stations in non-public occupancies, such as: factories, warehouses, stores, and office buildings. When alarms are received from such accounts, these companies pass along the information to the FDNY central offices, usually by dedicated telephone circuits. The term &quot;Class 3&quot; was derived from the fact that the box number on such an assignment card would have a &quot;3&quot; preceding it, in addition to a &quot;terminal&quot; following it (e.g., &quot;3-7012-4&quot; would indicate a private alarm system in a commercial occupancy at a specific address, in the immediate vicinity of Box 7012, on the corner of Review Avenue and Laurel Hill Boulevard in Queens). In such cases, the type of alarm (e.g., sprinkler, smoke detector, interior pull-station, etc.) and an exact address—and, often, even a specific section of a building—would instantly be made available to responding units.)
* Verbal alarms are the least common means of reporting fires or emergencies, and generally involves civilians &quot;verbally&quot; making such reports directly to firehouses or fire companies. This can include incidents that are observed by fire units themselves when they are away from their quarters. However, &quot;verbal&quot; alarms may also be reported by EMS Bureau personnel, NYPD personnel, chief officers, Department officials (e.g., commissioners, medical officers, chaplains, et al.), or civilian employees of the FDNY (e.g., communications electricians, mechanics, dispatchers, etc.), who observe fires or emergencies in the course of the performance of their duties. If a fire company is available in quarters, it will immediately respond to the incident after advising the dispatchers of the same via telephone, voice alarm, or radio. If the unit is away from its firehouse (e.g., responding to or operating at another alarm, on inspection duty, etc.) at the time, the company will either stop at the new incident and operate, or the officer will request a separate assignment (as the reporting unit is unavailable to operate). Based on the information received by the dispatchers, the appropriate action (e.g., transmitting a new box, etc.) is initiated in regard to the new incident.

When a member of the public dials 911, the caller is connected to a police department operator, who assigns the call to where it needs to go based on the information provided.
* If it is police related, the information is sent to an NYPD radio dispatcher for the precinct or special unit concerned.
* If it is on a bridge or in a tunnel connected to New Jersey or at Kennedy or LaGuardia Airport, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is also notified.
* If it is a fire, haz-mat, or rescue incident, the 9-1-1 operator transfers the call by dedicated phone line to the appropriate FDNY communications dispatch office. (Depending on the type of incident, the NYPD may notify its own Emergency Service Units to respond instead of &quot;or&quot; along with the Fire Department.)
Fire alarm dispatchers handle comparatively few medical calls made directly to them, since the vast majority of such incidents are routed straight to the FDNY&#x27;s EMS communications office by the NYPD 9-1-1 operators. However, a medical call that requires the assistance of &quot;first-responder&quot;-trained fire units will have said request routed electronically to the appropriate fire alarm central office, for the assignment of the proper personnel and apparatus.

====Box numbers====
Each address in the city is assigned a box number, based on the closest street, special building, or highway box. The term &quot;box&quot; refers to the Fire Alarm Boxes, which at one time lined street corners and in front of certain buildings. Each Fire Alarm Box was given a specific number by the FDNY&#x27;s Bureau of Communications. Even if the physical fire alarm box is no longer at a specific address or street corner, the address or street corner is still assigned that fire alarm box&#x27;s number. Box numbers can be duplicated in different boroughs, which is why they are always identified by borough name or numerical prefix on the computer (66 for Bronx and Manhattan, 77 for Brooklyn, 88 for Staten Island and 99 for Queens). If there is also a street address given to the dispatchers, the responding apparatus will get this information in the firehouse, over the air, and via their mobile data terminals in the rigs—in addition to the Box number. At present, there are about 16,000 physical fire alarm street boxes in New York City, with many additional special building boxes and highway boxes, as well as &quot;dummy boxes&quot; used for special response assignments. In addition there are two airport crash boxes, one in the LaGuardia Tower, (Queens Box 37), and one in the JFK Tower, (Queens Box 269), which can only be activated by the personnel in these towers. When either box is sounded, it brings an automatic second alarm (2–2) response of equipment, along with various special units.

====Critical Information Dispatch System====
Critical Information Dispatch System (CIDS, pronounced by the dispatcher as &quot;Sids&quot;) data is transmitted to units in the firehouse and en route. It is information that is collected about a building during inspections and by public input, which would affect fire-fighting operations. For example:
* Warehoused apartments.
* Type and length of line stretch (or hose).
* Number of apartment units per floor.
* Unsafe conditions, standpipe conditions, and anything else the Bureau of Fire Communications or the FDNY Staff Chiefs deem important.

This information is printed on the fire ticket, and can be read by the dispatcher if requested. This information is also read automatically when a signal 10–75 (working fire) or higher signal is given, or when the supervising dispatcher deems it is important for the units to have it before arrival at an incident.

==== Radio and bell code signals ====
The New York City Fire Department utilizes a system of ten-code radio signals, in addition to an internal one involving &quot;bell codes&quot; (that their origin to the days when coded telegraph signals were sent over a closed, wired system within the Department) to transmit and relay information involving both emergency communications and general, Departmental operations. There are fifty-five &quot;10-codes&quot; used by the Department. There are also sub-codes specific to certain &quot;10-codes.&quot; The FDNY is currently one of the last, large fire departments in the country using &quot;10-Codes,&quot; as opposed to &quot;plain English,&quot; to communicate information by radio.

==Fire companies and specialty/support units==




The New York City Fire Department is made up of fire companies, similar to military companies. Each fire company operates a single type of Fire apparatus, and has four shifts of firefighters and company officers. Each company responds to emergency calls from one of the city&#x27;s 218 firehouses.

There are currently six different types of fire companies in the New York Fire Department, which all operate distinct types of apparatus: 197 engine companies, 143 ladder (or truck) companies, 5 rescue companies, 8 squad companies, 3 marine (or fireboat) companies, and the hazardous materials (hazmat) company. In addition to these six types of fire companies, there are numerous other specialized units that are operated by the Special Operations Command (S.O.C.), the Haz-Mat. Division, and the Marine Division. Each fire company has a specific role at the scene of an emergency.

Each type of fire company utilizes a certain type of fire apparatus, colloquially known as &quot;rigs&quot;. Engine companies may be known as “engines” and ladder companies may be known as “trucks.”

===Engine companies===
Engine Companies in the New York City Fire Department are tasked with fire suppression, which includes: securing a water supply from a fire hydrant, deploying handlines, then extinguishing a fire. These units respond to other emergencies as well.

There are 197 Engine Companies in the FDNY.

===Ladder companies (truck companies)===
Ladder Companies (also known as &quot;truck companies&quot;) in the New York City Fire Department are tasked with forcible entry, search and rescue, ventilation, and ladder-pipe operations at the scene of a fire. They also respond to a variety of specialized emergencies. A ladder company can operate three types of ladder trucks: a rear mounted aerial ladder truck, equipped with a 100&#x27; aerial ladder mounted at the rear of the apparatus; a tower ladder truck, equipped with either a 75&#x27; or 95&#x27; telescoping boom and bucket mounted in the center of the apparatus; and a tractor-drawn aerial ladder truck known as a &quot;hook and ladder&quot; truck, equipped with a 100&#x27; aerial ladder. A ladder company will be equipped with various forcible entry tools, ventilation equipment, and a variety of rescue tools, in addition to other tools and equipment to deal with an assortment of fires, technical rescues, and other emergencies, including motor vehicle accidents and other responses. There are 143 Ladder Companies in the FDNY.

===Rescue companies===
Rescue Companies in the New York City Fire Department are composed of specially-trained members who respond to and deal with a wide variety of rescue situations . A Rescue Company is tasked with responding to and dealing with specialized fire rescue incidents that are beyond the scope and duties of a standard engine company or ladder company. Rescue companies operate rescue trucks, nicknamed &quot;tool boxes on wheels,&quot; which carry a wide variety of specialized tools and equipment to aid in operations at technical rescue situations, such as: rope rescues, building collapse rescues, confined space rescues, trench/excavation rescues, machinery and vehicle extrication/rescues, water rescues and a variety of other technical rescue situations. They respond to all structure fires within their response district as well. There are 5 full-time Rescue Companies in the FDNY.

===Squad companies===
The Squad Companies are also composed of specially trained firefighters of the New York Fire Department. Squad companies were initially established by the FDNY to serve as &quot;manpower companies,&quot; to supplement the manpower and operations of engine companies and ladder companies. Today, squad companies can function as either engine companies or ladder companies at the scene of a fire or other emergencies, but they are also equipped with the same equipment and specialized tools as the Rescue Companies. In particular, members of a squad company are highly trained in mitigating hazardous materials (hazmat) incidents, supplementing the FDNY&#x27;s single hazmat company. There are 8 Squad Companies in the FDNY:
* Squad Company 1:Squad Company 1 serves northwestern, western and southern Brooklyn. Squad Company 1&#x27;s quarters are located at 788 Union St. in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn.

The FDNY hazardous materials (hazmat) company, Haz-Mat 1 (quartered in Queens), responds to all major citywide hazardous materials incidents, building collapses, contamination-related incidents, terrorism-related disasters, major emergencies, and a variety of other incidents in which their services may be needed. Like the Rescue Company and Squad Company Apparatus of the FDNY, members of Haz-Mat Company 1 are experienced and specially trained to deal with hazardous situations. The Haz-Mat company operates a Haz-Mat Truck, similar to a rescue truck, which carries a variety of equipment to deal with hazardous situations. Haz-Mat 1 also operates a smaller rescue truck which carries extra equipment not carried on the company&#x27;s main piece of apparatus. The Haz-Mat company is supplemented by the squad companies primarily, the rescue companies, and four HMTU engine companies whose members are certified Haz-Mat Technicians. These four engine companies, like the squad companies, also operate medium rescue trucks that carry hazmat equipment. Plugging equipment, Hazmat personal protective equipment, non sparking tools, and other equipment are carried on the Hazardous Materials apparatus.

===Fireboats (marine companies)===
In addition to its Engine Companies, Ladder (Truck) Companies, Squad Companies, Hazmat Company and Rescue Companies, FDNY operates three Class I fireboats as marine companies year round:
* Marine Company No. 1 – &quot;Three Forty Three&quot; covering the Hudson River.
* Marine Company No. 6 – &quot;Bravest&quot; covering the East River.
* Marine Company No. 9 – &quot;Fire Fighter II&quot; covering the New York Bay.
A * Marine Battalion which responds on all Maritime incidents when available, and several seasonal (Typically from Mid-May through Early-October) Class II Marine Companies :
* &quot;&#x27;Marine Company No. 3&quot; covering Jamaica Bay.
* &quot;&#x27;Marine Company No. 4&quot; covering Eastchester Bay.
* &quot;&#x27;Marine Company No. 8&quot; covering the Staten Island Shoreline.

Three older fireboats are kept in reserve: &quot;John D. McKean&quot;, &quot;Governor Alfred E. Smith,&quot; and &quot;Kevin C. Kane.&quot;
A former FDNY Marine Unit, the &quot;John J. Harvey&quot;, is notable as having returned to active service as Marine 2 on September 11, 2001, and providing firefighting services for 80 hours following the attack.

In 2010, the newly built fireboat, &quot;Three Forty Three,&quot; replaced the &quot;John D. McKean&quot;, which entered service in 1954, as Marine 1. A twin, 140-foot, vessel, &quot;Fire Fighter II&quot;, replaced &quot;Fire Fighter&quot;, dedicated in 1938, as Marine 9. The two new boats cost $60 million, funded by a grant from the Department of Homeland Security, and represented the city&#x27;s first major investment in new fireboats in 50 years. The $2.4 million &quot;Bravest,&quot; commissioned on May 26, 2011, is smaller than the other two Class I boats, at 65 feet, but is able to operate in shallower waters, including those near the city&#x27;s airports.

The department also has a fleet of approximately 14 smaller, class II fireboats, with ten 33-foot Rapid Response Fire, three 31-foot medical response, and one 33-foot SCUBA boats and other equipment that can be activated for use when needed .

===Volunteer departments===
Nine volunteer fire companies remain in New York City and respond to calls in their neighborhood, in addition to FDNY units. They are typically in more isolated neighborhoods of the city. By borough, the volunteer companies are:
* Bronx (1) – Edgewater Park Volunteer Hose Company No. 1
* Brooklyn (1) – Gerritsen Beach Fire Volunteers Inc.
* Queens (5) – West Hamilton Beach VFD, Broad Channel VFD, Roxbury VFD, Rockaway Point VFD, and Point Breeze VFD
* Staten Island (2) – Oceanic H&amp;L Company No. 1, Richmond Engine Co. 1

The Staten Island volunteer companies are dispatched by the Staten Island Communications Office and operate on the FDNY Staten Island frequency. Broad Channel and West Hamilton Beach have teleprinters in parallel with the FDNY fire companies that also serve their area. The Brooklyn and first four volunteer companies in Queens also provide ambulance services.

The nine volunteer fire departments supplement the FDNY, however, their services have sometimes proven essential. They are especially needed in urgent events, such as storms that can cause flooding conditions that prevent FDNY companies from reaching alarms promptly. Typically, the departments respond in addition to the initial assignment dispatched by the FDNY. The volunteer departments are fully trained and operational with the apparatus and equipment they have. Therefore, when they arrive to a scene first or when needed, they will implement their operations alongside FDNY as applicable.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
The Fire Department of New York has appeared a number of times within literature. &quot;Report from Engine Co. 82&quot;, &quot;20,000 Alarms&quot;, and &quot;The Last Men Out: Life on the Edge at Rescue 2 Firehouse&quot; are three of the most famous pieces of FDNY literature. In addition to memorials, the FDNY has produced a number of educational materials. One of these books is the 177 page &quot;Fire Department of New York- Forcible Entry Reference Guide- Techniques and Procedures&quot;.

===Film and television===
The New York City Fire Department has also appeared in numerous films and television shows. One of the earliest was the 1972 documentary &quot;Man Alive: The Bronx is Burning&quot;, for BBC Television. It was screened in the United Kingdom on September 27, 1972, and followed firefighters from a firehouse in the South Bronx: Battalion 27, Ladder 31 and Engine 82. It chronicled the appalling conditions the firefighters worked in with roughly one emergency call per hour, and the high rates of arson and malicious calls. The documentary focused heavily on firefighter Dennis Smith, who served in the South Bronx area and went on to write &quot;Report from Engine Co. 82&quot; and a number of other books. He has become a prominent speaker on firefighting policy.

In 1984 and 1989, the comedy films &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; used a firehouse for external shots of the Ghostbusters&#x27; headquarters building. Ladder Company 8&#x27;s house at 14 North Moore Street in Tribeca was reportedly chosen because writer Dan Aykroyd knew the area and liked the building. The interior of the Ghostbusters base was shot in a Los Angeles studio, and in Fire Station No. 23, a decommissioned Los Angeles firehouse. Ladder 8 has the sign from &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; mounted on the wall inside the house; fans of the franchise frequently stop by to take photos of the building and ask to pose with the sign.

In 1991, FDNY firefighter Brian Hickey and his brother Raymond produced a documentary entitled &quot;Firefighters: Brothers in Battle&quot;. The film features footage of fires and rescues throughout the five boroughs of New York City, including the Happy Land Social Club fire which killed 87 persons, dramatic rescues from a crashed airplane off of La Guardia Airport, and footage and interviews at Medal Day 1991. Raymond died of cancer in 1993 and Brian was killed on 9/11 while operating at the World Trade Center. Brian last served as the Captain of Rescue Company 4 in Queens.

The 2002 documentary film &quot;9/11&quot; is footage of the 9/11 attacks filmed by FDNY James Hanlon, a firefighter from Ladder Co. 1, and brothers Jules and Gedeon Naudet. It follows members of Engine 7/Ladder 1 and Battalion 1 on Duane Street in Lower Manhattan. The 2005 film &quot;Brotherhood: Life in the FDNY&quot;, focuses on Squad 252 in Brooklyn, Rescue 1 in Manhattan and Rescue 4 in Queens.

The 2002 &quot;Sesame Street&quot; video &quot;Elmo Visits the Firehouse&quot; revolves around Elmo paying a visit to Engine Company 58, Ladder Company 26 of the FDNY to learn all about how firefighters do their jobs and how to &quot;get low and go&quot;, after a fire at Hooper&#x27;s Store scares him.

A 2006 PBS documentary called &quot;Taking The Heat&quot; features the struggle of women to join the FDNY, and Brenda Berkman&#x27;s part in it.

Television series about FDNY have included &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, which ran from 2004 to 2011 and depicted the fictional life of firefighters in an FDNY firehouse. The NBC drama &quot;Third Watch&quot; ran from 1999 to 2005 and provided a fictionalized and dramatized depiction of the firefighters and paramedics of the FDNY and police officers of the New York City Police Department.

In 2015, the twenty-seventh season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; featured a tribute to the FDNY&#x27;s 150th anniversary.

The 2019 the semi-autobiographical film &quot;King of Staten Island&quot;, directed by and starring Pete Davidson, makes reference to Davidson&#x27;s father, Staten Island firefighter Scott Matthew Davidson while exploring the impact of his death in the September 11 attacks on his son.

<doc id="287736" wikidata="Q2525880" url="?curid=287736" title="Lectio difficilior potior">
<text>(Latin for &quot;the more difficult reading is the stronger&quot;) is a main principle of textual criticism. Where different manuscripts conflict on a particular reading, the principle suggests that the more unusual one is more likely the original. The presupposition is that scribes would more often replace odd words and hard sayings with more familiar and less controversial ones, than vice versa. &quot;Lectio difficilior potior&quot; is an internal criterion, which is independent of criteria for evaluating the manuscript in which it is found, and that it is as applicable to manuscripts of a &quot;roman courtois&quot;, a classical poet, or a Sanskrit epic as it is to a biblical text.

The principle was one among a number that became established in early 18th-century text criticism, as part of attempts by scholars of the Enlightenment to provide a neutral basis for discovering an &quot;&quot; that was independent of the weight of traditional authority.

==History==
Rabbeinu Tam (1100-1171) expressed the idea in his work &#x27;Sefer Hayashar&#x27;: 
&quot;ובעל התלמוד כתבו, שתלמידים המגיהים אינם מגיהים דברים של תימה&quot;
(&quot;it was written by the author of the Talmud, since students who correct the text do not correct it in order to make the text difficult&quot;, responsum 44).
Erasmus expressed the idea in his &quot;Annotations&quot; to the New Testament in the early 1500s: &quot;And whenever the Fathers report that there is a variant reading, that one always appears to me to be more esteemed (by them is the one) which at first glance seems the more absurd-since it is reasonable that a reader who is either not very learned or not very attentive was offended by the specter of absurdity and changed the text.&quot;

According to Paolo Trovato, who cites as source Sebastiano Timpanaro, the principle was first codified by Jean Leclerc in 1696 in his &quot;Ars critica&quot;.
It was also laid down by Johann Albrecht Bengel, as , in his &quot;Prodromus Novi Testamenti Graeci Rectè Cautèque Adornandi&quot;, 1725, and employed in his &quot;Novum Testamentum Graecum&quot;, 1734. It was widely promulgated by Johann Jakob Wettstein, to whom it is often attributed.

==Usefulness==
Many scholars considered the employment of an objective criterion that would even override other evaluative considerations. The poet and scholar A. E. Housman challenged such reactive applications in 1922, in the provocatively titled article &quot;The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism&quot;.

On the other hand, taken as an axiom, the principle produces an eclectic text, rather than one based on a history of manuscript transmission. &quot;Modern eclectic praxis operates on a variant unit basis without any apparent consideration of the consequences&quot;, Maurice A. Robinson warned. He suggested that to the principle &quot;should be added a corollary, difficult readings created by individual scribes do not tend to perpetuate in any significant degree within transmissional history&quot;.

A noted proponent of the superiority of the Byzantine text-type, the form of the Greek New Testament in the largest number of surviving manuscripts, Robinson would use the corollary to explain differences from the Majority Text as scribal errors that were not perpetuated because they were known to be errant or because they existed only in a small number of manuscripts &quot;at the time&quot;.

Most textual-critical scholars would explain the corollary by the assumption that scribes tended to &quot;correct&quot; harder readings and so cut off the stream of transmission. Thus, only earlier manuscripts would have the harder readings. Later manuscripts would not see the corollary principle as being a very important one to get closer to the original form of the text.

However, is not to be taken as an absolute rule either but as a general guideline. &quot;&quot;In general&quot; the more difficult reading is to be preferred&quot; is Bruce Metzger&#x27;s reservation. &quot;There is truth in the maxim: (&#x27;the more difficult reading is the more probable reading&#x27;)&quot;, write Kurt and Barbara Aland.

However, for scholars like Kurt Aland, who follow a path of reasoned eclecticism based on evidence both internal and external to the manuscripts, &quot;this principle must not be taken too mechanically, with the most difficult reading () adopted as original simply because of its degree of difficulty&quot;. Also, Martin Litchfield West cautions: &quot;When we choose the &#x27;more difficult reading&#x27;... we must be sure that it is in itself a plausible reading. The principle should not be used in support of dubious syntax, or phrasing that it would not have been natural for the author to use. There is an important difference between a more &quot;difficult&quot; reading and a more &quot;unlikely&quot; reading&quot;.

Responding to Tetyana Vilkul&#x27;s review of his 2003 critical edition of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; (PVL), Donald Ostrowski (2005) phrased the principle as follows: &#x27;The more difficult reading is preferred to a smoother reading, except, again, where a mechanical copying error would explain the roughness. The rationale is that a copyist is more likely to have tried to make a rough reading smoother than to have made a smooth reading more difficult to understand.&#x27;

<text>James Simon Wallis Hunt (29 August 1947 – 15 June 1993) was a British racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to . Nicknamed &quot;the Shunt&quot;, Hunt won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with McLaren, and won 10 Grands Prix across seven seasons.

Born and raised in Surrey, Hunt began his racing career in touring cars before progressing to Formula Three in 1969, where he attracted the attention of Lord Hesketh, founder of Hesketh Racing. Hunt earned notoriety throughout his early career for his reckless and action-packed exploits on track, amongst his playboy lifestyle off it. He signed for Hesketh in —driving a March 731 chassis designed by Harvey Postlethwaite—making his Formula One debut at the ; he took podiums in his rookie season at the Dutch and United States Grands Prix. Hesketh entered their own 308 chassis in , in which Hunt achieved several further podiums and won the non-championship BRDC International Trophy.

Retaining his seat the following season, Hunt took his maiden victory with Hesketh at the , widely regarded as one of the greatest underdog victories in Formula One history. The team was left without sponsorship at the end of the season, leading Hunt to join McLaren for his campaign. Amidst a fierce title battle with Niki Lauda, Hunt won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship by a single point in his debut season with McLaren. He won several further races in , dropping to fifth in the standings amidst reliability issues. After a winless season for McLaren in , Hunt moved to Wolf and retired after the 1979 Monaco Grand Prix, having achieved 10 race wins, 14 pole positions, eight fastest laps and 23 podiums in Formula One.

Upon retiring from motor racing, Hunt established a career as a commentator and pundit for the BBC, as well as a columnist for &quot;The Independent&quot;. Through Marlboro, he also mentored two-time World Drivers&#x27; Champion Mika Häkkinen. He died from a heart attack at his home in Wimbledon, aged 45.

==Early life==
Hunt was born in Belmont, Surrey, the second child of Wallis Glynn Gunthorpe Hunt (1922–2001), a stockbroker, and Susan (Sue) Noel Wentworth () Hunt. He had an elder sister, Sally, three younger brothers, Peter, Timothy and David, and one younger sister, Georgina. Wallis Hunt was descended on his mother&#x27;s side from the industrialist and politician Sir William Jackson, 1st Baronet. Hunt&#x27;s family lived in a flat in Cheam, Surrey, moved to Sutton when he was 11 and then to a larger home in Belmont. He attended Westerleigh Preparatory School, St Leonards-on-Sea Sussex and later Wellington College.

Hunt first learned to drive on a tractor on a farm in Pembrokeshire, Wales, while on a family holiday, with instruction from the farm&#x27;s owner, but he found changing gears frustrating because he lacked the required strength. Hunt passed his driving test one week after his seventeenth birthday, at which point he said his life &quot;really began&quot;. He also took up skiing in 1965 in Scotland, and made plans for further ski trips. Before his eighteenth birthday, he went to the home of Chris Ridge, his tennis doubles partner. Ridge&#x27;s brother Simon, who raced Minis, was preparing his car for a race at Silverstone that weekend. The Ridges took Hunt to see the race, which began his obsession with motor racing.

==Early career==
===Mini racing===
Hunt&#x27;s racing career started off in a racing Mini. He first entered a race at the Snetterton Circuit in Norfolk, but race scrutineers prevented him from competing, deeming the Mini to have many irregularities, which left Hunt and his team mate, Justin Fry, upset. Hunt later brought the necessary funding from working as a trainee manager of a telephone company to enter three events. At this point Fry made the decision to part company with the team, owing to the irregularities and modifications that were happening to the cars they were using.

===Formula Ford===
Hunt graduated to Formula Ford in 1968. He drove a Russell-Alexis Mark 14 car bought through a hire-purchase scheme. In his first race at Snetterton, Hunt had lost 15 hp from an incorrect engine ignition setting, but managed to finish fifth. Hunt took his first win at Lydden Hill and also set the lap record on the Brands Hatch short circuit.

===Formula Three===

In 1969, Hunt raced in Formula Three with a budget, provided by Gowrings of Reading, which bought a Merlyn Mark 11A. Gowrings intended to run the car in the final two races of 1968. Hunt won several races and achieved regular high-placed finishes, which led to the British Guild of Motoring Writers awarding him a Grovewood Award as one of the three drivers judged to have promising careers.

Hunt was involved in a controversial incident with Dave Morgan during a battle for second position in the Formula Three Daily Express Trophy race at Crystal Palace on 3 October 1970. Having banged wheels earlier in a very closely fought race, Morgan attempted to pass Hunt on the outside of South Tower Corner on the final lap, but instead the cars collided and crashed out of the race. Hunt&#x27;s car came to rest in the middle of the track, minus two wheels. Hunt got out, ran over to Morgan and furiously pushed him to the ground, which earned him severe official disapproval. Both men were summoned by the RAC and after hearing evidence from other drivers, Hunt was cleared by a tribunal and Morgan was given a 12-month suspension of his racing licence, but was subsequently allowed to progress to Formula Atlantic in 1971. Hunt later met with John Hogan and racing driver Gerry Birrell to obtain sponsorship from Coca-Cola.

Hunt&#x27;s career continued in the works March team for 1972. His first race at Mallory Park saw him finish third, but he was told by race officials he had been excluded from the results, as his engine was deemed to be outside the regulations. The car, however, passed tests at the next two races at Brands Hatch. In these races, Hunt finished fourth and fifth respectively. He collided with two cars at Oulton Park but finished third at Mallory Park after a long duel with Roger Williamson. The cars did not appear at Zandvoort, but Hunt still attended the race as a spectator.

In May 1972, it was announced by the team that he had been dropped from the STP-March Formula 3 team and replaced by Jochen Mass. When Hunt attempted to contact March, he was unable to get any response from his employers. Hunt decided to consult Chris Marshall, his former team manager, who explained that a spare car was available. This followed a period characterised by a series of mechanical failures. Hunt decided, against the express instructions of March director Max Mosley, to race at Monaco in a March from a different team. This had been vacated by driver Jean-Claude Alzerat, after Hunt&#x27;s own March had first broken down and then been hit by another competitor in a practice lap.

==Formula One career==
===1973–1975: Hesketh===
;1973
Hesketh purchased a March 731 chassis, and it was developed by Harvey Postlethwaite. The team was initially not taken seriously by rivals, who saw the Hesketh team as party goers enjoying the glamour of Formula One. However, the Hesketh March proved much more competitive than the works March cars, and their best result was second place at the 1973 United States Grand Prix. Hunt also made a brief venture into sports car racing at the 1973 Kyalami Nine Hours, driving a Mirage M6 along with Derek Bell, finishing second.

After the season&#x27;s end, Hunt was awarded with the Campbell Trophy from the RAC marking his performance in Formula One as the best by a British driver.
;1974
For the season, Hesketh Racing built a car, inspired by the March, called the Hesketh 308, but an accompanying V12 engine never materialised. Hunt&#x27;s first test of the car came at Silverstone and found it more stable than its predecessor, the March 731. Hunt was retained on a £15,000 salary. The Hesketh team captured the public imagination as a car without sponsors&#x27; markings, a teddy-bear badge and a devil-may-care team ethos, which belied the fact that their engineers were highly competent professionals. In Argentina, Hunt qualified fifth and led briefly before being overtaken by Ronnie Peterson before Hunt spun off the track and eventually retired due to engine failure. In South Africa, Hunt retired from fifth place with a broken driveshaft. Hunt&#x27;s season highlight was a victory at the BRDC International Trophy non-championship race at Silverstone, against the majority of the regular F1 field.
;1975

Hunt finished sixth in Brazil and retired with an engine failure in South Africa. In Spain, Hunt led the first six laps before colliding with a barrier with the same cause of retirement in Monaco. He had a further two retirements in Belgium and Sweden, both of which were due to mechanical failures. Hunt&#x27;s first win came in the 1975 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort. He finished fourth in the Championship that year, but Lord Hesketh had run out of funds and could not find a sponsor for his team. With little time left before the season, Hunt was desperately looking for a drive until Emerson Fittipaldi left McLaren and joined his brother&#x27;s Copersucar-Fittipaldi outfit. With no other top drivers available, the team management signed Hunt to McLaren – in a deal brokered by Marlboro&#x27;s John Hogan – for the next season on a contract involving a $50,000 retainer and a good share of the prize money.

===1976–1978: McLaren===

;1976
The season proved to be one of the most dramatic and controversial on record. While Hunt&#x27;s performances in the Hesketh had drawn considerable praise, there was some speculation as to whether he could really sustain a championship challenge. Now a works McLaren driver, he dispelled many doubters at the first race in Brazil, where, in a hastily rebuilt McLaren M23, he landed pole position in the last minutes of qualifying. Over the course of the year he would drive the McLaren M23 to six Grands Prix wins, but with superior reliability reigning world champion and main rival Niki Lauda had pulled out a substantial points lead in the first few races of the season. Hunt&#x27;s first race win of 1976, at the fourth race of the season, the Spanish Grand Prix, resulted in disqualification for driving a car adjudged to be 1.8 cm too wide. The win was later reinstated upon appeal, but it set the tone for an extraordinarily volatile season. At the British Grand Prix, Hunt was involved in a first corner incident on the first lap with Lauda which led to the race being stopped and restarted. Hunt initially attempted to take a spare car, however this was disallowed, and during this time the original race car was repaired, eventually winning the restarted race. Hunt&#x27;s victory was disallowed on 24 September by a ruling from the FIA after Ferrari complained that Hunt was not legally allowed to restart the race.

Lauda sustained near-fatal injuries in an accident at the following round, the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. Hunt dominated the restarted Nürburgring race, building an immediate lead and remaining unchallenged to the chequered flag.

Lauda&#x27;s injuries kept him out of the following two races, allowing Hunt to close the gap in the championship chase. At Zandvoort, Hunt overtook Ronnie Peterson on the 12th lap and resisted pressure from John Watson to win. At the Italian Grand Prix, the big story was Lauda&#x27;s miraculous return from his Nürburgring accident. At a circuit that should have suited Hunt&#x27;s car, the Texaco fuel McLaren were using was tested and although apparently legal, their cars, and those of the Penske team, were judged to contain a higher octane level than allowed. Subsequently, both teams were forced to start from the rear of the grid. While trying to make his way up the field, Hunt spun off, and Lauda finished fourth. At the next round in Canada, Hunt found out that he had been disqualified from the British Grand Prix and Lauda had been awarded the victory and thus received three additional points. A furious Hunt drove a very hard race at the challenging Mosport Park circuit and won. At the penultimate round in the United States at the daunting Watkins Glen track, Hunt started from pole and took victory after a close battle with Jody Scheckter.
This set the stage for the final round in Japan. Hunt&#x27;s late season charge pulled him to just three points behind Lauda. The sliding scale of points for the top six finishers meant that Hunt needed to finish fourth (worth 3 points) or better to overtake Lauda in the championship. Lauda needed to earn two points fewer than Hunt, or better, to stay ahead. McLaren team manager Alastair Caldwell had taken advantage of the gap between the final two races to hire the Fuji circuit – a track hosting its first Grand Prix and therefore unknown to all the teams – for an exclusive McLaren test. After a few laps the gearbox seized, bringing the test to a premature close, but the team had had the advantage of acclimatising themselves to the new circuit. Conditions for the race itself were torrentially wet. Lauda retired early on in the race, unable to blink because of facial burns from his accident in Germany. After leading most of the race Hunt suffered a puncture, then had a delayed pitstop and finally received mixed pit signals from his team. But he managed to finish in third place, scoring four points, enough for him to win the World Championship by one point. Hunt was the last British Formula One champion until Nigel Mansell won the 1992 championship for Williams. He was, relatively, one of the cheapest F1 World Champions ever, having signed at the last minute for $200,000 – a scenario similar to that of 1982 champion Keke Rosberg.
;1977
Before the start of 1977, Hunt attended a gala function at the Europa Hotel in London where he was awarded the Tarmac Trophy, along with two cheques, for £2000 and £500 respectively, a magnum of champagne and other awards. The presentation was made by the Duke of Kent. Hunt made an acceptance speech after the event which was considered &quot;suitably gracious and glamorous&quot;. The media were critical of Hunt as he attended the event dressed in jeans, T-shirt and a decrepit windbreaker.

Before the South African Grand Prix, Hunt was confronted by customs officials who searched his luggage, finding no illegal substances except a publication that contravened the strict obscenity laws of South Africa. Hunt was later released, and tested at Kyalami where his McLaren M26 suffered a loose brake caliper which cut a hole in one of the tyres. He recovered and put the car on pole position. The race saw Hunt suffer a collision with Jody Scheckter&#x27;s Wolf and another with Patrick Depailler&#x27;s Tyrrell, but he still managed to finish fourth.

The season did not start well for Hunt. The McLaren M26 was problematic in the early part of the season, during which Niki Lauda, Mario Andretti and Jody Scheckter took a considerable lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Towards the end of the year Hunt and the McLaren M26 were quicker than any rival combination other than Mario Andretti and the Lotus 78. Hunt won in Silverstone after trailing the Brabham of John Watson for 25 laps. He then took a further victory at Watkins Glen. At the Canadian Grand Prix, Hunt retired after a collision with team-mate Jochen Mass and was fined $2000 for assaulting a marshal and $750 for walking back to the pit lane in an &quot;unsafe manner&quot;. In Fuji, Hunt won the race but did not attend the podium ceremony resulting in a fine of $20,000. He finished fifth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship.

;1978
Before the season Hunt had high hopes to win a second world championship; however, in this season he scored only eight world championship points. Lotus had developed effective ground effect aerodynamics with their Lotus 79 car and McLaren were slow to respond. The M26 was revised as a ground effect car midway through the season but it did not work, and without a test driver to solve the car&#x27;s problems, Hunt&#x27;s motivation was low. His inexperienced new team-mate Patrick Tambay even outqualified Hunt at one race. In Germany, Hunt was disqualified for taking a shortcut to allow for a tyre change.

Hunt was also greatly affected by Ronnie Peterson&#x27;s fatal crash in the 1978 Italian Grand Prix. At the start of the race there was a huge accident going into the first corner. Peterson&#x27;s Lotus was pushed into the barriers and burst into flames. Hunt, together with Patrick Depailler and Clay Regazzoni, rescued Peterson from the car, but Peterson died one day later in hospital. Hunt took his friend&#x27;s death particularly hard and for years afterwards blamed Riccardo Patrese for the accident. He never forgave Patrese for the crash. Video evidence of the crash has since shown that Patrese did not touch Hunt or Peterson&#x27;s cars, nor did he cause any other car to do so. Hunt believed that it was Patrese&#x27;s muscling past that caused the McLaren and Lotus to touch, but Patrese argues that he was already well ahead of the pair before the accident took place.

===1979: Walter Wolf Racing===

For , Hunt had resolved to leave the McLaren team. Despite his poor season in 1978 he was still very much in demand. Harvey Postlethwaite persuaded Hunt to join Walter Wolf Racing – a one-car team where he would have found an atmosphere similar to the one he had experienced at Hesketh at the beginning of his career. Again he had high hopes to win races and compete for the world championship in what would be his last, and ultimately brief, Formula One season. The team&#x27;s ground effect car was uncompetitive and Hunt soon lost any enthusiasm for racing. Hunt could only watch as Jody Scheckter won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship that year driving the Ferrari 312T4.

At the first race in Argentina, he felt the car was difficult to handle and on a fast lap, the front wing became detached striking his helmet. In the race, Hunt retired due to an electrical fault. In Brazil, he retired on lap 6 due to instability under braking caused by a loose steering rack. During qualifying in South Africa, the brakes on his car failed. He managed not to collide with the wall, but only finished 8th in the race. He retired at the Spanish Grand Prix after 26 laps. At Zolder, a new Wolf WR8 was raced but Hunt crashed into a barrier hard enough to bounce back onto the track. After failing to finish the 1979 Monaco Grand Prix, the race where six years previously he had made his debut, Hunt made a statement on 8 June 1979 to the press announcing his immediate retirement from F1 competition, citing his situation in the championship, and was replaced by future world champion Keke Rosberg. Despite going into retirement, he continued to work to promote his personal sponsors Marlboro and Olympus. According to Peter Warr, Hunt had been badly affected by the Ronnie Peterson accident in Monza the year before and his heart was no longer in it. Warr recalled Hunt telling him that he discovered that if he nudged the car up against the barrier and give it a squirt of throttle in second gear, it would break a driveshaft. &quot;At Monaco, four laps into the race, James stopped up the hill by Rosie&#x27;s bar, with a broken driveshaft. Then he told us he was retiring.&quot;

==Later career (1979–1993)==
===Commentary career===
Soon after retirement, in 1979, Hunt was approached by Jonathan Martin, the head of BBC television sport, to become a television commentator alongside Murray Walker on the BBC 2 Formula One racing programme &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. After a guest commentary at the 1979 British Grand Prix, Hunt accepted the position and continued for thirteen years until his death. During his first live broadcast at the 1980 Monaco Grand Prix, Hunt placed his plaster-cast leg into Walker&#x27;s lap and drank two bottles of wine during the broadcast. Hunt regularly went into the booth minutes before a race started, which concerned Martin, who believed that Hunt was &quot;a guy that lived on adrenaline.&quot;

In the commentary booth, the producers supplied only one microphone to Walker and Hunt, to avoid them talking over each other. On one occasion, Hunt wanted the microphone and went up to Walker, who had continued for longer than expected, and grabbed him by the collar, with Walker having his fist near to Hunt. On another occasion, Hunt grabbed the microphone cord and cracked it like a whip, which yanked the microphone out of Walker&#x27;s hand. His insights and dry sense of humour brought him a new fanbase. He often heavily criticised drivers he did not think were trying hard enough – during the BBC&#x27;s live broadcast of the 1989 Monaco Grand Prix he described René Arnoux&#x27;s comments that non-turbo cars did not suit the Frenchman&#x27;s driving skills as &quot;bullshit&quot;. He also had a reputation for speaking out against back-markers who held up race leaders.

Other than Arnoux, Hunt&#x27;s other frequent targets included Andrea de Cesaris, Philippe Alliot, Jean-Pierre Jarier and Riccardo Patrese. Hunt criticised Jean-Pierre Jarier for blocking leaders, calling him &quot;pig ignorant&quot;, a &quot;French wally&quot; and having a &quot;mental age of ten&quot; during live broadcasts. Hunt further suggested that Jarier should be banned from racing &quot;for being himself&quot;.

Hunt did not want his commentaries broadcast in South Africa during the apartheid years but when he could not stop this from happening, he gave his fees to black-led groups working to overthrow apartheid.

Hunt also commented on Grand Prix racing in newspaper columns which were published in &quot;The Independent&quot; and elsewhere, and in magazines.

===Attempted comebacks===
In 1980, Hunt nearly made a comeback with McLaren at the United States Grand Prix West, asking for $1 million for the race. This opportunity came about when regular driver Alain Prost broke his wrist during practice for the previous round in South Africa, and the French rookie was not fully fit to drive at Long Beach. The team&#x27;s main sponsor, Marlboro, offered half the figure but negotiations ended after Hunt broke his leg while skiing. In 1982 Bernie Ecclestone, owner of the Brabham team, offered Hunt a salary of £2.6 million for the season but was rejected by Hunt. In 1990, Hunt was in financial trouble with the loss of £180,000 investing in Lloyd&#x27;s of London and considered a comeback with the Williams team. He had tested on the Paul Ricard Circuit a few months prior to test modern cars and was several seconds off the pace and believed he would be physically prepared. Hunt attempted to persuade John Hogan, VP Marketing of Philip Morris Europe, to support the possible comeback, and presented him with bank statement for proof of being indebted.

===Other projects===
Hunt made a brief appearance in the 1979 British silent slapstick comedy &quot;The Plank&quot;, as well as co-starring with Fred Emney in a Texaco Havoline TV advertisement. He also made a posthumous appearance on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Police Camera Action!&quot; special &quot;Crash Test Racers&quot; in 2000; this was one of many interviews to be aired posthumously. Hunt also competed in an exhibition race to mark the opening of the new Nürburgring in May 1984. Despite having no licence to ride a motorcycle, he accepted, instead of his usual fee, the then-new 1980 electric start Triumph Bonneville he had contracted to advertise on behalf of the struggling Triumph motorcycle workers&#x27; co-operative. With journalistic mirth, he turned up at the press launch with his foot in plaster.

Hunt was hired by John Hogan as an adviser and tutor to drivers who were sponsored by Marlboro, instructing them in the tactics of driving and the approach to racing. Mika Häkkinen and Hunt had discussions about not only racing but about life in general.

==Personal life==
Early in their careers, Hunt and Niki Lauda were friends off the track. Lauda occasionally stayed at Hunt&#x27;s flat when he had nowhere to sleep for the night. In his autobiography &quot;To Hell and Back&quot;, Lauda described Hunt as an &quot;open, honest to God pal.&quot; Lauda admired Hunt&#x27;s burst of speed, while Hunt admired Lauda&#x27;s capacity for analysis and rigour. In the spring of 1974, Hunt moved to Spain on the advice of the International Management Group. Whilst living there as a tax exile, Hunt was the neighbour of Jody Scheckter, and they also came to be very good friends, with Hunt giving Scheckter the nickname Fletcher after the crash-prone bird in the book &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot;. Another close friend was Ronnie Peterson who was a quiet and shy man, whilst Hunt was the opposite, but their contrasting personalities made them very close off the track. It was Hunt who discovered Gilles Villeneuve, whom he met after being soundly beaten by him in a Formula Atlantic race in 1976. Hunt then arranged for the young Canadian to make his Grand Prix debut with McLaren in 1977.

Hunt claimed to have slept with 5000 women. He was involved in a relationship with Taormina Rieck (known as Ping by her friends) from the age of 15. Rieck separated from Hunt in May 1971, which left Hunt not seeing his family or friends for long periods of time.
Hunt met his first wife, Suzy Miller, in 1974 in Spain. A few weeks after their initial meeting, he proposed. The couple married on 18 October 1974 at the Brompton Oratory in Knightsbridge. By the end of 1975, Suzy had left Hunt for the actor Richard Burton.

In 1982, Hunt moved to Wimbledon. In September that year, he met his second wife, Sarah Lomax, while she was on a holiday in Spain with friends. Hunt started dating Lomax when she arrived back in Britain, and they dated throughout the winter. Hunt and Lomax were married on 17 December 1983 in Marlborough, Wiltshire. Hunt arrived late for the service, with proceedings delayed further when his brother Peter went to a shop to purchase a tie for him. The marriage resulted in two children, Tom and Freddie, the latter of whom is also a racing driver.

On a visit to Doncaster, Hunt was arrested for an assault, which was witnessed by two police officers, and was released on bail after two hours with the charges against him later being dropped. Hunt and Lomax separated in October 1988 but continued to live together for the best interests of their children. They were divorced in November 1989 on the grounds of adultery committed by Hunt.

Hunt met Helen Dyson in the winter of 1989 in a restaurant in Wimbledon, where she worked as a waitress. Dyson was 18 years Hunt&#x27;s junior and worried about her parents&#x27; reactions to him. Hunt kept the relationship secret from friends. The relationship brought new happiness to Hunt&#x27;s life, among other factors which included his clean health, his bicycle, his casual approach to dress, his two sons and his Austin A35 van. The day before he died, Hunt proposed to Dyson via telephone.

==Death==
Hunt died in his sleep on the morning of 15 June 1993 of a heart attack at his home in Wimbledon. He was 45 years old.

At his funeral service, the pallbearers included his father Wallis, his brothers Tim, Peter and David, and his friend Anthony &#x27;Bubbles&#x27; Horsley. They carried the coffin out of the church and into the hearse, which drove two miles to Putney Vale Crematorium, where he was cremated. After the service, most of the mourners went to Peter Hunt&#x27;s home to open a 1922 claret, the year of Wallis Hunt&#x27;s birth. The claret had been given to him by James on his 60th birthday in 1982.

==Legacy==

Hunt was known as a fast driver with an aggressive, tail-happy driving style, but one prone to spectacular accidents, hence his nickname of &quot;Hunt the Shunt&quot;. In reality, while Hunt was not necessarily any more accident-prone than his rivals in the lower formulae, the rhyme stuck and stayed with him. In the book &quot;James Hunt: The Biography&quot;, John Hogan said of Hunt: &quot;James was the only driver I&#x27;ve ever seen who had the vaguest idea about what it actually takes to be a racing driver.&quot; Niki Lauda stated that &quot;We were big rivals, especially at the end of the [1976] season, but I respected him because you could drive next to him—2 centimetres, wheel-by-wheel, for 300 kilometres or more—and nothing would happen. He was a real top driver at the time.&quot;

After winning the world championship in 1976, Hunt inspired many teenagers to take up motor racing, and he was retained by Marlboro to give guidance and support to up and coming drivers in the lower formulae. In early 2007, Formula One driver and 2007 World Champion Kimi Räikkönen entered and won a snowmobile race in his native Finland under the name James Hunt. Räikkönen has openly admired the lifestyles of 1970s race car drivers such as Hunt. Hunt&#x27;s name was lent to the James Hunt Racing Centre in Milton Keynes when it opened in 1990.

A Celebration of the Life of James Hunt was held on 29 September 1993 at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly. The service was attended by 600 people and on 29 January 2014 James Hunt was inducted into the Motor Sport Hall of Fame.

==Helmet==
Hunt&#x27;s helmet featured his name in bold letters along with blue, yellow and red stripes on both sides and room for the sponsor Goodyear, all set on a black background. Additionally, the blue, yellow and red bands resemble his Wellington College school colours. During his comeback year to Formula One in 2012, 2007 World Champion Kimi Räikkönen sported a helmet with the James Hunt&#x27;s name printed on it during the Monaco Grand Prix. Räikkönen repeated the tribute at the 2013 Monaco Grand Prix.

==In popular culture==
The 1976 F1 battle between Niki Lauda and James Hunt was dramatised in the 2013 film &quot;Rush&quot;, in which Hunt was played by Chris Hemsworth. In the film, Lauda said of Hunt&#x27;s death, &quot;When I heard he&#x27;d died aged 45 of a heart attack I wasn&#x27;t surprised, I was just sad.&quot; He also said that Hunt was one of the very few people he liked, a smaller number he respected and the only one he had envied.

A fictional depiction of Hunt, voiced by his son Tom, appeared as a James Bond-esque secret agent in McLaren&#x27;s &quot;Tooned&quot; cartoon to commemorate McLaren&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2013.

The 2024 &quot;Senna&quot; miniseries, which follows the racing career of Ayrton Senna, prominently features Hunt, portrayed by Leon Ockenden, in his years as a commentator.

<text>Prasanthi Nilayam (, above sea level) is the main ashram and Samadhi Mandir of Sathya Sai Baba located in the town of Puttaparthi in, Sri Sathya Sai district Andhra Pradesh, India. Sathya Sai Baba was born in Puttaparthi. &quot;Prasanthi Nilayam&quot; means literally &quot;Abode of the Highest Peace.&quot; Sathya Sai Baba gave daily darshan to his devotees in this ashram. Sathya Sai Baba was usually present in Prasanthi Nilayam from early June to the middle of March.

==History==
At the age of seventeen, Sathya Sai Baba told one devotee, &quot;The Sai Pravesh (the advent of Sai) will transform that region into Prasanti Pradesh (a region of highest peace). There will rise a bhavan (mansion)! Lakhs of people from all over India, why only India, from all over the world, will come and wait there for Sai darshan!&quot;

In 1944, a mandir was built to facilitate the growing number of Sai Baba devotees. It is now commonly referred to as the &quot;old mandir.&quot; Prasanti Nilayam was inaugurated on 23 November 1950, the 24th birthday of Sathya Sai Baba and its construction lasted about two years &quot;Sathya Sai Baba can be said to be the architect and engineer who directed the entire work for construction&quot;, says Narayana Kasturi. Sathya Sai Baba supervised the construction, acquiring of equipment, and watched over the devotees who constructed the ashram.&quot; Heavy girders for the central prayer hall was transported from Tiruchirappalli by train to Penukonda and then had to be brought over the district road, sixteen miles long.&quot; The mandir was painted blue, yellow, and pink &quot;communicating the message of the harmony of spirit, intellect, and heart respectively; for blue stands for spirit, yellow for intellect, and pink for heart (love). The rich harmony of the three does result in Santi (peace) and Prasanti (supreme peace); and that really is the message of the Prasanti Mandir.&quot; In October 1957, a hospital was inaugurated on the hill behind the ashram.&quot;

Poornachandra Auditorium was built in 1973 where cultural programmes, conferences and yagnas during Dasara take place.&quot; It can seat around 15,000 people in the 60 x 40-metre area. Sathya Sai Baba&#x27;s living quarters are upstairs above the stage.&quot;

The Sarva Dharma Stupa, a 50 ft high pillar celebrating the unity of all religions, was built in November 1975 to mark the advent of the Avatar.&quot; Sai Kulwant Hall with a seating capacity of about 20,000 is where daily darshan took place. Sai Kulwant Hall is between Sathya Sai Baba&#x27;s residence (Yajur Mandir) and the Prasanti Mandir. The carved icons of Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman were installed by Sathya Sai Baba on 30 September 1999.

The Prasanti Nilayam ashram hosts many mandirs including a Ganesha Mandir, Subramanya Mandir, Gayatri Mandir, a meditation tree planted by Sai Baba in 1950, an eternal heritage museum, Chaitanya Jyoti museum), multiple canteens, cricket ground, indoor sports stadium, super specialty hospital, educational institutions, shopping complex, administration buildings, devotee quarters, accommodation rooms and halls.

<text>A.D. Vision Holdings, Inc. (known simply as ADV and also referred to as ADV Films) was an American multimedia entertainment distributor headquartered in Houston, Texas, and founded in 1992 by video game fan John Ledford and anime fans Matt Greenfield and David Williams. The company specialized in home video production and distribution, theatrical film distribution, merchandising, original productions, magazine and comic book publishing. They also ran Anime Network, a television channel devoted to airing the company&#x27;s titles. Some of their titles were &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot;, &quot;RahXephon&quot;, &quot;Full Metal Panic&quot;, &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;, &quot;Elfen Lied&quot;, &quot;Gantz&quot;, &quot;Red Garden&quot;, and &quot;Le Chevalier D&#x27;Eon&quot;.

The company maintained offices in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition to North America, ADV Films distributed their home media releases in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany. The company was also involved in various lawsuits with other companies, though none of them made it to court.

With declining fortunes in the mid-2000s due to low sales, ADV ceased all operations and eventually liquidated their assets in 2009. Sentai Holdings, owner of Section23 Films, Sentai Filmworks, AEsir Holdings, Valkyrie Media Partners, and Seraphim Digital, took over the ADV brand name and still uses it on some of their releases. Most of ADV&#x27;s former titles have been re-released by other companies. Sentai was subsequently acquired by AMC Networks in 2022. As of 2025, ADV exists as a domiciled shell corporation.

== History ==
===Beginnings===
John Ledford, a native of Houston, Texas, started a Japanese video game and video console import business in 1990. He was introduced to anime when he watched &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; at his friend&#x27;s suggestion. At the time, Matt Greenfield, born in Sacramento, California, ran a local anime club called Anime NASA, which also included classmate David Williams. After consulting with Ledford, Greenfield joined him and Williams to found A.D. Vision, which officially opened for business on August 17, 1992. Ledford contacted Toho about optioning the rights to license &quot;Devil Hunter Yohko&quot;. Shozo Watanabe, the general manager of Toho&#x27;s Los Angeles office, expressed concern that A.D. Vision would not be able to handle the distribution of the film. Unable to find another distributor, Toho convinced A.D. Vision to license the series. That December, &quot;Devil Hunter Yohko&quot; became the first title to be released by A.D. Vision.

In 2007, Japan&#x27;s Sojitz announced that Japan Content Investments (JCI), an investment group run by Sojitz, Development Bank of Japan, and film distribution company KlockWorx, planned to contribute money to A.D. Vision, in return for equity in the company. Ledford was to remain the majority shareholder and CEO. JCI subsidiary ARM also planned to contribute money for ADV to use in acquiring new distribution licenses. The investment was to ADV Films to raise its output of new anime titles, which had dropped in 2006, back to previous levels or above. In return, ADV planned to assist Sojitz with the acquisition of North American and European content for importation into Japan. According to ADV, they also reportedly had &quot;big plans&quot; for its manga line.

=== Partnerships and acquisitions ===
In August 2007, a notice was sent to retailers stating that ADV Films would be taking over the distribution, marketing, and sales of Geneon properties in the US as of October 1. In preparation, Geneon USA laid off most of its sales division; however, in September the distribution deal was canceled. Dentsu confirmed that the distribution deal was canceled through a press release on September 21, 2007 with no reasons given except that Geneon and ADV were &quot;unable to reach a mutual agreement.&quot;

In June 2006, 20% of ADV Films was acquired by the Japanese Sojitz Corporation. This was done as a means of acquiring more titles in the Japanese market. From this point on, virtually all titles that ADV acquired were under Sojitz&#x27;s ownership. However, in January 2008, ADV mysteriously removed a large number of titles from their website. All the titles removed were titles acquired since the Sojitz acquisition including &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot;, which had test disks sent out with dubbed episodes. As of May 2008, &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot; was licensed by Bandai Entertainment. ADV Films made booth appearances at the Anime Central 2008 convention, but they canceled their planned panel. In July 2008, Funimation Entertainment (then owned by its parent Navarre Corporation, now owned by Sony Pictures Television under the Crunchyroll brand) announced the acquisition of thirty of these titles.

On October 20, 2008, it was announced that ADV had entered into a licensing arrangement with new licensor Sentai Filmworks. The highlight of the new partnership was that ADV would be distributing the anime television adaptation of the popular visual novel &quot;Clannad&quot;, also they acquired the distribution rights to &quot;Koharu Biyori&quot;, &quot;Mahoromatic&quot;, &quot;Mahoromatic: Something More Beautiful&quot; (both were previously licensed by Geneon), &quot;Tsukihime&quot; (previously licensed by Geneon), &quot;Pet Shop of Horrors&quot; (previously licensed by Urban Vision), and &quot;Jewel BEM Hunter Lime&quot; (previously licensed by Media Blasters).

Following the May 2009 bankruptcy and liquidation of Central Park Media, ADV Films acquired the North American rights of &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; and re-released it on DVD on July 7, 2009. ADV Films also acquired the licenses of multiple other Central Park Media titles as well.

===Collapse===
On September 1, 2009, ADV announced that it was liquidating its assets, including intellectual properties, its distribution arm and the Anime Network, and going out of business. These assets would be transferred to four companies: Seraphim Studios, AEsir Holdings LLC, Valkyrie Media Partners LLC and SXION 23 LLC. The impact of this sale on the company&#x27;s plans to license and release new titles, is still not fully known, but the ADV brand name and logo have been retired. Anime News Network has reported that Seraphim Studios, Valkyrie Media Partners and SXION 23 are all corporations registered (initially filed) by Griffin D. Vance IV, who was ADV&#x27;s senior vice president of business and legal affairs.

The following companies all acquired assets from A.D. Vision:
* Sentai Filmworks is the licensor company for acquiring Japanese anime into the North American market.
* AEsir Holdings has licensed rights to most of ADV Films&#x27; former library of titles (some titles are licensed directly by Sentai Filmworks).
* Seraphim Studios acquired Amusement Park Media, ADV&#x27;s production studio, and it was renamed Seraphim Digital Studios.
* Valkyrie Media Partners acquired the Anime Network. The network continues to operate as before the sale.
* Section23 Films is a distributor and marketing company of Switchblade Pictures, Sentai Filmworks, Maiden Japan, and AEsir Holdings.

That day, major retail website &quot;Robert&#x27;s Corner Anime Blog&quot; contacted Mike Bailiff, formerly of ADV Films and now heading up Sales and Marketing at Section 23 Films. Bailiff revealed that &quot;Section 23 has acquired all of ADV&#x27;s former licenses and most of the staff&quot; including &quot;everyone at ADV that mattered.&quot;

On September 18, 2009, the anime review site iSugoi.com posted a full podcast devoted to the shutdown of ADV, analyzing that ADV had not shut down and the new companies such as Section 23 were ADV selling itself to itself: that it was not a shutdown but a drastic rebranding and restructuring. The report went on to say that Section 23 was, for all intents and purposes, the direct successor-organization to the old ADV company name, and that ADV split its assets such as the Anime Network into the other three companies to take advantage of several legal loopholes. The podcast report concluded with the assertion that Section 23, and the umbrella of associated companies ADV split into, could effectively be thought of as Neo-ADV (referencing how in Mobile Suit Gundam, when the Principality of Zeon was defeated, its remnants reorganized into Neo Zeon).

On October 15, 2009, rival distribution company Funimation posted an online Q&amp;A video panel hosted by events manager Adam Sheehan. When asked about ADV going out of business, Sheehan&#x27;s response was the following:

Ken Hoinsky, Managing Founder of MX Media LLC, a translation and localization company contracting with most major anime distribution companies (Funimation, Viz Media, Bandai), appeared on the October 29, 2009, Anime News Network podcast: in it he said that his company also contracts with Section 23, but that he also collectively refers to the allied companies that ADV split into as Neo-ADV.

== Divisions ==
=== ADV Films ===
ADV Films was the home video publication arm of A.D. Vision based in Houston, Texas, specializing in publishing anime and tokusatsu videos, as well as other live-action material. In 1996, ADV Films opened its UK division, and diversified into the realm of live-action television series and Japanese films.

The first title to be licensed and released to video was &quot;Devil Hunter Yohko&quot;. After that, they began acquiring an extensive library of titles. Initially, titles were released to video with the original Japanese language track and English subtitles added. A few years later, they began dubbing releases to English using a production and recording facility in Houston. They eventually started offering their recording services to other companies, so this studio was named Amusement Park Media. This studio was sold to Seraphim Digital after their bankruptcy.

ADV Films offered a program called Anime ADVocates, which provided free screening material and other promotional content to nearly 3,000 anime clubs in North America. To qualify for the program, the club had to be sponsored by a local high school, college, university, or public library and have at least 10 members. Member clubs were also asked to participate in surveys about the content they received. However, in November 2007, ADV Films put the program on hiatus, then on January 18, 2008, ADV Films announced that the program was being suspended indefinitely due to amount of resources the program needed. The company continued to offer anime clubs screening permission for its titles prior to its reorganization.

In July 2008, ADV Films and ARM Corporation transferred the licenses to over 30 different shows into the hands of fellow anime distributor Funimation. Those rights included the home video, broadcast, digital, and merchandising rights in North America and other regions.

Since then, former ADV titles have since been re-licensed by other companies such as Funimation, Sentai Filmworks, Discotek Media, Universal, Paramount and Nozomi Entertainment. Today, the ADV Films brand name is owned by Sentai Filmworks, who has released several titles under its name, such as &quot;Mezzo DSA&quot; on DVD, &quot;Kino&#x27;s Journey&quot; on DVD, and standard-definition Blu-ray, &quot;Elfen Lied&quot; on DVD and Blu-ray, and &quot;Lady Death: The Motion Picture&quot; on Blu-ray.

=== Anime Network ===

Anime Network was a cable channel in North America dedicated to anime. The network launched in North America in late 2002 and was marketed to multi-system operators (MSOs) as both a stand-alone 24-hour linear network and as a video on demand (VOD) programming service. The Anime Network was the United States&#x27; first all-anime cable TV network. On January 4, 2008, Anime Network officially announced that the traditional 24/7 service would cease operations.

Anime Network now exists as a VOD channel operating on many cable and satellite operators such as DirecTV, Dish Network, Cox, Time Warner, Cablevision, and Charter. It also has a Roku app. However the online service was decommissioned in 2017 following the launch of HIDIVE.

=== ADV Manga ===
ADV Manga was ADV&#x27;s division for the licensing and distribution of English translations of Japanese manga. The division was launched in 2003, with a strong list of titles and an ambitious plan for growth within the United States manga market. However, ADV Manga canceled many of their titles in late 2004 and 2005. In 2006, ADV Manga released the 6-volume &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days&quot; series and in 2007 the company resumed releasing several popular titles that had been on hiatus, including &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; and &quot;Gunslinger Girl&quot;.

At Anime Expo 2006, manga publisher Tokyopop announced that it had obtained the licenses for three titles formerly licensed by ADV that had been cancelled: &quot;Aria&quot;, &quot;Tactics&quot;, and &quot;Peacemaker Kurogane&quot;. Meanwhile, Yen Press has acquired the rights to &quot;Yotsuba&amp;!&quot; and &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;.

=== ADV Music ===
ADV Music was the music publishing division that focused on distributing anime and movie soundtracks. It was launched in 2003 after ending their partnership in AnimeTrax with The Right Stuf International. One initial release was the soundtrack for &quot;Onimusha 2: Samurai&#x27;s Destiny&quot;.

=== ADV Pro ===
ADV Pro was the company&#x27;s anime production studio. They worked on such in house productions as &quot;Lady Death: The Motion Picture&quot; and &quot;Mutineers&#x27; Moon&quot;. John Ledford stated in 2007 that ADV Pro had been &quot;reactivated&quot; and was working on &quot;Mutineers&#x27; Moon&quot;.

=== ADV Kids ===
ADV Kids was their label for works intended at younger audiences, with releases such as &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; OVA, The 1995 &quot;Street Fighter&quot; animated series and &quot;Mega Man: Upon a Star&quot;, as well as the 1994 &quot;Mega Man&quot; animated series, one of few Western animation releases from the company. However, the label failed to take off.

=== SoftCel Pictures ===

SoftCel Pictures was the branch of the company that specialized in the release of hentai anime titles on VHS and DVD. The first product released was &quot;Legend of Lyon Flare&quot;. This division was shut down in 2005 after spinning off from ADV, and most of its titles were acquired by Critical Mass, the hentai division of The Right Stuf International. In 2017, the SoftCel label was relaunched by Section23 Films, one of ADV&#x27;s successor companies.

=== Happy Carrot ===
ADV started the Happy Carrot branch in 2008 to release hentai anime titles on DVD, replacing SoftCel.

== Magazines ==
=== &quot;Newtype USA&quot; ===

&quot;Newtype USA&quot; was the US edition of Japan&#x27;s &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine. The first issue was published in November 2002. A.D. Vision (ADV) contacted its advertising partners to let them know that the February 2008 issue of &quot;Newtype USA&quot; was the last issue of the magazine. The magazine contained material it translated from the Japanese release as well as articles from American writers. It was expected to have 50,000 copies in for its initial circulation.

=== &quot;PiQ&quot; ===

&quot;PiQ&quot; premiered in May 2008 as a replacement for &quot;Newtype USA&quot;. It was published by PiQ LLC, a now-defunct subsidiary. The magazine had a broader focus and expanded coverage of topics beyond anime and manga. &quot;PiQ&quot; retained much of the editorial staff and freelance writers that once worked on its predecessor, as well as its 15,000 subscribers. In June 2008, after only four issues had been published, &quot;PiQ&quot; was canceled and its offices abruptly closed down. The July 2008 dated issue, which had already been released when the announcement was made, was the magazine&#x27;s last issue.

== Lawsuits ==
=== ARM Corporation ===
In 2008, A.D. Vision sued ARM Corporation and its parent Sojitz for a breach in a contract made previously. In the suit, the exact amount A.D. Vision paid to license twenty-nine titles was disclosed. The lawsuit was withdrawn and no ruling was made.

=== Gainax ===

In August 2011, A.D. Vision sued Gainax over their refusal to accept an option payment for the perpetual live-action rights to &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, including the planned live-action film; ADV charges that by refusing to accept payment, Gainax broke the contract and is asking for the rights and legal fees.

=== Funimation ===

In 2012, Funimation sued A.D. Vision, Sentai Filmworks, John Ledford, and several other associated organizations and individuals for , accusing them of breaching a contract. They wanted to get their transfer of assets done three years earlier declared void. The suit was settled out of court. The exact terms were not disclosed.

<text>Anime Network was an American video on demand (VOD) network dedicated to anime owned by AMC Networks.

==History ==

The network was launched in North America in late 2002 and is marketed to multi system operators (MSOs) as both a free and subscription video on demand (VOD) programming service. Anime Network also provides online streaming of its anime for North America via its website with free full-length preview episodes for non-members, more episodes for members, and all online titles available for subscribers.

In October 2007, Anime Network was launched on DirecTV On Demand, initially on channel 1801 at launch. As of the fall of 2015, it can now be found on channel 1889.

The Anime Network ceased broadcast of its linear 24/7 network on January 1, 2008; it continues to support a VOD service and online player on its main website. On September 1, 2009, A.D. Vision had sold off the Anime Network to Valkyrie Media Partners LLC as part of the dissolution of the company and the reorganization of its assets.

In June 2017, Section23 Films announced it would discontinue the Anime Network Online streaming service and focus solely on Anime Network&#x27;s pay television and subscription VOD services. HIDIVE, LLC, a new company which is not affiliated with Anime Network, Section23, or Sentai Filmworks, acquired Anime Network Online&#x27;s assets and spun them off into a new streaming service called HIDIVE. On June 20, 2017, Anime Network Inc. announced it acquired the &quot;www.theanimenetwork.com&quot; domain name from Anime Network Online.

==Availability and distribution==
At launch, the Anime Network was only available by video on demand to Comcast subscribers in the Philadelphia area with 1.2 million customers with more providers choosing to carry the service later on. The linear service launched on June 30, 2004, to complement the VOD service. Comcast Communications previously carried the channel on video on demand since its launch. On May 29, 2009, Comcast discontinued carriage of the service in both its free package and its pay-per-view digital television package which, however, are periodically included among Comcast Xfinity&#x27;s Top Picks.

===24/7 linear service===
From June 30, 2004, to January 4, 2008, Anime Network offered a 24/7 channel available to pay television providers. The service was only carried by small cable companies. On January 4, 2008, Anime Network officially announced that the 24/7 service would cease operations. The network will still operate as a VOD provider.

===Video on demand===
The Anime Network&#x27;s content was distributed through video on demand in two formats.

Sony announced at E3 2010 that the PlayStation Network would begin carrying The Anime Network.

==Anime Network (UK)==


On June 3, 2007, Anime Network was launched in the United Kingdom as a programming block on the Propeller TV satellite channel, produced by A.D. Vision. It was broadcast as a 2-hour block with 4 different anime series and aired from 8:00pm to 10:00pm, 7 days a week. The block was removed from the schedule on January 1, 2008, which was the same day Anime Network discontinued its North American 24/7 linear service to continue to support its VOD service.

<doc id="287752" wikidata="Q8193873" url="?curid=287752" title="Mattock">
<text>A mattock () is a hand tool used for digging, prying, and chopping. Similar to the pickaxe, it has a long handle and a stout head which combines either a vertical axe blade with a horizontal adze (cutter mattock), or a pick and an adze (pick mattock). A cutter mattock is similar to a Pulaski used in fighting fires. It is also commonly known in North America as a &quot;grub axe&quot;.

==Description==
A mattock has a shaft, typically made of wood, which is long. The head consists of two ends, opposite each other and separated by a central eye. A mattock head typically weighs . The form of the head determines the kind and uses of the mattock:

* A &quot;cutter mattock&quot; combines the functions of an axe and adze, with its axe blade oriented vertically and longer adze horizontally.
* A &quot;pick mattock&quot; combines the function of a pick and adze, with a pointed end opposite an adze blade.

Both are used for grubbing in hard soils and rocky terrain, with the pick mattock having the advantage of a superior penetrating tool over the cutter mattock, which excels at cutting roots.

==Uses==
Mattocks are &quot;the most versatile of hand-planting tools&quot;. They can be used to chop into the ground with the adze and pull the soil towards the user, opening a slit to plant into. They can also be used to dig holes for planting into, and are particularly useful where there is a thick layer of matted sod. The use of a mattock can be tiring because of the effort needed to drive the blade into the ground, and the amount of bending and stooping involved.

The adze of a mattock is useful for digging or hoeing, especially in hard soil.

Cutter mattocks () are used in rural Africa for removing stumps from fields, including unwanted banana suckers.

==History==

As a simple but effective tool, mattocks have a long history. Their shape was already established by the Bronze Age in Asia Minor and ancient Greece. According to Sumerian mythology, the mattock was invented by the god Enlil. Mattocks () are the most commonly depicted tool in Byzantine manuscripts of Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot;.

Mattocks made from antlers first appear in the British Isles in the Late Mesolithic. They were probably used chiefly for digging, and may have been related to the rise of agriculture. Mattocks made of whalebone were used for tasks including flensing – stripping blubber from the carcass of a whale – by the broch people of Scotland and by the Inuit.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;mattock&quot; is of unclear origin; one theory traces it from Proto-Germanic, from Proto-Indo-European. There are no clear cognates in other Germanic languages, and similar words in various Celtic languages are borrowings from the English (e.g. , , ). However, there are proposed cognates in Old High German and Middle High German, and more speculatively with words in Balto-Slavic languages, including Old Church Slavonic &#x27; and Lithuanian &#x27;, and even Sanskrit. It may be cognate to or derived from the unattested Vulgar Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning club or cudgel. The &quot;New English Dictionary&quot; of 1906 interpreted &quot;mattock&quot; as a diminutive, but there is no root to derive it from, and no semantic reason for the diminutive formation. Forms such as &quot;mathooke&quot;, &quot;motthook&quot; and &quot;mathook&quot; were produced by folk etymology. Although used to prepare whale blubber, which the Inuit call &quot;mattaq&quot;, no such connection is known. 

While the noun &quot;mattock&quot; is attested from Old English onwards, the transitive verb &quot;to mattock&quot; or &quot;to mattock up&quot; first appeared in the mid-17th century.

<text>Leonard Charles Huia Lye (; 5 July 1901 – 15 May 1980) was a New Zealand artist known primarily for his experimental films and kinetic sculpture. His films are held in archives including the New Zealand Film Archive, British Film Institute, Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and the Pacific Film Archive at University of California, Berkeley. Lye&#x27;s sculptures are found in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery and the Berkeley Art Museum. Although he became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1950, much of his work went to New Zealand after his death, where it is housed at the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery in New Plymouth.

==Career==
As a student, Lye became convinced that motion could be part of the language of art, leading him to early (and now lost) experiments with kinetic sculpture, as well as a desire to make film. Lye was also one of the first Pākehā artists to appreciate the art of Māori, Australian Aboriginal, Pacific Island and African cultures, and this had great influence on his work. In the early 1920s Lye travelled widely in the South Pacific. He spent extended periods in Australia and Samoa, where he was expelled by the New Zealand colonial administration for living within an indigenous community.
Working his way as a coal trimmer aboard a steam ship, Lye moved to London in 1926. He quickly entered modernist circles, exhibiting with the Seven and Five Society from 1927 until 1934, and becoming affiliated with the Footprints Studio. Most notably, Lye exhibited in the 1936 International Surrealist Exhibition and began to make experimental films. Following his first animated film &quot;Tusalava&quot;, Lye began to make films in association with the British General Post Office, for the GPO Film Unit. He reinvented the technique of drawing directly on film, producing his animation for the 1935 film &quot;A Colour Box&quot;, an advertisement for &quot;cheaper parcel post&quot;, without using a camera for anything except the title cards at the beginning of the film. It was the first direct film screened to a general audience. It was made by painting vibrant abstract patterns on the film itself, synchronizing them to a popular dance tune by Don Baretto and His Cuban Orchestra. A panel of animation experts convened in 2005 by the Annecy Film Festival put this film among the top ten most significant works in the history of animation (his later film &quot;Free Radicals&quot;, not completed until 1979, was also in the top 50).

Lye also worked for the GPO Film Unit&#x27;s successor, the Crown Film Unit producing wartime information films, such as &quot;Musical Poster Number One&quot;. On the basis of this work, Lye was later offered work for &quot;The March of Time&quot; newsreel in New York. Leaving his wife and children in England, Lye moved to New York in 1944.

In &quot;Free Radicals&quot; he used black film stock and scratched designs into the emulsion. The result was a dancing pattern of flashing lines and marks, as dramatic as lightning in the night sky. In 2008, this film was added to the United States National Film Registry.

Lye continued to experiment with the possibilities of direct film-making to the end of his life. In various films he used a range of dyes, stencils, air-brushes, felt tip pens, stamps, combs and surgical instruments, to create images and textures on celluloid. In &quot;Color Cry&quot;, he employed the &quot;photogram&quot; method combined with various stencils and fabrics to create abstract patterns. It is a 16mm direct film featuring a searing soundtrack by the blues singer Sonny Terry.

As a writer, Len Lye produced a body of work exploring his theory of &quot;IHN&quot; (Individual Happiness Now). He also wrote a large number of letters and poems. He was a friend of Dylan Thomas, and of Laura Riding and Robert Graves (their Seizin Press published &quot;No Trouble&quot;, a book drawn from Lye&#x27;s letters to them, his mother, and others, in 1930). The NZEPC (New Zealand Electronic Poetry Centre) website contains a selection of Lye&#x27;s writings, which are just as surprising and experimental as his work in other media. One of his theories was that artists attempt to reproduce themselves in their works, which he exposited in an essay complete with visual examples.

Lye was also an important kinetic sculptor and what he referred to as &quot;Tangibles&quot;. He saw film and kinetic sculpture as aspects of the same &quot;art of motion&quot;, which he theorised in a highly original way in his essays (collected in the book &quot;Figures of Motion&quot;).

Many of his kinetic works can be found at the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery in New Plymouth, Taranaki including a 45-metre high &quot;Wind Wand&quot; near the sea. The &quot;Water Whirler&quot;, designed by Lye but never realised in his lifetime, was installed on Wellington&#x27;s waterfront in 2006. His &quot;Tangibles&quot; were shown at MOMA in New York in 1961 and are now found worldwide. In 1977, Len Lye returned to his homeland to oversee the first New Zealand exhibition of his work at the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery at that time under the directorship of Ron O&#x27;Reilly. Shortly before his death in 1980, Lye and his supporters established the Len Lye Foundation, to which he gave his work. The gallery is the repository for much of this collection, employing a full-time curator to ensure its preservation and appropriate exhibition.

Lye was a maverick, never fitting any of the usual art historical labels. Although he did not become a household name, his work was familiar to many film-makers and kinetic sculptors – he was something of an &quot;artist&#x27;s artist&quot;, and his innovations have had an international influence. He is also remembered for his colourful personality, amazing clothes, and highly unorthodox lecturing style (he taught at New York University for three years).

The 21st century has seen renewed international interest in Lye&#x27;s career with retrospectives held at the Pompidou Centre, Paris in 2000, an Australian touring exhibition organised in 2001 by the Art Gallery of NSW, Sydney, at ACMI, Melbourne in 2009, and at Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, UK in 2010. Similarly, in New Zealand, surveys have been shown at the Gus Fisher Gallery, Auckland in 2009, and City Gallery Wellington in 2013. The University of Auckland staged an opera &quot;Len Lye the opera&quot;, composed by Eve de Castro-Robinson, about his life in 2012.

==Personal life==
Lye was married twice.
His first wife was Jane (Florence Winifred) Thompson with whom he had two children:
* Bix Lye, also a sculptor, who lived and worked in Williamsburg, New York and Newburgh New York. Died January 2023.
* Yancy Ning Lou Lye (born 20 May 1940, Chiswick, London)

In Reno, Nevada, in May 1948, Lye married his second wife, Annette &quot;Ann&quot; Zeiss (born 1910, Minnesota) on the same day he obtained a divorce from Jane. Ann was formerly married to Tommy Hindle, a British journalist.

He died in Warwick, New York, in 1980.

==Legacy==
In 1971 artist Ray Thorburn met with Len Lye and on his return to New Zealand attempted to arrange an exhibition at the National Art Gallery but was rejected. The director of the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery Bob Ballard and local engineer John Matthews were more receptive resulting in Thorburn and Matthews going to New York to discuss an exhibition and the construction of a large work &quot;Trilogy&quot; with Lye. In 1977 Hamish Keith, Matthews and Thorburn set in motion the formation of a non-profit foundation and in 1980 a Trust Deed resulted in the Len Lye gift to the gallery. The Len Lye Collection and Archive consists of all non-film works in Lye’s possession at the time of his death in 1980, as well as several items that have been given to or otherwise acquired by the Foundation since. This body of work is extended by Len Lye works in the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery. Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision (formerly the New Zealand Film Archive) is the repository of Lye’s film prints that are owned by the Len Lye Foundation, and viewing prints are also in the Collection at the Govett-Brewster. The Len Lye Centre a dedicated gallery for the Len Lye collection connected to the Govett-Brewster was opened on 25 July 2015. This is the first gallery in New Zealand to be dedicated to a single artist.

There are two documentaries about Lye: &quot;Flip and Two Twisters&quot;, directed by Shirley Horrocks and &quot;Doodlin&quot;&#x27;, and a DVD of Lye&#x27;s talks illustrated with slides: &quot;Len Lye Talks about Art&quot;.

<text>Videodisc (or video disc) is a general term for a laser- or stylus-readable random-access disc that contains both audio and analog video signals recorded in an analog form. Typically, it is a reference to any such media that predates the mainstream popularity of the DVD format. The first mainstream official Videodisc was the Television Electronic Disc (TED) Videodisc, and the newest is the 4K Ultra HD Blu-Ray Disc. As of September 2023, the active video disc formats are Blu-ray Disc, DVD, and in other regions because of the price difference from DVD, Video CD (VCD) and SVCD.

==History==
Georges Demeny on March 3, 1892 patented a &#x27;phonoscope&#x27;, designed in 1891, that can project chronophotographic pictures on a glass disc.

Eadweard Muybridge used his zoopraxiscope to project chronophotographic pictures on a glass disc in 1893.

E &amp; H T Anthony, a camera maker based in New York, marketed in 1898 a combination motion picture camera and projector called &quot;The Spiral&quot; that could capture 200 images arranged in a spiral on an 8-inch diameter glass plate. When played back at 16 frames per second, it would give a running time of 13 seconds.

Theodore Brown patented in 1907 (UK patent GB190714493) a photographic disk system of recording approximately 1,200 images in a spiral of pictures on a 10-inch disk. Played back at 16 frames per second, a disk provides around one and a quarter minutes of material. The system was marketed as the Urban Spirograph by Charles Urban, and discs were produced - but it soon disappeared.

John Logie Baird, created the Phonovision system in the early 1930s, which mechanically produces about four frames per second. The system was not successful.

P.M.G. Toulon, a French inventor working at Westinghouse Electric during the 1950s and 1960s patented a system in 1952 (US Patent 3198880) which uses a slow spinning disc with a spiral track of photographically 1.5 millimeter wide recorded frames, along with a flying spot scanner, which sweeps over them to produce a video image. This was intended to be synchronously combined with playback from a vinyl record. It appears a working system was never produced. It has similarities with the tape based Electronic Video Recording system, which was released for professional use.

Westinghouse Electric Corporation developed a system in 1965 called Phonovid, that allows for the playback of 400 stored still images, along with 40 minutes of sound. The system uses a standard record player, and builds the picture up slowly.

The Television Electronic Disc, a mechanical system, was rolled out in Germany and Austria in 1970 by Telefunken. The 12-inch discs have a capacity of about eight minutes; however, it was abandoned in favor of VHS by its parent company.

In Japan, the TOSBAC computer was using digital video disks to display color pictures at 256x256 image resolution in 1972. In 1973, Hitachi announced a video disc capable of recording 15-colour still images on a disc. The same year, Sony announced a video disc recorder, similar to the Sony Mavica format.

In 1975, Hitachi introduced a video disc system in which chrominance, luminance and sound information are encoded holographically. Each frame is recorded as a 1mm diameter hologram on a 305mm disc, while a laser beam reads out the hologram from three angles. It has a capacity of 54,000 frames, with a running time of 30 minutes for the NTSC color standard or 36 minutes for PAL/SECAM.

Visc is a mechanical video disc system developed in Japan by Matsushita subsidiary National Panasonic in 1978. The 12-inch vinyl disc is spun at 500 rpm with each revolution holding three frames of color video, with a total of up to an hour of video on each side of the disc. Discs can be recorded in either a 30-minute-per-side format, or a 60-minute-per-side-format. A later incarnation of the system uses 9-inch discs in caddies capable of storing 75 minutes per side. The system was abandoned in January 1980 in favor of JVC&#x27;s VHD system.

The DiscoVision system was released in America in 1978. Developed by MCA and Philips of the Netherlands, it utilizes an optical reflective system read by a laser beam. It was renamed several times, as &quot;VLP&quot;, &quot;Laservision&quot;, and &quot;CD Video&quot;. Finally, Japan&#x27;s Pioneer Electronic Corporation trademarked it as LaserDisc, the name by which it is perhaps best known. The format struggled to gain wide acceptance in the consumer market, and Pioneer became the chief sponsor of the format when MCA, and later Philips, withdrew their support for it. The high cost of both players and discs was the main reason for its ultimate demise.

Thomson CSF created a system that uses thin flexible video discs and a transmissive laser system, with light source and pickup on opposite sides of the disc. The system was marketed for industrial and educational use in 1980. Each side of the disc can hold 50,000 still CAV frames, and both sides can be read without removing the disc. Thomson exited the videodisc market in 1981.

RCA produced a system called CED under the brand SelectaVision in 1981. The system uses a physical pickup riding in grooves of a pressed disc, reading variance in capacitance in the underlying disc. The system competed with Laserdisc for a few years, before being abandoned in 1984. Although, movie studios continued releasing titles in the format until 1986.

JVC produced a system very similar to CED called Video High Density (VHD). It was launched in 1983 and marketed predominantly in Japan. It is a capacitance contact system but without grooves. VHD discs were adopted in the UK by Thorn EMI which started to develop a consumer catalogue, including bespoke material. Development for the mass market was halted in late 1983, but the system remained on sale for educational and business markets as a computer-controlled video system until the late 1980s.

Laserfilm, a videodisc format developed by McDonnell Douglas was released in 1984.

MovieCD, by SIRIUS Publishing, Inc. (1995?), is a format that uses a traditional CD-ROM disc for playback on a Windows PC containing a video file of a movie encoded in a proprietary codec developed by the publisher (the MotionPixels codec, also used in some PC video games in the mid-to-late 1990s), with the disc also containing codec and playback software for the movie. The quality is somewhat low due to the compression the MotionPixels codec used, resulting in a playback resolution of only 320x236 at 16 frames per second, using 16-bit high color.

DVD (Digital Video Disc, or Digital Versatile Disc) was released in 1996. It is a hybrid of Philips and Sony&#x27;s MM-CD (Multi-Media Compact Disc) format and Toshiba&#x27;s SD (Super Density) format. The last-minute adoption of the hybrid DVD format was agreed to by all three companies in an effort to avoid a damaging format war, similar to that between Beta and VHS in the 1970s and 1980s. Toshiba failed to reach a similar compromise agreement with Sony in the race to develop a high-definition optical video disc format in the 2000s. This proved to be a costly mistake for Toshiba (and the format&#x27;s co-developers, NEC and Microsoft), and the AOD (Advanced Optical Disc) format, later renamed HD DVD, lost a brutal format war with Sony&#x27;s Blu-ray Disc (BD) format. This format war delayed acceptance of either format, and Blu-ray Disc has only recently gained traction in the consumer market, where it competes with the continued success of DVD and the rise of streaming movie services such as Netflix.

<text>Aloha Airlines was an airline in the United States that operated passenger flights from 1946 until 2008. It was headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii, operating from its hub at Honolulu International Airport (now Daniel K. Inouye International Airport).

==History==
===Propeller era===
The airline was founded as charter carrier Trans-Pacific Airlines by publisher Ruddy F. Tongg Sr. as a competitor to Hawaiian Airlines, commencing operations on July 26, 1946, with a war-surplus Douglas C-47 (DC-3) on a flight from Honolulu to Maui and Hilo. Tongg and partners founded the airline after being bumped from flights on the only inter-island carrier, Hawaiian Airlines. The company employed local Island residents and its first slogan was &quot;The People&#x27;s Airline. It soon earned the nickname &quot;The Aloha Airline&quot;. Approval to operate as a scheduled airline came when President Harry S. Truman signed the certificate on February 21, 1949, with the first scheduled flight on June 6, 1949, following ceremonies held the previous day.

In 1952, the airline reported its first annual profit, approximately $36,000. In 1950, the airline adopted the name TPA-The Aloha Airline. To compete, Hawaiian Airlines began using the Convair 340. In 1958, real estate developer Hung Wo Ching, became CEO of the airline and changed the name to Aloha Airlines. In 1959, Aloha began using Fairchild F-27 turboprops. Also in 1959, the company became a public company via an initial public offering.

===Jet engine era===

Aloha retired its last DC-3 on January 3, 1961, becoming the second airline in the United States to operate an all-turbine fleet. In 1963, the airline took delivery of two Vickers Viscounts from Austrian Airlines and soon acquired a third from Northeast Airlines. The October 1, 1964, cover of the airline&#x27;s system timetable proclaimed &quot;&quot;Hawaii&#x27;s Only All Jet Power&quot; &quot;Service&quot; &quot;Between The Islands&quot;&quot; as Aloha was operating all of its inter-island flights at this time with the Fairchild F-27 and Vickers Viscount turboprops. Soon, the airline made the move to pure jets, with its first new British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven twin jet arriving in Honolulu on April 16, 1966. The last F-27 was retired from service in June 1967. As Hawaiian Airlines took delivery of larger Douglas DC-9-30 jets, Aloha realized its smaller BAC One-Eleven series 200 aircraft, which also suffered from performance penalties at Kona International Airport (which had a shorter runway at the time), put it at a disadvantage. Aloha placed an order for two Boeing 737-200 jetliners in 1968. Named &quot;Funbirds,&quot; the Boeing jets entered service in March 1969. The massive capacity increase hurt both airlines, and in 1970, the first of three unsuccessful merger attempts between the two rivals (the others coming in 1988 and 2001) was made. In October 1971, the airline sold its remaining Viscount 745 turboprop aircraft and became an all-jet airline.

In 1983, Aloha introduced its AlohaPass frequent flyer program. In 1984, the airline leased a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, and on May 28, inaugurated service with the aircraft between Honolulu, Guam, and Taipei under the name Aloha Pacific. The operation, however, was unable to compete with Continental Airlines, and was discontinued on January 12, 1985. In October 1985, Aloha acquired Quick-Change 737 aircraft that could be quickly converted from a passenger configuration to all-cargo freighter for nighttime cargo flights. In February 1986, Aloha began weekly flights between Honolulu and Kiritimati (Christmas Island), becoming the first airline to operate ETOPS approved Boeing 737-200s.

In late 1986, Ching and vice-chairman Sheridan Ing announced plans to take the company private after surviving hostile takeover bids, and it remained in the hands of the Ing and Ching families until its emergence from bankruptcy in 2006, when additional investors including Yucaipa Companies, Aloha Aviation Investment Group, and Aloha Hawaii Investors LLC took stakes in the airline. In 1987, the airline acquired Princeville Airways, renaming Aloha IslandAir, which became known as Island Air in 1995. In 2003, Island Air was sold to Gavarnie Holding and became an independent airline.

On February 14, 2000, the airline began mainland service, flying newly delivered ETOPS certified Boeing 737-700 jetliners from Honolulu, Kahului, and Kona, Hawaii, to Oakland. The carrier soon started regularly scheduled flights to and from Orange County, San Diego, Sacramento, Reno, and Las Vegas. Aloha also offered flights from Honolulu to Vancouver. In addition, the airline served the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport (BUR, now known as Bob Hope Airport) in the Los Angeles area with nonstop Boeing 737-700 service to and from Honolulu.

Aloha Airline&#x27;s longest inter-island route was , while the shortest route was a mere . The average travel distance per inter-island flight was . From late-1989 through mid-2006, Aloha marketed some inter-island routes served by partner Island Air, and passengers earned miles in either its own frequent flyer program, AlohaPass, or in United Airlines&#x27; Mileage Plus program.

===Economic challenges===
Rising costs and economic stagnation in Japan put Aloha into a defensive position in the early 2000s, exacerbated by the September 11 attacks, the SARS panic of 2003, and soaring fuel prices. On December 30, 2004, Aloha Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Led by Marc Bilbao and six other Giuliani advisors in December 2004, Giuliani Partners through Giuliani Capital sold Aloha to Ronald Burkle&#x27;s group of investors and also obtained a $65 million loan for the carrier. In November 2005, Giuliani renegotiated with Aloha Chief David Banmiller for Giuliani&#x27;s total compensation to be increased to $2.9 million. Following approval of new labor contracts and securing additional investment from new investors, the airline emerged from bankruptcy protection on February 17, 2006. On August 30, 2006, Gordon Bethune was named chairman.

Citing losses from a protracted fare war incited by inter-island competitor go! (operated by parent company Mesa Airlines) and high fuel prices, Aloha filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection again on March 20, 2008. Ten days later, on March 30, 2008, Aloha Airlines announced the suspension of all scheduled passenger flights, with the final day of operation to be March 31, 2008. The shutdown resulted in the layoffs of about 1,900 of the company&#x27;s roughly 3,500 employees. Governor of Hawaii Linda Lingle asked the bankruptcy court involved to delay the shutdown of Aloha Airlines passenger services, and forcibly restore passenger service; however, federal Bankruptcy Judge Lloyd King declined, saying the court should not interfere with business decisions.

After the shutdown of passenger operations, Aloha and its creditors represented by Fieldstone Aviation LLC sought to auction its profitable cargo and contract services division. Fieldstone arranged for Pacific Air Cargo to acquire the contract services ground handling division in 2008 for $2.2 million and it now operates it under the name Aloha Contract Services.

Fieldstone Aviation LLC represented Aloha in the sale of the Aloha cargo division and solicited interest from potential buyers. Several companies expressed interest in purchasing Aloha&#x27;s cargo division, including Seattle-based Saltchuk Resources, California-based Castle &amp; Cooke Aviation, and Hawaii-based Kahala Capital (which included Richard Ing, a minority investor in the Aloha Air Group and member of Aloha&#x27;s board of directors). However, a disagreement between cargo division bidders and Aloha&#x27;s primary lender, GMAC Commercial Finance, ended with the bidders dropping out of the auction. Almost immediately afterwards, GMAC halted all funding to Aloha&#x27;s cargo division, forcing all cargo operations to cease; at the same time, Aloha&#x27;s board of directors decided to convert its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization filing into a Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation.

Saltchuk decided to renew its bid to purchase the cargo division at the urging of U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye, and a deal between Aloha and Saltchuk was struck and approved by the federal bankruptcy court, where Saltchuk would purchase the cargo division for $10.5 million. The sale arranged by Fieldstone Aviation LLC was approved by federal Bankruptcy Judge Lloyd King on May 12, 2008, with the sale expected to close two days later.

Prior to its bid for Aloha, Saltchuk Resources was already present in Hawaii through its subsidiaries Young Brothers/Hawaiian Tug &amp; Barge, Hawaii Fuel Network, Maui Petroleum and Minit Stop Stores. The company also owns Northern Air Cargo, Alaska&#x27;s largest cargo airline. A new subsidiary, Aeko Kula Inc., was set up by Saltchuk to operate Aloha Air Cargo.

===Name and intellectual property===
In January 2011, Los Angeles-based Yucaipa Companies, the former majority shareholder of Aloha, won federal Bankruptcy Court approval to buy the Aloha name and other intellectual property for $1.5 million with a stipulation that it not resell the name to Mesa Air Group, the parent of go! Mokulele. In 2009, Mesa sought to re-brand its go! planes as Aloha. But federal Bankruptcy Judge Lloyd King stopped the name change, following impassioned pleas from former Aloha Airlines employees who largely blamed Mesa for Aloha&#x27;s demise.

At the time the Aloha airlines ceased operations, the airline&#x27;s fleet was an all-737 fleet:

===Fleet development===
As of March 2008, the average age of the Aloha Airlines fleet was 18.2 years.

===Previously operated aircraft types===

Other jet aircraft previously operated by Aloha included the Boeing 737-300 and 737-400. According to various Aloha Airlines flight schedules which appeared in the Official Airline Guide (OAG), these aircraft were used for a short period of time on inter-island flights in Hawaii. Two Boeing 737-100 aircraft were also used briefly during the mid seventies time frame.

The airline previously operated Douglas C-47 prop aircraft followed by Fairchild F-27 and Vickers Viscount turboprop airliners. The first jet type operated by Aloha was the British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven. Aloha subsidiary Aloha Pacific operated the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 wide body jetliner.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On June 27, 1969, Vickers Viscount (N7410) was damaged beyond repair when it collided on the ground with Douglas DC-9-31 N906H of Hawaiian Airlines at Honolulu International Airport.
*On August 8, 1971, Vickers Viscount (N7415) was damaged beyond economic repair at Honolulu International Airport when a fire broke out upon landing.
*On April 28, 1988, Aloha Airlines Flight 243, a scheduled Boeing 737-200 flight between Hilo and Honolulu, suffered extensive damage after an explosive decompression in flight, but was able to land safely at Kahului Airport on Maui. A senior flight attendant, Clarabelle Lansing, was the sole fatality when she was blown out of the airplane, and 64 passengers and one crew member were injured, eight of them seriously. The safe landing of the aircraft with such a major loss of integrity was unprecedented and remains unsurpassed. Subsequent investigations concluded that the accident was caused by metal fatigue. The 1990 made-for-television film &quot;Miracle Landing&quot; is based on this accident.

<text>Bernardus Accama (1697–1756) was an 18th-century Dutch historical and portrait painter.

He was born in Friesland, possibly in Burum, the son of Aeltje Boetes Nievelt and Simon Accama, the local church minister. He was christened on 12 July 1697 at Burum. He lived much of his life in Leeuwarden. He worked for and executed commissions for William IV, Prince of Orange. However, much of his work was lost during the Revolution of 1795. He was the brother and instructor of the painter Matthijs Accama.

<text>Koos is the largest of several small islands in the Bay of Greifswald, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. It has an area of 772 hectares and a maximum elevation of just above three meters. The island is a largely uninhabited natural reserve with restricted access. It is separated from the mainland by &quot;Kooser Bucht&quot; and &quot;Kooser See&quot;, two bays connected by a tiny strait, &quot;Beek&quot;.

In 1241, Barnuta, prince of Rügen, granted Koos (then &quot;&quot;Chosten&quot;) to Eldena abbey (then &quot;Hilda&quot;&quot;), later it became a possession of the Hanseatic town of Greifswald, located a few kilometers southward. A medieval burgh has been suggested on the isle, but not verified. A 17th-century Dutch settlement had disappeared in the 18th century. Koos is administered by the nearby town of Greifswald.

<text>Jurong () is a major geographical region located at the south-westernmost point of the West Region of Singapore. Although mostly vaguely defined, the region&#x27;s extent roughly covers the planning areas of Jurong East, Jurong West, Boon Lay, and Pioneer, along with Jurong Island in the Western Islands cluster and the southernmost portions of the Western Water Catchment. The Jurong region can also include present-day Bukit Batok and Tuas.

Jurong also covers several offshore islands as well, including Pulau Damar Laut and Pulau Samulun, both of which are located within the planning areas of Jurong East and Boon Lay respectively; along with the aforementioned Jurong Island. The coastline of the region on mainland Singapore, faces the strait of Selat Jurong, while the southernmost island of the region, Jurong Island, faces the strait of Selat Pandan.

Jurong was first developed and heavily industrialised in the late 1960s in response to the general economic situation of post-independence Singapore, and remains vital to the country&#x27;s economic growth, either commercial, industrial and residential. The heavy redevelopment of the region paved the way for the opening of a large-scale industrial sector in the country, something which was unprecedented at that time. Today, Jurong has become one of the most densely-populated industrial areas in the country. Since the turn of the century, Jurong is envisioned to be the country&#x27;s second central business district (CBD) as part of the Jurong Lake District project.

==Etymology==
&quot;Jurong&quot; took its name from Sungei Jurong, a river that still channels into Jurong Lake, the latter of which was created by damming the river itself.

Although its origins are disputed, the core definition of &quot;Jurong&quot;, is probably derived from several meanings in Malay. The term could probably refer to the word for shark, &quot;&quot;Jerung&quot;. It can also be derived from the word &quot;Jurang&quot; or a gorge. Jurong could also take its name from the word, &quot;Penjuru&quot;&quot;, which roughly translates to, corner. Penjuru may most likely refer to the peninsula that sits between Sungei Jurong and Sungei Pandan. The native Malays named this peninsula, Tanjong Penjuru, which can be translated as Cape Corner in English. The present-day site of Tanjong Penjuru is now the subzone of Penjuru Crescent.

==Geography==

===Pre-industrial Jurong===

====Landscape====

Although Jurong&#x27;s geography was documented on a few maps and records following Singapore&#x27;s founding in 1819, the area only became clearer to the British in an 1828 geographical survey of the island by Lieutenant Philip Jackson. In a map that was drawn after the survey, the lieutenant clearly describes most of Jurong&#x27;s natural geography with the two rivers of Jurong, Sungei Jurong and Sungei Pandan, marked on the map. He also noted down several islands which have since ceased to exist. Such islands include, Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Butun, Pulau Pese (Pulau Pesek), Pulau Sakra and Pulau Saraya (Pulau Seraya), all of which have since merged to form Jurong Island. Current geographical landmarks such as Pulau Damar Laut and the strait of Selat Sembilan (now Selat Jurong) have also been included on the map.

The two rivers of Jurong were mentioned again in 1848, when a second survey conducted by John Turnbull Thomson, described the original shape and settlements of Sungei Jurong and Sungei Pandan. Turnbull describes both rivers as, &quot;large creeks&quot; with settlements around them both.

However, in the case of Sungei Jurong, Thomson gives his description as such:

Before the damming of Sungei Jurong, the present-day site of Jurong Lake was once occupied by two streams that split at the junction of the river. These two streams have since ceased to exist. However, like what Thomson said, these bodies of water roughly marked the present day locations of Jurong East and West, at that time identified as Jurong and Peng Kang on colonial era maps respectively.

Before its development in the 1960s, Jurong was left close to its pristine state after Singapore&#x27;s founding in 1819. Although there were a few settlements around Jurong, most of the land was mainly uncharted territory. Swamps dominated the coastline of Jurong, yielding large amounts of wildlife such as mudskippers and horseshoe crabs. A forest reserve of dipterocarp trees would have once stood inland behind the grove of rhizophora trees along the coast. Low hills were mainly the highest elevated points around Jurong, although most of them were later levelled over the years.

This was evident, given the description made by Commodore Perry in his accounts of Jurong made during the Perry Expedition:

====Territorial extent====
In maps made by the British administration before Singapore&#x27;s self-governance in 1959, the colonial era district (mukim) of Jurong was rather small, occupying what is today the present-day town of Bukit Batok and Tengah. Jurong Mukim was earlier known as West Bukit Timak Mukim, the renaming to Juong Mukim is probably with reference the Jurong settlement located at the head of Jurong River and also located at the south-west corner of this Mukim. Other than that, most part of Jurong Mukim has very little historical basis for calling herself &#x27;Jurong&#x27;.

Furthermore, many residents have often regarded the areas along the stretch of Jurong Road, especially the southern areas, as part of the extant of Jurong. Such areas include the colonial era districts (mukims) of Peng Kang (now Jurong West and Boon Lay), the southern portions of Choa Chu Kang (now Jurong West extension and NTU), Pandan (now split into Jurong East to the west and Clementi to the east) and Tuas (now Pioneer and the newly reclaimed Tuas peninsula).

===Modern Jurong===

====Ecology====

Today, most of what is left of the original pristine Jurong is restricted to the areas around the Pandan Reservoir and Sungei Pandan. Little traces of the dipterocarp forest still remain. The mangrove swamps today are now just a fraction of its former self, located at the mouth of Sungei Pandan. The untouched mangrove fringes still hold the last remnants of wildlife in Jurong. It is because of this that area remains a hotspot for nature enthusiasts and bird watchers to this day.

====Water bodies====
Jurong is home to two prominent rivers, Sungei Jurong and Sungei Pandan, both of which flow into two larger water bodies, Jurong Lake and Pandan Reservoir respectively. The two rivers also source from Selat Jurong, a strait that faces south of mainland Singapore and north of Jurong Island.

The two rivers also have extensions that flow into the mainland portion of the region. Sungei Pandan has a western branch, Sungei Ulu Pandan, which flows from Jurong East into the town of Clementi before cutting off at Queenstown located east of Clementi. Sungei Jurong channels out of Jurong Lake via a stream located west of the lake and Jurong Canal located directly north of the lake. The canal also serves as the boundary line between the towns of Jurong East and West.

====Elevation points====
The highest elevation point in the region is Jurong Hill, which is located close to the centre of the industrial estate at Jurong (positioned north of Jurong Island) just adjacent to Jurong Bird Park.

====Geology====
Jurong&#x27;s unique locale lends to itself a special rock formation unlike any other in Singapore. Named the Jurong Formation, the sedimentary rock deposits can trace its roots back to the late Triassic and early to middle Jurassic periods.

====Territorial extent====
The name &quot;Jurong&quot; is often used to collectively describe the region&#x27;s five main planning areas. However, the URA does not officially recognise all of these places as a single territorial entity. Since the gazetting of the 1998 Master Plan, the Authority has officially classified Jurong as five individual separate planning areas. When Jurong is split into these five contiguous parts, it forms Jurong East and West in the north and north-west, Boon Lay and Pioneer to the south and south-west and Tuas to the extreme west of the region. Each of these individual areas can yet be further divided into subzones, smaller subdistricts that are a part of the larger planning area itself. If all five planning areas are combined, there would be a grand total of 34 subzones in Jurong.

The boundaries of modern-day Jurong were first demarcated in the 1960 proposal of the new town. The planned town was to be located entirely south of Jurong Road, combining land that was once the colonial era districts (mukims) of Peng Kang, Pandan and the southernmost portion of Choa Chu Kang. As a result of this proposal, the government gazetted portions of land from these areas to increase the overall size of Jurong. These boundaries were later further defined with the introduction of the URA 1991 Concept Plan in September 1991.

==History==

===Before Raffles (c. 1600 – 1819)===
The earliest known significance of Jurong can be traced back to 1595 on a maritime documentation of oriental trading routes. Titled &quot;Reys-gheschrift van de Navigation der Portugaloysers in Orienten&quot;, the journal written by Dutch author Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, names a certain &quot;Selat Sembilan&quot; that one must cross eastwards after reaching the southernmost end of the Strait of Malacca. This suggests that the straits near Jurong witnessed a significant role in the ancient maritime Silk Road. Although not mapped by Linschoten, the location of Selat Sembilan was later identified in Philip Jackson&#x27;s 1828 survey of Singapore. Despite much land-reclamation works along most coastal parts of Jurong and Tuas, Selat Sembilan still exists today as Selat Jurong, stretching along the entire coastline of the region.

Even before the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, small settlements had already been built along Jurong&#x27;s coastal areas as well as the present-day site of Jurong Island, Pulau Damar Laut and Pulau Sembulan. Such squatters were inhabited by the native Orang laut, and there also immigrants from the nearby Dutch East Indies and Malaya.

===Colonial era (1819 to 1942)===

====Earliest developments====
Post-colonization, Jurong had a small population of inhabitants scattered along the banks of the area&#x27;s two main rivers, Sungei Jurong and Sungei Pandan. It consisted mainly of a large Chinese and Malay migrant population.

The majority of the Chinese population was Hokkien-speaking, immigrating from Anxi County in the province of Fujian, China. A Teochew demographic was also prevalent in Jurong. Originating from the City of Jieyang, the Teochew-speaking population mainly settled along the westernmost portions of Jurong.

Most of the Malays and Orang Laut in the area were natives of the land, settling in squatters and villages located along the coast of Jurong long before the founding of Singapore as a British colony in 1819. There were also other ethnic Malay groups that came down from the rest of the Malay Archipelago who migrated from various parts of present-day Malaysia and Indonesia. However, the exact statistics concerning foreign Malays settling in Jurong after 1819 is not clear.

In a visit to the area in 1848, the then-Chief Surveyor of Singapore, John Turnbull Thomson, made one of the earliest accounts regarding human settlements in Jurong.

He described the demographics along Sungei Jurong as such:

Thomson also gave his description on the population along Sungei Pandan:

With the increase in population size over the years, the need for a mode of travel to and from the Town of Singapore, was necessary. Between 1852 and 1853, the first few portions of Jurong Road were paved to connect villages around Jurong to the metropolitan areas of Singapore Town and the rest of the island. This first portion of Jurong Road started from the seventh milestone of Bukit Timah Road ending along the head of Sungei Jurong. Although it isn&#x27;t known when the rest of the road was paved, by 1936, the road stretched up to the district of Tuas.

=====An American expedition=====
In 1853, US Navy Commodore Matthew C. Perry led a maritime expedition to Japan in an attempt to open up the country (then under self-imposed isolation) to the world for trade and the possible building of political and economic ties.

The fleet of the Perry Expedition stopped over at a few countries before reaching the Japanese archipelago. One of the few docking locations during the trip was Singapore. This made it the second time that the United States had made a diplomatic presence on the island since the Exploring Expedition.

Perry&#x27;s crew anchored their fleet of two frigates and two sloops-of-war along Selat Sembilan and Sungei Jurong, where they surveyed the surroundings of the strait and the river.

Wilhelm Heine and Eliphalet Brown, two of the official expedition&#x27;s artists, were tasked at producing a lithograph depicting the villages along Sungei Jurong. The resulting image was one of the earliest illustrations of colonial-era Jurong.

The interesting point of the image is the scene of a forest fire shown in the background. This was common at the time as such raging wildfires were often rampant and common throughout most of Jurong in the mid-19th century. Another point worthy of note in the image is the United States flag seen affixed on the stern of the sampan in the foreground.

====Earliest industries====

=====Agriculture and aquaculture=====
Before the early 1960s, the area was dominated by small and large plantations, cultivating crops such as pineapple, pepper, gambier and nutmeg. These crops provided key sources of income for the district&#x27;s population. Among them, gambier was the primary export of Jurong&#x27;s plantations during the early period. Valued for its practical uses and medicinal properties, gambier became a highly profitable crop for Chinese kangchu-owners, local communities and other plantation owners, both local and foreign. In 1855, the Municipal Committee of the British colonial government reported the existence of 20 legally-recognised gambier plantations existing within Jurong. However, this figure is likely an underestimation, as numerous illegal plantations were also set up in the area.

Rubber was also a popular agricultural industry in Jurong during this period and was regarded as a strong competitor to the thriving gambier plantation businesses. By the first half of the 20th century, rubber tapping and plantation practices had largely replaced the planting and harvesting of gambier, which had previously dominated Jurong&#x27;s agricultural scene. A notable example of a business that transitioned from gambier to rubber cultivation was the plantation firm owned by Chinese business magnate Chew Boon Lay. The extensive land his plantation stood on became associated with his name. Today, this area is known as Boon Lay Place, a subzone within the new town of Jurong West.

Aside from the reliance on cash crops and large plantations, fishing was also another prominent source of income for the locals in Jurong. This livelihood was predominantly undertaken by the local Malay and Orang Laut community, most of whom chose to live along the coastlines of Jurong or had already settled there for many generations. Fishing was also conducted along two prominent rivers in the area, Sungei Jurong and Sungei Pandan.

Numerous prawn farms were also set up along these two rivers where crustacean species thrived naturally. By the 1950s, 500 acres of land in Jurong were specifically designated for prawn farming. This was roughly half of the total land used for prawn farms across Singapore at that time.

=====Manufacturing and processing=====
For some time before the period of rapid industrialisation occurring in Jurong throughout the 1960s, Jurong was already a host to several businesses in the heavy industry (primarily dealing with construction and manufacturing), most notably, the brickwork industrial sector. Local businesses involved in brick manufacturing and earthenware production were largely set up around Yunnan in Jurong West, where the soil conditions there could yield much clay and terracotta. Although almost all of these factories and industries closed down over the years (most were shut down by the late 1990s and early 2000s), the brickwork industry remains significant in Jurong, primarily through its historical legacy and enduring influence.

The earliest brick factories in Jurong emerged in the 1920s, exporting large quantities of building materials to construction sites around Singapore and Malaya (now Malaysia). Among the notable factories was Jurong Brickworks, established in the 1930s. It became one of Singapore&#x27;s largest privately owned brick manufacturers and suppliers. At its peak in the 1970s, the company manufactured more than three million bricks per month. Jurong Brickworks was eventually shut down in 2005, with the entire manufacturing plant demolished later that year.

Another notable earthenware-production business located in Jurong is the Thow Kwang Dragon Kiln. Set up by Chinese immigrants in the 1940s, this pottery manufacturer, along with its neighbouring counterpart, the Jalan Bahar Clay Studios, continues to exist to this day and remains the only possessor of a pair of dragon kilns in Singapore. Although located in an area that is traditionally a part of Jurong, the kilns are technically located next to Nanyang Technological University, which is situated in the Western Water Catchment.

=====Similar business ventures=====
Aside from his plantation, Chew Boon Lay also owned one of the earliest factories (a manufacturing plant) that was located in Jurong. During its time in business operation from 1950 to 1958, the manufacturing plant produced a wide range of canned goods (foodstuff) that ranged from kaya to curry and even peanut butter. It was located along Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim and was opposite the location of the former Jurong Bird Park. This same building was also a temporary location for the management offices of the Jurong Town Corporation in 1968.

===Second World War (1941–45)===

====101 Special Training School====
Following the invasion of Thailand in the beginning of December 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army was rapidly heading southwards down the Malay Peninsula towards Singapore. It was rather obvious, by then, to many that a Japanese military assault on the island was nearly imminent. In light of the oncoming threat, the Oriental Mission of the UK&#x27;s Special Operations Executive chose to set up a training institution/school in Singapore to assist and train members of possible anti-Japanese resistance movements throughout Japanese-occupied British Malaya and, later, Singapore.

One proposed site for the training base was at Pulau Ubin. However, the suggestion was dropped due to several reasons. Issues such as the difficulty of clearing thick jungle foliage, the cost of building and developing the training base&#x27;s site, the lack of access to freshwater and the risk of contagious malaria and other diseases made Pulau Ubin unsuitable for a possible location. Later on, during the formation of the Singapore Armed Forces, the proposed site for the training bases were located at Pasir Laba and Pulau Tekong respectively. Pasir Laba was the first to be built during the formation of SAF, and set up the live firing zone in the west. Pulau Tekong was the second to be built.

The SOE eventually settled on a small, isolated island known as Tanjong Balai. Located at the mouth of Sungei Jurong, the island featured a single man-made structure consisting of a lone bungalow formerly owned by Jewish businessman Joseph Brook David. In addition to the bungalow, the island was concealed within a canopy of secondary-type rainforest. Its location offered the advantage of accessibility either by boat or via a discreet jungle path.

With the SOE&#x27;s settling down at Tanjong Balai, the Number 101 Special Training School was created and mainly trained its personnel in the various fields of sabotage, reconnaissance and espionage to prepare them for resistance efforts against Japanese occupation forces.

With the invading Japanese military pushing into Singapore by February in 1942, the training base was quickly closed down with the destruction of related documents and the abandonment of the training base Tanjong Balai. A new SOE training base was later established in Burma in the former capital city of Myanmar at Rangoon.

Today, the island of Tanjong Balai and the training base located there are largely unheard of by many modern-day Singaporeans. The island has since been subsumed by Jurong Port after further land-reclamation works were carried out in the 1980s to expand the harbour.

===Modern history (1960–present)===

====The need to industrialise====
Post-war Singapore was plagued with significant economic and financial challenges. A largely uneducated population and a chronic lack of job opportunities contributed to a scarcity of skilled manpower. By the end of the decade of the 1950s, the unemployment rate in post-war Singapore stood at about 14%, encompassing an estimated 200,000 people across the population. Compounding the issues of widespread unemployment and resulting poverty was the government&#x27;s need to address the country&#x27;s high birth rate, which was increasing annually by about 4%.

With the Cold War and the then-constant threat of communism spreading from Malaya, the country&#x27;s Legislative Assembly was being pressured to keep the British-ruled crown colony financially stable and economically strong.

In 1959, the People&#x27;s Action Party won the first general election held in a self-governing Singapore. A crucial element of the party&#x27;s agenda upon coming to power was the promise of creating more and better employment opportunities for the people and the need to build and strengthen the weak economy of a newly developing self-governing nation. To address this urgent need, the new PAP-led government tasked Dr. Goh Keng Swee, the then-finance minister was quickly put in charge of tackling Singapore&#x27;s economic challenges.

Dr. Goh determined that industrialisation was the only way to improve and strengthen Singapore&#x27;s weak economy. He envisioned the development of a major industrial town featuring modern industries mainly based in the manufacturing sector, such as shipyards, steelworks, chemical plants and other factories. While the idea of industrialisation in Singapore was not new, Dr. Goh&#x27;s plans for an industrial estate in Jurong were far more ambitious and comprehensive than previous proposals.

====Jurong Industrial Estate====

On the 4th of July in 1960, the Legislative Assembly of Singapore announced a proposal to construct a new industrial town in Jurong. The entire project, which totalled $45.7 million in cost, begun almost immediately after the proposal&#x27;s announcement, with the immediate processes of planning and designing taking place in August in that same year.

For Jurong&#x27;s industrialisation, Singapore sought international assistance for its economic development. The United Nations Industrial Survey Mission assigned Dutch economic/financial advisor Dr Albert Winsemius to lead the nation&#x27;s economic development efforts. The same UN mission also deployed Frenchman Mr P. Schereschewsky to survey Jurong&#x27;s suitability as an industrial town.

In 1961, the Economic and Development Board (the EDB) was formed to spearhead Singapore&#x27;s industrialisation. That same year, earthworks commenced for the development of Jurong&#x27;s industrial estate. In 1962, the then-finance minister of Singapore, Dr. Goh Keng Swee, laid the foundation stone for the newly established National Iron and Steel Mills, the first factory in the new industrial estate. This factory, now known as NatSteel, is currently a subsidiary of Tata Steel of India. At that time, many Singaporeans were skeptical of Dr. Goh&#x27;s ambitious plan to industralise Jurong, giving it the nickname &quot;Goh&#x27;s Folly&quot;. They were quickly dispelled when 24 factories of various types were established in 1963. In May 1965, Jurong Port became operational.

In 1968, the Jurong Town Corporation was established to direct and manage Jurong&#x27;s development. By this time, a total of 14.78 square kilometres of industrial land had been prepared, with 153 factories fully operational and 46 more under construction. As Singapore&#x27;s economy continued to grow rapidly, addressing the challenge of accommodating new businesses and industries became increasingly pressing. To meet these demands, seven islets off the southern coast of Jurong were merged to create the 30 square-kilometre Jurong Island, which became the hub for oil, chemical and petrochemical factories, manufacturing industries and plants in Singapore. The construction and development of Jurong Island began in the early 1990s and was scheduled to be completed by 2010. By 2016, much of the development works have been completed, with some newer developments continuing to emerge. A number of heavy-type industrial companies and firms, such as DuPont and Teijin Polycarbonate, began operations on the island in the late 1990s. The Jurong Island Causeway provides the only land-based link to Jurong Island from mainland Singapore. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, access to Jurong Island became heavily restricted. An entry/exit security pass is now required for all employees working at Jurong Island, and cameras and all other recording equipment are banned from being transported into the island.

====Townships of Jurong====


The first few low-rise flats in Jurong Town emerged in the precinct of Taman Jurong between 1963 and 1964, developed by the Housing and Development Board. Around this time, other notable housing estates, such as Boon Lay, began breaking ground. Despite the new residential developments, Jurong lacked a growing population, largely due to its location and the lack of infrastructure around the region at the time.

The development of Jurong East and West started in 1979 when estates such as Taman Jurong, Boon Lay Place, Bukit Batok, Bukit Gombak, Hong Kah, Teban Gardens and Yuhua were built, mostly due to the resettlement of Hong Kah and surrounding villages. Boon Lay Place, Taman Jurong and Hong Kah formed Jurong West New Town. Yuhua, Teban Gardens, Bukit Batok and Bukit Gombak formed Jurong East New Town.

In 1982, Jurong West New Town started expanding as Jurong West Extension, which saw the realignment of the PIE, rerouting it to pass the southern boundary of present-day NTU. The former section of the PIE was converted into Jurong West Avenue 2, and Upper Jurong Road was renamed to Jurong West Avenue 4. Pioneer Road was extended northward from present-day Upper Jurong Road, becoming Pioneer Road North, to connect to the new PIE exit. This signalled the start of the development of Jurong West Extension (Yunnan, Pioneer and Gek Poh). The N9 estate was the first to be built, while the N6 estate was the last, constructed only in the early 2000s. The MRT Line was extended from Lakeside to Boon Lay in 1990 and again to Pioneer in 2009.

====Spyros disaster====

On 12 October 1978, a Greek oil tanker, &quot;Spyros&quot;, exploded at Jurong Shipyard, killing more than 70 people in the immediate vicinity. The result was one of the worst man-made disasters/calamities since the Second World War in Singapore and the worst industrial accident since the country gained full independence in 1965.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Private====
Jurong is well connected to the rest of Singapore by road, with Kranji Expressway linking them to the northern part of Singapore, Pan Island Expressway linking them to the Eastern part of Singapore and the Ayer Rajah Expressway linking them to the south-eastern part of Singapore. Clementi Avenue 6 and Jurong Town Hall Road complement the 3 expressways, topping off the well-built road connection from Jurong to all parts of the island.

====Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)====
The region is well-connected to the MRT system, served by two MRT lines, the East West Line and the North South Line.

Two MRT stations serve the Jurong East region:
* Jurong East
* Chinese Garden

Three MRT stations serve the Jurong West region:
* Lakeside
* Boon Lay
* Pioneer 

Four MRT stations serve the Pioneer &amp; Tuas industrial areas:
* Joo Koon
* Gul Circle
* Tuas Crescent
* Tuas West Road
* Tuas Link

Scheduled to be completed in 2029 and 2032 respectively, the Jurong Region MRT line and Cross Island MRT line will help to further connect commuters to places in Jurong and the rest of Singapore.

====Bus====
Jurong is served by public bus services originating from 5 interchanges and 1 bus depot, namely the Jurong East, Jurong Town Hall, Boon Lay, Joo Koon &amp; Tuas bus interchanges and Soon Lee Bus Depot.

===Economy===

====Commercial====
The more notable shopping malls in Jurong are Jurong Point Shopping Mall in Pioneer and the cluster of malls in Jurong East, as part of the Jurong Gateway commercial hub. These include IMM, Jem and Westgate.

The largest suburban mall in Singapore, Jurong Point Shopping Mall is well-accessible by bus services from all the residential precincts of Jurong except Yuhua and Teban Gardens. This mall targets young adults and families with stalls selling fashion, food and beverages, sports, entertainment and lifestyle products. It also serves the elderly population with body-wellness stores and healthcare centres located at levels 4 and 5 of the mall. It is well linked to the Boon Lay MRT station and Boon Lay Bus Interchange.

The largest outlet mall in Singapore, IMM is located within walking distance from Jurong East MRT station. The mall contains a Kopitiam food court on Level 3, as well as many furniture stores and other retail stores. These include a Daiso department store and a Giant Hypermarket.

J-Walk, a pedestrian network made up of elevated walkways and at-grade sheltered walkways, connects the shopping malls and hospitals in Jurong East to Jurong East MRT station.

There are other shopping malls in Jurong, but are only well known within the precinct they are located in. Such malls include Hong Kah Point in Hong Kah and Taman Jurong Shopping Centre in Taman Jurong.

===Tourism===

*Singapore Science Centre
*Snow City
*Singapore Discovery Centre
*Singapore Army Museum
*Jurong Bird Park (ceased and relocated to Mandai in 2023)
*Jurong Lake Gardens
*ABC Waters @ Jurong Lake (largest man-made floating wetlands with a total area of 3,850 sqm) 

==Education==
There are multiple primary and secondary schools in each precinct of Jurong. Examples include the Shuqun Primary School established in 1925 in Jurong West, as well as River Valley High School established in 1956 in Boon Lay. 

Prior to 2019, Jurong had one junior college, Jurong Junior College, located between Hong Kah and Boon Lay. The school has since merged with Pioneer Junior College to form Jurong Pioneer Junior College.

==Politics==
Jurong used to be an independent political constituency in the 1959 general elections. Chia Thye Poh represented the constituency in parliament between 1963 and 1966. Then, Boon Lay Constituency was carved out in 1976 and Hong Kah Constituency in 1984, forming four separate constituencies. Hong Kah Constituency eventually became a GRC that consisted of Nanyang, Hong Kah, Gek Poh and Bukit Batok in 1988. Teban Gardens, Pioneer, Yuhua and Taman Jurong were under Bukit Timah Constituency and the N9 region of Nanyang was under Jurong Constituency all that while.

In 2001, there were major changes in the political constituencies of Jurong. Boon Lay Constituency, together with Teban Gardens and Pioneer, were absorbed into the expanded West Coast GRC. Hong Kah Constituency was re-designed to include towns of Chua Chu Kang (Limbang and Yew Tee) and Bukit Gombak and only Nanyang and Gek Poh remained in the constituency, this time including the N9 region of Nanyang. Jurong Constituency was abolished. Hong Kah and Bukit Batok were regrouped into the newly created Jurong GRC, along with Yuhua and Taman Jurong. As such, the entire political system of Jurong was changed with 3 GRCs as a result.

10 years later, in 2011, Gek Poh, Yuhua and Pioneer were crafted out from each of the three GRCs to become SMCs. In total, there are now six constituencies in Jurong.

Nonetheless, though divided into six separate constituencies, all the precincts are collectively managed by the PAP and known as Jurong.

<text>Friedrich Christian Accum or Frederick Accum (29 March 1769 – 28 June 1838) was a German chemist, whose most important achievements included advances in the field of gas lighting, efforts to keep processed foods free from dangerous additives, and the promotion of interest in the science of chemistry to the general populace. From 1793 to 1821 Accum lived in London. Following an apprenticeship as an apothecary, he opened his own commercial laboratory enterprise. His business manufactured and sold a variety of chemicals and laboratory equipment. Accum, himself, gave fee-based public lectures in practical chemistry and collaborated with research efforts at numerous other institutes of science.

Intrigued by the work of Frederick Winsor, who had been championing the introduction of gas lighting in London, Accum too, became fascinated by this innovation. At the request of the Gas Light and Coke Company, he carried out many experiments in this novel field of inquiry. After a time of close working association with this company, he became a member of its board of directors in 1812. The company was charged with founding the first gasworks in London to supply gas lighting to both private and public areas. Accum was instrumental in the conception and design of this extremely successful gasworks.

The majority of Accum&#x27;s publications were written in English. They were executed in a style that made them quite accessible. Many scientific contributions were brought forth through his writings, which were influential in the popularization of chemistry during this era. In 1820, Accum published &quot;A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons&quot;, in which he denounced the use of chemical additives to food. This work marked the beginning of an awareness of need for food safety oversight. Accum was the first person to tackle the subject and to reach a wide audience through his activities. His book, controversial at the time, found a wide audience and sold well. However, it threatened established practices within the food processing industry, earning him many enemies among the London food manufacturers. Accum left England after a lawsuit was brought against him. He lived out the rest of his life as a teacher at an industrial institution in Berlin.

==Life and work==
===Youth and education===

Accum was born in Bückeburg, Schaumburg-Lippe, about west of Hanover. His father was from Vlotho, and had been in an infantry regiment in the service of Count Wilhelm von Schaumburg-Lippe. In 1755, Accum&#x27;s father converted from Judaism to Protestant Christianity. Soon after, his father married Judith Berth dit La Motte in Bückeburg. Judith was the daughter of a hat maker, who lived in the French community in Berlin, and the granddaughter of a refugee who suffered under the Huguenot persecutions in France.

At the time of his conversion baptism, the senior Accum changed his name from Markus Herz to Christian Accum. In addition to choosing the name &quot;Christian,&quot; Accum&#x27;s father chose to emphasize his newly embraced religion by adopting the surname Accum, which derives from the Hebrew word &quot;Akum,&quot; meaning &quot;not-Jewish.&quot; It is not known whether he did this on his own initiative or because of pressure from his fiancee&#x27;s family. After his marriage, Christian Accum opened his own soap-making shop in Bückeburg at his in-law&#x27;s home. Nine years after his marriage to Judith, he received legal citizenship from the city.

Friedrich Accum attended the Bückeburg Gymnasium Adolfinum and additionally received private tutelage in the subjects of French and English. Following the conclusion of his studies, he finished an apprenticeship as an apothecary with the Brande family in Hanover, who were family friends. The Brandes also conducted business in London and were the apothecaries to the Hanoverian King of England, George III. As one of the leading centers for scientific research and industry at the close of the eighteenth century, London attracted the best and brightest minds of Europe.

===The first year in London===
After gaining experience as an assistant in the apothecary, Accum pursued scientific and medical studies at the School of Anatomy in Great Windmill Street in London. He became acquainted with the surgeon Anthony Carlisle (1768–1842) and the London chemist William Nicholson (1753–1815). In Mr. Nicholson&#x27;s circulating journal, (&quot;Nicholson&#x27;s Journal&quot;)

In the fall of the year 1799, a translation of Franz Carl Achard&#x27;s ground-breaking work on the production of sugar from beets appeared in &quot;Nicholson&#x27;s Journal&quot;. Until that time, sugar cane, which was grown overseas, was the only plant from which sugar could be derived. This information made possible the creation of a domestic sugar industry, and was greeted with great interest. A short time after the article&#x27;s publication, Accum had samples of beet sugar sent from Berlin, and presented them to William Nicholson. This was the first time sugar derived from beets had ever been present in England. Following his careful analysis of both types of sugar, Nicholson published a detailed report in the January edition of his journal, stating that there was no appreciable difference in taste between the two.

===Laboratory worker, merchant and private tutor===
In 1800, Accum and his family changed residence in London from 17 Haymarket to 11 Old Compton Street. There he would live for the next twenty years. His family home also served as a school, an experimental laboratory and place he sold chemicals and scientific instruments. Accum&#x27;s business cards of the time described his activities thus:

Mr Accum acquaints the Patrons and Amateurs of Chemistry that he continues to give private Courses of Lectures on Operative and Philosophical Chemistry, Practical Pharmacy and the Art of Analysis, as well as to take Resident Pupils in his House, and that he keeps constantly on sale in as pure a state as possible, all the Re-Agents and Articles of Research made use of in Experimental Chemistry, together with a complete Collection of Chemical Apparatus and Instruments calculated to Suit the conveniences of Different Purchasers.

For many years, Accum&#x27;s establishment was the only significant institution in England that provided lectures on the theory of chemistry as well as training in laboratory practice. Amateurs were welcome to perform simple experiments on site to enhance their knowledge. Accum&#x27;s teachings attracted various prominent students. These included the well-known London politician and later prime minister Lord Palmerston, the Duke of Bedford, and the Duke of Northumberland. Additionally, his laboratory was the first in Europe to be visited by students and scientists from the United States, among whom were Benjamin Silliman and William Dandridge Peck. When Silliman later became Professor of Chemistry at Yale College (precursor to Yale University) in New Haven, he ordered his first laboratory equipment from Accum in London. Accum&#x27;s biographer, Charles Albert Browne, stated in his 1925 work that some of the older American colleges still had sales receipts from Accum&#x27;s London business.

With the development of new laboratory apparatus, Accum positioned himself in the middle market range with respect to cost and usability. Accum developed portable laboratory kits, intended for farmers, for the analysis of soils and stones. With affordable prices ranging from three to eighty pounds sterling, these chests were the first truly portable laboratories.

===Teacher and researcher===
In March 1801, Frederick Accum was offered a position at the Royal Institution in Ablemarle Street, a research institute founded two years earlier by Count Rumford.
By 1803, Accum had published a series of articles in &quot;Nicholson&#x27;s Journal&quot;, which discussed a number of subjects: investigating methods to determine the purity of medicines, determining the existence of benzoic acids in vanilla extract, observing the explosivity of sulphur-phosphorus mixtures.
In 1803 one of Accum&#x27;s most significant publications was completed. Cole, Accum&#x27;s biographer states that this book, &quot;System of Theoretical and Practical Chemistry&quot;, &quot;was the first text-book of general chemistry written in the English language to be based on Lavoisier&#x27;s new principles; it is outstanding, also, in that it is written in a popular style, the subject matter being graduated as with a modern text-book.&quot;

Accum held his first lecture on chemistry and mineralogy in a small room in his house on Old Compton Street. His audience grew so rapidly that he soon had to rent the Medical Theatre on Cork Street. After resigning from the Royal Institution and taking a new position with the &quot;Surrey Institution&quot;, he continued with his popular lectures. An advertisement in &quot;The Times&quot; on 6 January 1809 indicates that Accum offered a course on mineralogy and the chemical analysis of metals every Wednesday evening.

His increasing interest in mineralogy at this time is also apparent from the titles of two books he authored between 1803 and 1809. The first was a two volume work that appeared in 1804 entitled &quot;A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals&quot;, which was reissued in 1808 as &quot;A Manual of Analytical Mineralogy&quot;. In 1809 he published &quot;Analysis of a Course of Lectures on Mineralogy&quot;. Beginning in 1808, while at the &quot;Surrey Institution&quot;, Accum also published, a series of articles on the chemical properties and composition of mineral water in Alexander Tilloch&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Journal&quot;.

In 1811, when the Parisian saltpetre manufacturer Bernard Courtois made iodine for the first time from the kelp ash, his discovery was greeted with great interest by experts. Accum was among the first chemists in England to undertake experiments to isolate iodine. In two articles published in Tilloch&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Journal&quot; in January and February 1814, Accum described the iodine content of different kinds of seaweed and gave a detailed account of a process for iodine production.

===Accum&#x27;s role in the history of gaslight===
Artificial lighting of any sort was largely absent during the industrial development of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Using candles or oil lamps to illuminate a textile factory was costly, and economically unsound. With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they also had to be lit more brightly for longer periods of time. Driven by great demand, and made possible through Lavoisier&#x27;s theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, the end of the 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in lighting technology.

The production of gases from coal had been noted by Henry Clayton. He shared this observation with Robert Boyle in a letter written in the 17th century. The letter was published in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; of the &quot;Royal Society&quot; in 1739. Clayton wrote:

I then got some Coal from one of the Pits nearest thereunto, which I distilled in a Retort in an open Fire. At first there came over only Phlegm, afterwards a black Oil, and then likewise a Spirit arose, which I could noways condense, but it forced my Lute, or broke my Glasses. Once, when it had forced the Lute, coming close thereto, in order to try to repair it, I observed that the Spirit which issued out caught Fire at the Flame of the Candle, and continued burning with Violence as it issued out, in a Stream, which I blew out, and lighted again, alternately, for several times.

Clayton&#x27;s findings did not have any practical application until the end of the 18th century. The gas produced during the coking of coal was allowed to escape unused until William Murdoch began to promote coal gas as an illuminant. Other such experiments, though limited in depth, had been done by: George Dixon in 1780 in Cockfield, Jean-Pierre Minckelers in 1785 in Louvain, and Archibald Cochrane in 1787 at his estate Culross Abbey. The true prototypes for later gasworks were first constructed in 1802 at the Soho Foundry and in 1805 at George Lee&#x27;s cotton mill in Salford close to Manchester. However innovative the new technology, it was met with great skepticism by many critics. As late as 1810 Murdock was asked in a committee of the House of Commons: &quot;Do you mean to tell us that it will be possible to have a light without a wick?&quot; Not until the second decade of the 19th century did gaslight spread from industrial mills to urban street lighting and domestic lighting. Accum played a crucial role in this unfolding revolution.

Accum became involved with the production of gas for lighting purposes through the efforts of Friedrich Albert Winsor (1763–1830), another German émigré, who had been waging a longstanding publicity campaign. In 1809, Accum was asked to appear before a Parliamentary committee that was considering granting a charter for a gaslight company Winsor had been promoting. While unsuccessful in its first attempt, the bill passed in 1810 and the company was incorporated under the name &quot;Gas Light and Coke Company&quot;. The newly incorporated company met the conditions laid out in the bill and began operating in 1812 with Accum as a member of its board of directors. Accum oversaw the construction of a gas plant on Curtain Road, which was the first such plant in the history of gaslight. After that time, gaslight was no longer limited to industrial mills and was introduced into urban life. Westminster Bridge was lighted with gas lamps in 1813, and a year later, the streets in Westminster followed. In 1815, Accum published &quot;Description of the Process of Manufacturing Coal-Gas&quot;. In the introduction, Accum compared the newly formed gas utility with the water companies that had been operating in London since the early 18th century: &quot;Through gas, it will be possible to have light in all rooms, as is presently the case with water.&quot; When this book was translated into German in Berlin in 1815, an explanatory note had to be added, as no such water utilities existed there: &quot;There are many private homes in England that are provided with pipes in the walls so that in almost all rooms, all one needs to do to get water is open a faucet.&quot;

In London, in 1814, there was a single gasometer of , by 1822, there were four gas companies, whose gasometers had a total combined volume of almost a million ft3 To keep delivery routes for the gas pipelines as short as possible, gas plants were set up within the city districts where the gas was consumed. The arrival of these types of chemical plants to inhabited parts of the city provoked public criticism of the new technology. This was also directed at poisonous effluent generated by the plant operations. These harsh critiques were especially fierce once accidental explosions occurred at some plants. Accum, who by this point was a leading proponent of gaslight in addition to his work as a chemist, strongly refuted these criticisms in his writings. Through careful analysis he showed that as a whole, accidents were caused by carelessness of plant workers rather than problems with the technology, and were therefore avoidable.

From early on in its conception, Accum had been concerned with the byproducts of coal gas production, which included tar and sulphur compounds. These were typically buried or dumped into nearby waterways. The ammonium and sulphur compounds were especially damaging to the environment. In 1820, Accum began demanding legal measures to prevent the discharge of these byproducts into the sewage systems and rivers.

===&quot;There is death in the pot&quot;===
In 1820 Accum began the public struggle against harmful food additives with his book entitled &quot;A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons&quot;. Some additives derived from plants, and used as preservatives or to alter tastes or appearance, had already been in use for some time. The beginning of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the industrial preparation and packaging of foods. The drastic increase of additives used in these processes became a serious health concern. The production and distribution of food, instead of being one between local farmers and townspeople, increasingly became a centralized process in large factories. The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals and the absence of laws moderating their use, made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits at a cost to the public health. Accum was the first to publicly proclaim the hazards of this practice and to reach a wide audience with his concerns.
Accum alludes to his moral stance on food adulterations as he claims that:

The man who robs a fellow subject of a few shillings on the high-way, is sentenced to death; while he who distributes a slow poison to a whole community, escapes punishment.

A thousand copies of &quot;A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons&quot; were sold within a month of its publication.

The various chapters of the book alternate between harmless forgeries such as mixing dried pea grounds in coffee, and much more dangerous contamination by truly poisonous substances. Accum explained to his readers that there was a high lead content in Spanish olive oil, caused by the lead containers used to clear the oil, and recommended using oil from other countries such as France and Italy, where this was not practiced. He warned against bright green sweets sold by itinerant merchants in the streets of London as the colour was produced with &quot;sapgreen&quot;, a colorant with high copper content. &quot;Vinegar&quot;, he explained to his readers, &quot;was frequently mixed with sulphuric acid in order to increase its acidity.&quot;

Accum paid particular attention to beer, introducing the subject with the comment: &quot;Malt beverages, and especially porter, the preferred drink of the inhabitants of London and other large cities, is among the items which is most frequently adulterated in the course of supply.&quot; He claimed that English beer was occasionally mixed with molasses, honey, vitriol, pepper and even opium. Among the most shocking customs he pointed out was the practice of adding fishberries, part of the family Menispermaceae, to porter. It became evident during the French Revolutionary Wars that the practice was getting out of hand, and Accum attributed the intoxicating power of the drink to the addition of this plant matter.

The &quot;Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons&quot; has two further notable characteristics. First, like Accum&#x27;s earlier writings, it was written with descriptions of the simple techniques of analytical chemistry he employed, thereby making them more accessible to his readers. He wanted to make every test repeatable in the simplest possible way by a non-expert. Accum wrote in the foreword to his first edition:

In stating the experimental proceedings necessary for the detection of the frauds which it has been my object to expose, I have confined myself to the task of pointing out such operations only as may be performed by persons unacquainted with chemical science; and it has been my purpose to express all necessary rules and instructions in the plainest language, divested of those recondite terms of science, which would be out of place in a work intended for general perusal.

The second characteristic was that Accum did not limit his campaign to simply exposing problems. At the end of every chapter, he included names of merchants of who had in years prior to 1820 been caught adulterating foodstuffs. In this way, Accum tried to deprive them of business and thereby had an effect on the London economy.

===Reaction to &quot;Treatise on Adulterations of Food&quot;===
Accum was well aware before the publication of his book that mentioning specific names from London&#x27;s business world would provoke a resistance and a possibly a severe reaction. In the foreword to the first edition he called the publication of the names of those adulterating foodstuffs an &quot;invidious office&quot; and a &quot;painful duty,&quot; which he undertook as a verification for his statements. Although he further stated that he carefully avoided citing any except those authenticated in Parliamentary documents and other records, this did not save him from the ire of his opponents. By the time the second edition appeared, he mentioned in the foreword that he had received threats. At the same time, this did not stop him from putting &quot;the unwary on their guard&quot; against the deceits of unscrupulous men. He further added that he wished to notify his hidden enemies that he would report for posterity the crimes these swindlers and their base associates had been found guilty of in public justice—that is, of having made basic foodstuffs poisonous.

===Scandal and lawsuit===
The process that ultimately led to Accum&#x27;s departure from England and return to Germany began a few months after the publication of his book on the poisoning of foodstuffs. For a long time, many contradictory accounts have been given of the exact circumstances of his exile. Finally in 1951, R. J. Cole, in an addendum to the minutes of &quot;Royal Institution&quot;, proved that the presentation of the events adopted in the article in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, and also later in the &quot;Allgemeinen Deutschen Biographie&quot;.

Cole completely reprinted the minutes of an extraordinary meeting of the Royal Institution of 23 December 1820, which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on 5 November 1820, a number of pages were removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books Accum had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut a small hole in the wall of the reading room to watch Accum from an adjoining room. On the evening of 20 December, as recorded in the minutes, Sturt could see Accum tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of &quot;Nicholson’s Journal&quot;. Accum&#x27;s premises on Old Compton Street were searched on the order of a magistrate for the City of London, and torn pages were indeed discovered there. These could be matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution.

The Magistrate after hearing the whole of the Case observed that however valuable the books might be from which the leaves found in Mr Accum’s house had been taken, yet the leaves separated from them were only waste paper. If they had weighed a pound he would have committed him for the value of a pound of waste paper, but this not being the case he discharged him.

The Royal Institution committee that met on 23 December 1820 was not, however, satisfied with this judgment, and decided to take further legal action against Accum. On 10 January 1821, an open letter directed to Earl Spencer, the president of the Institution, appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; defending Accum. The letter was signed &quot;A.C&quot;, and Cole supposed that the author was the surgeon Anthony Carlisle, who had been friends with Accum since the first years of the latter&#x27;s stay in London. This unsought support availed Accum little, as the minutes of the Royal Institution from 16 April 1821 show. These report the commencement of a lawsuit against Accum for theft of paper valued at 14 pence. Two of his friends were included in the indictment: the publisher Rudolph Ackermann and the architect John Papworth. These three appeared in court and paid altogether 400 pounds sterling as surety.

===Return to Germany===
In the two years before his return to Germany, Accum had published a number of books dealing with nutrition chemistry. In 1820, he published two works, one on beer production (&quot;A Treatise on the Art of Brewing)&quot; and another on wine (&quot;A Treatise on the Art of Making Wine)&quot;. The following year appeared &quot;Culinary Chemistry&quot;, in which Accum provided practical information about the scientific basis of cooking. He also published a book on bread (&quot;A Treatise on the Art of Making Good and Wholesome Bread)&quot;. Even when he had returned to Germany, his works continued to be reprinted and were translated into French, Italian and German, reaching a wide readership in Europe, as well as in the US after it was reprinted there.

Immediately upon his arrival in Germany, Accum went to the town of Althaldensleben. There, the industrialist Johann Gottlob Nathusius had acquired various estates and was using them to found a sprawling industrial settlement. Nathusius was a German pioneer in the field of sugar production from beets, and had established a factory for its production in that town between 1813 and 1816. It was probably Nathusius’ extensive library and chemical laboratory that drew Accum. He remained only a short time in Althaldensleben, however, as he soon got a professorship at the Gewerbeinstitut and the Bauakademie in Berlin. His teaching in the areas of physics, chemistry, and mineralogy, were collected in the two volume work, &quot;Physische und chemische Beschaffenheit der Baumaterialien, deren Wahl, Verhalten und zweckmässige Anwendung&quot;, published in Berlin in 1826. It was the only work Accum published originally in German.

A few years after settling down in Berlin, Accum had a house built at 16 Marienstraße (later 21 Marienstraße), where he dwelt until his death. During his last years, he suffered from a bad case of gout, which ultimately led to his death. His illness took a serious turn for the worse in June 1838, and he rapidly deteriorated. On 28 June, approximately 16 years after he return to Germany, Accum died at the age of 69 in Berlin. He was buried there at the Dorotheenstädtischen Friedhof.

==Bibliography and primary sources==
The first biographical sketch of Friedrich Accum&#x27;s life was written by the American agricultural chemist and historian of science Charles Albert Browne, Jr. in 1925. He studied the life and works of Accum closely for ten years, which he was able to complement with information from civil and ecclesiastical sources in Bückeburg. His enthusiasm for the subject was so great that he traveled to Germany in July 1930 to meet with Hugo Otto Georg Hans Westphal (26 August 1873 – 15 September 1934), a great-grandson of Accum&#x27;s. Brown&#x27;s last writing on the subject, which appeared in 1948 in &quot;Chymia&quot;, a journal for the history of chemistry, relied to a great extent on the information he gathered from Hans Westphal. Three years later, R. J. Cole published an outline of Accum&#x27;s life based on English sources. He was particularly concerned with bringing new information to light about the judicial process of 1821. Like Browne, Cole also provided relatively little data about the last part of Accum&#x27;s life in Berlin. A modern presentation of Accum&#x27;s life and works that fills in the lacuna in the available biographies has not been written. Lawson Cockroft of the &quot;Royal Society of Chemistry&quot; in London observed that Friedrich Accum was one of those chemists who, despite significant achievements in his lifetime, was by and large forgotten today.
Probably the best known pictorial representation of Accum was an engraving by James Thomson made in July 1820 for the English journal &quot;European Magazine&quot;. It shows Accum sitting at a table close to a gas lamp. Thomson&#x27;s engraving was probably based on an oil painting by the London portrait painter Samuel Drummond (1765–1844), who had shown Accum in a similar pose in a painting produced a few years prior to this. In addition, Accum&#x27;s brother-in-law, the artist Wilhelm Strack, painted an oil portrait that shows Accum as a young man.

A few letter fragments and documents relating to Accum still exist in his family&#x27;s possession. A certificate from the &quot;Gesellschaft naturforschender Freunde&quot; (society of natural philosophical friends), based in Berlin and granting honorary membership to Accum, dated 1 November 1814, was made available online in 2006. A letter from Accum written in London and addressed to his brother Philipp in Bückeburg, about life in London after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, is also available online at Wikisource.

<text>The Minitel, officially known as TELETEL, was an interactive videotex online service accessible through telephone lines. It was the world&#x27;s first and most successful mass-market online service prior to the World Wide Web. It was developed in Cesson-Sévigné, Brittany, by government-owned France Télécom.

The service was initially launched on an experimental basis on 15 July 1980 in Saint-Malo and extended to other regions in autumn 1980. It was commercially introduced throughout France in 1982 by the PTT (Postes, Télégraphes et Téléphones; since 1991, divided into France Télécom and La Poste). From its inception, users were able to make online purchases, book train tickets, access business information services, search the telephone directory, maintain a mailbox, and utilize chat functionalities similar to those now supported by the World Wide Web.

In February 2009, France Télécom reported that the Minitel network still maintained 10 million monthly connections. The service was discontinued by France Télécom on 30 June 2012.

== Name ==
Officially known as TELETEL, the name Minitel is derived from the French title &quot;Médium interactif par numérisation d&#x27;information téléphonique&quot; (Interactive medium for digitized information by telephone).

==History==

Videotex was a crucial element in the telecommunications sector of many industrialized countries, with numerous national post, telephone, and telegraph companies and commercial ventures launching pilot projects. It was viewed as a major force in advancing towards an information society.

In 1978, Postes, Télégraphes et Téléphones (PTT) initiated the design of the Minitel network. By distributing terminals capable of accessing a nationwide electronic directory of telephone and address information, the PTT aimed to increase the utilization of the country’s 23 million phone lines and reduce the costs associated with printing phone books and employing directory assistance personnel. Millions of terminals were given for free (officially loans, and property of the PTT) to telephone subscribers.

The telephone company prioritized ease of use. The French government&#x27;s decision to provide free Minitel terminals to every household was a key factor in the widespread adoption and success of Minitel. By providing a popular service on simple, free equipment, Minitel achieved high market penetration and avoided the chicken and egg problem that hindered the widespread adoption of similar systems in the United States. In exchange for the terminal, Minitel users received only the yellow pages (classified as commercial listings with advertisements), while the white pages were freely accessible on Minitel and could be searched faster than through a paper directory.

In the early 1980s, parallel to the US development of the ARPANET, France launched the Minitel project to bring data networking into homes. According to the PTT, during the first eight years of nationwide operation, 8 billion francs were spent on purchasing terminals, resulting in a profit of after deducting payments to information providers such as newspapers. Additionally, an average of 500 million francs was saved annually by printing fewer phone books.

A trial involving 55 residential and business telephone customers using experimental terminals commenced in Saint-Malo on 15 July 1980, two days after a presentation to President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing on 13 July. This trial expanded to 2,500 customers in other regions in autumn 1980. Beginning in May 1981, 4,000 experimental terminals with a different design were distributed in Ille-et-Vilaine, and commercial service using Minitel terminals was launched in 1982. By the end of 1983, there were 120,000 Minitel terminals in France. It became highly successful in 1984 when the French government distributed free Minitel terminals to households.

Minitel became a financial success for the PTT, as using the service cost the 2022 equivalent of 30 euro cent per minute. The telephone company primarily provided the white pages, while establishing infrastructure for other entities to offer services. Minitel facilitated access to various categories including the phone directory (free), mail-order retail companies, airline or train ticket purchases, information services, databases, message boards, online dating services, and computer games.

By 1985, games and electronic messaging accounted for 42 percent of Minitel traffic, with messaging alone representing 17 percent of traffic by 1988. The platform became particularly popular among young people, who would engage in late-night sessions playing text-based online video games.

By early 1986, 1.4 million terminals were connected to the Minitel network, with plans to distribute an additional million by the end of the year. This expansion faced opposition from newspapers concerned about competition from an electronic network. In 1980, &quot;Ouest-France&quot; expressed the concern that Minitel would &quot;separate people from each other and endanger social relationships.&quot; To mitigate opposition from the newspapers, they were permitted to establish the first consumer services on Minitel. &quot;Libération&quot; offered 24-hour online news, including results from events at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles that occurred overnight in France. Providers promoted their services in their own publications, which helped to market the Minitel network. Newspapers were founded specifically to create Minitel services.

By 1988, three million terminals were installed, with 100,000 new units being added monthly. The telephone directory received 23 million calls per month, with 40,000 updates daily. Approximately six thousand other services were available, with around 250 new ones being added each month.

The emergence of Minitel led to the proliferation of numerous start-up ventures, similar to the later dot-com bubble of World Wide Web-related companies. Many of these small enterprises encountered challenges due to an oversaturated market or poor business practices, such as inadequate infrastructure for online retailers. By the late 1980s, the Minitel system had become widespread in France, with numerous products displaying their Minitel numbers as a direct marketing tool.

Despite initial expectations, &quot;messageries roses&quot; (&quot;pink messages&quot;), adult chat services facilitated by operators posing as receptive women, gained significant traction, causing some discomfort among government officials who preferred to focus on the growing business applications of messaging. Extensive street advertising promoted services such as &quot;3615 Sextel,&quot; &quot;Jane,&quot; &quot;kiss,&quot; &quot;3615 penthouse,&quot; and &quot;men.&quot; These and other pornographic sites faced criticism for their potential accessibility to minors. While the government opted against implementing coercive measures, it underscored the responsibility of parents, rather than governmental intervention, in regulating children&#x27;s online activities. The government did impose a tax on pornographic online services.

Numerous services were covertly operated by conservative newspapers, which publicly expressed disapproval the sex industry. The majority of operators were not the scantily-clad women depicted in the advertisements, but were men engaged in their regular occupations.

By the mid-1990s, it provided over 20,000 services, including home banking and specialized databases. Minitel was widespread in French homes a decade before the Internet became known in the US. France Télécom, maintained steady income from Minitel and cautiously approached the Internet to protect its business model. This slow adaptation paralleled the hesitant adoption of high-definition TV in the U.S., where companies resisted new technologies to safeguard profits. France&#x27;s struggle with Internet adoption reflected typical free-market issues, rather than those associated with centralized economies.

In 1997, recognizing the emerging global Internet society, the French government partially privatized France Télécom, ending its telephone monopoly and introducing competition in the telecommunications sector. This led to reduced prices for telephone communications, allowing more affordable dial-up Internet access by the late 1990s. Minitel became quickly outpaced by the development of the Internet. France Télécom estimated that by the end of 1999, almost 9 million terminals, including web-enabled personal computers (Windows, Mac OS, and Linux), had access to the network, which was used by 25 million people out of a total population of 60 million. Developed by 10,000 companies, nearly 26,000 different services were available by 1996.

== Finances ==
Payment methods included credit cards for purchases and telephone bills, with rates contingent upon the websites visited. Initially, users subscribed to individual services, but adoption surged following the introduction of a &quot;kiosk&quot; model by the telephone company, named after newsagent shops. Charges for Minitel usage and voice calls were amalgamated on the monthly telephone bill without itemized breakdown. Service providers typically received two-thirds of the $10 per hour fee paid by customers as of 1988.

Since the telephone company managed bill collection and users who failed to settle bills risked losing telephone service, the customer acquisition cost for service providers remained low. The consolidated billing system fostered impulse shopping, as users, while browsing, often discovered and utilized additional services beyond their original intention. Given the anonymity of users and services, Minitel usage was prevalent in workplaces where companies covered telephone expenses.

In 1985, France Télécom generated 620 million francs (approximately ) in revenue from Minitel. Throughout the year, 2,000 private companies collectively earned 289 million francs (about ), while Libération, a prominent newspaper, garnered 2.5 million francs (about US$300,000) from the service in September. Despite the increasing prevalence of the World Wide Web, Minitel connections remained stable in the late 1990s, with a consistent monthly volume of 100 million connections alongside 150 million online directory inquiries.

In response to the rising incidence of cybercrime, France Telecom has developed a new contract specifying that all Minitel service operators must identify themselves by providing their name and address. This measure aims to enhance security and accountability within the network.

In 1998, Minitel returned () in revenue, with allocated by France Télécom to service providers. Notably, Minitel sales in the late 1990s constituted nearly 15 percent of total sales for La Redoute and 3 Suisses, prominent mail order companies in France. By 2005, the most popular Minitel application was Teleroute, an online real-time freight exchange, which accounted for nearly 8 percent of Minitel usage.

In December 1985 Minitel users made more than 22 million calls, up 400 percent in one year. In 1994 they made 1,913 million Minitel calls, used the system for 110 million hours, and spent 6.6 billion francs. In 2005, there were 351 million calls for 18.5 million hours of connection, generating of revenue, of which were redistributed to 2,000 service providers (these numbers were declining at around 30 percent per year). There were still six million terminals owned by France Télécom, which had been left with their users in order to avoid recycling problems.

Key utilization of Minitel included banking and financial services, which leveraged Minitel&#x27;s security features, as well as access to professional databases. France Télécom cited 12 million updates to personal carte vitale healthcare cards were facilitated through Minitel.

By 2007, revenue exceeded . This trend persisted into 2010, with revenues reaching , of which 85 percent was allocated to service providers.

== Phonebook ==

The most popular service of the Minitel was the Annuaire Electronique. It garnered significant popularity, with approximately half of the network&#x27;s calls directed on it in 1985. In May of that same year, a nationwide white pages directory covering all 24 million telephone subscribers was introduced, accessible through the phone number 11. Following the adoption of the new French numbering system on 18 October 1996, access to the phone directory transitioned to 3611. Companies had the option to include up to three lines of supplementary information and a rudimentary website. Advertisement space within the Minitel phone directory was managed by the Office d&#x27;Annonces (ODA), today known as Solocal / Pages Jaunes Groupe based in Sèvres, France. In 1991, the &quot;Minitel Website&quot; for the Paris Sony Stores contained already over 100 pages. Today the 3611 Minitel Directory is replaced by the online white or yellow pages.

On 11 February 2009, France Télécom and PagesJaunes jointly announced the cancellation of plans to discontinue the Minitel service in March 2009, despite its continued high usage of its directory assistance service, which was still accessed over a million times monthly. France Télécom retired the service on 30 June 2012, attributing the decision to operational costs and declining customer interest.

==Technology==
Minitel utilized computer terminals featuring a text-only monochrome screen, a keyboard, and a modem, all integrated into a single tabletop unit. These terminals had the capability to display basic graphics using a predefined set of block graphics characters. Color units were eventually offered for an additional fee, they saw limited adoption. Aftermarket printers were also available to users.

Operating over the existing Transpac network, Minitel terminals connected to the system by dialing a short code number, initiating a connection to a PAVI (&quot;Point d&#x27;Accès VIdéotexte&quot;, meaning &quot;videotext access point&quot;) via the subscriber&#x27;s analog telephone line. The PAVI was then digitally linked to the destination servers of the relevant company or administration through Transpac. The surge in popularity of the service led to a temporary disruption in June 1985, lasting two weeks, when an increase in connection attempts per second revealed a dormant software bug.

In France, the widely recognised dial number for accessing Minitel services was 3615, with 3617 reserved for premium services. Minitel service names typically incorporated these numbers as prefixes to signify their association with the system. Billboard advertisements during this period often featured minimal content, comprising an image, company name, and a &quot;3615&quot; number. The inclusion of the &quot;3615&quot; number implied the promotion of a Minitel service. A notable instance of this cultural reference can be observed in the title of the film &quot;3615 code Père Noël&quot;, where a child endeavors to contact Santa Claus using Minitel, to inadvertently connect with a local criminal.

Minitel used a full-duplex data transmission method facilitated by its modem. The downlink operated at a speed of 1200 bit/s (equivalent to 9 KB/min), while the uplink operated at 75 bit/s (equivalent to 0.6 KB/min). This configuration enabled relatively swift downloads by the standards of its time. Referred to colloquially as &quot;1275&quot;, the system was more accurately designated as V.23. Originally designed for general-purpose data communications, it found widespread application in Minitel and analogous services worldwide.

Technically, &quot;Minitel&quot; refers to the terminals, while the network is known as Télétel.

Minitel terminals were equipped with an AZERTY keyboard, reflective of the standard keyboard layout in France, as opposed to the QWERTY layout more commonly used in English-speaking regions. Some early models deviated from this convention, featuring an ABCDEF keyboard arrangement .

==Minitel and the Internet==
The impact of Minitel on the development of the Internet in France remains a topic of significant debate, partly because Minitel offered over a thousand services, many of which are now available on the Internet. In 1986, French university students effectively organized a national strike utilizing Minitel, showcasing an early instance of digital communication tools being employed for technological political objectives. The French government&#x27;s allegiance to the domestically developed Minitel impeded the uptake of the Internet in France. Despite reaching a peak of nine million terminals in the 1990s, there remained 810,000 terminals in the country as late as 2012. Resources within France Télécom were directed towards Minitel development, diverting attention from Internet-related initiatives. The sustained emphasis on Minitel by France Telecom did not significantly impact the adoption or advancement of internet-based companies in France. By 2018, the country is comparable with the other western countries in terms of high-speed internet penetration in households.

==Minitel in other countries==
*Austria: same as in Germany, see &quot;Bildschirmtext&quot;.
*Belgium: Minitel was launched by Belgacom and delivered services led by Teleroute. Although it was used by businesses, it was rarely used by the public. The main reason was that the terminals were not offered for free as in France and that usage of the service was expensive (50 Euro cents a minute). Moreover, there was never much promotion thereof by Belgacom.
*Brazil: Telebrás had a videotex service called &quot;Videotexto&quot; or &quot;VTX&quot; during the 1980s and 1990s with services provided by local telephone companies such as Telesp (now part of Telefônica Vivo). Services included chats, games, telephone list search, and electronic banking, among others. The Minitel protocol is still used by some cable TV companies to provide general information to their customers.
*Canada: Bell Canada experimented with a Minitel-like system known as Alex with terminals called AlexTel. The system was conceptually similar to Minitel, but used the Canadian NAPLPS protocols and North American Bell System RJ-11 standard telephone connectors. Originally launched experimentally in the Montreal area, Alex was then launched in most areas served by Bell Canada (primarily Ontario and Quebec) with offers of a free trial period and terminal. The principal information offering was the telephone directory. Although branded as a &quot;bilingual&quot; (English and French Canadian) service, the majority of other services offered were the experimental ones originally offered in Quebec and completely Francophone. Retention rates were reportedly close to zero. The service closed down shortly after exiting the experimental stage. Telidon was an earlier Canadian text and graphics service using the same technological underpinnings.
*Finland: In 1986, PTL-Tele, then Sonera (now part of Telia Company) launched the on-line service called TeleSampo. TeleSampo included not only videotex services, but also many other Ascii-based Value Added Services (VAS). Roughly at the same time, HPY HTF (now Elisa) launched a videotex service called Infotel . TeleSampo service was switched off in 2004.
*Germany: &quot;Bildschirmtext&quot; (BTX) that existed between 1983 and 2001 is almost as old as Minitel and technically very similar, but it was largely unsuccessful because consumers had to buy expensive decoders to use it. The German postal service held a monopoly on the decoders that prevented competition and lower prices. Few people bought the boxes, so there was little incentive for companies to post content, which in turn did nothing to further box sales. When the monopoly was loosened, it was too late because PC-based online services had started to appear. Some post offices in Germany offered BTX boxes for public use, allowing access to BTX without owning a box.
*Ireland: Minitel was introduced to Ireland by Eir (then called Telecom Éireann) in 1988. The system was based on the French model and Irish services were even accessible from France via the code &quot;36 19 Irlande&quot;. A number of major Irish businesses came together to offer a range of online services, including directory information, shopping, banking, hotel reservations, airline reservations, news, weather and information services. The system was also the first platform in Ireland to offer users access to e-mail outside of a corporate setting. Despite being cutting edge for its time, the system failed to capture a large market and was ultimately withdrawn due to lack of commercial interest. The rise of the internet and other global online services in the early to mid-1990s played a major factor in the death of Irish Minitel. Minitel Ireland&#x27;s terminals were technically identical to their French counterparts, except that they had a Qwerty keyboard and an RJ-11 telephone jack which is the standard telephone connector in Ireland. Terminals could be rented for 5.00 Irish pounds (6.35 euros) per month or purchased for 250.00 Irish pounds (317.43 euros) in 1992.
*Italy: In 1985, the national telephone operator &quot;SIP&quot; – &quot;Società italiana per l&#x27;esercizio telefonico&quot; (now known as Telecom Italia) launched the Videotel service. The system use was charged on a per-page basis. Due to the excessive cost of the hardware and the expensive services, diffusion was very low, leading to the diffusion of a FidoNet-oriented movement. The service was shut down in 1994.
*Netherlands: The then state-owned phone company PTT (now KPN) operated two platforms: Viditel and Videotex Nederland . The main difference was that Viditel used one big central host where Videotex NL used a central access system responsible for realizing the correct connection to the required host: owned and managed by others. Viditel was introduced on 7 August 1980, and required a &quot;Vidimodem&quot; as well as a compatible home computer (one such example was the Philips P2000T which had a built-in Teletext chip) or a television set which could support Teletext; the required equipment itself would cost anywhere between 3,000 and 5,000 Dutch guilders overall. Viditel was shut down in September 1989 due to high operating costs and was succeeded by the cheaper and more widely used Videotex Nederland. The Videotex NL services offered access via several premium rate numbers and the information/service provider could choose the costs for accessing his service. Depending on the number used, the tariff could vary from 0–1 guilders (0.00–0.45 euro) per minute. Some private networks such as &quot;Travelnet&quot; (for travel-agencies) and &quot;RDWNet&quot; for automotive industry, used the same platform as Videotex NL but used dedicated dial-in phone numbers, dedicated access-hardware and also used authentication. Although the protocol used in France for Minitel was slightly different from the international standard one could use the &quot;international&quot; terminal (or PC&#x27;s with the correct terminal-emulation software) to access the French services. It was possible to connect to most French Minitel services via the Dutch Videotex NL network, but the price per minute was considerably higher: most French Minitel services were reachable via the dial-in number 06-7900, which had a tariff of 1 guilder/minute (approx. €0,45/minute). Videotex Nederland was eventually shut down in 1997, and the parent company behind Videotex Nederland was subsequently renamed as Planet Media Group.
*Singapore: Singapore Teleview was first trialled by the Telecom Authority of Singapore (now Singtel) beginning in 1987, and was formally launched in 1991. The Teleview system, while similar in concept to the Minitel and Prestel, was unique in that it was able to display photographic images instead of graphical images used by Minitel and Prestel. Teleview was eventually rendered obsolete by SLIP/PPP-based modem Internet connections in the late 1990s.
*South Africa: Videotex was introduced by Telkom in 1986 and named Beltel. The Minitel was introduced later to popularise the service.
*Spain: Videotex was introduced by Telefónica in 1990 and named Ibertex. The Ibertex was based on the French model but used the German Bildschirmtext CEPT-1 profile.
*Sweden: Swedish state-owned telephone company Televerket (now Telia Company) introduced a similar service, called Teleguide , in 1991. Teleguide was shut down in 1993 due to a contract dispute between Televerket and the vendors IBM and Esselte.
*Switzerland: same as in Germany, see &quot;Bildschirmtext&quot;.
*United Kingdom: The Prestel system was similar in concept to Minitel, using dedicated terminals or software on personal computers to access the network. The number of Prestel subscribers only reached 90 thousand.
*United States: In 1991, France Télécom launched a Minitel service called &quot;101 Online&quot; in San Francisco; this venture was not successful. In the early 1990s, US West (subsequently Qwest and now Lumen Technologies) launched a Minitel service in the Minneapolis and Omaha markets called &quot;CommunityLink&quot;. This joint venture of US West and France Télécom provided Minitel content to IBM PC, Commodore 64, and Apple II owners using a Minitel-emulating software application over a dialup modem. Many of the individual services were the same as or similar to those offered by France Télécom to the French market; in fact, some chat services linked up with France Télécom&#x27;s network in France. The service was fairly short-lived as competing offerings from providers like AOL, Prodigy, and CompuServe as well as independent bulletin board systems and internet service providers offered more services targeted at American users for a lower price. Many of US West&#x27;s Minitel offerings were charged à la carte or hourly while competitors offered monthly all-inclusive pricing and many smaller BBSes were completely free of charge as long as users called a local number. Minitel also offered services directly in the US with a DOS based client that was sent out to customers for use with an IBM PC compatible. In 1983, the publishing company Knight Ridder and AT&amp;T offered a competing service called Viewtron. The service offered news, aviation schedules and educative content, but no way of mail communication, as the publishing company thought communication should be one-way only.

 &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Jurong Island&quot;
&lt;/mapframe&gt;

Jurong Island is an island located to the southwest of the main island of Singapore. It was formed from the amalgamation of seven offshore islands, the islands of Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Ayer Merbau, Pulau Merlimau, Pulau Pesek, Pulau Pesek Kechil (also called Terumbu Pesek), Pulau Sakra (which was a previous merger of Pulau Sakra and Pulau Bakau), Pulau Seraya, Pulau Meskol, Pulau Mesemut Laut, Pulau Mesemut Darat and Anak Pulau. This was done through Singapore&#x27;s land reclamation efforts. Land reclamation on Jurong Island was completed on 25 September 2009, 20 years earlier than scheduled. Pulau Buaya was joined to Jurong Island via reclamation in 2010. Jurong Island forms a land area of about from an initial area of less than , and is the largest of Singapore&#x27;s outlying islands.

==History==
The island was previously a stop on a maritime trade route. Jurong Island used to be a maze of island hideouts frequented by raiding pirates. Later in the early 19th century, entrepreneurs trading gambier altered the area for large scale settlement. In 1848 a British surveyor, John Turnbull Thomson, mentioned there were numerous Chinese and Malay villages in Jurong.

The outlying islands of Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Ayer Merbau, Pulau Merlimau and Pulau Seraya used to house fishing communities comprising small villages up to the 1960s. The villagers lived in Malay-style wooden stilt houses on the palm-fringed islands. Between the late-1960s and early-1970s, three big oil companies planned to house their facilities on Pulau Ayer Chawan for Esso, Pulau Merlimau for Singapore Refinery Company and Pulau Pesek for Mobil Oil.

The Government of Singapore then took the opportunity to grow the petrochemical industry to improve economic growth. It proved a success when the petroleum industry took off in the 1970s.

By the 1980s, after a decade of rapid industrialisation, industrial land was growing scarce on Singapore mainland. The idea of joining the southern islands off Jurong to form one colossal island to create more industrial land was therefore conceived.

In 1991, JTC Corporation (formerly Jurong Town Corporation) was appointed the agent of the Jurong Island project. JTC planned and coordinated with various government agencies in providing the necessary infrastructure and services to the island.

Physical land reclamation began in 1995, and Jurong Island was officially opened on 14 October 2000 by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. From the 9.91 km2 land area of the original seven islets, as of completion of the land reclamation on 25 September 2009, Jurong Island currently has a total land area of 30 km2. Penta-Ocean Construction was the major contractor and reclamation was completed 20 years ahead of schedule.

==Petrochemical industries==
Today, Jurong Island is home to many companies such as Arkema, Arlanxeo, Afton Chemical, Air Liquide, Asahi Kasei, BASF, Celanese, Evonik, ExxonMobil, Infineum, DuPont, Mitsui Chemicals, Chevron Oronite, Linde, Mitsubishi Chemicals, SLNG, Shell, Singapore Petroleum Company Singapore Refining Company, Stepan Company, Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore, The Polyolefin Company, Chevron Phillips, Mitsui Elastomer, Baker Hughes and Sumitomo Chemical.
Clusters of gigantic cylindrical tanks amid a maze of pipelines now dot the island; investment totalled S$31 billion in 2010. Resident companies produce a vast range of items, from petroleum products to polycarbonate resins used in CDs, DVDs and LCD TV panels, and super-absorbent polymers that go into diapers and sanitary napkins.
ExxonMobil, which has invested S$4 billion in a refinery and cracker plant, makes industrial and automotive lubricants including a product used in Formula One racing cars. DuPont has invested S$1 billion, and manufactures Zytel nylon resin, a versatile engineering plastic used in automobile components, appliances, wire insulation, sporting gear and home furnishings. Afton Chemical is constructing a new manufacturing facility, expected to become operational in January 2016, to produce petroleum additives for the Asia-Pacific and Middle East markets.
Output for the chemicals cluster—which cover oil and gas, petrochemicals and speciality chemicals—totalled S$66.5 billion in 2005, an increase of 31 per cent from 2004. This accounted for almost 32 per cent of production in Singapore&#x27;s manufacturing sector. Powered by the cluster, Singapore is currently one of the world&#x27;s top three oil refining centres despite not having a single drop of crude deposits.
Jurong Island&#x27;s refineries process of crude oil per day, turning it into petrol, kerosene and jet fuel sold locally and abroad. Cracker plants break down the molecules of other oil-and gas-related substances such as naphtha into additives that give unique characteristics to certain products, from printer inks to plastic mouldings, semiconductors and aircraft materials.
Apart from imported crude, natural gas from Indonesia&#x27;s West Natuna field arrives at Jurong Island via a 640 km undersea pipeline. Some of it is refined to provide a source of cleaner and cheaper fuel, while the rest is sent to crackers that make other petrochemical products. The country&#x27;s first refilling station for compressed natural gas (CNG) opened on Jurong Island in 2002. As most of the 2500+ cars running on CNG in Singapore are not allowed to enter the island because the drivers do not have the necessary security pass, four more CNG stations opened on the main island leading up to September 2009.


==Security==
Jurong Island was gazetted as a Protected Place in October 2001 following the September 11 attacks in the United States. Access control is contracted to a private security company, while the Singapore Army helps to protect the island. The Police Coast Guard also conducts regular patrols around the island to ensure no unauthorised vessels are allowed access within a restricted area of waters surrounding it.

Access to the island is limited to staff and visitors, and they are issued with security passes. Other security restrictions include that any photographic equipment brought to the island must be declared. Without permission from Island Security it is forbidden to take photographs or videos on Jurong Island. Anyone getting caught taking pictures or videos is handed over to the police, and subsequently will have their Jurong Island pass confiscated and their permission to enter Jurong Island revoked.

Jurong Island and the southwestern waters were to be used for Exercise Northstar 8 from 21 to 25 November 2011. However, Exercise Northstar 8 was only carried out on 25 November 2011 after 4pm at Jurong Island, up to 7.30pm.

==Infrastructure==
Jurong Island has two fire stations, and an amenity centre known as &quot;Oasis@Sakra&quot; that houses a food court, a medical clinic and a free-of-charge multi-storey carpark. The island also houses the Pulau Seraya Power Station, Singapore&#x27;s first offshore power station, which was built in phases on the former Pulau Seraya since 1986. A 200 MW / 285 MWh lithium iron phosphate grid battery started in early 2023.

The island has a network of pipelines that allows for seamless integration among companies. For example, Japan&#x27;s Teijin can make polycarbonates from chlorine piped in directly from CIFE and bisphenol A from Mitsui Chemicals elsewhere on the island. Red pipes carry water for firefighting, and green pipes carry sea water for cooling. Huge silver pipes carry steam, and small silver pipes bring product lines.

There are two major cargo jetties on Jurong Island, namely Sakra Jetty and Banyan Jetty. Sakra Jetty is managed and controlled by ExxonMobil.

Jurong Island is linked to the main island by a 2.3 km causeway known as the Jurong Island Highway, opened in March 1999, build by Hyundai Construction. Several public bus services run between Jurong Island and the mainland, operated by Woodlands Transport.

==Jurong Rock Caverns==

Construction work on Jurong Rock Caverns (JRC), Singapore&#x27;s first underground rock caverns for storage of crude oil, condensates, naphtha and gas-oil, started on 8 February 2007. JTC Corporation has been appointed by the Singapore government to undertake the construction of JRC.

Located beneath the seabed of Banyan Basin, off Jurong Island, JRC was completed in phases beginning in 2013, and was officially opened on 2 September 2014. As a result of this first phase of work, the caverns reportedly have a storage capacity of 1.47 million cubic metres. Phase 2, which has the potential to add another 1.32 million cubic metres, is being explored.

==Plans==
To raise its competitive edge, Singapore is moving to produce higher-value-added speciality products, including chemicals that would go into animal vaccines, animal feeds, consumer care items such as cosmetics and industrial enzymes to support the biomedical sector. As part of this effort to move up the value chain, the Institute of Chemical and Engineering Science (an A*STAR research institute) has been set up on Jurong Island.

There have also been plans to build a second causeway to link the Western end of Jurong Island Highway with Gul Road in Jurong Industrial Estate on mainland Singapore, but these have been shelved. The investment earmarked for the second causeway has been re-allocated to the building of HDB flats at Western Water Catchment later in the decade.

<text>Franz Karl Achard (28 April 1753 – 20 April 1821) was a German (Prussian) chemist, geoscientist, physicist, and biologist. His principal discovery was the production of sugar from sugar beets.

== Life and work ==
Achard was born in Berlin, the son of preacher Max Guillaume Achard, a descendant of Huguenot refugees, and his wife Marguerite Elisabeth (Rouppert). He studied physics and chemistry in Berlin. He became interested in sugar refining through his stepfather. At the age of 20, Achard entered the &quot;Circle of Friends of Natural Sciences&quot; and met Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, then director of the physical classes at the Royal Academy of Sciences. Achard studied many subjects, including meteorology, evaporation chillness, electricity, telegraphy, gravity, lightning arresters, and published in German and French.

Achard was a favourite of King Frederick II of Prussia, and directly reported to the King on his research twice a week. About a study on the influence of electricity on mental capabilities, Frederick II was reported to have said: &quot;If he is able to provide reason for the half-wits in my Prussian states using electricity, then he is worth more than his own weight in gold.&quot;

In 1776 Achard was elected to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin. In 1778, Achard was elected as member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. Following the death of Marggraf in 1782, Archard went on to become the director of the physical classes of the academy. In 1782 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

For his discoveries in the acclimatisation of tobacco to Germany, the king granted him a lifetime pension of 500 taler. Achard was also esteemed by Frederick William II of Prussia.
===Sugar===
Achard revived the discovery by Marggraf in 1747 that sugar beets contained sugar, and devised a process to produce sugar from sugar beets. Beginning in 1789, he planted various sugar-bearing plants on his manor in Kaulsdorf near Berlin. He soon preferred sugar beets because of their efficiency. In the following year he studied different varieties of beets and the influence of fertilisers. The research was interrupted when Kaulsdorf manor burnt down and had to be sold. Achard later continued on the manor Französisch Buchholz. This would in turn lead to a reduced need for slaves in sugar-production, and the subsequent abolishment of slavery in much of the world. 

In 1801, with the support of King Friedrich Wilhelm III, he opened the first sugar beet refinery at Gut Kunern near Steinau Silesia, Prussia. In 1802, the refinery processed 400 tons of beets with a degree of efficiency of 4%. Other refineries were soon built by his students Johann Gottlob Nathusius and Moritz, Freiherr von Koppy. In 1807 Achard&#x27;s plant was burned down during the Napoleonic Wars and in 1810 it was rebuilt on a small scale. Embargoes by Napoleon kept cane sugar imports away from Germany and thus the growing and refining of sugar beets became highly important for the Prussian government. Refineries also appeared in Bohemia, Augsburg and in 1811 in France. France itself built many refineries and was only in later years surpassed by Prussia.

English sugar merchants offered Achard 200,000 taler to declare his experiments a failure but he refused. With Achard&#x27;s discovery, sugar was no longer a luxury product, but local production became a necessity, due to the embargoes. Achard taught classes to have a large number of sugar beet growers and the specially developed sugar beets became available for everyone. Achard described the sugar beet as, &quot;one of the most bountiful gifts which the devine munificence had awarded to man on earth.&quot;

In 1794, Achard built an optical telegraph between Spandau and Bellevue. This device had been invented just one year before by Claude Chappe.

Due to Archard&#x27;s financial difficulties as a result of several fires in 1807, his refineries were declared bankrupt in 1815. He died, destitute, in 1821 in Wohlau. His life&#x27;s work was carried on mainly by French industrialists such as at the refineries of Matthias Christian Rabbethge. In mid 19th century America, Achard&#x27;s grandson Anton William Waldemar Achard successfully promoted beet sugar production in Michigan according to a later descendant, Emil Lockwood, son of Mabel Pauline Achard.

<text>Mathilde Marie Christine Ghislaine d&#x27;Udekem d&#x27;Acoz (; born 20 January 1973) is Queen of the Belgians as the wife of King Philippe. She is the first native-born Belgian queen, and has four children. She formerly worked as a speech therapist. She is involved with a range of organisations which address social issues including education, child poverty, intergenerational poverty, the position of women in society and literacy.

==Early life and family==
&quot;Jonkvrouw&quot; Mathilde Marie Christine Ghislaine d&#x27;Udekem d&#x27;Acoz was born on 20 January 1973 at Edith Cavell Hospital in Uccle, Brussels, Belgium. Her parents are Count Patrick d&#x27;Udekem d&#x27;Acoz (1936–2008), a politician, and his wife, Countess Anna Maria Komorowska (b. 1946). Mathilde has three sisters: Marie-Alix (1974–1997), Elisabeth (b. 1977, a speech therapist) and Hélène (b. 1979, a lawyer), and one brother Charles-Henri (b. 1985, a lawyer). Her godfather is her uncle, Count Raoul d&#x27;Udekem d&#x27;Acoz.

Mathilde grew up in the Château de Losange in . At the age of 17, she lived with her three sisters in an apartment at , Schaarbeek.

==Education and career==
Mathilde attended primary school in Bastogne and then attended secondary school at the Institut de la Vierge Fidèle in Brussels. At the age of 18, Mathilde did voluntary work in the slums of Cairo for six weeks. From 1991 until 1994, Mathilde attended the Institut Libre Marie Haps in Brussels, where she studied speech therapy and graduated magna cum laude. She worked as a speech therapist in her own practice in Brussels from 1995 to 1999. She also worked in several Brussels schools. She earned a master&#x27;s degree in psychology at the Université catholique de Louvain in 2002 with honours (cum laude). Mathilde became the first member of the Belgian royal family with a Belgian university degree. She also took a ten-day leadership course at Harvard University in 2011.

Mathilde speaks French, Dutch, English and Italian. She is also able to speak basic Spanish. Her mother, who has lived most of her life outside Poland, did not teach her Polish, thinking that it would not be necessary. Therefore, she knows only a few words of Polish.

==Marriage and children==

&quot;Jonkvrouw&quot; Mathilde d&#x27;Udekem d&#x27;Acoz met Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant while playing tennis in 1996. In September 1999, the Belgian Royal Court announced the engagement of Prince Philippe to Mathilde. Mathilde was presented to the press and public at the Castle of Laeken on 13 September 1999. The announcement of Mathilde&#x27;s engagement to the Belgian heir-apparent Prince Philippe came as a surprise to the country. Mathilde married Philippe on 4 December 1999 in Brussels, civilly at the Brussels Town Hall and religiously at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula. Mathilde&#x27;s bridal gown was designed by Édouard Vermeulen. She was made Duchess of Brabant and a Princess of Belgium on 8 November 1999 (published on 13 November 1999 and effective from 4 December 1999). The couple reportedly spent their honeymoon in the Maldives and India.

Upon her marriage to Prince Philippe in 1999, King Albert II of Belgium elevated the d&#x27;Udekem d&#x27;Acoz family from the baronial to the comital rank, hereditary in the male lineage.

The couple have four children:
*Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant, born 25 October 2001 at Erasmus Hospital in Anderlecht, Brussels
*Prince Gabriel, born 20 August 2003 at Erasmus Hospital in Anderlecht, Brussels
*Prince Emmanuel, born 4 October 2005 at Erasmus Hospital in Anderlecht, Brussels
*Princess Eléonore, born 16 April 2008 at Erasmus Hospital in Anderlecht, Brussels

Princess Elisabeth, the couple&#x27;s eldest child, is the first in line to the throne and ahead of her younger brothers and sister, who are second, third, and fourth in line to succeed, owing to a change in Belgian succession laws in 1991, allowing for the eldest child to succeed, regardless of sex.

Queen Mathilde is a godmother to Princess Alexia of the Netherlands and Princess Isabella of Denmark. Queen Mathilde is also a godmother to girls named Hyle-Mathilde Blakaj, Zaineb Tebbi and Madinah Mohammed Ibrahim, the seventh daughters of families from Charleroi and Ghent. Belgian tradition stated that the seventh daughter from an uninterrupted line of girls has the privilege of asking the Queen to be her godmother.

==Queen Consort==
King Albert II announced on 3 July 2013 that he would abdicate in favour of Philippe on 21 July 2013. Approximately one hour after King Albert II&#x27;s abdication, Prince Philippe was sworn in as King of the Belgians. Upon his accession, Mathilde became the first queen consort of native Belgian nationality. (An earlier Belgian king, King Leopold III, had a Belgian second wife, Lilian, Princess of Réthy, who was not given the title of queen). Their eldest child, Princess Elisabeth, became heir apparent and is expected to become Belgium&#x27;s first queen regnant.

==Activities==
Queen Mathilde is involved with a range of social issues including education, child poverty, intergenerational poverty, the position of women in society and literacy.

Since 2009, Queen Mathilde has been the honorary president of Unicef Belgium. She serves as the World Health Organization&#x27;s Special Representative for immunization. She also the honorary president of the Breast International Group, a non-profit organisation for academic breast cancer research groups from around the world.

She set up the Princess Mathilde Fund (now the Queen Mathilde Fund) in 2001, which promotes the care of vulnerable people and awards an annual prize for good works in a particular sector. The sector changes each year: examples include early years education, women&#x27;s health, and protecting young people from violence.

Queen Mathilde deploys the Queen&#x27;s Charities to offer help to citizens who are struggling to cope with financial hardship in their daily lives and often turn to her as a last resort. The Queen is the honorary president of Child Focus, a foundation for missing and sexually exploited children.

Queen Mathilde is also a patron of the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition, an international competition founded in 1937 as an initiative of Queen Elisabeth and Belgian composer and violist Eugène Ysaÿe.

In 2018, Queen Mathilde became the honorary president of the Federal Council for Sustainable Development. According to the royal tradition, Queen Mathilde became an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Medicine of Belgium.

Queen Mathilde is a member of the board of the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship. She was a United Nations Emissary for the International Year of Microcredit 2005, which focused in particular on financial inclusion and financial literacy. The Queen also attends the annual World Economic Forum in Davos.

Queen Mathilde was named a &quot;United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Advocate&quot; in 2016, promoting the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (an agenda for global sustainable development).

The Queen also presided at the ceremony awarding the King Baudouin International Development Prize. She also received an Honorary Doctorate from Hasselt University on 30 May 2023.

<doc id="287790" wikidata="Q14670" url="?curid=287790" title="Filesystem Hierarchy Standard">
<text>The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is a reference describing the conventions used for the layout of Unix-like systems. It has been made popular by its use in Linux distributions, but it is used by other Unix-like systems as well. It is maintained by the Linux Foundation. The latest version is 3.0, released on 3 June 2015.

==Directory structure==

In the FHS, all files and directories appear under the root directory codice_1, even if they are stored on different physical or virtual devices. Some of these directories only exist in a particular system if certain subsystems, such as the X Window System, are installed.

Most of these directories exist in all Unix-like operating systems and are generally used in much the same way; however, the descriptions here are those used specifically for the FHS and are not considered authoritative for platforms other than Linux.

== FHS compliance ==
Most Linux distributions follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard and declare it their own policy to maintain FHS compliance. GoboLinux and NixOS provide examples of intentionally non-compliant filesystem implementations.

Some distributions generally follow the standard but deviate from it in some areas. The FHS is a &quot;trailing standard&quot;, and so documents common practices at a point in time. Of course, times change, and distribution goals and needs call for experimentation. Some common deviations include:
* Modern Linux distributions include a codice_2 directory as a virtual filesystem (sysfs, comparable to codice_3, which is a procfs), which stores and allows modification of the devices connected to the system, whereas many traditional Unix-like operating systems use codice_2 as a symbolic link to the kernel source tree.
* Many modern Unix-like systems (such as FreeBSD and OpenBSD) via their ports systems install third-party packages into codice_5, while keeping code considered part of the operating system in codice_6.
* Some Linux distributions no longer differentiate between codice_7 and codice_8 and have codice_7 symlinked to codice_8.
* Some Linux distributions no longer differentiate between codice_11 and codice_12 and between codice_13 and codice_14. They may symlink codice_11 to codice_12 and codice_13 to codice_14. Other distributions choose to consolidate all four, symlinking them to codice_12.

Modern Linux distributions include a codice_20 directory as a temporary filesystem (tmpfs), which stores volatile runtime data, following the FHS version 3.0. According to the FHS version 2.3, such data were stored in codice_21, but this was a problem in some cases because this directory is not always available at early boot. As a result, these programs have had to resort to trickery, such as using codice_22, codice_23, codice_24 or codice_25 directories, even though the device directory is not intended for such data. Among other advantages, this makes the system easier to use normally with the root filesystem mounted read-only.
For example, below are the changes Debian made in its 2013 Wheezy release:
* codice_26 → codice_27
* codice_28 → codice_29
* codice_30 → codice_27
* codice_32 (writeable files) → codice_33
* codice_34 → codice_20
* codice_36 → codice_37
* codice_21 → codice_20
* codice_40 → codice_41

== History ==

=== The name of codice_42 ===
codice_6 originally stood for &quot;user&quot;. This was an artifact of early Unix programming. Specifically, when Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie were migrating Unix to a PDP-11, the contents of the codice_11 and codice_7 directories, which were to be the first directories mounted on startup and to contain all essentials for the OS to function, became too large to fit on an RK05 disk drive. So they put some of those files on a second RK05, making sure that the first drive contained everything required for loading the second one. The rest of the files were put into the codice_6 directory. When they got a third drive, users&#x27; files were moved to a new directory named codice_47.

FHS was created as the FSSTND (short for &quot;Filesystem Standard&quot;), largely based on similar standards for other Unix-like operating systems. Notable examples are these: the description of file system layout, which has existed since the release of Version 7 Unix (in 1979); the SunOS and its successor, the Solaris .

<text>Poḷonnaruwa, (; ) also referred as Pulathisipura and Vijayarajapura in ancient times, is the main town of Polonnaruwa District in North Central Province, Sri Lanka. The modern town of Polonnaruwa is also known as New Town, and the other part of Polonnaruwa remains as the royal ancient city of the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa.

The second-oldest of all Sri Lanka&#x27;s kingdoms, Polonnaruwa was first established as a military post by the Sinhalese kingdom. It was renamed Jananathamangalam by the Chola dynasty after their successful invasion of the country&#x27;s then capital, Anuradhapura, in the 10th century. The &quot;Ancient City of Polonnaruwa&quot; has been declared a World Heritage Site.

Modern Polonnaruwa is undergoing a major development project known as the &quot;Awakening of Polonnaruwa,&quot; championed by former President Maithripala Sirisena. It envisions the development of all sectors in Polonnaruwa including roads, electricity, agriculture, education, health and environment.

== Etymology ==
The name Polonnaruwa is of unknown origin. Its Tamil form, &quot;Pulainari&quot;, is mentioned in Tamil inscriptions of the Chola dynasty found at Polonnaruwa. The name was perhaps a contraction of its ancient name &quot;Pulastya nagara&quot; or &quot;Pulatti nakaram&quot; meaning city of the Hindu sage Pulastya.

It was renamed under Chola rule as &quot;Jananathapuram&quot; or &quot;Jananathamangalam&quot;. The place was later known as &quot;Vijayarajapuram&quot; as mentioned in the records of Jayabahu I, which probably was derived from the name of Vijayabahu I.

== Demographic == 
Polonnaruwa has a Sinhalese majority. Muslims form the second largest group. There are also small numbers of Sri Lankan Tamils and Indian Tamils. Others include Burgher and Malay.

==History==
Polonnaruwa was first established as a military post by the Sinhalese kingdom. And, it was renamed Jananathamangalam by the Chola dynasty after their successful invasion of the country in the 10th century. Raja Raja Chola I built &quot;Vanavan Mahadevisvaram,&quot; a Shiva temple at Polonnaruwa named after his queen, which presently is known as &quot;Siva Devale&quot;. The temple among other contained Ganesha and Parvati statues of bronze. north and central parts of Sri Lanka was under this period ruled under Rajendra Chola I directly as a Chola province. However, following the year 1070 AD ended the Chola rule in the island, and Polonnaruwa was captured by Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa also known as Vijayabahu the great.

Starting from Mahanagakula on the south of the Walawe river, Vijayabahu dispatched three armies to attack Polonnaruwa from three fronts. One army was sent along the western shore of the country to the port of Mahathittha to deal with any reinforcements arriving from South India. Afterwards, part of this army moved towards Polonnaruwa and attacked from the northwest. A second army was sent from the east across Magama to attack Polonnaruwa from the east. The third and main force advanced across the country, led by the king. Surrounded by these three armies, Polonnaruwa was besieged for seven months before king Vijayabahu&#x27;s forces entered the city. In 1070, Vijayabahu became the ruler of Polonnaruwa. At that time Sri Lanka was known as Thambapanni.

Trade and agriculture flourished under the patronage of the famous grandson of King Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa, king Prakramabahu the Great, who was so adamant that no drop of water falling from the heavens was to be wasted and each was to be used toward the development of the land. Hence, irrigation systems that are far superior to those of the Anuradhapura Age were constructed during Parakramabahu&#x27;s reign – systems which to this day supply the water necessary for paddy cultivation during the scorching dry season in the east of the country. The greatest of these systems is the Parakrama Samudra or the Sea of Parakrama which was also used as a large sea-going ship anchorage via the Mahaweli River. The Kingdom of Polonnaruwa was completely self-sufficient during King Parakramabahu&#x27;s reign.

With the exception of his immediate successor, Nissankamalla I, the other monarchs of Polonnaruwa were not as strong-willed and were prone to picking fights within their own court. They also went on to form more matrimonial alliances with stronger South Indian kingdoms until these matrimonial links superseded the local royal lineage. This prompted an invasion by the Aryacakravarti dynasty warlord Kalinga Magha in 1214, which saw the complete destruction of the metropolises of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa by burning.

==Present day==

Today the ancient city of Polonnaruwa remains one of the best-planned archaeological relic cities in the country, standing testimony to the discipline and greatness of the Kingdom&#x27;s first rulers. Its beauty was also used as a backdrop to film scenes for the Duran Duran music video &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; in 1982. The ancient city of Polonnaruwa has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

Near the ancient city, there is a small town with several hotels and some glossy shops, and places to fulfil day-to-day needs. There are government institutions in a newly built area called “New Town,” about 6 km away from the town and the main road. The largest school in the district, Polonnaruwa Royal Central College is situated in the new town.

Polonnaruwa is the second largest city in North Central Province, but it is known as one of the cleanest and more beautiful cities in the country. The green environment, amazing ancient constructions, Parakrama Samudra (a huge lake built in 1200), and attractive tourist hotels and hospitable people, make it a tourism hotspot.

Another draw for tourists is the city&#x27;s population of toque macaques. The monkeys have been living in the ruins since the human occupation and continued to thrive there long after the humans left.

<text>DBS Bank Limited is a Singaporean multinational banking and financial services corporation headquartered at the Marina Bay Financial Centre in the Marina Bay district of Singapore. The bank was previously known as The Development Bank of Singapore Limited, which &quot;DBS&quot; was derived from, before the present abbreviated name was adopted on 21 July 2003 to reflect its role as a global bank. It is one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; local banks in Singapore, along with Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) and United Overseas Bank (UOB).

DBS is the largest bank in Southeast Asia by assets and among the largest banks in Asia, with assets totaling S$739 billion It also holds market-dominant positions in consumer banking, treasury and markets, securities brokerage, equity and debt fund-raising in other regions aside from Singapore, including in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Indonesia.

According to Asian Private Banker magazine in 2023, DBS replaced Credit Suisse as the third-largest private bank in Asia, excluding onshore China, with approximately US$201 billion (S$271 billion) assets under management.

==Overview==
Listed on the Singapore Exchange, DBS was officially incorporated by the Government of Singapore on 16 July 1968 to take over the industrial financing responsibilities of the Economic Development Board (EDB).

DBS&#x27;s largest and controlling shareholder is Temasek Holdings, Singapore&#x27;s second-largest sovereign wealth fund after GIC. Temasek owns 29% of DBS shares. The bank&#x27;s reliable capital position has garnered a &quot;AA−&quot; and &quot;Aa1&quot; credit ratings by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s and Moody&#x27;s, which are among the highest in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as earning the Global Finance&#x27;s &quot;Safest Bank in Asia&quot; accolade for fifteen consecutive years, from 2009 to 2023. The Bank was also awarded the Best Digital Bank in the World in 2016 by Euromoney. In July 2019, DBS became the first bank in the world to concurrently hold three of the most prestigious global best bank honours from Euromoney, Global Finance and The Banker.

DBS has been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index since 2 October 2018, making it the first bank in Southeast Asia to do so. DBS was one of the first companies in Singapore to be recognised for gender equality efforts along with City Developments Limited in the first Bloomberg L.P. Gender-Equality Index (GEI) that was published in 2018.

==History==
The Development Bank of Singapore Limited was established on 16 July 1968 by the Singapore government to take over the industrial financing responsibilities of the Economic Development Board (EDB) and began operations on 1 September 1968. The bank&#x27;s main function upon its establishment was to finance Singapore’s industrialisation and the government’s urban development projects. Back in 1960, the government invited a United Nations (UN) industrial survey mission to assess the economic situation in Singapore and to come up with an industrialization programme for the city. The proposal included setting up a development bank, together with an economic body to attract foreign investments to Singapore and also provide industrial financing and management of industrial estates.

In April 1968, then Minister for Finance, Goh Keng Swee revealed the government’s plans to form a development bank with equity participation from the public in order to have greater financing for Singapore’s industrialisation project. The establishment of the DBS marked the first time the private sector was allowed to fully participate in the financing of manufacturing and other industrial projects in Singapore. With a startup capital of S$100 million, share ownership in its first year of operations comprised the following: S$48.6 million by the Singapore government; S$25.9 million by commercial banks; S$7.6 million by insurance companies and other financial institutions; and S$17.9 million by other companies and members of the public.

DBS launched its trademark logo in 1972. Set against a white backdrop, the mark consisted of a cluster of four inward-pointing red arrows shaped after the caissons of its former headquarters – DBS Building on Shenton Way.

===Acquisition of POSB Bank===

Formerly known as Post Office Savings Bank, it was established on 1 January 1877 at the General Post Office Building in Raffles Place by the Straits Settlements government.

By 1976, POSB had one million depositors, while deposits crossed the S$1 billion mark. The bank was then renamed POSBank in 1990, before being acquired by DBS Bank on 16 November 1998 for S$1.6 billion (first announced on 24 July 1998), giving it a dominant market share with over four million customers. The merger was seen to enable POSB to compete better with full-fledged commercial banks, to better serve more sophisticated customers, and in line with the government&#x27;s call for local banks to merge and create larger and stronger banks to compete internationally.

POSB Bank still operates one of the highest numbers of bank branches in Singapore, especially in the heartlands, and operates the highest number of ATM outlets throughout the country. The integration of both banks allowed customers of either bank to share the facilities; DBS Bank depositors may use the Cash Deposit Machine installed islandwide in POSBank branches, likewise for POSB Bank depositors.

===The Islamic Bank of Asia (2007 – 2015)===

DBS Bank launched The Islamic Bank of Asia (IB Asia) on 7 May 2007, after receiving official approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for a full bank licence. IB Asia&#x27;s founding shareholders include majority stakeholder DBS and 34 Middle Eastern investors from prominent families and industrial groups from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.

On 14 September 2015, DBS Bank announced that it will progressively cease IB Asia as it was not able to achieve economies of scale when operated as a single entity. The process was estimated to &quot;take&quot; about 2 to 3 years. DBS stated that it would be developing its own Islamic compliant banking products instead.

===DBS iB Secure Device and Internet banking (2006 – present)===
Starting in late 2006, the bank began releasing to its Internet banking customers a Dual Factor Authentication device to assist in thwarting phishing attacks. The DBS iB Secure Device is a hardware device with a key fob form factor that generates a password that is linked to the log-on name. The password changes every sixty seconds and once used is no longer valid. The institution Code for DBS is 7171.

In 2012, DBS introduced a New Generation IB Secure Device as part of the financial industry-wide initiative for an even safer online banking experience. The device has stronger authentication capabilities and provides users with an extra layer of security against potential fraudulent activities and threats.

DBS had a total of 2.4 million Internet banking users in Singapore as of 2013.

===Digital banking (2010 – present)===
On 15 April 2010, DBS Bank launched digibank to both DBS and POSB customers. It allows customers to view their banking and credit card accounts, transfer funds and pay bills via their mobile phones.

Customers using digibank will be protected by DBS Bank&#x27;s &#x27;money-safe&#x27; guarantee. The bank promised reimbursements if were are any unauthorised transactions.

As of 2013, there were 839,000 digibank users in Singapore.

In 2014, DBS released its mobile wallet service named PayLah!, which garnered more than 100,000 users less than two months after its launch in Singapore. As of 2018, PayLah! had more than 1 million users.

In 2014, CEO Piyush Gupta and his leadership team launched a digital transformation programme intended to &quot;Make Banking Joyful&quot;. Under this programme, the bank would consider itself &quot;a technology company delivering banking services&quot; and benchmark its progress against leading technology companies and aim to be the &quot;D&quot; in the acronym GANDALF, alongside Google, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, LinkedIn, and Facebook.

In 2016 and 2018, the Euromoney magazine named DBS the world&#x27;s best digital bank and the world&#x27;s best small and medium-size enterprise bank.

===Digital banking disruptions (2023)===
On 29 March 2023, DBS experienced a service outage that prevented users from using its digital banking services, including its mobile app and PayLah! app, from about 8.30am until about 5.45pm. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) stated that the disruption was &quot;unacceptable&quot; and that the bank had fallen short of MAS&#x27;s expectations that the bank would maintain &quot;high system availability and ensure its IT systems are recovered expeditiously&quot;. The regulator stated that it would &quot;take the commensurate supervisory actions against DBS after gathering the necessary facts&quot;. At the bank&#x27;s annual general meeting held on 31 March 2023, CEO Piyush Gupta apologised for the service outage that had occurred earlier in the month. Chairman Peter Seah announced that a special board committee had been set up to investigate the incident and that external experts would be brought in to assist the bank.

On 5 May 2023, DBS&#x27;s online banking and payment services, as well as its ATM services, were disrupted from about noon until about 3.10pm. The disruption affected the bank&#x27;s PayLah! service as well as the &#x27;paywave&#x27; feature on credit and debit cards. Following the incident, the MAS imposed additional capital requirements on DBS, requiring it to apply a multiplier of 1.8 times to its risk-weighted assets for operational risk, such that its total additional regulatory capital would need to amount to approximately S$1.6 billion. On 14 October 2023, DBS suffered a service disruption that affected its digital banking services, including its online banking and payment services as well as its ATM services. The disruption lasted from began from 3pm and lasted for at least several hours. At 10.10pm, DBS announced that all ATMs were back up and running, although some digital services, such as digital banking and its PayLah! service continued to be disrupted.

On 1 November 2023, in response to the incidents, the MAS imposed restrictions on DBS: prohibiting it from acquiring any new business ventures and requiring it to pause all non-essential IT changes for 6 months. DBS was also prohibited from reducing the size of its branch and ATM networks in Singapore. CEO Piyush Gupta apologised for the disruption and stated that the bank will set aside a special budget of S$80 million to enhance system resiliency. According to CEO Piyush Gupta, four out of five of the bank&#x27;s major disruptions in 2023 were related to software bugs, and further that &quot;in at least two or three of these incidents, the bug was so deep that we wouldn&#x27;t be able to pick it up&quot;. He also cited &quot;working from home&quot; as a possible cause for these software bugs and said that the bank intended to improve the depth of its engineering team. DBS has set aside a special budget of S$80 million to enhance system resiliency and hopes to have a more robust recovery process in place by the end of Q1 2024.

On 2 April 2012, DBS announced that it was planning to buy over a majority stake in Bank Danamon from Temasek Holdings. Initial reactions to the proposed purchase in Indonesia were cautious with most commentators saying that the deal was expected to be approved but that government regulators would doubtless wish to look at some of the details, including reciprocity from Singapore policy makers, quite closely before making a final decision.

On 31 July 2013, DBS announced that it had allowed the Bank Danamon bid to lapse, but that they remained committed to Indonesia and will continue to invest and grow the franchise.

==Controversies==
===1Malaysia Development Berhad fund fiasco===
In October 2016, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) imposed financial penalties amounting to S$1 million on DBS for 10 breaches of anti-money laundering requirements and control lapses in relation to Malaysia’s scandal-tainted 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) related fund flows.

===Wirecard scandal===
In June 2023, DBS was fined S$2.6 million by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) for breaching anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism requirements, in a matter related to the German payments provider Wirecard scandal between July 2015 and February 2020, in relation to the accounts of 11 corporate customers. DBS had failed to maintain relevant and up-to-date due diligence information on the customers’ beneficial ownerships, and to update their risk ratings for money laundering and terrorism financing. The bank also failed to adequately establish the source of wealth of higher-risk customers and their beneficial owners. In addition, it did not adequately inquire into the background and purpose of unusually large transactions that were not consistent with its knowledge of the customers, or had no apparent economic purpose.

===HKMA fine (2024)===
On 5 July 2024, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited was fined HK$10 million (S$1.73 million) by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) for lapses in adhering to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations. DBS Bank (Hong Kong) failed to continuously monitor business relationships and conduct enhanced due diligence in high risk situations. The bank also failed to keep records on some of its customers.

<text>The Monetary Authority of Singapore or (MAS), is the central bank and financial regulatory authority of Singapore. It administers the various statutes pertaining to money, banking, insurance, securities and the financial sector in general, as well as currency issuance and manages the foreign-exchange reserves. It was established in 1971 to act as the banker to and as a financial agent of the Government of Singapore. 
The body is duly accountable to the Parliament of Singapore through the Minister-in-charge, who is also the Incumbent Chairman of the central bank.

==History==

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) was founded in 1971 to oversee various monetary functions associated with banking and finance. Prior its establishment, monetary functions were performed by government departments and agencies. The acronym MAS resembles &quot;mas&quot;, the word for &#x27;gold&#x27; in Malay, Singapore&#x27;s national language—although the acronym is pronounced with each of its initial letters.

As Singapore progressed, an increasingly complex banking and monetary environment required more dynamic and coherent monetary administration. Therefore, in 1970, the Parliament of Singapore passed the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act leading to the formation of MAS on 1 January 1971. The act gives MAS the authority to regulate all elements of monetary policy, banking, and finance in Singapore.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, MAS brought forward its bi-annual meeting from some time in April to 30 March. The MAS decided to ease the Singapore dollar&#x27;s appreciation rate to zero percent, as well as adjust the policy band downwards, the first such move since the 2007–2008 financial crisis. This marks the first time the MAS had taken these two measures together.

Unlike many central banks around the world, the MAS is not independent from the Singapore Government—the MAS is under the purview of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (PMO); chairmen of the MAS were either former or incumbent Minister for Finance. Some includes the former Prime Ministers or the current Deputy Prime Ministers.

==List of chairmen==
==Policy==
Since 1981, monetary policy in Singapore is mainly conducted through the management of the exchange rate (rather than inflation targeting) of the Singapore dollar, in order to promote price stability as a basis for sustainable economic growth. The exchange rate is an intermediate target of monetary policy in the context of the small and open Singapore economy (where gross exports and imports of goods and services are more than 300 percent of GDP and almost 40 cents of every Singapore dollar spent domestically is on imports), the exchange rate represents a significantly stronger influence on inflation than the interest rate. As a result, the nominal exchange rate, directly and indirectly, affects a wide range of prices in the Singapore economy, such as import and export prices, wages and rentals, consumer prices and output prices.

MAS controls monetary policy through direct interventions in the foreign exchange markets and bears a stable and predictable relationship with the price stability as the final target of policy, over the medium-term. The Singapore dollar (SGD) is managed against a basket of currencies of Singapore&#x27;s major trading partners and competitors; the various currencies are assigned weights in accordance with the importance of the country to Singapore&#x27;s international trading relations (as shown below) and the composition of the basket is revised periodically to take into account any changes in trade patterns.

MAS operates a managed float regime for the Singapore dollar. The tradeweighted exchange rate, which is known as the &#x27;Singapore dollar Nominal Effective Exchange Rate&#x27; (S$NEER) is allowed to fluctuate within a policy band; the level and direction of which is announced semi-annually (typically every six months) to the market. The policy band provides a mechanism to accommodate short-term fluctuations in the foreign exchange markets and allows flexibility in managing the exchange rate.

The exchange rate policy band is periodically reviewed by MAS to ensure that the policy band remains consistent with underlying fundamentals of the economy; the path of the exchange rate is continually assessed every 6 months in order to prevent a misalignment in the currency value. A Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) is released by MAS after each review, which provides information on the recent movements of the exchange rate and explaining the forward guidance of future exchange rate policy. MAS would also release an accompanying report, the Macroeconomic Review (MR), which provides detailed information on the assessment of macroeconomic developments and trends in the Singapore economy; the MR is aimed to enhance market and public understanding of the monetary policy stance.

As the MAS utilises the choice of the exchange rate as the intermediate target of monetary policy, this implies that MAS does not have any control over domestic interest rates (and money supply), due to the commonly accepted concept in international economics known as the policy trilemma. In the context of free capital movements, interest rates in Singapore are largely determined by foreign interest rates and investor expectations of the future movements in the Singapore dollar. Singapore domestic interest rates have typically been below U.S. Fed funds interest rates and reflect market expectations of a trend appreciation of the Singapore dollar over time.

The exchange rate has emerged as an effective anti-inflation tool for the Singapore economy. In the twenty years since the exchange rate framework was in place, domestic inflation was relatively low, averaging 1.9% per annum from 1981 to 2010. As a result of the long record of low inflation, expectations of price stability in Singapore have become more entrenched over the years. The exchange rate system has also functioned to mitigate the adverse effects of short-term volatility on the real economy, while at the same time ensuring that the exchange rate remains aligned with economic conditions and fundamentals. The success of the exchange rate system is heavily dependent on the economic fundamentals of Singapore, such as prudent fiscal policy, flexible product and factor markets, sound financial system, and robust domestic corporate sector.

===Debt===
Singapore&#x27;s debts are under the responsibility of MAS. As of 2022, the Singapore Government debt exceeds the country&#x27;s GDP at about 150%. However, these are not net debts, but gross external debts, which can be traced to the debt liabilities in Singapore&#x27;s banking sector—a reflection of the country&#x27;s stature as a major global financial hub. In essence, Singapore borrows to invest, not to spend. Therefore, unlike other countries, Singapore is a net creditor with no debt to anyone, and has a net debt-to-GDP ratio of 0%, maintained for almost three decades since 1995.

Accordingly, Singapore is the only country in Asia with a AAA sovereign credit rating from all major rating agencies. For multiple years, Singapore emerged as the top country in the world with the least-risky credit rating under the Euromoney Country Risk (ECR) rankings, being one of the safest investment destinations. The country was also ranked as the freest economy in the world on the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; rankings.

==Major trading partners of Singapore==
==Issuing banknotes and coins==
Following its merger with the Board of Commissioners of Currency on 1 October 2002, the MAS assumed the function of currency issuance.

MAS has the exclusive right to issue banknotes and coins in Singapore. Their dimensions, designs and denominations are determined by the Monetary Policy Committee with Government approval. The banknotes and coins issued have the status of legal tender within the country for all transactions, both public and private, without limitation.

In December 2020, MAS approved digital bank licenses for 4 tech giants, Grab–Singtel consortium, Ant Group, Sea Group, and Greenland Financial consortium. Grab-Singtel and Sea Group were awarded digital full banking licenses, while Ant Group and Greenland Financial were awarded digital wholesale banking licenses. In May 2021, the ability to transfer money between Singapore&#x27;s PayNow and Thailand&#x27;s PromptPay was announced.

==Strategic initiatives==
===ASEAN Financial Innovation Network===
ASEAN Financial Innovation Network (AFIN) is a non-profit organisation, established by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), ASEAN Bankers Association (ABA), and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group in 2018. AFIN launched the Application Programming Interface Exchange (APIX), a global fintech marketplace and regulatory sandbox in 2018.

===Asian Institute of Digital Finance===

The Asian Institute of Digital Finance (AIDF) is a research institute to enhance education, research and entrepreneurship in digital finance. AIDF is a collaboration between the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the National Research Foundation and the National University of Singapore (NUS) and was established in 2021.

=== Global Finance &amp; Technology Network (GFTN) ===
Global Finance &amp; Technology Network (GFTN) is created by Monetary Authority of Singapore to serve expanding Singapore&#x27;s fintech ecosystem globally. Ravi Menon, former managing director of the MAS is appointed as the chairman of GFTN.

GFTN replaces and builds upon Elevandi, the non-profit organisation created by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in August 2021 to foster an active and open dialogue between the public and private sectors, to advance FinTech further in the global digital economy.

GFTN will continue to operate as a not-for-profit, and will work with the MAS on industry and policy dialogues in the area of payments, asset tokenization, AI and quantum.

=== Project Nexus ===
The Bank for International Settlements signed an agreement with Central Bank of Malaysia, Bank of Thailand, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Reserve Bank of India on 30 June 2024 as founding member of Project Nexus, a multilateral international initiative to enable retail cross-border payments. Bank Indonesia involved as a special observer. The platform, which is expected to go live by 2026, will interlink domestic fast payment systems of the member countries.

===Singapore FinTech Festival===
Singapore FinTech Festival (SFF) annually organised by MAS, Elevandi in partnership with The Association of Banks in Singapore in collaboration with Constellar, to connect the various FinTech communities around the world to one another.

=== Financial institution cybersecurity ===
On 18 September 2024, in a joint statement with the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), MAS announced that banks in Singapore will progressively require customers to use SingPass face verification to verify their identities when setting up their digital tokens, so as to better protect consumers from online scams.

=== Financing Asia&#x27;s Transition Partnership ===
Financing Asia&#x27;s Transition Partnership (FAST-P), was implemented by MAS as a protocol designed to unite both private-public partnerships in the sphere of de-carbonization and climate change resilience, first unveiled to the public at COP28. At the World Climate Action Summit, Singapore&#x27;s Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security with backing from MAS first unveiled the project during opening remarks. Since then, in a demonstration of shared goals for the region, Australia&#x27;s Prime Minister Albanese allocated the first of the nation&#x27;s $2 billion SEAIFF (Southeast Asia Investment Financing Facility) investment toward the initiative in December 2024. Primary goals for FAST-P remain to promote the de-risking of perceived unstable green infrastructure ventures and to tangibly bolster previously marginally bankable projects for driving sustainable innovation, with a fund target of $5 billion USD.

Key partners in debt financing include Pentagreen Capital and its affiliates HSBC &amp; Temasek, with additional endorsements by member entities&#x27; Statements of Intent and following memorandums of understanding. Member organizations range from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) to the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) target the sectors of renewable infrastructure in energy, electric vehicles, and water/waste management in a three-pronged approach to green investments, energy transition, and clean technologies.

<doc id="287798" wikidata="Q238008" url="?curid=287798" title="Jill St. John">
<text>Jill St. John (born Jill Arlyn Oppenheim; August 19, 1940) is an American retired actress. She is best known for playing Tiffany Case, the first American Bond girl of the James Bond film franchise, in 1971&#x27;s &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;. Additional performances in film include &quot;Holiday for Lovers&quot;, &quot;The Lost World&quot;, &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot;, &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot;, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination, &quot;Who&#x27;s Minding the Store?&quot;, &quot;Honeymoon Hotel&quot;, &quot;The Liquidator&quot;, &quot;The Oscar&quot;, &quot;Tony Rome&quot;, &quot;Sitting Target&quot; and &quot;The Concrete Jungle&quot;.

On television, St. John has appeared in shows including &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, &quot;Vega$&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. During her Hollywood heyday she was almost equally famous for her high-profile social life and frequent romantic associations with other movie stars. St. John is married to actor Robert Wagner, who she met when she was 18 years old. They share credits on nearly a dozen screen and stage productions, notably the miniseries remake of &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;.

==Early life==
St. John was born Jill Arlyn Oppenheim at Queen of Angels Hospital in Los Angeles on August 19, 1940, to Edward Oppenheim, a restaurateur from Brooklyn, and his philanthropist wife Betty (née Goldberg), from Philadelphia. She has no siblings, but grew up with many cousins, her mother being one of eight surviving children and her father one of three. St. John&#x27;s parents married in 1934. Her maternal grandparents were Russian, of partial Jewish descent, while her paternal great-great-grandparents emigrated from Hessen, Germany and Amsterdam.

Raised in Encino, St. John was a member of the Michael Panaieff Children&#x27;s Ballet Company with Natalie Wood and Stefanie Powers. All three would later marry or co-star with actor Robert Wagner. When she was 13, her stage mother Betty changed Jill&#x27;s last name to the more marketable St. John.

==Career==
===Child actress===
St. John made her stage debut at age five in &quot;The Conspiracy&quot; at Geller&#x27;s Theater Workshop on January 31, 1946. She describes herself during this period as &quot;precocious. I could read really well by the age of six.&quot; St. John&#x27;s television debut came in 1948, when she joined the cast of &quot;Sandy Dreams&quot;, a musical fantasy series for children featuring Richard Beymer. In December 1949, she played Missie Cratchit in &quot;The Christmas Carol&quot;, one of the earliest filmed adaptations of Charles Dickens&#x27; classic 1843 story. Shot in kinescope, it is a rare example of a 1940s live TV broadcast still surviving in entirety.

By the age of 10, St. John was a regular on KTLA&#x27;s &quot;Fantastick Studios, Ink&quot;. At 11, she appeared in two episodes of &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;. She had an uncredited role in the film &quot;Thunder in the East&quot; (1951) and was in episodes of &quot;Sky King&quot;, &quot;Fireside Theatre&quot;, and &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot;.

She attended Powers Professional School and received her high school diploma from Hollywood Professional School in the spring of 1955 at age 14. With a reported IQ of 162, at age 15 St. John enrolled at UCLA&#x27;s Extension School.

During this time, she lent her voice to a large number of radio shows, notably &quot;Red Ryder&quot; and &quot;One Man&#x27;s Family&quot;.

===Universal===

St. John was 16 in May 1957 when Universal Pictures signed her to a contract for seven years starting at $200 a week. Her major studio film debut was in &quot;Summer Love&quot; (1958) starring John Saxon. She also appeared on TV in episodes of &quot;The Christophers&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, and &quot;The DuPont Show of the Month&quot; (an adaptation of &quot;Junior Miss&quot;). She said her idol was Kay Kendall.

===20th Century Fox===

St. John then signed a contract with 20th Century Fox, who tried to build her into a star. She played the daughter of Clifton Webb in &quot;The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker&quot; and &quot;Holiday for Lovers&quot; (both 1959), then was put in an adventure movie, &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1960).

&quot;Nothing but starlet parts,&quot; she later said. &quot;You know, the daughter, the niece, the girlfriend.&quot;

Fox picked up their option on her. Warner Bros. borrowed St. John for &quot;The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone&quot; (1961), then she had a supporting role in &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot; (1962), for which she beat out Jane Fonda.

===Comedy===
St. John had a key role in &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot; (1963), where she starred opposite Frank Sinatra. She received a Golden Globe Award nomination as Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her performance in the film.

&quot;I&#x27;m a comedienne,&quot; she said in 1963. &quot;I&#x27;ve never pretended to be a dramatic actress. But I&#x27;m very funny.&quot;

She followed this with a series of comedies: &quot;Who&#x27;s Minding the Store?&quot; (1963) with Jerry Lewis, &quot;Who&#x27;s Been Sleeping in My Bed?&quot; (1963) with Dean Martin, and &quot;Honeymoon Hotel&quot; (1964) with Robert Morse and Nancy Kwan.
&quot;Now I play the sexy comedienne, which is my forte&quot; she said in 1964. &quot;Comedy is what I&#x27;ve always wanted to do.&quot;

She guest-starred on television shows like &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;The Rogues&quot;, and &quot;Theatre of Stars&quot;. In 1964, she guest-starred with Lauren Bacall and Bacall&#x27;s then husband, Jason Robards, Jr., in the episode &quot;Take a Walk Through the Cemetery&quot; of the drama series &quot;Mr. Broadway&quot;. She also appeared in some variety specials with Bob Hope.

MGM gave her the female lead in a spy spoof &quot;The Liquidator&quot; (1965) with Rod Taylor, and she was in &quot;The Oscar&quot; (1966) with Stephen Boyd.

St. John appeared in the first and second episodes of the television series &quot;Batman&quot; as the Riddler&#x27;s moll Molly. She became the first character to die in an episode of &quot;Batman&quot; in that second episode. She was also in an episode of &quot;The Big Valley&quot; at that time.

===Universal reprise===

St. John signed a contract at Universal. She was in a TV movie &quot;Fame Is the Name of the Game&quot; (1966), and had a supporting role in &quot;How I Spent My Summer Vacation&quot; (1967), starring future husband Robert Wagner.

She did the Bob Hope comedy &quot;Eight on the Lam&quot; (1967), then made &quot;Banning&quot; (1967) with Wagner, and &quot;The King&#x27;s Pirate&quot; (1967) with Doug McClure.

In 1966, she said &quot;My goal is to be at a point where I have so proved myself as an actress that I can be more discriminating in the roles I choose. I want to be able to choose the parts I know I can do next.&quot; St. John nearly landed a starring role in &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; (1967), which instead went to Sharon Tate.

She was reunited with Sinatra in &quot;Tony Rome&quot; (1967) and did a TV movie &quot;The Spy Killer&quot; (1969), which was popular enough for the sequel &quot;Foreign Exchange&quot; (1970). She guested on &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;. &quot;Decisions! Decisions!&quot; (1971) was a TV movie St. John did with Bob Newhart and Jean Simmons.

===James Bond===
St. John achieved her biggest success starring as diamond smuggler Tiffany Case, the love interest of James Bond in &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971), opposite Sean Connery. She was the first American to play a Bond girl. The character Tiffany is argumentative, abrasive, loud, and brash when compared to previous Bond girls who were more demure; film scholars have inferred that she is meant to be a stereotypical commentary on American women.

In 1972, St. John appeared alongside Oliver Reed in the British crime drama &quot;Sitting Target&quot;. After the shoot wrapped, she took a break from her career. She later explained that &quot;two pictures in a row was exhausting... I decided I needed a new way of life.&quot;

===Television===
St. John did the TV movies &quot;Saga of Sonora&quot; (1973) and &quot;Brenda Starr&quot; (1976) (playing the title role), and guest-starred on &quot;Vega$&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, and &quot;Matt Houston&quot;. She also appeared in the pilot episode for &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;. She was cast as the princess in &quot;Day of the Assassin&quot; (1979), but bowed out when her deposit failed to arrive on time; Susana Dosamantes replaced her.

In 1981, following a decade-long sabbatical in Aspen, Colorado, St. John made Hollywood her primary residence again. &quot;I really don&#x27;t have to work,&quot; she said of her return. &quot;But you know what? I got bored.&quot;
St. John did the TV movies &quot;Two Guys from Muck&quot; (1982) and &quot;Rooster&quot; (1982) and was top-billed in the feature &quot;The Concrete Jungle&quot; (1982), a woman in prison film in which she played Warden Fletcher. She had a small role in &quot;The Act&quot; (1983).

During 1983–1984, she starred with Dennis Weaver on the short-lived soap opera &quot;Emerald Point N.A.S.&quot;, in which she played Deanna Kinkaid, Thomas Mallory&#x27;s conniving former sister-in-law. It also starred another former Bond girl, Maud Adams.

===Later career===
St. John and Robert Wagner were in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1989); &quot;Something to Believe In&quot; (1998); and &quot;The Calling&quot; (2002). They made brief cameo appearances as themselves in Robert Altman&#x27;s Hollywood satire &quot;The Player&quot; (1992).

In 1996, they started appearing together on stage in a national touring production of &quot;Love Letters&quot;.

In 1997, the couple appeared together at the end of &quot;The Yada Yada&quot; episode of the television sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

St. John appeared without Wagner in &quot;Out There&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Trip&quot; (2002).

In 2014, St. John played Mrs. Claus in the TV movie &quot;Northpole&quot; alongside Wagner, who played the part of Santa Claus. The film marked her first acting role after a 12-year absence from the screen. She has since officially retired from acting, but remains involved in civic activities.

==Avocation==
In 1972, St. John largely left Hollywood behind and moved to Aspen, where she focused on personal interests and cooking. She is among the celebrities credited with increasing the popularity of the town along with Goldie Hawn and Jack Nicholson.

Her interest in cooking eventually led to her becoming a culinary personality, appearing in monthly cooking segments on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and her writing a column in &quot;USA Weekend&quot; magazine through the 1980s. This culminated in the writing of &quot;The Jill St. John Cookbook&quot; (1987), a collection of healthy recipes and some anecdotes.

St. John also developed a handmade Angora sweater business, and became interested in orchid growing, skiing, hiking, river rafting, camping, and gardening. In 1987, she said &quot;I&#x27;m a mountain gal now. I love the outdoors and I love harvesting and using fresh vegetables and herbs.&quot;

==Charity work==
During the Vietnam War, St. John entertained American soldiers at United Service Organizations (USO) shows.

She is founder of the Aunts Club, a Rancho Mirage-based group of women who contribute at least $1,000 per year to provide financial support for a child.

==Politics==
St. John ran unsuccessfully in 2023 for a board seat on the Aspen Fire Department. She is a Republican.

==Personal life==
St. John has been married four times. Her husbands:
* Neil Dubin (May 12, 1957 – July 3, 1958; divorced) St. John was 16 years old when they eloped to Yuma, Arizona. Dubin was heir to a linen fortune. St. John complained that he harassed and ridiculed her.
* Lance Reventlow (March 24, 1960 – October 30, 1963; divorced) Reventlow was the son of Barbara Hutton, heir to the F. W. Woolworth fortune. St. John received a settlement of $86,000. Despite their divorce and subsequent remarriages, she refers to Reventlow as &quot;my late husband&quot; in interviews.
* Jack Jones (October 14, 1967 – February 28, 1969; divorced) Jones said demands on his singing career and the involved traveling contributed to the breakup.
* Robert Wagner (May 26, 1990 – present) The couple first met in 1959 when they were contract players at 20th Century Fox, and have been together since Valentine&#x27;s Day 1982.

Between marriages, St. John dated entertainment, sports, and political personalities including Gianni Bulgari, Sammy Cahn, Michael Caine, Oleg Cassini, Barry Coe, Sean Connery, Robert Evans, Glenn Ford, David Frost, Jack Haley Jr., Bill Hudson, Henry Kissinger, Sidney Korshak, Peter Lawford, George Lazenby, Jim Lonborg, Trini López, Tom Mankiewicz, George Montgomery, Joe Namath, Jack Nicholson, Hugh O&#x27;Brian, Ogden Mills Phipps, Roman Polanski, Alejandro Rey, Tom Selleck, Frank Sinatra, Robert Vaughn, Giovanni Volpi, Adam West and David L. Wolper.

St. John has also had amorous relationships with criminal court judge Jerome M. Becker, ski instructor Ricky Head, Olympic ski champion Brownie Barnes, plastic surgeon Steven Zax, investment broker Lenny Ross, Chicago businessman Delbert W. Coleman and Brazilian entrepreneur Francisco &quot;Baby&quot; Pignatari. She was engaged to Miami real estate developer Robert Blum in 1974, but called off the engagement.

She has three stepdaughters:
* Katie Wagner, born 1964 to Wagner and Marion Marshall
* Natasha Gregson, born 1970 to Richard Gregson and Natalie Wood, but raised in the Wagner/St. John household after Wood died
* Courtney Wagner, born 1974 to Wagner and Wood

In 2007, Wagner and St. John sold the Brentwood ranchette they&#x27;d lived on since 1983 for a reported $14 million and relocated full-time to Aspen.

Mutual animosity between St. John and her husband&#x27;s former sister-in-law, actress Lana Wood, extends back to 1971, when Sean Connery was simultaneously involved with both women during the filming of &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;. The pair&#x27;s half-century feud has been highlighted by two well-documented public altercations: one in September 1999, when St. John refused to be photographed with Wood at a Bond girl reunion for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine, and another in February 2016, when Wood crashed an event honoring St. John in Palm Springs and confronted Wagner over the reopened homicide case of her sister Natalie, who drowned in 1981 while yachting with Wagner off the coast of Santa Catalina Island.

<text>The University of Vermont (UVM), officially the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College, is a public land-grant research university in Burlington, Vermont, United States. Founded in 1791, UVM is the oldest university in Vermont and the fifth-oldest in New England.

UVM comprises ten colleges and schools, including the Robert Larner College of Medicine, and offers more than 100 undergraduate majors along with various graduate and professional programs. The University of Vermont Medical Center, has its primary facility on the UVM campus. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities—Very high research activity&quot;. 

In athletics, UVM&#x27;s teams, known as the Catamounts, compete in NCAA Division I, primarily in the America East Conference and Hockey East Association. 

UVM alumni includes several Olympians, Fulbright Scholars, Truman Scholars, Goldwater Scholars, and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate.

==History==
The University of Vermont was founded as a private university in 1791, the same year Vermont became the fourteenth U.S. state. The university enrolled its first students ten years later. Its first president, Daniel C. Sanders, was hired in 1800, and served as the sole faculty member for seven years. Instruction began in 1801, and the first class graduated in 1804. In 1865, the university merged with Vermont Agricultural College (chartered November 22, 1864, after the passage of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862), emerging as the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College. The university was granted 150,000 acres, which it sold for $122,626.Much of the initial funding and planning for the university was undertaken by Ira Allen, who is honored as UVM&#x27;s founder. Allen donated a parcel of land for establishment of the university. Most of this land has been maintained as the university&#x27;s main green, where stands a statue of Allen.
The citizens of Burlington helped fund the university&#x27;s first edifice. When it was destroyed by fire in 1824, they also paid for its replacement. This building came to be known as &quot;Old Mill&quot; for its resemblance to New England mills of the time. The Marquis de Lafayette, a French general who became a commander in the American Revolution, while in Vermont laid the cornerstone of Old Mill, which stands on University Row along with Ira Allen Chapel, Billings Library, Williams Hall, Royall Tyler Theatre, and Morrill Hall. A statue of Lafayette stands at the north end of the main green.

UVM was the first American institution of higher education with a charter declaring that the &quot;rules, regulations, and by-laws shall not tend to give preference to any religious sect or denomination whatsoever&quot;.

In 1871, UVM defied custom and admitted two women as students. It was the first American university to admit women (1875) and African Americans (1877) into Phi Beta Kappa, the country&#x27;s oldest collegiate academic honor society.

Justin Smith Morrill, a U.S. Representative (1855–1867), and Senator (1867–1898) from Vermont, author of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act that created federal funding for establishing the U.S. land-grant colleges and universities, served as a trustee of the university from 1865 to 1898.

In 1924, UVM&#x27;s WCAX, now called WVMT, sent out the first radio broadcast in Vermont. It was run by UVM students and faculty before being sold in 1931. WCAX is now the call sign of a commercial television station. A new radio station was set up in 1955, dubbed WRUV. It currently runs a FM broadcast at 90.1 MHz and an internet stream at wruv.org. The station, run by students, faculty, and local community members, dubs itself &quot;Burlington&#x27;s Better Alternative&quot;&quot;.&quot; It is known for playing a wide range of music, boasting &quot;the largest catalog in the State of Vermont&quot; at over 50,000 albums.

In the second half of the 20th century, UVM gained a reputation for its political activism, and struggles ensued on campus between student and faculty activists and the university administration. In 1953, the university&#x27;s board of trustees ousted Alex B. Novikoff, a tenured professor and cell biologist in the College of Medicine, over his association with the Communist Party.In March 1957, student protests against a motel owner who refused service to an African-American woman led the Vermont General Assembly to outlaw discrimination in public accommodations. For 73 years, UVM held an annual &quot;Kake Walk&quot; where students wore blackface, until the practice was abolished in 1969 under pressure from the student body and the community.

In 1972, the board of trustees intervened again to deny tenure to Michael Parenti, a popular Marxist political science professor who drew ire from the authorities due to his participation in anti-war demonstrations. The board overrode the recommendation of the faculty, the deans&#x27; council and the administration. Parenti later brought a federal suit against the university, which was settled out of court for $15,000.

In the 1980s, the university faced increasing pressure from the student body to divest from companies doing business in apartheid South Africa. Student protests against investment in apartheid culminated in the construction of a &quot;shantytown&quot; on the green across from the Waterman building on October 12, 1985. On December 6, the board voted 12-7 to divest.

UVM has undertaken several other divestment actions due to advocacy from student groups, including divestment from &quot;Sudan-friendly&quot; companies in 2006, during the Darfur genocide, and divestment from cluster munitions and depleted uranium weapons in 2009, during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. In 2013 and 2016, trustees rejected calls to divest from fossil fuels.

On July 1, 2019, Suresh Garimella was appointed UVM&#x27;s 27th president. Under his tenure, the university faced record enrollment and a 50 percent increase in research funding to $250 million; however, he has been criticized for his public relations with students and faculty. In 2021, the university administration imposed budget cuts that terminated three departments, 12 majors, 11 minors and four master&#x27;s degree programs in the College of Arts and Sciences.

In 2020, under pressure from a student campaign, UVM trustees voted unanimously to divest from fossil fuels by July 2023.

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Education opened an investigation into the university&#x27;s response to antisemitism on campus based on a Title VI complaint filed by The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and Jewish on Campus. The investigation concluded in April 2023, after the university and the Office of Civil Rights settled in a voluntary resolution. A press release from the Department of Education stated that the university failed to adequately respond to incidents. University administrators denied the allegations, insisting that they responded appropriately. The university agreed to adopt new practices around bias reporting, edit their discrimination and harassment policies, and provide extra training to staff and students, but it did not adopt the demands of the complainant. The Department of Education did not make a finding of guilt or wrongdoing or create new federal policy in closing the investigation.

In October 2023, UVM&#x27;s Division of Safety and Compliance abruptly canceled a planned guest lecture by Palestinian author Mohammed El-Kurd, citing an inability to provide adequate &quot;safety and security&quot; for the event. An investigative report by Seven Days found no evidence of threats related to the event.

The university&#x27;s graduate students voted to unionize with the UAW in March 2024. In April 2024, UVM&#x27;s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine established a protest encampment on the Andrew Harris Commons, demanding transparency in the university&#x27;s endowment and divestment from &quot;all weapons manufacturers, Israeli companies, and companies involved in the occupation of historic Palestine.&quot; They also demanded that the university cancel a planned commencement speech by Linda Thomas-Greenfield.

==Seal==
The university first adopted an official seal in 1807. The seal depicts the sun rising over the Green Mountains with the original college edifice, now the remodeled Old Mill. It includes a diagram of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;windmill proof&quot; of the Pythagorean theorem, a globe, and a sextant. It includes the motto &quot;Universitas V. Montis. A.D. 1791&quot; in the outer ring &quot;Collegiumque Agriculturae&quot; in the inner one, noting the establishment of the College of Agriculture in 1865.

==Academics==

Offering over 100 undergraduate majors, the university comprises seven undergraduate colleges, an honors college, a graduate college, and a medical college.

In 2015, the university launched a wellness program called the Wellness Environment, or WE, a substance-free residential program that gives interested students access to fitness and nutrition coaches, has daily yoga instruction, round-the-clock meditation sessions, and a mentorship program that pairs them with a Burlington youth. In the fall of 2017, the Central Campus Residence Hall completed construction, and now houses nearly 700 residents in the Wellness Environment.

Thanks to an organization known as GIRT, or Gender Inclusive Restroom Taskforce, the University of Vermont has a growing number of single-occupancy, gender-neutral bathrooms for use by non-binary and gender non-conforming students, faculty, and visitors.

=== Outing Club ===
The UVM Outing Club was established in 1913 and is the largest outing club in the country. The club is student-run and offers kayaking, canoeing, hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, ice climbing, backcountry skiing, and nordic skiing trips. The club has assisted with the formation of TREK, an outdoor pre-orientation student program that takes incoming freshman on 5 day excursions to connect them to the UVM community and the State of Vermont. Annually, the club runs the Catamountain Classic event, in which participants hike all 272 miles of the Long Trail in one weekend.

=== Events ===
UVM Program Board (UPB) is responsible for bringing campus events and activities to the UVM community. In recent years, UPB has organized events like the annual SpringFest featuring comedian Michelle Wolf, Two Door Cinema Club and Laverne Cox. It also runs battles of the bands, weekly pub quiz tournaments, and international film and food events.

=== Concerts ===

In addition to campus events, UPB organizes live musical entertainment featuring acts from across the country as well as local bands. UPB is composed of four committees, one of which is a concerts committee. The concerts committee learns about various aspects of the music industry by putting on shows and working with local sound and production professionals. Students are in charge of choosing and booking bands and are responsible for all production aspects on the day of the show.

The Concert Bureau was established in 1971, inviting artists such as R.E.M., Phish (three of its four members attended UVM in the 1980s), Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sting, Lou Reed, Primus, The String Cheese Incident, James Brown, Bob Dylan, The Allman Brothers Band, Death Cab for Cutie, Jurassic 5, the Disco Biscuits, The Grateful Dead, Guster, and The Flaming Lips.

Since 2001, the annual SpringFest is held in April. Headliners have included Vida Blue, The Roots, Cake, Keller Williams, Gov&#x27;t Mule, co-headliners Robert Randolph &amp; the Family Band, Ziggy Marley, and Talib Kweli. Other acts to perform at various SpringFests have included The Meditations, Toots &amp; the Maytals, Soulive, Rjd2, Apollo Sunshine, Ratatat in 2009, MSTRKRFT in 2010, The Roots and Thievery Corporation in 2011, Dillon Francis in 2012, MGMT in 2013, Atmosphere in 2014, The Disco Biscuits in 2015, The Head and the Heart in 2016, Two Door Cinema Club in 2017, and Playboi Carti in 2018.

=== Greek life ===
The University of Vermont Greek community is one of the oldest in the nation, with the first fraternal organization starting in 1836. 5% of male students and 5% of female students join Greek life. Fraternity and sorority members become involved in Student Government Association (SGA) and work as Orientation Leaders, advocates, and Residence Assistants.

The Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, also known as FIJI, was suspended for four years in 2017 due to hazing and alcohol abuse. One of the fraternity&#x27;s pledges had stolen a Black Lives Matter flag from a flagpole as part of a hazing ritual.

==Sustainability==
The University of Vermont has a long history of environmental sustainability on its campus. In , &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; placed UVM in 16th place among the &quot;Top 50 Green Colleges&quot; in the country.

=== 1990s ===
In 1995, the Environmental Council at UVM was established to fill a gap regarding a bridge between operations and academics on campus greening issues. The council&#x27;s first project was to hear presentations from the various environmental programs on campus to provide a baseline scan of campus operation environmental impact. Greening UVM was published in 1998 by the council to establish a baseline on the environmental impact of the campus&#x27; operations. During the same year, a recycled paper policy was created and was implemented in 1999. As a community stakeholder in the Lab-XL project, the Environmental Council received an EPA grant to support the &quot;Tracking UVM&quot; project and publication to assess the relative environmental impact and community interest in laboratory chemical waste. Tracking UVM, a follow-up to the Greening UVM report, was published in 2002 and reported on the environmental progress of the university from 1990 to 2000. The University of Vermont&#x27;s commitment to tracking its environmental performance was recognized in 2004 with Vermont&#x27;s Governor&#x27;s Award for Environmental Excellence for this 2002 environmental report card. Tracking UVM is one of the first report cards that track the environmental impact of campus operations in an institution of higher education.

=== 2000s ===
In 2005, UVM&#x27;s President Daniel M. Fogel signed the institution&#x27;s Green Building Policy. The recycled paper policy was updated in 2006 after two students pushed for the university to commit to purchasing 100% post-consumer, chlorine-free paper for routine copying and printing.

In 2007, President Fogel signed on to the American College &amp; University Presidents&#x27; Climate Commitment. In 2008, UVM dissolved the Environmental Council and established the Office of Sustainability. 

=== 2010s ===
In 2011, UVM released its Climate Action Plan to the American College &amp; University President&#x27;s Climate Commitment. The Climate Action Plan focuses on the direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the institution&#x27;s operations. The target dates for UVM&#x27;s Climate Action Plan were 2015 for 100% carbon neutral electricity (Scope 1) and 2020 for carbon neutral heating, cooling, and fleet (Scope 2). UVM aims to target the net zero emissions for its &quot;Scope 3&quot; sources by 2025.

In 2012, UVM became one of the first institutions nationwide to end the sale of bottled water on campus and mandate that one third of drinks offered in vending machines be healthy options. During the same year, UVM&#x27;s Board of Trustees passed a resolution to earmark $13 million for the fund, making it the largest challenge to date. Harvard&#x27;s $12 million green loan fund had been the largest. In March 2012, UVM became fifth school in the nation to sign the &quot;Real Food Campus Commitment&quot;, pledging to purchase 20% &quot;real food&quot; by 2020. In April 2017, UVM announced it had surpassed this goal and set a new goal to source 25% &quot;real food&quot; by 2020.

The Certification for Sustainable Transportation (CST) was founded in 2012 to help improve economic, environmental, and energy efficiency within the passenger transportation sector. The CST is a direct outgrowth of work that began at the University of Vermont in 2005 and now houses the eRating certification, driver trainings, and an array of awareness and education programs. It is a nonprofit operating out of UVM&#x27;s Extensions office.

In May 2015, UVM introduced a sustainability requirement for all undergraduates, allowing students to choose from pre-approved sustainability classes.

=== Present ===
In April 2023, the university committed to carbon neutrality by 2030. It would pursue investments in renewable energy, electrified buildings and vehicles, reduced vehicle fleets, and geothermal exploration.

==Lawrence Debate Union==

The Lawrence Debate Union (LDU) has been UVM&#x27;s official debate team since 1899. Competing in British parliamentary debate, policy debate, and social justice-oriented debate, it is one of the oldest organizations on campus, receiving funding from a private grant established in 1899. The LDU has sent students to international competitions, from Slovenia, Malaysia, and Thailand (2007) to Greece and South Africa. The school has also sent students to the World Universities Debating Championship held in Ireland, Turkey, Botswana, Manila, Berlin, and Chennai, breaking into elimination rounds in the 2011 World University Debating Championship. Debaters from the LDU have also regularly competed in tournaments hosted by Oxford University and Cambridge University, and in 2013 won the title of the Budapest IV and Vienna IV in consecutive tournaments. Domestically, the LDU has also won the title of Northeast Universities Debating Sweepstakes champion for four consecutive years. The program is currently ranked seventh in the top schools for British Parliamentary debate in the world, and is the third-ranked American university on the list, behind only Yale and Cornell. It encourages participation of all interested UVM students, and sponsors public debates at UVM and for the Burlington community. Alfred C. Snider, who coached the LDU for over thirty years, was one of the most decorated debate coaches in the world. He also coached the National Speech and Debate Organization&#x27;s national high school debate team to compete in the world championships.

<text>Hypermedia, an extension of hypertext, is a nonlinear medium of information that includes graphics, audio, video, plain text and hyperlinks. This designation contrasts with the broader term &quot;multimedia&quot;, which may include non-interactive linear presentations as well as hypermedia. The term was first used in a 1965 article written by Ted Nelson.
Hypermedia is a type of multimedia that features interactive elements, such as hypertext, buttons, or interactive images and videos, allowing users to navigate and engage with content in a non-linear manner.

The World Wide Web is a classic example of hypermedia to access web content, whereas a conventional cinema presentation is an example of standard multimedia, due to its inherent linearity and lack of interactivity via hyperlinks.

The first hypermedia work was, arguably, the Aspen Movie Map. Bill Atkinson&#x27;s HyperCard popularized hypermedia writing, while a variety of literary hypertext and non-fiction hypertext works, demonstrated the promise of hyperlinks. Most modern hypermedia is delivered via electronic pages from a variety of systems including media players, web browsers, and stand-alone applications (i.e., software that does not require network access). Audio hypermedia is emerging with voice command devices and voice browsing.

==Development tools==

Hypermedia may be developed in a number of ways. Any programming tool can be used to write programs that link data from internal variables and nodes for external data files. Multimedia development software such as Adobe Flash, Adobe Director, Macromedia Authorware, and MatchWare Mediator may be used to create stand-alone hypermedia applications, with emphasis on entertainment content. Some database software, such as Visual FoxPro and FileMaker Developer, may be used to develop stand-alone hypermedia applications, with emphasis on educational and business content management.

Hypermedia applications may be developed on embedded devices for the mobile and the digital signage industries using the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) specification from W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). Software applications, such as Ikivo Animator and Inkscape, simplify the development of hypermedia content based on SVG. Embedded devices, such as the iPhone, natively support SVG specifications and may be used to create mobile and distributed hypermedia applications.

Hyperlinks may also be added to data files using most business software via the limited scripting and hyperlinking features built in. Documentation software, such as the Microsoft Office Suite and LibreOffice, allow for hypertext links to other content within the same file, other external files, and URL links to files on external file servers. For more emphasis on graphics and page layout, hyperlinks may be added using most modern desktop publishing tools. This includes presentation programs, such as Microsoft PowerPoint and LibreOffice Impress, add-ons to print layout programs such as Quark Immedia, and tools to include hyperlinks in PDF documents such as Adobe InDesign for creating and Adobe Acrobat for editing. Hyper Publish is a tool specifically designed and optimized for hypermedia and hypertext management. Any HTML editor may be used to build HTML files, accessible by any web browser. CD/DVD authoring tools, such as DVD Studio Pro, may be used to hyperlink the content of DVDs for DVD players or web links when the disc is played on a personal computer connected to the internet.

==Learning==
There have been a number of theories concerning hypermedia and learning. One important claim in the literature on hypermedia and learning is that it offers more control over the instructional environment for the reader or student. Another claim is that it levels the playing field among students of varying abilities and enhances collaborative learning. A claim from psychology includes the notion that hypermedia more closely models the structure of the brain, in comparison with printed text.

==Application programming interfaces==

Hypermedia is used as a medium and constraint in certain application programming interfaces. HATEOAS, Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State, is a constraint of the REST application architecture where a client interacts with the server entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers. This means that in theory no API documentation is needed, because the client needs no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia. In other service-oriented architectures (SOA), clients and servers interact through a fixed interface shared through documentation or an interface description language (IDL).

<text>The Harlem River is an tidal strait in New York City, flowing between the Hudson River and the East River and separating the island of Manhattan from the Bronx on the United States mainland.

The northern stretch, also called the Spuyten Duyvil (&quot;spewing devil&quot;) Creek, has been significantly altered for navigation purposes. Originally it curved around the north of Marble Hill, but in 1895 the Harlem Ship Canal was dug between Manhattan and Marble Hill, and in 1914 the original course was filled in.

==Use==
Harlem River Drive and Harlem River Greenway run along the west bank of the river, and the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line and Major Deegan Expressway on the east.
The Harlem River was the traditional rowing course for New York, analogous to the Charles River in Boston and the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia. On the Harlem&#x27;s banks is the boathouse for the Columbia University crew, and the river is the home course for the university&#x27;s crew. Since 1952, a large flat rock face, called the &quot;(Big) C Rock&quot; has been painted with Columbia&#x27;s varsity &quot;C&quot;. Also on the river are the Peter Jay Sharp Boathouse and Harlem River Community Rowing, two community rowing facilities. The river is used by crews from New York University, Fordham University, and Manhattan University, though the only university with permanent facilities on the river is Columbia.

Historically, the west bank of the Harlem River was also an amusement destination. The area between 190th and 192nd Streets was occupied by the Fort George Amusement Park, a trolley park/amusement park, from 1895 to 1914. Its site is now a seating area in Highbridge Park. In the 1890s, the City of New York built a racetrack for horses, the Harlem River Speedway, along the riverbank of the park; the project started construction in 1894 and opened in July 1898. The Speedway later became the Harlem River Drive, and regular motorists were first allowed on the drive in 1919.

The Harlem River is spanned by seven swing bridges, four lift bridges, and four arch bridges, and is navigable to any boat with less than of air draft. However, any boat requiring more than of clearance will require the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge to swing open. All other movable bridges on the Harlem River provide at least of clearance while closed, so boats and ships requiring between of clearance need only have one bridge swing open. These bridges replaced fixed bridges or lower bridges in the late 19th century to improve navigation. High Bridge was erected between 1837 and 1848 to carry the Croton Aqueduct across the river. It is the oldest bridge in New York City.

The New York City Department of Transportation advises that while they make every effort to ensure that all bridges are operating, many of them are under repair at any time, and outside contractors are responsible for opening of bridges under repair.

<text>The Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association (&quot;B-PSA&quot;) is a worldwide youth organisation originating in the United Kingdom, with friendly relationships with similar traditional scouting organisations in various countries. Baden-Powell Scouting focuses on the importance of tradition in the scout movement. 

The Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association shares the heritage of the youth scouting movement, however they believe in a traditional way of scouting which closely follows the programme set out by Lt. General Robert Baden-Powell in his book: &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;.

The Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association was formed in the United Kingdom in 1970 by the Reverend William Dowling when it was felt that the Scout Association was abandoning the traditions and intentions set out by Baden-Powell in 1908. The Baden-Powell Scouts retain the belief that the essence of the movement should be based on outdoor activities related to the skills of explorers, backwoodsmen and frontiersmen.

It is a voluntary, non-formal educational charity association for young people. It is an independent, non-political, and non-military organisation. The B-PSA believes this programme should be available to everyone.

As an independent scout association, they are members of the World Federation of Independent Scouts (WFIS). The WFIS was formed in Laubach, Germany, in 1996 by Lawrie Dring, a scouter and President of the B-PSA, and scouts from Laubach. The WFIS is an international body that recognises independent scouts associations in countries around the world that teach traditional Baden-Powell scouting values. Their aim is to improve the standard of future citizens with the object of using their efficiency for service for their fellows.

==History==
&quot;For the origins and history of the scout movement generally see: Scouting&quot;

Following the origin of the Boy Scout Movement and, in 1908, the publication of Robert Baden-Powell&#x27;s book, &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, the Boy Scouts Association was formed in 1910 and, until 1967, it followed the programme established by Baden-Powell. However, the publication of &quot;the Chief Scouts&#x27; Advance Party Report&quot;, introduced major changes to that association&#x27;s name, uniform, sections and programme.

In 1969, some of those, led by the Reverend William Dowling, who did not agree with changes being introduced following the &quot;Advance Party Report&quot; formed a pressure group within the Scout Association, known as &#x27;the Scout Action Group&#x27;. They asked that Scout Groups wishing to maintain a more traditional approach to Scouting should be allowed to do so. In mid-1970 the Scout Action Group published &quot;A Boy Scout Black Paper&quot;, which outlined their views.

As a result of discussions, the whole organisation fractioned into two groups on 20 September 1970 – The Scout Association and the Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association.

In 1979, due to internal arguments, the Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association split into two organisations, with both claiming the name and charity number of the association. The two factions reconciled their differences in June 1990, and in 1994 there were nearly 70 groups in the association.

In the 1990s there was a dip in the number of active groups in the Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association, in common with a fall in numbers experienced by the various United Kingdom Scout organisations at that time, and the number of groups had dropped to around 40 in 2001. The Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association, as with Scouting in the United Kingdom generally, has shown subsequent growth in numbers with the opening of new groups. A report in &quot;The Times&quot; in August 2004 gave a membership of 5,000 in 56 groups.

The B-PSA celebrated 100 years of Scouting in 2007, issuing centenary badges and holding their own Centenary Camp in Southampton.
Jamboree 2008, marked the centenary of the first official Scout Camp held by Baden-Powell at Humshaugh. The event included parades at Hexham Abbey and a ceremony at the original Carr Edge camp site.

==Aims, methods and ideals==
The main policy is Traditional Scouting – which is taking Baden-Powell&#x27;s original nine Scout Laws and the later 10th Scout Law and using them, along with Baden-Powell&#x27;s original training programme and rank system.

Once a Scout is invested Baden-Powell believed that he would continue to live the Scout Law. This law is kept by Scouts from the age of ten and Adult Leaders must renew their promise on regular occasions. The original Scout Law, written by Baden-Powell, appeared in 1908. The Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association uses his 1911 version, which is as follows:

# A Scout&#x27;s honour is to be trusted
# A Scout is loyal to the King and to his officers, and to his country, and to his employers.
# A Scout&#x27;s duty is to be useful and to help others.
# A Scout is a friend to all and a brother to every other Scout, no matter to what social class the other belongs.
# A Scout is courteous.
# A Scout is a friend to animals.
# A Scout obeys orders of his patrol leader or Scout master without question.
# A Scout smiles and whistles under all difficulties.
# A Scout is thrifty.
# A Scout is clean in thought, word and deed.

The Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association hold to the ideals of Scouting that were created by Baden-Powell. The association&#x27;s heritage dates back to the foundations of Scouting in the UK in 1908. The association follows a charter set down in their Policy Association Rules. They have no paid Executive Staff or Leaders.

The traditional programme also develops a sense of duty, personal discipline and honour. In addition to a wide range of activities Scouts in the B-PSA continue to practise traditional Scouting skills:
* lighting fire by friction
* navigating by means other than a compass
* backwoods cooking
* camping in self erected &quot;bivvys&quot;

The Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association are members of the World Federation of Independent Scouts. The Baden-Powell Scouts use the original programmes and wear traditional uniforms. Wolf Cubs continue to use the Grand Howl at the beginning and end of their meetings.
The advancement program for members of the Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association is symbolised by the earning of badges and awards. 

In Wolf Cubs this consists of Tenderpad, First Star and Second Star – working towards the final award of Leaping Wolf. The First and Second Stars are worn on the Cub&#x27;s cap, this positioning leading them to sometimes be referred to as one, then both, eyes open.

In the Scouts section they use the same ranks as in &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; with Tenderfoot, Second Class, First Class, and the Scout Cord. Senior Scouts can earn the Bushman&#x27;s Thong (with variations for Air and Sea Scouts) and the St. George&#x27;s Scout award, which takes the place of the Queen&#x27;s Scout award. Rover Scouts are able to earn the Baden-Powell Award.

The requirements for these badges, and the overall designs of the award badges, remain true to the pre-1967 Boy Scouts Association requirements and designs, with the stars on the original awards being replaced by the initials B and P, and the word &quot;BOY&quot; being replaced by &quot;B-P&quot;.

==Uniform==
The Scout sections wear the traditional uniform designed by Baden-Powell.
* Headwear: Campaign hat or beret, with the Section badge in front.
* Neckerchief: Of the group colour worn with a woggle or a loose knot at the throat.
* Shirt: In non-Sea Scout or Air Scout Groups, a khaki shirt. Air Scouts wear Wedgwood Blue.
* Shorts or trousers: Khaki or dark blue for Air Scouts.
* Belt: Brown leather, official pattern.
* Socks: Any plain colour, worn turned down below the knee
* Boots or shoes: Brown or black.
* Shoulder badge: Indicating the group, worn on the right shoulder.

==Organisation==

===Sections===
The Baden-Powell Scout&#x27;s Association retains the pre-Advance Party Report (1967) sections, the traditional UK Scout sections developed by Baden-Powell, to which Beavers were added in 1982. The association is open to males and females in mixed and separate sections.

The sections (Beavers to Senior Scouts) are led by a Section Master, who must hold a warrant for the position, aided by assistants. Other adults who help run a section may be volunteers (such as parents of children in the group), Instructors (Scouts, Senior Scouts and Rovers that have been trained to assist the leaders), and members of the group executive committee who help operate the group financially. Rover Crews mainly govern themselves, but are assisted by a Rover Scout Leader who ensures that the crew is working within the rules of the association.

===Group branches===
There are Air Scouts and the provision for Sea Scouts within the organisation. These branches follow the same core programme as other sections but add more aeronautical or nautical emphasis depending on the branch.

==Child protection==
In common with other United Kingdom youth organisations all adults have to undergo extended criminal record checks since their introduction in 1997. New leaders are required to give personal references and complete an interview before taking an appointment. The B-PSA has a child protection officer and there is a full child protection policy in place.

Each international association follows the child protection measures expected in their own country.

==International associations==

===Australia===
The 1st Devonport Scouts in Tasmania under Alan Richmond, OAM, several groups in South Australia under Frank Payne and later groups in New South Wales and another in Queensland affiliated with the B-PSA.

===Canada===

The B-PSA was first organized in Canada in Victoria, British Columbia in February 1996 as the Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association of Canada (BPSA Canada). Scouts Canada lodged a complaint against this name with Industry Canada. This prompted the association to reorganize on a provincial basis. BPSA Associations currently operate in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.

===Denmark===
The Yellow Scouts of Denmark – Baden-Powell Scouts (De Gule Speijdere i Danmark) started on 25 February 1984, as &quot;Det Danske Pige- og Drenge Spejderkorps&quot;, aiming to return to a more traditional Scouting approach as a response to changes in the mainstream Danish Scouting movement.

===Ghana===
The Baden-Powell Scouts Association is active in Ghana. The Baden-Powell Scouts of Ghana operates in Accra, Ghana. It has a Beaver Lodge of 40, two Wolf Cub Packs of 30 and a Scout Troop of 48 members.

===Malta===
Baden-Powell Scouts Malta was set up in 2011 and there are currently seven active groups located in Mtarfa, Mgarr (Sea Scouts), Luqa (Air Scouts), Qormi, St Paul&#x27;s Bay (Sea Scouts), Bahrija and Zebbug. BPSM was admitted to full membership of WFIS in 2014.

===United States===
The Baden-Powell Scout Association became a registered corporation in the United States in June 2002, and was issued federal non-profit organisation status, operating the 1st Tarrant Scout Group in Texas, notable as the first B-PSA group to operate in the United States. B-PSA was affiliated with the Baden-Powell Scouts Association of England before they ceased operations, possibly about 2010.

Also in the US is the Baden-Powell Service Association (United States) (BPSA-US), formed in 2006 and later incorporated in California, 2009. BPSA-US is not directly affiliated with the Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association, but is part of the traditional Scouting movement and a member of the World Federation of Independent Scouts. BPSA-US has worked closely with members of the Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association and the Baden-Powell Service Association in Canada, and is working with others in defining their traditional Scouting program.

<doc id="287808" wikidata="Q1495342" url="?curid=287808" title="Algebraic independence">
<text>In abstract algebra, a subset formula_1 of a field formula_2 is algebraically independent over a subfield formula_3 if the elements of formula_1 do not satisfy any non-trivial polynomial equation with coefficients in formula_3.

In particular, a one element set formula_6 is algebraically independent over formula_3 if and only if formula_8 is transcendental over formula_3. In general, all the elements of an algebraically independent set formula_1 over formula_3 are by necessity transcendental over formula_3, and over all of the field extensions over formula_3 generated by the remaining elements of formula_1.

==Example==
The real numbers formula_15 and formula_16 are transcendental numbers: they are not the roots of any nontrivial polynomial whose coefficients are rational numbers. Thus, the sets formula_17 and formula_18 are both algebraically independent over the rational numbers.

However, the set formula_19 is &quot;not&quot; algebraically independent over the rational numbers formula_20, because the nontrivial polynomial
:formula_21
is zero when formula_22 and formula_23.

==Algebraic independence of known constants==
Although  and  are transcendental, it is not known whether formula_24 is algebraically independent over formula_20. In fact, it is not even known whether formula_26 is irrational. Nesterenko proved in 1996 that:
* the numbers formula_27, formula_28, and formula_29, where formula_30 is the gamma function, are algebraically independent over formula_20;
* the numbers formula_32 and formula_33 are algebraically independent over formula_20;
* for all positive integers formula_35, the number formula_36 is algebraically independent over formula_20.

==Results and open problems==
The Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem can often be used to prove that some sets are algebraically independent over formula_20. It states that whenever formula_39 are algebraic numbers that are linearly independent over formula_20, then formula_41 are also algebraically independent over formula_20.

The Schanuel conjecture would establish the algebraic independence of many numbers, including &quot;&quot; and &quot;,&quot; but remains unproven:

:Let formula_43 be any set of formula_35 complex numbers that are linearly independent over formula_45. The field extension formula_46 has transcendence degree at least formula_35 over formula_45.

==Algebraic matroids==
Given a field extension formula_49 that is not algebraic, Zorn&#x27;s lemma can be used to show that there always exists a maximal algebraically independent subset of formula_2 over formula_3. Further, all the maximal algebraically independent subsets have the same cardinality, known as the transcendence degree of the extension.

For every finite set formula_1 of elements of formula_2, the algebraically independent subsets of formula_1 satisfy the axioms that define the independent sets of a matroid. In this matroid, the rank of a set of elements is its transcendence degree, and the flat generated by a set formula_55 of elements is the intersection of formula_2 with the field formula_57. A matroid that can be generated in this way is called an algebraic matroid. No good characterization of algebraic matroids is known, but certain matroids are known to be non-algebraic; the smallest is the Vámos matroid.

Many finite matroids may be represented by a matrix over a field formula_3, in which the matroid elements correspond to matrix columns, and a set of elements is independent if the corresponding set of columns is linearly independent. Every matroid with a linear representation of this type may also be represented as an algebraic matroid, by choosing an indeterminate for each row of the matrix, and by using the matrix coefficients within each column to assign each matroid element a linear combination of these transcendentals. The converse is false: not every algebraic matroid has a linear representation.

<text>LILO (Linux Loader) is a bootloader for Linux and was the default boot loader for most Linux distributions . Unlike loadlin, it allowed booting Linux without having DOS on the computer. As of 2009, most distributions have switched to GRUB as the default boot loader. Further development of LILO was discontinued in December 2015 along with a request by Joachim Wiedorn for potential developers.

== ELILO ==
For EFI-based PC hardware the now orphaned ELILO boot loader was developed, originally by Hewlett-Packard for IA-64 systems, but later also for standard i386 and amd64 hardware with EFI support.

On any version of Linux running on Intel-based Apple Macintosh hardware, ELILO is one of the available bootloaders.

It supports network booting using TFTP/DHCP.

<text>GNU GRUB (short for GNU GRand Unified Bootloader, commonly referred to as GRUB) is a boot loader package from the GNU Project. GRUB is the reference implementation of the Free Software Foundation&#x27;s Multiboot Specification, which provides a user the choice to boot one of multiple operating systems installed on a computer or select a specific kernel configuration available on a particular operating system&#x27;s partitions.

GNU GRUB was developed from a package called the &quot;Grand Unified Bootloader&quot; (a play on Grand Unified Theory). It is predominantly used for Unix-like systems.

==Operation==

===Booting===
When a computer is turned on, its BIOS finds the primary bootable device (usually the computer&#x27;s hard disk) and runs the initial bootstrap program from the master boot record (MBR). The MBR is the first sector of the hard disk. This bootstrap program must be small because it has to fit in a single sector. For a long time, the size of a sector has been 512 bytes. Since 2009 there are hard disks available with a sector size of 4096 bytes, called Advanced Format disks, but , such hard disks are still accessed in 512-byte sectors, using the 512e emulation.
The legacy MBR partition table supports a maximum of four partitions and occupies 64 bytes, combined. Together with the optional disk signature (four bytes) and disk timestamp (six bytes), this leaves between 434 and 446 bytes available for the machine code of a boot loader. Although such a small space can be sufficient for very simple boot loaders, it is not big enough to contain a boot loader supporting complex and multiple file systems, menu-driven selection of boot choices, etc. Boot loaders with bigger footprints are therefore split into pieces, where the smallest piece fits in the MBR, while one or more larger pieces are stored in other locations such as empty sectors between the MBR and the first partition. The code in the MBR then does little more than starting the second part.

The purpose of the remaining part(s) of the boot loader is to actually boot an operating system by configuring it and starting the kernel. Kernels are in most cases stored as files residing on appropriate file systems, but the concept of a file system is unknown to the BIOS. Thus, in BIOS-based systems, the duty of a boot loader is to access the content of those files, so it can be loaded into the RAM and executed.

One possible approach for boot loaders is to load kernel images by directly accessing hard disk sectors without understanding the underlying file system. Usually, an additional level of indirection is required, in form of &quot;maps&quot; or &quot;map files&quot; auxiliary files that contain a list of physical sectors occupied by kernel images. Such maps need to be updated each time a kernel image changes its physical location on disk, due to installing new kernel images, file system defragmentation, etc. Also, in case of the maps changing their physical location, their locations need to be updated within the boot loader&#x27;s MBR code, so the sectors indirection mechanism continues to work. This is not only cumbersome, but it also leaves the system in need of manual repairs in case something goes wrong during system updates.

Another approach is to make a boot loader aware of the underlying file systems, so kernel images are configured and accessed using their actual file paths. That requires a boot loader to contain a driver for each of the supported file systems, so they can be understood and accessed by the boot loader itself. This approach eliminates the need for hardcoded locations of hard disk sectors and existence of map files, and does not require MBR updates after kernel images are added or moved around. The configuration of a boot loader is stored in a regular file, which is also accessed in a file system-aware way to obtain boot configurations before the actual booting of any kernel images. Thus, fewer things can go wrong during system updates. As a downside, such boot loaders are larger and more complex.

GNU GRUB uses the second approach, by understanding the underlying file systems. The boot loader itself is split into multiple &quot;stages&quot; so that it fits in the MBR boot scheme.

Two major versions of GRUB are in common use: GRUB version 0, called &quot;GRUB legacy,&quot; is only prevalent in older releases of Linux distributions. &quot;GRUB 2&quot; was written from scratch and intended to replace its predecessor, and is now used by a majority of Linux distributions.

===Version 0 (GRUB Legacy)===

GRUB 0.x follows a two-stage approach. The master boot record (MBR) usually contains GRUB &quot;stage 1,&quot; or can contain a standard MBR implementation which chainloads GRUB &quot;stage 1&quot; from the active partition&#x27;s boot sector. Given the small size of a boot sector (512 bytes), &quot;stage 1&quot; can do little more than load the next stage of GRUB by loading a few disk sectors from a fixed location near the start of the disk (within its first 1024 cylinders).

&quot;Stage 1&quot; can load &quot;stage 2&quot; directly, but it is normally set up to load the &quot;stage 1.5.&quot;, located in the first 30 KiB of hard disk immediately following the MBR and before the first partition. In case this space is not available (unusual partition table, special disk drivers, GPT or LVM disk) the install of &quot;stage 1.5&quot; will fail. The &quot;stage 1.5&quot; image contains file system drivers, enabling it to directly load &quot;stage 2&quot; from any known location in the filesystem, for example from codice_1. &quot;Stage 2&quot; will then load the default configuration file and any other modules needed.

===Version 2 (GRUB 2)===
==== Startup on systems using BIOS firmware ====
* See illustration in last image on the right.
* codice_2 (stage 1) is written to the first 440 bytes of the Master Boot Record (MBR boot code in sector 0), or optionally in a partition boot sector (PBR). It addresses codice_3 by a 64-bit LBA address. The actual sector number is written by codice_4. codice_3 is the first sector of codice_6 with the sole purpose to load the rest of codice_6 identified by LBA sector numbers also written by codice_4.
** On MBR partitioned disks, codice_6 (stage 1.5) is stored in the empty sectors (if available) between the MBR and the first partition. Recent operating systems suggest a 1 MiB gap here for alignment (2047 512-byte, or 255 4KiB, sectors). This gap used to be 62 sectors (31 KiB) as a reminder of the sector number limit of Cylinder-Head-Sector (C/H/S) addressing used by BIOS before 1996, therefore codice_6 is designed to be smaller than 32 KiB.
**On GPT partitioned disks codice_6 is written to its own partition. It must be flagged &quot;BIOS_grub&quot;, must not be formatted and can be as tiny as 1 MiB.
* stage 2: codice_6 loads codice_13 from the partition configured by codice_4. If the partition index has changed, GRUB will be unable to find the codice_15, and presents the user with the GRUB Rescue prompt.
* Depending on how GRUB2 was installed, the codice_16 is either in the &quot;root&quot; partition of the Linux distribution, or in the separate &quot;/boot&quot; partition.
* after normal.mod loaded: codice_15 parses codice_18, optionally loads modules (eg. for graphical UI and file system support) and shows the menu.

==== Startup on systems using UEFI firmware ====
* codice_19 (for x64 UEFI systems) is installed as a file in the EFI System Partition, and booted by the firmware directly, without a codice_2 in MBR sector 0. This file is like stage1 and stage1.5.
* codice_16 can be installed on the EFI System Partition or the separate &quot;/boot&quot; partition, among others.
* For x64 UEFI systems, stage2 are the codice_22 file and other codice_16 files.

==== After startup ====
GRUB presents a menu where the user can choose from operating systems (OS) found by grub-install. GRUB can be configured to automatically load a specified OS after a user-defined timeout. If the timeout is set to zero seconds, pressing and holding , or in some modern GRUB versions loaded using UEFI, pressing rapidly while the computer is booting makes it possible to access the boot menu.

In the operating system selection menu GRUB accepts a couple of commands:
* By pressing , it is possible to edit kernel parameters of the selected menu item &quot;before the operating system is started&quot;. The reason for doing this in GRUB (i.e. not editing the parameters in an already booted system) can be an emergency case: the system has failed to boot. Using the kernel parameters line it is possible, among other things, to specify a module to be disabled (blacklisted) for the kernel. This could be required if the specific kernel module is broken and thus prevents boot-up. For example, to blacklist the kernel module codice_24, one could append codice_25 at the end of the kernel parameters.
* By pressing , the user enters the GRUB command line. The GRUB command line resembles GNU Bash, but only implements a subset of the line editing functions and GRUB-specific commands.

Once boot options have been selected, GRUB loads the selected kernel into memory and passes control to the kernel. Alternatively, GRUB can pass control of the boot process to another boot loader, using &quot;chain loading&quot;. This is the method used to load operating systems that do not support the Multiboot Specification or are not supported directly by GRUB.

=== Identifying partitions (UUID workaround) ===
A computer can have multiple hard disks connected to it. These could be identified via their SATA port. Each time the computer POSTs, the hard disk connected to a specific motherboard port &quot;could&quot; be assigned the same identifier, for example . But what if such consistency cannot be guaranteed? What if the constellation of connected hard disks changed from one start up to another? What if a hard disk will be connected to another computer?

By entering into either the &quot;GRUB rescue console&quot; (available after loading codice_6 ) or the &quot;GRUB console&quot; (available after loading codice_15) a list of all available hard disks and partitions can be obtained. For example, ) will show numbers that can be assigned to actual hard disks and partitions.

As it cannot be guaranteed that the &quot;codice_28style numbering of hard disks via device numbers is consistent, GNU GRUB can use a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) to identify partitions (actually file system instances).

The file systems ext2, ext3, ext4 and xfs use a UUID to uniquely identify an instance. The UUID is created when a partition is formatted. The UUID is part of the file system and written to the superblock. All operations other than formatting should leave the UUID unaltered. It is possible to change the UUID or duplicate it by using dd to clone an entire partition.

The file is used to configure GRUB. It contains commands to be executed during each start-up. Without an existing and valid , GRUB will present a prompt.

An absolute minimal might contain only the following two commands (cf. initial ramdisk):
A fancier will describe a menu to be presented, use multiple colors, and may specify a background picture.

==History==
GRUB was initially developed by Erich Boleyn as part of work on booting the operating system GNU/Hurd, developed by the Free Software Foundation. In 1999, Gordon Matzigkeit and Yoshinori K. Okuji made GRUB an official software package of the GNU Project and opened the development process to the public. , the majority of Linux distributions have adopted GNU GRUB 2.

===Development===
GRUB version 0 (also known as &quot;GRUB Legacy&quot;) is no longer under development and is being phased out. The GNU GRUB developers have switched their focus to GRUB 2, a complete rewrite with goals including making GNU GRUB cleaner, more robust, more portable and more powerful. GRUB 2 started under the name PUPA. PUPA was supported by the Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA) in Japan. PUPA was integrated into GRUB 2 development around 2002, when GRUB version 0.9x was renamed GRUB Legacy.

Some of the goals of the GRUB 2 project include support for non-x86 platforms, internationalization and localization, non-ASCII characters, dynamic modules, memory management, a scripting mini-language, migrating platform specific (x86) code to platform specific modules, and an object-oriented framework. GNU GRUB version 2.00 was officially released on June 26, 2012.

Three of the most widely used Linux distributions use GRUB 2 as their mainstream boot loader. Ubuntu adopted it as the default boot loader in its 9.10 version of October 2009. Fedora followed suit with Fedora 16 released in November 2011. OpenSUSE adopted GRUB 2 as the default boot loader with its 12.2 release of September 2012. Solaris also adopted GRUB 2 on the x86 platform in the Solaris 11.1 release. Buildroot also uses GNU GRUB for x86 and x86_64 targets.

In late 2015, the exploit of pressing backspace 28 times to bypass the login password was found and quickly fixed.

===Variants===
GNU GRUB is free software, so several variants have been created. Some notable ones, which have not been merged into GRUB mainline:
* OpenSolaris includes a modified GRUB Legacy that supports Solaris VTOC slices, automatic 64-bit kernel selection, and booting from ZFS (with compression and multiple boot environments).
* Google Summer of Code 2008 had a project to support GRUB legacy to boot from ext4 formatted partitions.
* The Syllable project made a modified version of GRUB to load the system from its AtheOS File System.
* &quot;TrustedGRUB&quot; extends GRUB by implementing verification of the system integrity and boot process security, using the Trusted Platform Module (TPM).
* The Intel BIOS Implementation Test Suite (BITS) provides a GRUB environment for testing BIOSes and in particular their initialization of Intel processors, hardware, and technologies. BITS supports scripting via Python, and includes Python APIs to access various low-level functionality of the hardware platform, including ACPI, CPU and chipset registers, PCI, and PCI Express.
* GRUB4DOS is a GRUB legacy fork that improves the installation experience on DOS and Microsoft Windows by putting everything besides the GRLDR config in one image file. It can be loaded directly from DOS, or by NTLDR or Windows Boot Manager. GRUB4DOS is under active development and as of 2021 supports UEFI.

==Utilities==

===GRUB configuration tools===
The setup tools in use by various distributions often include modules to set up GRUB. For example, YaST2 on SUSE Linux and openSUSE distributions and Anaconda on Fedora/RHEL distributions. StartUp-Manager and GRUB Customizer are graphical configuration editors for Debian-based distributions. The development of StartUp-Manager stopped on 6 May 2011 after the lead developer cited personal reasons for not actively developing the program. GRUB Customizer is also available for Arch-based distributions.

For GRUB 2 there are KDE Control Modules.

GRLDR ICE is a tiny tool for modifying the default configuration of grldr file for GRUB4DOS.

===Boot repair utilities===
 is a simple graphical tool for recovering from frequent boot-related problems with GRUB and Microsoft Windows bootloader. This application is available under GNU GPL license. Boot-Repair can repair GRUB on multiple Linux distributions including, but not limited to, Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, openSUSE, and Arch Linux.

===Installer for Windows===
 is a Windows open-source software package. It allows GNU GRUB to boot from a Windows directory. The setup program installs GNU GRUB version 2.12 to an NTFS partition. A Windows GUI application is then used to customize the GRUB boot menu, themes, UEFI boot order, scripts etc. All GNU GRUB scripts and commands are supported for both UEFI and legacy systems. Grub2Win can configure GRUB for multiboot of Windows, Ubuntu, openSuse, Fedora and many other Linux distributions. It is freely available under GNU GPL License at .

==Alternative boot managers==
The strength of GRUB is the wide range of supported platforms, file systems, and operating systems, making it the default choice for distributions and embedded systems.

However, there are boot managers targeted at the end user that give more friendly user experience, graphical OS selector and simpler configuration:
* rEFInd – Macintosh-style graphical boot manager, only for UEFI-based computers (BIOS not supported).
* CloverEFI – Macintosh-style graphical boot manager for BIOS and UEFI-based computers. It emulates UEFI with a heavily modified DUET from the TianoCore project and requires a FAT formatted partition even on BIOS systems. As a benefit, it has a basic filesystem driver in the partition boot sector, avoiding the brittleness of a second or third stage and the infamous GRUB Rescue prompt. The user interface looks similar to rEFInd: both inherit from the abandoned boot manager rEFIt.

Non-graphical alternatives:
* systemd-boot – Light, UEFI-only boot manager with text-based OS selector menu.

<doc id="287821" wikidata="Q720681" url="?curid=287821" title="Malcolm Muggeridge">
<text>Thomas Malcolm Muggeridge (24 March 1903 – 14 November 1990) was a British journalist and satirist. His father, H. T. Muggeridge, was a socialist politician and one of the early Labour Party Members of Parliament (for Romford, in Essex). Malcolm&#x27;s brother Eric was one of the founders of Plan International. In his twenties, Muggeridge was attracted to communism and went to live in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, and the experience turned him into an anti-communist.

During World War II, he worked for the British government as a soldier and a spy, first in East Africa for two years and then in Paris. In the aftermath of the war, he converted to Christianity under the influence of Hugh Kingsmill and helped to bring Mother Teresa to popular attention in the West. He was a critic of the sexual revolution and of drug use.

Muggeridge kept detailed diaries for much of his life, which were published in 1981 under the title &quot;Like It Was: The Diaries of Malcolm Muggeridge&quot;, and he developed them into two volumes of an uncompleted autobiography &quot;Chronicles of Wasted Time&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Muggeridge&#x27;s father, Henry (known as H. T. Muggeridge), served as a Labour Party councillor in the local government of Croydon, South London, as a founder-member of the Fabian Society, and as a Labour Member of Parliament for Romford (1929–1931) during Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s second Labour government. Muggeridge&#x27;s biographer Richard Ingrams described H.T. as &quot;a small bearded man with a large frame, a twinkling eye, and a rather bulbous nose which he passed on to his son.&quot; Muggeridge&#x27;s mother was Annie Booler.

The middle of five brothers, Muggeridge was born in Sanderstead, Surrey. His first name, Thomas, was chosen by H.T. in honor of his hero Thomas Carlyle. He grew up in Croydon and attended Selhurst Grammar School there and then Selwyn College, Cambridge, for four years. Still a student, he taught for brief periods in 1920, 1922 and 1924 at the John Ruskin Central School, Croydon, where his father was Chairman of the Governors. After graduating in 1924 with a pass degree in natural sciences, he went to British India for three years to teach English literature at Union Christian College, Aluva, Kingdom of Cochin. His writing career began during his time in the Kingdom via an exchange of correspondence on war and peace with Mahatma Gandhi, with Muggeridge&#x27;s article on the interactions being published in &quot;Young India&quot;, a local magazine.

Returning to Britain in 1927, he married Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Dobbs (1903–1994), the daughter of Rosalind Dobbs (a younger sister of Beatrice Webb). He worked as a supply teacher before moving to teach English literature in Egypt six months later. There he met Arthur Ransome, who was visiting Egypt as a journalist for the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;. Ransome recommended Muggeridge to the newspaper&#x27;s editors, who offered Muggeridge his first position in journalism.

==Moscow==
Initially attracted by communism, Muggeridge and his wife travelled to Moscow in 1932. He was to be a correspondent for the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; standing in for William Henry Chamberlin, who was about to take a leave of absence. During Muggeridge&#x27;s early time in Moscow he was completing a novel, &quot;Picture Palace&quot;, loosely based on his experiences and observations at the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;. It was completed and submitted to publishers in January 1933, but there was concern by the publishers over potential libel claims, and the published book was not distributed. Very few first-edition copies exist today. That setback caused considerable financial difficulties for Muggeridge, who was not employed and was paid only for articles that were accepted.

Increasingly disillusioned by his close observation of communism in practice, Muggeridge decided to investigate reports of the famine in Ukraine by travelling there and to the Caucasus without first obtaining the permission of the Soviet authorities. The revealing reports that he sent back to &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; in the diplomatic bag, thus evading censorship, were not fully printed, and those that were published (on 25, 27 and 28 March 1933) were not published under Muggeridge&#x27;s name. Meanwhile, fellow journalist Gareth Jones, who had met Muggeridge in Moscow, published his own stories. The two accounts helped to confirm the extent of a forced famine, which was politically motivated. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; Walter Duranty denied the existence of any famine. Jones wrote letters to the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; in support of Muggeridge&#x27;s articles about the famine.

Having come into conflict with British newspapers&#x27; editorial policy of not provoking the authorities in the Soviet Union, Muggeridge returned to novel writing. He wrote &quot;Winter in Moscow&quot; (1934), which describes conditions in the &quot;socialist utopia&quot; and satirised Western journalists&#x27; uncritical view of the Soviet regime. He was later to call Duranty &quot;the greatest liar I have met in journalism&quot;. Later, he began a writing partnership with Hugh Kingsmill. Muggeridge&#x27;s politics changed from an independent socialist point of view to a conservative religious stance. He wrote later:

==Return to India==
After his time in Moscow, Muggeridge worked on other newspapers, including &quot;The Statesman&quot; in Calcutta, of which he was editor in 1934 to 1936. In his second stint in India, he lived by himself in Calcutta, having left behind his wife and children in London. Between 1930 and 1936, the Muggeridges had three sons and a daughter. His office was in the headquarters of the newspaper in Chowringhee.

==Second World War==
When war was declared, Muggeridge, now aged 36, went to Maidstone to join up but was sent away as too old: &quot;My generation felt they&#x27;d missed the First War, now was the time to &quot;make up&quot;.&quot; He was called into the Ministry of Information, which he called &quot;a most appalling set-up&quot;, and joined the army as a private. He joined the Corps of Military Police and was commissioned on the General List in May 1940. He transferred to the Intelligence Corps as a lieutenant in June 1942. Having spent two years as a Regimental Intelligence Officer in Britain, he was in 1942 recruited by MI6 and was posted to Lourenço Marques, the capital of Mozambique, as a bogus vice-consul (called a Special Correspondent by London Controlling Section). Before heading out, Muggeridge stayed in Lisbon for some months, waiting for his visa to come through. He stayed in Estoril at the Pensão Royal on 17 May 1942.

His mission was to prevent information about Allied convoys off the coast of Africa falling into enemy hands. He wrote later that he also attempted suicide. After the Allied occupation of North Africa, he was posted to Algiers as liaison officer with the French &quot;sécurité militaire&quot;. At the time of the liberation, in that capacity, he was sent to Paris and worked alongside Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French Forces. He had a high regard for de Gaulle and considered him a greater man than Churchill. He was warned to expect some anti-British feeling in Paris because of the attack on Mers-el-Kébir. In fact, Muggeridge, speaking on the BBC retrospective programme &quot;Muggeridge: Ancient &amp; Modern&quot;, said that he had encountered no such feeling and indeed had been allowed on occasion to eat and drink for nothing at Maxim&#x27;s. He was assigned to make an initial investigation into P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s five broadcasts from Berlin during the war. Though he was prepared to dislike Wodehouse, the interview became the start of a lifelong friendship and publishing relationship as well as the subject for several plays. He also interviewed Coco Chanel in Paris about the nature of her involvement with the Nazis in Vichy France during the war. Muggeridge ended the war as a major, having received the Croix de Guerre from the French government for undisclosed reasons.

==Later life==
Muggeridge wrote for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and also for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; where he was appointed deputy editor in 1950. He kept detailed diaries, which provide a vivid picture of the journalistic and political London of the day, including regular contact with George Orwell, Anthony Powell, Graham Greene and Bill Deedes; and he comments perceptively on Ian Fleming, Guy Burgess and Kim Philby.

When George Orwell died in 1950, Muggeridge and Anthony Powell organized Orwell&#x27;s funeral.

Muggeridge also acted as Washington correspondent for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He was editor of &quot;Punch&quot; magazine from 1953 to 1957, a challenging appointment for one who claimed that &quot;there is no occupation more wretched than trying to make the English laugh&quot;. One of his first acts was to sack the illustrator E. H. Shepard. In 1957, he received public and professional opprobrium for criticism of the British monarchy in a US magazine, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. The article was given the title &quot;Does England Really Need a Queen?&quot;, and its publication was delayed by five months to coincide with the Royal State Visit to Washington, DC taking place later that year. It was little more than a rehash of views expressed in a 1955 article, &quot;Royal Soap Opera&quot;, but its timing caused outrage in the UK, and a contract with Beaverbrook Newspapers was cancelled. His notoriety then propelled him into becoming better known as a broadcaster, with regular appearances on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot;, and a reputation as a tough interviewer. Encounters with Brendan Behan and Salvador Dalí cemented his reputation as a fearless critic of modern life.

Muggeridge was described as having predatory behaviour towards women during his BBC years. He was described as a &quot;compulsive groper&quot;, reportedly being nicknamed &quot;The Pouncer&quot; and as &quot;a man fully deserving of the acronym NSIT—not safe in taxis&quot;. His niece confirmed these reports, while also reflecting on the suffering inflicted on his family and saying that he changed his behaviour when he converted to Christianity in the 1960s.

In the early 1960s, Muggeridge became a vegetarian so that he would be &quot;free to denounce those horrible factory farms where animals are raised for food&quot;.

He took to frequently denouncing the new sexual laxity of the Swinging Sixties on radio and television. He particularly railed against &quot;pills and pot&quot;: birth control pills and cannabis.

In contrast, he met the Beatles before they were famous: On 7 June 1961 he flew to Hamburg for an interview with the &quot;Stern&quot; magazine and afterwards went out on the town and ended up at the Top Ten Club on the Reeperbahn. In his diary, he described their performance as &quot;bashing their instruments, and emitting nerveless sounds into microphones&quot;. However, they recognised him from the television and they entered into conversation. He acknowledged that &quot;their faces [were] like Renaissance carvings of the saints or Blessed Virgins&quot;.

His book, &quot;Tread Softly for You Tread on My Jokes&quot; (1966), though acerbic in its wit, revealed a serious view of life. The title is an allusion to the last line of the poem &quot;Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven&quot; by William Butler Yeats: &quot;Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.&quot; In 1967, he preached at Great St Mary&#x27;s, Cambridge, and again in 1970.

Having been elected Rector of Edinburgh University, Muggeridge was goaded by the editor of &quot;The Student&quot;, Anna Coote, to support the call for contraceptive pills to be available at the University Health Centre. He used a sermon at St Giles&#x27; Cathedral in January 1968 to resign the post to protest against the Students&#x27; Representative Council&#x27;s views on &quot;pot and pills&quot;. The sermon was published under the title &quot;Another King&quot;.

Muggeridge resigned as a judge for the 1971 Booker Prize because of his &quot;general lack of sympathy with entries for this year&#x27;s Booker Prize&quot; and was replaced on the panel by Philip Toynbee.

Muggeridge was also known for his wit and profound writings often at odds with the opinions of the day. &quot;Never forget that only dead fish swim with the stream&quot;, he liked to quote. He wrote two volumes of an autobiography called &quot;Chronicles of Wasted Time&quot; (the title is a quotation from Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnet 106). The first volume (1972) was &quot;The Green Stick&quot;. The second volume (1973) was &quot;The Infernal Grove&quot;. A projected third volume, &quot;The Right Eye&quot;, covering the postwar period, was never completed.

===Conversion to Christianity===
Agnostic for most of his life, Muggeridge became a Protestant Christian, publishing &quot;Jesus Rediscovered&quot; in 1969, a collection of essays, articles and sermons on faith, which became a best seller. &quot;Jesus: The Man Who Lives&quot; followed in 1976, which was a more substantial work describing the gospel in his own words. In &quot;A Third Testament&quot;, he profiles seven spiritual thinkers, whom he called &quot;God&#x27;s Spies&quot;, who influenced his life: Augustine of Hippo, William Blake, Blaise Pascal, Leo Tolstoy, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Søren Kierkegaard, and Fyodor Dostoevsky. He also produced several BBC religious documentaries, including &quot;In the Footsteps of St. Paul&quot;.

Muggeridge became a leading figure in the Nationwide Festival of Light in 1971 protesting against the commercial exploitation of sex and violence in Britain and advocating the teaching of Christ as the key to recovering moral stability in the nation. He said at the time: &quot;The media today—press, television, and radio—are largely in the hands of those who favour the present Gadarene slide into decadence and Godlessness.&quot;

===Criticism of &quot;Life of Brian&quot;===
In 1979, along with Mervyn Stockwood, the Bishop of Southwark, Muggeridge appeared on the chat show &quot;Friday Night, Saturday Morning&quot; to discuss the film &quot;Life of Brian&quot; with Monty Python members John Cleese and Michael Palin. Although the Python members gave reasons that they believed the film to be neither anti-Christian nor mocking the person of Jesus, both Muggeridge and the bishop insisted that they were being disingenuous and that the film was anti-Christian and blasphemous. Muggeridge further declared their film to be &quot;buffoonery&quot;, &quot;tenth-rate&quot;, &quot;this miserable little film&quot; and &quot;this little squalid number&quot;. Furthermore, Muggeridge stated that there was &quot;nothing in this film that could possibly destroy anybody&#x27;s genuine faith&quot;; in saying this, the Pythons were quick to point out the futility of criticising it so vitriolically since Muggeridge did not think it was significant enough to affect anyone. According to Palin, Muggeridge arrived late for the film and missed the two scenes in which Jesus and Brian were distinguished as different people. The discussion was moderated by Tim Rice, the lyricist for the musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, which had also generated some controversy in Britain about a decade earlier over its depiction of Jesus.

The comedians later expressed disappointment in Muggeridge, whom all in Monty Python had previously respected as a satirist. Cleese said that his reputation had &quot;plummeted&quot; in his eyes, and Palin commented, &quot;He was just being Muggeridge, preferring to have a very strong contrary opinion as opposed to none at all&quot;.

===Later years===
In 1982, at 79, Muggeridge was received into the Catholic Church after he had rejected Anglicanism, like his wife, Kitty. This was largely under the influence of Mother Teresa about whom he had written a book, &quot;Something Beautiful for God&quot;, setting out and interpreting her life. His last book, &quot;Conversion&quot; (1988), describes his life as a 20th century pilgrimage, a spiritual journey.

Muggeridge died on 14 November 1990 in a nursing home in Hastings, England, at the age of 87. He had suffered a stroke three years earlier.

==Legacy==
An eponymous literary society was established on 24 March 2003, the occasion of his centenary, and it publishes a quarterly newsletter, &quot;The Gargoyle&quot;. The Malcolm Muggeridge Society, based in Britain, is progressively republishing his works. Muggeridge&#x27;s papers are in the Special Collections at Wheaton College, Illinois, US.

In November 2008, on the 75th anniversary of the Ukraine famine, both Muggeridge and Gareth Jones were posthumously awarded the Ukrainian Order of Merit III Class to mark their exceptional services to the country and its people.

In an interview on the Eric Metaxas Radio Show, notable Christian apologist Ravi Zacharias identified Malcolm Muggeridge and G. K. Chesterton as two important influencers in his life.

A week following Muggeridge&#x27;s death, William F. Buckley wrote a tribute published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Buckley, in an interview on C-SPAN, described Muggeridge as &quot;a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful man, a great wit and a brilliant, brilliant analyst.&quot;

<text>The 1958 Lebanon crisis was a political crisis in Lebanon caused by political and religious tensions in the country that included an American military intervention, which lasted for around three months until President Camille Chamoun, who had requested the assistance, completed his term as president of Lebanon. American and Lebanese government forces occupied the Port of Beirut and Beirut International Airport. With the crisis over, the United States withdrew.

==Background==
=== Arab Cold War ===

After the end of World War II in 1945, the United States and Soviet Union were the two major world powers. Two years later, the Truman Doctrine was issued, aimed at containing the spread of communism and the Soviet Union. The Cold War is generally considered to have begun around this time. As the world divided into the Eastern (communist) and Western (capitalist) Blocs, a struggle for ideological geopolitical supremacy between the US and USSR emerged. One of the ways it manifested was through proxy wars in various global regions. One of those regions was the Middle East, where the Arab Cold War took place. After the Suez Crisis in 1956, there was an increase in Arab hostility to the West as well as increased Soviet influence in Egypt and Syria. The crisis also encouraged pan-Arabism and increased the popularity and influence of Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt. The United States feared that the region was susceptible to the spread of communism.

The Eisenhower Doctrine was announced by President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower in January 1957. It pledged American economic and military aid to prevent communism from spreading in the Middle East. The United States Congress passed the doctrine on 7 March and it was signed into law on 9 March. James P. Richards began to tour the Middle East and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and United States European Command began to make plans for intervention in the region. Their plan centered around the United States Sixth Fleet, stationed in the Mediterranean Sea, the Middle East Force and several Air Force units. 11,000 soldiers were made ready for combat in the region. While the doctrine was never formally invoked, the US supported Hussein of Jordan in 1957 against an alleged coup attempt and moved to prevent communism from spreading in Syria.

===Situation in Lebanon===
The partition of the Ottoman Empire divided present-day Syria and Lebanon under the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon in 1923. Lebanon completely became an independent nation on 22 November 1943 when the French Mandate formally ended. Around the time of independence, the National Pact was agreed upon, stating that, among other things, &quot;Lebanon was to be a completely independent sovereign state. The Christians were to forego seeking foreign [...] protection or attempting to bring Lebanon under foreign control or influence. In return, the Muslims were to forego making any attempt to bring Lebanon into any political union with Syria, or into the formation of any Arab Union&quot;. The Pact marked a compromise between several religious sects living in the country—namely Maronite Christians, Sunni Muslims, Shia Muslims, Greek Orthodox Christians, Greek Catholic Christians and Druzes.

Camille Chamoun was elected as the second President of Lebanon in the presidential elections in 1952, replacing Bechara El Khoury in the post. Described as &quot;quite openly anti-Communist&quot;, the United States viewed Chamoun as &quot;definitely our friend.&quot; In 1956, Prime Minister Abdallah El-Yafi and Minister of State Saeb Salam resigned in protest due to Chamoun&#x27;s refusal to condemn the British-French invasion of Egypt during the Suez Crisis. This caused Muslim opposition groups to form the United National Front in 1957. The United States agreed to provide military assistance to the Lebanese government from 6 June 1957.

In 1957, shortly after the announcement of the Eisenhower Doctrine—which Chamoun&#x27;s regime had been the only Arab government to openly endorse &quot;without reservation&quot;—the United States became concerned that parliamentary elections set for June would result in the election of a parliament that was hostile to the US. Many Muslims in the nation supported Nasser and the United Arab Republic (UAR). Kamal Jumblatt and Rashid Karami, Druze and Sunni leaders, respectively, condemned Chamoun&#x27;s support for the doctrine as violating the National Pact. US attempts to influence the election included approving the sending of $12.7 million in military or financial aid and sending operatives from the Central Intelligence Agency (including David Atlee Phillips, Miles Copeland Jr. and Wilbur Eveland) to the region, who provided &quot;campaign contributions&quot; towards pro-West politicians. In late May 1957 pro-Chamoun troops killed seven and wounded seventy-three protesters in Beirut and the following month opposition leaders argued that Chamoun &quot;had bought so many votes and gerrymandered so many districts that the balloting would be meaningless.&quot; The election was an American success, as fifty-three out of sixty-six parliamentarians supported Chamoun. The US continued to provide aid to Chamoun, fearing Soviet and UAR influence in the region. Chamun&#x27;s opponents maintained that the election was invalid and needed to be re-held.

On 8 May 1958 a Lebanese journalist, Nasib Al Matni, was assassinated in his office in Beirut. He was a pro-Nasserist and anti-Chamoun Maronite. Following this incident intensive protests occurred in Beirut and Tripoli. 

In 1958, Camille Chamoun was in the sixth and final year of his term as President of Lebanon.

=== Heightened tensions ===
On 1 February 1958, Syria and Egypt united, forming the UAR. The United States feared initially that the new nation would become the dominant power in the Middle East, but recognized it on 25 February after deciding that the UAR could be beneficial in halting communism&#x27;s spread and keeping Nasser contained. Chamoun and Charles Malik worried that &quot;the peril of subversion in Lebanon&quot; by the UAR &quot;was immediate&quot; and asked for American aid.

Tensions were increasing in Lebanon throughout early 1958. Although Chamoun&#x27;s term would have expired on 23 September 1958, he intended to run for president again, which was not permitted in the Constitution of Lebanon, and asked for American support in his effort. While the United States feared that a movement against Chamoun could harm their interests in the region, they were reluctant to withdraw support for him, as Fouad Chehab, the chief of staff of the Lebanese Army, was the most likely figure to succeed Chamoun. Robert M. McClintock, American ambassador to Lebanon, described Chehab as &quot;a neutral legume who would require careful pruning to grow in the right direction.&quot; As a result, the US did not formally support Chamoun&#x27;s effort.

Protests by various groups—mainly the Sunnis and the Druzes—began in February against the Christian Chamoun, who had also aligned himself in support of the US and Britain, actions that protesters considered breaches of the National Pact. Demonstrations also protested that Chamoun had not allowed Lebanon to join the UAR. The protesters felt that &quot;Chamoun was not willing to modify his foreign policy unless he was forced to.&quot; Tensions between Maronite Christians and Arab Muslims continued to rise after the killing of Nasib Al Matni on 8 May. Matni was the editor of &quot;Al Telegraf&quot; and had been critical of Chamoun&#x27;s rule. Fighting erupted on the streets of Beirut as a Muslim mob burned the US Information Service library down. Heightened tensions existed around the country, including in the Beqaa Valley, where Shia militants were receiving weapons from Syria. &quot;The New York Times&quot; dated the beginning of a formal armed rebellion to 10 May 1958. Chamoun requested American military intervention in early May against the threat to his power under the Eisenhower Doctrine, although McClintock noted that there was an &quot;absence of overt Communist aggression&quot;.

The leader of the UAR, Nasser, began publicly calling for Arab unity. Various nations, including Lebanon, blamed Nasser&#x27;s actions for the increase in sectarian unrest, and the Lebanese government filed a formal complaint to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on 22 May 1958, accusing the UAR of meddling in the nation&#x27;s affairs. The UNSC passed a resolution on 11 June 1958 that recommended sending a group to Lebanon &quot;to ensure that there is no illegal infiltration of personnel or supply of arms or other material across the Lebanese borders&quot;. A &quot;Group of Three&quot;—Galo Plaza, Rajeshwar Dayal and Odd Bull—Dag Hammarskjöld, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and members of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization were soon dispatched to Lebanon to form the United Nations Observation Group in Lebanon (UNOGIL).

==Operation Blue Bat==
Eisenhower responded by authorizing the American military intervention Operation Blue Bat on 15 July 1958, in the first application of the Eisenhower Doctrine in which the U.S. announced that it would intervene to protect regimes that it considered to be threatened by international communism. The goal of the operation was to bolster Chamoun&#x27;s pro-Western Lebanese government from internal opposition and threats from Syria and Egypt. The plan was to occupy and secure Beirut International Airport, a few miles south of the city, and then to secure the port of Beirut and the approaches to the city.

The chain of command for Operation Blue Bat was as follows: the Eisenhower administration at the strategic level; Specified Command, Middle East (SPECCOMME, a &#x27;double-hat&#x27; for Commander in Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean) at the operational level; the U.S. Sixth Fleet, with aircraft carriers , and , cruisers and , and two destroyer squadrons, including the USS The Sullivans DD-537, , and the . At the end of June, &quot;Essex&quot; and &quot;Boston&quot; were anchored at Piraeus, Greece, while &quot;Des Moines&quot;, from which Vice Admiral Charles R. Brown was flying his flag, was at Villefranche-sur-Mer, France. Land forces included the 2nd Provisional Marine Force (Task Force 62) and the United States Army Task Force 201 at the tactical level. Each of these three components influenced Operations Plan 215-58 and its execution.
The operation involved more than 14,000 men, including 8,509 US Army personnel, a contingent from the 1st Airborne Battle Group, 187th Infantry from the 24th Infantry Division and 5,670 officers and men of the United States Marine Corps (the 2nd Provisional Marine Force, of Battalion Landing Teams 1st Battalion, 8th Marines and 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines under Brigadier General Sidney S. Wade). The 2nd Battalion, 8th Marines arrived on 16 July after a 54-hour airlift from Cherry Point, North Carolina. They were supported by a fleet of 70 ships and 40,000 sailors. On 16 July 1958, Admiral James L. Holloway Jr., CINCNELM and CINCSPECCOMME, flew in from London to Beirut airport and boarded from which he commanded the remainder of the operation. The US withdrew its forces on 25 October 1958.

Eisenhower sent the diplomat Robert Daniel Murphy to Lebanon as his personal representative. Murphy played a significant role in convincing both sides of the conflict to reach a compromise by electing the moderate Christian general Fouad Chehab as incoming president, but allowing Chamoun to continue in power until the end of his term, on 22 September.

Lebanese Prime Minister Rashid Karami formed a national reconciliation government after the end of the 1958 crisis.

<text>Emanuel Shinwell, Baron Shinwell, (18 October 1884 – 8 May 1986) was a British politician who served as a government minister under Ramsay MacDonald and Clement Attlee. A member of the Labour Party, he served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for 40 years, representing Linlithgowshire, Seaham and Easington.

Born in the East End of London to a large family of Jewish immigrants, Shinwell moved to Glasgow as a boy and left school at the age of eleven. He became a trade union organiser and one of the leading figures of Red Clydeside. He was imprisoned in 1919 for his alleged involvement in the disturbances in Glasgow in January of that year. He served as a Labour MP from 1922 to 1924, and from a by-election in 1928 until 1931, and held junior office in the minority Labour Governments of 1924 and 1929–1931. He returned to the House of Commons in 1935, defeating former UK Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, who by that time had been expelled from the Labour Party. During the Second World War, he was a leading backbencher critic of the Coalition Government.

Shinwell is perhaps best remembered as the Minister of Fuel and Power in the Attlee ministry that nationalised coal mining in 1946. He was in charge of Britain&#x27;s coal supply during the extremely harsh winter of January to March 1947, during which the supply system collapsed, leaving the United Kingdom to freeze and close down. He became unpopular with the public and was sacked in October 1947. He then served as Secretary of State for War, and then as Minister of Defence from 1950 to 1951. The high defence spending which he demanded, partly to pay for British involvement in the Korean War, was a major factor causing then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Gaitskell to impose NHS charges, prompting the resignation of Aneurin Bevan from the Cabinet.

Following Labour&#x27;s defeat in 1951, Shinwell continued to serve in the Shadow Cabinet in Opposition until he stepped down in 1955. Thereafter he was a senior backbencher until 1970, by which time he was in his mid-eighties. That year he accepted a life peerage and was an active member of the House of Lords until shortly before his death, aged 101, in 1986.

==Early life, career and trade union activities==
Shinwell was born in Spitalfields, London, but his family moved to Glasgow, Scotland. His father was a Polish Jew who had a small clothing shop, and his mother, a Dutch Jew, was a cook from London. He was the eldest of thirteen children.

He educated himself in a public library and at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery. He enjoyed sport, particularly boxing, and he was the trainer of a local football team. He left school at age eleven to be apprenticed as a tailor, and began his working life as a machinist in a clothing workshop. In 1903, he became active in the Amalgamated Union of Clothiers&#x27; Operatives, and joined the Glasgow Trades Council in 1906 as a delegate of that union.

In May 1911, he was seconded to help organise the seamen of Glasgow at the request of Havelock Wilson of the National Sailors&#x27; and Firemen&#x27;s Union (NSFU). He played a prominent role in the six-week Glasgow seamen&#x27;s strike which began on 14 June and which was part of a nationwide strike. He subsequently became the secretary of the Glasgow branch of the NSFU. In August 1912, he participated in a revolt against the union, which resulted in the Glasgow branch becoming part of the Southampton-based British Seafarers&#x27; Union (BSU). He was the local secretary of the BSU until it became part of the Amalgamated Marine Workers&#x27; Union (AMWU) in 1922, after which he served as National Organiser of the new organisation.
In 1918, he stood unsuccessfully for Linlithgowshire (alternative name West Lothian).

In 1919, he gained national notoriety through his involvement in the Glasgow 40 Hours&#x27; Movement. This movement culminated in clashes between police and protesters in Glasgow&#x27;s George Square in January 1919, in which he was alleged to have been involved. He was afterwards tried for incitement to riot and was sentenced to five months&#x27; imprisonment in Calton Jail, Edinburgh.

==Political career==
===Interwar and World War Two===

An Independent Labour Party (ILP) member, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Linlithgowshire at the 1922 general election.

In 1924 he was Secretary for Mines (not a Cabinet-level post) in the First Labour Government. He lost his seat in 1924, but was re-elected for Linlithgowshire at a by-election in 1928.

In the second Labour Government of 1929–31 Ramsay MacDonald appointed him Financial Secretary to the War Office (1929–30); Cowling says that MacDonald believed he had rescued Shinwell&#x27;s ministerial career when no minister would take him. He then served again as Secretary for Mines from 1930 to 1931. At the time Shinwell was an admirer of MacDonald and tried to dissuade him from forming a National Government in 1931. He again lost his seat at the general election that year.

He returned to the Commons in 1935 after defeating MacDonald for Seaham Harbour, County of Durham (later renamed Easington after boundary changes in the late 1940s).

He campaigned vigorously, along with left-wingers such as Aneurin Bevan, for Britain to support the Popular Front government in Spain against Franco in the Spanish Civil War. On 4 April 1938, he doggedly criticised the government&#x27;s foreign policy during a heated House of Commons debate. Eventually, Conservative MP Commander Robert Tatton Bower became exasperated and shouted at him to &quot;go back to Poland!&quot;. Shinwell took this to be an anti-semitic remark and struck Bower on the side of the head causing internal bleeding, a blood clot, and a burst left eardrum. Both men then apologized to each other. 

In May 1940 Shinwell refused a position in Winston Churchill&#x27;s Coalition Government in the Ministry of Food. He thought the offer of the Food post a “bloody insult”. He became chairman of the Labour Party in 1942. During the Second World War he was a vigorous but patriotic backbench critic of Churchill. He and Earl Winterton, another serial critic of the government, were known as &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;.

===Attlee Governments: 1945–51===
====Minister of Fuel and Power====
He served in Clement Attlee&#x27;s Cabinet after the Labour victory in 1945 as Minister of Fuel and Power, and in 1946 he presided over the nationalisation of the mining industry. He also negotiated a miners&#x27; charter with the NUM. He declared the middle class &quot;not worth a tinker&#x27;s cuss&quot;. His insistence on the open-cast mining of the park of the Wentworth Woodhouse estate, to the doorsteps of the house, when the quality of the coal was poor, was viewed by its owners and the local mining community, which opposed it, as pure vindictiveness – an act of class warfare. In 1947-8 he was Chairman of the Labour Party.

In 1947, Britain experienced, in an exceptionally severe winter, a serious coal shortage. The supply system collapsed, leaving Britain to freeze and close down. Shinwell denied there were problems and refused to assume responsibility, blaming the climate, the railway system, or capitalism generally. Shinwell was widely criticised for his failure to avert this crisis. His earlier comment that &quot;There will be no fuel crisis. I am Minister of Fuel and Power and I ought to know&quot;, was later included in the official handbook for Conservative Party members to use in speeches and leaflets.

In 1947 Shinwell presided over the nationalisation of electricity. In October 1947 he was sacked. He was bitterly resentful at being replaced by Hugh Gaitskell, his former deputy and a public schoolboy. He was also attacked by James Callaghan (then a junior minister) for his lack of zeal about further nationalisation.

====Secretary of State for War====
Shinwell was demoted to Secretary of State for War (Minister for the Army, but no longer a full member of the Cabinet) a position which he held until 1950. He was a vigorous War Minister, who got on well with the Army and was seen as jingoistic.

In November 1947 a report from MI5 alleged that Shinwell had passed secret information to a man named &quot;Stanley&quot;, who had passed it on to Zionist paramilitary group, the Irgun. Shinwell knew self-styled &quot;contact man&quot; Sidney Stanley, whom he had approached for help in finding employment for his son Ernie, and Stanley had obtained information on the disbandment of the Transjordan Frontier Force from some government source.

====Minister of Defence====
Shinwell&#x27;s seat became Easington at the February 1950 election, after which he was promoted to Minister of Defence and became a full member of the Cabinet once more. Edmund Dell described him as &quot;putty in the hands of the defence chiefs&quot; and his promotion as &quot;[a] ludicrous appointment. No failure was ever great enough to persuade Attlee to deny one of his cohorts new opportunities to do damage … Shinwell never forgave Gaitskell, whom he blamed for his disgrace.&quot; Gaitskell, promoted to Chancellor of the Exchequer later in the year, recorded in his diary that Shinwell &quot;never loses an opportunity of picking a quarrel with me, sometimes on the most ridiculous grounds&quot;.

His term of office saw the Malayan Emergency and the early stages of Korean War, which began in June 1950 and to which British troops were deployed. Shinwell was responsible for the rearmament programme which precipitated the resignation of Aneurin Bevan from the Cabinet in the spring of 1951, although Gaitskell actually gave him less defence spending than he wanted. In the summer of 1951 the Cabinet blocked him from sending British troops to Abadan when the oil refineries were nationalised by the Iranian government.

Shinwell was by now seen as being on the right of the Labour Party. At the Labour Party Conference at Scarborough that autumn, he lost his place as an elected constituency representative on the Labour Party National Executive Committee (NEC), the members of which were increasingly elected by Bevanites in the constituency parties. Labour lost the general election a month later.

===Later political career===
Shinwell stepped down from the Shadow Cabinet (which at that time was elected by Labour MPs when the party was in opposition) in 1955. That year he published a volume of memoirs, &quot;Conflict Without Malice&quot;. By the early 1960s he had changed his mind about nuclear weapons and opposed the deployment of US nuclear submarines to Holy Loch.

Shinwell did not resume ministerial office when Labour returned to power in October 1964, but instead the new Prime Minister Harold Wilson appointed him Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, and during the 1964-6 Parliament he worked hard to drum up backbench support for the government, which had a very narrow majority. He was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1965 Birthday Honours. He was vehemently opposed to Wilson&#x27;s attempt to enter the EEC in 1966, and resigned as Chairman of the Labour Party in 1967.

He got on well both with Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and with the journalist Sir John Junor.

Shinwell was created a life peer as Baron Shinwell, of Easington in the County of Durham, on 29 June 1970. He later became chair of the All-Party Lords Defence Study Group. In 1973 he published another volume of memoirs, &quot;I&#x27;ve Lived through It All&quot;. He voted against the Labour Government in 1976. He resigned the Labour Party whip in 1982 in protest at left wing militancy.

==Death==
In October 1984 Shinwell celebrated his hundredth birthday against the backdrop of the miners&#x27; strike. He continued to be active in the House of Lords until shortly before his death. He became the longest-lived peer on 26 March 1986, dying a little over a month later on 8 May, aged 101. He held the record for the second longest-lived British MP (after Theodore Cooke Taylor) until overtaken by Bert Hazell in November 2008.

Shinwell&#x27;s estate was valued for probate at £271,509 (around £800,000 at 2023 prices).

==Personal life==
Shinwell was married three times: from 1903 to 1954 to Fay (Fanny) Freeman, by whom he had two sons and a daughter, from 1956 to 1971 to Dinah Meyer, who was Danish, and from 1972 to 1977 to Sarah Sturgo. He outlived all three of his wives. Shinwell&#x27;s great-niece is the former MP for Liverpool Wavertree, Luciana Berger.

Shinwell sat for sculptor Alan Thornhill for a portrait in clay. The correspondence file relating to the Shinwell portrait bust is held as part of the Thornhill Papers (2006:56) in the archive of the Henry Moore Foundation&#x27;s Henry Moore Institute in Leeds and the terracotta remains in the collection of the artist. A bronze (accession number S.309) was purchased for the Collection of Glasgow City Art Gallery in 1973.

Shinwell was a lifelong smoker, having smoked tobacco from the age of 13; on many occasions he was seen smoking with his pipe. Shinwell was also an enthusiastic drinker of spirits, particularly whisky.

<text>In mathematics, the upper half-plane, is the set of points in the Cartesian plane with The lower half-plane is the set of points with instead. Arbitrary oriented half-planes can be obtained via a planar rotation. Half-planes are an example of two-dimensional half-space. A half-plane can be split in two quadrants.

==Affine geometry==
The affine transformations of the upper half-plane include
# shifts formula_1, formula_2, and
# dilations formula_3, formula_4

Proposition: Let and be semicircles in the upper half-plane with centers on the boundary. Then there is an affine mapping that takes 
formula_5 to formula_6.
:Proof: First shift the center of to Then take formula_7 
and dilate. Then shift to the center of 

==Inversive geometry==

Definition: formula_8.

 can be recognized as the circle of radius centered at and as the polar plot of formula_9

Proposition: in and are collinear points.

In fact, formula_10 is the inversion of the line formula_11 in the unit circle. Indeed, the diagonal from to has squared length formula_12, so that formula_13 
is the reciprocal of that length.

==Metric geometry==
The distance between any two points and in the upper half-plane can be consistently defined as follows: The perpendicular bisector of the segment from to either intersects the boundary or is parallel to it. In the latter case and lie on a ray perpendicular to the boundary and logarithmic measure can be used to define a distance that is invariant under dilation. In the former case and lie on a circle centered at the intersection of their perpendicular bisector and the boundary. By the above proposition this circle can be moved by affine motion to 
 Distances on can be defined using the correspondence with points on formula_14 and logarithmic measure on this ray. In consequence, the upper half-plane becomes a metric space. The generic name of this metric space is the hyperbolic plane. In terms of the models of hyperbolic geometry, this model is frequently designated the Poincaré half-plane model.

==Complex plane==
Mathematicians sometimes identify the Cartesian plane with the complex plane, and then the upper half-plane corresponds to the set of complex numbers with positive imaginary part:

:formula_15

The term arises from a common visualization of the complex number formula_16 as the point formula_17 in the plane endowed with Cartesian coordinates. When the formula_18 axis is oriented vertically, the &quot;upper half-plane&quot; corresponds to the region above the formula_19 axis and thus complex numbers for which formula_20.

It is the domain of many functions of interest in complex analysis, especially modular forms. The lower half-plane, defined by is equally good, but less used by convention. The open unit disk (the set of all complex numbers of absolute value less than one) is equivalent by a conformal mapping to (see &quot;Poincaré metric&quot;), meaning that it is usually possible to pass between 
 and 

It also plays an important role in hyperbolic geometry, where the Poincaré half-plane model provides a way of examining hyperbolic motions. The Poincaré metric provides a hyperbolic metric on the space.

The uniformization theorem for surfaces states that the upper half-plane is the universal covering space of surfaces with constant negative Gaussian curvature.

The closed upper half-plane is the union of the upper half-plane and the real axis. It is the closure of the upper half-plane.

==Generalizations==
One natural generalization in differential geometry is hyperbolic formula_21-space the maximally symmetric, simply connected, -dimensional Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature formula_22. In this terminology, the upper half-plane is 
 since it has real dimension 

In number theory, the theory of Hilbert modular forms is concerned with the study of certain functions on the direct product of copies of the upper half-plane. Yet another space interesting to number theorists is the Siegel upper half-space which is the domain of Siegel modular forms.

<doc id="287831" wikidata="Q1060363" url="?curid=287831" title="TETRA">
<text>Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA; formerly known as Trans-European Trunked Radio), a European standard for a trunked radio system, is a professional mobile radio and two-way transceiver specification. TETRA was specifically designed for use by government agencies, emergency services, (police forces, fire departments, ambulance) for public safety networks, rail transport staff for train radios, transport services and the military. TETRA is the European version of trunked radio, similar to Project 25.

TETRA is a European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) standard, first version published 1995; it is mentioned by the European Radiocommunications Committee (ERC).

== Description ==
TETRA uses time-division multiple access (TDMA) with four user channels on one radio carrier and 25 kHz spacing between carriers. Both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint transfer can be used. Digital data transmission is also included in the standard though at a low data rate.

TETRA Mobile Stations (MS) can communicate direct-mode operation (DMO) or using trunked-mode operation (TMO) using switching and management infrastructure (SwMI) made of TETRA base stations (TBS). As well as allowing direct communications in situations where network coverage is not available, DMO also includes the possibility of using a sequence of one or more TETRA terminals as relays. This functionality is called DMO gateway (from DMO to TMO) or DMO repeater (from DMO to DMO). In emergency situations this feature allows direct communications underground or in areas of bad coverage.

In addition to voice and dispatch services, the TETRA system supports several types of data communication. Status messages and &quot;short data services&quot; (SDS) are provided over the system&#x27;s main control channel, while packet-switched data or circuit-switched data communication uses specifically assigned channels.

TETRA provides for authentication of terminals towards infrastructure and vice versa. For protection against eavesdropping, air interface encryption and end-to-end encryption is available.

The common mode of operation is in a group calling mode in which a single button push will connect the user to the users in a selected call group and/or a dispatcher. It is also possible for the terminal to act as a one-to-one walkie talkie but without the normal range limitation since the call still uses the network. TETRA terminals can act as mobile phones (cell phones), with a full-duplex direct connection to other TETRA Users or the PSTN. Emergency buttons, provided on the terminals, enable the users to transmit emergency signals, to the dispatcher, overriding any other activity taking place at the same time.

== Advantages ==
The main advantages of TETRA over other technologies (such as GSM) are:

* The much lower frequency used gives longer range, which in turn permits very high levels of &quot;geographic&quot; coverage with a smaller number of transmitters, thus cutting infrastructure costs.
* During a voice call, the communications are not interrupted when moving to another network site. This is a unique feature, which dPMR networks typically provide, that allows a number of fall-back modes such as the ability for a base station to process local calls. So called &#x27;mission critical&#x27; networks can be built with TETRA where all aspects are fail-safe/multiple-redundant.
* In the absence of a network, mobiles/portables can use &#x27;direct mode&#x27; whereby they share channels directly (walkie-talkie mode).
* Gateway mode - where a single mobile with connection to the network can act as a relay for other nearby mobiles that are out of range of the infrastructure. A dedicated transponder system isn&#x27;t required in order to achieve this functionality, unlike with analogue radio systems.
* TETRA also provides a point-to-point function that traditional analogue emergency services radio systems did not provide. This enables users to have a one-to-one trunked &#x27;radio&#x27; link between sets without the need for the direct involvement of a control room operator/dispatcher.
* Unlike cellular technologies, which connect one subscriber to one other subscriber (one-to-one), TETRA is built to do one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many. These operational modes are directly relevant to the public safety and professional users.
* Security TETRA supports terminal registration, authentication, air-interface encryption and end-to-end encryption.
* Rapid deployment (transportable) network solutions are available for disaster relief and temporary capacity provision.
* Network solutions are available in both reliable circuit-switched (telephone like) architectures and flat, IP architectures with soft (software) switches.

Further information is available from the TETRA Association (formerly TETRA MoU) and the standards can be downloaded for free from ETSI.

== Disadvantages ==
Its main disadvantages are:

* Serious security issues have been identified, including an intentional weakening of the TEA1 cipher, constituting a full break within a minute on consumer hardware. (See Description)
* Requires a linear amplifier to meet the stringent RF specifications that allow it to exist alongside other radio services.
* Data transfer is slow by modern standards.
Up to 7.2 kbit/s per timeslot, in the case of point-to-point connections, and 3.5 kbit/s per timeslot in case of IP encapsulation.
Both options permit the use of between one and four timeslots.
Different implementations include one of the previous connectivity capabilities, both, or none, and one timeslot or more.
These rates are ostensibly faster than the competing technologies DMR, dPMR, and P25 are capable of. 
Latest version of standard supports 115.2 kbit/s in 25 kHz or up to 691.2 kbit/s in an expanded 150 kHz channel. To overcome the limitations many software vendors have begun to consider hybrid solutions where TETRA is used for critical signalling while large data synchronization and transfer of images and video is done over 3G / LTE.
== Technical details ==

=== Radio aspects ===
For its modulation TETRA, uses differential quadrature phase-shift keying. The symbol (baud) rate is 18,000 symbols per second, and each symbol maps to 2 bits, thus resulting in 36,000 bit/s gross.

As a form of phase shift keying is used to transmit data during each burst, it would seem reasonable to expect the transmit power to be constant. However it is not. This is because the sidebands, which are essentially a repetition of the data in the main carrier&#x27;s modulation, are filtered off with a sharp filter so that unnecessary spectrum is not used up. This results in an amplitude modulation and is why TETRA requires linear amplifiers. The resulting ratio of peak to mean (RMS) power is 3.65 dB. If non-linear (or not-linear enough) amplifiers are used, the sidebands re-appear and cause interference on adjacent channels. Commonly used techniques for achieving the necessary linearity include Cartesian loops, and adaptive predistortion.

The base stations normally transmit continuously and (simultaneously) receive continuously from various mobiles on different carrier frequencies; hence the TETRA system is a frequency-division duplex (FDD) system. TETRA also uses FDMA/TDMA (see above) like GSM. The mobiles normally only transmit on 1 slot/4 and receive on 1 slot/4 (instead of 1 slot/8 for GSM).

Speech signals in TETRA are sampled at 8 kHz and then compressed with a vocoder using &quot;algebraic code-excited linear prediction&quot; (ACELP). This creates a data stream of 4.567 kbit/s. This data stream is error-protection encoded before transmission to allow correct decoding even in noisy (erroneous) channels. The data rate after coding is 7.2 kbit/s. The capacity of a single traffic slot when used 17/18 frames.

A single slot consists of 255 usable symbols, the remaining time is used up with synchronisation sequences and turning on/off, etc. A single &quot;frame&quot; consists of 4 slots, and a &quot;multiframe&quot; (whose duration is 1.02 seconds) consists of 18 frames. Hyperframes also exist, but are mostly used for providing synchronisation to encryption algorithms.

The downlink (i.e., the output of the base station) is normally a continuous transmission consisting of either specific communications with mobile(s), synchronisation or other general broadcasts. All slots are usually filled with a burst even if &quot;idle&quot; (continuous mode). Although the system uses 18 frames per second only 17 of these are used for traffic channels, with the 18th frame reserved for signalling, Short Data Service messages (like SMS in GSM) or synchronisation. The frame structure in TETRA (17.65 frames per second), consists of 18,000 symbols/s; 255 symbols/slot; 4 slots/frame, and is the cause of the &quot;perceived&quot; &quot;amplitude modulation&quot; at 17 Hz and is especially apparent in mobiles/portables which only transmit on one slot/4. They use the remaining three slots to switch frequency to receive a burst from the base station two slots later and then return to their transmit frequency (TDMA).

=== Radio frequencies ===


=== Air interface encryption ===
To provide confidentiality the TETRA air interface is encrypted using one of the &quot;TETRA Encryption Algorithm (TEA)&quot; ciphers. The encryption provides confidentiality (protect against eavesdropping) as well as protection of signalling.

Currently 7 different ciphers are standardized: TEA1 to TEA4 in TEA Set A and TEA5 to TEA7 in TEA Set B. These TEA ciphers should not be confused with the block cipher Tiny Encryption Algorithm. The TEA ciphers have different availability due to export control and use restrictions. In the past few details were published concerning these proprietary ciphers. Riess mentions in early TETRA design documents that encryption should be done with a stream cipher, due to the property of not propagating transmission errors. Parkinson later confirms this and explains that TEA is a stream cipher with 80-bit keys. The algorithms were later reversed and it appeared that TEA1 reduces its key strength to 32 bits. TEA1 and TEA4 provide &quot;basic level&quot; security, and are meant for commercial use. The TEA2 cipher is restricted to European public safety organisations. The TEA3 cipher is for situations where TEA2 is suitable but not available.

==== Security vulnerabilities of the air interface encryption ====
 An in-depth review published in July 2023 by the company Midnight Blue of the TETRA standard and encryption algorithms, the first made public in the last 20 years, has found multiple security flaws, referred by the company as &quot;TETRA:BURST&quot;. A total of 5 flaws were filed to the CVE database:

* The Air Interface Encryption (AIE) keystream generator is vulnerable to decryption oracle attacks due to the use of publicly-broadcast network time—keystream reuse can be triggered for acknowledged unicast communication when using static keys (security class 2). This is not applicable for group communication. 
* TEA1 contains a secret reduction step that effectively downgrades the cryptographic strength from 80 to 32 bits, allowing anyone to break the cipher and subsequently decrypt the signal in as little as one minute using a consumer laptop. &quot;There&#x27;s no other way in which this can function than that this is an intentional backdoor,&quot; &quot;This constitutes a full break of the cipher, allowing for interception or manipulation of radio traffic&quot;, according to the news report posted on &quot;ComputerWeekly&quot;. The deliberately weakened TEA1 flaw seems to be known in intelligence circles and is referred to in the famous 2006 Wikileaks dump of US diplomatic communications .
* AIE contains no authentication for the ciphertext, making malleability attacks possible.
* The cryptographic anonymization scheme is weak and can be partially reversed to track users.
* The authentication algorithm theoretically allowed attackers to set the Derived Cipher Key (DCK) to 0 but not to decrypt traffic.

In addition, the Midnight Blue team spots a &quot;peculiarity regarding the TEA3 S-box&quot;, but has yet to determine whether it constitutes a weakness.

These vulnerabilities remained publicly unknown for 28 years after TETRA&#x27;s publication because TETRA does not make definitions of its cryptographic algorithms public, an example of security through obscurity. The Midnight Blue team gained access to TETRA&#x27;s cryptographic code by attacking the trusted execution environment on a TETRA-enabled radio. The team points to a list of previously broken cryptographic systems relying on obscurity and argues that the Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle should have been followed: the system would have been safer when its structure is publicly known.

=== Cell selection ===

==== Cell re-selection (or hand-over) in images ====
This first representation demonstrates where the slow reselect threshold (SRT), the fast reselect threshold (FRT), and propagation delay exceed parameters are most likely to be. These are represented in association with the decaying radio carrier as the distance increases from the TETRA base station.

From this illustration, these SRT and FRT triggering points are associated to the decaying radio signal strength of the respective cell carriers. The thresholds are situated so that the cell reselection procedures occur on time and assure communication continuity for on-going communication calls.
==== Initial cell selection ====
The next diagram illustrates where a given TETRA radio cell initial selection. The initial cell selection is performed by procedures located in the MLE and in the MAC. When the cell selection is made, and possible registration is performed, the &quot;mobile station&quot; (MS) is said to be attached to the cell. The mobile is allowed to initially select any suitable cell that has a positive C1 value; i.e., the received signal level is greater than the &quot;minimum receive level for access&quot; parameter.

The initial cell selection procedure shall ensure that the MS selects a cell in which it can reliably decode downlink data (i.e., on a main control channel/MCCH), and which has a high probability of uplink communication. The minimum conditions that shall have to be met are that C1 &gt; 0. Access to the network shall be conditional on the successful selection of a cell.

At mobile switch on, the mobile makes its initial cell selection of one of the base stations, which indicates the initial exchanges at activation.

* Refer to EN 300 392 2 16.3.1 Activation and control of underlying MLE service
* Note 18.5.12 Minimum RX access level

The minimum receive access level information element shall indicate the minimum received signal level required at the SwMI in a cell, either the serving cell or a neighbour cell as defined in table 18.24.
==== Cell improvable ====
The next diagram illustrates where a given TETRA radio cell becomes &quot;improvable&quot;. The serving cell becomes improvable when the following occurs: the C1 of the serving cell is below the value defined in the radio network parameter cell reselection parameters, slow reselect threshold for a period of 5 seconds, and the C1 or C2 of a neighbour cell exceeds the C1 of the serving cell by the value defined in the radio network parameter cell reselection parameters, slow reselect hysteresis for a period of 5 seconds.
==== Cell usable ====
The next diagram illustrates where a given TETRA radio cell becomes &quot;usable&quot;. A neighbour cell becomes radio usable when the cell has a downlink radio connection of sufficient quality.

The following conditions must be met in order to declare a neighbour cell radio usable: The neighbour cell has a path loss parameter C1 or C2 that is, for a period of 5 seconds, greater than the fast reselect threshold plus the fast reselect threshold, and the service level provided by the neighbour cell is higher than that of the serving cell. No successful cell reselection shall have taken place within the previous 15 seconds unless MM requests a cell reselection. The MS-MLE shall check the criterion for serving cell relinquishment as often as one neighbour cell is scanned or monitored.

The following conditions will cause the MS to rate the neighbour cell to have higher service level than the current serving cell:
* The MS subscriber class is supported on the neighbour cell but not on the serving cell.
* The neighbour cell is a priority cell and the serving cell is not.
* The neighbour cell supports a service (that is, TETRA standard speech, packet data, or encryption) that is not supported by the serving cell and the MS requires that service to be available.
* The cell service level indicates that the neighbour cell is less loaded than the serving cell.
==== Cell relinquishable (abandonable) ====
The next diagram illustrates where a given TETRA radio cell becomes &quot;relinquishable&quot; (&quot;abandonable&quot;). The serving cell becomes relinquishable when the following occurs: the C1 of the serving cell is below the value defined in the radio network parameter cell reselection parameters, fast reselect threshold, for a period of 5 seconds, and the C1 or C2 of a neighbour cell exceeds the C1 of the serving cell by the value defined in the radio network parameter cell reselection parameters, fast reselect hysteresis, for a period of 5 seconds.

No successful cell reselection shall have taken place within the previous 15 seconds unless Mobility Management (MM) requests a cell reselection. The MS-MLE shall check the criterion for serving cell relinquishment as often as one neighbour cell is scanned or monitored.

==== Radio down-link failure ====
When the FRT threshold is breached, the MS is in a situation where it is essential to relinquish (or abandon) the serving cell and obtain another of at least &quot;usable&quot; quality. That is to say, the mobile station is aware that the radio signal is decaying rapidly, and must cell reselect rapidly, before communications are terminated because of radio link failure. When the mobile station radio-signal breaches the minimum receive level, the radio is no longer in a position to maintain acceptable communications for the user, and the radio link is broken.

Radio link failure: (C1 &lt; 0). Using the suggested values, this would be satisfied with the &quot;serving cell level&quot; below −105 dBm. Cell reselection procedures are then activated in order to find a suitable radio base station.


== Man-machine interface (MMI) ==

=== Virtual MMI for terminals ===
Any given TETRA radio terminal using Java (Java ME/CLDC) based technology, provides the end user with the communication rights necessary to fulfil his or her work role on any short duration assignment.

For dexterity, flexibility, and evolution ability, the public transportation radio engineering department, have chosen to use the open sources, Java language specification administered by Sun and the associated work groups in order to produce a &quot;transport application tool kit&quot;.

Service acquisition admits different authorised agents to establish communication channels between different services by calling the service identity, and without possessing the complete knowledge of the ISSI, GSSI, or any other TETRA related communication establishment numbering plan. Service acquisition is administered through a &quot;communication rights centralised service&quot; or &quot;roll allocation server&quot;, interfaced into the TETRA core network.

In summary, the TETRA MMI aims are to: 
* Allow any given agent while in exercise, to exploit any given radio terminal without materiel constraint.
* Provide specific transportation application software to the end-user agents (service acquisition, fraud, and aggression control).

This &quot;transport application tool-kit&quot; has been produced successfully and with TETRA communication technology and assures for the public transport application requirements for the future mentioned hereafter.

The &quot;home&quot; (&quot;main&quot;) menu presents the end user with three possibilities: 
# Service acquisition,
# Status SDS,
# End-user parameters.

&quot;Service acquisition&quot; provides a means of virtually personalising the end user to any given radio terminal and onto TETRA network for the duration the end user conserves the terminal under his possession.

Status SDS provides the end user with a mechanism for generating a 440 Hz repeating tone that signals a fraud occurrence to members within the same (dynamic or static) Group Short Subscriber Identity (GSSI) or to a specific Individual Short Subscriber Identity (ISSI) for the duration of the assignment (an hour, a morning patrol or a given short period allocated to the assignment). The advantage being that each of the end users may attach themselves to any given terminal, and group for short durations without requiring any major reconfiguration by means of radio software programming tools. Similarly, the aggression feature functions, but with a higher tone frequency (880 Hz), and with a quicker repetitious nature, so to highlight the urgency of the alert.

The &quot;parameters&quot; tab provides an essential means to the terminal end-user allowing them to pre-configure the target (preprogrammed ISSI or GSSI ) destination communication number. With this pre-programmed destination number, the end-user shall liaise with the destination radio terminal or &quot;roll allocation server&quot;, and may communicate, in the group, or into a dedicated server to which the service acquisition requests are received, preprocessed, and ultimately dispatched though the TETRA core network. This simplifies the reconfiguration or recycling configuration process allowing flexibility on short assignments.

The parameters tab also provides a means of choosing between preselected tones to match the work group requirements for the purposes of fraud and aggression alerts. A possibility of selecting any given key available from the keypad to serve as an aggression or fraud quick key is also made possible though the transport application software tool kit. It is recommend to use the asterisk and the hash keys for the fraud and aggression quick keys respectively. For the fraud and aggression tones, it is also recommend to use 440 Hz slow repeating tone (blank space 500 milli-seconds) and 880 Hz fast repeating tone (blank space 250 milliseconds) respectively. The tone options are as follows: 440 Hz, 620 Hz, 880 Hz, and 1060 Hz.

The &quot;parameters&quot; page provides an &quot;aid&quot; or &quot;help&quot; menu and the last tab within parameters describes briefly the tool kit the version and the history of the transport application tool kit to date.

=== TETRA Enhanced Data Service (TEDS) ===
The TETRA Association, working with ETSI, developed the TEDS standard, a wideband data solution, which enhances TETRA with a much higher capacity and throughput for data. In addition to those provided by TETRA, TEDS uses a range of adaptive modulation schemes and a number of different carrier sizes from 25 kHz to 150 kHz. Initial implementations of TEDS will be in the existing TETRA radio spectrum, and will likely employ 50 kHz channel bandwidths as this enables an equivalent coverage footprint for voice and TEDS services. TEDS performance is optimised for wideband data rates, wide area coverage and spectrum efficiency.

Advances in DSP technology have led to the introduction of multi-carrier transmission standards employing QAM modulation. WiMAX, Wi-Fi and TEDS standards are part of this family.

* Mobile Information Device Profile, JSR-37;
* Wireless Messaging API, JSR120;
* Connected Limited Device Configuration, JSR-139; and
* Technology for the Wireless Industry, JTWI-185.

== Comparison to Project 25 ==
Project 25 and TETRA are utilised for the public safety Radio network and Private Sector Radio network worldwide however, it has some differences in technical features and capacities.
* TETRA: It is optimized for high population density areas, with spectral efficiency (4 time slots in 25 kHz: four communications channels per 25 kHz channel, an efficient use of spectrum). It is suitable for high population density areas and supports full duplex voice, data and messaging. but, it is generally unavailable for simulcast, VHF band - however particular vendors have introduced Simulcast and VHF into their TETRA platform..
* P25: it is optimized for wider area coverage with low population density, and support for simulcast. however, it is limited to data support. (Phase 1 P25 radio systems operate in a 12.5 kHz analogue, digital or mixed mode, and P25 Phase II will use a 2-timeslot TDMA structure in 12.5 kHz channels. 
Currently, P25 deployed to more than 53 countries and TETRA deployed to more than 114 countries.

== Professional usage ==
 there were 114 countries using TETRA systems in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, Caribbean and Latin America.

The TETRA-system is in use by the public sector in the following countries. Only TETRA network infrastructure installations are listed. TETRA being an open standard, each of these networks can use any mix of TETRA mobile terminals from a wide range of suppliers.

== Amateur Radio usage ==
In the past decade, TETRA has seen an uptick in usage in the amateur radio community. The perceived higher audio quality compared to other digital voice modes, capacity for packet data, SDS, single frequency DMO repeaters, close proximity of the UHF (430-440MHz) amateur radio band and full duplex audio in TMO are motivating arguments to experiment contacts with this technology. 

Multiple constraints have to be noted when using TETRA for amateur radio service: 

* In most countries, encryption cannot be used.
* Most older (pre-2010) terminals don&#x27;t cover the Region 1 amateur radio frequency range (430-440) natively, and must be modified via software with a possible impact on RF performance. 

Multiple amateur DMO and TMO networks are established throughout Europe. 

Additionally, an open-source project aims to create a complete SDR-based TETRA stack, with a working DMO repeater proof of concept.

<text>Neil Maclean (1875 – 12 September 1953) was a Scottish socialist and an Independent Labour Party and later Labour Party Member of Parliament for Govan.

Maclean was the first Secretary of the Socialist Labour Party, but was expelled in 1908. Then a member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), Maclean worked closely with other socialists in the Glasgow area, as part of the Red Clydeside movement. Like many other Red Clydesiders, he was a conscientious objector during the First World War. He greatly influenced Manny Shinwell. An organiser for the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society, at the 1918 general election, Maclean was elected to the House of Commons to represent Govan in Glasgow. When many of his fellow ILP Clydesiders left the Labour Party, Maclean remained a Labour MP, associating for a time with the Scottish Socialist Party.

Maclean retired from Parliament in 1950, not having secured renomination. He was offered a seat in the House of Lords, but declined due to his socialist principles. He was appointed a CBE.

<doc id="287841" wikidata="Q766908" url="?curid=287841" title="John Wheatley">
<text>John Wheatley (19 May 1869 – 12 May 1930) was a Scottish socialist politician. He was a prominent figure of the Red Clydeside era.

==Early life and career==
Wheatley was born to Thomas and Johanna Wheatley in Bonmahon, County Waterford, Ireland. In 1876 the family moved to Braehead, Lanarkshire in Scotland. Initially—as his father had done in Ireland—he worked as a miner in the Baillieston district. After that he worked briefly as a publican.

Wheatley then started a successful printing business, which published leftist political works. He wrote many of them, including &quot;How the Miners Were Robbed&quot; (1907),
&quot;The Catholic Workingman&quot; (1909), &quot;Miners, Mines and Misery&quot; (1909), &quot;Eight Pound Cottages for Glasgow Citizens&quot; (1913), &quot;Municipal Banking&quot; (1920) and &quot;The New Rent Act&quot; (1920).

He was a deeply religious man and a practising Roman Catholic. Influenced by early Christian-socialist thinkers, in 1907 he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He founded and was the first chairman of the Catholic Socialist Society.

Against the UK&#x27;s involvement in World War I, he campaigned against conscription and assisted in organising rent strikes in Glasgow.

As a councillor on Glasgow&#x27;s city council, he became one of the best known in the city, and was elected to the House of Commons in the 1922 General Election for Glasgow Shettleston. He was a great supporter of Celtic Football Club.

Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald sometimes disapproved of Wheatley&#x27;s debating methods, as well as his friendship with James Maxton. ( Maxton was suspended from the Commons on one occasion when he called Conservative MP Sir Frederick Banbury &quot;a murderer&quot; for a proposed cut in child welfare.) But Wheatley continued to work closely with his ILP colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party, especially Maxton.

Wheatley was known as the intellectual behind the ILP activities. Along with many ILP MPs, especially those from Clydeside, he found himself drifting from MacDonald&#x27;s Labour leadership. Wheatley remained a widely respected political figure and when MacDonald became Prime Minister in January 1924, he appointed Wheatley as his Minister of Health. Wheatley is best remembered for his Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1924, which saw a massive expansion in affordable municipal housing for the working class.

On 9 May 1924, H. G. Wells led a delegation to ask for birth control reforms. The delegation asked for two things: that institutions under Ministry of Health control should give contraceptive advice to those who asked for it; and that doctors at welfare centres should be allowed to offer advice in certain medical cases. Wheatley held strong views against birth control and refused to support the campaign. 

Wheatley criticised MacDonald for moving Labour to the right. Consequently he did not hold a post in the Labour Government which formed after the 1929 United Kingdom general election. He refused to support many of the measures proposed by MacDonald&#x27;s government. Along with Maxton (now Wheatley&#x27;s leader in the ILP) he became one of the Labour-left&#x27;s leading critics.

==Death and legacy==
John Wheatley died on 12 May 1930, at age 60.

Wheatley Housing Group (Scotland&#x27;s largest registered social landlord) and John Wheatley College (now Glasgow Kelvin College) in Glasgow are named after him. His nephew, John Thomas Wheatley, became a Labour MP for Edinburgh East in 1947 and Lord Advocate.

<text>Sprouting is the natural process by which seeds or spores germinate and put out shoots, and already established plants produce new leaves or buds, or other structures experience further growth.

In the field of nutrition, the term signifies the practice of germinating seeds (for example, mung beans or sunflower seeds) to be eaten raw or cooked, which is considered more nutritious.

==Suitable seeds==


All viable seeds can be sprouted, but some sprouts, such as kidney beans, should not be eaten raw.

Bean sprouts are a common ingredient across the world. They are particularly common in Eastern Asian cuisine. It typically takes one week for them to become fully grown. The sprouted beans are more nutritious than the original beans, and they require much less cooking time. There are two common types of bean sprouts:

* Mung bean sprouts, made from greenish-capped mung beans
* Soybean sprouts, made from yellow, large-grained soybeans

Common sprouts used as food include:
* Pulses/legumes (pea family) - bean sprouts:
*:alfalfa, clover, fenugreek, lentil, pea, chickpea (garbanzo), mung bean, and soy bean
* Cereals (grasses):
*:oat, wheat, maize (corn), rice, barley, and rye
* Pseudocereals:
*:quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat
* Oilseeds:
*:sesame, sunflower, almond, hazelnut, hemp, linseed, and peanut
* Brassica (cabbage family):
*:broccoli, cabbage, watercress, mustard, mizuna, radish, and daikon (&quot;kaiware-daikon&quot; in Japanese cuisine), arugula, tatsoi, and turnip
* Umbelliferous vegetables (parsley family) - these may be used more as microgreens than sprouts:
*:carrot, celery, fennel, and parsley.
* Allium (onion family) - cannot distinguish sprouts from microgreens:
*:onion, leek, and green onion (&quot;me-negi&quot; in Japanese cuisine)
* Other vegetables and herbs:
*:spinach, lettuce, milk thistle, and lemon grass

Although whole oats can be sprouted, oat &quot;groats&quot; sold in food stores, which are dehulled and have been steamed or roasted to prevent rancidity, will not sprout. Whole oats may have an indigestible hull which makes them difficult or even unfit for human consumption. In the case of rice, the husk of the paddy is removed before sprouting. Brown rice is widely used for germination in Japan and other countries, becoming germinated brown rice. Quinoa in its natural state is very easy to sprout, but when polished, or pre-cleaned of its saponin coating (becoming whiter), it loses its power to germinate.

Sprouts of the family Solanaceae (tomato, potato, paprika, and aubergine/eggplant) and the family Polygonaceae (rhubarb) cannot be eaten raw, as they can be poisonous. Some sprouts can be cooked to remove the relevant toxin, while others cannot.

With all seeds, care should be taken that they are intended for sprouting or human consumption, rather than sowing. Seeds intended for sowing may be treated with toxic chemical dressings. Several countries, such as New Zealand, require that some varieties of imported edible seed be heat-treated, thus making it impossible for them to sprout.

===The germination process===
The germination process takes a few days and can be done at home manually, as a semi-automated process, or industrially on a large scale for commercial use. The time it takes for germination depends on the type of seed and their environment.

Typically the seeds are first rinsed to remove soil, dirt and the mucilaginous substances produced by some seeds when they come in contact with water. Then they are soaked for from 20 minutes to 12 hours, depending on the type and size of the seed. The soaking increases the water content in the seeds and brings them out of quiescence. After draining and then rinsing seeds at regular intervals, the seeds then germinate, or sprout.

For home sprouting, the seeds are soaked (big seeds) or moistened (small), then left at room temperature () in a sprouting vessel. Many different types of vessels can be used as a sprouting vessel. One type is a simple glass jar with a piece of cloth or nylon window screen secured over its rim. Tiered clear-plastic sprouters are commercially available, allowing a number of crops to be grown simultaneously. By staggering sowings, a constant supply of young sprouts can be ensured. Any vessel used for sprouting must allow water to drain from it, because sprouts that sit in water will rot quickly. The seeds swell, may stick to the sides of the jar, and begin germinating within a day or two.

Another sprouting technique is to use a pulse drip method. The photo below on the right shows crimson clover sprouts grown on urethane foam mats. It is a one-way watering system with micro-sprinklers providing intermittent pulses of fresh water to reduce the risk of bacterial cross-contamination with Salmonella and E. coli during the sprouting process.

Sprouts are rinsed two to four times a day, depending on the climate and the type of seed, to provide them with moisture and prevent them from souring. Each seed has its own ideal sprouting time. After three to five days the sprouts will have grown in length and will be suitable for consumption. If left longer they will begin to develop leaves, and are then known as baby greens. A popular baby green is a sunflower after 7–10 days. Refrigeration can be used as needed to slow or halt the growth process of any sprout.

Common causes for sprouts becoming inedible:
* Seeds are not rinsed well enough before soaking
* Seeds are left in standing water after the initial soaking
* Seeds are allowed to dry out
* Temperature is too high or too low
* Dirty equipment
* Insufficient air flow
* Contaminated water source
* Poor germination rate

Mung beans can be sprouted either in light or dark conditions. Those sprouted in the dark will be crisper in texture and whiter, as in the case of commercially available Chinese Bean Sprouts, but these have less nutritional content than those grown in partial sunlight. Growing in full sunlight is not recommended, because it can cause the beans to overheat or dry out. Subjecting the sprouts to pressure, for example, by placing a weight on top of them in their sprouting container, will result in larger, crunchier sprouts similar to those sold in grocery stores.

A very effective way to sprout beans like lentils or azuki is in colanders. Soak the beans in water for about 8 hours then place in the colander. Wash twice a day. The sprouted beans can be eaten raw or cooked.

Sprouting is also applied on a large scale to barley as a part of the malting process. Malted barley is an important ingredient in beer and is used in large quantities. Most malted barley is widely distributed among retail sellers in North America.

Many varieties of nuts, such as almonds and peanuts, can also be started in their growth cycle by soaking and sprouting, although because the sprouts are generally still very small when eaten, they are usually called &quot;soaks&quot;.

==Nutrition==


Sprouts can be germinated at home or produced industrially. They are a prominent ingredient of a raw food diet and are common in Eastern Asian cuisine.

Raw lentils contain lectins which can be reduced by sprouting or cooking. A downside to consuming raw sprouts is that the process of germinating seeds can also be conducive to harmful bacterial growth.

Sprouts are rich in digestible energy, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, proteins, and phytochemicals, as these are necessary for a germinating plant to grow.

* &quot;The metabolic activity of resting seeds increases as soon as they are hydrated during soaking. Complex biochemical changes occur during hydration and subsequent sprouting. The reserve chemical constituents, such as protein, starch and lipids, are broken down by enzymes into simple compounds that are used to make new compounds.&quot;
* &quot;Sprouting grains causes increased activities of hydrolytic enzymes, improvements in the contents of total proteins, fat, certain essential amino acids, total sugars, B-group vitamins, and a decrease in dry matter, starch and anti-nutrients. The increased contents of protein, fat, fibre and total ash are only apparent and attributable to the disappearance of starch. However, improvements in amino acid composition, B-group vitamins, sugars, protein and starch digestibilities, and decrease in phytates and protease inhibitors are the metabolic effects of the sprouting process.&quot;

===Protein===
&quot;Very complex qualitative changes are reported to occur during soaking and sprouting of seeds. The conversion of storage proteins of cereal grains into albumins and globulins during sprouting may improve the quality of cereal proteins. Many studies have shown an increase in the content of the amino acid lysine with sprouting.&quot;

&quot;An increase in proteolytic activity during sprouting is desirable for nutritional improvement of cereals because it leads to hydrolysis of prolamins and the liberated amino acids such as glutamic and proline are converted to limiting amino acids such as lysine.&quot;

===Fiber===
&quot;In sprouted barley, crude fiber, a major constituent of cell walls, increases both in percentage and real terms, with the synthesis of structural carbohydrates, such as cellulose and hemicellulose.&quot;

===Vitamins===
Sprouting treatment of cereal grains may improve vitamin value, especially the B-group vitamins. Certain vitamins such as α-tocopherol (vitamin-E) and β-carotene (vitamin-A precursor) are produced during the growth process.

==Health concerns==

===Bacterial infection===
Commercially grown sprouts have been associated with multiple outbreaks of harmful bacteria, including salmonella and toxic forms of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. Such infections, which are so frequent in the United States that investigators call them &quot;sproutbreaks&quot;, may be a result of contaminated seeds or of unhygienic production with high microbial counts. Sprout seeds can become contaminated in the fields where they are grown, and sanitizing steps may be unable to kill bacteria hidden in damaged seeds. A single surviving bacterium in a kilogram of seed can be enough to contaminate a whole batch of sprouts, according to the FDA.

To minimize the impact of the incidents and maintain public health, both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Canada issued industry guidance on the safe manufacturing of edible sprouts and public education on their safe consumption. There are also publications for hobby farmers on safely growing and consuming sprouts at home. The recommendations include development and implementation of good agricultural practices and good manufacturing practices in the production and handling of seeds and sprouts, seed disinfection treatments, and microbial testing before the product enters the food supply.

In June 2011, contaminated fenugreek sprouts (grown from seed from Egypt) in Germany was identified as the source of the 2011 E. coli O104:H4 outbreak which German officials had at first wrongly blamed on cucumbers from Spain and then on mung bean sprouts. In addition to Germany, where 3,785 cases and 45 deaths had been reported by the end of the outbreak, a handful of cases were reported in several countries including Switzerland, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, the UK, Canada, and the USA. Virtually all affected people had been in Germany shortly before becoming ill.

===Anti-nutritional factors===
Some legumes, including sprouts, can contain toxins or anti-nutritional factors, which can be reduced by soaking, sprouting and cooking. Joy Larkcom advises that to be on the safe side &quot;one shouldn’t eat large quantities of raw legume sprouts on a regular basis, no more than about 550g (20oz) daily&quot;.

Phytic acid, an anti-nutritional factor, occurs primarily in the seed coats and germ tissue of plant seeds. It forms insoluble or nearly insoluble compounds with many metal ions, including those of calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc, reducing their dietary availability. Diets high in phytic acid and poor in these minerals produce mineral deficiency in experimental animals (Gontzea and Sutzescu, 1968, as cited in Chavan and Kadam, 1989). The latter authors state that the sprouting of cereals has been reported to decrease levels of phytic acid. Similarly, Shipard (2005) states that enzymes of germination and sprouting can help decrease the detrimental substances such as phytic acid. However, the amount of phytic acid reduction from soaking is only marginal, and not enough to fully counteract its anti-nutrient effects.

===Canavanine===
Alfalfa seeds and sprouts contain L-canavanine, which can cause lupus-like disease in primates.

==European Union regulations==
In order to prevent incidents like the 2011 EHEC epidemic, on 11 March 2013, the European Commission issued three new, tighter regulations.
* Regulation (EU) No 208/2013 requires that the origins of seeds must always be traceable at all stages of processing, production, and distribution. Therefore, a full description of the seeds or sprouts needs to be kept on record. (see also Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002)
* Regulation (EU) No 209/2013 amends Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 in respect of microbiological criteria for sprouts and the sampling rules for poultry carcasses and fresh poultry meat.
* Regulation (EU) No 211/2013 requires that imported sprouts and seeds intended for the production of sprouts have a certificate, drawn up in accordance with the model certificate in the Annex of the regulation, that serves as proof that the production process complies with the general hygiene provisions in Part A of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 and the traceability requirements of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 208/2013.

<doc id="287844" wikidata="Q1073789" url="?curid=287844" title="NTLDR">
<text>NTLDR (abbreviation of NTloader) is the boot loader for all releases of Windows NT operating system from 1993 with the release of Windows NT 3.1 up until Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. From Windows Vista onwards it was replaced by the BOOTMGR bootloader. NTLDR is typically run from the primary storage device, but it can also run from portable storage devices such as a CD-ROM, USB flash drive, or floppy disk. NTLDR can also load a non NT-based operating system given the appropriate boot sector in a file.

NTLDR requires, at the minimum, the following two files to be on the system volume:

* , the main boot loader itself
* , required for booting an NT-based OS, detects basic hardware information needed for successful boot

An additional important file is &quot;boot.ini&quot;, which contains boot configuration (if missing, NTLDR will default to &quot;\Windows&quot; on the first partition of the first hard drive).

NTLDR is launched by the volume boot record of system partition, which is typically written to the disk by the Windows or command.

==History==
Windows NT was originally designed for ARC-compatible platforms, relying on its boot manager support and providing only &quot;osloader.exe&quot;, a loading program accepting ordinary command-line arguments specifying Windows directory partition, location or boot parameters, which is launched by ARC-compatible boot manager when a user chooses to start specific Windows NT operating system. However, because IBM PC compatible machines lacked any of the ARC support, as that platform preceded ARC, the additional layer was added specifically for that platform: custom boot manager code presenting text menu allowing the user to choose from one or more operating system and its options configured in &quot;boot.ini&quot; configuration file, prepended by special StartUp module which is responsible for some preparations such as switching the CPU to the protected mode. When a user chooses an operating system from the boot menu, the following command-line arguments are then passed to the part of the &quot;osloader.exe&quot; common to all processor architectures:

In Windows releases starting from Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, NTLDR has been split off back to its boot manager and system loader parts: the Windows Boot Manager and &quot;winload.exe&quot;. The boot manager part has been completely rewritten; it no longer uses &quot;boot.ini&quot; as a configuration file, although the &quot;bootcfg&quot; utility for modifying boot.ini is still present for the case of multi-boot configurations with Windows versions up to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

==Command-line interface==
The bootsect.exe utility program in the Windows PE tools has options /nt52 (NTLDR) and /nt60 (Vista and up) to store a NTLDR or Vista boot record in the first sector of a specified partition. The command can be used for FAT and NTFS based file systems. It replaces the FixFAT and FixNTFS tools.

===Example===
The following example applies the NTLDR compatible master boot code to the D: volume:

C:\&gt;bootsect /nt52 D:
==Startup process==

When a PC is powered on its BIOS follows the configured boot order to find a bootable device. This can be a harddisk, floppy, CD/DVD, network connection, USB-device, etc. depending on the BIOS. In the case of a floppy the BIOS interprets its boot sector (first sector) as code, for NTLDR this could be a NTLDR boot sector looking for the codice_1 file on the floppy. For a harddisk the code in the Master Boot Record (first sector) determines the active partition. The code in the boot sector of the active partition could then be again a NTLDR boot sector looking for codice_1 in the root directory of this active partition. In a more convoluted scenario the active partition can contain a Vista boot sector for the newer Vista boot manager with an {ntldr} entry pointing to another partition with a NTLDR boot sector.

When booting, the loader portion of NTLDR does the following in order:

#Accesses the file system on the boot drive (either FAT or New Technology File System, NTFS).
#If Windows was put in the hibernation state, the contents of &quot;hiberfil.sys&quot; are loaded into memory and the system resumes where it left off.
#Otherwise, reads &quot;boot.ini&quot; and prompts the user with the boot menu accordingly.
#If a non NT-based OS is selected, NTLDR loads the associated file listed in &quot;boot.ini&quot; (&quot;bootsect.dos&quot; if no file is specified or if the user is booting into a DOS based OS) and gives it control.
#If an NT-based OS is selected, NTLDR runs &quot;ntdetect.com&quot;, which gathers information about the computer&#x27;s hardware. (If &quot;ntdetect.com&quot; hangs during hardware detection, there is a debug version called &quot;ntdetect.chk&quot; that can be found on Microsoft support.)
#Starts &quot;ntoskrnl.exe&quot;, passing to it the information returned by &quot;ntdetect.com&quot;.

== boot.ini ==
NTLDR&#x27;s first action is to read the &quot;boot.ini&quot; file. NTLDR allows the user to choose which operating system to boot from at the menu. For NT and NT-based operating systems, it also allows the user to pass preconfigured options to the kernel. The menu options are stored in &quot;boot.ini&quot;, which itself is located in the root of the same disk as NTLDR. Though NTLDR can boot DOS and non-NT versions of Windows, boot.ini cannot configure their boot options.

For NT-based OSs, the location of the operating system is written as an Advanced RISC Computing (ARC) path.

&quot;boot.ini&quot; is protected from user configuration by having the following file attributes: system, hidden, read-only. To manually edit it, the user would first have to remove these attributes.
A more secure fashion to edit the file is to use the &quot;bootcfg&quot; command from a console. &quot;bootcfg&quot; will also relock the file (setting the file back to system, hidden, and read-only). Additionally, the file can be edited within Windows using a text editor if the folder view option &quot;Show hidden files and folders&quot; is selected, the folder view option &quot;Hide protected operating system files&quot; is unchecked, and the &quot;Read-only&quot; option is unchecked under the file&#x27;s properties.

&quot;bootsect.dos&quot; is the boot sector loaded by NTLDR to load DOS, or if there is no file specified when loading a non NT-based OS.

=== Example ===
An example of a &quot;boot.ini&quot; file:

[boot loader]
timeout=40
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS
[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS=&quot;Microsoft Windows XP Professional&quot; /fastdetect
If the boot loader timeout option in &quot;boot.ini&quot; is set to 0, the NTLDR boot menu does not appear.
Extreme caution should be taken when modifying the boot loader, as erroneous information can result in an OS that fails to boot.

=== NT kernel switches ===
* Forces x86-based systems to &quot;increase&quot; the virtual address space allocated for user programs to 3 GB, and to &quot;decrease&quot; to 1 GB allocated to the kernel and to executive components. Used for some programs that require more than the standard 2 GB allocated to user programs and 2 GB allocated to the system. Some configurations of Windows Server 2003 that run virtual memory-intensive applications such as database servers or Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 may require this switch or may benefit from improved performance. Activating this option may break VMR-9 video. Activating this option may also cause audio problems with Creative SB X-Fi series sound cards with (X-Fi Gamer / X-Fi Titanium @ WINXP 32-bit 3/2012). These problems may be connected to the way that Creatives drivers handle memory over 2 GB.
* Forces the system into standard 640 × 480 16-color VGA mode by using a video device driver that is compatible with any video adapter. If the operating system fails to load due to a faulty or incorrectly configured video driver, this switch allows the system to load, so the user may then remove, update, or roll back the video driver causing the problem. Using this switch in conjunction with the switch helps to determine the driver that is triggering a failure.
* Sets the baud rate of the debug port that is used for kernel debugging. Use of this switch automatically enables the switch. Specifies an override for the default baud rate (19200) at which a remote kernel debugger host will connect. Example: .
* Turns on boot logging to a file named .
* Displays an alternate 640 × 480 16-color custom bitmap. The bitmap must be saved in the \Windows directory with the name . Use with the switch.
* Specifies the amount of memory, in megabytes, that Windows cannot use. Use this parameter to confirm a performance problem or other problems that are related to RAM depletion.
* Use with the switch and the switch to selects the IEEE 1394 interface channel (numbered 0 to 62) through which kernel debugging communications will flow.
* Loads the kernel debugger at OS startup, but it remains inactive until a Stop error occurs. With this switch, the COM port can be used for normal operations while Windows is running. If Windows crashes, the switch converts the port to a debug port. (This action turns on remote debugging.)
* Turns on the kernel debugger when Windows starts. Unlike the switch, uses the COM port whether you use debugging or not.
* Specifies the COM port to use for the debug port. By default, uses COM2 if it exists. Otherwise, the default is COM1. Use of this switch automatically enables the switch.
* Turns off serial and bus mouse detection for the specified port(s), or for all ports if none are specified. Use this switch when there is a component other than a mouse attached to a serial port during the startup process. Ports may be separated with commas to turn off more than one port. (Note: In earlier versions of Windows, including Windows NT 4.0, this switch was named .)
* Defines the Hardware Abstraction Layer that is loaded at startup. This switch is useful to try out a different HAL before you rename the file to . This switch is also useful when you want to try to switch between starting in multiprocessor mode and starting in single processor mode. To do this, use this switch with the switch. filename must be in System32 directory. It can be a simple file, hard link, but not a symbolic link or a junction point.
* Defines the kernel that is loaded at startup. With this switch, the user can switch between a debug-enabled kernel that is full of debugging code and a regular kernel. Same limitations for filename location and type as for /HAL switch.
* Specifies the maximum amount of RAM, in megabytes, that Windows can use. However, the switch does not account for memory holes. Therefore, it is recommended to use the switch instead.
* This option is used by Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE) and loads the Registry SYSTEM hive as a volatile hive such that changes made to it in memory are not saved back to the hive image.
* Turns off debugging. This scenario can cause a Stop Error if a program has a debug hardcoded breakpoint in its software.
* } This option is only available on 32-bit versions of Windows when running on processors supporting Data Execution Prevention (DEP). It enables DEP, which results in the memory manager marking pages containing data as no-execute so that they cannot be executed as code. This can be useful for preventing malicious code from exploiting buffer overflow bugs with unexpected program input in order to execute arbitrary code. No-execute protection is always enabled on 64-bit versions of Windows on processors that support no-execute protection. There are several options the user can specify with this switch:
** Enables DEP for core system images and those specified in the DEP configuration dialog.
** Enables DEP for all images except those specified in the DEP configuration dialog.
** Enables DEP on all images.
** Disables DEP.
* Displays the device driver names while they are being loaded. Use with the switch to determine the driver that is triggering a failure.
* Forces Ntldr to load the non-Physical Address Extension (PAE) version of the Windows kernel, even if the system is detected as supporting x86 PAEs and has more than 4 GB of physical memory.
* (Obsolete on all versions post-Windows NT 4.0) Replaced by the absence of the switch. Disables serial mouse detection on the specified COM ports. Using without specifying a COM port disables serial mouse detection on all COM ports.
* Sets the number of processors that Windows will run at startup. With this switch, the user can force a multiprocessor system to use only the quantity of processors (number) that you specify. Useful for troubleshooting performance problems and defective CPUs.
* Equivalent to using . Causes Windows to use only one CPU on a multiprocessor system.
* Enables Physical Address Extension support. In Safe Mode, the computer starts by using normal kernels, even if the switch is specified.
* For x86-based systems, this stops the operating system from dynamically assigning hardware input, hardware output, and interrupt request resources to PCI devices. Instead, the BIOS configures the devices.
* Turns on Emergency Management Services (EMS) on a Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition-based computer. To turn on EMS by editing the Boot.ini on an x86-based computer, edit both the [boot loader] section and the [operating systems] section of the Boot.ini file.
* Starts Windows in Safe Mode. You must include the colon plus one of the three types listed above. An additional option the user can append is , which tells Windows to use the program specified by the value as the graphical shell rather than to use the default, which is Windows Explorer. The user can also combine other parameters with . The following examples illustrate the parameters that are in effect when you select a Safe Mode option from the startup recovery menu. (Note: The , , and switches are not required with any one of these settings, but the switches can help with troubleshooting.)
** Safe Mode () Default: Uses a minimal set of device drivers and services to start Windows.
** Safe Mode with Networking () Default mode together with the drivers necessary to load networking.
** Safe Mode with Command Prompt () Default mode, except that Cmd.exe starts instead of Windows Explorer.
** Windows in Directory Services Restore Mode () (This mode is valid only for Windows-based domain controllers.) Performs a directory service repair.
* Disables the graphical boot screen and uses the NT4 style text-boot, listing the Windows build number, version number, etc. In Windows 2000 and XP, the text is rendered inside the CHKDSK bitmap (and with a progress bar in 2000).
* Specifies that Windows uses the Power Management Timer (PM_TIMER) timer settings instead of the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) timer settings if the processor supports the PM_TIMER settings. By default, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 (SP2) uses the PM timer for all multiprocessor APIC or ACPI HALs. If you are not running Windows Server 2003 SP2, you must force the computer to use the PM timer by using the switch.
* Customizes the amount of memory, in megabytes, that is allocated to processes when using the switch. This switch permits more page table entry kernel memory but still maintains almost 3 GB of process memory space.
* Directs Ntldr to boot the Windows boot sector stored in .
* Directs Ntldr to boot the MS-DOS boot sector stored in .
* Instructs the Windows core time function to ignore the year that the computer&#x27;s real-time clock reports and instead use the one indicated. Example: . (This switch was created to assist in Y2K testing.)

<text>Belfort (; archaic , ) is a city in northeastern France, situated approximately from the Swiss border. It is the prefecture of the Territoire de Belfort.

Belfort is from Paris and from Basel. The residents of the city are called &quot;Belfortains&quot;. The city is located on the river Savoureuse, on a strategically important natural route between the Rhine and the Rhône – the Belfort Gap (&quot;Trouée de Belfort&quot;) or Burgundian Gate (&quot;Porte de Bourgogne&quot;). It is located approximately south from the base of the Ballon d&#x27;Alsace mountain range, source of the Savoureuse. The city of Belfort has 46,443 inhabitants (2019). Belfort is the centre of a larger functional area (metropolitan area) with 133,597 inhabitants (2018), between the larger metropolitan areas of Mulhouse and Montbéliard.

== History ==
===Early history===
Belfort&#x27;s strategic location, in a natural gap between the Vosges and the Jura, on a route linking the Rhine and the Rhône, has attracted human settlement since Roman times, and has also made it a frequent target for invading armies many times in its history.

The site of Belfort was inhabited in Gallo-Roman times. Later, it was heavily settled by Germanic peoples during the Germanic migrations, most notably the Burgundians, who settled in the region after the Gallo-Roman inhabitants had been displaced. It was subsequently recorded in the 13th century as a possession of the counts of Montbéliard, who granted it a charter in 1307.

Previously an Austrian possession, Belfort was transferred to France by the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), which ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The town&#x27;s fortifications were extended and developed by the military architect Vauban for Louis XIV. The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1724.

===Franco-Prussian War===
Until 1871, Belfort was part of the &quot;département&quot; of Haut-Rhin, in Alsace. The Siege of Belfort (between 3 November 1870 and 18 February 1871) during the Franco Prussian war was successfully resisted by the French until the garrison was ordered to surrender 21 days after the armistice between France and Prussia ended the war. The region was not annexed by Prussia like the rest of Alsace was. It was exchanged for territories in the vicinity of Metz. It formed, as it still does, the Territoire de Belfort. The siege is commemorated by a huge statue, the Lion of Belfort, by Frédéric Bartholdi. Alsatians not wanting to live under German rule in annexed Alsace and who wanted a French life and home in Belfort made a significant contribution to Belfort and French industry (see Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques) after 1872.

===1892 Paris-Belfort running race===
On 5 June 1892, &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot; organised a foot-race from Paris to Belfort, a course of over , the first large-scale long-distance running race on record. Over 1,100 competitors registered for the event and over 800 started from the offices of &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot;, at Paris Opera. This had also been the start point for the inaugural Paris–Brest–Paris cycle-race the previous year. The newspaper&#x27;s circulation dramatically increased as the French public followed the progress of race participants, 380 of whom completed the course in under ten days. In &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot; on 18 June 1892, Pierre Giffard praised the event as a model for the physical training of a nation faced by hostile neighbours. The event was won by Constant Ramoge in 100 hours, 5 minutes.

===World War One===
The town was bombarded by the German Army during World War I. Before the war, the September Programme of German Imperial Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, pressed for expansionist aims of French territory, specifically advocated the annexation of the Belfort region along with the western side of the Vosges Mountains.

===World War Two===
After the 1940 Battle of France with the German victory, Belfort fell within the Nazi German occupation zone. In November 1944, the retreating Wehrmacht held off the French First Army outside the town until French Commandos made a successful night attack on the Salbert Fort. Belfort was liberated on 22 November 1944. It is believed that Adolf Hitler intended to annex Belfort into the German Gau Baden–Alsace, but it never took place.

==Geography==

==Population==

== Economy ==
Belfort is a centre for heavy engineering industries, mostly dedicated to railways and turbines. Belfort is the hometown of Alstom where the first TGVs (Trains à Grande Vitesse, High Speed Trains) were produced, as well as hosting the GE Power European headquarters and a centre of excellence for the manufacturing of gas turbines.

== Transport==

===Road===
Belfort is located at a busy hub in the region&#x27;s local and long-distance road network. Its proximity to the commercial port of Mulhouse-Rhin facilitates international trade. The motorway A36 from Beaune to Mulhouse follows a route to the south and east of the city, and forms the main axis linking Belfort to other French and European cities. Passing just south of town, N19 connects Langres (and thereby Paris and Troyes) to the Swiss canton of Jura.

===Air===
EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg is located about east of Belfort (1 hour drive).

=== Rail links ===
Belfort is well connected with the rest of France, with direct connections by train to major destinations such as Paris, Dijon, Besançon, Mulhouse, Strasbourg, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier and Lille, including high-speed trains. Some trains operate into Switzerland, such as Basel and Zürich stations. There is also a train service to Frankfurt am Main in Germany.

Regional services connect Belfort to Montbéliard, Besançon, Mulhouse, Vesoul, Épinal and Nancy.

*Belfort station is the main railway station in the centre of the city.
*Belfort – Montbéliard TGV station is the high speed railway station, located south of the city.

From 2017, regional trains will connect Belfort with Belfort-Montbéliard TGV station using the new Belfort–Delle railway link. This service links Belfort and the surrounding area to Switzerland, and the high-speed train link will connect Swiss towns such as Delémont, Bern, Fribourg and Lausanne to Paris and other cities. Before 2020, the service Épinal-Belfort will be electrified and modernized. This will allow a link between LGV Est and LGV Rhin-Rhône in Belfort-Montbéliard TGV station, opening new destinations like Nancy, Metz and Luxembourg.

<text>Larnaca, also spelled Larnaka, is a city on the southeast coast of Cyprus and the capital of the district of the same name. With a district population of 144,200 in 2015, it is the third largest city in the country after Nicosia and Limassol.

Built on the ruins of Citium, the Ancient Greek city-state best known as the birthplace of Stoic philosopher Zeno of Citium, Larnaca is home to the Church of Saint Lazarus, Hala Sultan Tekke, Kamares Aqueduct, Larnaca Castle, Larnaca District Archaeological Museum, and Pierides Museum. It attracts many visitors to its beaches, as well as Finikoudes (Φοινικούδες; Greek for &quot;palm trees&quot;), its signature seafront promenade lined with palm trees. It gives its name to the country&#x27;s primary airport, Larnaca International Airport, which is situated in the neighbouring village of Dromolaxia rather than Larnaca proper. It also has a seaport and a marina.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Larnaca&quot; originates from the Ancient Greek noun &#x27;coffer, box; chest, e.g. for household stores; cinerary urn, sarcophagus, coffin; drinking trough, chalice&#x27;. An informal etymology attributes the origin of the name to the many &quot;larnakes&quot; (sarcophagi) that have been found in the area. Sophocles Hadjisavvas, a state archeologist, states that &quot;[the city&#x27;s U.S.] consul of the last quarter of the 19th century, claimed to have explored more than 3,000 tombs in the area of Larnaca, so-called after the immense number of sarcophagi found in the modern town&quot;.

The city is also colloquially known as “Skala” from the Greek noun σκάλα, meaning ladder. In Turkish it has been translated to İskele. This name referred to the historic port of the city, though now it is the name of the area which surrounds it, in which the Turkish Cypriot inhabitants of the city lived in prior to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. After which they migrated to Trikomo, which was later renamed to Yeni İskele (meaning “New Skala”), in honour of their origins.

== History ==
The former city-kingdom of Kition was originally established in the 13th century BC. New cultural elements appearing between 1200 BC and 1000 BC, including pottery, new architectural forms. These archaeological findings are interpreted as indications of significant political changes and the arrival of the Achaeans, the first Greek colonists of Kition. Around the same time, Phoenicians settled the area.

At the archaeological sites of Kiteon, remains that date from the 13th century BC have been found. Around 1000 BC, Kition was rebuilt by Phoenicians and it subsequently became a center of Phoenician culture. The remains of the sites include cyclopean walls and a complex of five temples and a naval port.

It was conquered in the first millennium BC by a series of great powers of the region. First by the Assyrian Empire, then by Egypt. Like most Cypriot cities, Kition belonged to the Persian Achaemenid Empire. In 450 BC, the Athenian general Cimon died at sea, while militarily supporting the revolt against Persia&#x27;s rule over Cyprus. On his deathbed, he urged his officers to conceal his death from both their allies and the Persians.

Strong earthquakes hit the city in 76 AD and the year after.

Earthquakes of 322 AD and 342 &quot;caused the destruction not only of Kition but also of Salamis and Pafos&quot;. Kition&#x27;s harbor silted up, and the population moved to the seafront farther south, sometime after this. Contributing factors to the silting are thought to have been earthquakes, deforestation, and overgrazing.

The commercial port was located at Skala, during the Ottoman Period starting in 1571. Skala is the name of the seashore immediately south of the Larnaca Castle and its neighborhood.

==Geography==
The Salt Lake fills with water during the winter season and is visited by flocks of flamingoes who stay there from November until the end of March. It usually dries up in the summer. In the past, it yielded good quality salt scraped from the dried surface. The salt from the lake is now considered unsuitable for consumption.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is described by the Köppen Climate Classification System as a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) due to its low annual rainfall and hot summer temperatures resulting in highly negative water balance. It is sometimes described as a mediterranean climate due to the pronounced rainy season in winter and virtually rainless summers, but the total annual rainfall is below the required amount to avoid the semi-arid classification.

== Promenade ==
Finikoudes is the promenade along Athenon Avenue on the seafront. A row of palm trees (Cypriot Greek: , ) lines either side of it.

Much of the activity is centered on the city promenade during the major festivals. The most important of these is &quot;Kataklysmos&quot; or the &quot;Festival of the Flood&quot;, celebrated in early summer with a series of cultural events. The festival used to last for about a week, but, in recent years, with the increased commercialism of peripheral stalls, rides, and temporary Lokma restaurants, the festival has been extended to about three weeks, during which the seafront is closed to traffic in the evenings.

== Monuments ==

* A bust of Cimon stands on the Foinikoudes Promenade, with this quote referring to him on the pedestal: &quot;Even in death he was victorious&quot; ().
* The marble bust of Zeno of Citium stands at the crossroads near the American Academy. Zeno was born in Kition in 334 BC. After studying philosophy in Athens, he founded the Stoicism school of philosophy.
* The Armenian Genocide Memorial stands on Athenon Avenue.

== Landmarks ==
The city&#x27;s landmarks include the Church of Saint Lazarus, the Catacomb of Phaneromeni Church, Hala Sultan Tekke, the Bekir Pasha Aqueduct, and the Larnaca Castle.

==Economy==

Larnaca&#x27;s economy has been growing since 1975, after the loss of the Port of Famagusta, which handled 80% of general cargo, and the closure of Nicosia International Airport, events which have seen Larnaca&#x27;s airport and seaport play increasingly important roles in the economy of the island. A €650m upgrade of Larnaca Airport has been completed.

The service sector, including tourism, employs three-quarters of Larnaca&#x27;s labour force. Many travel and tour operators and other travel-related companies have a head office in Larnaca.

==Education==

There are over a hundred educational institutions in the city, including the American Academy, Larnaca Nareg Armenian school and the Alexander College.

==Culture==

== Cuisine and seafood ==
The beaches of Larnaca are lined with nearly identical seafood restaurants catering to tourists. Although there are many continental and international restaurants in Larnaca, visitors do not miss out on indulging in the local food. Many of the staple dishes involve beans, such as &quot;fasolaki&quot; (French beans cooked in red wine with lamb), and &quot;louvi me lahana&quot; (black-eyed peas with chard).

Some of the standard appetizers are potato salad, kohlrabi salad, and hot grilled black olives. The next course may include Cyprus village sausage and sheftalia, dolmades and keftedes, kolokassi in tomato sauce, and several aubergine-based dishes. Baked or grilled lamb (&quot;souvla&quot;) usually appears somewhere in the course of dining, as does some kind of fish.

<text>Cecilia Carolina Bolocco Fonck (born May 19, 1965) is a Chilean actress, TV host and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss Universo Chile 1987 and Miss Universe 1987.

Bolocco has worked as a journalist on the Spanish language edition of CNN, on Telemundo and on various programs for Chilean Television and acted on the soap opera &quot;Morelia&quot;.

Between 2001 and 2011 she was married to the 44th President of Argentina Carlos Menem and they have a son together.

==Early life==
Bolocco was born in Santiago, Chile to Enzo Bolocco Cintolesi, an Arbëreshë (Italo-Albanian) businessman and Rose Marie Fonck Assler. She attended primary and secondary school at Santiago College. She then studied a year of civil engineering at the University of Santiago, Chile, before dropping out to pursue costume design at the INCA-CEA Institute.

==Miss Universe==
Bolocco was selected Miss Chile for Miss Universe on April 20, 1987. On May 26, 1987, she beat 67 contestants to become the first Chilean to win the Miss Universe beauty pageant that was held at the World Trade Centre in Singapore that year. During her year-long reign, she settled in Los Angeles, California. Her reign was the last pageant hosted by Bob Barker.

==After the crown==

Bolocco began a television career in Chile with the show &quot;Porque hoy es sábado&quot; (&quot;Because it&#x27;s Saturday&quot;) on Televisión Nacional de Chile. She then co-hosted &quot;Martes 13&quot; (&quot;Tuesday the 13th&quot;) on Channel 13. The program name is a play on the English idiomatic expression about Friday the 13th, where in Chile the unlucky day is Tuesday the 13th.

In March 1990, Bolocco married American television producer Michael Young in Santiago. The local media covered the event as if it were a royal wedding.

Bolocco moved to Atlanta, Georgia to work as an anchorwoman for the Spanish section at CNN produced for Telemundo Network, in June 1990. Then, she became a full-fledged member of the Telemundo family where she hosted the afternoon lifestyles program &quot;La Buena Vida&quot; (&quot;The Good Life&quot;). The show was merged with another newsmagazine titled &quot;Ocurrió así&quot; (&quot;It Happened This Way&quot;) and &quot;Esta noche con Cecilia Bolocco&quot; (&quot;Tonight With Cecilia Bolocco&quot;) followed, for which she won two Emmy awards.
She then took a starring role as the evil &quot;Karina Lafontaine de Montero&quot; in the Mexican Televisa&#x27;s hit soap opera Morelia, which was aired to more than 70 countries throughout the Americas, including Chile, and Europe.

Around the mid-1990s, Bolocco ended her relationship with husband Michael Young. The marriage was annulled, because no divorce law existed in Chile at the time.

In 1993 Bolocco co-hosted the 1993 Miss Universe pageant in the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City.

In 1995 Bolocco co-hosted the closing night of the 36th Viña del Mar International Song Festival, held every year in Viña del Mar, Chile.

In October 1996, Bolocco took the job as co-host in one of the shows with the highest ratings in Chilean television history, &quot;Viva el lunes&quot; (&quot;Long Live Monday&quot;), alongside Kike Morandé and comedian Álvaro Salas. At the same time, she had a radio show and appeared in her own television show, &quot;La noche de Cecilia&quot; (&quot;The Night of Cecilia&quot;).

Also in 1996 Bolocco was a judge in the 1996 Miss Universe pageant in Las Vegas, Nevada.

In February, 2000, Bolocco became an established hostess for the Viña del Mar Song Festival, with partner and longtime host Antonio Vodanovic.

In August 2001 Bolocco&#x27;s marriage to Young was annulled. On 26 May 2001, Bolocco married former Argentine president Carlos Menem in La Rioja, Argentina, whom she met while interviewing him at the Casa Rosada presidential house in Argentina. On November 19, 2003, their first son, Máximo Saúl Menem Bolocco, was born in Santiago, Chile. They separated in April 2007 and officially divorced in May 2011.
