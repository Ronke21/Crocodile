<text>Daniel Roland Michener (April 19, 1900 – August 6, 1991) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, and diplomat who served as the 20th governor general of Canada from 1967 to 1974.

Michener was born and educated in Alberta. In 1917 he served briefly in the Royal Air Force. He acquired a university degree, then attended the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Michener then returned to Canada and practised law before entering politics. He was elected to the House of Commons in 1953, where he served as speaker from 1957 until 1962, and then served in diplomatic postings between 1964 and 1967. After that he was appointed governor general by Queen Elizabeth II on the recommendation of Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, to replace Georges Vanier, and he occupied the post until succeeded by Jules Léger in 1974. Michener proved to be a populist governor general whose tenure is considered to be a key turning point in the history of his office.

On October 15, 1962, Michener was sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. He then served on the boards of various corporations and charities and sat as Chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University.

==Youth and education==
Daniel Roland Michener was born in Lacombe, Alberta (then part of the Northwest Territories), to Senator Edward Michener and Mary E. Roland. During the First World War, he served as Cadet Company Commander in the Red Deer Cadet Corps from 1916-1917. On June 25, 1918, he attested for service with the Royal Air Force in Toronto as a 3rd Class Air Mechanic. He was posted to the RAF Recruiting Depot on September 30 as a Private 2nd Class. With the end of the war in November, he was removed from active service on December 22, 1918 and discharged as a Private 2nd Class (Cadet Pilot) on January 4, 1919. 

Michener attended the University of Alberta, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Rhodes Scholarship that took him to Hertford College at the University of Oxford. There, he played for the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club and met Lester B. Pearson, who was his lifelong friend. After completing his Master of Arts and Bachelor of Civil Law degrees, Michener returned to Canada, settled in Toronto and practised law. At the same time, he acted as the general secretary for the Rhodes Foundation in Canada between 1936 and 1964 and sat as chairman of the Manitoba Royal Commission on Local Government.

On February 26, 1927, in St. Mary Magdalene Anglican Church, Michener married Norah Willis; the couple had three daughters.

==Political career==
Michener first ran for political office in Ontario&#x27;s 1943 election as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the riding of St. David, but was defeated by William Dennison of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). Michener ran in St. David again in the 1945 election and defeated Dennison this time Michener was then appointed to Premier George Drew&#x27;s cabinet as provincial secretary and registrar of Ontario, being responsible for formalizing cabinet procedures, including agenda and minutes. In the 1948 provincial election, Dennison took St. David back from Michener.

Michener then tried to enter federal politics in the 1949 election but was unsuccessful. He tried again in the election of 1953 and was elected in the riding of St. Paul&#x27;s. In 1956, the Progressive Conservative party chose John Diefenbaker as its leader at its leadership convention, and in the election the following year the Tories attained a minority government. Michener was appointed speaker of the House of Commons, after the post was turned down by Stanley Knowles.

As Speaker, Michener angered Diefenbaker by allowing the opposition a great degree of latitude during Question Period; at one point, on May 25, 1959, Diefenbaker was so flustered that he refused to sit down when called to order by Michener. Actions like these, among others, impressed parliamentary observers and a group of university professors initiated a campaign to make Michener&#x27;s position as speaker permanent; they proposed that, as is the tradition with the Speaker of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, Michener run as an independent in general elections and that the political parties agree not to run candidates against him. No such agreement, however came to pass, and when Michener ran for re-election in 1962 he was defeated. This was the first time since 1867 that a speaker had lost his riding in an election in which his party formed the government. Michener returned to Toronto and dedicated his time to his law practice, Lang Michener LLP.

In the 1963 federal election the Liberal Party under Michener&#x27;s old friend, Lester Pearson, won a minority in the House. A year later, Pearson advised Governor General Georges Vanier to appoint Michener to the diplomatic post of high commissioner to India, which Michener took up on July 9, 1964. Six months later Michener became Canada&#x27;s first ambassador to Nepal. While stationed on those foreign duties, Michener was told by the Prime Minister that he would be considered among the leading candidates for the post of Governor General when he returned to Canada. But Vanier was in poor health and, though he offered to stay on as viceroy through to the end of the Canadian Centennial celebrations, Pearson did not wish to advise Queen Elizabeth II to allow it. The night after he conferred with the prime minister about that matter, Vanier died on March 5 at Rideau Hall, leaving Chief Justice Robert Taschereau as Administrator of the Government in the absence of a viceroy.

==Governor General of Canada==
Michener was immediately recalled from India and, on March 29, 1967, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Michener as the Governor General on Pearson&#x27;s advice. Although he was a Conservative, Liberal members of parliament and cabinet ministers welcomed the selection of Michener; Paul Martin Sr. said, &quot;I don’t think there was anybody inside or outside the public service who could qualify better than Michener... People just felt that this was a good appointment.&quot; Michener was sworn in during a ceremony in the Senate chamber on April 17, after one of the shortest periods served by a Governor General-designate.

Only ten days after Michener was made viceroy, he opened Expo 67 in Montreal. The exposition, held on the 100th anniversary of Confederation, attracted fifty-three heads of state and numerous other dignitaries; as the representative of Canada&#x27;s head of state, Michener greeted and held audience with each of them. Among the guests were United States President Lyndon B. Johnson; Princess Grace of Monaco; former US First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy; Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia; and French president Charles de Gaulle. Michener welcomed de Gaulle when he landed at his first stop in Canada, Quebec City, and was present when the French president declared &quot;Vive le Québec libre&quot; to a crowd at Montreal City Hall. The crowd cheered de Gaulle wildly, but booed and jeered Michener when the Royal Anthem, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, was played at his arrival.
Within less than a year of his becoming viceroy, Michener found himself faced with a constitutional crisis when Pearson&#x27;s government was unexpectedly defeated on a tax bill in February 1968. Had the government been unable to pass a full budget bill, then Pearson would have been legally required to resign or ask for a new election, but the conventions relating to lesser financial bills were less clear. After taking much legal advice, Michener decreed that he would not ask for Pearson&#x27;s resignation unless an explicit motion of no confidence against the government was passed. Opposition leader Robert Stanfield immediately tabled such a motion, but it ultimately failed after the other main opposition parties, the New Democratic Party and Ralliement créditiste, declined to support the motion. An election nonetheless took place in June of that year, following Pearson&#x27;s retirement and replacement by Pierre Trudeau.

In October 1970, members of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) kidnapped British trade commissioner James Cross and Quebec&#x27;s minister of labour, Pierre Laporte, thus sparking the October Crisis. In 2010, in interviews with Jacques Lanctôt, Jacques Rose, and other involved in the kidnappings, done for a documentary aired on &quot;Tout le monde en parle&quot;, it was revealed that Michener had been the FLQ&#x27;s intended target; it was alleged that the FLQ leaders planned to commandeer the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Télévision de Radio-Canada and conduct a 24-hour telethon with the Governor General bound in a chair as a prop on the stage. Upon the kidnappings, Michener, as Governor-in-Council, invoked the War Measures Act, and Quebec police, with the support of the Canadian Forces, rounded up hundreds of individuals, leading to the detention of the kidnappers and their accomplices.

On July 1, 1967, the Order of Canada was created, and Michener became the order&#x27;s first member, as well as the first chancellor and principal companion. As such, he presided over the first investiture ceremony, at Rideau Hall, on July 9, investing 90 people into the order. On a visit to London, United Kingdom, he presented the insignia of the Sovereign of the order to Queen Elizabeth II. On July 1, 1972, the Order of Military Merit was founded and Michener was appointed the first Chancellor and Commander.
Another first was Michener&#x27;s state visit in 1971 to Trinidad and Tobago; while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II had both carried out state visits on behalf of Canada and previous governors general had made official visits abroad, no Canadian governor general had ever previously undertaken such a trip. In October of the same year, the Governor General visited Iran to attend the Iranian monarchy&#x27;s 2,500th anniversary. These voyages initially caused controversy among diplomatic insiders in Ottawa, who viewed it as inappropriate for someone who was not the country&#x27;s head of state to undertake a state visit. However, the successes of the trip helped end the controversy, and established a precedent thereafter followed in Canada, and adopted by other Commonwealth realms.

===Legacy===
Though he wore the elaborate court uniform for state occasions, Michener discontinued the practice of women curtseying before the governor general, a move that was rumoured to have been inspired by the refusal of Maryon Pearson, wife of Prime Minister Lester Pearson, to defer thus to her long-time friends. He also fostered links between his position and those of the lieutenant-governors of the provinces by holding periodic meetings with them, starting in 1973. He was, however, criticized for not reacting to Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s &quot;contemptuous musings&quot; about the Crown and the governor general.

Michener created two awards to be bestowed on Canadians. Reflecting his interest in sport fishing, he formed the Michener Tuna Trophy and, in demonstration of his strong relationship with many reporters and journalists, he founded in 1970 the Michener Award for Journalism. In return, besides being bestowed with a number of honours by both the Queen-in-Council and private organizations, Michener became the second of only two Canadians, after former governor general Vincent Massey, to be presented with the Royal Victorian Chain, a personal gift of the monarch, awarded to him by Queen Elizabeth II for his service.

==Retirement and death==
After his term as governor general, Michener and his wife moved to Toronto. They lived at 24 Thornwood Road in the Rosedale neighbourhood. Michener remained active in business throughout the country; he sat on boards of directors and promoted Canadian charities and cultural institutions. From 1973 to 1980, he served as chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University, and he promoted physical activity to school children and seniors alike. To provide an example to follow, he, at the age of 80, climbed to the peak of Alberta&#x27;s Mount Michener, to participate in the ceremony marking the Alberta Crown-in-Council&#x27;s naming of the mountain after him. In 1990, he also agreed to allow his name to be used by the Michener Institute.

In the mid-1980s, Michener became a caretaker for his wife after she was afflicted with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She died in Toronto on January 12, 1987, and Michener followed on August 6, 1991. Their ashes repose in St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Anglican Church in Ottawa, directly across Sussex Drive from Rideau Hall.

<text>Anne Michaels (born 15 April 1958) is a Canadian poet and novelist whose work has been translated and published in over 45 countries. Her books have garnered dozens of international awards including the Orange Prize, the Guardian Fiction Prize, the Lannan Award for Fiction and the Commonwealth Poetry Prize for the Americas. She is the recipient of honorary degrees, the Guggenheim Fellowship and many other honours. She has been shortlisted for the Governor General&#x27;s Award, the Griffin Poetry Prize, twice shortlisted for the Giller Prize and twice long-listed for the International Dublin Literary Award. Michaels won a 2019 Vine Award for &quot;Infinite Gradation&quot;, her first volume of non-fiction. Michaels was the poet laureate of Toronto, Ontario, Canada from 2016 to 2019, and she is perhaps best known for her novel &quot;Fugitive Pieces&quot;, which was adapted for the screen in 2007. Michaels won the 2024 Giller Prize for her novel &quot;Held.&quot;
==Early life==
Anne Michaels was born in Toronto, Ontario, in 1958. She attended Vaughan Road Academy and then later the University of Toronto, where she is an adjunct faculty member in the Department of English.

==Career==
With her first two poetry collections, &quot;The Weight of Oranges&quot; and &quot;Miner&#x27;s Pond&quot;, Michaels gained attention as a writer who balances technical precision with profound meditation and humanity. The recipient of the Commonwealth Poetry Prize for the Americas and the Canadian Authors&#x27; Association Award, and a finalist for both the Governor General&#x27;s Award and the Trillium Award, Michaels secured her place among the finest Canadian poets early in her career.

Following her early success with poetry, Michaels found herself &quot;bumping up more frequently against its limits. [She] was pushing the form as far as [she] could in longer pieces, trying to make connections on a larger scale. [She] stretched poetry as far as it would go in terms of length.&quot; Her debut novel, &quot;Fugitive Pieces&quot; (1996), offered Michaels the opportunity to work more expansively with complicated questions related to history, identity, location, and grief: &quot;a way of layering things; of having images and gestures that connect between page 100 and page 303. It [gave her] the chance to bring readers in slowly, via as many strands as [she could].&quot;

With &quot;Fugitive Pieces&quot;, Michaels lays the thematic foundation of her future works, exploring the relationship between history and memory, and how we, as a people, remember. She also launches her meditation on &quot;what love makes us capable of, and incapable of,&quot; and the paradoxical understanding that &quot;there is nothing a man will not do to another; nothing a man will not do for another.&quot; Confronting the horrors of war, violence, dislocation, and loss through her writing, Michaels &quot;travels with the reader through terrain that is philosophically, morally and emotionally perilous&quot; and refuses to publish unless she can &quot;in some way deliver the reader and [herself] to the other side.&quot; She writes: &quot;We don&#x27;t need repeated proof of violence or horror - a single incident convinces us - but we do need proof, again and again, of the strength, the power, the reach, and the consequences of love.&quot;

&quot;Fugitive Pieces,&quot; the story of a holocaust survivor trying to find his way back into the world, went on to be critically acclaimed internationally, winning the Orange Prize for Fiction, the Guardian Fiction Prize, the Lannan Literary Award for Fiction, the Trillium Book Award, the Books in Canada First Novel Award, the City of Toronto Book Award, the Heritage Toronto Award of Merit, the Martin and Beatrice Fischer Award, the Harold Ribalow Award, the Giuseppe Acerbi Literary Award and the Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize.

While working on her second novel, &quot;The Winter Vault&quot;, Michaels released &quot;Skin Divers&quot;, her third poetry collection and the last of three volumes, beginning with &quot;The Weight of Oranges&quot; and &quot;Miner&#x27;s Pond.&quot; All three were intended to speak to one another, and were later published in &quot;Poems&quot; (2000)&quot;.&quot; Notable for her poetic style, both in her poetry and prose, Michaels writes that &quot;[poetry is] such a good discipline for a novelist: it makes you aware that even if you have four or five hundred pages to play with, you mustn&#x27;t waste a single word.&quot;

During this period, Michaels also began writing for the stage. A collaboration with John Berger led to the development of &quot;Vanishing Points&quot; (2005), a profound meditation on railways, love and loss, directed by Simon McBurney, produced by Complicite and presented in the historic German Gymnasium in King&#x27;s Cross. This work was later published as &quot;Railtracks&quot; (2011). She also contributed the libretto to Canadian composer Omar Daniel&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of Lavinia Andronicus&quot; (2005), offering a new dimension to the tragic figure at the centre of one of Shakespeare&#x27;s most harrowing plays in a performance by the Hilliard Ensemble and Tafelmusik Chamber Choir.

Michaels would not publish &quot;The Winter Vault&quot; until 2009, thirteen years following the release of &quot;Fugitive Pieces&quot; which, likewise, took nearly a decade to write. Like &quot;Fugitive Pieces,&quot; her second novel considers deeply the &quot;complicated relationship between huge historic events and intimate, domestic events; the relationship between historical grief and personal grief; how we remember privately, and how we remember - and memorialize – publicly, collectively. Each community, each nation, faces this question and answers it in its own way, according to its own needs.&quot;

Connecting three historic events - the dismantling and reconstruction of Egypt&#x27;s Abu Simbel Temple; the building of the St. Lawrence Seaway in Canada and the drowning of towns, villages and graves; and the rebuilding of Warsaw after World War II - the novel considers whether a temple, taken apart stone by stone and rebuilt, is the same temple; a river barraged, the same river; a city reconstructed, the same city; and whether the heart can be repaired and rebuilt after a profound personal loss. &quot;The Winter Vault&quot; went on to garner international praise and was a finalist for the Scotiabank Giller Prize, the Trillium Book Award and the Commonwealth Prize, and was also long-listed for the International Dublin Literary Award.

In 2011, Michaels contributed to the Bush Theatre&#x27;s 24-hour performance of &quot;Sixty-Six Books&quot; to mark the 400th anniversary of the King James Bible, providing 66 playwrights, poets, songwriters, and novelists - of all faiths and none, from over a dozen countries and across five continents - the opportunity to respond to some of the oldest stories ever told. Her contribution, &quot;The Crossing,&quot; was later anthologized in &quot;Sixty-Six Books: 21st Century Writers Speak to the King James Bible&quot; (2011)&quot;.&quot; An extract from &quot;The Crossing&quot; was also performed at Westminster Abbey&#x27;s King James Bible Service for Her Majesty The Queen, His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh and His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.

Michaels returned to poetry with the release of her book-length poem, &quot;Correspondences&quot; (2013), an historic and personal elegy in an accordion-style format that can be read frontwards or backwards. A collaboration with artist Bernice Eisenstein, &quot;Correspondences&quot; alternates poetry with haunting portraits of the 20th century writers and thinkers to whom Michaels&#x27; pays tribute. The work went on to receive the Helen and Stan Vine Book Award and was shortlisted for the Griffin Poetry Prize.

In October 2015, Michaels began her tenure as the poet laureate of Toronto, succeeding George Elliott Clarke. Her personal mandate is to provide a platform for Toronto&#x27;s many tongues: &quot;How do we make a space for all these literatures that have come to us in such tremendous largesse, such tremendous richness? We need Torontonians to bring their cultures, bring their poets to us, so we have access to that huge international library.&quot; 2015 also saw the release of Michaels&#x27; first children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Adventures of Miss Petitfour&quot;, with its follow-up, &quot;The Further Adventures of Miss Petitfour&quot;, being released in 2022.

In 2017, a new collection of poetry, &quot;All We Saw,&quot; and a new work of non-fiction, &quot;Infinite Gradation&quot; (with afterword by poet Gareth Evans) were published. Both books were shortlisted for the 2019 Vine Awards for Canadian Jewish Literature in the Poetry and Non-Fiction categories respectively. &quot;Infinite Gradation&quot; won the Non-Fiction prize.

Michaels published her third novel, &quot;Held&quot;, in November 2023. It was shortlisted for the 2024 Booker Prize, and won the 2024 Giller Prize.

In 2023, she was elected as a Royal Society of Literature International Writer

<text>Kuntao or kuntau (, ) is a Hokkien term for the martial arts of the Chinese community of Southeast Asia, specifically the Malay Archipelago. It is most commonly practiced in and associated with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.

==Etymology==
There are no standard hanzi for kuntao, but the most common reading is &quot;way of the fist&quot;, from &quot;kun&quot; 拳 meaning fist and &quot;tao&quot; 道 meaning way. Less common readings may use the character &quot;kun&quot; 棍 meaning staff, or &quot;tou&quot; 头 meaning head, so that it could be translated as &quot;way of the staff&quot; or roughly &quot;knowledge of fists&quot;. In Fujian and other southern areas, this term was originally used for Chinese martial arts in general and was synonymous with &quot;quanfa&quot; (拳法, Pe̍h-ōe-jī: kûn-hoat). The word is recorded in Classical Malay and Indonesian, making it the oldest known term for Chinese martial arts in those languages, before the modern adoption of the term &quot;kungfu&quot;. In English, and even in its modern Chinese usage, kuntao usually refers specifically to styles brought to Southeast Asia and often does not include other Chinese fighting systems.

==History==
The presence of Chinese martial arts in the Malay Archipelago traces back to ancient contact between China and Southeast Asia. Donn F. Draeger goes as far as to call them the oldest major organised system of fighting in Indonesia, pre-dating the structured teaching of silat. The Toraja, Batak, and Dayak cultures all show Chinese influence, and Chinese weapons are often depicted in ancient Sumatran art. Some pre-colonial Chinese temples in Indonesia display combative images characteristic of southern Chinese forms, and many techniques and weapons of silat are of Chinese and Indian influence. Many Peranakan families can still trace their clan history in the region as far back as the voyages of Admiral Zheng He, but most Southeast Asian Chinese were brought to the Malay Archipelago as working-class immigrants during the colonial era. In Indonesia in particular, every Chinese community had some form of kuntao, but were traditionally shrouded in secrecy. As recently as the 1970s, kuntao was often practiced secretly to avoid its techniques from being revealed to outsiders, both Chinese and non-Chinese. It was not openly displayed, and public demonstrations would hide the true forms. This changed during the latter of the 20th century, and kuntao is now taught commonly without secrecy. Kuntao was introduced to the US by Martial Artist and Military Veteran Joe Rossi, who learned it from his Filipino Master in World War II. He was taught the martial art as a member of the special forces in the US Navy to apply in Combat operations. Rossi began teaching Kuntao at his private studio in Waterbury, Connecticut after the war. It popularized further, by Willem Reeders and Willem de Thouars in the 1960s.

==Styles==
Both northern and southern Chinese martial arts are represented in kuntao, but the majority of systems originate from the same southern states as the Southeast Asian Chinese communities who practice them. Fujian, Shandong, Kongfu, and Guangdong styles dominate. Some systems were directly imported from China and underwent little or no changes, such as &quot;Pakua&quot; (&quot;baguazhang&quot;) and &quot;Peh-ho&quot; (Fujian White Crane). Among the most common of these are &quot;Saolim&quot; (&quot;Shaolinquan&quot;), &quot;Ngochokun&quot; (&quot;wuzuquan&quot; or Five Ancestors fist), and &quot;Thaikek&quot; (tai chi). Other styles may be a conglomeration of several different schools resulting from the supposition that they had to adapt to the Southeast Asian weapons and environment. The sanchian form is a common fundamental to all major styles of kuntao.

Kuntao in Jakarta is predominantly of Fujian extraction, characterized by their frontal and right stances (right foot advanced). All Fujian stances are based on observations of not just animals but also humans, such as a newborn baby or a drunken man. Unlike the low stances of other systems, Fujian forms primarily switch between the &quot;ting&quot; and &quot;pa&quot; stance, both of which are designed to feel natural with normally-spaced placement of the feet and legs. Shandong styles - practiced across Java and Madura - are Saolim derivatives, identified by their positioning of the thumb atop the clenched fist, as well as their left stances. Their techniques include high kicks, rolling, leaping, and both short and long arm movements. Styles of Kongfu origin (not to be confused with the misunderstood term &quot;kung fu&quot;) are known for their rigidity and static postures. Guangdong styles are fast and energetic, employing flailing arm motions, subtle hand movements, and semiclenched formations for parrying and blocking.

In Malaysia, the word &quot;kuntao&quot; is currently most common in Sarawak but the art itself is widely practiced throughout the country. Both the internal and external systems are well-represented. Most are of Hokkien, Cantonese, Hakka, or Yunnan origin (the latter known in Malay as &quot;Lian Yunan&quot;). Among the oldest are southern Saolim and the three major internal schools (&quot;neijia&quot;), all of which strongly influenced local silat. &quot;Luohanquan&quot; (Arhat fist) and Thaikek dominate. The Chuga Siulam (Chu family Shaolin or phoenix-eye fist) school of Penang is the lineage-holder of the discipline and traces directly back to the art&#x27;s founders. Wengchun (Wing Chun) has become increasingly popular since the early 20th century. Five Ancestors Fist is practiced mainly in the south and is known locally as &quot;Gochoh&quot;. It is the most pervasive style of kuntao in Singapore and the Philippines, though Thaikek is also commonly practiced. Singapore is known for both Hainanese styles as well as Cantonese Hunggakun, particularly the Tiger And Crane form.

Kuntao in Sarawak (spelled locally as kuntau) was disseminated by Sino-Iban and adopted by the wider Iban people. Masters are addressed as &quot;guro&quot; and the training area is an outdoor space called &quot;kelang&quot;. Kuntau remains guarded by secrecy today, seldom shown to the public and rarely taught outside the community. Though traditionally passed within the family, kuntau has dwindled in popularity among the young. There are currently only 24 kelang statewide and 14 styles remain. This includes Lang Nginau, Tepis Memaloh, and Sinding Ujan Panas. The styles known as Spring 12 and Spring 24 closely resemble Wing Chun. As with Lian Padukan, they trace back to a Chinese man from Yunnan. In 2017 the National Iban Kuntau Association (Nika) was formed to preserve Iban kuntau, and has approved selected patterns to be displayed to the public.

Kuntao in the Philippines is spelled as &quot;kuntaw&quot;. Some styles usually trace their lineage to a Buddhist monk named Darmon (based on the Bodhidharma legend) who fled China for Indonesia during the 13th century Mongol invasion. Ngochokun (wuzuquan) and Pakuazen (baguazhang) are prominent while Thaikek (taijiquan) is mainly practiced as a health exercise. Both kuntaw and silat additionally exist as a dance-like Filipino (or exclusively Muslim Mindanao peoples for clarity&#x27;s sake) performance art, while the combative aspect was passed down privately from parent to child. A notable example of this was Carlito A. Lanada, Sr. who inherited the art of &quot;Kuntaw Lima Lima&quot;. He is the son of Yong Iban Lanada, whose father, Yuyong Huenyo came from the Tausug tribe in the southern Muslim island of Mindanao.

==Integrated systems==
Millennia of mutual exchange has at times blurred the line between kuntao and silat. Some schools may use the terms almost interchangeably as in Bali. Others incorporate both words in their name, as with Silat Kuntau Tekpi. In the most extreme cases, a particular lineage is passed down within the indigenous Southeast Asian community until it loses any outward Chinese reference. This has sometimes been intentional, particularly after the Chinese Communist Revolution. Between 1949 and the mid-80s, some schools were rebranded as silat to distance themselves from Maoist China. Additionally, the establishment of Indonesia&#x27;s silat governing body IPSI in 1948 was a motivating factor for martial arts schools to be recognized by the association if they&#x27;re considered silat. The rise of racism in more recent decades has further resulted in alterations to oral traditions and histories, de-emphasising their inception as the product of Chinese culture. The following are examples of such revision. All are characteristically Chinese in their techniques, tactics, and medicinal practices.

===Cingkrik===
From the Betawi word &quot;jingkrik&quot; meaning agile, legend traces Cingkrik to a monkey style of kuntao created by a woman who based the techniques on a group of monkeys she witnessed fighting. In the early 1900s this kuntao eventually reached a man in Rawa Belong named Kong Maing who further developed it after a monkey stole his walking stick and evaded all his attempts at retrieval. The modern revision credits Kong Maing entirely, ignoring its kuntao background.

===Beksi===
Beksi was created in the 1800s by a Tionghoa Peranakan named Lie Cheng Hok, who took both Chinese and native Indonesians as disciples. His successor was a Betawi and it has been passed down in Tangerang ever since. According to the revision, Lie Cheng Hok himself was a student of a mysterious cave-dwelling hermit named Ki Jidan, who is now widely considered the progenitor.

===Kwitang===
Unlike most recent revisions, the dispute over Mustika Kwitang has existed for several decades. All agree that it began with a sparring match between a Tionghoa martial artist named Kwee Tang Kiam and a (traditionally unnamed) Betawi herbalist in the 17th century. The loser would become the winner&#x27;s student, but who won is a topic of contention. Some say Kwee Tang Kiam was the logical victor as the style still carries his name. Others say he lost and married the local man&#x27;s daughter. As the art was passed down within the family, they continued to use the Kwitang name.

===Bangau Putih===
A white crane system founded in Bogor, West Java by Subur Rahardja in 1952. As a young child Subur Rahardja learned martial arts from several teachers, as well as his father and other family members. He was the acknowledged inheritor of five masters from different lineages. Most notably among these was his paternal uncle Liem Kim Bouw, other teachers included Mpe Sutur, the founder of the Cimande Pencak Silat school, Asuk Yak Long, and Gusti Djelantik.

===Lian Yunan===
A family of about 22 styles centered mainly in Johor, Malaysia. They are remarkably similar to Wing Chun with which they share a common origin in Yunnan, China during the 1700s. The most prominent style is Lian Padukan, itself a derivative of Buah Pukul from the Mersing district of Johor. It is said to have been introduced by a Hui man who made a name for himself fighting in the docklands of 1920s Singapore and Johor. Confusion over the Hui identity has led to revisionists replacing the founder&#x27;s Chinese heritage with an Arab one.

===Kuntaw===
Its arrival in the Philippines is unclear for even among the Mindanao people there is no research dedicated to tracing the lineage or the importer of the martial art or when was the first recorded reference of this martial art, and if there is, a question of authenticity arises. The same could be said of &quot;silat&quot; practiced culturally in the southernmost parts of the archipelago. It is safe to say, that is until a new paper is published about retracing its history in the islands, that this fighting method only started to &quot;come out&quot; in the country in the mid-20th century. It is written as &quot;kuntaw&quot; in the Philippines, the Chinese origin of kuntao is rarely denied, but it has often become associated with the Filipino Muslim usually among Maguindanaons, Maranaos and Tausugs but it is also associated with the Filipino Muslim community of Indonesian or Borneo descent, given that the southern Filipinos are more culturally linked to Malays than those Filipinos from Luzon and Visayas. The term is sometimes mistakenly translated as &quot;sacred strike&quot; from &quot;kunsagrado hataw&quot;.

==Weapons==
The vast array of weaponry found in China is naturally reflected in kuntao, the most famous examples being the sword, sabre, staff, spear and butterfly swords. Listed below are some of the weapons used in traditional styles of kuntao. Pronunciation and spelling vary according to dialect and transliteration system used. The Mandarin word-forms are given in parentheses.

*Kiam (jian): straight double-edge sword
*Tou (dao): any single-edge blade, usually referring to the sabre
*Toya (gun): pole, usually of either wood or iron
*Chio (qiang): spear, often with horsehair attached near the blade to prevent blood from dripping to the shaft
*Taichiu: short-handled trident
*Kwan-tou (Guan dao): pole glaive named after Guan Yu of Romance of the Three Kingdoms fame
*Hongkiam-kek (ji): crescent-moon spear
*Hwa-kek: a polearm resembling the ji but with two crescent blades, one on each side of the spear-head
*Sangkau (shuanggou): hook swords
*Sanh-chat (sanjie-gun): staff divided into three sections of equal length and joined together by chain
*Liang-chat (liangjie-gun): chained stick divided into two sections, either one long and one short or a diminutive version in which both are of the same length

<text>Gumbo () is a stew that is popular among the U.S. Gulf Coast community, the New Orleans stew variation being the official state cuisine of the U.S. state of Louisiana. Gumbo consists primarily of a strongly flavored stock, meat or shellfish (or sometimes both), a thickener, and the Creole &quot;holy trinity&quot;: celery, bell peppers, and onions. Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used, whether okra or filé powder (dried and ground sassafras leaves).

Gumbo can be made with or without okra or filé powder. The preferred method in the historical New Orleans variation is with a French dark, even chocolate-like, roux. The flavor of the dish has its origins in many cultures. Creole gumbo generally contains shellfish and a dark roux, filé, or both. Cajun gumbo is generally based on a dark roux and is made with shellfish or fowl. Sausage or ham is often added to gumbos of either variety. After the base is prepared, vegetables are cooked down, and then meat is added. The dish simmers for a minimum of three hours, with shellfish and some spices added near the end. If desired, filé powder is added after the pot is removed from heat. Gumbo is traditionally served with rice. A third, lesser-known variety, the meatless gumbo z&#x27;herbes, is essentially a gumbo of slow-cooked greens.

The dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures, including West African, French, German, Spanish, and Native American Choctaw. Gumbo may have been partially based on the French dish bouillabaisse,West African Okra Stew or Choctaw stew, but most likely all of these dishes contributed to the original recipe. It was first described in 1802, and was listed in various cookbooks in the latter half of the 19th century. The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the United States Senate dining room added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator Allen Ellender. The popularity of chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s spurred further interest in the dish.

==Etymology==
The name of the dish comes most likely from Africa, by way of Louisiana French. Scholars and chefs have offered various explanations for the etymology of the word &quot;gumbo&quot;. The dish was likely named after one of its two main ingredients, okra or filé. According to linguists, &quot;gumbo&quot; has multiple origins. One origin is the Bambara language of West Africa in which &quot;gombo&quot; means okra The other origin is the system of Bantu languages spoken by many enslaved people from Central Africa. The vegetable okra was known as or in Kimbundu; the word is akin to the and the &quot;okra&quot;. Additionally, the native Choctaw people used filé - dried, ground sassafras - leaves to thicken soups and stews. They called sassafras &quot;komho&quot; according to Nobles, and called filé &quot;kombo&quot; according to Usner, or &quot;kombo ashish&quot;, according to Freedman.

==Variations==
Gumbo is a heavily seasoned stew that combines several varieties of meat or seafood with a sauce or gravy. Any combination of meat or seafood can be used. Meat-based gumbo may consist of chicken, duck, squirrel, or rabbit, with oysters occasionally added. Seafood-based gumbo generally has shrimp, crab meat, and sometimes oysters. Andouille sausage is often added to both meat and seafood gumbos to provide &quot;piquancy, substance, and an additional layer of flavor&quot; to the dish. The key is to use a tender andouille so it does not become too chewy.&quot; Most varieties of gumbo are seasoned with onions, bell pepper, and celery. Tomatoes are sometimes used in seafood gumbo, but traditionally few other vegetables are included.

===Thickeners===
Gumbo broth or gravy derives from three primary thickeners: okra, filé powder, and roux. Traditionally, okra and filé powder are not used in the same dish, although this rule is sometimes broken. Roux can be used alone or in conjunction with either of the other thickeners. Okra is more often used as a thickener in seafood gumbos than those with meat. This mucilaginous vegetable is usually cooked first, and other ingredients added once the desired consistency is reached. According to &quot;The Oxford Companion to Food&quot;, okra-based gumbos are becoming less popular, as the okra texture has become less palatable to changing tastes.

Ground sassafras leaf, known as filé, is generally not added to the gravy until after the vegetables and meats or seafood have finished cooking and have been removed from the heat source. Many Cajuns add it at the table rather than in the pot. If added during the boiling process, filé makes the gumbo too ; when added at the end, the gumbo gains a slightly stringy texture.

Roux has become the most popular thickener, made from cooking together a roughly equal proportion of flour and fat (traditionally hog lard, although increasingly made with butter since the mid-20th century). The length of cooking time determines the final flavor and texture, since the longer the roux is cooked before being added to the gumbo, the darker it becomes and the less thickening power it retains. A very dark roux provides a much thinner sauce with a more intense flavor than a light roux.

===Cajun vs. Creole gumbo===
Gumbo is typically divided into two varieties. Combinations traditionally common in New Orleans and southeastern Louisiana are known as &quot;Creole&quot; after the Louisiana Creole people, descendants of the area&#x27;s French, Spanish, and Enslaved Africans. &quot;Cajun&quot; combinations were common in southwestern Louisiana, which was populated primarily by Cajuns, descendants of the French-speaking settlers expelled from Acadia (located within the modern-day Canadian provinces of Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island) in the mid-18th century.

Gumbo is usually identified by its dark roux, cooked until it is a color &quot;a few shades from burning&quot;. The roux is used with okra or filé powder. Seafood is popular in gumbo the closer to the coast the people are, but the southwestern areas of Louisiana often use fowl, such as chicken or duck, and sausage. The fowl is generally not deboned, and onions, celery, and bell pepper are not strained out of the dish. Cajun gumbo is sometimes topped with parsley and green onions.

Creole gumbo most often consists of seafood, tomatoes, and a thickener. Before the latter half of the 20th century, celery was rarely used in Creole gumbo.

===Gumbo z&#x27;herbes===
When Catholics were expected to abstain from eating meat during Lent, a meatless variety of gumbo, known as gumbo z&#x27;herbes (from &quot;gumbo aux herbes&quot;, or &quot;gumbo of greens&quot;), was often served. This variety combined varied greens – typically including turnips, mustard greens, and spinach. The greens were cooked to mush and strained through a sieve to produce a thick green liquid. Preparation for this variety of gumbo was time-consuming, and as Lenten restrictions have relaxed, the dish has become less popular. It is very rarely served in restaurants. In modern times, ham or crabmeat is occasionally added to this type of gumbo.

Gumbo z&#x27;herbes may have originated with the French/Spanish/West Africans. It has similarities to the French dish &quot;potage aux herbes&quot; (&quot;soup with greens&quot;), as well as to the Afro-Caribbean callaloo. The meatless dish also bears striking resemblance to a dish often eaten in Germany on Maundy Thursday. German Catholics, obeying the Lenten rules, often served a stew made of seven different greens on this date.

==History==

===Background===
Gumbo is often used as a metaphor for the mix of cultures that exist in southern Louisiana. The dish combines the culinary practices of Africans, Native Americans, German, French, and Spanish. In the 18th and 19th centuries, people from these cultures lived within a fairly small area with minimal mobility. In this environment, cultures could influence each other and combine to create new traditions and cuisine.

The establishment of Mobile in 1702 marked the beginning of the French colony of Louisiana. French settlers allied with various native tribes including the Choctaw, Alabama, and Cherokee, from whom they learned new methods of cooking and ways to identify edible indigenous plants.

Slave ships began arriving in Louisiana in 1719. The first ships carried rice and men who were experienced in its cultivation. The grain adapted well to its new environment, and within a few years, rice was commonly grown along the Mississippi River.

In 1721, 125 Germans settled from New Orleans, and introduced the art of making sausage. By 1746, the white population of Louisiana was estimated to be 3,200, with an estimated 4,730 black people. Enslaved Africans outnumbered whites in most areas of Louisiana for at least the next 40 years.

The colony was transferred from French to Spanish control in 1762. The Spanish government actively recruited settlers for Spanish Louisiana. About 2,000 people from the Canary Islands moved to the area south of New Orleans. These settlers were primarily fishermen who soon began supplying large amounts of shrimp, crab, and oysters to the food markets in New Orleans. The Canary Islanders also brought &quot;a love for well-seasoned food&quot;, including use of ground cayenne pepper, a spicy hot red chili pepper. Spanish authorities also granted permission for many French-speaking Acadian exiles to relocate from northeastern North America to Louisiana. From 1755 through 1795, almost 3,000 of these settlers, soon known as Cajuns, moved to the areas south and west of New Orleans. Louisiana was secretly returned to France in 1800, then purchased by the United States in 1803. The southernmost part of territorial Louisiana, including New Orleans, became the state of Louisiana in 1812.

By 1800, the slave trade had introduced new foods to Louisiana, including the African vegetable okra, and hot pepper plants which likely came from Haiti. Onions and bell peppers were long part of cooking in both the Spanish and African traditions. Tomatoes were introduced to the region shortly thereafter.

===Origin===
Scholars agree that gumbo originated in Louisiana in the early 18th century, but its uncertain etymology makes it difficult to pinpoint the origins of the food. Although no conclusive evidence exists, cultural markers indicate several plausible scenarios.

As aforementioned, while its exact origins are unknown, gumbo is often believed to be a dish of mixed origins of African, French, Spanish, Native American, Caribbean and German influence. Enslaved African Americans often exchanged or combined ingredients in order to make the dish, allowing it to serve as a means of community and identity.

West Africans use the vegetable okra as a base for many dishes, including soups. In Louisiana, gumbo includes ingredients introduced by several cultural groups. Surviving records indicate that by 1764 Africans in New Orleans mixed cooked okra with rice to make a meal.

Gumbo could be a derivation of traditional French soups, particularly the fish stew bouillabaisse. During the cold winters, Acadians generally cooked soups, using whatever ingredients were readily available. When the Acadians moved to Louisiana in the mid-18th century, they were unable to find many of their traditional ingredients, including turnips and cabbage. In this scenario, Acadian colonists substituted local ingredients for those commonly included in the original stew. Instead of the fish, settlers used shellfish. The dish was later modified to include ingredients common in other cultures.

Some culinary experts in the early 20th century, including Celestine Eustis, maintained that gumbo was an early special occasion dish for native tribes. This is further implied by a late 18th-century Cajun practice. At that time, rice was a luxury for many Cajuns. They served gumbo over corn grits, a pairing common in the stews of native tribes. The use of corn and filé powder may imply that the dish was derived from native cuisine.

These theories are intermixed in the local legend of the Frying Pan Revolt, or Petticoat Insurrection. According to legend, in 1722, female French colonists gathered in New Orleans at the home of Governor Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, to protest the lack of familiar ingredients. Bienville&#x27;s housekeeper, Madame Langlois, taught the women how to improve the basic gumbo. Langlois used okra, an ingredient which the women had previously been introduced to by the African people they were enslaving. Spanish and Choctaw introduced ingredients common in Choctaw cuisine – shrimp, crawfish, and filé powder.

===Development===
The first written references to gumbo appear in the early 19th century. In 1802, John Sibley described &quot;the dish they call gumbo which is made principally of the ochre into a thick kind of soop &amp; eat with rice, it is the food of every body for dinner and supper.&quot; The following year, French governor Pierre Clement de Laussat hosted a soirée in which 24 different gumbos were prepared. According to author Cynthia Lejeune Nobles, these two events &quot;give clues to gumbo&#x27;s Spanish colonial popularity and illustrate that the dish could be both humble and refined&quot;.

An 1824 cookbook, Mary Randolph&#x27;s &quot;The Virginia House-Wife&quot;, was the first to include a recipe for gumbo. Called &quot;Gumbo – A West India Dish&quot;, the simple recipe described how to boil okra and bore little resemblance to the stew commonly known as gumbo. The same book contained a recipe for &quot;Ochra Soup&quot; made with okra, onions, fowl, bacon, tomatoes, and lima beans thickened with flour. Although this recipe bore similarities to gumbo, it more closely resembled the Caribbean dish callaloo.

A more familiar version of the dish was described in an 1879 cookbook by Marion Cabell Tyree. Her &quot;Housekeeping in Old Virginia&quot; described &quot;Gumbo Filit A La Creole&quot;, a filé-based gumbo with chicken and oysters and spiced with allspice, cloves, red and black pepper, parsley, and thyme. The 1881 cookbook &quot;What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking&quot;, dictated by former slave Abby Fisher, contained three gumbo recipes. &quot;Oyster Gumbo Soup&quot; used a filé base, while &quot;Ochra Gumbo&quot; and &quot;Chicken Gumbo&quot; used okra as a base. Four years later, the cookbook &quot;La Cuisine Creole&quot; documented eight varieties of gumbo. None used sausage, but almost all of them contained ham.

Until the 1970s, gumbo was primarily popular on the Gulf Coast of the United States. It gained a broader profile after the death of United States Senator Allen Ellender. A native of Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, Ellender had often cooked gumbo for his colleagues, including five American presidents. After Ellender died in 1972, the Senate directed that their cafeteria add Louisiana Creole Gumbo, made with seafood, to its menu in his honor. The dish became more widely popular in the 1980s, when chef Paul Prudhomme&#x27;s popularity spurred interest in Creole and Cajun cooking.

==Preparation and serving==
Gumbo is cooked for a minimum of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned beforehand and removed from the heat. Okra and roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. 

According to Nobles, &quot;proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art&quot;. Because seafood cooks fairly quickly, it is not added to the pot until the end of the process. As the gumbo finishes cooking, green onions and parsley are sometimes sprinkled on it. When desired, filé powder is added last.

Creole and Cajun gumbos are served with hot rice, which stretches the quantity of the dish for maximum portion sizes. Gumbo z&#x27;herbes is served with rice on the side. Gumbo is almost always served directly from the pot on the stove, although in wealthier or fancier homes the dish might be transferred to a tureen on the table. Often, gumbo and bread are the sole courses in a meal, although many Cajun families provide a side dish of potato salad. Some Cajun families prefer their gumbo served over potato salad instead of rice. Occasionally, gumbo is served as part of a larger menu.

Soniat gives examples of the main types of creole gumbos, along with descriptions of family traditions about them.

==Social aspects==
In &quot;Cajun Foodways&quot;, C. Paige Gutierrez describes gumbo as &quot;an economical dish&quot; useful for &quot;feed[ing] a large number of people with a small amount of meat or seafood&quot;. Nobles concurs that &quot;one of the hallmarks of gumbo is that, with a big enough pot, it can easily be doubled or tripled and is always a good choice to feed a crowd&quot;. With this dish, cooks can use up small portions of various ingredients that were not sufficient for an individual meal. The dish is an efficient way to use up leftover perishable meats and seafood. Gumbo, contrary to popular belief, is good for leftovers if it is frozen or refrigerated within two hours. Also, gumbo made without filé powder stores better because it will not get stringy.

Since the 19th century, gumbo has often been served at social gatherings or other special occasions in Louisiana. Local fais do-do (dance parties) usually provided gumbo beginning at midnight. Many families &quot;have a gumbo&quot;, or host a casual social gathering where friends and family chat and enjoy alcoholic beverages and gumbo.

Gumbo is prepared and enjoyed by Louisianians of all races and ethnicities, and its multicultural influences have evolved it through the years. Gumbo is a feature in both urban and rural areas of Louisiana.

In rural Acadiana in southern Louisiana, gumbo is a central feature of Mardi Gras celebrations. On Mardi Gras, local men wander from house to house and beg for gumbo ingredients in an event known as courir de Mardi Gras. Members of the local community then gather in a central location while the men cook the gumbo. When it is ready, the group eats and dances until midnight, when Lent begins.

Gumbo is the official cuisine of the state of Louisiana. Many southern Louisiana cooking competitions center around gumbo, and it is a central feature of many local festivals. The self-described &quot;Gumbo Capital of the World&quot;, Bridge City, Louisiana, holds an annual Gumbo Festival. The festival features gumbo cooked in a cast-iron pot 3 ft (0.9 m) deep and in diameter. More commonly, festival gumbo pots measure 2 ft (0.6 m) in depth and diameter.

<text>Roy Akira Miki (10 October 1942 – 5 October 2024) was a Canadian poet, scholar, editor, and activist most known for his social and literary work.

==Life and career==
Born in Ste. Agathe, Manitoba to second generation Japanese-Canadian parents, Miki grew up on a sugar beet farm before moving to Winnipeg. His family was forcibly relocated West to Manitoba where he was born in 1942 on said sugar beet farm, and interned during the Second World War. He earned his B.A. from the University of Manitoba, M.A. from the Simon Fraser University, and Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia. Miki taught contemporary literature at Simon Fraser University before retiring and held the title of professor emeritus. He lived in Vancouver. In the 1980s, Miki was &quot;instrumental&quot; in fighting for redress from the federal government for the internment of Japanese-Canadians during the Second World War.

In 2002, Miki&#x27;s book of poetry, &quot;Surrender&quot;, won the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award for poetry. His poetry focuses on questions about identity, citizenship, race, and place. He is the author of the critical study, &quot;Broken Entries: Race, Subjectivity, Writing&quot; (1998), &quot;In Flux: Transnational Shifts in Asian Canadian Writing&quot; (2011), &quot;The Prepoetics of William Carlos Williams&quot; (1983), and an annotated bibliography of the poet and novelist &quot;George Bowering&quot; (1990).

In 2006, Miki was made a Member of the Order of Canada and received the 20th annual Gandhi Peace Award for the truth, justice, human rights, and non-violence exemplified in his redress work. The same year, he also received the Thakore Visiting Scholar award and the Sterling Prize in Support of Controversy. In 2007, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2009, he was made a Member of the Order of British Columbia.

Miki died on 5 October 2024, at the age of 82.

<doc id="289770" wikidata="Q1266046" url="?curid=289770" title="Eutychius of Constantinople">
<text>Eutychius of Constantinople (, &quot;Eutychios&quot;; 512 – 5 April 582), considered a saint in the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Christian traditions, was the patriarch of Constantinople from 552 to 565 and from 577 to 582. His feast is kept by the Orthodox Church on 6 April, and he is mentioned in the Catholic Church&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Corpus Juris&quot;&quot;. His terms of office, occurring during the reign of Emperor Justinian I, were marked by controversies with both imperial and papal authority.

== Early life ==
Eutychius&#x27; career is well documented: a full biography, composed by his chaplain Eustathius of Constantinople, was preserved intact. Eutychius was born at Theium in Phrygia. His father, Alexander, was a general under the famous Byzantine commander Belisarius. Eutychius became a monk at Amasea at the age of 30. As an archimandrite at Constantinople, Eutychius was well respected by Menas of Constantinople, the Patriarch of Constantinople. Eventually, on the day Menas died, Eutychius was nominated by Emperor Justinian I as Patriarch.

== First patriarchate ==
Pope Vigilius was in Constantinople when Eutychius became patriarch. Eutychius sent him the usual announcement of his own appointment and a completely orthodox profession of the then-united Church. At the same time, the Pope urged him to summon and preside over the Church Council summoned to deal with the Three-Chapter Controversy. Vigilius first gave, and then withdrew, his consent to the Council. In spite of the Pope&#x27;s refusal, the council met on 5 May 553 at Constantinople, and Eutychius shared the first place in the assembly with Patriarch Apollinarius of Alexandria and Domnus of Antioch (called &quot;Domnus III&quot;, see List of Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch). At the second session, the pope excused himself again on the grounds of ill health. The subscription of Eutychius to the Acts of this synod, which was later recognized as the Second Council of Constantinople and which concluded on 2 June 553, is a summary of the decrees against the Three Chapters.

Eutychius had, so far, stood by the Emperor throughout. He composed the decree of the Council against The Three Chapters. In 562, he consecrated the new church of Hagia Sophia. However, Eutychius came into violent collision with Justinian I in 564, when the Emperor adopted the tenets of the Aphthartodocetae, a sect of Non-Chalcedonians who believed that Christ&#x27;s body on earth was incorruptible () and subject to no pain.

Eutychius, in a long address, argued the incompatibility of the Aphthartodocetic beliefs with Scripture. Emperor Justinian I insisted that he subscribe to it anyway. When Eutychius refused to compromise, Justinian I ordered his arrest. On 22 January 565, Eutychius was celebrating the feast day of Saint Timothy in the church adjoining the Hormisdas Palace when soldiers broke into the patriarchal residence, entered the church, and carried him away.

== Arrest and exile ==
Eutychius was first removed to a monastery called Choracudis, and the next day to the monastery of St. Osias near Chalcedon. Eight days later Justinian called an assembly of princes and prelates, to which he summoned Eutychius. The charges against him were trivial: that he used ointments, ate &quot;delicate meats&quot;, and prayed for long periods. After being summoned three times, Eutychius replied that he would only come if he were to be judged canonically, in his own dignity, and in command of his clergy. Condemned by default, he was sent to an island in the Propontis named Principus (&quot;Princes&#x27; Islands&quot;), and later to his old monastery at Amasea, where he spent 12 years and 5 months.

== Return and second patriarchate ==
Upon the death of John Scholasticus, whom Justinian I had put in the patriarchal chair, the people of Constantinople demanded the return of Eutychius. Emperor Justin II had succeeded Justinian I in 565 and had associated with himself the young Tiberius II Constantine, who was made Caesar in 574. In October 577 the two emperors sent a delegation to Amasea to bring Eutychius back to Constantinople. Contemporary reports claim that as he entered the city, a large group of people met him, shouting aloud, &quot;Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord,&quot; and &quot;Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace&quot;. In imitation of the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem (recorded in Matthew 21:1–11 and John 12:12–18), he entered the city on an ass&#x27;s colt, over garments spread on the ground, the crowd carrying palms, dancing, and singing. The whole city was illuminated, public banquets were held, and new buildings were inaugurated.

The next day he met with the two emperors and was given &quot;conspicuous honor&quot; at the Church of the Virgin in Blachernae. He then proceeded to Hagia Sophia, mounted the pulpit, and blessed the many people. It took him six hours to distribute the communion because all of the people wished to receive it from his own hands.

== Late beliefs and death ==
Toward the end of his life, Eutychius maintained an opinion that after the resurrection the body will be &quot;more subtle than air&quot; and no longer a tangible thing. This was considered heretical because it was taken as a denial of the doctrine of physical, corporeal resurrection. The future Pope Gregory I, then residing at Constantinople as Apocrisiarius, opposed this opinion, citing Luke 24:39. Emperor Tiberius II Constantine talked to the disputants separately and tried to reconcile them, but the breach was persistent.

Eutychius died quietly on the Sunday after Easter, at the age of 70. Some of his friends later told Pope Gregory I that a few minutes before his death he touched the skin of his hand and said, &quot;I confess that in this flesh we shall rise again&quot; (a rough quote of Job 19:26).

Among his pupils was Eustratius of Constantinople who wrote a tract against soul sleep.

== Extant works by Eutychius ==
His literary remains are:
* Letter to Pope Vigilius (Jacques Paul Migne, Patrologia Latina, LXIX, 63, Patrologia Latina, LXXXVI, 2401);
* &quot;Discourse on Easter&quot; (fragment), (Mai: Class. Auct. X, 488, and Script. Vet. Nov Coll. IX, 623); and other fragments found in P.G., LXXXVI.

<doc id="289772" wikidata="Q1376802" url="?curid=289772" title="Eutychius (exarch)">
<text>Eutychius () was the last Exarch of Ravenna, heading the Exarchate from 726 or 727 until 751.

== Arrival in Italy and first struggles ==

The Exarchate of Ravenna had risen in revolt in 726 at the imposition of iconoclasm; the Exarch Paul lost his life attempting to quash the revolt. In response, Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717–741) sent the eunuch Eutychius to take control of the situation. In certain historical works, Eutychius is mentioned as having served as exarch already in 710/11–713, between the tenures of John III Rizocopus and Scholasticus. This is however a modern interpolation based on an erroneous reading of the &quot;Liber pontificalis&quot;. Eutychius landed in Naples, where he called upon loyal citizens to assassinate Pope Gregory II. When the citizens responded by pledging to defend the Pope and to die in his defense, Eutychius turned his attention to the Lombards, offering King Liutprand and the Lombard dukes bribes if they would abandon Pope Gregory. Despite all of this, according to Jeffrey Richards, Pope Gregory persisted in his efforts to preserve imperial rule in Italy.

Eutychius&#x27;s efforts eventually gained results: King Liutprand came to an agreement with the Exarch, and agreed to support him in return for assistance in subjecting the duchies of Benevento and Spoleto. Pope Gregory, however, met with Liutprand, and convinced him to abandon the effort, then with Liutprand&#x27;s help effected a reconciliation with Eutychius. When one Tiberius Petasius proclaimed himself emperor in Tuscia and Eutychius found himself critically short of manpower, Pope Gregory ordered the Roman army to help him put down the rebellion, and Petasius was killed.

==Exile and appeal for help==
Conflict with the Lombards resulted in disaster in 737, when the exarchate&#x27;s capital, Ravenna, was seized by Liutprand. Further warfare erupted in 739. Pope Gregory III had supported the dukes of Benevento and Spoleto against Liutprand, causing the latter to invade central Italy. The exarchate, as well as the Duchy of Rome, was ravaged and Ravenna fell to the Lombards; Eutychius was forced to seek refuge in the Venetian islands. He appealed to the inhabitants to help liberate Ravenna, and the Venetian fleet sailed with him to recover the city.

==Papal intervention in Ravenna==
Shortly after the accession of Pope Zachary in 741, Liutprand planned to campaign against the Lombard Duchy of Spoleto, which had defied him. Zachary, however, marched north to the Lombard capital of Pavia and convinced Liutprand to abort the expedition and to restore some of the territory he had captured. Nevertheless, Liutprand saw this treaty as between him and the Pope alone; in the words of Jeffrey Richards, &quot;he still regarded the exarch as fair game.&quot;

In 743, Liutprand marched on Ravenna, and Eutychius was so impoverished in resources that he, Archbishop John V of Ravenna, and the leading citizens petitioned the pope to intervene. Pope Zachary began a diplomatic offensive to dissuade Liutprand from conquering Ravenna, and on his journey to the Lombard court at Ticinum, he was met at the church of St. Christopher at Aquila by Exarch Eutychius and citizens of Ravenna. &quot;The sight of the exarch begging the pope to save him from the Lombards testifies more powerfully than anything else to the utter enfeeblement of the exarchate and the effective transfer of authority in Catholic Byzantine Italy from the imperial governor to the pope,&quot; observes Richards. Pope Zachary was successful in convincing Liutprand to put off his intended campaign and return the rural districts around Ravenna he had seized.

==Fall of the Exarchate==
Several years later, however, in 751, the Lombard king Aistulf captured Ravenna. The Exarchate came to an end, and Byzantine Italy was confined to Sicily and the southern, Greek-speaking regions.

<text>Bernice Morgan (born 1935) is a Canadian novelist and short-story writer. Much of her work portrays the history and daily life of Newfoundland. She is best known for her novel &quot;Random Passage&quot; which became a television mini-series on CBC.

==Early life==
Morgan was born in St. John&#x27;s, in pre-Confederation Newfoundland, to William Vardy of Random Island, Trinity Bay and Sadie (Vincent) Vardy of Cape Island, Bonavista Bay. Much of Morgan&#x27;s writing reflects life in these outport communities.

She attended the St. John&#x27;s Seventh-day Adventist Academy from Grade 1 to Grade 10. Morgan completed her last year of high school at MacPherson Academy, after which she took a Commercial Course at Bishop Spencer, where her formal education ended.

Morgan married George Morgan, also of St. John&#x27;s, in November 1956. The couple had three children: a son and two daughters.

==Career==
After leaving her Commercial Course, Morgan worked at a variety of office jobs as a cashier and clerk. During those years she continued to write, winning several Newfoundland &amp; Labrador Arts and Letters Awards and publishing in local newspapers and magazines and on CBC Radio. Morgan&#x27;s first writing job was at the Daily News where she published a weekly column titled &quot;Suburban Scrawl&quot; under the pseudonym Maggie Barrett. Subsequently, Morgan worked for many years in public relations, first with Memorial University of Newfoundland where she was editor of &quot;The Gazette&quot; and later with the Newfoundland Teachers&#x27; Association (NTA) where she edited &quot;The Bulletin&quot;.

Morgan, together with writers Helen Fogwell Porter and Geraldine Chafe Rubia, edited &quot;From This Place&quot; (Jesperson Press, 1977), a collection of the writing by 45 women of Newfoundland and Labrador. The project was funded by a Secretary of State Grant to mark International Women&#x27;s Year.

Literary magazines that have published Morgan&#x27;s short stories include &quot;Fiddlehead&quot;, &quot;The Pottersfield Portfolio&quot;, &quot;Grain&quot;, and &quot;Tickle Ace&quot;. Among the anthologies that have carried Morgan&#x27;s writing are, &quot;Digging Into the Hill&quot; (Writers Alliance of Newfoundland &amp; Labrador), &quot;Twelve Newfoundland Short Stories&quot; (eds. Janes and Cuff, Harry Cuff), &quot;The Breakwater Book of Contemporary Newfoundland Short Fiction&quot; (ed. Matthews, Breakwater) &quot;Dropped Threads 3: Beyond the Small Circle&quot; (ed. Anderson, Vintage Canada), and &quot;Signatures: Newfoundland Women Artists and Writers&quot;(ed. McGrath, Killick). School textbooks with Morgan&#x27;s short stories include &quot;Themes For All Times&quot;(Jesperson Press); &quot;Cultures&quot; (Harcourt Brace); and &quot;Openings&quot; and &quot;Stages&quot; (Breakwater Books).

In September 1986 Morgan resigned from the NTA to begin working on her first novel. &quot;Random Passage&quot;, published in 1992, depicts a fishing community in the 1800s in a fictional Newfoundland outport called Cape Random. The place name is a combination of her parents&#x27; birthplaces. The sequel, &quot;Waiting for Time&quot; (1994), carried the story of Cape Random forward into the Newfoundland Cod Moratorium of 1992. &quot;Waiting for Time&quot; was awarded the 1995 Thomas Head Raddall Award and the Canadian Author&#x27;s Association Award for Fiction (1992). It was republished in Ireland, and in translation in Quebec and Germany.

In 2002, the four-part TV mini-series &quot;Random Passage&quot;, produced by Barbara Doran, was aired in Canada by the Canadian Broadcasting Company and in Ireland. The screenplay, by St. John&#x27;s writer Des Walsh, was based on Morgan&#x27;s first two novels. The film site remained as a tourist attraction after the series ended.

Morgan&#x27;s third novel, &quot;Cloud of Bone&quot; (Knopf Canada, 2007), explores humanity&#x27;s capacity for genocidal violence. Moving from World War II, St. John&#x27;s to 1998 Rwanda and Yugoslavia, and then to a pre-European Newfoundland, &quot;Cloud of Bone&quot; examines the murder of the Beothuks through the eyes of a World War II sailor, Shawnadithit, and a British anthropologist. &quot;Cloud of Bone&quot; won the 2008 Newfoundland &amp; Labrador Book Award in Fiction and was shortlisted for the Thomas Head Raddall Award. The novel has been republished by Penguin Books.

In 2015 Morgan&#x27;s novella, &quot;The Dragon&#x27;s Song&quot;, was printed as a limited edition art book by Running the Goat Books and Broadsides and illustrated with woodblock engravings and lithographs by her daughter Jennifer Morgan. This novella follows the life of two Newfoundland Christian missionaries in pre World War II China. Her children&#x27;s book, &quot;Seasons Before the War&quot;, illustrated by Brita Granstrom, was published by the same press in 2018. Morgan has described this book as, &quot;the story of free-range children in prewar St. John&#x27;s.&quot; &quot;Seasons Before the War&quot; was one of four books shortlisted for the INDY Nonfiction Award in 2021.

In the summer of 2022 Perchance Theatre, based in Cupids, NL, mounted Morgan&#x27;s play &quot;Area of Uncertainty&quot; under the direction of Sarah Phillips. This play describes the effect of Amelia Earhart&#x27;s eleven-day stop-over on Trepassey, Newfoundland in 1928.

==Honours==

In 1996 Bernice Morgan was named Artist of the Year by the Newfoundland and Labrador Arts Council and in 1998 she was awarded an honorary degree by Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador. She is a Member of the Order of Canada and received the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Medal in 2003, and the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012. In 2020 the St. John&#x27;s YWCA presented her with their Woman of Distinction Award, and in December of that year, Morgan was inducted into the Newfoundland and Labrador Arts Council (ArtsNL) Hall of Honour.

<text>Nursery web spiders (Pisauridae) are a family of araneomorph spiders first described by Eugène Simon in 1890. Females of the family are known for building special nursery webs. When their eggs are about to hatch, a female spider builds a tent-like web, places her egg sac inside, and stands guard outside, hence the family&#x27;s common name. Like wolf spiders, however, nursery web spiders are roaming hunters that do not use webs for catching prey.

Species occur throughout the world except for extremely dry or cold environments, and are common just about everywhere. Many can walk on the surface of still bodies of water and may even dive beneath the surface temporarily to escape enemies. They can jump a distance of , but they have trouble climbing extremely smooth surfaces such as glass.

The name &quot;nursery web spider&quot; is especially given to the European species &quot;Pisaura mirabilis&quot;. Adult female specimens may reach up to 15 mm in length, excluding legs. The legs of the male are longer in relation to body size than those of the female.

The female spider sometimes attempts to eat the male after mating. The male, to reduce the risk of this, often presents the female with a gift such as a fly when approaching in the hope that this will satisfy her hunger. Sometimes, this gift is a fake present intended to fool the female. Males may wrap the fake gift in silk, to deceive the female to mate. Females can detect the fake gift and terminate mating, negating the male&#x27;s deception in not giving a real gift.

Nursery web spiders resemble wolf spiders (Lycosidae) except for some key differences. The posterior lateral eyes of wolf spiders are relatively far back and point sideways. In nursery web spiders, the posterior lateral eyes are closer to the posterior median eyes. Also, female nursery web spiders carry their egg sacs with their chelicerae instead of attaching them to their spinnerets as wolf spiders do.

On January 24, 1826, the college received its first charter, signed by Mississippi Governor David Holmes. In 1827, the name was changed from Hampstead Academy to Mississippi Academy at the request of the board of trustees. On December 18, 1830, having become a college, the name was changed to Mississippi College. It offered degrees in arts, sciences, and languages.

In 1831, Mississippi College became the first coeducational college in the United States to award a degree to a female student. That year it granted degrees to two women, Alice Robinson and Catherine Hall.

In the beginning, Mississippi College was not church-related. For a number of years, it was affiliated with the Methodist and Presbyterian churches. Since 1850, Mississippi College has been affiliated with the Mississippi Baptist Convention, and the board of trustees oversees the institution.

===Civil War and reconstruction===
Classes were not held during the Civil War, and the buildings deteriorated. Many students joined with faculty, a school trustee and townspeople to form the Mississippi College Rifles, a company of the 18th Mississippi Infantry Regiment during the war years or signed up with other units.

In the half-century after the war, the college enrollment and campus slowly recovered. The college president Walter Hillman helped refurbish the buildings by securing Northern financing prior to being offered the college presidency. The endowment fund was renewed, and the physical structures were renovated.

From 1911 through 1932, the construction of Provine Science Building, Lowrey Hall, Alumni Hall and Farr-Hall Hospital was completed. The college endowment grew to $500,000 and in 1922, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools approved accreditation for the college. Enrollment reached 400 students.

===World War II and later 20th century===

In 1942, Mississippi College acquired Hillman College. A new Nelson Hall administration building was erected in 1948, and new residence halls were built.
In 1943, MC was among 131 colleges and universities nationwide taking part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission. During the V-12 period, the Navy had exclusive use of Chrestman, Alumni Hall, and the cafeteria. During World War II, enrollment was between 550 and 600 students. After the war ended and veterans returned, enrollment increased. About 1,000 students were enrolled in 1950, and 1,581 students by fall 1956.

Mississippi College was one of the last private colleges in the country to drop its segregation policy, and did not do so until the 1969–70 school year.

From 1957 through 1968, the college built the B.C. Rogers Student Center, Hederman Science Building, Self Hall, and a pair of residence halls. Provine Chapel was restored. The School of Nursing began in 1969. MC purchased the former Jackson School of Law in 1975, leading to the Mississippi College School of Law. In 1975, the division of business became the School of Business. In 1977, the division of education became the School of Education. In 1982, the 12 remaining departments were grouped into the College of Arts and Sciences.

In May 1992, MC absorbed Clarke College after the smaller school was forced to close due to declining enrollments. Throughout the 1990s, the college renovated and expanded; work was carried out on the library, electronic media center, Cockroft Hall (for the School of Nursing), A.E. Wood Coliseum, the Law School building in downtown Jackson, the New Men&#x27;s Residence Hall, the New Women&#x27;s Residence Hall, Jennings Hall, and Latimer House (a Victorian house later used for alumni receptions).

===21st century===
From 2002 to 2015, the college&#x27;s enrollment grew from 3,227 to 5,152. The number includes a record of 618 freshmen.

The number of international students rose from nine to a record 505 students from more than two dozen nations in fall 2015.

The college added a physician assistant program in 2011. MC was the first institution in Mississippi to offer such a degree. MC now offers doctorates in educational leadership and professional counseling.

Mississippi College was granted an exception to Title IX in 2015, which allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students for religious reasons.

As part of a restructuring process for the school&#x27;s bicentennial in 2026, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Mississippi Christian University starting that academic year.

<text>University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) is the health sciences campus of the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) and is located in Jackson, Mississippi, United States. UMMC, also referred to as the Medical Center, is the state&#x27;s only academic medical center.

UMMC houses seven health science schools: Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, Health Related Professions, Graduate Studies in the Health Sciences, Population Health and Pharmacy. (The main School of Pharmacy is headquartered on the University of Mississippi (UM) campus in Oxford, Mississippi.) The 164-acre campus also includes University Hospital, Wiser Hospital for Women and Infants, Conerly Critical Care Hospital, Children&#x27;s of Mississippi (including the Blair E. Batson Tower and the Kathy and Joe Sanderson Tower), the state&#x27;s only children&#x27;s hospital, and Rowland Medical Library.

==History==
The University of Mississippi Medical Center opened in 1955, but its beginnings date to 1903 when a two-year medical school was established on the parent campus in Oxford. In that era, certificate graduates went out of state to complete their doctor of medicine degrees.

Finally, in 1950, the Mississippi Legislature enacted a law to create a four-year medical school associated with the University of Mississippi. On July 1, 1955, the state&#x27;s new Medical Center, then commonly referred to as UMC, opened in Jackson, initially as a four-year medical school with medical and graduate students, interns and residents. As it had in Oxford, the School of Medicine offered both medical and graduate degree programs. The campus included a teaching hospital and a library.

The Oxford campus&#x27; nursing department moved to the Medical Center in 1956 and was granted school status in 1958. The School of Health Related Professions (SHRP) was added in 1971 and began offering baccalaureate curricula in 1973. The School of Dentistry was authorized in 1973, and its first students were admitted in 1975. The graduate program was elevated to school status in 2001 and designated the School of Graduate Studies in the Health Sciences.

The parcel of land on which UMMC&#x27;s University Hospital sits was once the site of the Mississippi Insane Asylum, which moved its operations in 1935 to Whitfield, Miss., and became Mississippi State Hospital. The bodies of perhaps seven thousand patients have been found on campus in unmarked graves.

===Civil rights era===
At its opening in 1955, UMMC provided care to African-American patients, but the patient-care facilities were segregated by race, according to local laws in the South at the time. In 1963, civil rights leader Medgar Evers was rushed to UMMC after being shot at his home in Jackson, MS, but he died in the hospital emergency room. In 1964, UMMC became the primary medical provider for injured Freedom Riders.

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited federally funded institutions from discriminating. In 1965, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed a federal civil rights complaint against UMMC. Robert Q. Marston, MD, then medical dean and Medical Center director, developed a compliance strategy which included hiring the first black faculty member, and integrating the hospitals and clinics.

At about the same time, Dr. Blair E. Batson, chair of the Department of Pediatrics at UMMC, offered a position in the department&#x27;s residency education program to Dr. Aaron Shirley, an African-American physician who had attended medical school in Tennessee. Shirley became the first African-American learner at UMMC when he entered the residency program in 1965.

In 1966, Sammie Long became the first Black woman to attend the school. In 1972, James Oliver became the school&#x27;s first Black M.D.-degree recipient.

===Modern era===

In June 2023, the UMMC shut down its LGBT health clinic in response to legislative pressure.

== About ==
As the academic health sciences campus of the University of Mississippi, the Medical Center functions as a separately accredited, semi-autonomous unit responsible to the chancellor of the university and through him to the constitutional Board of Trustees of the State Institutions of Higher Learning (IHL). The University of Mississippi Medical Center is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award baccalaureate, master&#x27;s and doctorate degrees. The Medical Center is accredited by The Joint Commission.

The IHL Board of Trustees appoints the UM chancellor, who then recommends a candidate for UMMC&#x27;s vice chancellor for health affairs. The vice chancellor also serves as the dean of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. LouAnn Woodward, MD, was named March 1, 2015, to fill the vice chancellor position. She is responsible for the overall strategic direction of the Medical Center. She is the first woman and the 10th person to hold the post.

Enrollment in UMMC&#x27;s 35 degree programs is more than 3,000 students. Admission preference is given to Mississippi residents in an effort to supply professionals to meet the state&#x27;s health-care needs.

The Associated Student Body (ASB) is the student government association for UMMC. It serves as a mechanism to organize student extracurricular activities and to voice student concerns, ideas, and questions to the administration and community.

UMMC is the only hospital in the state designated as a Level 1 trauma center. Specialized hospital services include: an interventional MRI; the only Level 4 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the state; separate medical, surgical, cardiac, neuroscience and pediatric ICUs; a heart station for diagnosis and treatment of heart disease; a heart failure clinic; heart, kidney, liver, pancreas, cornea and bone marrow transplant programs; a comprehensive stroke unit; state-of-the-art radiological imaging systems; a sleep disorders laboratory; an in vitro fertilization program; and special pharmaceutical services.

A portion of land on the UMMC campus was once the site of the Mississippi Insane Asylum, which moved its operations in 1935 and became Mississippi State Hospital.

===Medical facilities===
UMMC has the only hospital in the state designated as a Level 1 trauma center, and the state&#x27;s only Level 4 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) located in the Wiser Hospital for Women and Infants. The Medical Center also has the only organ transplant (adult and pediatric) program and OB/GYN emergency room in Mississippi.

With a total of 1,003 beds, including Holmes County and Grenada locations, UMMC is the largest diagnostic, treatment and referral care system in the state. Based on the latest fiscal year (2013–14) statistics, inpatient admissions at the multiple locations totaled more than 33,000, with more than 487,000 hospital outpatient visits. The UMMC emergency rooms in Jackson had 70,000 visits, while Grenada had 18,324 and Holmes County had 6,657.

Hospitals include:
* University Hospital
* Wallace Conerly Critical Care Hospital
* Winfred L. Wiser Hospital for Women and Infants
* Children&#x27;s of Mississippi Hospital
* UMMC Holmes County
* UMMC Grenada

University Physicians (UP), the faculty group practice of the School of Medicine is the state&#x27;s largest medical group representing more than 125 specialties. This network of providers includes more than 1,000 health care specialists and subspecialists. UP providers see about 404,870 patients each year in 170 locations in 38 counties.

UMMC faculty and advanced practice providers see patients at several on- and off-site clinics.

Specialized clinics include:
* UP Pavilion – Jackson, Miss.
* UP Grants Ferry – Flowood, Miss.
* UP Lakeland Medicine Center – Jackson, Miss
* UP Northeast Jackson at Select Specialty Hospital – Jackson, Miss.
* Women&#x27;s Specialty Care at Mirror Lake – Flowood, Miss.
* The Face &amp; Skin Center of University Physicians – Ridgeland, Miss.
* UMMC Cancer Institute at Jackson Medical Mall – Jackson, Miss.
* UP Clinics at Jackson Medical Mall – Jackson, Miss.

Other features and facilities include separate medical, surgical, cardiac, neuroscience and pediatric ICUs; University Heart for the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease; a heart failure clinic; a comprehensive stroke center; epilepsy center, state-of-the-art radiological imaging systems; a sleep disorders laboratory; an in vitro fertilization program; and special pharmaceutical services.

In 2007, professional football standout Eli Manning undertook a five-year campaign to improve UMMC&#x27;s pediatric clinics. More than $2.9 million was raised, and the clinics were renamed Eli Manning Children&#x27;s Clinics. In 2014, father Archie Manning and his family joined with UMMC to launch the Manning Family Fund for a Healthier Mississippi. The donor-supported program boosts the Medical Center&#x27;s commitment to improving Mississippians&#x27; health. The partnership between the Mannings and UMMC raises money to attack heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, cancer, dementia and other health challenges confronting Mississippians.

UMMC outreach programs help fulfill the Medical Center&#x27;s mission of improving the overall health of Mississippians. Efforts range from volunteer and pastoral services at UMMC to statewide emergency medical responses and state-sponsored outreach initiatives.

===Center for Telehealth===
In 2003, UMMC helped start a pilot program to connect emergency physicians in Jackson with three rural hospitals using telecommunications. The program has now grown into the Center for Telehealth, which ranks among the top programs in the nation.

Telehealth, also known as telemedicine, uses remote technologies to provide services ranging from diabetes counseling to remote monitoring of intensive care patients. UMMC&#x27;s telehealth program functions as a virtual clinic performing direct medical diagnostics and treatment from physicians, specialists and nurses. It averages 8,000 consultations a month.

In 2015, UMMC and data company Venyu Solutions (acquired by EATEL in 2013) partnered to expand the Medical Center&#x27;s telehealth services.

The 40,000 square foot UMMC Center for Telehealth Venyu Technology Campus is being constructed by Duvall Decker Architects, in Jackson, Mississippi, and is recognized by an AIA Mississippi Award Citation.

===Affiliated entities===
Separate entities are affiliated with UMMC because of services they provide in support of the Medical Center. They include:
* Children&#x27;s Miracle Network
* UMMC Alliance
* University Transplant Guild

===Aircare Flight Service===
The University of Mississippi Medical Center&#x27;s Helicopter Flight program began operations in 1996 with a single helicopter based in Jackson. The Jackson-based AirCare 1 helicopter was joined by the Meridian-based AirCare 2 helicopter in spring 2009, the Golden Triangle-based AirCare 3 in spring 2016, and Greenwood-based Aircare 4 in 2017. The additional helicopters allowed AirCare to expand its mission profile by transporting patients to not only UMMC, but other hospitals able to provide levels of care required by the patient&#x27;s illness or injury. Scene response profile has also changed, allowing the transportation of multiple patients from a single location. Since the program&#x27;s inception, AirCare teams have safely transported over 18,000 adults, pediatric and neonatal patients over 2 million miles without any FAA-reportable accidents as of 2016.

===Economic impact===
With more than 10,000 full- and part-time employees, UMMC is one of the largest employers in Mississippi. Its annual budget – approximately one-tenth from state appropriations – represents 10 percent of the Jackson metro area economy and 2 percent of the state economy.

On any given weekday, about 20,000 employees, students, patients, family members, vendors and other guests are present on the UMMC campus.

<doc id="289785" wikidata="Q657778" url="?curid=289785" title="Prince William of Gloucester">
<text>Prince William of Gloucester (William Henry Andrew Frederick; 18 December 1941 – 28 August 1972) was a member of the British royal family. The elder son of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, he was a grandson of George V, nephew of Edward VIII and George VI, and first cousin of Elizabeth II. At birth he was fourth in line to the throne; he was ninth in line at the time of his death.

A Cambridge and Stanford graduate, he joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office serving in Lagos and Tokyo, before returning to take over royal duties. He led an active life, flying Piper aircraft, trekking through the Sahara, and hot air ballooning.

He was the most recent descendant of George III to be diagnosed with porphyria, probably hereditary, which is conjectured to be the illness that caused George III&#x27;s mental breakdown.

Prince William died in 1972, aged 30, in an air crash while piloting his plane in a competition.

==Early life==

Prince William was born at Hadley Common, Hertfordshire. His father was Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, the third son of King George V and Queen Mary. His mother was Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, the third daughter of the 7th Duke of Buccleuch and Lady Margaret Bridgeman.

He was baptised in the Private Chapel at Windsor Castle on 22 February 1942 by Cosmo Gordon Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury. His godparents were King George VI (his paternal uncle), Queen Mary (his paternal grandmother), Princess Helena Victoria (his paternal first cousin twice-removed), Lady Margaret Hawkins (his maternal aunt), Major Lord William Montagu Douglas Scott (his maternal uncle) and Lord Gort, who was unable to attend. Because of the war, newspapers did not identify the actual location of the christening, and said instead that it took place at &quot;a private chapel in the country&quot;.

At the time of his birth, and for months afterwards, Prince Henry was away on military duties, some of which meant considerable risk. This prompted George VI to write to his sister-in-law, promising that, if anything should happen to his brother, he would become Prince William&#x27;s guardian.

In 1947, Prince William was a page boy for his cousin Princess Elizabeth at her wedding to Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The other page boy was Prince Michael of Kent. In 1953, he attended the coronation of Elizabeth II.

Prince William spent his early childhood at Barnwell Manor in Northamptonshire and later in Canberra, Australia, where his father served as Governor-General from 1945 to 1947. After returning to England, he received his education at Wellesley House School, a prep school at Broadstairs in Kent, then at Eton College, where he achieved mention in the &quot;Eton College Chronicle&quot; for his performance in junior cricket and achieved house colours for football. After leaving Eton in 1960, he went up to Magdalene College, Cambridge, to read history, graduating with a BA degree in 1963, subsequently raised to an MA (Cantab.) degree in 1968. After Cambridge, he spent a post-baccalaureate year at Stanford University, studying political science, American history, and business.

==Career==
After returning to Britain, Prince William took a position with Lazards, a merchant bank.

He was the second member of the British royal family to work in the civil service or the diplomatic service (the first was his uncle, Prince George, Duke of Kent, in the 1920s). He joined the Commonwealth Office in 1965 and was posted to Lagos as the third secretary at the British High Commission. In 1968, he transferred to Tokyo as second secretary (commercial) in the British Embassy.

By 1970, the health of his father, the Duke of Gloucester, had become critical after further strokes. William had no choice but to resign from the diplomatic service and return to Britain in order to take care of his father&#x27;s estate and, as he put it, take on the full-time job of a royal prince. On his way back, he represented the Queen at the celebrations to mark the termination of Tonga&#x27;s status as a protected state. For the next two years, he managed Barnwell Manor and began to carry out public duties as a member of the royal family.

Apart from taking over many engagements his father could no longer perform, William took particular interest in St John Ambulance, where he became increasingly active. He was also President of National Ski Federation Supporters&#x27; Association, the Magdalene Society (Cambridge), the East Midlands Tourist Board, and the Royal African Society. His patronages included the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain, the British Schools Exploring Society and the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society.

Prince William served on some occasions as Counsellor of State in the absence of his cousin, the Queen.

==Personal life==
The prince was consistently described by friends as adventurous (almost to the point of recklessness), warm, tender and extremely generous. But of all his qualities, the one most often mentioned is that of loyalty to his friends. One account describes how William was particularly kind to friends who were either &quot;ill, unpopular with others, or even downright embarrassing&quot;. His status and circumstances had also influenced his personality and he could, at times, be &quot;tiresomely selfish&quot;.

Regarding his family, Prince William considered himself extremely lucky compared to other members of the royal family. He had a very close relationship with both his parents, especially with his mother of whom he said, &quot;She is a human being and she must possess some faults. But so far as I am concerned she has no faults at all&quot;. He was also very fond of his father, one friend describing William&#x27;s love and tenderness for him as &quot;infectious&quot;. William acknowledged his father couldn&#x27;t have been very happy as a young man, as a result of the strict upbringing he had received, so he was very grateful to him for the freedom he had given him throughout his life.

Former Hungarian model and stewardess Zsuzsi Starkloff (1936–2020, born Zsuzsana Maria Lehel in a Jewish-Hungarian family) had a long-running relationship with Prince William. They first met in 1968 in Japan, where Starkloff worked and divorced from American pilot Edward Starkloff. The last time Prince William and Zsuzsi met in person was in August 1970. The relationship with Starkloff was further explored in the 2015 Channel 4 TV documentary, &quot;The Other Prince William&quot;. Despite the alleged reluctance of senior members of the royal family to take William&#x27;s relationship with Starkloff seriously, the standards regarding marriage in the royal family at the time were no longer as strict as they had been. Princess Margaret, while not encouraging William, did sympathize with him in this regard, telling him to &quot;wait a bit&quot; and to &quot;see how everything looks&quot; once he returned to Britain. Furthermore, once back in England, Starkloff went to stay with William&#x27;s family at Barnwell Manor, where his parents were kind and accommodating to her. William&#x27;s intentions regarding his relationship with Starkloff are unclear. In the year of his death, he gave an interview to Audrey Whiting for the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, in which he declared that if he ever married, he would do so to a woman not only right for him, but right in &quot;the eyes of other members of the Family&quot;.

In the early 1970s, Prince William began a relationship with divorcee Nicole Sieff (&quot;née&quot; Moschietto), daughter of a Monte Carlo restaurateur, who had two sons from her marriage to Jonathan Sieff, grandson of Israel Sieff, Baron Sieff.

===Health===
Shortly before transferring to Tokyo in August 1968, Prince William was examined by a Royal Air Force doctor, Headly Bellringer, at the request of the prince&#x27;s mother. William told the doctor that he had suffered from jaundice, beginning in December 1965 and lasting several months. He had subsequently noticed that his skin was prone to a blistering rash, particularly on exposure to sunshine. Bellringer tentatively diagnosed porphyria, prescribed sunblock cream and gave him a medical warning card regarding the need to avoid certain medications. Although he was aware of the theory of the royal family&#x27;s history of porphyria then being proposed by Ida Macalpine and Richard Hunter, he stated he &quot;tried not to let it influence him...with all the symptoms, I was left with little option but to diagnose the Prince&#x27;s condition as porphyria.&quot; William was later examined by haematologists at Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital in Cambridge, and also by a Professor Ishihara in Tokyo, both of whom also concluded he was suffering from variegate porphyria, by then in remission.

A member of the British royal family being reliably diagnosed with porphyria added credence to the theory—first proposed by Professor Macalpine in the late 1960s—that porphyria was the source of the ill-health of both Mary, Queen of Scots (an ancestor of both of William&#x27;s parents), and of George III, and that the disorder had been inherited by some members of the royal families of the UK, Prussia and several German duchies and principalities.

==Death==
A licensed pilot and President of the British Light Aviation Centre, Prince William owned several aircraft and competed in amateur air show races. On 28 August 1972, he was competing in the Goodyear International Air Trophy at Halfpenny Green near Wolverhampton. Vyrell Mitchell—a pilot with whom the prince had often raced—was listed as a passenger. Shortly after takeoff and while at a very low altitude, the Piper Cherokee banked abruptly to port; there was an extreme increase in the rate of turn and a corresponding loss of altitude. The wing of the plane hit a tree shearing off and the out-of-control plane flipped over and crashed into an earthen bank, bursting into flames. Prince William and Mitchell were killed. The crash happened before 30,000 spectators, the fire took two hours to control, and the bodies were identified at inquest the next day from dental records.

His father, Prince Henry, was in such poor health at the time of his death that his mother hesitated whether to tell him. She later admitted in her memoirs that she did not, but that he may have learned of their son&#x27;s death from television coverage.

Prince William was buried in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore. The comprehensive school in Oundle, which he opened in 1971, was renamed Prince William School in his memory. His will was sealed in London after his death in 1972. His estate was valued at £416,001 (or £3.9 million in 2022 when adjusted for inflation).

William was the heir apparent of his father&#x27;s peerages, Duke of Gloucester, Earl of Ulster, and Baron Culloden. Upon his death, his younger brother Prince Richard of Gloucester became heir apparent, and succeeded to these peerages in 1974. William was the first grandchild of King George V and Queen Mary to die.

<doc id="289786" wikidata="Q147651" url="?curid=289786" title="Peanut butter">
<text>Peanut butter is a food paste or spread made from ground, dry-roasted peanuts. It commonly contains additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture, such as salt, sweeteners, or emulsifiers. Consumed in many countries, it is the most commonly used of the nut butters, a group that also includes cashew butter and almond butter.

Peanut butter is a nutrient-rich food containing high levels of protein, several vitamins, and dietary minerals. It is typically served as a spread on bread, toast, or crackers and used to make sandwiches (notably the peanut butter and jelly sandwich). It is also used in a number of breakfast dishes and desserts, such as granola, smoothies, crepes, cookies, brownies, or croissants.

== History ==
The earliest references to peanut butter can be traced to Aztec and Inca civilizations, who ground roasted peanuts into a paste. However, several people can be credited with the invention of modern peanut butter and the processes involved in making it. The U.S. National Peanut Board credits three modern inventors with the earliest patents related to the production of modern peanut butter. Marcellus Gilmore Edson of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, obtained the first patent for a method of producing peanut butter from roasted peanuts using heated surfaces in 1884. Edson&#x27;s cooled product had &quot;a consistency like that of butter, lard, or ointment&quot; according to his patent application which described a process of milling roasted peanuts until the peanuts reached &quot;a fluid or semi-fluid state&quot;. He mixed sugar into the paste to harden its consistency.

A businessman from St. Louis named George Bayle produced and sold peanut butter in the form of a snack food in 1894. By 1917, American consumers used peanut products during periods of meat rationing, with government promotions of &quot;meatless Mondays&quot; when peanut butter was a favored choice.

John Harvey Kellogg, known for his line of prepared breakfast cereals, was an advocate of using plant foods as a healthier dietary choice than meat. He was issued a patent for a &quot;Process of Producing Alimentary Products&quot; on May 24, 1898, and used peanuts, although he boiled the peanuts rather than roasting them. Kellogg&#x27;s Western Health Reform Institute served peanut butter to patients because they needed a food that contained a large amount of protein that could be eaten without chewing. At first, peanut butter was a food for wealthy people, as it became popular initially as a product served at expensive health care institutes.

Although often credited with its invention, George Washington Carver did not invent peanut butter. By the time Carver published his document about peanuts, entitled &quot;How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it For Human Consumption&quot; in 1916, many methods of preparation of peanut butter had already been developed or patented by various pharmacists, doctors, and food scientists working in the US and Canada.

Early peanut-butter-making machines were developed by Joseph Lambert, who had worked at Kellogg&#x27;s Battle Creek Sanitarium, and Dr. Ambrose Straub who obtained a patent for a peanut-butter-making machine in 1903.

In 1922, chemist Joseph L. Rosefield invented a process for making smooth peanut butter that kept the oil from separating by using partially hydrogenated oil; Rosefield licensed his invention to the company that created Peter Pan peanut butter in 1928. In 1932 he began producing his own peanut butter under the name Skippy. Under the Skippy brand, Rosefield developed a new method of churning creamy peanut butter, giving it a smoother consistency. He also mixed fragments of peanuts into peanut butter, creating the first &quot;chunky&quot;-style peanut butter. In 1955, Procter &amp; Gamble launched a peanut butter named Jif, which was sweeter than other brands due to the use of sugar and molasses in its recipe.

In South Africa, the first peanut butter was produced in 1926 by Alderton Limited in Potgietersrus (now Mokopane), The product proved so popular that Tiger Brands (then Tiger Oats Company) took over the manufacture under the brand name Black Cat, which it still produces.

A related dish named ( in Sranan Tongo) existed in Suriname by 1783. This was more solid than modern peanut butter and could be cut and served in slices like cheese. , a soup-like peanut-based dish, also existed in Suriname around that time. Peanut butter is referred to as () in Dutch for this reason, as Suriname was a Dutch colony at that time. When peanut butter was brought onto the market in the Netherlands in 1948, it was not allowed to do so under the name &quot;peanut butter&quot;. The word &quot;butter&quot; was specifically reserved for real butter, to avoid confusion with margarine.

== Name ==
Similar to nut milks, nut butters and peanut butter are related to an equivalent dairy product that people are familiar with. Butter is a dairy product usually made from cow&#x27;s milk and processed into a solid that can be spread on food. Although peanut butter is not solid at normal room temperatures, it is thick and spreadable.

A slang term for peanut butter in World War II was &quot;monkey butter&quot;.

== Types ==
Among the types of peanut butter are
* &quot;conventional&quot; peanut butter, which consists of up to 10% salt, sugars, and hydrogenated vegetable oil
* &quot;crunchy&quot; or &quot;chunky&quot; peanut butter, which includes coarsely-ground peanut fragments to give extra texture
* &quot;smooth&quot; peanut butter, in which the peanuts are ground uniformly, possibly with the addition of corn syrup and vegetable oil, to create a thick, creamy texture like butter
* &quot;natural&quot; peanut butter, which normally contains only peanuts and salt and is sold without emulsifiers that bind the peanut oils with the peanut paste, and so requires stirring to recombine the ingredients before consumption
* &quot;organic&quot; and &quot;artisanal&quot; peanut butter, whose markets are small; artisanal peanut butter is usually preservative-free, additive-free, and handmade in a cottage industry-style setup used first around 1970.

== Production process ==

=== Planting and harvesting ===
Due to weather conditions, peanuts are usually planted in spring. The peanut comes from a yellow flower that bends over and penetrates the soil after blooming and wilting, and the peanut starts to grow in the soil. Peanuts are harvested from late August to October, while the weather is clear. This weather allows for dry soil so that when picked, the soil does not stick to the stems and pods. The peanuts are then removed from vines and transported to a peanut shelling machine for mechanical drying. After cropping, the peanuts are delivered to warehouses for cleaning, where they are stored unshelled in silos.

=== Shelling ===
Shelling must be conducted carefully lest the seeds be damaged during the shell removal. The moisture of the unshelled peanuts is controlled to avoid excessive frangibility of the shells and kernels, reducing the dust in the plant. Afterwards, the peanuts are sent to a series of rollers set specifically for the batch of peanuts, where they are cracked. After cracking, the peanuts go through a screening process where they are inspected for contaminants.

=== Roasting ===
The dry roasting process employs either the batch or continuous method. In the batch method, peanuts are heated in large quantities in a revolving oven at about . Next, the peanuts in each batch are uniformly held and roasted in the oven at for about 40 to 60 minutes. This method is good to use when the peanuts differ in moisture content. A hot air roaster is employed in the continuous method. The peanuts pass through the roaster while being rocked to permit even roasting. A photometer indicates the completion of dry roasting. Large manufacturers favor this method since it can lower the rate of spoilage and requires less labor.

=== Cooling ===
After dry roasting, peanuts are removed from the oven as quickly as possible and directly placed in a blower-cooler cylinder. There are suction fans in the metal cylinder that can pull a large volume of air through, so the peanuts can be cooled more efficiently. The peanuts will not be dried out because cooling retains some oil and moisture. The cooling process is completed when the temperature in the cylinder reaches .

=== Blanching ===
After the kernels have been cooled down, the peanuts will undergo either heat blanching or water blanching to remove the remaining seed coats. Compared to heat blanching, water blanching is a new process. Water blanching first appeared in 1949.

==== Heat blanching ====
Peanuts are heated by hot air at for not more than 20 minutes in order to soften and split the skins. After that, the peanuts are exposed to continuous steam in a blanching machine. The skins are then removed using either bristles or soft rubber belts. After that, these skins are separated and blown into waste bags. Meanwhile, the hearts of peanuts are segregated through inspection.

==== Water blanching ====
After the kernels are arranged in troughs, the skin of the kernel is cracked on opposite sides by rolling it through sharp, stationary blades. While the skins are removed, the kernels are brought through a one-minute hot water bath and placed on a swinging pad with canvas on top. The swinging action of the pad rubs off the skins. Afterward, the blanched kernels are dried for at least six hours by hot air at .

After blanching, the peanuts are screened and inspected to eliminate the burnt and rotten peanuts. A blower is also used to remove light peanuts and discolored peanuts are removed using a color sorting machine.

=== Grinding ===
After blanching the peanuts are sent to grinding to be manufactured into peanut butter. The peanuts are then sent through two sizes of grinders. The first grinder produces a medium grind, and the second produces a fine grind. At this point, salt, sugar, and vegetable oil stabilizer may be added to the fine grind; this adds flavor and allows the peanut butter to stay as a homogeneous mixture. Chopped peanuts may also be added at this stage to produce &quot;chunky&quot; peanut butter.

=== Packaging ===
Before packaging, the peanut butter must be cooled to be sealed in jars. The mixture is pumped into a heat exchanger in order to cool it to about . Once cool, the peanut butter is pumped into jars and vacuum-sealed, a process which removes air and deoxygenates the peanut butter to inhibit its oxidation. The jars are then labeled and set aside until crystallization occurs. The peanut butter jars are then packaged into cartons and distributed to retailers, where they are stored at room temperature and sold to consumers.

A 2012 article stated that China and India are the first and second-largest producers of peanuts. The United States is the third-largest producer of peanuts. Georgia and Texas are the two major peanut-producing states, and more than half of the American peanut crop is used to make peanut butter.

== Consumption ==
The United States is a leading exporter of peanut butter and one of the largest consumers of peanut butter annually per capita. January 24 is National Peanut Butter Day in the United States. In March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, retail sales of peanut butter in the United States increased by 75% over the level in March 2019.

According to Jon Krampner&#x27;s 2013 book on peanut butter, per capita consumption of peanut butter in Canada and the Netherlands the largest consumer per capita in Europe exceeds that of the United States.

In Israel, the peanut-butter-flavored puffcorn snack Bamba accounts for 25% of the snack market; its consumption by infants has been linked to a low incidence of peanut allergies among Israelis.

In a 100 gram amount, smooth peanut butter supplies 597 calories and is composed of 51% fat, 22% protein, 22% carbohydrates (including 5% dietary fiber), and 1% water (table). Both crunchy and smooth peanut butter are sources of saturated and monounsaturated fats (mainly oleic acid) as 25% of total serving amount, and polyunsaturated fat (12% of total), primarily as linoleic acid).

Peanut butter is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of dietary fiber, vitamin E, pantothenic acid, folate, niacin, and vitamin B6 (table, USDA FoodData Central). Also high in content are the dietary minerals manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, and sodium (added as salt during manufacturing). Peanut butter is a moderate source (10–19% DV) of thiamin, riboflavin, iron, and potassium (table).

=== Peanut allergy ===
For people with a peanut allergy, peanut butter can cause a variety of possible allergic reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis. This potential effect has led to banning peanut butter, among other common foods, in some schools.

Symptoms include:
* Shortness of breath
* Wheezing
* Tightening of the throat
* Itching
* Skin reactions such as hives and swelling
* Digestive problems

== Uses ==

=== As an ingredient ===
Peanut butter is included as an ingredient in many recipes: peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, peanut butter cookies, and candies where peanut is the main flavor, such as Reese&#x27;s Pieces, or various peanut butter and chocolate treats, such as Reese&#x27;s Peanut Butter Cups and the Crispy Crunch candy bar.

Peanut butter&#x27;s flavor combines well with other flavors, such as oatmeal, cheese, cured meats, savory sauces, and various breads and crackers. The creamy or crunchy, fatty, salty taste pairs very well with complementary soft and sweet ingredients like fruit preserves, bananas, apples, and honey. The taste can also be enhanced by similarly salty things like bacon.

One snack for children is called &quot;ants on a log&quot;, with a celery stick acting as the &quot;log&quot;. The groove in the celery stick is filled with peanut butter and raisins arranged in a row along the top are &quot;ants&quot;.

Plumpy&#x27;nut is a peanut butter-based food used to fight malnutrition in famine-stricken countries. A single pack contains 500 calories, can be stored unrefrigerated for two years, and requires no cooking or preparation.

=== As animal food ===
Peanut butter inside a hollow chew toy is a method to occupy a dog with a flavored treat. A common outdoor bird feeder is a coating of peanut butter on a pine cone with an overlying layer of bird seed.

==Physical properties==

Peanut butter is a viscoelastic food that exhibits both solid and fluid behaviors. It consists of ground-up peanuts and may contain additional additives, such as stabilizers, sugars, or salt. Its characteristic soft, spreadable texture can be further defined through rheology the study of flow and deformation of matter, affecting texture, consistency, and mouthfeel. Specifically for peanut butter, rheology can be used to define characteristics, such as spreadability and grittiness more accurately.

<doc id="289795" wikidata="Q746427" url="?curid=289795" title="Roux">
<text>Roux () is a mixture of flour and fat cooked together and used to thicken sauces. Roux is typically made from equal parts of flour and fat by weight. The flour is added to the melted fat or oil on the stove top, blended until smooth, and cooked to the desired level of brownness. A roux can be white, blond (darker), or brown. Butter, bacon drippings, or lard are commonly used fats. Roux is used as a thickening agent for gravy, sauces, soups, and stews. It provides the base for a dish, and other ingredients are added after the roux is complete.

== Ingredients ==
The fat is most often butter in French cuisine, but may be lard or vegetable oil in other cuisines. Roux is used in three of the five mother sauces of classic French cooking: béchamel sauce, velouté sauce, and espagnole sauce. 

Roux may be made with any edible fat. For meat gravies, fat rendered from meat is often used. In regional American cuisine, bacon is sometimes rendered to produce fat to use in the roux. If clarified butter is not available, vegetable oil is often used when producing dark roux, since it does not burn at high temperatures, as whole butter would.

Instead of butter, in Cajun cuisine roux is made with lard, oil, or drippings from meat, poultry, or bacon. It is often cooked to a medium or dark brown color, which lends considerable richness of flavor while making it thinner.

Central European cuisine often uses rendered lard or, more recently, vegetable oil instead of butter for the preparation of roux.

Japanese curry is made from a roux made by frying yellow curry powder and flour together with butter or oil; this is called .

Roux (&quot;meyane&quot;) has been used in Ottoman and Turkish cuisine since at least the 15th century.

== Methods ==

The fat is heated in a pot or pan, melting it if necessary. Then the flour is added. The mixture is heated and stirred until the flour is incorporated, and then cooked until at least the point where a raw flour taste is no longer apparent and the desired colour has been reached. The final colour can range from nearly white to nearly black, depending on the length of time it is heated and its intended use. The result is a thickening and flavoring agent.

== Types ==
Light (or &quot;white&quot;) roux provides little flavor other than a characteristic richness to a dish, and is used in French cooking and some gravies or pastries throughout the world.

Darker roux is made by browning the flour in oil for a longer time and adds a distinct nutty flavor to a dish. They may be called &quot;blond,&quot; &quot;peanut-butter,&quot; &quot;brown,&quot; or &quot;chocolate&quot; roux depending on their color. The darker the color, the richer the flavor.

Swabian (southwest German) cooking uses a darker roux for its &quot;brown broth&quot; (), which, in its simplest form, consists of nothing more than lard, flour, and water, with a bay leaf and salt for seasoning. Dark roux is often made with vegetable oils, which have a higher smoke point than butter, and are used in Cajun and Creole cuisine for gumbos and stews. The darker the roux, the less thickening power it has; a chocolate roux has about one-fourth the thickening power, by weight, of a white roux. A very dark roux, just shy of burning and turning black, has a distinctly reddish color and is sometimes referred to as &quot;brick&quot; roux.

In Hungary, roux &quot;(rántás)&quot; is almost always made with paprika and is the basis of several dishes, including főzelék (vegetable stew) and soups. It may also be prepared with onions and garlic.

=== Cretan staka ===

Staka () is a type of roux particular to Cretan cuisine. It is prepared by cooking sheep&#x27;s milk cream over a low flame with wheat flour or starch: the protein-rich part of the butterfat coagulates with the flour or starch and forms the &quot;staka&quot; proper, which is served hot. It is generally eaten by dipping bread in it, occasionally served over French fries.

The fatty part separates to form &quot;stakovoutyro&quot;, staka butter, which is kept for later use and has a faint cheesy flavor. Staka butter is used in Cretan pilaf (&quot;piláfi&quot;), commonly served at weddings.

<text>Heather Renee French Henry (born December 29, 1974) is an American fashion designer, politician, veterans advocate and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss America 2000. She is married to former Kentucky Lieutenant Governor Steve Henry.

==Biography==
Raised in Augusta, Kentucky, Heather French Henry graduated from the University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning. She competed in pageants through her teens, including the Miss Ohio pageant. The vocalist competed in the Miss Kentucky Pageant four times before winning the state title on her fifth attempt in 1999. In September 1999, Heather won the Miss America pageant, the first Miss Kentucky to do so. She was the second native of Kentucky to win the Miss America title after Venus Ramey won in 1944, competing as Miss District of Columbia. Heather spent the year as Miss America 2000 promoting the scholarship pageant program and advocated her cause of support of American veterans.

Heather&#x27;s platform for her reign was raising awareness of homeless veterans; her father was a wounded veteran of the Vietnam War. She received numerous awards for her work with veterans, including Kentuckian of the Year by &quot;Kentucky Monthly&quot;.

On October 27, 2000, Heather married Kentucky Lieutenant Governor Steve Henry, 21 years her senior, in Louisville. The wedding led to controversy over state resources being expended as part of the wedding and planning. The Henrys repaid the state $3,200 for services related to their wedding rendered to them by state employees. The couple have two daughters, Harper Renee (born 2001) and Taylor Augusta (born 2003).
In October 2003, French Henry struck and subsequently killed Karola Stede, 44, a native of Germany and mother of four who was crossing against the traffic light in a Louisville intersection. French said that the accident deeply affected her, and she subsequently recounted her story in venues such as &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;.

In November 2007, she was named to Kentucky Governor-elect Steve Beshear&#x27;s transition team. On July 1, 2014, Beshear appointed Henry Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Veterans Affairs. She was replaced by Governor Matt Bevin with retired Brigadier General Norman E. Arflack on March 15, 2016, with French Henry subsequently being appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Veterans Affairs.

French Henry was the 2019 Democratic nominee for Secretary of State of Kentucky. She lost the general election to Michael Adams.

<doc id="289799" wikidata="Q167440" url="?curid=289799" title="Legio IV Macedonica">
<text>Legio IV Macedonica (&quot;Macedonian Fourth Legion&quot;), was a legion of the Imperial Roman army founded in 48 BC by Gaius Julius Caesar (dictator of Rome 49–44 BC) with Italian legionaries. The legion was disbanded in AD 70 by Emperor Vespasian. The legion symbols were a bull (as with all of Caesar&#x27;s legions) and a capricorn.
== History ==

=== Early history ===
This legion was possibly founded in Italy during the 48 BCE Julius Caesar, who needed it in his war against Pompey. It saw its first action at the Battle of Dyrrhachium. After the civil war the legion was stationed in Macedonia. It was supposed to serve in Caesar&#x27;s campaign against the Parthian Empire. However, the expedition was canceled after Caesar&#x27;s death. This legion would go onto fight in the civil war between Antony and Augustus. Before the conflict erupted, the legion was moved to Italy by Mark Antony, although this did not deter them from siding with Augustus during the Battle of Mutina, where they fought against Antony and suffered heavy losses. In 42 BC, the legion fought at the Battle of Philippi and returned to the Italy with Augustus. It was nearly destroyed at the Battle of Phillipi, however it survived to be rebuilt. Likely resulting in the name &quot;Macedonica&quot;. They were subsequently present at the siege of Perugia in the winter of 41 BC, where Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony&#x27;s brother, had taken refuge. The legion was also present at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC.

=== Cantabrian Wars ===
After Augustus became Emperor, in 30 BC it was moved to Juliobriga in Hyspania Tarraconensis to fight the Cantabrian Wars. After the war the soldiers continued to serve as civil servants in Hispania. 

=== Early service in Germania ===
Emperor Claudius likely transferred the legion to Mainz in Germania Superior to replace the XIV Gemina. Probably in 41 AD.However. Some people think that the legion was transferred in 39 AD, when emperor Caligula waged war against the Germanic Chatti. While stationed in Germania the Fourth shared the fortress with the recently founded XXII Primigenia. The younger unit occupied the less honorable left-hand side, whereas IV Macedonica was living in the right-hand side.

=== Year of Four Emperors ===
During the Year of Four Emperors the Fourth legion were among the first to side with Vitellius. Soldiers of this took part in Vitellius&#x27; march to Italy. It conquered the road through Switzerland, fought at Cremona and Bedriacum against the troops of the emperor Otho. Several of its soldiers were rewarded for their service. Later they were defeated by Vespasian.

=== Later service in Germania ===
Meanwhile, in Germania Inferior, the Batavians revolted. During the revolt the IV Macedonica guarded Mainz against attacks by Germanic Chatti, Usipetes and Mattiaci. Although it had been successful during the campaign, it was regarded with some suspicion by the new emperor. Because of this it was punished, reconstituted under a new name, IV Flavia Felix, and given a new symbol, the lion. The lion was related to Hercules, Vespasian&#x27;s favorite deity.

=== After Germania ===
The new Legio IV Macedonica was moved to Burnum, a Roman military camp in Dalmatia. It would remain there until 70 CE. In the year 85 CE, the legion was transferred to Singudunum, Moesia. The legion would also be transferred to Syria by general Corbulo. During the reign of Domitian, it fought against the Alemmani and Dacians. Later it fought in Trajan&#x27;s Dacian Wars. The Legio IV Macedonica would remain in Singudunum for the next 200 years. Afterwards it disappears from history.

<text>Legio XII Fulminata (&quot;Thunderbolt Twelfth Legion&quot;), also known as &quot;Paterna&quot;, &quot;Victrix&quot;, &quot;Antiqua&quot;, &quot;Certa Constans&quot;, and &quot;Galliena&quot;, was a legion of the Imperial Roman army. It was originally levied by Julius Caesar in 58 BC, and the legion accompanied him during the Gallic Wars until 49 BC. The unit was still guarding the Euphrates River crossing near Melitene at the beginning of the 5th century.

The legion&#x27;s emblem was a thunderbolt (on a shield &quot;fulmen&quot;). In later centuries it came to be called commonly, but incorrectly, the &quot;Legio Fulminatrix&quot;, the Thundering Legion.

==History==
===Under the Republic===

The Twelfth legion, as it is perhaps better known, fought in the Battle against the Nervians, and probably also in the Siege of Alesia. The Twelfth fought at the Battle of Pharsalus (48 BC), when Caesar defeated Pompey. After Caesar won the civil war, the legion was named &quot;Victrix&quot;, and enlisted in 43 BC by Lepidus and Mark Antony. Mark Antony led the Twelfth, renamed &quot;XII Antiqua&quot; during his campaign against the Parthian Empire.

During the latest part of Augustus&#x27; principality, XII &quot;Fulminata&quot; served in Syria, camping at Raphana.

===Under the Empire===

====Against the Parthians====

From his eastern Parthian Empire in present-day Iran and Iraq, King Vologeses I in 58 AD invaded Armenia, a client kingdom of Rome. Emperor Nero ordered Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, the new Legate of Cappadocia, to manage the matter. Corbulo ordered Legion IV &quot;Scythica&quot; from Moesia, and along with the III &quot;Gallica&quot; and VI &quot;Ferrata&quot; defeated the Parthians, restoring Tigranes VI to the Armenian throne. In 62 AD, the XII &quot;Fulminata&quot; joined the IV &quot;Scythica&quot;, now commanded by the new Legate of Cappadocia, Lucius Caesennius Paetus. Both legions were defeated by the Parthians and Armenians at the battle of Rhandeia; after surrendering, the legions were shamed and removed from this theater of war.

====First Jewish–Roman War====

In 66, after a Zealot revolt had destroyed the Roman garrison in Jerusalem, the XII &quot;Fulminata&quot;, with &quot;vexillationes&quot; of IV &quot;Scythica&quot; and VI &quot;Ferrata&quot;, were sent to restore Roman authority. After Cestius Gallus&#x27; withdrawal from the siege of the Temple Mount, XII &quot;Fulminata&quot; was ambushed and defeated by Eleazar ben Simon in the Battle of Beth Horon, losing its &quot;aquila&quot;. However, XII &quot;Fulminata&quot; fought well in the last part of the war, and supported its commander T. Flavius Vespasian in his successful bid for the imperial throne. At the end of the war, XII &quot;Fulminata&quot; and XVI &quot;Flavia Firma&quot; were sent to guard the Euphrates border, camping at Melitene.

====Defending the Eastern frontier====


In 75 AD, the XII &quot;Fulminata&quot; was in the Caucasus, where Emperor Vespasian had sent the legion to support the allied kingdoms of Iberia and Albania. An inscription presumably from this period has been found in modern-day Azerbaijan which reads:

Some historians argue that the settlement of Ramana near Baku was possibly founded by the Roman troops of Lucius Julius Maximus from Legio XII Fulminata in circa 84-96 AD and derives its name from the Latin &quot;Romana&quot;. Facts that strengthen this hypothesis include: a military-topographical map of the Caucasus published in 1903 by Russian administrators, which refers to the town as &quot;Romana&quot;; various Roman artifacts found in Absheron region; and records that old(er) inhabitants referred to their town as &quot;Romani&quot;.
The legion was probably in Armenia during Trajan&#x27;s campaign of 114 AD, that ended with the annexation of the Kingdom of Armenia.

In 134, the threat of the Alans was subdued by the governor of Cappadocia, Arrian, who defeated the invaders with the aid of XII &quot;Fulminata&quot; and XV &quot;Apollinaris&quot;.

The Twelfth probably fought in the Parthian campaign of Emperor Lucius Verus, in 162–166, if a mixed unit of XII and XV controlled for some time the newly conquered Armenian capital Artaxata. Emperor Marcus Aurelius commanded the XII &quot;Fulminata&quot; in his campaign against the Quadi, a people inhabiting an area in modern-day Slovakia, and an episode of a miraculous rain and lightning saving a Twelfth subunit from defeat is reported by the sources. At this time, most of the Twelfth was composed chiefly of Christians. There was a belief that this had led to the emperor issuing a decree forbidding the persecution of the Christians, but this seems to have been based on a forgery.

In 175, the legion was in Melitene, when Avidius Cassius revolted; the Twelfth, having been loyal to the Emperor, obtained the cognomen &quot;Certa Constans&quot;, &quot;surely constant&quot;.

After the death of Emperor Pertinax, 193, XII &quot;Fulminata&quot; supported the governor of Syria, Pescennius Niger, who was in the end defeated by Emperor Septimius Severus. When the Eastern frontier of the Empire was moved from the Euphrates to the Tigris, the Twelfth stayed in the reserve, possibly as a punishment for its support of Severus&#x27; rival.

The region around Melitene was one of the first in which Christian faith spread. Polyeuctes is a martyr under Valerian who was a soldier of the Twelfth.

The Sassanid Empire was a major threat to the Roman power in the East. King Shapur I conquered the base of the XV &quot;Apollinaris&quot;, Satala (256), and sacked Trapezus (258). Emperor Valerian moved against Shapur, but was defeated and captured. The defeat caused the partial collapse of the Empire, with the secessionistic Gallic Empire in the West and Palmyrene Empire in the East. It is known that the XII &quot;Fulminata&quot; was under the command of Odaenathus, ruler of the Palmyrene Empire, but also that Emperor Gallienus awarded the legion with the cognomen &quot;Galliena&quot;.

After these episodes, the records of the &quot;Fulminata&quot; are scarce. The Palmyrene Empire was reconquered by Aurelian; Emperor Diocletian defeated the Sassanids and moved the frontier to Northern Mesopotamia. The Twelfth, which probably took part to these campaigns, is recorded guarding the frontier of the Euphrates in Melitene, at the beginning of the 5th century (&quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;).

==In popular culture==
In Rick Riordan&#x27;s book &quot;The Son of Neptune&quot;, the Twelfth Legion went to America after the fall of Rome, following the Roman gods, and set up Camp Jupiter in California as a base for Roman demigods.

In Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s book &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, Pontius Pilate mentions the Legion during his meeting with Caiaphas. He threatens using the Legion in bloody pacification of possible future Jewish rebellion, along with auxiliary Arab cavalry.

The fiction book &quot;Rome: The Eagle of the Twelfth&quot; by M.C. Scott is based on the legion during the Jewish rebellion.

<text>Samson Kitur (February 25, 1966 — April 25, 2003) was a Kenyan athlete, and an Olympic medalist in 1992.

==Biography==
Unlike most of his compatriots, who run in distances 800 metres and up, Kitur specialised in the 400 metres. He won the continental championship in 1991, and the next year he took the bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics, behind winner Quincy Watts. A year later, another bronze medal was his at the World Championships in Stuttgart.

He died suddenly of an unspecified illness at age 37 in his home in Eldoret, his home Kerotet Village near Ziwa.

Two of his brothers were also Olympic athletes: Simon Kitur and David Kitur.

<text>Martin de Hoyarçabal (Martin Oihartzabal in modern spelling) was a French Basque mariner. Little is generally known about his life. He was born in Ciboure, in the Iparralde, the French Basque Country. He is recognized for publishing one of the first Newfoundland pilots, a book which describes places and distances to aid sailors in navigation, in 1579. &quot;Les voyages aventureux du Capitaine Martin de Hoyarsabal, habitant du çubiburu&quot; was published in French and was widely used by French and Spanish mariners for almost a century.

==Hoyarçabal&#x27;s &quot;Navigational Pilot&quot;==
The &quot;Pilot&quot; is the only known extant work by Hoyarçabal. As a reference work, the &quot;Navigational Pilot&quot; was invaluable for ships traveling in the Newfoundland area. The following is an example taken from Hoyarçabal&#x27;s work; in this text, Hoyarçabal is giving distances between several places in Newfoundland:
*With Cape S. Marie &amp; Plaisence lying north northeast &amp; south southeast, go 9 leagues. Further, you should know that when you will go from Cape S. Marie, along this route of north northwest, you will find a long point which is named Amigaiz, from which to Plaisence go 4 leagues, &amp; from Cape S. Marie 5 leagues, after which you will have passed the aforementioned Amigaiz, you will find Plaisence.

In 1677, Pierre Detcheverry translated and expanded the &quot;Navigational Pilot&quot; into Labourdin Basque. The following is the corresponding passage, demonstrating the looseness of the translation into Basque:
*&quot;Anyway, you have to know when you go that route that you will [see?] a point which is called point Mehea and from there to Placença, 5 leagues from there and from point Mehea to the cape, 4 leagues because you pass point Mehea soon Placença will be in the bay at the starboard side&quot;.

<text>Janice Dales &quot;aka&quot; Kim Morrissey is a Canadian poet and playwright who lives in London, England. Many of her works examine the role of women in nineteenth century culture, re-imagining the lives of historical figures. She is also part of the Comedy Collective UK (which included Colin Shelbourn, John Random, Ivan Shakespeare, Lee Barnett, Claire Storey, Jasmine Birtles, Robert Priest). The working drafts of Morrissey&#x27;s play &quot;Mrs Ruskin&quot;, about Effie Gray, have been published on the web. She has written for various radio dramas and documentaries, as well as the 1980s political satire radio show Week Ending.

Morissey&#x27;s &quot;Poems for Men who Dream of Lolita&quot; purport to be written by Lolita herself, reflecting on the events in the story, a sort of diary in poetry form. Morrissey portrays Lolita as an innocent, wounded soul. In speaking of her work in &quot;Lolita Unclothed,&quot; a documentary by Camille Paglia, she has complained that in the novel Lolita has &quot;no voice&quot;. The poems were set to music at the New Music Festival in Winnipeg in 1993 (composer: Sid Rabinovitch). Five poems from the book were selected for &quot;Mythic Women/Real Women&quot; (edited by Lizbeth Goodman), Faber &amp; Faber&#x27;s Women &amp; Gender university textbook. Morrisey also dealt with the theme of ephebophilia in her stage play about Sigmund Freud&#x27;s Dora case.

<doc id="289818" wikidata="Q7173980" url="?curid=289818" title="Peter Finch (poet)">
<text>Peter Finch (born 1947) is a Welsh author, psychogeographer and poet living in Cardiff, Wales.

== Early life ==
Finch was born in Cardiff, Wales, in March 1947, son of Stanley and Marjorie Finch, a post office worker and a telephonist. He attended school in the city and took up his first job as a trainee local government accountant at Glamorgan County Council in 1963.

He began reading and writing poetry after hearing a recording of Allen Ginsberg reading &quot;Howl&quot; and then buying a copy of the City Lights Edition of this work at Cardiff&#x27;s SPCK (Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge) Bookshop in the Friary. His early work appeared in small magazines such as &quot;Poet&#x27;s Platform, Breakthru&quot; and &quot;Viewpoints&quot;. In 1964 he heard Howlin&#x27; Wolf and other performers at the American Negro Blues Festival at Colston Hall, Bristol. There he met the bass player and performer Willie Dixon and tried to interest him in his home grown south Wales blues lyrics. He failed.

== &quot;Second Aeon&quot; ==
In 1966 he founded the literary magazine, &quot;Second Aeon&quot; which ran for 21 issues until 1974. The magazine grew in both content and stature to become the leading alternative lit magazine of the day. Peter Barry called it &quot;The most prominent and best established avant-garde poetry magazine of the period&quot;. The magazine generated its own publication series which ran to 80 titles and included works by Peter Redgrove, Kent Taylor, Geraint Jarman, William Wantling, Bob Cobbing, Doug Blazek, D M Thomas and John Tripp. In 1968 Finch founded &quot;No Walls&quot;, a weekly poetry reading series which ran until 1970. Eighteen issues of the reading series&#x27; magazine &quot;The No Walls Broadsheet&quot; were published. In 1976 at the height of the Poetry Wars he was offered the editorship of the London Poetry Society&#x27;s &quot;The Poetry Review&quot;, a post he did not accept.

== 1970s and experimental poetry ==
During the 1970s with &quot;Second Aeon&quot; magazine at its height Finch became deeply involved with experimental, concrete, sound and visual poetry. He&#x27;d met Bob Cobbing in London and had been drawn to the innovative often anarchic styles practised in the capital. He became treasurer of the Association of Little Presses (ALP), the Welsh representative of Poet&#x27;s Conference, the poets trade union, and a council member of the Poetry Society in Earl&#x27;s Court.

In Wales he had been elected a member of the English Section of Yr Academi Gymreig, the Welsh Academy, the august association of writers, and was regarded by some as its an enfant terrible.

His work, often in the form of extended sound poetry innovations, was performed at venues throughout the UK. His visual poetry was exhibited in the company of that of Peter Mayer, dsh, Cobbing and others both in the UK and further afield. He was awarded a Welsh Arts Council bursary for visual poetry. The University of California exhibited both his concrete poetry and &quot;Second Aeon&quot; magazine artefacts.

Richard Kostelanetz called him &quot;the principal innovator in Welsh poetry... Finch has favored a variety of tight sober structures, including parodies of other poets, visual poems, sound poems, and verbal imitations of Philip Glass&#x27; music... Finch deserves a Welsh knighthood&quot;.

== The Oriel bookshop – 1973–1998 ==
Following his appointment in 1973 Finch managed the Welsh Arts Council&#x27;s Oriel bookshop, a specialist bilingual (English and Welsh) arts and poetry retailer for twenty-five years. This included the original first floor operation in Charles Street, Cardiff until 1989, the more commercial shop on the ground floor at The Friary until 1997 and, briefly, as manager of the HMSO Oriel take-over until 1998. The shop became a centre for writers, small publishers, innovators, poets and performers. It was a home to Welsh-language culture in the capital as well as a venue for numerous poetry readings and other literary events. Everyone from R. S. Thomas to Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Jackson Mac Low to Simon Armitage and Margaret Atwood to Derek Walcott read at the premises. The ALP mounted bookfairs. Writers groups gathered.

== How to get published ==
Informed by his experience as a magazine editor, a performing and published poet and then a bookseller Finch wrote and published a number of highly successful guides. His &quot;Getting Your Poetry Published&quot;, first brought out by the Association of Little Presses in 1973, ran to 15 editions with many thousands of copies in print. His &quot;How to Publish Your Poetry&quot; (Allison &amp; Busby, 1985), &quot;How to Publish Yourself&quot; (Allison &amp; Busby, 1987) and &quot;The Poetry Business&quot; (Seren, 1994) all ran to multiple editions. Between 1989 and 2007 he compiled the poetry section for Macmillan&#x27;s trade guidebook &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Handbook&quot;. Between 1990 and 2018 he compiled the self publishing section for A&amp;C Black&#x27;s &quot;Artists&#x27; and Writers&#x27; Yearbook&quot;.

== 1980s and performance poetry ==
During the 1980s, and with a background in sonic innovation and the stretching of the poetry voice, Finch was at the forefront of the emerging performance poetry scene. Following on from the founding work of poet Chris Torrance he joined Cabaret 246 and then, with poets Topher Mills and Ifor Thomas, the trio Horses Mouth. The work here involved innovative use of props and owed as much to theatre as it did to traditional literary performance. The need to entertain became a driver.

== Academi and Literature Wales ==
In 1998 he left the Oriel Bookshop to head Academi, the new Welsh National Literature Promotion Agency and Society of Writers developed from the old Welsh Academy (Yr Academi Gymreig) and funded by the Welsh Government. This organisation had the job of promoting and developing literature throughout the country. Finch considerably expanded bursary provision, visits of writers to schools, prisons, and deprived communities, literary tours, readings, festivals and other provisions. At the Wales Millennium Centre he created the Glyn Jones Centre. This was a writer&#x27;s library and drop-in advice centre developed with a legacy from the great Anglo-Welsh writer. He put the annual Wales Book of the Year prize onto a visible and celebratory footing; created the role of Welsh National Poet; and helped smooth the way for innovations such as the poet Gwyneth Lewis&#x27; bilingual words built across the frontage of the Wales Millennium Centre. In 2001 he guest edited a Welsh edition of the US magazine &quot;Slope&quot; which provided a bi-lingual snapshot of just what was happening in poetry in Wales at the turn of the Millennium.

== Later life and work ==
In the new millennium Finch worked on psychogeographies and alternative guides to his native city of Cardiff. His first book of this genre, &quot;Real Cardiff&quot;, which appeared in 2002 was successful enough to generate three follow ups and a whole series of &quot;Real&quot; books covering mainly urban areas throughout the UK. These are written by a range of authors (including Grahame Davies and Patrick McGuinness). There are 25 in the series to date. Finch acts as series editor. Finch has also written on popular music (&quot;The Roots of Rock&quot; – 2016), the Severn Estuary (&quot;Edging the Estuary&quot; – 2013) and has produced innovative walking guides to both Cardiff and its valleys with the photographer John Briggs.

In 2022 with the assistance of editor Andrew Taylor he published two volumes comprising 1,000 pages of his Collected Poems. These books have been well received. He has recently published a new chapbook of 14 poems, &quot;Just When You Think It&#x27;s Over – It Starts Again&quot; with the small DIY, punk, handmade publisher in New Jersey, Between Shadows Press.

== Work in the public realm ==
Finch has four pieces associated with public artworks on show in the built environment of Cardiff. These include &quot;Ysbwriel&quot; (2002) as part of Jeroen Van Western&#x27;s &quot;Breathing In Time Out&quot; across the top of the Lamby Way landfill site; sections of &quot;R S Thomas Information&quot; (2003) which have been incorporated onto the exterior and interior of the BT Internet Data Centre in Cardiff Bay; &quot;L&#x27;Alliance&quot; (2010) as part of Jean-Bernard Metais public artwork in The Hayes, Cardiff; and &quot;The Ballast Bank&quot; (2011) as part of Renn &amp; Thacker&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Light&quot; outside Butetown Police Station in Cardiff Bay.

<text>The Paso Fino is a naturally gaited light horse breed dating back to horses imported to the Caribbean from Spain. &quot;Pasos&quot; are prized for their smooth, natural, four-beat, lateral ambling gait; they are used in many disciplines, but are especially popular for trail riding. In the United States two main groups of horses are popularly called &quot;Paso Fino&quot;: One, also known as the Paso Fino Puro Puertorriqueño, originated in Puerto Rico. The other, often called the Colombian Paso Fino or Colombian Criollo Horse, developed in Colombia. Though from similar Spanish ancestors, the two groups developed independently of one another in their home nations.

==History==
The Paso Fino name means &#x27;fine step&#x27;. The Paso Fino is a blend of the Barb, Spanish Jennet, and Andalusian horse and was bred by Spanish land owners in Puerto Rico and Colombia to be used in the plantations because of their endurance and comfortable ride. All Pasos share their heritage with the Peruvian Paso, the American Mustangs, and other descendants of Colonial Spanish Horses. Puerto Rican and Colombian horses, as well as Paso Finos from Cuba and other tropical countries, have been interbred frequently in the United States to produce the modern American Paso Fino show horse.

On the second voyage of Christopher Columbus from Spain to the Americas in 1493, he disembarked with his soldiers, 20 horses and 5 mares on the island of Borinquen at the bay of Aguada (today Añasco), and gave the region the name San Juan Bautista. Soon after, in May 1509, the first governor of the island, Juan Ponce de León, brought horses to Puerto Rico from his hacienda, El Higuey, located on the neighboring island of La Española (now Hispaniola).

===Puerto Rican Paso Fino===

The Puerto Rican Paso Fino was developed on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico over a 500-year colonial period. Island geography and the desires of a people for hardy, sure-footed, comfortable horses led to the independent development of the breed. Frenchman Andres Pedro Ledru, in a notation about horse races held on 17 July 1797, wrote that the speed of these horses was admirable, &quot;they have no trot or gallop, but a type of pace (&quot;Andadura&quot;). A gait so precipitated that the eye can&#x27;t follow the movement of the legs.&quot; As early as 1849, Paso Fino competitions were held in Puerto Rico, with prizes for winners, for the purpose of improving local horses. In 1882 the first racetrack was built, and in every race meet, there were Paso Fino and Andadura categories.

According to genetic research, Puerto Rican Paso Fino originated from the local Criollo (non-purerbred) horses that were a product of many years of admixture between different Iberian breeds originally brought to the island by the Spanish settlers. These horses carried with them a mutant &quot;gait-keeper&quot; allele that first increased in the Puerto Rican Criollo population as they were bred for centuries for the smooth ride long before the Paso Fino breed was established on the island. In fact, the Criollo horses in Puerto Rico still carry a genomic signature of selection around the &quot;gait-keeper&quot; locus today. Consequently, the Paso Finos, where the mutation is present at 100%, must have originated as a local breed from the population of local non-purebred horses on this island, where they were later selected for other characteristics to improve gait and appearance.

According to Ramirez de Arellano, when the United States invaded Puerto Rico in 1898, the Paso Fino played a first-order role in transportation as well as agricultural work. Manchado, a notable horse of the time owned by Don Nicolás Quiñones Cabezudo of Caguas, was said to be &quot;so fine that it gaited at liberty without its rider in the town square when asked.&quot;

In 1927 the most influential sire in the modern Puerto Rican Paso Fino breed, Dulce Sueño, was born in Guayama. In 1943, the Federation of the Sport of Paso Fino Horses of Puerto Rico and a breed registry were established. Copita Don Q, a Dulce Sueño grandson, was the winner of the first annual Federation contest in 1943. In an agricultural almanac published in 1947, Gustavo A Ramirez de Arellano wrote, &quot;at present the descendants of the famous stallion &#x27;Dulce Sueño&#x27; are the ones who have most obtained titles and trophies from the association of owners of saddle horses.&quot;

===Colombian Paso===

===Importation and development in the United States===
The rise of the Paso Fino in the United States began in the 1950s and 1960s. The first Paso Finos in the United States were imported by members of the armed services, who purchased the horses while stationed in Puerto Rico. This stock provided some of the first Paso Finos bred in the United States.

Colombian Pasos came to the United States beginning with a rancher who visited Colombia and purchased quite a number of the horses to work his cattle. He introduced the second strain into the US. While the two strains are still bred individually to retain their purity, they are also crossbred to produce the best of both strains.

Today, the Paso Fino Horse Association (PFHA) oversees and regulates registered Paso Finos in the US. It was founded in 1972 under the name &quot;American Paso Finos&quot;, later changing to its current name. It registers and promotes both Puerto Rican and Colombian horses, and under the PFHA, the two groups have been frequently crossbred. As the numbers of Colombian horses have begun to significantly outnumber those of Puerto Rican bloodlines, a trend has developed favoring preservation breeding to preserve the bloodlines of each group.

The American &quot;Trote &amp; Trocha&quot; Association formed to promote the horses, primarily of Colombian breeding, that perform a diagonal ambling gait known as the &quot;Trocha&quot;. The Trocha differs from the classic lateral ambling gait of the Paso Fino.

==Characteristics==

The Paso Fino tends to be refined, standing an average of but is powerful for its size. It has a convex head, clean legs and a relatively short back with prominent withers. Cannon bones tend to be short and the hooves are hard. The Paso Fino often has a thick mane and tail. It is found in all horse colors and there are no restrictions by the various breed associations. The Puerto Rican Paso Fino is the only breed in which tiger eye was found, which usually lightens the eyes to a striking amber, yellow, or bright orange color.

The action of the two strains is somewhat different. The Puerto Rican Paso Fino is prized for its fine or delicate step, while the Colombian Paso Fino tends to have more of a rapid, piston-like action.

This is a lively horse that has a natural drive and willingness, known colloquially as &quot;&quot;brio&quot;,&quot; and generally an amiable disposition. Paso Finos come in a variety of colors, sizes and body types, but the even four-beat gait and brio are present in all good representatives of the breed. 
===Gaits===

The Paso Fino executes a natural evenly spaced four-beat lateral ambling gait, similar to many gaited horses. Both the Colombian and the Puerto Rican strains of the Paso Fino execute the lateral gait naturally, without the aid of training devices.

The Paso Fino&#x27;s gaits are performed at varied levels of extension in stride. All four hooves travel close to the ground while in motion and are lifted equally in height as the horse covers ground. At whatever speed the horse travels, the smoothness of the gait ideally allows the rider to appear motionless with little up and down movement.

* The &quot;classic fino&quot; or &quot;paso fino&quot; is a collected gait with rapid footfalls that covers as little ground as possible. It requires a high degree of collection. This is a show gait reserved for competition. Walking, trotting, cantering or any detected break from the rapid evenly spaced sequence of steps is grounds for disqualification at any time during a fino event.
* The &quot;paso corto&quot; is slightly more extended, and used during trail rides. The speed of this gait is comparable to the speed of a trot but is much smoother.
* The &quot;paso largo&quot; is a fast, lateral, four-beat gait in which the horse can reach speeds equivalent to a canter or slow gallop. The paso largo is not just an increase in speed but also shows a distinct extension in stride. The paso largo can be extremely fast, up to 25-30 mph.

Only a few Paso Finos can perform a true classic fino, but the majority perform the other gaits with ease. The correctness of the gait is very important by today&#x27;s standards, therefore horses with a very even four-beat gait are much preferred for professional breeding.

In Colombia, some related native horses perform a slightly different, unevenly timed diagonal four-beat gait, known as the &quot;trocha,&quot; which is similar to the fox trot, and very smooth. While some Paso Finos will perform the trocha, it is discouraged and considered a fault in the purebred Paso Fino. In Colombia the &quot;trocha&quot; has evolved, becoming a separate genealogical line. It is inherited in a manner similar to the lateral ambling gaits of the purebred Paso Fino. Trocha rivals in popularity with paso fino in Colombia, but crossbreeding is now avoided. Another Colombian breed performs what is known as &quot;trote y galope.&quot; The trote y galope horses perform an exaggerated diagonal two-beat trot and a very collected canter, but they do share some common heritage with the Paso Fino. Not as well known as Paso Fino, these variants are just beginning to be recognized in the United States.

==Uses==
Paso Finos are versatile and are used in many disciplines. They have horse shows for the breed only, but are also seen competing in all-breed disciplines such as trail riding and endurance competition, driving and gymkhana.

<doc id="289825" wikidata="Q192393" url="?curid=289825" title="Évry, Essonne">
<text>Évry () is a former commune in the southern suburbs of Paris, France, prefecture of the department of Essonne. On 1 January 2019, it was merged into the new commune Évry-Courcouronnes.

It is located from the center of Paris, in the &quot;new town&quot; of Évry Ville Nouvelle, created in the 1960s, of which it is the central and most populated commune.

Significant nearby communes include Courcouronnes, Corbeil-Essonnes, Ris-Orangis, Brétigny-sur-Orge, and Draveil.

==Name==
Originally the commune was called &quot;Évry-sur-Seine&quot; (meaning &quot;Évry upon Seine&quot;). The name &quot;Évry&quot; comes from the Gallic name &quot;Eburacon&quot; or &quot;Eburiacos&quot;, meaning &quot;land of Eburos&quot; (a Gallic patronym), perhaps the leader of a Gallic tribe in the area before the conquest of Gaul by the Romans. After the conquest, the name was corrupted into Latin &quot;Apriacum&quot;, then Medieval Latin &quot;Avriacum&quot;, and later &quot;Evriacum&quot;.

In 1881 the name of the commune was changed into &quot;Évry-Petit-Bourg&quot; at the request of entrepreneur Paul Decauville, owner of &quot;Ateliers de Petit-Bourg&quot;, a large boiler works located in Évry and at the time the largest employer in the area. The factory owed its name to the hamlet of Petit-Bourg (one of the three hamlets on the territory of Évry) where it was built.

On 29 June 1965 the name of the &quot;commune&quot; was shortened into &quot;Évry&quot; only. Évry had just been chosen to become a &quot;new town&quot; of the suburbs of Paris, destined to host tens of thousands of suburbanites, and so the name &quot;Petit-Bourg&quot; (literally meaning &quot;little borough, small town&quot; in modern French, although etymologists think that this name was in fact the corruption of an old Gallic word with a totally different meaning) was deemed too old fashioned and improper for the new large suburban city of Évry to be built.

==History==

In 1965 Évry became part of the French new town initiative and took its current name. Before then it was known as &quot;Évry-Petit-Bourg&quot; and had a population of only a few thousand.

When Évry was built, Orly was the primary international airport of France, and many international companies, such as Digital, Hewlett-Packard, and Alstom, established their head offices in Évry. However, with the expansion of Charles de Gaulle Roissy airport, all the larger companies have moved out, causing the downfall of the many smaller service companies which catered to the lunchtime needs of the thousands of staff who were either displaced or made redundant.

The town has tried to counteract this exodus by increasing the capacity of the commercial center, the Agora, to 235 shops, mostly selling the same wares (54 ready-made women&#x27;s wear, 14 shoe shops, 28 men&#x27;s wear, 13 children&#x27;s wear, 15 jewellers, 9 mobile phone shops, 9 opticians, and 19 restaurants and snack bars). The economy of the Agora has also been hit by the recession. A total of 29 shops and one restaurant are vacant. 24 are on the upper level where the rents are almost double that of the lower level shops. During the week the car parks are now &quot;pay by the hour&quot; to discourage rail commuters from saturating the parking space during the day to the detriment of shoppers. Weekend parking is free.

Another measure taken by the local authorities has been to declare certain quarters a &quot;zone franche&quot; which means that businesses starting up in these areas are exempt from corporation tax along with many other social benefits and aids which makes Évry an attractive town for future entrepreneurs.

The Cathedral of the Resurrection, dedicated to Saint Corbinien, is one of the few 20th-century cathedrals built in a truly modern style (see also Coventry Cathedral Basil Spence 1962, Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral Frederick Gibberd 1967). The total cost was 13.72M€. The total surface is 1,600 m2, and it is 34 m high. It can receive 1,400 people. Pope John Paul II made a visit on 22 August 1997, and although car parks were requisitioned as far away as Corbeil-Essonnes, apart from invited guests, fewer than 500 people turned out for the event, which means that Évry may hold the world record for the smallest crowd at a papal appearance.

In 2003, the Socialist mayor, Manuel Valls (born 13 August 1962, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, French nationality by naturalisation in 1982), and who is also the constituency deputé (Member of Parliament) and a qualified &quot;avocat&quot; (barrister), embarked upon a massive safeguard plan designed to entirely renovate the more defavourised areas which includes much demolition of the obsolete 1960s buildings (especially in the &quot;Pyramides&quot; quarter, once the French equivalent of the Gorbals), and the upgrading of the more recent residential structures and schools. 2006 saw the final renovation of the &quot;Collège des Pyramides&quot; at the cost of 11.43M€ (the price of a new school) and will receive 571 pupils. In 2007, enlargement and renovation was to begin on the Lycée des Loges. The work was to last three years without interruption of lessons, and the budget was set at 40M€. Demolition of several buildings in the Jules Vallès quarter of the Pyramides is in progress. They will be replaced by &quot;low level&quot; blocks of appartements. At the same time, the university residence is being renovated along with the construction of a &quot;mall&quot; which will eventually link the northern limit of the town with the town centre in preparation for when the tramway will provide a direct transport to Paris as an alternative to the RER railway.

On 31 January 2006, in the Sénat during the 14th ceremony of the &quot;Prix du Trombinoscope 2005&quot; (press awards), Manuel Valls was elected &quot;Local Representative of the Year&quot;. With the heavy defeat of the Socialists on the national scale during the 2007 elections, Manuel Valls has taken a prominent position in the party and has been given the nickname of &quot;Le Sarko de la gauche&quot; (the left wing Sarkozy).

During the 2008 municipal elections, Manuel Valls was returned to office as mayor on the first round with 70.3% of the vote, which gave him the highest national score for a first-round ballot, making Evry the safest Socialist commune in France. During his first national presentation as a presidential candidate during the Socialist primary elections of 9 October 2011, Manuel Valls won 5.63% of the vote.

The 3 June 2012 saw an exceptional reunion of the town council where Manuel Valls resigned as mayor after being nominated as Minister of the Interior in the new Socialist government. Amongst the personalities present were Jacques Guyard, former mayor, Jean-Pierre Caffet, senator, and Lionel Jospin, former prime minister. The first adjoint, Francis Chouat, became the new mayor. The place of first adjoint is now held by Pacôme Adjourouvi who was born and grew up in the defavourised Pyramides sector and is now an &quot;avocat&quot; at the tribunal of Evry.

==Demographics==
Évry is demographically the second youngest town in France, with the average age of the population only 26 years. (Recently beaten by Mulhouse with an average age of 24 years.) On 9 September 2011, 7,000 children began a new academic year in the town&#x27;s 42 schools with eight supplementary classes added. Over 3,300 meals are served daily in the school canteens, and the town has spent €10 million on education. Not including teaching staff, 350 auxiliaries are employed looking after the 3- to 11-year-old children, along with seven staff specialised in sport.

At the other end of the age span, Évry has only three residences for the elderly, and the cemetery, proportionally small compared to towns with similar a population figure, is closed to further inhumations. Burials are now carried out at the Garenne cemetery in nearby Courcouronnes where a crematorium has also recently been built.

Five paediatricians are established in Évry along with paediatric units in the hospital and in the two private clinics, whereas no funeral parlours or morticians exist in the town of Évry.

==Administration==

Évry is the &quot;préfecture&quot; (capital) of the Essonne &quot;département&quot;. It is also the official seat of the arrondissement of Évry, although in reality the &quot;sous-préfecture&quot; buildings and administration are located in the neighboring commune of Corbeil-Essonnes.

Évry is the seat of the canton of Évry-Courcouronnes, which consists of the commune of Évry-Courcouronnes.

==Transport==
The regional rapid transit RER line D forks just south of Évry into two branches, encircling Évry and the commune of Ris-Orangis before merging into one right-of-way again north of the fork. Évry is served by three stations along the two branches: , , and . The line that serves the station &quot;Évry-Courcouronnes&quot; and &quot;Le Bras-de-Fer&quot; was built at the same time as the new town.

The town is bordered to the west by the A6 motorway, south by the National 104, and the National 7 running north to south divides the town in two. The Seine marks the eastern limit of the town. A new port has recently been built to accommodate an increase in barge traffic.

The local bus network is served by Tice operator, including lines 401, 402, 403 and 453, 404, 405, 407, 408, 414, 414D and 415. By night, Noctilien can be taken from Evry to Villeneuve-Saint-Georges station with line N135 and to Paris-Est station with line N144. Both stations are also deserved by the RER.

There is also a very strong presence of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in Évry, with a new Kingdom Hall on the Route Nationale 7 nearly opposite the pagoda.

The Grand Mosque of Évry with its 5,525 m2 is one of the largest in Europe, and is of Moroccan architecture. The minaret is 25 m tall. It has a large prayer room and can accommodate a total of 5.000 people. The construction of the mosque was mostly funded by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and the interior decoration by the Moroccan king Hassan II. The total cost was €6.8 million. Although the true story of the kidnapping and death of Ben Barka is still a mystery, many people believe he is buried either under the mosque or in the nearby forest of La Garenne.

The Khanh-Anh Pagoda completed in 2015 is the largest Buddhist temple in Europe (3,287 m2) and can accommodate 1,500 people. The initial cost was estimated at €7.6 million, mostly funded by the Vietnamese community, but is expected to have doubled by the end of the construction. Work began in 1996 and is yet to be completed. The statue of Buddha, 4 metres tall and weighing 5 tons, arrived from Thailand on 20 October 2002. The pagoda will be the headquarters of the European Buddhist Congregation and will be a training school for future monks and nuns. The Dalai Lama consecrated the edifice on 12 August 2008. He made a speech in English which was translated by interpreters into French and Vietnamese. 1,500 adepts were admitted into the grounds coming from as far away as Canada, but only 500 visitors watched the ceremony on a giant screen erected in the nearby park.

==Parks and recreation==
Parc-du-Lac Courcouronnes is a relatively large park with a walking trail and a small lake, located in Evry-Courcouronnes. It is home to the famous &quot;Dame du Lac&quot;, a very large climbing wall constructed by architect Pierre Skelezy in 1975.

==Miscellaneous==
The composer Gioachino Rossini had a country residence in Évry to be near his friend Edmond de Goncourt, who lived on the opposite bank of the Seine in Draveil. It was here that he wrote the greater part of his opera &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;.

On 16 November 1943, Resistance fighter Missak Manouchian was arrested during a gun battle on the banks of the Seine, a few hundred yards from Évry railway station after his group had been outnumbered. A memorial marks the exact place where he was arrested. Towards the end of the war, General Patton crossed the Seine with his tanks at Évry en route from Avranches going towards the east. The anniversary of the liberation of Évry on 23 August 1944, is celebrated annually at the Patton Memorial. Note: Although there is a plaque at the site where the US Army crossed the Seine at Évry Petit Bourg claiming that General Patton crossed the Seine at this site, the claim that Patton crossed here is incorrect. Units of Patton&#x27;s 3rd Army crossed the Seine south of Paris on Aug 26, 1944 at Sens and Troyes, 20-30 mi south of Évry. The pontoon bridge at Évry Petit Bourg was constructed on Aug 26, 1944 by the 238th Engineer Combat Battalion, part of the US VII Corps under Gen. J. Lawton Collins, US First Army (Gen. Courtney Hodges). The tanks that crossed at Évry belonged to the 3d Armored Division of the US First Army, not Patton&#x27;s 3d Army.

Although Évry is a modern &quot;new town&quot;, which is generally synonymous with &quot;concrete jungle&quot;, 50% of its surface area is parkland and open space. The main thoroughfares are very wide avenues, and trees are to be found everywhere. In the nationwide intercommunal competition &quot;Ville Fleurie&quot; (flowered town) Évry has been awarded the high status of &quot;3 flowers&quot;, usually won by country villages. To encourage this aspect of the town an annual &quot;Balcon Fleuri&quot; (flowered balcony) competition is held. A similar balcony competition is held each December for the best exterior Christmas decorations.

Some people consider the modern cathedral as an architectural beauty while others liken the design to that of a blast furnace.

Évry is the home of the European space project Ariane, at the Centre National d&#x27;Études Spatiales (CNES).

==Notable personalities==
*Maud Medenou, basketball player
*Aurélien Ngeyitala, footballer
*Clement Parisse, cross-country skier
*Niska, rapper
*Koba LaD, rapper

==Twinnings==
Évry is twinned with the London Borough of Bexley in England. This is because, originally, Évry was designed to be a predominantly management and executive class town.

Évry is also twinned with Nowy Targ in Poland, Troisdorf in Germany, Estelí in Nicaragua, and Repentigny in Quebec, Canada.

The Agglomération d&#x27;Évry has twinning pacts with Kayes in Mali and Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip. (Maison du Monde, 509, Patio des Terrasses, Évry, sharing the address with a branch of Amnesty International.)

The latest addition to the overseas contacts is a &quot;parrainage&quot; (godfather) pact with Bozovici in Romania.

==Sports==

Several évryens clubs illustrated in various disciplines such as AS Evry in football (soccer) who played in the third division national league and the Paris Île-de-France, the Corsairs of Evry in American football. evolving into a second division championship and sometimes national French elite; the Peaux Rouges in ice hockey who play in the third national division, and the North South Viry Evry Essonne athletics.

The town regularly hosts national meetings such as the French Dance Federation in 1981. Being city-stage of the Tour de France in 2001, it was also bid to host the Grand Prix of France.

In June 2012, the French Rugby Federation (FFR) announced that the now-closed Ris-Orangis horse racing track in Évry had been chosen as the site for a proposed new stadium for the national rugby union team. The new ground was intended to feature 82,000 seats, a retractable roof, and a slide-out pitch, and was to be at the center of a 133-hectare shopping and entertainment complex. Plans originally called for the stadium to open in 2017, but FFR abandoned the project in December 2016 after numerous delays.

<doc id="289834" wikidata="Q133205" url="?curid=289834" title="Fenugreek">
<text>Fenugreek (; Trigonella foenum-graecum) is an annual plant in the family Fabaceae, with leaves consisting of three small obovate to oblong leaflets. It is cultivated worldwide as a semiarid crop. Its leaves and seeds are common ingredients in dishes from the Indian subcontinent, and have been used as a culinary ingredient since ancient times. Its use as a food ingredient in small quantities is safe.

Although a common dietary supplement, no significant clinical evidence suggests that fenugreek has therapeutic properties. Commonly used in traditional medicine, fenugreek can increase the risk of serious adverse effects, including allergic reactions.

==History==
Fenugreek is believed to have been brought into cultivation in the Near East. Which wild strain of the genus &quot;Trigonella&quot; gave rise to domesticated fenugreek is uncertain. Charred fenugreek seeds have been recovered from Tell Halal, Iraq (carbon dated to 4000 BC), Bronze Age levels of Lachish, and desiccated seeds from the tomb of Tutankhamen. Cato the Elder lists fenugreek with clover and vetch as crops grown to feed cattle.

In one first-century AD recipe, the Romans flavoured wine with fenugreek. In the 1st century AD, in Galilee, it was grown as a staple food, as Josephus mentions in his book, the &quot;Wars of the Jews&quot;. The plant is mentioned in the second-century compendium of Jewish Oral Law (Mishnah) under its Hebrew name &quot;tiltan&quot;.

==Etymology==
The English name derives via Middle French &quot;fenugrec&quot; from Latin &quot;faenugraecum&quot;, &quot;faenum Graecum&quot; meaning &quot;Greek hay&quot;.

==Production==
India is a major producer of fenugreek, and over 80% of India&#x27;s output is from the state of Rajasthan.

==Uses==
Fenugreek is used as a herb (dried or fresh leaves), spice (seeds), and vegetable (fresh leaves, sprouts, and microgreens). Sotolon is the chemical responsible for the distinctive maple-syrup smell of fenugreek.

Cuboid, yellow- to amber-coloured fenugreek seeds are frequently encountered in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, used both whole and powdered in the preparation of pickles, vegetable dishes, &quot;dal&quot;, and spice mixes such as &quot;panch phoron&quot; and &quot;sambar&quot; powder. They are often roasted to reduce inherent bitterness and to enhance flavour (Maillard browning).

=== Cooking ===
Fresh fenugreek leaves are an ingredient in some curries, such as with potatoes in Indian cuisines to make &quot;aloo methi&quot; (potato fenugreek) curry.

In Armenian cuisine, fenugreek seed powder is used to make a paste that is an important ingredient to cover dried and cured beef to make &quot;basturma&quot;.

In Iranian cuisine, fenugreek leaves are called &quot;shambalileh&quot;. They are one of several greens incorporated into the herb stew &quot;ghormeh sabzi&quot;, the herb frittata &quot;kuku sabzi&quot;, and a soup known as &quot;eshkeneh&quot;. 

In Georgian cuisine, a related species—&quot;Trigonella caerulea&quot; called &quot;blue fenugreek&quot;—is used. 

In Egyptian cuisine, fenugreek is known by the Arabic name &quot;hilba&quot; or &quot;helba&quot; حلبة. Seeds are boiled to make a drink that is consumed at home, as well as in coffee shops. Peasants in Upper Egypt add fenugreek seeds and maize to their pita bread to produce &quot;aish merahrah&quot;, a staple of their diet. &quot;Basterma&quot;, a cured ,dried beef, gets its distinctive flavour from the fenugreek used as a coating.

In the same way in Turkish cuisine, fenugreek seed powder, called &quot;çemen&quot;, is used to make a paste with paprika powder and garlic to cover dried and cured beef in making &quot;pastirma/basturma&quot;. (Its name comes from the Turkish verb &quot;bastırmak&quot;, meaning &quot;to press&quot;).

In Moroccan cuisine, fenugreek is used in &quot;rfissa&quot;, a dish associated with the countryside.

Fenugreek is used in Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisines. The word for fenugreek in Amharic is &quot;abesh&quot; (or &quot;abish&quot;), and the seed is used in Ethiopia as a natural herbal medicine in the treatment of diabetes.

Yemenite Jews following the interpretation of Rabbi Shelomo Yitzchak (Rashi) believe fenugreek, which they call &quot;hilbah, hilbeh, hilba, helba&quot;, or&quot; halba&quot; &quot;חילבה&quot;, to be the Talmudic &quot;rubia&quot;. When the seed kernels are ground and mixed with water, they greatly expand; hot spices, turmeric, and lemon juice are added to produce a frothy relish eaten with a sop. The relish is also called &quot;hilbeh&quot;; it is reminiscent of curry. It is eaten daily and ceremonially during the meal of the first and/or second night of the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashana.

In Yemen, a small amount of &quot;oud al hilba&quot; (عود الحلبة), which appears to be the same as &quot;ashwagandha&quot;, is traditionally added to ground fenugreek seeds before they are mixed with water to prepare the &quot;hulbah&quot; paste. This is believed to aid in digestion and more importantly to prevent or lessen the maple-syrup smell that usually occurs when consuming fenugreek.

===Nutritional profile===
In a 100-gram reference amount, fenugreek seeds provide of food energy and contain 9% water, 58% carbohydrates, 23% protein, and 6% fat. Fenugreek seeds provide calcium at 14% of the Daily Value (DV, table). Fenugreek seeds (per 100 grams) are a rich source of protein (46% DV), dietary fiber, B vitamins, and dietary minerals, particularly manganese (59% DV) and iron (262% DV) (table).

===Dietary supplement===
Fenugreek dietary supplements are manufactured from powdered seeds into capsules, loose powders, teas, and liquid extracts in many countries. No high-quality evidence supports that these products have any clinical effectiveness.

===Animal feed===
Fenugreek is sometimes used as animal feed. It provides a green fodder palatable to ruminants. The seeds are also used to feed fish and domestic rabbits.

===Food additive===
Fenugreek seeds and leaves contain sotolone, which imparts the aroma of fenugreek and curry in high concentrations, and maple syrup or caramel in lower concentrations. Fenugreek is used as a flavoring agent in imitation maple syrup or tea, and as a dietary supplement.

==Research==
Constituents of fenugreek seeds include flavonoids, alkaloids, coumarins, vitamins, and saponins; the most prevalent alkaloid is trigonelline and coumarins include cinnamic acid and scopoletin. Research into whether fenugreek reduces biomarkers in people with diabetes and with prediabetic conditions is of limited quality. 

As of 2023, no high-quality evidence has been found for whether fenugreek is safe and effective in relieving dysmenorrhea or improving lactation during breastfeeding. Studies of fenugreek are characterized as having variable, poor experimental design and quality, including small numbers of subjects, failure to describe methods, inconsistency and duration of dosing, and not recording adverse effects.

Because research on the potential biological effects of consuming fenugreek has provided no high-quality evidence for health or antidisease effect, fenugreek is not approved or recommended for clinical use by the United States Food and Drug Administration.

==Traditional medicine==
Although once a folk remedy for an insufficient milk supply when nursing, no good evidence indicates that fenugreek is effective or safe for this use, nor is it useful in traditional practices for treating dysmenorrhea, inflammation, diabetes, or any human disorder.

==Adverse effects and allergies==
The use of fenugreek has the potential for serious adverse effects, as it may be unsafe for women with hormone-sensitive cancers. Fenugreek is not safe for use during pregnancy, as it has possible abortifacient effects and may induce preterm uterine contractions.

Some people are allergic to fenugreek, including those with peanut allergy or chickpea allergy. Fenugreek seeds can cause diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal distention, flatulence, and perspiration, and impart a maple-like smell to sweat, urine, or breast milk. A risk of hypoglycemia exists, particularly in people with diabetes, and it may interfere with the activity of antidiabetic drugs. Because of the high content of coumarin-like compounds in fenugreek, it may interfere with the activity and dosing of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs.

Fenugreek sprouts, cultivated from a single specific batch of seeds imported from Egypt into Germany in 2009, were implicated as the source of the 2011 outbreak of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; O104:H4 in Germany and France. Identification of a common producer and a single batch of fenugreek seeds was evidence for the origin of the outbreaks.

<text>Wakefield is one of many villages of the municipality of La Pêche, with the village centre on the western shore of the Gatineau River, at the confluence of the La Pêche River in the Outaouais region of the province of Quebec in Canada. It is thirty-five kilometres northwest of Ottawa, Ontario. The village, named after the city of Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England, is now the southern edge of the municipality of La Pêche, and was founded in 1830 by Irish, Scottish, and English immigrants. Wakefield is approximately a twenty-five-minute drive north of the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge that divides Gatineau and Ottawa (Ontario), along the Autoroute 5, a modern four lane divided highway which has recently been extended to the village. Wakefield is unique as a primarily Anglophone town in a primarily Francophone province.

==History==
The village&#x27;s primary industry is tourism. Attractions in the region include the Gendron covered bridge spanning the Gatineau River; the Wakefield Documentary Film Festival; the Black Sheep Inn (Auberge Mouton Noir), a legendary live music venue; The Wakefield Mill Hotel and Spa, a 4-star hotel, restaurant and spa with views of the Maclaren Falls, and Eco-Odyssee, a navigable water maze.

The village provides access points to Gatineau Park near the junction of Route Principale and Highway 5, and also at the Wakefield Mill. During the summer months until 2011, a tourist steam train ran daily from Gatineau to Wakefield via Chelsea along the Gatineau River.
Recreational activities in and around the village include horseback riding, skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, tubing, snowmobiling, dog sledding, golf, canoeing, and kayaking. There is an unsupervised and unofficial swimming area beneath the covered bridge that attracts thousands of people from the surrounding area every summer.

The Wakefield community has a &quot;thriving arts scene&quot;.

&quot;Grey Owl&quot; was partially filmed here in 1999.

Since 2011 the village has hosted the Wakefield Covered Bridge Run. The Marathon of Health along with the Wakefield community created the running event to raise money for organizations that promote healthy and active lifestyles through sports.

The village has developed a reputation for a somewhat bohemian lifestyle and boasts a number of small cafes, pubs, and galleries. Many young families live in the area, enjoying its lifestyle, services, and resources. Many artists live in the surrounding mountains and valleys.

Public buildings include the Wakefield Memorial Hospital, an elementary school, the MRC des Collines Police Station, the Daycare Centre Éveil de la nature, the Wakefield Retirement Home, and a municipal library. A weekly regional newspaper, &quot;The Low Down to Hull and Back News&quot; (a play on the Gatineau River communities from Low downstream to Hull), is also published in the village.

Former Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson is buried in Maclaren Cemetery in Wakefield.

<doc id="289840" wikidata="Q3315767" url="?curid=289840" title="Mesquite">
<text>Mesquite is a common name for some plants in the genera &quot;Neltuma&quot; and &quot;Strombocarpa&quot;, which contain over 50 species of spiny, deep-rooted leguminous shrubs and small trees. They are native to dry areas in the Americas. Until 2022, these genera were traditionally included in a broad view of the genus &quot;Prosopis&quot;, but that genus is now restricted to a few species native to the Old World.

Mesquites have extremely long roots to seek water from very far under ground. As they are legumes, mesquites are one of the few sources of fixed nitrogen in the desert habitat. The trees bloom from spring to summer. They often produce fruits known as &quot;pods&quot;. Mesquites are able to grow up to tall, depending on site and climate. They are deciduous and depending on location and rainfall have either deep or shallow roots. Mesquites are considered long-lived because of the low mortality rate after the dicotyledonous stage and juveniles are also able to survive in conditions with low light and drought. The Cahuilla indigenous people of western North America were known to eat the seeds of mesquite.

== History ==
Mesquites have been in North America since the Pliocene era and their wood has been dated to 3300 yr BP. They are thought to have evolved with megafauna in the New World. The loss of North American megafauna at the end of the Pleistocene era gave way to one theory of how mesquites were able to survive. One theory is that the loss of the megafauna allowed mesquites to use their fruit pods to attract other organisms to spread their seeds; then, with the introduction of livestock, they were able to spread into grasslands. Another is that mesquites had always been present in grasslands, but recurring fires had delayed plant and seed development before the emergence of livestock and grazing.

==Etymology==
The English word mesquite is borrowed from the Spanish word &quot;mezquite&quot;, which in turn was borrowed from the Nāhuatl term &quot;mizquitl&quot;.

==Habitat==
Mesquites grow as a small shrub in shallow soil or as tall as in deep soil with adequate moisture, and forms a rounded canopy nearly as wide. They may have one or multiple trunks with a multitude of branches. They have bipinnate leaflets of a light green to blue hue that cast a light to deep shade, depending on the species. Spikes of flowers form in spring and summer that form a flat pod of beans long. Many species form thorns. When cut to the ground, the tree can often recover.

==Uses==
Once the pod is dry, the whole pod is edible and can be ground into flour and made into bread.

Mesquite wood was a popular type of wood used by early Spaniards to build ships, but is now used most commonly for high-end rustic furniture and cabinets. Scraps and small pieces are used commonly as wood for cooking with smoke in Western, South Central American states.

Red-orange sap can be found on the branches of mesquite trees during the summer. This sap was used by those who lived in the desert for several medicinal treatments. The sap was used as a salve and spread on burns and cuts to speed up the healing process. Gargling a mixture of water and sap was used to soothe sore throats, and the same mixture was said to be able to cure upset stomachs.

==As an introduced and invasive species==

Some mesquites are different from most invasive species because they are highly aggressive in both their native and introduced ranges. Their impacts on the invaded ecosystems include changes to hydrological, energy, and nutrient cycling, as well as consequences to biodiversity and primary production. Mesquite density and canopy cover influence the herbaceous layer and native shrubs and are factors in the changes to the ecosystem.
===In its native range===
In the United States, mesquites have become the dominant woody plant on of semiarid grasslands. Although North America is in their native range, due to an imbalance within this ecosystem it has been able to spread rapidly. It is considered the most common and widely spread &quot;pest&quot; plant in Texas. An estimated 25% of Texas grasslands are infested and are so invaded that it is suppressing the majority of grass production. In Mexico and the US, the two most problematic species are honey mesquite (&quot;Neltuma glandulosa&quot;) and velvet mesquite (&quot;Neltuma velutina&quot;).
===As an introduced species===
Honey and other mesquites have been introduced to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. Honey mesquite is considered by the World Conservation Union as one of the world&#x27;s most problematic invasive species. Its spread into grasslands is mostly attributed to the introduction of domestic livestock, although other factors include climate change, overgrazing, and the reduction of fire frequency. The similar, related &quot;Prosopis&quot; species occur naturally in these areas, but these changes have resulted in these non-native relatives being able to successfully outcompete the native species, and they are now considered invasive species because they are able to take advantage of vulnerable ecosystems.

In Australia &quot;Neltuma&quot; spp. (&quot;N. pallida&quot;, &quot;N. glandulosa&quot;, &quot;N. velutina&quot;, and their hybrids with &quot;N. juliflora&quot;) are ranked nationally as one of the 20 most significant weeds. They now cover almost of land. &quot;Neltuma&quot; species were originally introduced to help with erosion because of their deep root systems.

Additionally &quot;N. laevigata&quot; was previously invasive in Australia, but has since been eradicated. The last known specimens of &quot;N. laevigata&quot; were eliminated in 2006, but given the possibility of lingering seeds in the soil seed bank, Biosecurity Queensland waited 15 years and declared Australia free of &quot;N. laevigata&quot; in 2021.

In India, mesquites had been introduced decades ago, but until recently, their effects had not been studied. This genus has been pushing out the Indian wild ass (&quot;Equus hemionus khur&quot;). This herbivorous mammal eats the pods of mesquites, which was one of the intended purposes of its introduction. Through digesting and excreting the seeds, the Indian wild asses are providing the habitat needed for germination. The Indian Wild Ass Sanctuary is experiencing mesquite invasion of roughly a year. By overtaking the land, the dense canopy cover of mesquite has made it so native vegetation cannot grow. It has also made watering holes inaccessible to the animals within this region. This lack of resources and range is forcing the endangered Indian wild ass into human landscapes and agriculture fields and locals are killing these asses to protect their crops.

=== Control strategies ===
Controlling mesquite is a challenging task. One often-used method is mechanical control. This can be effective with high mortality rates if stems are cut at least underground. Another method is through the application of herbicides, done on an individual plant basis. Basal application is effective to mesquite of all sizes, while foliar application is best for plants smaller than . Another physical option for control is through fires. Some species of mesquite are fire-sensitive, while others are fire-tolerant. For those that are fire-sensitive, this method can be highly effective, but those that are fire-tolerant require hot and intense fires to be effective. In Australia, scientists are trying biological control methods. They have introduced multiple insects, but the most effective in causing high population level impact is the leaf-tying moth (&quot;Evippe&quot; spp.). The most recommended method for managing mesquites, both in native and introduced ranges, is by targeting large numbers of plants either through herbicide or physical removal. Also, research is being done on using satellite and aerial images to assess canopy cover and determine which ranges should be targeted.

<doc id="289843" wikidata="Q6531617" url="?curid=289843" title="Lesser of two evils principle">
<text>The lesser of two evils principle, also referred to as the lesser evil principle and lesser-evilism, is the principle that when faced with selecting from two immoral options, the least immoral one should be chosen. The principle is most often invoked in reference to binary political choices under systems that make it impossible to express a sincere preference for one&#x27;s favorite.

== Origin ==
The maxim existed already in Platonic philosophy. In Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle writes: &quot;For the lesser evil can be seen in comparison with the greater evil as a good, since this lesser evil is preferable to the greater one, and whatever preferable is good&quot;. The modern formulation was popularized by Thomas à Kempis&#x27; devotional book &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; written in early 15th century.

In part IV of his &quot;Ethics&quot;, Spinoza states the following maxim:
== In modern elections ==
The concept of &quot;lesser evil&quot; voting (LEV) can be seen as a form of the minimax strategy (&quot;minimize maximum loss&quot;) where voters, when faced with two or more candidates, choose the one they perceive as the most likely to do harm and vote for the one most likely to defeat him, or the &quot;lesser evil.&quot; To do so, &quot;voting should not be viewed as a form of personal self-expression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values, or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites&quot; rather as an opportunity to reduce harm or loss. 

Hannah Arendt argued that &quot;Those who choose the lesser evil forget very quickly that they chose evil&quot;. In contrast Seyla Benhabib argues that politics would not exist without the necessity to choose between a greater and a lesser evil. When limited to the two most likely candidates, &quot;lesser evil&quot; is the most likely &quot;greater good&quot;, for the &quot;common good&quot;, as Pope Francis has said.

In 2012, &quot;Huffington Post&quot; columnist Sanford Jay Rosen stated that refusal to vote for the lesser of two evils became common practice for left-leaning voters in the United States due to their overwhelming disapproval of the United States government&#x27;s support for the Vietnam War. Rosen stated: &quot;Beginning with the 1968 presidential election, I often have heard from liberals that they could not vote for the lesser of two evils. Some said they would not vote; some said they would vote for a third-party candidate. That mantra delivered us to Richard Nixon in 1972 until Watergate did him in. And it delivered us to George W. Bush and Dick Cheney in 2000 until they were termed out in 2009&quot;.

In the 2016 United States presidential election, both major candidates of the major parties — Hillary Clinton (D) and Donald Trump (R) — had disapproval ratings close to 60% by August 2016. Green Party candidate Jill Stein invoked this idea in her campaign stating, &quot;Don&#x27;t vote for the lesser evil, fight for the greater good&quot;. Green Party votes hurt Democratic chances in 2000 and 2016. This sentiment was repeated for the next two election cycles, both of which were between Trump and Democratic candidates Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024. Accordingly, the lesser evil principle should be applied to two front-runners among many choices, after eliminating from consideration &quot;minor party candidates (who) can be spoilers in elections by taking away enough votes from a major party candidate to influence the outcome without winning.&quot;

In his &quot;DarkHorse&quot; podcast, Bret Weinstein describes his &quot;Unity 2020&quot; proposal for the 2020 presidential election as an option that, in case of failure, would not asymmetrically weaken voters&#x27; second-best choice on a single political side, thereby avoiding the &quot;lesser evil paradox&quot;.

In elections between only two candidates where one is mildly unpopular and the other immensely unpopular, opponents of both candidates frequently advocate a vote for the mildly unpopular candidate. For example, in the second round of the 2002 French presidential election graffiti in Paris told people to &quot;vote for the crook, not the fascist&quot;. The &quot;crook&quot; in those scribbled public messages was Jacques Chirac of Rally for the Republic and the &quot;fascist&quot; was Jean-Marie Le Pen of the National Front. Chirac eventually won the second round having garnered 82% of the vote.

== Mythology ==

&quot;Between Scylla and Charybdis&quot; is an idiom derived from Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. In the story, Odysseus chose to go near Scylla as the lesser of two evils. He lost six of his companions, but if he had gone near Charybdis all would be doomed. Because of such stories, having to navigate between the two hazards eventually entered idiomatic use. 

An equivalent English seafaring phrase is &quot;Between a rock and a hard place&quot;. The Latin line &quot;incidit in scyllam cupiens vitare charybdim&quot; (&quot;he runs into Scylla, wishing to avoid Charybdis&quot;) had earlier become proverbial, with a meaning much the same as jumping from the frying pan into the fire. Erasmus recorded it as an ancient proverb in his &quot;Adagia&quot;, although the earliest known instance is in the &quot;Alexandreis&quot;, a 12th-century Latin epic poem by Walter of Châtillon.

<doc id="289844" wikidata="Q670661" url="?curid=289844" title="Alfred Packer">
<text>Alfred Griner Packer (January 21, 1842 – April 23, 1907), also known as the &quot;Colorado Cannibal&quot;, was an American prospector and self-proclaimed wilderness guide who confessed to cannibalism during the winter of 1874. Though no clear or definitive evidence has been found to this day, and despite in-depth research about proof of his deeds, he is one of the four persons historically convicted for cannibalism in the United States. After emerging as the sole survivor of a six-man party who had attempted to travel through the San Juan Mountains of the Colorado Territory, he eventually confessed to having lived off the flesh of his companions, giving more than one version of his account as to the circumstances.

After his story was called into question, Packer escaped jail and hid from justice for nine years. He was eventually tried, convicted of premeditated murder, and sentenced to death. Packer won a retrial, and was eventually sentenced to 40 years in prison on five counts of voluntary manslaughter.

An almost completely fictitious biopic of his exploits, &quot;The Legend of Alfred Packer&quot;, was released in 1980. A more comedic and heavily fabricated take on the story, titled &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot;, was released in 1993.

==Early life==
Alfred Griner Packer was born in an unincorporated area of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, on January 21, 1842. He was one of three children born to James Packer, and Esther Packer (née Griner) By the early 1850s, Packer&#x27;s father had moved his family to LaGrange County, Indiana, where he worked as a cabinetmaker. Packer is said to have had a bitter relationship with his parents, and in his late teens he moved to Minnesota and worked as a shoemaker.

==Career==
Packer served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He enlisted on April 22, 1862, in Winona, Minnesota, and was assigned to Company F of the 16th Infantry Regiment. Eight months later he was honorably discharged due to epilepsy, which had triggered seizures. On June 25, 1863, Packer enlisted in the 8th Iowa Cavalry Regiment at Ottumwa, Iowa, only for his epilepsy to result in a second discharge on April 22, 1864.

Packer then traveled west, and worked at numerous jobs over the next nine years. These professions included being a hunter, wagon teamster, ranch hand, and field worker, but his seizures and overall attitude ensured that he never kept a job for long. Packer also worked for a couple of months as a guide, but those who knew him at this time later stated that he was ill-suited to the role and was prone to losing his way. He ended up working mining-related jobs, drifting from mine to mine, but never found prosperity through the industry. He worked for a short time in the Colorado Territory as a miner but, having no luck, moved on to the Utah Territory.

Most who knew Packer generally disliked and distrusted him, owing to his argumentative personality, his nearly pathological lying, and his reputation for theft.

==Expedition==
Having heard of gold that had been discovered in Breckenridge, Robert McGrue found a party of twenty ready to join him and make the trip from Salt Lake City to the San Juan Mountains, south of Colorado Territory. The men, who were largely strangers to each other, left by November 1873. One of them, George Tracy, declared that the party encountered a 23-year-old man called Alfred Packer near Provo. After they told him they were headed to the gold country of the San Juan Mountains, Packer said he would like to join them, claiming he was both a prospector and a guide, and that he knew the San Juan territory well. As he had no provisions, he offered $25 to join the band. The prospectors, who needed a guide, accepted Packer&#x27;s help.

On the first part of the trip to the San Juan Mountains, members of McGrue&#x27;s party later said that he had apparently overstated his experience of being familiar to the area, or had even possibly fabricated his qualifications altogether. He was also reported as being without a rifle at the time the expedition left, having only a Colt revolver with him. Throughout the course of their journey, Packer was reported as being greedy with rations, lazy, and obstinate. He apparently was obsessed with how much money the members had brought with them for the journey. He was reported to have quarreled constantly with party member Frank Miller. At the time of his first trial, Packer was characterized as a &quot;whining fraud&quot; by party member Preston Nutter. His epileptic seizures also made his presence in the group apparently strenuous. Moreover, there were rumours about Packer having spent time in jail in Salt Lake City, on the charge of having murdered a hunting partner.

Despite the presence of Packer as a guide, the party progressed more slowly than expected towards Breckenridge. The winter proved to be a major obstacle for them, crippling wagons and horses. While progressing along the Spanish Trail they encountered heavy snow which hid the path, forcing the party members to rely almost solely on a compass. Packer&#x27;s inexperience was also beginning to show itself, and the party ultimately became lost. Provisions quickly ran out, and the men were reduced to surviving first on horse feed, and were nearing the point where they would consider eating the horses themselves. 

===Chief Ouray&#x27;s camp===

On January 21, 1874, the party came upon the encampment of Chief Ouray, known as the &quot;White Man&#x27;s Friend&quot;, near Montrose, Colorado, set in the Uncompahgre Valley. Though desperate, the party still approached the camp with anxiety, unsure of how they would be received by the tribe. However, Chief Ouray supplied them with food and lodging and recommended they postpone their expedition until spring, since they were likely to encounter dangerous winter weather in the mountains. He told them that no Ute would attempt such a journey, and that to chance it would be to risk almost certain death. Ouray offered to allow the men to stay with his tribe until the winter had passed, and promised to share all that he and his people had with them. Regardless of these warnings, eleven men decided to proceed on. They intended to travel first to the Los Pinós Indian Agency, which was the closest outpost to the camp, and proceed onward to Breckenridge. Chief Ouray provided them with food for their journey, as well as safe directions to bypass the mountains. Packer, however, was in favor of getting to the agency by going through the mountains, stating it was a more direct route. The party cut in two, with five men following Oliver Loutsenhizer along the Gunnison River, and six others, among them Packer, heading through the San Juan Mountains. Had Packer wanted to follow the other group, Loutsenhizer threatened that he would shoot him.

===Second departure===

On February 9, Packer and the five others in his party left for the Los Pinós Indian Agency, 75 miles ahead. Besides Packer, the group comprised George &quot;California&quot; Noon, a teenager; Israel Swan, an elderly man and rumored to be carrying around thousands in cash; James Humphrey; Frank &quot;Butcher&quot; Miller, a butcher from Germany; and the red-haired Shannon Wilson Bell. The fact that no one in the other group opposed the departure of their &quot;guide&quot; has led many researchers to conclude that Packer&#x27;s inexperience and overall attitude had become quite taxing to them, and that they figured they were better off without him. The leader of the combined parties, Bob McGrue, guided Packer&#x27;s men along the river route advised by Chief Ouray until his horses could not continue. McGrue unloaded the men&#x27;s provisions and went back to Ouray&#x27;s camp. The men continued along the Gunnison River for a time, before Packer took his party along a path higher up in the San Juan Mountains, disregarding Ouray&#x27;s warning. This decision was made when the men barely had enough food to cover the supposed 14 days it would take to travel the safest route, possessed no snowshoes, had a bare minimum of matches and no flint, and also had no heavy clothing that would help against the extreme cold. They went into the mountains with two rifles, one pistol, a couple of knives, a hatchet, and minimal ammunition.

==Aftermath==
On April 16, 1874, 65 days after his departure, Packer emerged from the woods alone and made his way across a frozen lake bed to the Los Pinós Indian Agency, near Saguache, Colorado. As the men of the agency were eating breakfast, Packer came in and stood before them begging for food and shelter. He carried with him a rifle, a knife, a steel coffee pot, and a satchel. The men sat Packer down at the table and gave him some food, which he could not ingest without vomiting. Packer said that his digestion was altered as a result of his prolonged near-starvation. Then he related to the men the events that had led him from Ouray&#x27;s camp to Los Piños. He said he had been hired by five men to guide them to Breckenridge. He then stated that during their journey, he had become snow-blind and was left lagging behind the party, becoming a burden for them. Packer claimed that a member of the party, Israel Swan, had supplied him with a rifle, just before the others decided to abandon him. Since this moment he had been forced to survive on his own and make his way out of the mountains with minimal ammunition and virtually no supplies. He indicated he had little else to eat than roots and rose buds the entire time he was alone. He had also eaten his moccasins. The men at the agency listened to his story, but found it rather odd, that even though he had been lost in the wilderness for a little over two months, he did not look as malnourished and threadbare as most lost wanderers they had come across in the mountains. His face was reported as being bloated, and his overall physique hardly skeletal. Moreover, Packer said he would drink whisky for breakfast, instead of any kind of food. Packer claimed he was broke, and sold the Winchester rifle he had in his possession to Major Downer, the agency&#x27;s justice of the peace, for $10 (). Packer stayed at the agency for ten days before heading to the nearby town of Saguache, where he began to buy supplies for his journey back home in Pennsylvania.

===Arrival of Preston Nutter===

When he reached Saguache, Packer bought a horse for $70 () and booked a room at Dolan&#x27;s Saloon. Larry Dolan, the owner, later claimed that Packer spent around $100 () during his stay, and that Packer even offered to lend him $300. Packer spent an additional $78 in Otto Mears&#x27; general store. It was also claimed that he had several different wallets in his possession. He stayed in Saguache until Preston Nutter, a member of the original party who remained at Ouray&#x27;s camp, arrived in town with two other original party members. He encountered Packer in Dolan&#x27;s Saloon. Nutter asked Packer where the rest of his party was, with Packer claiming that he had &quot;got his feet wet and frozen&quot;. He stated that they had set up camp when a winter storm set in, and he started a fire to warm up while the others went ahead to look for food. Packer claimed that Swan left him with his rifle in case of trouble and that they never returned. Presuming they had abandoned him, he had left and made his way through the mountains, feeding mainly on rosebuds and small animals. Considering that Packer looked rather well-fed, and that it would be a fatal choice for five miners unfamiliar with Colorado to abandon their so-called guide in the middle of snowbound mountains, Nutter found Packer&#x27;s story odd. It also was peculiar that Israel Swan would give Packer his rifle, leaving a group of four persons with only one rifle as hunting means. Additionally, he noted that Packer had in his possession a skinning knife that had belonged to Frank Miller. When Nutter asked, Packer claimed that Miller had stuck it in a tree and walked off without it. Doubtful about Packer&#x27;s story, convinced that something wrong had happened, Nutter started to fight with Packer. Nutter later stated, regarding Packer, &quot;He was sulky, obstinate and quarrelsome. He was a petty thief willing to take things that did not belong to him, whether of any value or not.&quot; The two men were separated, and Packer kept on preparing his departure from Saguache.

===Arrival of Loutsenhizer===

Meanwhile, two men of the five-man party that had taken the Gunnison River route finally arrived at the Los Pinós Indian Agency. They were joined a few days later by the remaining three men, including Loutsenhizer. The men were introduced to the head of the agency, General Charles Adams, who told them he had already met another member of their party by the name of Alfred Packer – and that he spoke of desertion at the hands of his companions. All five men at once discredited what Packer had told the General and his staff, stating that the men that they had known would never abandon a man to die. Loutsenhizer told the General that Packer was not to be trusted, and expressed suspicion about Packer&#x27;s stories. He noted the Winchester rifle carried in by Packer belonged to an elderly man in Packer&#x27;s party and that a pipe he had left behind at the agency belonged to a man named Shannon Bell, who was also a member of his party. The men convinced General Adams to dispatch a mounted agency officer to Saguache at once to retrieve Packer for questioning, but under the guise of recruiting him for a search party for the missing men. Packer was in the process of getting his things gathered to leave the area when he was again approached by Nutter and some other men. The agency officer arrived just in time and got between the men. He told Packer he had been sent to enlist him as a guide for the search party for the missing men. Packer was reluctant to go, but with little other option than vigilante justice, he agreed. He mounted his recently purchased horse and followed the officer back to Los Pinós.

===Different truths===

Upon arriving at the agency, Packer met General Adams, and five men he had not seen since February. The agency officer came in after Packer and relayed to General Adams that a man named Preston Nutter had told him Packer had spent several hundred dollars over his six-week stay in Saguache as well as buying a new horse and saddle, that he was in possession of things that belonged to missing men, and that he was penniless when he had originally joined their party. Loutsenhizer demanded an explanation from Packer, who repeated the story exactly as he had told it the first time. Packer showed amazement that the men had not been heard from, and was concerned for their well-being. When Loutsenhizer asked where his newly acquired wealth came from, Packer stated that he had received a cash loan from a man in Saguache. Adams told Packer that he would send an officer to Saguache to verify his story. The officer returned soon with news from various sources that Packer had been seen with several different wallets and had told varying stories regarding his journey, and that he had arrived in Saguache with plenty of cash, and that no one in town claimed to have lent him a penny. Adams convened a council of the five members : himself, Packer, and the agency officers. As they were beginning to settle the matter, two Ute tribesmen arrived in Los Piños, holding strips of dried human flesh which they had found on a hill near the agency while hunting. Packer then begged for mercy, swearing to make a full confession, saying to Adams: &quot;It would not be the first time that people had been obliged to eat each other when they were hungry.&quot; This sentence opened what was to become one of several different official statements, over the next three decades.

Herman Lauter, the agency clerk, was in attendance and transcribed Packer&#x27;s first official statement. Packer claimed that the men had left Ouray&#x27;s camp with what they thought was sufficient food for the anticipated 14-day journey ahead of them. Sooner than expected, he said, provisions were exhausted. They survived for days on roots dug from the ground, pine gum, rose buds, and the occasional rabbit. After a few days of no wildlife activity due to the extreme cold and eating virtually nothing but roots, he claimed that the men started to eye each other in an unsettling way. A few days after this, he left camp to gather dry firewood and returned to find four men around the slain body of Israel Swan, who had been struck in the head with a hatchet and killed instantly. The four started to butcher Swan, with Packer accepting the situation and joining them. He claimed several thousand dollars was found on Swan&#x27;s person and divided between the men. They consumed the most agreeable parts of Swan&#x27;s body, packed some up, and moved on, with Packer appropriating Swan&#x27;s rifle. Within two days, however, the five men were again out of meat, and game continued to elude them. Packer, Bell, Humphrey, and Noon decided in secret that Miller would be the next to go. Packer confessed that Miller was a stocky man, and was chosen for his amount of soft flesh. He was killed with a hatchet blow to the head, while he was stooping to pick up wood for the fire, then butchered and consumed. Packer took Miller&#x27;s knife, and Miller&#x27;s share of Swan&#x27;s money was redistributed among the four men, who then moved on to Los Pinós.

The winter was relentless and the men were slow-moving, barely able to see in front of them, cursing the wind that was cutting at their exposed skin. Humphrey was next to be sacrificed, followed before too long by George Noon. At last it was just down to Bell and Packer. He claimed that the two men swore not to eat each other. They each had a rifle at this point and a couple of thousand dollars of Swan&#x27;s cash, and presumed that two men would fare well on the remainder of their trip with what minimal game there was to be found. They agreed they would say the four men had perished from the elements and were buried with dignity, vowing never to speak of the cannibalism. They felt no one would ever believe it was as &quot;necessary&quot; as they had. After trekking for a few days, with little else eaten other than a rabbit and some roots, the men were exhausted and set up camp next to a large lake that was skirted on one side by a large grove of hemlock trees. Packer said that a few days after this, Bell snapped up out of his blanket and screamed that he could not take it anymore. He told Packer that one of them was going to die for food. He snatched his rifle and sprinted at Packer with it readied to bash his skull in. Packer deflected the blow and struck Bell in the head with the hatchet. He claimed that at this point the only fear he had left was to starve to death. He then butchered Bell, eating as much as he could in preparation for the remaining leg of his journey, and packed a good amount away. He relieved Bell of his share of Swan&#x27;s money and then headed on, unsure how far he was from anywhere or whether he was even going to survive. After a while he mounted a hill and saw at long last the Los Pinós Indian Agency. He threw the remaining strips of Bell&#x27;s flesh away, presuming that an animal would hastily eat them, and admitted that he did so with a fair degree of hesitation.

General Adams called for a conference among the five men and the agency officers to determine the next course of action. It was decided that a search party would be assembled at once to find the men&#x27;s remains. The five original party members claimed that they did not believe one single part of Packer&#x27;s story. General Adams asked of the two Ute men if they knew of an area next to a lake that Packer had described. They said that such a place existed roughly 50 miles away, across the hills. The search party was headed by agency clerk Herman Lauter and consisted of the five miners from Utah, a few agency officers, and Packer acting as guide. After two weeks, as the party was reaching the area of the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River, Packer claimed he was lost and that he did not recognize the surroundings. Nothing was found, and the party headed back to the agency. Along their route back, Packer attempted to murder Herman Lauter with a knife. He was caught in the act, restrained, and arrested. General Adams had been willing to believe Packer up to this point, but the unprovoked attempt made on his officer&#x27;s life convinced him that Packer was dangerous. He was transported to Saguache and jailed by the sheriff outside the town itself for his own protection.

===First confession===

During Packer&#x27;s detention, he retracted what he had told the men at the agency about the events leading up to the five men losing their lives. He now claimed that the men had encountered a strong blizzard along their way through the mountains. The snow fell so heavily and persistently that they became hopelessly lost, and were unable to retrace their steps back to their starting point. Provisions were already minimal when they began the trek, and quickly ran out. They just as quickly ran out of matches, and were forced to carry hot embers in a steel coffee pot to have a means to light fires. Days went by with no signs of game, and attempts at ice fishing proved utterly futile. After roasting and eating their shoes and attempting to survive on what scant and edible vegetation they could find, the men, claimed Packer, entered into a pact whereby if one died, his meat would serve to save the others from starvation. After days of hiking with virtually nothing to eat, Israel Swan could go no further, and the others were dangerously fatigued. They found a pine-shaded gulch next to a lake, and set up camp. A short time after this, Swan died of a combination of hunger and exposure, according to Packer.

Packer signed his first confession:

In Packer&#x27;s later amended version of this story, the men had endured almost 20 days from Ouray&#x27;s camp and more than 10 without any substantial food at all. Packer elaborated that James Humphrey had also died of exposure to the extreme cold, and that George Noon was killed days later by Shannon Bell for the sole purpose of food, after there was no more substantial meat to be had from the three fallen men. Then it was just down to Bell and himself. He claimed that he and Bell had agreed that they would stand together until the end, swearing not to eat each other. Days went by, and Bell could no longer take the hunger and rushed at Packer with his rifle, intending to bludgeon him with its stock. Packer then shot Bell with his pistol. Packer confessed to taking the valuables of the deceased members, claiming they no longer needed them, but made no statements as to the exact items taken nor to the amount of money accrued. While he was in jail, observers challenged his credibility and noted that Packer, far from being a victim of cold or starvation, had probably set a trap and led his group in the middle of the hills to kill and rob them.

===Discovery of the bodies===

The following August, the site of the incident was found by John A. Randolph, an illustrator who worked for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; magazine. He discovered all five of the bodies at the foot of Slumgullion Pass, two miles southeast of Lake City, Colorado, in a pine-shaded gulch skirted by hemlock trees. They lay above the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River, now known colloquially as Dead Man&#x27;s Gulch, which matched the description of where Packer had originally claimed that only Bell was killed. The snow that had been covering the bodies and campsite had melted in the intervening four months. Randolph sketched the scene as he found it, and then alerted authorities in nearby Lake City. The story was covered two months later in the October 17, 1874, edition of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, and included his illustration of the site.

The local coroner and law enforcement set out for the site along with about 20 volunteers and discovered the bodies of all five men in various states of decomposition, having been left to the elements and animals for four months. First responders to the site noted that it appeared that &quot;extreme violence&quot; had befallen the men. Frank Miller&#x27;s head was missing entirely from the campsite; his and Israel Swan&#x27;s corpses had been considerably worked upon by scavengers and were little more than scattered bones. Israel&#x27;s skull had a jagged chunk missing out of it. The bodies of George Noon and James Humphrey were largely flayed torsos of rotting viscera, attached to skeletal legs, but with intact and bearded faces, with Humphrey&#x27;s face being slightly more decayed than Noon&#x27;s. They had received blows to the head, the shape indicating perhaps a hatchet, and their bodies had noticeable broken bones. Shannon Bell lay with largely skeletal legs splayed and arms to his sides that were crudely cut to their bones leading to hands that were still fully skinned. His remaining corpse was a mass of viscera encased in an almost wholly flayed torso. His face was still wearing a thick red beard and bushy hair. The lack of noticeable decay in his face suggested that he had been the last to die. The top of Bell&#x27;s skull had been ripped open. The three men whose bodies were still intact, or partly intact, had flesh and muscle excised from choice and meaty locations; no attempt had been made to consume bone marrow or any organs at all.

The state of the bodies contradicted Packer&#x27;s version of events. They were all together in one spot, not scattered across miles. Both Humphrey and Noon had large portions of remaining flesh, muscle and organs, that could have been consumed long before Bell attempted to murder Packer, as he had claimed. The men had tattered cloths lashed to their rotting feet, which had replaced the shoes they had probably eaten, and moldy and tattered blankets lay beneath and beside them. A beaten path went from the resting place of the corpses to a crude shelter that was used by Packer. Moreover, there was evidence to suggest that the deaths had occurred before supplies were totally exhausted. Within the shelter were possessions of the men which Packer had left behind. The theory at the time was that Packer killed the men before supplies ran out to rob them of their possessions, got snowed in, and then lived in his makeshift shelter for months, walking to his slain companions and slicing meat off as needed. Preston Nutter accompanied the party to the site, and identified the bodies as belonging to the five missing men. A rifle broken in two was found close to the bodies. Owing to the damage apparent on their remains, it is presumed that it was used to bludgeon one or more of them. Their remains were buried at the site by officials, and the search party returned to Packer&#x27;s makeshift jail to confront him, only to find him missing.

The jail he had been kept in was little more than a log cabin located on ranch property belonging to the Saguache County Sheriff. Months had passed with no definitive evidence of a crime having been committed, no bodies discovered, and no formal charges lodged against Packer — other than the attempt on Lauter&#x27;s life, which was not tenaciously sought for prosecution and was used more as a means to keep him under custody. Saguache County authorities were reportedly not happy about taxpayer dollars being spent so exorbitantly on keeping Packer housed and under constant guard. He was allegedly passed a makeshift key for his irons and given some supplies, and easily escaped. Even so, nearly the entirety of Saguache was convinced, either through rumor or rational deduction, that Packer was guilty of either robbery or murder. His life was threatened constantly by the nearby townspeople. Packer never divulged who helped him escape, how this was achieved, or why. It was presumed that his guard had been bribed by Packer himself or by someone else.

===Theories===

The generally accepted theory at the time was that Packer had attached himself to the party under highly overstated qualifications of being a mountain guide familiar with the area in order to accompany the men to Breckenridge, and had at best led his party to miserable deaths due to gross incompetence. This was enough of a crime in itself as far as the local population was concerned. However, an ultimately more popular theory was that he had set out with his party of five men from Ouray&#x27;s camp, with a premeditated plan to lead them into the wilderness where he would kill and rob them. Nutter and Loutsenhizer made it a personal mission to discredit Packer&#x27;s alleged qualifications for being a guide — let alone a mountain guide — and pointed out all of his character flaws that they had come to know, stressing his numerous different stories and inconsistencies. Local papers picked up the story and the incident received constant coverage, with highly sensational headlines, many negative comments regarding Packer&#x27;s character, and highly imagined theories that grabbed both national and international attention. Regardless as to how it may have happened, nearly the entire population of Saguache — and soon nearly the entire country and beyond — found that Packer&#x27;s culpability for his party&#x27;s deaths was beyond doubt.

The cannibalism aspect of his charges, although shocking, was not necessarily the foremost issue of his guilt. People at that time were well-acquainted with the story of the ill-fated Donner Party, who had resorted to cannibalism during the winter of 1846–1847, and were understanding to a degree of the dire need to eat in the unforgiving wilderness. Additionally cannibalism was and is not illegal per se in the United States, unless one commits murder in order to obtain the flesh to be consumed. Even in such a case, the accused would be charged with murder, with the cannibalism itself being charged as the desecration and/or abuse of a corpse. Packer would claim for the remainder of his life that he had been unjustly vilified and convicted for engaging in cannibalism rather than for cold-blooded murder, which he continued to deny ever having committed. In the end, it came down to the question: did the five men die due to incompetence, or greed?

==First trial==

On March 11, 1883, Packer was discovered by Jean &quot;Frenchy&quot; Cabazon in Cheyenne, Wyoming, living under the alias of &quot;John Schwartze&quot;, one of the original members of the Utah mining party who stayed in Chief Ouray&#x27;s camp in the winter of 1874. Cabazon was himself a member of the original party of men who left Provo, and wisely decided to stay put in Chief Ouray&#x27;s camp, later safely making his way to their destination with Bob McGrue and Preston Nutter&#x27;s party.

He encountered Packer by chance when Packer approached him looking to buy some supplies. Cabazon reported Packer to the local sheriff, who apprehended him and contacted General Adams. He was summoned to Cheyenne where he confirmed Packer&#x27;s identity and accompanied him by train to Denver for his second confession, which Packer signed on March 16. Packer stated that his main reason for fleeing was out of a fear of mob justice being exacted upon him by the populace of Saguache. Because the actual crime was committed within the confines of Hinsdale County, rather than neighboring Saguache County, Packer was accordingly sent to Lake City for detention and prosecution.

Instead of claiming that the men were gradually eaten as they died until Bell killed Noon and Packer in turn killed Bell in self-defense, Packer now claimed that Bell had killed the others after Bell had told him to go scouting for any way out of the mountains and to find some food. He had been gone the better part of the day and returned in the late evening. Packer told General Adams:

In the ensuing moments of shooting Bell and going for the hatchet, Packer dropped his revolver in the deep snow and subsequently lost it. He claimed he made himself a crude shelter out of stray logs to combat the snow and wind, aways down from the bodies. Another strong storm set in and he hunkered down for hours. He was starving and made the decision that he had to eat something or die. He continued:

Adams asked Packer why he had not told him this story nine years previous, with Packer replying: &quot;I was excited, I wanted to say something, and the story, as I told it, came first to my mind!&quot;

At the time of Packer&#x27;s trial, it was reported by the family of Israel Swan that he had left to go on the expedition with around $6,000 () in cash and gold, and that he also had a valuable Winchester rifle with him, which would give a strong motivation for murder, as well as his senior age of 65 at the time of his death. The other four members may have been either complicit in his murder and later betrayed by Packer, or were murdered by him for having been witnesses. Packer was not found with any gold on him at the time of his arrest, and although he did have money left, it did not total in the thousands. His spending had been frivolous.

Nevertheless, on April 6, a trial began in Lake City. It was the argument of the prosecution that the only logical reason for Packer to have attempted such a perilous journey through the mountains with such minimal food and supplies was for the sole purpose to lead the men into the wilderness to both kill and rob them. Packer pleaded not guilty. After seven days of testimonies and examinations, he was found guilty of the premeditated murder of Israel Swan, and sentenced to death by hanging, which was scheduled for May 19, 1883. It was presumed that Swan&#x27;s death had occurred on, or around, March 1. It was determined by the prosecution in court that Swan&#x27;s remains showed signs of a struggle at the time of death, and that the others appeared to be killed in their sleep. Among those who testified on behalf of the prosecution were Otto Mears, Larry Dolan, Oliver D. Loutsenhizer, and Preston Nutter, who acted as the prosecution&#x27;s key witness. According to a local newspaper, which received their quote from Larry Dolan, the presiding judge, M.B. Gerry, said:
 
Court records present Judge Gerry&#x27;s sentence as conventionally apolitical:

==Second trial==

Packer was spared the death penalty when his lawyers discovered that the murder statutes on the books for 1874 had been repealed and replaced with a &quot;savings clause&quot;, which spared him being tried for murder on a technicality. In October 1885, the sentence was reversed by the Colorado Supreme Court being based on an &quot;ex post facto&quot; law. They had declared that the government could not sentence a man to death for committing a crime, if it had indeed occurred, before Colorado officially became a state as opposed to a territory.

The overturning of his murder charge and scheduled execution did not spare Packer culpability for the men&#x27;s deaths, however. A second trial was held in Gunnison following a change of venue for his hearing that was also granted per the Colorado Supreme Court as well as having a new Judge of Republican Party standing to preside, pursuant to Packer and his Counsel feeling as though the prejudices and pre-affirmed guilt within the community of Lake City (most of them Democrats), made it impossible for him to receive a fair and unbiased trial. He again pleaded not guilty. After a swift trial and even speedier verdict deliberation, on June 8, 1886, Packer was convicted of five counts of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to 40 years in prison (8 years for each count, which was the maximum sentence allowed per count). At the time, this was the longest custodial sentence in U.S. history.

At the time of his second hearing, local hunters and officials made statements that although the winter of 1874 was one of the worst they had encountered for quite some time, the area of the San Juans where Packer and his party were camped was still plenty active with such large wild game as deer and antelope, as well as smaller game. There was even a report that the carcass of a deer was found near the campsite. This significantly damaged Packer&#x27;s claims that the area was so scant with wildlife that the men had to resort to cannibalism quickly. Further emphasis was placed on the fact that Packer&#x27;s choice to hike through the San Juan Mountains during the middle of winter, where snow depths can exceed more than six feet in a single downfall, coupled with blistering winds and freezing temperatures, was practically suicidal. He had been given a safe route to follow by locals that was next to a main water source that could have yielded fresh fish if nothing else as well as serve to keep them on course, but he perilously chose a mountain path with minimal supplies in the naive belief that it would be a faster route. In actuality, the route Packer and his companions took was nearly identical in length to the recommended route (though not in traverse), yet far more dangerous.

Packer took the stand in his own defense. His version of the events that took place at the campsite remained relatively the same as his second official version. He made a request that he be charged the 40 years, but only for the death of Shannon Bell, who is the only man that Packer continued to claim he had killed, with the other deaths being beyond his control. His request was denied. He was sent to serve out his sentence at the Canon City Penitentiary.

==Parole==

Packer filed appeals on his case on five separate occasions and was roundly denied upon every submission. He sent letters to local newspapers stating he had been unjustly convicted by an unfair and unsympathetic judicial system, and by the ignorant conclusions and judgments of small-minded people. On June 19, 1899, Packer&#x27;s sentence was officially upheld by the Colorado Supreme Court. Nevertheless, he was paroled on February 8, 1901, following a campaign that was initially spearheaded by an old acquaintance of Packer&#x27;s named Duane Hatch, who petitioned for his release for nearly a decade before his labors came to the attention of Polly Pry. Packer had served 18 years of his 40-year sentence.

An entrepreneurial and resourceful reporter for &quot;The Denver Post&quot;, Pry saw and appreciated the sensationalism of Packer&#x27;s case and how his story and pre-existing reputation could generate a buzz. She used Packer&#x27;s service in the Army as a basis to portray him as a common man of the people who got caught in a regrettable situation, a victim of circumstances who did what he had to do to survive, and a man who had essentially been crucified for violating civilized sensibilities by having to resort to cannibalism. Her stories on Packer led to a change of heart within the local businesses and people such that a series of petitions and requests made their way to the office of Colorado Governor Charles Thomas, which were still met with strong opposition. Thomas ultimately relented, and his last official act before leaving office was to parole, but not pardon, Packer under the agreement that he would not try to profit from his story.

After his parole, Packer went to work as a guard at &quot;The Denver Post&quot;, and later as a ranch hand. His employment at &quot;The Denver Post&quot; came about, many believe, as a direct result of Pry and her employers securing his release. Packer had an endearing respect for Pry for his remaining years, and referred to her as his &quot;Liberator&quot;.

==Death==

Alfred Packer died on April 23, 1907, aged 65, in Deer Creek, Jefferson County, Colorado. The cause of his death was cited as &quot;Dementia – trouble &amp; worry&quot;, although his clinical cause of death has been described as the result of a stroke. Packer is today widely rumored to have become a vegetarian before his death and was reported by those who knew him as a man rich with stories and well-liked by children. He lived modestly and was reported to be a charitable man.

===Remains===

Packer was interred in Littleton, Colorado. His grave is marked with a veteran&#x27;s tombstone listing his original regiment in 1862, which is a replacement, as his original grave marker was stolen. His first name is listed as Alfred; he is known to have gone by both &quot;Alfred&quot; and &quot;Alferd&quot; in life. He was never successful in getting an official state pardon for his crimes.

The Littleton Cemetery Association cemented over Packer&#x27;s grave in 1973 to deter grave robbing and vandalism. Despite their belief that his corpse is intact, claims have been made by Edward Meyer, the Vice-President of Exhibits and Archives for the Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! Museum, that they are in possession of Packer&#x27;s dissected skull, which they bought from an anonymous party for a reported sum of $20,000. No statement was made as to how they verified the authenticity of the skull, which is partially mummified, other than to state that the seller&#x27;s information regarding its origin was sufficient.

If the skull in question does belong to Packer, it is presumed that his head was removed from his body shortly before or after his burial, was then dissected with the brain being removed for study, and was then preserved through an arsenic curing process. It is then said to have fallen into the hands of a traveling sideshow, which displayed it, until it was later sold to a private party who in turn later sold it to Ripley&#x27;s. As of 2008, the skull is reported to be at the Ripley&#x27;s Museum in San Antonio, Texas, following its relocation from their New Orleans facility in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.

==Later investigations==

On July 17, 1989, 115 years after Packer consumed his companions, an exhumation of the five bodies was undertaken by James E. Starrs, then a professor of law specializing in forensic science at George Washington University, following an exhaustive search for the precise location of the remains around the area of Cannibal Plateau. The men&#x27;s remains were located at the end of a residential driveway of a home belonging to a local surgeon, and were buried only thirteen inches below ground level. Starrs and his colleague Walter H. Birkby concluded, regarding the cannibalism: &quot;I don&#x27;t think there will ever be any way to scientifically demonstrate cannibalism. Cannibalism per se is the ingestion of human flesh. So you&#x27;d have to have a picture of the guy actually eating.&quot; Packer never denied cannibalism, so this was not the men&#x27;s main intent for their investigation. The evidence uncovered was sufficient for Starrs to conclude that Packer had indeed murdered his comrades. Starrs came away with the belief that Packer more than likely murdered his companions for their belongings, and resorted to cannibalism out of necessity rather than intent. The men were re-interred and given a proper burial, complete with funeral rites being read.

Exhumation of the skeletal remains showed signs of what appeared to be blunt force trauma to the skulls of two of the men, with no other noteworthy disturbance to their skeletal remains aside from those made during their butchering. All skulls had damage to varying extents to their upper craniums, with fabric fibers being found within some of the skulls themselves, suggesting that their heads were possibly covered with a blanket at the time of their deaths. The three other skeletons showed defensive signs of hacking marks across the radial and ulna bones of their forearms (Shannon Bell being one), which one could sustain whilst shielding his face and body from an attack. Although Packer claimed that Bell had murdered the others with hatchet blows to the head, in his second version of the story, he never claimed that he had to fight off Bell with the hatchet in any rendition. In one version of his story, Bell had charged at Packer with Swan&#x27;s rifle, and Packer shot him. In Packer&#x27;s second official version of the story, he claimed he finished off Bell with a hatchet blow to the head, but that was the extent of his claim in regards to the hatchet. All five of the skeletons had numerous differing post-mortem injuries to them, including depressed fractures, butterfly fractures, butchering trauma, and hacking trauma, which seems to contradict Packer&#x27;s claims of &quot;minimal cannibalism&quot;.

Two skeletons aside from that of Shannon Bell were found to have cylindrical puncture wounds in the pelvic bone, which has led some to question if all three marks are the result of the scavenging marks of a bear, or even possibly bullet wounds. No definitive conclusions have been made to these discoveries.

This discovery suggested a scenario in which two of the men were bludgeoned in their sleep by Packer, the three remaining men awoke, and Packer shot them in the hips to incapacitate them (if the punctures are in fact bullet wounds). They then attempted to fight off Packer who was wielding a hatchet and he killed them all with blows to the head. He then butchered the men and used their flesh to survive in his snowbound state and during his journey. The differing states of decomposition of the bodies does contradict this theory, though it is plausible. It would seem unlikely that Packer had shot three of the five men in the hip, which is not by itself an outright kill shot, unless it was to debilitate them while he went in for the kill. Further analysis into the entry and exit geometry could be telling as to what their initial cause was, but no such examination has been done to date. His ultimate motivation for their murder has been debated heavily, and has several possible theories.

In 1994, David P. Bailey, Curator of History at the Museum of Western Colorado, undertook an investigation to turn up more conclusive results than Starrs&#x27; with respect to Packer&#x27;s claims of having shot Bell. In the Audrey Thrailkill collection of firearms owned by the museum was a Colt revolver that had reportedly been found at the site of Packer&#x27;s alleged crime. Exhaustive investigation into the pistol&#x27;s background turned up documents from the time of the trial: &quot;A Civil War veteran that visited the crime scene stated that Shannon Bell had been shot twice and the other victims were killed with a hatchet. Upon careful study of Bell, he noticed a severe bullet wound to the pelvic area and that Bell&#x27;s wallet had a bullet hole through it.&quot; This seems to corroborate Packer&#x27;s claim that Bell had killed the other victims and that Packer shot Bell in self-defense. By 2000, Bailey had not yet proven a link between the antique pistol and Alferd Packer, but he discovered that forensic samples from the 1989 exhumation had been archived, and analysis in 2001 with an electron microscope by Dr. Richard Dujay at Mesa State College found microscopic lead fragments in the soil taken from under Shannon Bell&#x27;s remains that were matched by spectrograph with the bullets remaining in what was indeed Packer&#x27;s pistol. While it appears certain that at least Bell was shot, the question of whether or not it was in self-defense remains unanswered.

==In popular culture==
===Books===

In Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s hardboiled detective novel &quot;The Thin Man&quot;, Nick Charles advises Gilbert Wynant to read a selection about Packer&#x27;s expeditions. The selection, from Thomas Samuel Duke&#x27;s &quot;Celebrated Criminal Cases of America&quot;, gives Packer&#x27;s first name as &quot;Alfred&quot;.

Packer is also the subject of &quot;Man-Eater&quot;, by American true-crime writer Harold Schechter. 

===Eateries and menus===

In 1968, students at the University of Colorado Boulder named their new cafeteria grill the &quot;Alferd G. Packer Memorial Grill&quot;, with the slogan, &quot;Have a friend for lunch!&quot; Students can order an &quot;El Canibal&quot; beefburger, and on the wall is a giant map outlining Packer&#x27;s travels through Colorado. It has since been renamed the Alferd Packer Restaurant &amp; Grill.

In 1977, the US Secretary of Agriculture, Bob Bergland, attempted to terminate a contract for the department&#x27;s cafeteria food service but was prevented by the General Services Administration (GSA). To embarrass the GSA, Bergland and his employees convened a press conference on August 10, 1977, to unveil a plaque naming the executive cafeteria &quot;The Alferd Packer Memorial Grill&quot;, announcing that Packer&#x27;s life exemplified the spirit and fare of the cafeteria and would &quot;serve all mankind&quot;. The event was covered on ABC-TV Evening News by Barbara Walters. The stratagem succeeded, and the contracts were terminated soon thereafter. Magnanimous in victory, Bergland yielded to the bureaucratic objection that the plaque lacked official GSA authorization and removed it. The plaque is currently displayed on the wall of the National Press Club&#x27;s &quot;The Reliable Source&quot; members-only bar. It doubles as a memorial to Stanley Weston (1931–84), a man who worked at the USDA. The Press Club&#x27;s hamburger is called the &quot;Alfred Packer Burger&quot;.

===Movies and music===

A biopic of Packer, &quot;The Legend of Alfred Packer&quot;, was released in 1980. In 1993, the comedy musical about Packer, &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot;, was released exclusively to Boulder, Colorado, and was released in the rest of the United States in 1996. It is also Trey Parker&#x27;s directoral debut.

Folk singer Phil Ochs wrote the song &quot;The Ballad of Alferd Packer&quot; (1964), documenting the events of the expedition and its aftermath. Ochs&#x27; use of humor in the song is typical of the seemingly lighthearted ongoing attitude toward Packer and his alleged crimes. Although the track never appeared on any of Ochs&#x27; studio or live album releases, it has appeared on several compilations issued since his death in 1976, most recently on the &quot;On My Way&quot; (2010) compilation of demos from 1963.

C. W. McCall wrote the song &quot;Comin&#x27; Back for More&quot; about Packer.

<doc id="289845" wikidata="Q144687" url="?curid=289845" title="Gene Robinson">
<text>Vicky Gene Robinson (born May 29, 1947) is a retired bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire. Robinson was elected bishop coadjutor in 2003 and succeeded as bishop diocesan in March 2004. Before becoming bishop, he served as Canon to the Ordinary for the Diocese of New Hampshire.

Robinson is widely known for being the first openly gay priest to be consecrated a bishop in a major Christian denomination believing in the historic episcopate, a matter of significant controversy. After his election, many theologically traditional Episcopalians in the United States abandoned the Episcopal Church, formed the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) and aligned themselves with bishops outside the Episcopal Church in the United States, a process called the Anglican realignment. His story has appeared in print and film.

In 2010, Robinson announced his intention to retire in 2013 at 65. His successor is A. Robert Hirschfeld.

==Early life==
Robinson&#x27;s parents were poor tenant farmers who worked in the tobacco fields as sharecroppers. The family used an outhouse, drew water from a cistern, and did laundry in a cast-iron tub over an open flame. Their house did not have running water until Robinson was ten years old. When Robinson was born, he was so seriously ill that the doctor was certain he would not survive. He was temporarily paralyzed from birth and his head was misshapen. So likely was Robinson&#x27;s death that the physician asked Robinson&#x27;s father Charles for a name for the baby&#x27;s birth and death certificates. Robinson&#x27;s parents were young (his mother Imogene was twenty) and they were hoping for a girl. They named the baby &quot;Vicky Gene Robinson&quot; for Charles&#x27; father Victor and the baby&#x27;s mother Imogene. For a long time, Robinson&#x27;s parents believed the boy would die soon. Much later in life, Robinson&#x27;s father would tell him he couldn&#x27;t take any joy in the boy&#x27;s development because he always thought each step was going to be the last thing. Robinson&#x27;s parents were members of a small Disciples of Christ congregation. Robinson describes his childhood as very religious. Robinson had perfect Sunday School attendance for thirteen years.

==Education and marriage==
Robinson chose the in Sewanee, Tennessee, in 1965 because they offered him a full scholarship. Robinson intended to study towards a medical degree but decided to major in American studies. During his college days, Robinson began to seriously consider the ordained ministry and said it almost immediately felt right. During high school and then college, Robinson had been exploring philosophical and theological questions and has said, &quot;The Episcopal Church got a hold on me.&quot; He graduated from Sewanee &quot;cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts degree in American studies in 1969 and attended seminary that fall. Robinson studied for a Master of Divinity degree from the Episcopal General Theological Seminary in New York City.

While doing an intern year as a chaplain at the University of Vermont, he began dating his future wife, Isabella &quot;Boo&quot; Martin. Robinson says that about &quot;a month into their relationship, [he] explained his background and his fears about his sexuality.&quot; They continued dating and, as Robinson puts it, &quot;about a month before the marriage, [he] became frightened that ... this thing would raise its ugly head some day, and cause her and me great pain.&quot; Robinson and Martin discussed it and decided to go ahead with the marriage in 1972.

==Early career and children==
Robinson received his degree in 1973 and was ordained a deacon in June 1973 at the cathedral of the diocese of Newark, New Jersey. He served as curate at Christ Church in Ridgewood, New Jersey, and was ordained a priest six months later. He and his wife remained at the Ridgewood parish for two years until June 1975. They then moved to New Hampshire, where Boo had grown up. Their goal was to start a business and ministry: In the winter it was called &quot;The Sign of the Dove Retreat Center&quot; and in the summer it became &quot;Pony Farm&quot;. Boo still runs &quot;Pony Farm&quot; as a horse camp for children.

In 1977, Robinson began working with a committee in the Diocese of New Hampshire to study human sexuality and co-authored a small manual on the subject. Robinson and Boo&#x27;s first daughter, Jamee, was born in 1977, followed by a second daughter, Ella, in 1981. Robinson treasures his marriage stating, &quot;[T]hat is inextricably tied up with having children. And since I cannot imagine my life without Jamee and Ella, it&#x27;s just a completely irrelevant question for me. And I don&#x27;t regret having been married to Boo, either, even if there had not been children. It&#x27;s just a part of my journey, and why would I possibly regret that?&quot;

==Coming out and career==
Robinson came out to his and Boo&#x27;s friends in 1986 and he sold his share in the business to Boo. They remained friends.

In November 1987, Robinson met his partner, Mark Andrew, while on vacation in St. Croix. Andrew worked in Washington, D.C., at the national office of the Peace Corps. On July 2, 1988, Robinson and Andrew moved into a new house in Weare, New Hampshire and had it blessed by Bishop Douglas E. Theuner, an event which they considered to be the formal recognition of their life together. The couple were legally joined in June 2008 in a private civil union ceremony in St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Concord. Earlier, Robinson had said, &quot;I always wanted to be a June bride.&quot; Robinson and Andrew divorced in 2014.

Robinson became Canon to the Ordinary in 1988, the executive assistant to the then bishop of New Hampshire, Douglas Theuner. Robinson remained in this job for the next seventeen years until he was elected bishop. 

Robinson and his daughters are very close. Ella helped her father with public relations at the General Convention in 2003. Just a week before, his daughter Jamee had given birth to his first granddaughter.

==Election as bishop==

Robinson was elected bishop by the New Hampshire diocese on June 7, 2003, at St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Concord. Thirty-nine clergy votes and 83 lay votes were the threshold necessary to elect a bishop in the Diocese of New Hampshire at that time. The clergy cast 58 votes for Robinson, and the laity voted 96 for Robinson on the second ballot. The Episcopal Church requires in its Canon 16 that the election procedure and the candidate who is elected be subjected to review and must be consented to by the national church. No objections were raised to the procedure of the election. If diocesan election occurred within 120 days (3 months) of a General Convention, canon law requires consent by the House of Deputies and then the House of Bishops at the General Convention itself. Consent to the election of Robinson was given in August at the 2003 General Convention. The General Convention of 2003 became the center for debate over Robinson&#x27;s election, as conservatives and liberals within the Church argued over whether Robinson should be allowed to become bishop. Some conservative factions threatened a schism within both the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion should Robinson be elected. Before the House of Deputies can vote on a resolution, a legislative committee must examine the piece of legislation first. The Committee on the Consecration of Bishops held a two-hour hearing on Robinson&#x27;s election and supporters and opponents were allowed to speak. One of the speakers was Robinson&#x27;s daughter, Ella, who read a letter from his ex-wife Boo in strong support of Robinson. The House of Deputies, which consists of laypersons and priests, voted in the affirmative: the laity voted 63 in favor, 32 opposed, and 13 divided; the clergy voted 65 in favor, 31 opposed, and 12 divided.
Robinson won the first two of three votes required for his election to be ratified, but allegations suddenly arose in August 2003 that Robinson had inappropriately touched a male parishioner and had connections with OutRight.org, which at the time carried a link to AllThingsBi.com, a resource site for bisexual people that included links to pornography sites. The final vote was postponed to address these last-minute charges. David W. Virtue, a critic of gay ordination, brought up the pornography allegation, claiming that: &quot;Gene Robinson&#x27;s website is linked by one click to 5,000 pornographic websites.&quot; When no such link was found on the Diocese of New Hampshire web page profiling the bishop-elect, Virtue stated that the link was on the website of an organization Robinson supported. Robinson was already known to be associated with Outright, a secular organization for the support of young LGBT people. Fred Barnes, a Fox News commentator, repeated the allegations on the website of &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;. On the day the allegations arose, the website issued a press release stating that it had removed the offending link, that it had been unaware of the pornographic links on allthingsbi.com, and that Robinson had no involvement with that particular chapter of Outright.

The male parishioner of Manchester, Vermont (in a diocese neighboring Robinson&#x27;s) who had alleged the &quot;touching&quot; was then reported to have said, during the investigating committee&#x27;s telephone call with him, that the acts in question were two separate occasions of what felt to him like intentionally seductive arm-squeezing and back-stroking, although in a public setting. The man acknowledged that others might have regarded the two incidents as &quot;natural&quot;, yet the incidents were disturbing to him nonetheless. The investigating committee&#x27;s report also stated that the man regretted having used the word &quot;harassment&quot; in his e-mail, and that the man declined an invitation to bring formal charges. After a two-day investigation, neither allegation proved of merit. The House of Bishops voted for Robinson in the affirmative, with 62 in favor, 43 opposed, and 2 abstaining.

==Consecration as bishop==

The election in New Hampshire, like all elections of bishops in the Episcopal Church, was done by a synodical election process, unlike many other parts of the Anglican Communion where bishops are appointed. This detail would be misunderstood when the international commentary following Robinson&#x27;s election suggested he should voluntarily step down or be asked to do so. The Jeffrey John case in the Church of England is the best example to contrast the election of bishops with the appointment of bishops. Jeffrey John is an openly gay priest living in a long-standing celibate relationship (he self-identifies as celibate) and was appointed as a bishop. One person alone, Richard Harries, then Bishop of Oxford, had the authority to appoint the Bishop of Reading (an area bishop in Oxford diocese), though new bishops are customarily consecrated by the archbishop. Rowan Williams, then Archbishop of Canterbury, however, allegedly persuaded Harries to not proceed with the appointment. This precedent would be used by the wider Anglican Communion to pressure Robinson. Robinson said that &quot;there was not a single bishop involved in the choosing of me to be Bishop of New Hampshire.&quot;

The Elections and Transitions Committee arranged for the Whittemore Center to be used for the consecration, a large hockey rink on the campus of the University of New Hampshire in Durham. The numbers expected were about 3,000 people, 300 press, a 200-strong choir, and 48 bishops. The security was strong: just as Barbara Harris had to wear a bullet-proof vest at her consecration, Robinson was showing his bullet-proof vest to Harris herself. Robinson&#x27;s parents, sister, daughter and their families and his ex-wife Boo were all at the consecration. Robinson was consecrated on November 2, 2003, in the presence of Frank Griswold, Presiding Bishop, and six co-consecrating bishops: 48 bishops in all.

Robinson&#x27;s election and consecration prompted a group of 19 bishops, led by Robert Duncan, Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, to make a statement warning the church of a possible schism between the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion. Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, stated that &quot;[it] will inevitably have a significant impact on the Anglican Communion throughout the world and it is too early to say what the result of that will be.&quot; He added: &quot;[I]t is my hope that the church in America and the rest of the Anglican Communion will have the opportunity to consider this development before significant and irrevocable decisions are made in response.&quot; Desmond Tutu, Archbishop &quot;emeritus&quot; of Cape Town, stated that he did not see what &quot;all the fuss&quot; was about, saying the election would not roil the Church of the Province of Southern Africa. Other senior bishops of the church, like Peter Akinola, Archbishop of the Church of Nigeria and head of the Global South, have made Robinson a figurehead in their dispute with the Episcopal Church. Some disaffected Episcopalians have disaffiliated from the Episcopal Church and formed the Convocation of Anglicans in North America with the support of the Nigerian church.

==Episcopate==

Reports from Britain describe how Robinson has received death threats, had to wear bulletproof vests, and needed protection since his election and consecration.

In February 2006, Robinson was treated at an inpatient rehabilitation facility to deal with his &quot;increasing dependence on alcohol&quot;. Diocesan officials were surprised by the news and asserted that they did not notice his alcoholism affect his ministry in any way. The Episcopal Church, through its General Convention, has long recognized alcoholism as a treatable human disease, not a failure of character or will. The members of the Standing Committee issued a statement fully supporting Robinson. He returned to work in March 2006.

Robinson was featured prominently in a documentary film entitled &quot;For the Bible Tells Me So&quot;, which screened at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival.

He has opposed the Roman Catholic ban on homosexual seminarians, stating: &quot;I find it so vile that they think they are going to end the child abuse scandal by throwing out homosexuals from seminaries.&quot;

Due to the controversy surrounding his consecration, Bishop Robinson was not invited to the 2008 Lambeth Conferences by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. A group of conservative bishops (including Akinola and Duncan) who opposed Robinson&#x27;s consecration gathered in Jerusalem one month prior to Lambeth 2008, at the Global Anglican Future Conference, an event which is perceived by some as schismatic.

Robinson did however visit the United Kingdom privately in July 2008, during which he participated in a film screening and question and answer session with Sir Ian McKellen at the Royal Festival Hall, and was invited to preach at St Mary&#x27;s Putney, events which attracted much media attention. The sermon was interrupted by a heckler who was then escorted out of the service. Robinson asked the rest of the congregation, most of whom greeted the interruption with slow-clapping, to &quot;pray for that man&quot;, before completing his sermon. The Primate of the Episcopal Church of the Sudan, Archbishop Daniel Deng Bul, on July 22 at a public press conference during the 2008 Lambeth Conference called for Robinson to resign, and for all those who had participated in his consecration to confess their sin to the conference.

In 2009 Robinson was selected to deliver the invocation at the kickoff event of President Barack Obama&#x27;s inaugural weekend. Despite his extended involvement with Obama during the campaign, his selection was widely discussed as an effort to counterbalance the role of the choice of evangelical pastor Rick Warren. Media outlets noted that Warren had compared the legitimization of same-sex marriage to the legalization of &quot;incest, polygamy or &#x27;an older guy marrying a child&#x27;&quot;. Warren also supported California Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in the state. However, Warren took a conciliatory tone towards Obama: &quot;I applaud his desire to be the president of every citizen.&quot; The kickoff event was held at the Lincoln Memorial two days before Obama&#x27;s swearing-in. It asked &quot;the God of our many understandings&quot; for seven blessings, and to help Obama, as president, in seven ways. Neither HBO&#x27;s exclusive live broadcast, nor the Presidential Inauguration Committee&#x27;s blog of the event included the invocation, but the prepared text was posted in full on the website of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire, and video shot informally by attendees was posted on YouTube. National Public Radio, which relied on the HBO feed that omitted it, broadcast a recording the following day with an interview of Robinson about its limited exposure; in that venue, Robinson described it as conforming to the four-fold Franciscan prayer model. According to the &quot;Washington Blade&quot;, it was the Presidential Inaugural Committee that made the decision for the prayer to be a part of the pre-show and not the show, itself, with a spokesman from that committee maintaining the prayer was dropped through an unspecified &quot;error.&quot; Some gay activists maintain that this was a slight on the part of the Obama administration.

In April 2009, Robinson made the &quot;Out&quot; magazine Third Annual Power 50 list of the most influential gay men and women in the US, landing at number 7. In August 2009, Gene Robinson was a key speaker at the 2009 Greenbelt Festival, held at Cheltenham Racecourse, Gloucestershire, England. Here he delivered three talks, each garnering an attendance in the thousands, based not only on his views of Christianity and homosexuality, but also on human sexuality in general and the rights of LGBT members of society. The three talks were entitled &quot;Homosexuality: What the Bible says &amp; why it matters&quot;, &quot;Keeping your cool in the eye of the storm&quot; and &quot;Sexuality and spirituality: keeping them together&quot;. As well as these three talks, Gene Robinson made a big impact on some gay and lesbian festival-goers by leading them collectively in prayer on the second night of the festival as part of a small group.

In 2009 he was given the Stephen F. Kolzak Media Award.

In 2012, Macky Alston premiered a documentary about Robinson, &quot;Love Free or Die: How the Bishop of New Hampshire is Changing the World&quot;, it was screened at Sundance Film Festival.

== Since retirement ==
After resigning as bishop of New Hampshire in 2013, Robinson moved to Washington, D.C. to join the Center for American Progress as a senior fellow and serve as bishop-in-residence at St. Thomas&#x27; Parish. In 2014, Robinson and his husband, Mark Andrew, divorced. 

From 2017 to 2021, Robinson served as Vice President and Senior Pastor of the Chautauqua Institution, a center for arts, education, recreation and religion in upstate New York.

<text>Harry Stewart Somers, CC (September 11, 1925 – March 9, 1999) was a contemporary Canadian composer.

Somers earned the unofficial title of &quot;Darling of Canadian Composition.&quot; He was a founding member of the Canadian League of Composers (CLC) and involved in the formation of other Canadian music organizations, including the Canada Council for the Arts and the Canadian Music Centre. He received commissions from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Canada Council for the Arts.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Somers was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on September 11, 1925. Somers did not become involved in formal musical study until he reached his teenage years in 1939 when he met a doctor and his wife—both pianists—who introduced him to classical works. Somers described this first encounter years later: &quot;A spark was ignited, and he became obsessed with music. Almost from that instant, he knew music would be his life, for better or for worse.&quot;

===Musical education===
14-year-old Somers began his study of piano after his first exposure under the tutelage of Dorothy Hornfelt, the neighborhood piano teacher. After two years of study with her, he was able to pass the Grade VIII examination at the Toronto Conservatory.

In 1942, Somers began studying under Reginald Godden at the conservatory, whom he stayed with until 1943. Godden later directed him to pursue formal studies under John Weinzweig. Weinzweig set up a program of traditional harmony study for him to study the 12-tone techniques. (Schoenberg had enforced similarly strict lessons in traditional harmony upon his own pupils, even as he encouraged them to explore dodecaphony.) Somers remained under Weinzweig&#x27;s instruction until 1949.

Somers took a sabbatical from his studies in 1943 to serve with the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. After WWII, Somers returned to the Royal Conservatory to continue his studies with Weinzweig with a new piano teacher, Weldon Kilburn. During this time, Somers was writing and performing his own works. Somers completed his studies at the conservatory in 1948 and then spent the summer in San Francisco studying piano under E. Robert Schmitz. His work was part of the music event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

In 1949, Somers started to focus on composition. In 1949, he was awarded a $2000 Canadian Amateur Hockey Association scholarship to spend a year in Paris studying composition with Darius Milhaud. Somers composed his suite for harp and orchestra in 1949. In Paris, Somers heard the music of Boulez and Messiaen; these composers would influence his later music.

===1950s and 1960s===
After his year with Darius Milhaud, Somers spent the 1950s devoted to composition. He earned his income as a music copyist. He composed his Symphony No.1 in 1951. In the 1950s, he improved his guitar skills. In the 1960s, he earned money of his commissions. He returned to Paris for more compositional studies with Canada Council for the Arts fellowship. While there, he concentrated on Gregorian chant, particularly its revival by the Solesmes Abbey. In 1963, he became a member of the John Adaskin Project, which was an in-school initiative. Also in 1963, Somers began his part-time career with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation by hosting televised youth concerts.

Somers&#x27;s first wife, Catherine Mackie, died in 1963.

In 1965, Somers began hosting the CBC radio series &quot;Music of Today&quot; and continued hosting it until 1969. He also became the special consultant of the North York School in Toronto from 1968 to 1969. In 1967, he remarried to the Canadian actress Barbara Chilcott. Also in 1967, he produced his best-known work, the opera &quot;Louis Riel&quot;, commissioned for Canada&#x27;s Centennial Year celebrations. In 1969, he received an $18,000 grant from the Canadian Cultural Institute in Rome. He spent two years there, during which time he wrote &quot;Voiceplay&quot; and &quot;Kyrie&quot;.

=== 1970s – 1990s ===

In 1971, after he returned to Canada from his work in Rome, Somers was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. He was awarded three honorary doctorates: one from the University of Ottawa (1975), one from York University (1975), and one from the University of Toronto (1976). In 1977, Somers made a visit to the USSR. While there, he gave lectures on Contemporary Canadian composition and spoke to other contemporary composers. During the 1980s, Somers received commissions for the Banff International String Quartet Competition, the Guelph Spring Festival, the S.C. Eckhardt-Gramatté Competition and the Canadian Opera Company.

In the 1990s, he composed two operas, &quot;Serinette&quot; to a libretto by James Reaney, and &quot;Mario the Magician&quot;, which was adapted from a story by Thomas Mann.

Somers also completed his music &quot;Third Piano Concerto&quot; in 1996. Somers gave the opening address at the Alberta Music Conference in 1993, wrote a choral piece for the 50th Anniversary of the United Nations in 1995, and served as the writer-in-residence for the first &quot;Word and Music Festival&quot; held at the University of Windsor in 1997. Canada honoured him in 1995 with tribute concerts given by the University of Ottawa and the National Arts Centre for his 70th birthday.

Somers died on March 9, 1999, in Toronto, Ontario.

==Styles==

Harry Somers had an eclectic approach. His music was performed in the US, Central and South Americas, Europe and the Soviet Union. His works include techniques such as vocalization, vowel and breath sounds, and timbrel inflections. The styles that are said to have influenced Somers the most are the music of Weinzweig, Bartók and Ives, Baroque counterpoint, serial technique and Gregorian chant.

Under Weinzweig, during the 1940s, Somers received his first formal instruction in composition. Prior to that point, he composed mainly in the style of the piano works he was playing. In 1950s, Somers focused on the use of fugue-related textures and techniques. Over half of the works written between 1950 and 1961 contain fugal movements. Some of his works feature &quot;sharp, nervous, rhythmic vitality, which often serves as a foil for slower-moving subsidiary melodic lines.&quot;

<doc id="289852" wikidata="Q237874" url="?curid=289852" title="Phichit province">
<text>Phichit (, , ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) lies in lower northern Thailand and 330 km due north of Bangkok. Neighbouring provinces are (from north clockwise) Phitsanulok, Phetchabun, Nakhon Sawan, and Kamphaeng Phet.

== Geography ==

The Nan and Yom Rivers flow through Phichit province, joining shortly before the Chao Phraya is formed. The province mainly consists of low fertile river plains, making rice and lotus the main crops. The total forest area is just or 0.4 percent of provincial area.

==History==
The town of Phichit was established in 1058 by Phraya Kotabongthevaraja (พระยาโคตระบอง), and was first part of the Sukhothai Kingdom, and later of Ayutthaya. An old temple in Pho Prathap Chang District is Wat Pho Prathap Chang (วัดโพธิ์ประทับช้าง). It was built by Phra Chao Suea, an Ayutthaya king, in 1701 at a site reputed to be his birthplace. The site is surrounded by double-walls and huge trees, some of which are over 200 years old.

The name of the main city changed several times. At first it was called &quot;Sa Luang&quot; (&#x27;city of the royal pond&#x27;). In Ayutthaya times it was called &quot;Okhaburi&quot; (&#x27;city in the swamp&#x27;), and then finally Phichit (&#x27;beautiful city&#x27;).

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows a pond, which refers to the old name of Phichit, &quot;Mueang Sa Luang&quot; (&#x27;city of the royal pond&#x27;). The banyan tree in front refers to Wat Pho Prathap Chang. The temple was built in 1669–1671 by King Luang Sorasak, who was born in the village of Pho Prathap Chang, between a banyan and a sacred fig.

The flag of Phichit shows the circular provincial seal in the middle. It has three green bars and two white horizontal bars, with the middle bar being interrupted by the seal.

The provincial tree is the ironwood. The provincial flower is the lotus. The provincial aquatic animal is the Siamese crocodile.

The provincial motto (loosely translated) states as follows:

:&quot;Hometown of Phra Chao Suea. The long boat racing festival. Superb amulets of Luang Pho Ngoen. Delightful Bueng Si Fai. Unified by Luang Pho Phet. Tasty Tha Khoi pomelos. Delicious and famed rice. The legend of Chalawan city.&quot;

== Health ==
The main hospital in Phichit is Phichit Hospital, operated by the Ministry of Public Health.

==Transport==
===Rail===
Phichit main station is Phichit railway station.
==Administrative divisions==

The province is divided into 12 districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). These are further divided into 89 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 852 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Phichit Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 28 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Phichit, Taphan Hin and Bang Mun Nak have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. There are a further 25 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 73 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations (SAO) (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="289853" wikidata="Q278268" url="?curid=289853" title="A.I. Love You">
<text>is a Japanese manga series by author Ken Akamatsu. The story follows Hitoshi Kōbe, a high school boy who is not good at anything but programming. He creates a program in particular named &quot;Program 30&quot; which is that of a female, and is shocked when she comes to life in the real world due to a lightning storm. Hitoshi names her &quot;Saati&quot; and teaches her about the real world, while she instructs him on how to properly have a girlfriend. Things get more complex however when two more of Hitoshi&#x27;s programs come to life, and a hacker goes after Saati&#x27;s program. &quot;A.I. Love You&quot; was first serialized through &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; in 1994, but later moved to &quot;Magazine Special&quot; where it ended in 1997. The series was collected into nine manga volumes that Kodansha also released between 1994 and 1997. Two re-releases followed; however, each time a volume was deducted.

In 2003, Tokyopop acquired the license to release the series in North America. The story&#x27;s title was changed but Tokyopop tried to keep a pun that had been used in the original Japanese title. Eight English language manga volumes were released between February 3, 2004, and April 12, 2005. The volumes were printed until 2009 when Tokyopop announced that the series would go out of print. The English adaptation was well received, and although reviewers pointed out that Akamatsu&#x27;s artwork was not at the professional level yet, they praised the story and characters.

==Plot==

The story centres on Hitoshi Kōbe, an average first-year in high school who fails miserably in academic, athletic and social situations.

Hitoshi has only one thing going for him: his ability to program computers. In fact, he is so good at this he has created programs that can rewrite themselves: Artificial intelligence, in other words. So far he has created thirty of these programs, and the latest—which he names &quot;Saati&quot; (the Japanese pronunciation of the English word &quot;thirty&quot;)—is so advanced that it can converse just like a real girl.

However, there is still the barrier of Hitoshi being in the physical world and Saati being a program, until one day a freak lightning strike materializes her into the real world, where she becomes Hitoshi&#x27;s girlfriend. The series then follows their now not so ordinary lives, as well as other A.I.s of Hitoshi&#x27;s creation as they attempt to keep Saati&#x27;s secret while she adapts to the lifestyle of humans.

==Release==
&quot;A.I. Love You&quot; was serialized through manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; in 1994 starting in the 18th issue, and going until Issue 40. Publisher Kodansha then switched the manga to &quot;Magazine Special&quot; where the series ended in 1997. The chapters were collected into nine &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes between September 16, 1994 and October 17, 1997. The series was subsequently re-released by Kodansha through KC Deluxe from November, 1999 to June, 2000 this time though with eight volumes. The final re-release took place between November 17, 2004, and June 17, 2005 again by Kodansha, but with seven volumes.

In June 2003, &quot;A.I. Love You&quot; showed up on Tokyopop&#x27;s website but was removed shortly after. Tokyopop announced a month later though at Anime Expo 2003 that it had officially licensed the series for an English language release in North America. The first volume released came out on February 3, 2004, altogether eight volumes were released. Tokyopop released the final volume on April 12, 2005, and continued printing the series up until August 31, 2009 when it was announced that all eight volumes would be out of print. Although discontinued, the company offered returns for those who desired up until March 1, 2010. The discontinuation was a result of Kodansha letting its licenses expire with Tokyopop which led to the removal of some of company&#x27;s biggest titles.

==Naming==
The original Japanese title, &quot;A・I&quot; が止まらない! (&quot;A.I. ga Tomaranai!&quot;), is a play on words. While it roughly means &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Love&quot; the word &quot;A.I.&quot; has several meanings. Besides being the acronym for artificial intelligence, it is also the Japanese word for and the Japanese transcription of the English word . Tokyopop does their best to recreate this pun with their US release of the series in which this case they added &quot;Love You&quot; to create a pun referring to the statement &quot;I Love You&quot; in A.(I. Love You).

==Reception==
The English language adaptation of the manga series has received reviews from various media outlets that provide feedback, and reception in regards to manga. Samantha from Manga Life gave the first book an A rating calling it a &quot;very deep series&quot;. When talking about the characters she says that they all have bright personalities, and are overall loveable. Allen Divers from Anime News Network also gave the first volume a review calling the story predictable. Allen goes on to say though that the simple love story aside from the fan service &quot;can keep the ladies happy as well&quot;. In his review of the first volume, Mike Dungan from Mania.com called the story &quot;amateurish&quot; saying that they have predictable plots to them. Mike praises the English release though for being far better when it comes to the artwork, and design than the original Japanese release. He finishes his review saying that while the artwork is not yet at the &quot;Love Hina&quot; level (this was Akamatsu&#x27;s first manga), Ken&#x27;s fans &quot;won&#x27;t want to do without it&quot; citing the evolution of Akamatsu&#x27;s artwork.

<text>The study of alignments of random points in a plane seeks to discover subsets of points that occupy an approximately straight line within a larger set of points that are randomly placed in a planar region.
Studies have shown that such near-alignments occur by chance with greater frequency than one might intuitively expect.

This has been put forward as a demonstration that ley lines and other similar mysterious alignments believed by some to be phenomena of deep significance might exist solely due to chance alone, as opposed to the supernatural or anthropological explanations put forward by their proponents. The topic has also been studied in the fields of computer vision and astronomy.

A number of studies have examined the mathematics of alignment of random points on the plane. In all of these, the width of the line — the allowed displacement of the positions of the points from a perfect straight line — is important. It allows the fact that real-world features are not mathematical points, and that their positions need not line up exactly for them to be considered in alignment. Alfred Watkins, in his classic work on ley lines &quot;The Old Straight Track&quot;, used the width of a pencil line on a map as the threshold for the tolerance of what might be regarded as an alignment. For example, using a 1 mm pencil line to draw alignments on a 1:50,000 scale Ordnance Survey map, the corresponding width on the ground would be 50 m.

== Estimate of probability of chance alignments ==
Contrary to intuition, finding alignments between randomly placed points on a landscape gets progressively easier as the geographic area to be considered increases. One way of understanding this phenomenon is to see that the increase in the number of possible combinations of sets of points in that area overwhelms the decrease in the probability that any given set of points in that area line up.

One definition which expresses the generally accepted meaning of &quot;alignment&quot; is:
More precisely, a path of width &quot;w&quot; may be defined as the set of all points within a distance of &quot;w/2&quot; of a straight line on a plane, or a great circle on a sphere, or in general any geodesic on any other kind of manifold. Note that, in general, any given set of points that are aligned in this way will contain a large number of infinitesimally different straight paths. Therefore, only the existence of at least one straight path is necessary to determine whether a set of points is an alignment. For this reason, it is easier to count the sets of points, rather than the paths themselves. The number of alignments found is very sensitive to the allowed width &quot;w&quot;, increasing approximately proportionately to &quot;w&quot;&quot;k&quot;−2, where &quot;k&quot; is the number of points in an alignment.

The following is a very approximate order-of-magnitude estimate of the likelihood of alignments, assuming a plane covered with uniformly distributed &quot;significant&quot; points.

Consider a set of &quot;n&quot; points in a compact area with approximate diameter &quot;L&quot; and area approximately &quot;L&quot;2. Consider a valid line to be one where every point is within distance &quot;w&quot;/2 of the line (that is, lies on a track of width &quot;w&quot;, where &quot;w&quot; ≪ &quot;L&quot;).

Consider all the unordered sets of &quot;k&quot; points from the &quot;n&quot; points, of which there are:

:formula_1

(see factorial and binomial coefficient for notation).

To make a rough estimate of the probability that any given subset of &quot;k&quot; points is approximately collinear in the way defined above, consider the line between the &quot;leftmost&quot; and &quot;rightmost&quot; two points in that subset (for some arbitrary left/right axis: the top and bottom can be chosen for the exceptional vertical case). A straight line can trivially be drawn through those two points. For each of the remaining &quot;k&quot;-2 points in the subset, the probability that the point is &quot;near enough&quot; to the line is roughly &quot;w&quot;/&quot;L&quot;, which can be seen by considering the ratio of the area of the line tolerance zone (roughly &quot;wL&quot;) and the overall area (roughly &quot;L&quot;2).

So, based on the approximate estimates above, the expected number of k-point alignments in the overall set can be estimated to be very roughly equal to

:formula_2

Among other things this can be used to show that, contrary to intuition, the number of &quot;k&quot;-point lines expected from random chance in a plane covered with points at a given density, for a given line width, increases much more than linearly with the size of the area considered, since the combinatorial explosion of growth in the number of possible combinations of points more than makes up for the increase in difficulty of any given combination lining up.

== More precise estimate of expected number of alignments ==
Using a similar, but more careful analysis, a more precise expression for the number of 3-point alignments of maximum width &quot;w&quot; and maximum length &quot;d&quot; expected by chance among &quot;n&quot; points placed randomly on a square of side &quot;L&quot; can be found as 
:formula_3

If &quot;d&quot; ≈ &quot;L&quot; and &quot;k&quot; = 3, it can be seen that this makes the same prediction as the rough estimate above, up to a constant factor.

If edge effects (alignments lost over the boundaries of the square) are included, then the expression becomes
:formula_4

A generalisation to &quot;k&quot;-point alignments (ignoring edge effects) is
:formula_5
which has roughly similar asymptotic scaling properties as the crude approximation in the previous section, for the same reason; that combinatorial explosion for large &quot;n&quot; overwhelms the effects of other variables.

== Computer simulation of alignments ==

Computer simulations show that points on a plane tend to form alignments similar to those found by ley hunters in numbers consistent with the order-of-magnitude estimates above, suggesting that ley lines may also be generated by chance. This phenomenon occurs regardless of whether the points are generated pseudo-randomly by computer, or from data sets of mundane features such as pizza restaurants or telephone booths.

On a map with a width of tens of kilometers, it is easy to find alignments of 4 to 8 points even in relatively small sets of features with &quot;w&quot; = 50 m. Choosing larger areas, denser sets of features, or larger values of &quot;w&quot; makes it easy to find alignments of 20 or more points.

<text>Social organisms, including human(s), live collectively in interacting populations. This interaction is considered social whether they are aware of it or not, and whether the exchange is voluntary or not.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;social&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;socii&quot; (&quot;allies&quot;). It is particularly derived from the Italian &quot;Socii&quot; states, historical allies of the Roman Republic (although they rebelled against Rome in the Social War of 91–87 BC).

==Social theorists==
In the view of Karl Marx, human beings are intrinsically, necessarily and by definition social beings who, beyond being &quot;gregarious creatures&quot;, cannot survive and meet their needs other than through social co-operation and association. Their social characteristics are therefore to a large extent an objectively given fact, stamped on them from birth and affirmed by socialization processes; and, according to Marx, in producing and reproducing their material life, people must necessarily enter into relations of production which are &quot;independent of their will&quot;.

By contrast, the sociologist Max Weber for example defines human action as &quot;social&quot; if, by virtue of the subjective meanings attached to the action by individuals, it &quot;takes account of the behavior of others, and is thereby oriented in its course&quot;.

==In socialism==
The term &quot;socialism&quot;, used from the 1830s onwards in France and the United Kingdom, was directly related to what was called the social question. In essence, early socialists contended that the emergence of competitive market economies did not create &quot;liberty, equality and fraternity&quot; for all citizens, requiring the intervention of politics and social reform to tackle social problems, injustices and grievances (a topic on which Jean-Jacques Rousseau discourses at length in his classic work &quot;The Social Contract&quot;). Originally the term &quot;socialist&quot; was often used interchangeably with &quot;co-operative&quot;, &quot;mutualist&quot;, &quot;associationist&quot; and &quot;collectivist&quot; in reference to the organization of economic enterprise socialists advocated, in contrast to the private enterprise and corporate organizational structures inherent to capitalism.

The modern concept of socialism evolved in response to the development of industrial capitalism. The &quot;social&quot; in modern &quot;socialism&quot; came to refer to the specific perspective and understanding socialists had of the development of material, economic forces and determinants of human behavior in society. Specifically, it denoted the perspective that human behavior is largely determined by a person&#x27;s immediate social environment, that modes of social organization were not supernatural or metaphysical constructs but products of the social system and social environment, which were in turn products of the level of technology/mode of production (the material world), and were therefore constantly changing. Social and economic systems were thus not the product of innate human nature, but of the underlying form of economic organization and level of technology in a given society, implying that human social relations and incentive-structures would also change as social relations and social organization changes in response to improvements in technology and evolving material forces (relations of production). This perspective formed the bulk of the foundation for Karl Marx&#x27;s materialist conception of history.

==Modern uses==

In contemporary society, &quot;social&quot; often refers to the redistributive policies of the government which aim to apply resources in the public interest, for example, social security. Policy concerns then include the problems of social exclusion and social cohesion. Here, &quot;social&quot; contrasts with &quot;private&quot; and to the distinction between the public and the private spheres, where ownership relations define access to resources and attention.

The social domain is often also contrasted with that of physical nature, but in sociobiology analogies are drawn between humans and other living species in order to explain social behavior in terms of biological factors.

<doc id="289864" wikidata="Q5680135" url="?curid=289864" title="King Follett discourse">
<text>The King Follett discourse, or King Follett sermon, was an address delivered in Nauvoo, Illinois, by Joseph Smith, president and founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, on April 7, 1844, less than three months before he was killed by a mob. The discourse was presented to a congregation of about twenty thousand Latter Day Saints at a general conference held shortly after the funeral service of Elder King Follett, who had died on March 9, 1844, of accidental injuries. The sermon is notable for its assertion that God was once a mortal man, and that mortal men and women can become gods (a concept commonly called divinization) through salvation and exaltation. These topics were, and are, controversial, and have received varying opinions and interpretations of what Smith meant. Literary critic Harold Bloom called the sermon &quot;one of the truly remarkable sermons ever preached in America.&quot;

==Text==

A full, verbatim account of the speech does not exist, but notes exist, taken contemporaneously, by Thomas Bullock (using a type of personal shorthand), William Clayton (writing in longhand), and Willard Richards (taking &quot;minute&quot;-style notes of major elements of the speech). Wilford Woodruff also took extensive contemporaneous notes and transferred the notes to his journal with editorializations, but his original notes were not preserved. One author (Searle) estimates that the surviving notes of the sermon contain roughly 30% of the words of the actual address, but that together, they are likely nearly topically complete.

A version reconstructed (by Bullock) from the Bullock and Clayton records was published in the church paper &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; of August 15, 1844. A later version resulted from amalgamation of the Richards, Woodruff, Bullock and Clayton texts. This amalgamation was done by church employee, Jonathan Grimshaw, roughly ten years after Smith&#x27;s death and is generally regarded as the &quot;official&quot; version of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) because it was carefully reviewed, edited, and approved by church authorities, including Brigham Young. It contains some text not found in any of the primary sources and contains redundancies resulting from the naïve reconstruction. These redundancies, and the parts added by Grimshaw without support in the contemporaneous notes, were removed in a modern amalgamation by Stan Larson in 1978.

==Significance in Latter-day Saint theology==
The sermon was not always viewed in a favorable light by leaders of the LDS Church or other denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement. It was not published in the LDS Church&#x27;s 1912 &quot;History of the Church&quot; because of then-church president Joseph F. Smith&#x27;s discomfort with some ideas in the sermon popularized by the editor of the project, B. H. Roberts of the First Council of the Seventy. By 1950, it was included in the revised edition of &quot;History of the Church&quot;. In 1971, the sermon was published in the &quot;Ensign&quot;, an official publication of the LDS Church.

The ideas of the King Follett sermon were a precursor to the Adam–God doctrine taught by Brigham Young, second president of the LDS Church. According to this doctrine, Adam was once a mortal man who became resurrected and exalted, followed by creating the Earth and again becoming a mortal being in the Garden of Eden before returning to heaven and to serving as the God of humankind. However, soon after Young died, the Adam–God doctrine fell out of favor within the LDS Church and was replaced by a more traditional biblical Adam and Eve theology. In 1976, church president Spencer W. Kimball stated the LDS Church does not support the Adam–God doctrine.

LDS Church president Lorenzo Snow succinctly summarized a portion of the doctrine explained in this discourse using a couplet, which is often repeated within the church: 

The LDS Church today teaches that the King Follett discourse was &quot;the most direct, public explanation&quot; of unique doctrines, such as that of humanity&#x27;s premortal existence and divine potential, that are alluded to in Latter Day Saint scripture. However, with respect to the nature of God prior to creation, the church has stated that &quot;Little has been revealed ... and consequently little is taught.&quot;

==Topics==
Doctrinal topics in the sermon include:
* the fundamental nature of reality —
:man is not a contingent being, moreover God made the world from preexisting &quot;chaotic matter.&quot;
:&quot;I take my ring from my finger and liken it unto the mind of man ... because it has no beginning&quot;
:&quot;The pure principles of element, are principles that can never be destroyed.&quot;
* the character and nature of God —
:&quot;&quot;It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the Character of God, and to know that we may converse with him as one man converses with another.&quot;
:&quot;God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens! That is the great secret. If the veil were rent today, and ... God ... (were) to make himself visible ... if you were to see him today, you would see him like a man in form — like yourselves in all the person, image, and the very form as a man.&quot;
* Humanity’s potential to become Gods themselves. —
:Smith discussed the potential of mankind by referencing Romans , then stating that men may go: &quot;...from one small degree to another, and from a small capacity to a great one; from grace to grace, from exaltation to exaltation ... until (they) arrive at the station of a God.&quot;

* the tie between the living and their progenitors —
:&quot;Is there nothing to be done? — no preparation — no salvation for our fathers and friends who have died without having had the opportunity to obey the decrees of the Son of Man?&quot;
:&quot;God hath made a provision that every spirit in the eternal world can be ... saved unless he has committed (the) unpardonable sin.&quot;

Regarding his personal religious experiences, Smith stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t blame anyone for not believing my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I could not have believed it myself.&quot;&quot; Concerned with difficulties facing the church and threats on his own life, he closed the two-hour-and-fifteen-minute address with a plea for peace and invoked God&#x27;s blessing on the assembled Latter Day Saints.

Although the discourse is considered by Mormons to be one of the most important given by Smith on the nature of God and exaltation, it is not part of the LDS Church&#x27;s canonized scriptures. 

The topics in the discourse were not new to Smith&#x27;s preaching. Nearly all the subjects treated were continuing threads from earlier sermons. However, this discourse brought these ideas together in one connected narrative, and has had much wider distribution than most of the rest of his public utterances.

<doc id="289874" wikidata="Q2264782" url="?curid=289874" title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater">
<text>Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater, released as Tony Hawk&#x27;s Skateboarding in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Europe, is a 1999 skateboarding video game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision. It is the first installment in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; series. It was released for the PlayStation on September 29, 1999 and was later ported to the Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, Dreamcast, and N-Gage.

&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; takes place in an urban environment permeated by an ambience of punk rock and ska punk music. The player takes control of a variety of skateboarders and must complete missions by performing skateboarding tricks and collecting objects. The game offers several modes of gameplay, including a career mode in which the player must complete objectives and evolve their character&#x27;s attributes, a single session, in which the player accumulates a high score within two minutes, a free skate mode in which the player may skate without any given objective, and a multiplayer mode that features a number of competitive games.

&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; was met with critical acclaim for all versions except the Game Boy Color version, which had a more mixed reception. The game resulted in a successful franchise, receiving eight annualized sequels developed by Neversoft from &quot;Pro Skater 2&quot; (2000) to &quot;Proving Ground&quot; (2007). It is also credited with introducing skateboarding to a more mainstream global audience. It received a remake along with the sequel, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2&quot;, in 2020.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; puts the player in control of a skateboarder and takes place in a third-person view with a fixed camera. The goal of the game is to perform tricks and combinations thereof in an effort to increase the player&#x27;s score. Movement can be altered using the d-pad or analog stick, and ollies, grabs, flips and grinds are each assigned to individual buttons. Each skateboarder has eight grabs, eight grinds and eight flips. The number of points earned from a successful trick sequence is dependent on the amount of time spent in the air, the degree of rotation, and the number and variety of tricks performed; the more a single trick is performed in a sequence, the fewer points it will earn. When the player succeeds in performing tricks, a special gauge increases. When this gauge is full and flashing, the player is capable of performing a special trick that is worth many more points than ordinary tricks. If the player bails (falls off their skateboard), any points that may have been earned from the current combo are lost, and the special gauge is emptied.

In the game&#x27;s &quot;Career Mode&quot;, the player must complete five objectives (represented by VHS tapes) in each level within a period of two minutes. The player is not obligated to complete all the objectives within a single run; any completed objective is committed to the game&#x27;s memory, which allows other objectives to be completed within multiple playthroughs of a level. Two common objectives in each level are achieved by accumulating two defined scores, which gradually increases in difficulty throughout the game; while one other common objective is to collect letters of the word &quot;SKATE&quot;. Another common objective is to destroy five of a certain object within each level. The fifth objective involves collecting a VHS tape hidden in the level. Completing objectives unlocks additional levels and equipment for use. Three of the mode&#x27;s levels take place in a competition setting in which the player performs for judges and accumulates the highest score within three one-minute rounds. The player receives a bronze, silver or gold medal depending on the final score they are given. Other single-player modes include the &quot;Single Session&quot;, in which the player can freely accumulate a high score within two minutes using any previously obtained levels and characters, and the &quot;Free Skate&quot;, in which there is no time limit imposed.

The multiplayer mode is played by two players in a split screen view and offers three games: &quot;Graffiti&quot;, &quot;Trick Attack&quot;, and &quot;HORSE&quot;. In &quot;Graffiti&quot;, players must accumulate the highest score by changing level elements into their own color via the use of tricks. If a player performs a higher-scoring trick on an element that has already been marked, the element will change to that player&#x27;s color. &quot;Trick Attack&quot; is a mode in which players must accumulate the highest score by chaining tricks together. &quot;HORSE&quot; is a game that is played intermittently between two players, who must compete in rounds lasting either eight seconds or until a trick has been made. The player with the lower score on any given turn receives a letter in the word &quot;HORSE&quot; or whatever word the players have generated prior to the game&#x27;s start. The first player to accumulate the entire word loses.

===Featured pro skaters===
The game features a total of ten real life professional skateboarders, along with two unlockable original characters: Officer Dick and Private Carrera.
==Development==
Following the releases of arcade game &quot;Top Skater&quot; (1997) by Sega and PlayStation game &quot;Street Sk8er&quot; (1998) by Electronic Arts, Activision identified skateboarding-simulation games as a growing market in the gaming industry and concluded that such a title would resonate with a young audience. Preceding Neversoft&#x27;s involvement in the project, the task of developing a skateboarding title for Activision was given to another studio. However, this studio&#x27;s attempt did not impress Activision and didn&#x27;t move past the concept stage. The publisher then decided to entrust the project to Neversoft, which had recently completed the third-person shooter game &quot;Apocalypse&quot; (1998) within nine months. Although Neversoft had never developed a sports video game before, the development team was confident in its ability to accomplish the task before its given deadline of the 1999 Christmas season.

During development, the Neversoft team would spend its lunch breaks at a bowling alley near the studio, where they would play and subsequently study from Sega&#x27;s &quot;Top Skater&quot; in the arcade. The game&#x27;s design served as a strong basic influence, along with observances of real skaters performing in the X Games, which were taking place during the game&#x27;s development. Although the team decided early on that &quot;Top Skater&quot;″s linearity lacked the sense of fun they aimed for, the &quot;racetrack&quot; element was retained in two of the game&#x27;s final levels. Contrary to subsequent titles in the series, Neversoft did not primarily focus on using pre-existing locations as reference for the game&#x27;s level design, but simply envisioned potential skating areas such as a school or a city and incorporated elements such as ramps and rails to benefit the gameplay. The team consciously prioritized fun over realism in the approach to the game&#x27;s level design and physics.

The game&#x27;s engine is a modified version of that of Neversoft&#x27;s previous title &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, and the game&#x27;s prototype used Bruce Willis&#x27;s character from that game as the placeholder player character. Once the prototype reached a functional and demonstrable state, the Neversoft team realized that they would require a professional skateboarder to aid in the remainder of production. At the time, Tony Hawk had been a popular figure within skateboarding for quite some time. In September 1998, Activision established contact with Hawk and arranged a meeting between him and Neversoft. Hawk was quickly impressed by the design team members&#x27; devotion to skateboarding, the controls and engine of their game&#x27;s early build and agreed to lend his name and involvement to the production. Subsequently, Hawk would turn down Activision&#x27;s offer of a one-time buyout for the permanent use of his name and likeness on the game in favor of a royalty deal in which Hawk would earn a percentage for every copy sold. As a result of the series&#x27; eventual success, Hawk would earn ten times Activision&#x27;s initial offer within two years. By January 1999, Activision publicly announced their agreement with Hawk to include him in the game. Activision senior vice president Mitch Lasky, in an interview with GameSpot, stated that the character was meant &quot;to reflect Tony&#x27;s signature style – an intense mix of acrobatics and hard-core technical skating&quot;. Hawk remarked that &quot;[he had] always wanted to help create a video game that represented the reality and excitement of professional skateboarding&quot;.

Hawk would spend the development time periodically playing through the game&#x27;s beta builds and providing feedback, using a specially modified PlayStation console that can play games burned on CD-Rs. Hawk even went so far as to purposely send advanced copies of the game to a trusted group of people who also owned modchipped PlayStations: &quot;I had a modified PlayStation so I could use burned discs, and they&#x27;d send me new developments and we&#x27;d go back and forth. I&#x27;d let people play it, people that I trust. At one point, I felt it was getting so far along that I started to sneak out copies for those same people - these people had modded PlayStations. As subversive as that was, it started to create a buzz in the industry, because they were key players in the skating industry and they were also hardcore gamers&quot;. He would also personally select a group of other professional skaters to include as playable characters based on their skills, personalities and diversity; each skater received a cut of the royalties and got to select their own attire and special tricks for the game. While animating the skaters, the design team largely depended on using available video footage as reference. The incorporation of motion capture was attempted to aid in the realism of the animation, but due to the technology&#x27;s infancy, the result was ultimately determined to have not translated as well as what had already been animated. The 900 featured in the game was itself drawn from footage of Hawk&#x27;s famed performance of the feat in the X Games that summer, and was a relatively late addition as a result.

The collection of VHS tapes was directly inspired by the collection of stars in &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; (1996). In designing the objectives, the team would gather at a table, draw a level and then ask what could be done within said level, upon which the team members would provide ideas. Rejected concepts arising from these sessions include levels taking place on a highway and a jetty, and a scenario in which the player would lose a wheel and have to skate on three wheels. Manuals were originally intended to be implemented into the game, but were omitted due to time constraints; manuals would subsequently be included in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot;.

===Promotion and release===
Elissa Steamer&#x27;s inclusion in the game, along with the game&#x27;s final release date of September 29, was presented on August 26, 1999. A playable demo with only two available skaters was integrated into the Jampack Summer &#x27;99 compilation CD released by &quot;PlayStation Underground&quot;. The game was made available for pre-order two weeks prior to the game&#x27;s release; those who pre-ordered the game at Electronics Boutique or FuncoLand respectively received a miniature replica of Tony Hawk&#x27;s Birdhouse skateboard, a sticker sheet featuring the game&#x27;s ten professional skaters and a game tip on the back of each sticker. A second playable demo was included on a promotional compilation disc released by Pizza Hut on November 14.

While Neversoft would begin development of the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot;, shortly before the release of the first game, Activision would entrust the game&#x27;s Nintendo 64 port to Edge of Reality, which had recently ported &quot;Monster Truck Madness 2&quot; to the same system. The Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color versions received a multi-million dollar advertising campaign on several major youth-targeted channels in the United States beginning in April 2000. Customers who purchased the Game Boy Color version at Toys &quot;R&quot; Us or FuncoLand received a special-edition miniature skateboard.

As a result of the disappointing sales of &quot;Blue Stinger&quot;, Activision was discouraged from publishing further titles for the Dreamcast and relinquished the distribution of &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; on the console to Crave Entertainment. After online speculation and teasing comments from company insiders, a port for the Dreamcast was revealed to be developed by Treyarch. Later in 2003, the N-Gage version was in development. The game came bundled with the N-Gage QD that was released in 2004.

==Ports==
The Nintendo 64 port of &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; was developed by Edge of Reality and released on March 15, 2000. While the port is largely faithful to the original version and retains all game modes, characters and levels, the soundtrack had been truncated and the voices were removed to accommodate the lessened space in the cartridge format. The blood effects had also been removed, so Nintendo could market the game with an &quot;E&quot; game rating. The Dreamcast version was developed by Treyarch, published by Crave Entertainment and released on May 24, 2000. The graphics and animations in the Dreamcast version are improved from those in the PlayStation version.
The Game Boy Color version was developed by the Japanese company Natsume and released on March 30, 2000. The Game Boy Color version is an adaptation rather than a true port of the PlayStation version due to the limited capacity of the platform. The game offers two different gameplay styles: an overhead view with vertical scrolling, and a side-scrolling view in which there is a ramp on each side. There are four gameplay modes in which the player can only perform a few tricks. In &quot;Half Pipe Mode&quot;, the player must attempt to achieve the highest score possible. &quot;Tournament Mode&quot; is a five-level vertically scrolling game in which the player must race against three computer-controlled skaters and achieve the highest rank. Jumps are made automatically when the player maneuvers onto ramps, and tricks are displayed as a brief static image. &quot;Versus Mode&quot; and &quot;Rival Mode&quot; are identical to &quot;Tournament Mode&quot;, except the player plays in a single level against a single opponent; the opponent in &quot;Rival Mode&quot; is computer-controlled, while the opponent in &quot;Versus Mode&quot; is human, which necessitates the use of a Game Link Cable.

The N-Gage version was developed by Ideaworks3D and released on October 13, 2003, a week following the launch of the N-Gage. The game is a faithful port of the PlayStation version and retains most of the characters, levels, control scheme and original music while adding levels from &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; and two multiplayer games. The game&#x27;s multiplayer functions via the N-Gage&#x27;s Bluetooth feature. The N-Gage version was named &quot;Best-Mobile Game&quot; by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2004.

A remake of both the first game and &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot;, titled &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2&quot;, was developed by Vicarious Visions and released on September 4, 2020, for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One, followed up a year later on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch. The remake includes all of the original levels and skaters from the original games, but also includes improved skater creation and park creation modes, online multiplayer, and other new features, and featuring most of the original soundtracks, with a few exceptions due to licensing issues.

==Reception==
&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; was met with critical acclaim. Doug Perry of &quot;IGN&quot; praised the game&#x27;s &quot;imaginative, deep, and amazingly addictive&quot; gameplay, &quot;steady and consistent&quot; learning curve, &quot;intuitive and natural&quot; controls, large and complex levels, &quot;jaw-dropping&quot; physics and &quot;perfect&quot; soundtrack. Perry concluded that the game had &quot;captured the pure grit and radical feel of skateboarding, delivering it in near perfect form onto the PlayStation with a mastery and sense of programming finesse beyond anyone&#x27;s imagination&quot;, and described the game as &quot;that rare gem of a game that defies what other developers say can&#x27;t be done&quot;. Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; commended the game&#x27;s graphics, frame rate, camera and sound effects, and declared the game to be &quot;a worthy addition to anyone&#x27;s PlayStation collection&quot;, though he was not personally fond of the soundtrack and wished that there was more variety in the game&#x27;s tricks. He additionally noted that the Dreamcast version used the console&#x27;s hardware to its advantage by displaying clearer textures and a smoother frame rate &quot;that may very well cause longtime fans of the game to weep&quot;. Chris Carle of &quot;IGN&quot; also praised the Dreamcast version&#x27;s improved textures.

Matt Casamassina of &quot;IGN&quot; praised the Nintendo 64 version&#x27;s visuals as &quot;very impressive&quot; in spite of the reduced quality of the textures and the omitted full-motion video effects, and the audio as &quot;surprisingly clear&quot;, albeit compressed and &quot;dumbed down&quot; to accommodate the cartridge format. Martin Taylor of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; cited the game&#x27;s graphics as &quot;crisp, smooth and very, very hard to fault&quot;, but noted that the game&#x27;s soundtrack suffered from the compression process and that the looping music &quot;quickly becomes incredibly annoying&quot;; the latter sentiment was mirrored by Dr. Moo of Game Revolution.

In reviewing the Game Boy Color version, Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; decided that while the half-pipe portion of the game &quot;isn&#x27;t half-bad&quot;, the overhead portion is &quot;absolutely stupid&quot;; he criticized the representation of tricks as static images as &quot;completely destroy[ing] the flow of the game&quot;, and noted that the issue is exacerbated in the &quot;Versus&quot; mode by having both parties&#x27; game pause when either one performs a trick. Frank Provo of &quot;GameSpot&quot; cited the game&#x27;s lack of level variety and &quot;borderline mediocre&quot; audio, but felt that it was the best skateboarding title to be made for a portable console. Both Chadd Chambers of &quot;IGN&quot; and Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; considered the N-Gage version to be the best game available on the system and were relatively impressed by the game&#x27;s graphics, but noted the less comfortable control scheme and reduced sound quality.

Three reviewers for &quot;Next Generation&quot; magazine - Blake Fischer, Eric Bratcher, and Greg Orlando - gave five stars out of five for PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Dreamcast versions, respectively. They virtually praised every aspect of the game, despite noting some minor differences between all three versions.

&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; was ranked #36 in &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; in its 100th issue in August 2001. The game was nominated for &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Console Sports Game of the Year&quot; during the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, but lost to &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; and &quot;Knockout Kings 2000&quot;, respectively. The game was included on &quot;Polygon&quot;&#x27;s 2017 list of The 500 Best Games of All Time.

===Sales===
&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; was the third highest-selling PlayStation title of November 1999 in the United States. From its release date to late-December 1999, the game shipped in excess of 350,000 units and was available in over 10,000 retailers nationwide. The PlayStation version of &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland gave the PlayStation version a Gold Award for 100,000 sold copies in Germany by February 2000. The PlayStation versions of &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; and its successor were respectively the third and second highest-selling console games of 2000. The Nintendo 64 version was the sixth highest-selling Nintendo 64 title in the United States during the week of November 19–26, 2000. As of 2001, it has sold 3.5 million units.

==Sequels==

The game resulted in a successful franchise, receiving eight annualized sequels developed by Neversoft from &quot;Pro Skater 2&quot; (2000) to &quot;Proving Ground&quot; (2007), and a 2020 remake along with the sequel, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2&quot;.

==Cultural impact==
&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; is credited with introducing skateboarding to a more mainstream global audience.

In a 2023 essay for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, Irish writer Jack Sheehan reflected on the game&#x27;s impact, writing: &quot;Released at a moment when skateboarding was beginning to go mainstream, &quot;T.H.P.S.&quot; became popular because it invited skaters and nonskaters alike to feel the thrill of getting air, doing a kick flip or landing a trick by the thinnest margin.&quot; In 2023, the book &quot;Right, Down + Circle: Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater&quot; by Cole Nowicki was released, tackling and analyzing &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot;″s meaning and impact. Reflecting on both the game&#x27;s development history and his personal experience as a skateboarder and player, Nowicki called the game an &quot;unprecedented success&quot; and a &quot;Trojan horse, entering the homes of millions worldwide, exposing kids, teenagers, their parents, and more to this gamified version of skateboarding.&quot;

In 2020, a documentary film &quot;Pretending I&#x27;m Superman: The Tony Hawk Video Game Story&quot; from Swedish director Ludvig Gür was released, chronicling the development and impact of the game.

Throughout the 2010s and 2020s, the game&#x27;s soundtrack was acknowledged as having been a major cultural influence in music, particularly in spreading punk and metal to millennials.

<doc id="289881" wikidata="Q254204" url="?curid=289881" title="Nankai University">
<text>Nankai University is a public university in Tianjin, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction.

Nankai University was established in 1919 as the private Nankai School by Yan Xiu and Zhang Boling. During the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1937 to 1945, Nankai University, Peking University and Tsinghua University merged and formed the National Changsha Provisional University, which later moved to Kunming and was renamed the National Southwestern Associated University (西南联大). On December 25, 2000, the State Ministry of Education signed an agreement with Tianjin Municipal Government to jointly establish and develop Nankai University.

Nankai&#x27;s alumni and faculty include the first Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China Zhou Enlai, mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern and Nobel laureates Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee.

== History ==
=== 1919–1937 ===
The university was founded as a private institution in 1919. Nankai&#x27;s scale was relatively small at its inception partly because it received no funding from the government but instead was funded by foreign charitable funds and local entrepreneurs, with only 3 departments (liberal arts, science, and business) and 96 students. It was noted particularly for its courses which were taught in English using foreign curricula and textbooks.

The well-known Nankai Institute of Economics was established in 1927 and soon became one of the most prominent in China being the first non-foreign entity to calculate a Chinese Consumer Price Index.

By 1937, Nankai had expanded into a university of 3 colleges, 13 departments, and 2 research institutes, with 429 students and 110 faculty and staff members.

It was once nicknamed &quot;The North Star of Higher Learning&quot;.

=== 1937–1949 ===
In July 1937, during the Sino-Japanese War, Nankai campus was severely damaged by Japanese bombings. About two-thirds of Nankai&#x27;s school buildings including its library were destroyed by the Japanese Imperial Army. A number of the school&#x27;s artifacts, including the university bell, were looted and remain in Japanese museums till this day.

In August 1937, still during the Sino-Japanese War, Nankai University, Peking University and Tsinghua University united to form the National Changsha Provisional University, which later moved to Kunming and was renamed the National Southwestern Associated University. On April 2, it was renamed &quot;National Southwestern Associated University. In 1946, after the war, Nankai returned to Tianjin and was reformed into a national university by the government. At that time, Nankai had four schools (Liberal Arts, Science, Political Science and Economics, and Engineering) and 16 departments.

=== 1949–1966 ===
After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Nankai was readjusted and became a comprehensive university with emphasis on the arts and sciences, with 14 departments and 3 professional specialties in total.

=== 1966–1976 ===
From 1966 to 1976 the School&#x27;s normal life was out of order due to the Cultural Revolution. In 1976 a catastrophic earthquake broke out in Tangshan, bordering Tianjin, causing damage of varying degrees to the School&#x27;s buildings.

=== 1976–present ===

In February 1978, the State Council decided to resume and set up national key colleges, Nankai University is identified as the first national key college.

After 1980, Nankai added a number of new specialties and institutes. In arts, applied specialties on financing were set up and the School of Economics was reopened in 1983, while in Sciences, interdisciplinary, marginal and high and new technological specialties were added.

&quot;Nankai University has also been a destination for Indian students pursuing higher education in China, with many benefiting from international scholarship programs such as the Swami Vivekananda Scholarship, which promotes cultural and educational exchange between India and China.[34]&quot;

Nankai was among the first universities in China to open its doors for students from America in the 1980s. In 1989, the university was ordered by the Tianjin public security bureau to send two Americans back home, following rising political tensions over pro-democracy demonstrations.

By the late 1980s, Nankai University had grown to be a comprehensive university embracing Humanities, Natural Sciences, Applied Sciences, Life Sciences, Managements and Art.

In 1994, Tianjin Foreign Trade College was merged to Nankai university. In 1999, under the combined efforts of Nankai and TEDA, TEDA College was set up. In 2000, the State Ministry of Education signed an agreement with Tianjin Municipal Government on jointly establishing and developing Nankai University. Experimental cooperation between Nankai University and Tianjin University was initiated on the principle of independent school-running and close cooperation. In 2002, under the cooperative efforts of Nankai, Government of Shenzhen and UC Berkeley, the Financial Engineering College was established in Shenzhen.

In May 2006, Nankai&#x27;s president Rao Zihe tendered 15 of the 21 university&#x27;s college dean positions, restaffing key positions in an effort to further improve the university&#x27;s educational programs.

In February 2015, following Chinese media reports and statements from inside the Chinese Communist Party that universities would have to &quot;be cleansed of liberal Western textbooks and other ideological heresies&quot;, Nankai&#x27;s president Gong Ke publicly stated: &quot;Recently I&#x27;ve read people on the Internet saying that the ranks of academics must be cleansed, purified and rectified. I can&#x27;t agree with this. This was the mentality of 1957 or 1966.&quot; and &quot;We cannot re-enact this history of &quot;leftist&quot; errors against intellectuals.&quot;

<doc id="289884" wikidata="Q1543478" url="?curid=289884" title="Algonquin Provincial Park">
<text>Algonquin Provincial Park is an Ontario provincial park located between Georgian Bay and the Ottawa River, mostly within the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District. Established in 1893, it is the oldest provincial park in Canada. Additions since its creation have increased the park to its current size of about . The park is contiguous with several smaller, administratively separate provincial parks that protect important rivers in the area, resulting in a larger total protected area.

Its size, combined with its proximity to the major urban centres of Toronto and Ottawa, makes Algonquin one of the most popular provincial parks in the province and the country. Highway 60 runs through the south end of the park, while the Trans-Canada Highway bypasses it to the north. Over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of streams and rivers are located within the park. Some notable examples include Canoe Lake and the Petawawa, Nipissing, Amable du Fond, Madawaska, and Tim rivers. These were formed by the retreat of the glaciers during the last ice age.

The park is considered part of the &quot;border&quot; between Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario. The park is in an area of transition between northern coniferous forest and southern deciduous forest. This unique mixture of forest types, and the wide variety of environments in the park, allows the park to support an uncommon diversity of plant and animal species. It is also an important site for wildlife research.

Algonquin Park was named a National Historic Site in 1992 in recognition of several heritage values including: its role in the development of park management; pioneering visitor interpretation programs later adopted by national and provincial parks across the country; its role in inspiring artists, which in turn gave Canadians a greater sense of their country; and historic structures such as lodges, hotels, cottages, camps, entrance gates (the West Gate was designed by George H. Williams, Chief Architect and Deputy Minister of Public Works for the Province of Ontario), a railway station, and administration and museum buildings.

Algonquin Park is the only designated park within the province of Ontario to allow industrial logging to take place within its borders.
==History==

===Early logging===
In the 19th century, the logging industry cut the large white pine and red pine trees to produce lumber for domestic and American markets, as well as square timber for export to Great Britain. The loggers were followed by small numbers of homesteaders and farmers. Even at that time, however, the area&#x27;s beauty was recognized by nature preservationists.

To manage these conflicting interests, the Ontario Government appointed a commission to inquire into and report on the matter. The act to establish Algonquin Park was drawn up in 1892 by this five member Royal Commission, made up of Alexander Kirkwood (the chairman and Commissioner of Crown Lands), James Dickson (Ontario Land Surveyor), Archibald Blue (director of mines), Robert Phipps (head of the Forestry Branch), and Aubrey White (Assistant Commissioner of Crown Lands). Their report recommended the establishment of a park in the territory lying near and enclosing the headwaters of five major rivers, those being: the Muskoka, Little Madawaska River (including Opeongo), Amable du Fond River, Petawawa River, and South rivers.

The commissioners remarked in their report: &quot;the experience of older countries had everywhere shown that the wholesale and indiscriminate slaughter of forests brings a host of evils in its train. Wide tracts are converted from fertile plains into arid desert, springs and streams are dried up, and the rainfall, instead of percolating gently through the forest floor and finding its way by easy stages by brook and river to the lower levels, now descends the valley in hurrying torrents, carrying before it tempestuous floods.&quot;
*Report of the (Ontario) Royal Commission on Forest Conservation and National Park, Mar. 8, 1893

Although much of the area within Algonquin had been under license for some time, it was intended to make the park an example of good forestry practices. Only licenses to cut pine would be issued. The commissioners had recommended that when the hardwood was mature, it too should be cut.

====Dark Day fire====
Researchers believe that smoke from a forest fire in Algonquin Park was responsible for New England&#x27;s Dark Day of May 19, 1780. This is based on investigations into scar marks which are left in the growth rings of trees that survive forest fires. Data obtained from such scar marks make it possible to approximate the date of a past fire.

===Current logging===
Industrial logging continues in significant portions of the park&#x27;s interior. After 2013 amendments to the park management plan, 65.3% of the park (498,785 hectares) remains in the recreation/utilization zone where logging is permitted. Numerous methods of logging take place throughout the park including clear cutting, selection cutting and shelterwood cutting.

, the Algonquin Forestry Authority is currently reviewing an application that would allow for expansion of current logging roads and the addition of new ones.

Forestry activities in Algonquin, including logging are carried out in accordance with a Forest Management Plan prepared according to Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry requirements. The planning process includes public consultation opportunities at several stages of preparation. The 2010–2020 approved Forest Management Plan for the Algonquin Park Forest, the 2015–2020 Phase 2 Plan, and the associated Annual Work Schedules and Reports are available on the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry&#x27;s website.

===Park formation===
An Act to establish &quot;Algonquin National Park of Ontario&quot; was passed by the Liberal government of Oliver Mowat in the Ontario Legislature, May 23, 1893 (56 Vic., c.8). The name &quot;Algonquin&quot; refers to the Algonquin people, indigenous inhabitants of the area.

Although called a &quot;national park&quot;, Algonquin has always been under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. No provincial parks existed until Algonquin, but there was a new movement to create national parks since Banff&#x27;s establishment in 1885. The name was changed to Algonquin Provincial Park in 1913.
*Notice regarding establishment of &#x27;The Algonquin National Park of Ontario&#x27;, Sept. 27, 1893, transcribed on &quot;Death On a Painted Lake: The Death of Tom Thomson&quot;
*Archibald M. Campbell, &quot;The Algonquin National Park of Ontario-Its Resources and Advantages&quot;, The Ottawa Naturalist XV (June, 1901): 80-89, transcribed on &quot;Death On a Painted Lake: The Death of Tom Thomson&quot;

The boundaries of the park included 18 townships within the District of Nipissing, covering an area of of which 10% was under water. The tract of land was to be set apart, as a public park, health resort and pleasure ground for the benefit, advantage and enjoyment of all the people of the province. The year following the park&#x27;s creation saw portions of six new townships added to the existing park&#x27;s boundaries (Paxton, McCraney, Finlayson, Butt, Ballantyne, and Boyd). The first four were put up for auction that same year. The production of the lumber companies operating in the park at the time increased from 680,000 m3 (288 million board feet) in 1886 to 809,000 m3 (343 million board feet) in 1896.

Peter Thomson, the first chief ranger of Algonquin Park, was responsible for establishing park boundaries, constructing buildings, and posting notices to warn hunters and trappers against trespassing. He liaised with timber operators, oversaw the removal of settlers and their homes, and notified local Algonquin natives that they could no longer hunt, trap or live in the area. 

Park rangers began patrolling the park, the game protected, and forest fires were suppressed. By 1910 wildlife numbers were increasing. Thousands of people had visited the great pleasure resort and it was said to be undeniably one of the most beautiful natural parks in the Dominion, if not on this continent. All this had entailed a large expenditure by the government, which was recovered chiefly through the maintenance of timber licenses. There was no fee for camping permits, though a nominal charge was introduced for fishing and guides&#x27; licenses when &quot;an Act to establish the Algonquin National Park of Ontario&quot; was again passed by the legislature, March 19, 1910. This new legislation included the original area as well as portions of ten townships annexed into the park since 1893, and allowed for further expansion by the addition of adjacent townships, should it become necessary.

Another notable figure in park management was Frank MacDougall, the park&#x27;s chief ranger from 1931 to 1941. He was the first ranger to supervise the park by airplane, flying a Fairchild KR-34. He eventually became deputy minister for the provincial Ministry of Lands and Forests, and the portion of Highway 60 which passes through Algonquin Park has been named the Frank A. MacDougall Parkway in his honour.

===Railway, settlement, and the beginning of tourism===

Construction of the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway (O. A. &amp; P. S.) through the park in 1896 provided the first easy access to the area. While the park&#x27;s purpose was to control settlement within its boundaries, the families of railway workers as well as those of the lumbermen took up residence in the park. The village of Mowat on the west side of Canoe Lake was first established in 1893 as a logging camp for the Gilmour Lumber Company. From there, logs were driven down the Oxtongue River towards Lake of Bays and eventually on to Trenton. In the same year the park headquarters was established near the logging camp. The arrival of the railway had provided easy access for the lumbermen as well. The Gilmour firm decided to put up a sawmill closer to their source of timber. By 1897 the village of Mowat had grown to 500 residents and there were of railway siding.

The same year saw the official opening of the railway between Ottawa and Depot Harbour. Park headquarters were also relocated in 1897 from Mowat to a point of land on the north shore of Cache Lake, adjacent to the railway. The O. A. &amp; P. S. put up a station there it named Algonquin Park. The railway, taken over by the Canada Atlantic Railway in 1899, was in turn sold to the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) in 1905.

In 1898 George W. Bartlett was appointed as the second superintendent of Algonquin Park, replacing the late Peter Thompson. Placed under the direction of the Premier of Ontario to make the park self-sufficient, Bartlett worked to make the park more attractive to tourists by encouraging short-term leases for cottages, lodges, and camps. Changes came about in 1908, when Hotel Algonquin was opened at Joe Lake. The Grand Trunk Railway opened its first hotel, the Highland Inn, near Park Headquarters. Built on a hill behind Algonquin Park station, the two-storey year-round resort was an immediate success. Soon other guest lodges were established in the park. To the west side of Highland Inn, land was cleared and raised wooden platforms erected, on which tents (supplied by the hotel), were put up to meet the requirements of the rapidly growing tourist trade.

At the village of Mowat, abandoned by Gilmour Lumber Co. in 1900, the mill&#x27;s former boarding house became Mowat Lodge in 1913. The Highland Inn was enlarged, and new camps were built. Nominigan Camp, consisting of a main lodge with six cabins of log construction, was established on Smoke Lake. Camp Minnesing on Burnt Island Lake was created as a wilderness lodge. Both, open only in July and August, were built by the GTR as affiliates of the Highland Inn.

A second railway, the Canadian Northern (CNoR), was built across the northern portion of the park, opening in 1915. Both lines later became part of Canadian National Railway. The beginning of the end of rail service in the park happened in 1933 when a flood damaged an old Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway trestle on Cache Lake. The trestle was deemed too dangerous to use and too expensive to fix, ending through service on the southern line (old O.A. &amp; P.S.). Service from the west ended in 1952, and from the east in 1959. Service on the old CNoR line through the north end of the park ended in 1995. Many of the trails in the park still make use of portions of the old railway rights-of-way.

===Administration and management===
As recreational use of the park increased during the 1950s and 1960s, it became clear that a long-term plan to manage the park was required. Six years of consultation with park users resulted in the 1974 publication of the Algonquin Master Plan, a management plan that sought to ensure that the park could continue indefinitely to serve all of the competing park interests. Three major changes came about as a result of the plan. One, the park was divided into zones with different specified purposes and uses: Nature Reserve and Historic (5.7% of land area), Wilderness (12%), Development (4.3%) and Recreation-Utilization (78%) zones. Logging in the park was limited to the Recreation-Utilization zones, but was separated as much as possible from users of the park interior in order to maintain the park&#x27;s natural environment. Each year only a small percentage of the park is being actively logged. Two, all existing timber licenses were cancelled, and all logging in the park is now done by the Algonquin Forestry Authority, which supplies timber to 10 private mills outside the park. Three, rules were put in place to limit the impact of recreational use of the park. Almost all cans and bottles are banned in the interior, and limits are placed on the number of people per campsite, and the number of people who can enter the park interior per day at each access point. Also, the use of boat motors is limited, both in power and to a few of the larger and more accessible lakes. The master plan has been reviewed and updated four times since 1974, with the latest version being published in 1999.

==Climate==
The park has a humid continental climate (Köppen Climate Classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with long, cold, snowy winters and warm summers. In winter, temperatures frequently drop below while in summer, temperatures can exceed 9 days per year. Precipitation averages per year, which is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with late summer/early fall being the wettest months and the winter months being the driest.
==Legacy of landscapes==
As a result of its beauty, Algonquin Park became recognized by nature preservationists. It quickly became popular with anglers, though hunting was prohibited.

The landscapes of Algonquin Park attracted artists such as Tom Thomson along with members of the Group of Seven. Thomson served as a guide in the park, often working from Mowat Lodge. He did much of his painting at Canoe Lake, and a favourite campsite of his was behind Hayhurst Point, a peninsula overlooking the central portion of the lake. Many of Thomson&#x27;s most significant paintings are of Algonquin Park, including &quot;The Jack Pine&quot; and &quot;The West Wind&quot;. He died under mysterious circumstances at Canoe Lake in 1917. A plaque recognizing his national historic significance stands at the Visitor Centre dock on Canoe Lake, erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. Friends of the painter erected a cairn and totem pole memorial on Hayhurst Point, near the north end of the lake.

==Visitor activities==
Algonquin is popular for year-round outdoor activities. There are over 1,200 campsites in eight designated campgrounds along Highway 60 in the south end of the park, with almost 100 others in three other campgrounds across the northern and eastern edges. There is also the Whitefish Lake group campground with 18 sites of various sizes to accommodate groups of 20, 30, or 40 people. Interior Camping is possible further inside the park at sites accessible only by canoe or on foot.

The Algonquin Visitor Centre features exhibits about the natural and cultural history of the park. A large and detailed relief map of southern Ontario is displayed to enable a visitor to be oriented to the size and geography of the park. In a flow-through style, exhibits continue with many taxidermied species set in their native surroundings, then progresses, in a chronological manner, through an extensive collection of artifacts relating to human intervention in the park. The centre also includes a video theatre, a gift shop, a panoramic outdoor viewing deck, and an art gallery—&quot;The Algonquin Room&quot;—with changing exhibits of art related to the park.
Other activities include fishing, mountain biking, horseback riding, cross country skiing, and day hiking. The park has 19 interpretive trails, ranging in length from . Each trail comes with a trail guide and is meant to introduce visitors to a different aspect of the park&#x27;s ecology or history.

Algonquin is home to a Natural Heritage Education program. The most popular aspect of the program are the weekly wolf howls. These are held (weather and wolves permitting) on Thursdays in the month of August, and sometimes in the first week of September if there is a Thursday before Labour Day. Park staff attempt to locate a wolf pack on Wednesday evening and, if successful, they announce a public wolf howl the next day.

The park also publishes a visitor&#x27;s newsletter, &quot;The Raven&quot;, six times a year – two issues in spring, two in summer, one in the fall, and one in the winter.

===Algonquin Logging Museum===
Opened in 1992, the Algonquin Logging Museum is located by the park&#x27;s east gate. A trail features a recreated logging camp, a steam-powered amphibious tug called an &quot;alligator&quot;, logging equipment and interpretive panels about logging industry activities in the park. Exhibits include a video presentation. The museum is open seasonally.

One annual feature worthy of note at the museum is &quot;Logger&#x27;s Day&quot;, typically held in late July or early August each year. This festivity includes musicians, a logger&#x27;s old style lunch, activities for children, interpretive actors, and forest industry representatives.

===Canoe routes===
Canoe camping is one of the most popular activities. This wilderness experience, essentially, a pristine wilderness canoe journey through vastness of the park, allows the tourist to enjoy the interior of Algonquin Park in ways inaccessible by any other means. The &quot;Friends of Algonquin Park&quot; organization publishes an authoritative map and guide called &quot;Canoe Routes of Algonquin Park&quot;.

===Aspects of interior camping===
Although there are numerous drive-in campgrounds in Algonquin, the park is better known for its interior camping; that is, campsites which are only accessible by canoe or hiking in the summer, or ski or snowshoe in the winter. Algonquin Park provides some of Canada&#x27;s best canoeing, with hundreds of navigable lakes and rivers forming a interconnected system of canoe routes. The two main access points to start a trip are located on Canoe Lake and Lake Opeongo. The further a camper proceeds from these access points, the more wild the park becomes, and it is possible to spend several days in the interior with few or no sightings of other campers. Park staff maintain portages between all major and even smaller lakes, and interior campsite reservations can be made through the main Ontario Parks reservation system.

There are also three areas of back-country hiking trails, with sub-loops ranging from long. These hiking trails have their own dedicated campsites, typically located on the shores of small lakes. Although some lakes have sites for both canoe and hiking access, the sites are designated by type of use.

Interior camping can provide excellent wildlife viewing opportunities. The eerie call of the common loon can be heard from every campground and loons can be seen on almost every lake. Moose, deer and beaver can often be seen, especially along waterways, given sufficiently quiet campers. Otters are also present, but less frequently seen. Black bears, although present in the park, are seldom seen, especially if appropriate precautions to avoid attracting them are taken. Wolves may be heard, but will likely remain distant from campers.

===Fishing===

Fishing is allowed in the park for holders of valid Ontario fishing licences, with the purchase of a daily or seasonal vehicle permit as well available through the Ministry of Natural Resources. Fish such as bass, yellow perch, trout and pike can be found in the waterways of the park. The further an angler is willing to travel from an access point, the better the fishing. The backcountry lakes do not receive heavy fishing pressure.

==Services==
The non-profit Friends of Algonquin Park operate a tourist information station, CFOA-FM.
A direct bus shuttle from Toronto is being run by Parkbus, a non-profit initiative, which is supported by the park.

==Research==
Algonquin Park has been an important arena for research since the 1930s. Four research facilities exist: Harkness Laboratory of Fisheries Research, Wildlife Research Station, Timber Research Station, and the visitor centre. Over 1800 scientific papers have been published on research done in the park, covering almost every aspect of the park: wildlife, geology, forestry, history, human impacts, etc. In addition, the Park forms a radio quiet zone for the Algonquin Radio Observatory (ARO).

==Summer camps==
Algonquin Park has been home to many historic summer camps including:
*Algonquin Experience Camp, a now-defunct YMCA camp that was on the north shore of Whitefish Lake;
*Camp Ahmek (boys) and Camp Wapomeo (girls) (The Taylor Statten Camps), on Canoe Lake
*Camp Arowhon (boys and girls) on Teepee Lake;

*Camp Pathfinder (boys) on Source Lake;
*Northway Lodge (girls) and its affiliate Camp Wendigo, a tripping outpost for boys, on Cache Lake;
*Camp Tamakwa (boys and girls), on South Tea Lake;
*Camp Tanamakoon (girls) on Tanamakoon Lake (linked to Cache Lake);

Camps are members of the Ontario Camping Association.

==Geology and soils==
Algonquin is almost entirely underlain by the Precambrian-era metamorphic and igneous rock of the Canadian Shield. Quartz-feldspar gneiss and granite are among the most common types. More mafic rock such as hornblende-biotite gneiss and gabbro are occasionally found. The Brent Crater has Ordovician period sedimentary rock, chiefly limestone and sandstone. Glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch left a mantle of glacial till plus sandy and gravelly outwash deposits.

Soils in the park are mostly coarse-textured and of poor quality, typical of the Canadian Shield. The hilly western side (which includes all of the Highway 60 Corridor) has a stony fine sandy loam glacial till which holds water better than the very coarse outwash soils which dominate the eastern side. The dominant soil classification on well drained forest soils is Orthic Humo-Ferric Podzol. The most common soil series on till upland is &quot;Monteagle&quot;, while &quot;Wendigo&quot; dominates the outwash area. Classic podzol profile development with a well-defined eluvial (Ae) horizon is the rule; however, in some areas this horizon has been obliterated by disturbance such as earthworm activity. Concerns about effects of non-native earthworms on park soil ecosystems have not led to the banning of worm bait, but anglers are urged to dispose of unused worms in garbage containers.

Gleysolic and organic soils are common where drainage is poor.

==Rivers==
The park contains and protects the headwaters of these rivers:
*Amable du Fond River
*Barron River
*Bonnechere River
*Gull River
*Madawaska River
*Magnetawan River
*Muskoka River
*Petawawa River
*York River

==Flora and fauna==

Within the boundaries of the park, the following number of species are known to live: 53 species of mammals, 272 species of birds, 31 species of reptiles and amphibians, 54 species of fish, about 7000 species of insects, over 1000 species of plants, and over 1000 species of fungi. Animals that inhabit Algonquin include moose, black bears, white-tailed deer, Canada jays, beavers, red foxes, great grey owls, and Eastern wolf.

Old growth sugar maple, hemlock and yellow birch forests are common in Algonquin Park. Researchers have aged trees in Algonquin&#x27;s old-growth forests at up to 430 years old using ring counts, and up to 610 years old using estimation techniques. Some of Algonquin Park&#x27;s old-growth forest occurs in the recreation-utilization zone and is available for logging.

<doc id="289890" wikidata="Q1406374" url="?curid=289890" title="Piglet's Big Movie">
<text>Piglet&#x27;s Big Movie is a 2003 American animated musical adventure comedy-drama film produced by the Japanese office of Disneytoon Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The animation production was by Walt Disney Animation Japan, Inc. with additional animation provided by Gullwing Co., Ltd., additional background by Studio Fuga and digital ink and paint by T2 Studio. The film features the characters from the &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; books written by A. A. Milne and E. H. Shepard and is the third theatrically released &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; feature. It was released on March 21, 2003, to generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $62.9 million worldwide. In this film, Piglet is ashamed of being small and clumsy and wanders off into the Hundred Acre Wood, leading all of his friends to form a search party to find him.

==Plot==
Piglet has made a scrapbook containing pictures that depict all of the adventures he has gone on with his friends. One day, Piglet meets Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit, and Eeyore, who exclude him from their plot to steal a swarm of bees&#x27; honey, because of his small size, even after Piglet saves them from being attacked by the bees. Disheartened, Piglet sets out to discover how he can be useful. Meanwhile, Piglet&#x27;s friends discover his disappearance and decide to search for him; using Piglet&#x27;s scrapbook as a guide, they use its pictures to tell the stories depicted therein, leading to several flashbacks.

The first story tells when Kanga and Roo first moved to the Hundred Acre Wood. Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, and Rabbit are afraid of the newcomers and Rabbit concocts a plan to use Piglet as a decoy, so they can ransom Roo to force Kanga to leave. When Kanga finds out about the plan, she plays along by pretending that Piglet is Roo, eventually causing Piglet to realize Kanga&#x27;s kindness, which prompts his friends to accept the kangaroos into the Hundred Acre Wood. Back in the present, Roo joins the others in searching for Piglet.

The second story tells how everyone in the Hundred Acre Wood went on an expedition to find the North Pole. During the search, Roo falls into a river, prompting Piglet to use a long stick to launch him out. However, his heroism is overlooked when he gives the stick to Pooh to try to catch Roo, where he is caught by his mother, causing Christopher Robin to mistake the stick for the North Pole and credit Pooh for finding it. Back in the present, the friends begin to realize how much they have ignored Piglet&#x27;s actions.

The third story tells the building of the House at Pooh Corner. Pooh, Piglet, and Tigger get the idea of building Eeyore a house in an area they name &quot;Pooh Corner&quot;, using some neatly stacked sticks for building. After many failed attempts, Pooh decides to offer Eeyore to move in with him only for Eeyore to reveal that the sticks Pooh, Piglet and Tigger found was actually his house. Piglet manages to rebuild Eeyore&#x27;s house and shows it to him, satisfying the donkey.

Back in the present, an argument between Rabbit and Tigger ends with the scrapbook falling into a river. Without their guide and with a storm coming, the group sadly return to Piglet&#x27;s house, where they draw pictures depicting all of Piglet&#x27;s heroic actions. Eventually feeling reinvigorated, they decide to resume their search for Piglet. During their search, they find Piglet&#x27;s scrapbook suspended on a hollow log looming over a waterfall. Pooh goes to retrieve it, but he falls into a hole in the log, and the others are unable to reach him. At that moment, Piglet arrives and, with encouragement from his friends, helps pull Pooh to safety just as the log begins to break in half. Everyone manages to escape right when the front half of the log breaks off, but the scrapbook itself is destroyed by the fall. Although saddened by this loss, the group take Piglet back to his house to show him all of their drawings, much to Piglet&#x27;s joy.

Sometime later, a party is thrown in honor of Piglet, where Pooh reveals that he renamed Eeyore&#x27;s home &quot;Pooh and Piglet Corner&quot; to represent all the big things that Piglet has ever done. During this scene, the camera pulls back to show a large shadow of Piglet behind everyone.

==Production==
&quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Movie&quot; was produced by Disneytoon Studios, Walt Disney Animation (Japan), Gullwing Co., Ltd, Studio Fuga, and T2 Studio.

The film was originally intended as a direct-to-video release, in February 2002 Disney announced that the film and &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot; would be released theatrically.

==Music==

American singer-songwriter Carly Simon wrote seven new songs for the film, and performed six of them (&quot;If I Wasn&#x27;t So Small&quot;, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Intuition&quot;, &quot;Sing Ho for the Life of a Bear&quot;, &quot;With a Few Good Friends&quot;, &quot;The More I Look Inside&quot;, and &quot;Comforting to Know&quot;), as well as recording her own version of the Sherman brothers&#x27; &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; theme song which she previously recorded in &quot;A Very Merry Pooh Year&quot;.

&quot;The More It Snows&quot; features Jim Cummings and John Fiedler, as Pooh and Piglet. Simon was accompanied by her children Ben Taylor and Sally Taylor on many of the songs. Renée Fleming accompanied Simon on the song &quot;Comforting to Know&quot;. On &quot;Sing Ho for the Life of a Bear&quot; Simon was accompanied by the cast.

The soundtrack also features five tracks of the film&#x27;s score by Carl Johnson, as well as five of Simon&#x27;s original demonstration recordings.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Movie&quot; was number seven on the box-office charts on its opening weekend, earning $6 million. The film domestically grossed $23 million, half the amount of what &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; earned, and it grossed nearly $63 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a rating of 70% based on 77 reviews, and an average rating of 6.2/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus is &quot;Wholesome and charming entertainment for young children.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 62/100 based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A, on a scale of A+ to F.

Film critic Stephen Holden of &quot;New York Times&quot; called the film an &quot;oasis of gentleness and wit&quot;. Nancy Churnin of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; stated that &quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Movie&quot; was &quot;one of the nifty pleasures in the process&quot;, despite her belief that &quot;Disney may be milking its classics&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Games==

In 2003, Disney released &quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Game&quot; for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance, as well as a game on CD-ROM that was also entitled &quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Game&quot;. The latter was developed by Doki Denki Studio and involves helping Piglet assist in the preparation for a &quot;Very Large Soup Party&quot;. In their review, Edutaining Kids praised various features including the adventure/exploration aspect (the game is linear instead of using a main screen) and many of the activities (such as the color mixing, which they said offers an incredible variety of hues), but noted that it is much too brief and that Kanga and Roo are absent.

==Sources==

The film&#x27;s plot is based primarily on five A. A. Milne stories: &quot;In which Piglet meets a Heffalump,&quot; &quot;In which Kanga and Baby Roo Come to the Forest, and Piglet Has a Bath,&quot; and &quot;In which Christopher Robin Leads an Expedition to the North Pole&quot; (chapters 5, 7, and 8 of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;); and &quot;In which a house is built at Pooh Corner for Eeyore&quot; and &quot;In which a search is organized and Piglet nearly meets the Heffalump again&quot; (chapters 1 and 3 of &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot;).

<text>Charles Albert &quot;Chief&quot; Bender (May 5, 1884 – May 22, 1954) was a Native American professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball during the 1900s and 1910s. In 1911, Bender tied a record by pitching three complete games in a single World Series. He finished his career with a 212–127 win–loss record for a .625 winning percentage and a career 2.46 earned run average (ERA).

After his major league playing career, Bender&#x27;s roles in baseball included major league coach, minor league manager and player-manager, college manager, and professional scout. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953 and died the following year.

==Early life==
Bender was born in Crow Wing County, Minnesota, as a member of the White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. His father was German and his mother was part Chippewa. As a child, he was named &quot;Mandowescence&quot;, which might be translated into English as &quot;Little Spirit Animal&quot;. His family had on the White Earth Indian Reservation near Detroit Lakes, Minnesota. His father taught him to farm on the reservation. He graduated from Carlisle Indian Industrial School and attended Dickinson College.

==Baseball career==
===Early career===
Bender debuted in the major leagues in 1903. He is one of only a few pitchers in the 20th century to throw 200 or more innings at the age of 19. His walks per nine innings rate were 2.17; only a few pitchers since 1893 have had a rate below 2.2 at the age of 20 or younger. That year, he also won a game against Cy Young and met his future wife Marie.

In 1905, Bender earned an 18–11 win–loss record with a 2.83 ERA, helping the A&#x27;s win the AL pennant; but they lost the World Series in five games to the New York Giants. Bender went 1–1 with a 1.06 ERA in the series, pitching a 4-hit, 3–0 complete-game shutout in Game 2, striking out 9. He went the distance again in Game 5, giving up just two earned runs in eight innings, losing 2–0 to Christy Mathewson.

After solid seasons in 1906 (15–10, 2.53), 1907 (16–8, 2.05), 1908 (8–9 despite a 1.75 ERA), and 1909 (18–8, 1.66), he led the Athletics to the AL pennant in 1910, as Philadelphia went 102–48, games ahead of the second-place New York Highlanders. Bender led the AL in winning percentage, at .821, going 23–5 with a 1.58 ERA. He went 1–1 with a 1.93 ERA in the World Series as the A&#x27;s beat the Chicago Cubs, who had gone 104–50 in the regular season, in five games. Bender pitched a complete-game three-hitter in the opener, striking out 8 and giving up only one unearned run. He lost Game 4 of the series in another complete-game effort, 4–3 in 10 innings. Bender pitched all innings for the Athletics, striking out 6.

===Later career===
In 1911, he led the AL in winning percentage again (.773), going 17–5 with a 2.16 ERA as the A&#x27;s won their second consecutive AL pennant, going 101–50 and finishing games ahead of the Detroit Tigers. In a rematch of the 1905 World Series, the Athletics got their revenge, defeating the New York Giants and becoming the first American League team to win back-to-back World Series (the Chicago Cubs from the NL had won back-to-back titles in 1907 and 1908). After losing the opener 2–1 to Mathewson, though pitching a complete game, giving up just 5 hits and 2 runs (1 earned run) and striking out 11, Bender returned in Game 4, beating the Giants 4–2 on a complete game 7-hitter, and closed out the Series in game 6 with a 13–2 A&#x27;s victory. Bender again went the distance (his 3rd complete game of the series), a 4-hit performance which he gave up no earned runs (the two Giants runs were unearned). He went 2–1, with 1.04 ERA and 3 complete games in the series.

In 1912 Bender was 13–8 with a 2.74 ERA. He did not start for nearly 40 games late in the year and was suspended by the A&#x27;s in September for alcohol abuse. His next contract had a clause saying he had to abstain from drinking to earn his full salary. In 1913, he went 21–10 with a 2.21 ERA, helping the A&#x27;s win their third AL pennant in four years. They would also make it three World Series titles in four years by defeating the Giants in five games. Bender went 2–0 in the series with complete-game victories in Games 1 and 4.

He led the AL in winning percentage (.850) for the third time in 1914, going 17–3 with a 2.26 ERA, and the A&#x27;s would win their fourth AL pennant in five years. But the Athletics would be swept by the underdog Boston Braves, with Bender losing Game 1 7–1, giving up 6 earned runs in innings. It was the only World Series game he failed to finish, after completing his previous nine starts in the Fall Classic.

When the Baltimore Terrapins of the upstart Federal League offered Bender a large salary increase, Athletics manager Connie Mack knew he could not hope to match it and released Bender. In his only season with the Terrapins, Bender went 4–16, and his 3.99 ERA was near the bottom of the league. Bender later regretted leaving Philadelphia for the upstart league. After two years with the Philadelphia Phillies, he left baseball in 1918 to work in the shipyards during World War I.

Over his career, his win–loss record was 212–127, for a .625 winning percentage (a category in which he led the American League in three seasons), and a career 2.46 ERA. His talent was even more noticeable in the high-pressure environment of the World Series; in five trips to the championship series, he managed six wins and a 2.44 ERA, completing 9 of the 10 games he started, putting him second in World Series history behind Christy Mathewson. In the 1911 Series, he pitched three complete games to tie Mathewson&#x27;s record of three complete games in a World Series. He also threw a no-hitter on May 12, 1910, beating the Cleveland Indians 4–0.

Bender was an adept hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .212 batting average (243-for-1,147) with 102 runs, 6 home runs and 116 RBI. Bender notably hit two home runs in one game—rare for the dead ball era—in a 1906 game where he replaced outfielder Topsy Hartsel. He had 10 or more RBI in a season four times, with a career-high 16 in 1910.

===Minor leagues===
In 1919, Bender pitched in the minor leagues for the Richmond Colts of the Virginia League. He earned a 29–2 record that year. He spent the next three seasons as a player-manager: the first two seasons with the New Haven Weissmen/Indians and the third was with the Class AA Reading Aces. For the 1920 New Haven team, Bender recorded 25 wins as a pitcher. His record declined to 13–7 in 1921 and 8–13 in 1922.

In 1923 and 1924, Bender did not manage, but did pitch for the minor league Baltimore Orioles and the New Haven Profs, respectively. He went 6–3 with a 5.03 ERA for Baltimore, then went 6–4 with a 3.07 ERA for New Haven.

===Coaching career===
Bender came back to the majors as a coach for the Chicago White Sox (1925–26) and even made a cameo appearance on the mound in 1925. Between 1924 and 1928, Bender managed the baseball team at the United States Naval Academy, where he had a 42–34–2. In 1931, he coached for the Giants and the next year managed the Yankees affiliate in the Central League. He then returned to the Athletics where he worked the rest of his life as a scout, minor league manager, and coach.

==Personal==
Bender was nicknamed &quot;Chief&quot;, a common nickname for baseball players of Native American descent. Biographer Tom Swift writes that Bender &quot;was often portrayed as a caricature and was the subject of myriad cartoons – many exhibits of narrow-mindedness. After he threw one of the most dominating games of the early years of the American League, Bender was depicted wielding a tomahawk and wearing a headdress as though he was a happy warrior.&quot;

He also faced discrimination on the field. Swift writes that taunting from the bench was common in Bender&#x27;s era and that the opposition or the fans often made war whoops or yelled taunts such as &quot;Nig!&quot; or &quot;Back to the reservation!&quot; Bender usually remained calm, sometimes smiling at the insults. After an inning in which he had pitched particularly well, he might yell back, &quot;Foreigners! Foreigners!&quot;

Off the baseball field, Bender was one of several prominent baseball players who enjoyed trap shooting, bowling, and golf. He felt that shooting in the offseason helped to train his eye and increase his self-control. He worked in sporting goods at Wanamaker&#x27;s in Philadelphia during his early playing days. He opened his own store, Bender Sporting Goods, in 1914.

In February 1917, Bender was charged with manslaughter when a car he owned struck and killed a boy in Philadelphia and the driver sped off. He was cleared of wrongdoing later the same month by a coroner&#x27;s jury.

Bender&#x27;s brother, John C. Bender, also played professional baseball. John Bender was suspended from minor league baseball for three years beginning in 1908 after he stabbed his manager, Win Clark, several times during a fight. John Bender is sometimes erroneously described as having died on a baseball field, but he died at a restaurant in 1911, not long after attempting a professional baseball comeback.

==Later life==
Late in his life, Bender&#x27;s friend John Burns gave him a plot of land in Haddon Heights, New Jersey. Bender planted a garden on the land and worked with it almost every day, even though he lived in Philadelphia, about 12 miles away. He grew fruits and vegetables, especially corn, and ate, sold, or gave away what he grew. After the 1950 season, Bender took his last position in the major leagues, replacing Mickey Cochrane as the pitching coach for the Athletics. Bender&#x27;s coaching helped pitcher Bobby Shantz win the American League Most Valuable Player Award in 1952. Bender was struggling with health problems, including arthritis and a cancer he did not disclose, during his tenure with Philadelphia.

In his last days, Bender remained close friends with Athletics coach Bing Miller, who used to bring Bender a container of ice cream almost every day. Bender was hospitalized in Philadelphia in mid-April 1954. He died there on May 22, 1954, of prostate cancer. He had also been suffering from cardiac problems. While he had been hospitalized, Bender sent Marie to Shibe Park for each home game so that she could report back to him on his team&#x27;s pitching.

Bender was buried in the Philadelphia suburb of Roslyn, Pennsylvania.

==Legacy==
Bender was well-liked by his fellow players. Teammate Rube Bressler called him &quot;one of the kindest and finest men who ever lived&quot;. Ty Cobb praised his intelligence, describing a play by Bender in the 1911 World Series as &quot;the greatest bit of brainwork I ever saw in a ballgame&quot;. Cobb was not alone in regard for his intelligence; Bender drew similar praise from many other teammates, opponents, and umpires, including Billy Evans and Nap Lajoie. Bender was also known for his keen eye and ability to discern subtle details of opposing pitchers&#x27; motions to help his teammates predict their pitches. His success led other teams to suspect Bender and the Athletics were stealing signs; though teammate Cy Morgan denied the A&#x27;s were stealing signs, Danny Murphy praised Bender&#x27;s ability and said he could &quot;come pretty near to getting anybody&#x27;s signs.&quot; Mack often put this skill to use by occasionally using Bender as the third or first base coach on days he wasn&#x27;t scheduled to pitch.

The innovator of the slider is debated, but some credit Bender as the first to use the pitch, then called a &quot;nickel curve&quot;, in the 1910s. Bender used his slider to help him achieve a no-hitter and win 212 games.

Bender was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953, less than a year before his death. He died before his induction ceremony and Marie accepted the Hall of Fame plaque on his behalf.

In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. The Minnesota Humanities Center published a children book about his life, &quot;Charles Albert Bender: National Hall of Fame Pitcher&quot;, written by Kade Ferris (Turtle Mountain Chippewa/Métis) and illustrated by Tashia Hart (Red Lake Chippewa).

<doc id="289894" wikidata="Q573863" url="?curid=289894" title="Cargo bike">
<text>There have been many human powered vehicles designed and constructed specifically for transporting loads since their earliest appearance in the 20th century. They are referred to variously depending on the number of wheels — typically two, three, or four — and by their specific use. Adjectives used to describe the tasks to which the bicycles, dicycles, tricycles, or quadracycles are put include cargo cycles (bi- / tri- / etc.), freight cycles, box cycles (due to the luggage carrier&#x27;s shape), carrier cycles, and so on. Sometimes they are also called cycletrucks, which uses a sense of the word &#x27;truck&#x27; predating the automobile.

Cargo bike designs include a cargo area consisting of an open or enclosed box, a flat platform, or a wire basket, usually mounted over one or both wheels, low behind the front wheel, or between parallel wheels at either the front or rear of the vehicle. The frame, drivetrain and wheels must be constructed to handle loads larger than those on an ordinary bicycle.

== Development ==

The first cargo bikes were used by tradesmen to deliver mail, bread and milk amongst other things. Early cargo bikes were heavy-duty standard bicycles, with heavy carriers at front or rear, sometimes with a smaller front wheel to accommodate a large front carrier. During the early part of the 20th century these were commonly used by tradesmen for local deliveries. In the UK this style is still sometimes known as a &quot;butcher&#x27;s bike&quot; or &quot;delibike&quot;, although the Post Office have by far the largest fleet.

With the domination of the internal combustion engine in the industrialized countries after World War II, cargo bikes became less popular. In the rest of the world, however, they continued to be manufactured and heavily used. In the 2000s, ecologically minded designers and small-scale manufacturers initiated a revival of the cargo bike manufacturing sector.

Some cargo bike makers and users use power assist motors to complement the power of the cyclist. Power assist can increase the payload and range of cargo bikes, but also increases the cost of the bicycle and requires an on-board battery.

== Common uses ==
Cargo bikes are used in a variety of settings:
* Delivery services in dense urban environments
* Transporting children
* Food vending in high foot traffic areas (including specialist ice cream bikes)
* Transporting trade tools, including around large installations such as power stations and CERN
* Airport cargo handling
* Recycling collections
* Warehouse inventory transportation
* Mail delivery (The UK post office operates a fleet of 33,000 bicycles, mainly the Pashley &quot;MailStar&quot;)

== Types ==
In Amsterdam and Copenhagen, cargo bikes are extremely popular. In Amsterdam many residents simply fit large front carriers to sturdy city bicycles. There is also a broad variety of specially made cargo bikes including low-loading two-wheelers with extended wheelbases, bicycles with small front wheels to fit huge front carriers, tadpole-type three-wheelers with a box between the two front wheels. Other varieties include a platform, basket etc. instead of the box, the loading area between two rear wheels (delta-fashion), small-wheel two-wheelers loading both back and front. An occasional four-wheeler can also be seen, especially within a plant, warehouse or the like, where demands on stability and loading capacity are higher than on range.

Many models are now available with an electric assist which can make them more useful for longer distances or for varied terrain, i.e. not flat cities, amongst other reasons, such as feeling more confident riding in car traffic due to faster acceleration from stopping.

=== Butcher&#x27;s bike ===
Also referred to as a Baker&#x27;s bike, although this style of cargo bike was popular with a wide variety of trades during the first half of the 20th century, particularly in the United Kingdom. Typically, they would have a basket or storage box mounted within a framework which was fixed to the frame (not the forks) of the bike. Often, they would also feature a sign advertising the business concerned, which would be attached within the main triangle of the bicycle frame.

The Schwinn Cycle Truck, produced in the USA between 1939 and 1967, also employed the same basket to frame arrangement.

=== Porteur bicycle ===
A porteur bicycle has the rack on the front, and can carry as much as that way.

=== Cycle truck ===
The cycle truck refers to a type of cargo bike with a smaller front wheel than rear, typically rear and front.

=== Boda-boda ===

A boda-boda (or bodaboda) is a two-wheeled bicycle or motorcycle taxi, originally in East Africa. Boda Boda is also the name of Yuba Bicycles compact cargo bike introduced in 2012.

===Stroller bike===
A cargo bicycle that converts into a stroller. Three wheels are used when the bike is in a stroller configuration, and two wheels are used when it is in a bike configuration with the cargo in front of the cyclist. This cargo bike can carry up to 100 lbs (45.4 kg). The stroller bike won the Gold Award at the Eurobike exhibition in 2018 as a special-purpose bike.

=== Long john bicycle ===
The long john bicycle is a cargo bike with the cargo area in front of the rider and some linkage connecting the steering to the front wheel, &quot;linkage steering&quot;. Capacity is usually about . A traditional long john will have a smaller front wheel and a rear wheel, plus a long platform, basket, or box located low, in front of the handlebars.

The term &quot;bakfiets&quot; (which literally means &quot;box bike&quot; in Dutch; plural is &quot;bakfietsen&quot;) is the Dutch word for cargo bikes in general. Bakfiets has traditionally mainly been used to refer to cargo tricycles with two front wheels, while the term &quot;Deense bakfiets&quot; (&quot;Danish cargo bike&quot;) is sometimes used to describe the Long John style of bicycle. 

Vintage long johns are becoming collectible. The last known manufacturer to still produce the original long john is Monark. The history of long john bicycles is traced to Denmark . The Smith &amp; Co. Company (SCO - founded by Ivar Smith and Robert Jacobsen in Odense, Denmark 17 October 1894) was the inventor and the first to build this type of cargo bicycle. The first Long-John was presented to the public at the Wembley World Fair &amp; Exhibition in 1924.

This style of bicycle is useful for carrying cargo, including children, and can function as a car replacement for many families. It is possible to install a carseat in the box to for babies, and when children get older, they are often seated on a small bench and clipped in with a 3- or 5-point harness. Canopies can be affixed to the cargo box for protection from the elements, making a warm and inviting space for children to enjoy the ride.

=== Longtail bicycle ===
Longtails have a longer frame wheelbase at the rear compared to a standard bicycle. The extended rear facilitates use as a cargo bike or carrying multiple or adult passengers compared with shorter bicycles. They tend to handle more like regular bikes than cargo bikes with linkage steering.

Xtracycle developed their first longtail product, their Free Radical, which attaches to an existing &#x27;donor&#x27; bicycle to make it a longtail bike in 1998. The growing popularity of Xtracycle inspired the Kona Ute, launched for the 2008 season. Surly were asked by Xtracycle to build a complete Xtracycle-compatible frameset; the result was the &#x27;Big Dummy&#x27;, first released for the 2008 season. The chromoly frameset is designed for wheels. Buyers have the choice of frameset alone or complete bicycle. In 2008 Xtracycle documented the &quot;LongTail&quot; as an open-source standard. This has helped individuals to build longtail bikes themselves such as the Xtravois.

There is a sub-class of longtail bicycles referred to as midtails. As their name implies, they are not quite as long as a longtail, but can still often carry at least one if not two children. The distinction between both is not clear and there are longer tailed bikes sold as midtail, while shorter are categorized as longtail.

=== Wooden cargo bike ===
The chukudu (or chikudu, cbokoudou) is a two-wheeled vehicle similar to a scooter used in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is made of wood, and used for transporting cargo.

=== Tricycle ===


Cycle rickshaws and other cargo tricycles are used for short range transport of both people and goods while tricycles with boxes or platforms are used to transport goods. A cargo tricycle with an open or flat platform might be used for low value goods or for trips where the rider is always with the goods. A fabric cover can be added to provide weather protection. Tricycles can also be fitted with a lockable weatherproof box, usually of aluminium construction, for valuable goods and where the rider has to leave the vehicle.

Cargo tricycles can typically carry of cargo and have capacity of or more, which is about half the capacity of a small panel van. The weight capacity of tricycles is limited by available human power and the permitted power of electric assist by law.

<doc id="289895" wikidata="Q127213" url="?curid=289895" title="Arboriculture">
<text>Arboriculture () is the cultivation, management, and study of individual trees, shrubs, vines, and other perennial woody plants. The science of arboriculture studies how these plants grow and respond to cultural practices and to their environment. The practice of arboriculture includes cultural techniques such as selection, planting, training, fertilization, pest and pathogen control, pruning, shaping, and removal.

== Overview ==

A person who practices or studies arboriculture can be termed an &quot;arborist&quot; or an &quot;arboriculturist&quot;. A &quot;tree surgeon&quot; is more typically someone who is trained in the physical maintenance and manipulation of trees and therefore more a part of the arboriculture process rather than an arborist. Risk management, legal issues, and aesthetic considerations have come to play prominent roles in the practice of arboriculture. Businesses often need to hire arboriculturists to complete &quot;tree hazard surveys&quot; and generally manage the trees on-site to fulfill occupational safety and health obligations.

Arboriculture is primarily focused on individual woody plants and trees maintained for permanent landscape and amenity purposes, usually in gardens, parks or other populated settings, by arborists, for the enjoyment, protection, and benefit of people.

Arboricultural matters are also considered to be within the practice of urban forestry yet the clear and separate divisions are not distinct or discreet.

== Tree Benefits ==
Tree benefits are the economic, ecological, social and aesthetic use, function purpose, or services of a tree (or group of trees), in its situational context in the landscape.

=== Environmental Benefits ===

* Erosion control and soil retention
* Improved water infiltration and percolation
* Protection from exposure: windbreak, shade, impact from hail/rainfall
* Air humidification
* Modulates environmental conditions in a given microclimate: shields wind, humidifies, provides shade
* Carbon sequestration and oxygen production

=== Ecological Benefits ===

* Attracting pollinators
* Increased biodiversity
* Food for decomposers, consumers, and pollinators
* Soil health: organic matter accumulation from leaf litter and root exudates (symbiotic microbes)
* Ecological habitat

=== Socioeconomic Benefits ===

* Increases employment: forestry, education, tourism
* Run-off and flood control (e.g. bioswales, plantings on slopes)
* Aesthetic beauty: parks, gatherings, social events, tourism, senses (fragrance, visual), focal point
* Adds character and prestige to the landscape, creating a &quot;natural&quot; feel
* Climate control (e.g shade): can reduce energy consumption of buildings
* Privacy and protection: from noise, wind
* Cultural benefits: eg. memorials for a loved one
* Medical benefits: eg. Taxus chemotherapy
* Materials: wood for building, paper pulp
* Fodder for livestock
* Property value: trees can increase by 10–20%
* Increases the amount of time customers will spend in a mall, strip mall, shopping district

== Tree Defects ==
A tree defect is any feature, condition, or deformity of a tree that indicates weak structure or instability that could contribute to tree failure.

Common types of tree defects:

Codominant stems: two or more stems that grow upward from a single point of origin and compete with one another.

* common with decurrent growth habits
* occurs in excurrent trees only after the leader is killed and multiple leaders compete for dominance

Included bark: bark is incorporated in the joint between two limbs, creating a weak attachment

* occurs in branch unions with a high attachment angle (i.e. v-shaped unions)
* common in many columnar/fastigiate growing deciduous trees

Dead, diseased, or broken branches:

* woundwood cannot grow over stubs or dead branches to seal off decay
* symptoms/signs of disease: e.g. oozing through the bark, sunken areas in the bark, and bark with abnormal patterns or colours, stunted new growth, discolouration of the foliage

Cracks

* longitudinal cracks result from interior decay, bark rips/tears, or torsion from wind load
* transverse cracks result from buckled wood, often caused by unnatural loading on branches, such as lion&#x27;s tailing.
* Seams: bark edges meet at a crack or wound
* Ribs: bulges, indicating interior cracks

Cavity and hollows: sunken or open areas wherein a tree has suffered injury followed by decay. Further indications include: fungal fruiting structures, insect or animal nests.

Lean: a lean of more than 40% from vertical presents a risk of tree failure

Taper: change in diameter over the length of trunks branches and roots

Epicormic branches (water sprouts in canopy or suckers from root system): often grow in response to major damage or excessive pruning

Roots:

* girdling roots compress the trunk, leading to poor trunk taper, and restrict vascular flow
* kinked roots provide poor structural support; the kink is a site of potential root failure
* circling roots occurs when roots encounter obstructions/limitations such as a small tree well or being grown too long in a nursery pot; these cannot provide adequate structural support and are limited in accessing nutrients and water
* healthy soil texture and depth, drainage, water availability, makes for healthy roots

== Tree Installation ==
Proper tree installation ensures the long-term viability of the tree and reduces the risk of tree failure. 

Quality nursery stock must be used. There must be no visible damage or sign of disease. Ideally the tree should have good crown structure. A healthy root ball should not have circling roots and new fibrous roots should be present at the soil perimeter. Girdling or circling roots should be pruned out. Excess soil above the root flare should be removed immediately, since it present a risk of disease ingress into the trunk.

Appropriate time of year to plant: generally fall or early spring in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.

Planting hole: the planting hole should be 3 times the width of the root ball. The hole should be dug deep enough that when the root ball is placed on the substrate, the root flare is 3–5cm above the surrounding soil grade. If soil is left against the trunk, it may lead to bark, cambium and wood decay. Angular sides to the planting hole will encourage roots to grow radially from the trunk, rather than circling the planting hole. In urban settings, soil preparation may include the use of:

* Silva cells: suspended pavement over modular cells containing soil for root development

* Structural soils: growing medium composed of 80% crushed rock and 20% loam, which supports surface load without it leading to soil compaction

Tree wells: a zone of mulch can be installed around the tree trunk to: limit root zone competition (from turf or weeds), reduce soil compaction, improve soil structure, conserve moisture, and keep lawn equipment at a distance. No more than 5–10cm of mulch should be used to avoid suffocating the roots. Mulch must be kept approximately 20cm from the trunk to avoid burying the root flare. With city trees additional tree well preparation includes:

Tree grates/grill and frames: limit compaction on root zone and mechanical damage to roots and trunk

Root barriers: forces roots to grow down under surface asphalt/concrete/pavers to limit infrastructure damage from roots

Staking: newly planted, immature trees should be staked for one growing season to allow for the root system to establish. Staking for longer than one season should only be considered in situations where the root system has failed to establish sufficient structural support. Guy wires can be used for larger, newly planted trees. Care must be used to avoid stem girdling from the support system ties.

Irrigation: irrigation infrastructure may be installed to ensure a regular water supply throughout the lifetime of the tree. Wicking beds are an underground reservoir from which water is wicked into soil. Watering bags may be temporarily installed around tree stakes to provide water until the root system becomes established. Permeable paving allows for water infiltration in paved urban settings, such as parks and walkways.

Within the United Kingdom trees are considered as a material consideration within the town planning system and may be conserved as amenity landscape features.

The role of the Arborist or Local Government Arboricultural Officer is likely to have a great effect on such matters. Identification of trees of high quality which may have extensive longevity is a key element in the preservation of trees.

Urban and rural trees may benefit from statutory protection under the Town and Country Planning system. Such protection can result in the conservation and improvement of the urban forest as well as rural settlements.

Historically the profession divides into the operational and professional areas. These might be further subdivided into the private and public sectors. The profession is broadly considered as having one trade body known as the Arboricultural Association, although the Institute of Chartered Foresters offers a route for professional recognition and chartered arboriculturist status.

The qualifications associated with the industry range from vocational to Doctorate. Arboriculture is a comparatively young industry.

<doc id="289896" wikidata="Q975637" url="?curid=289896" title="Kinjite">
<text>are various fouls that a sumo wrestler might commit that will cause him to lose the bout. They are:

* Striking the opponent with a closed fist.
* Grabbing the opponent&#x27;s hair.
* Jabbing at the opponent&#x27;s eyes or solar plexus.
* Simultaneously striking both of the opponent&#x27;s ears with the palms.
* Grabbing or pulling the opponent&#x27;s groin.
* Grabbing the opponent&#x27;s throat.
* Kicking at the opponent&#x27;s chest or waist.
* Bending back one or more of the opponent&#x27;s fingers.

Any of these is grounds for immediate disqualification (&quot;hansoku&quot;) owing to the potential for long-lasting harm to the wrestler involved. They are exceedingly rare and unlikely to be seen in the higher divisions of sumo, especially by the &quot;sekitori&quot; wrestlers. Additionally, if a wrestler&#x27;s mawashi becomes undone, they will be similarly disqualified.

Perhaps the most common &quot;kinjite&quot; committed is the grabbing of the opponent&#x27;s hair. Since it is tied up in a form of &quot;chonmage&quot; one&#x27;s hand can become inadvertently tangled in it during a bout. Itai pulled his opponent&#x27;s hair on two consecutive days when ranked in the &quot;jūryō&quot; division in May 1980. Other rikishi to have been disqualified in this way include &quot;ōzeki&quot; Daikirin and &quot;yokozuna&quot; Asashōryū in July 2003, &quot;ōzeki&quot; Tochinoshin in September 2019 and Terunofuji in May 2021.

Whilst grabbing the throat is not allowed, pushing the opponent backwards with an open hand against the throat (called a &quot;nodowa&quot;) is permitted, and is actually quite common.

In addition, there are moves that are permitted to professional &quot;rikishi&quot; and forbidden to more junior (school level) wrestlers. One such move is &quot;harite&quot; — slapping the opponent&#x27;s face with an open hand.

Kinjite also refers to an illegal move in shogi.

<text>Castlevania (), known in Japan as is a gothic horror action-adventure video game series and media franchise created by Konami. The series is largely set in the castle of Count Dracula, the arch-enemy of the Belmont clan of vampire hunters.

Debuting with the 1986 video game on Nintendo&#x27;s Famicom Disk System, the first entry and the majority of its sequels are side-scrolling action platformers. The 1997 game, &quot;&quot;, originally released for the PlayStation, returned to the nonlinear gameplay first seen in &quot;Castlevania II: Simon&#x27;s Quest,&quot; which also introduced role-playing elements and exploration. Several installments later adopted &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;″s gameplay, which along with &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, have popularized the Metroidvania genre. 2010 saw the release of &quot;&quot;, a 3D action-adventure game developed by MercurySteam and Kojima Productions that served as a reboot of the series.

The &quot;Castlevania&quot; series has been released on various platforms; from early systems to modern consoles, as well as handheld devices such as mobile phones. The franchise has since expanded into several spin-off video games and other media; including comic books and a critically-acclaimed animated television series.

Spanning almost four decades, &quot;Castlevania&quot; is one of Konami&#x27;s most successful and prominent franchises; several of its entries are ranked among the best video games ever made. Retrospectives attributed to the series&#x27; success to its unique blend of action, adventure, and horror elements; and it has been praised for its challenging gameplay mechanics, atmospheric settings, and iconic music.

==Games==

Most &quot;Castlevania&quot; titles have been released in Japan, North America, Europe and Australia on various video game consoles, personal computers (PC) and mobile phones, with additional remakes and re-releases.

The first console title, &quot;Castlevania&quot;, was released on the Famicom Disk System in 1986 and in North America in 1987 on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). A 2D sidescrolling action game where the player progresses through six stages, many principal features of the &quot;Castlevania&quot; series originated with it. It has been ported to many platforms, such as the NES Classic Edition. Also released in 1986 was &quot;Vampire Killer&quot; for the MSX home computer, which played significantly differently from the original &quot;Castlevania&quot;, where players had to search for the exit before they could proceed to the next stage. Following that year, in 1987, &quot;Castlevania II: Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot; further departed from the standard platforming genre of the first &quot;Castlevania&quot; for a game more similar to the nonlinear gameplay of &quot;Metroid&quot;, with several role-playing elements such as a world map which the player is free to explore and revisit.

&quot;Haunted Castle&quot; (1988), the franchise&#x27;s first arcade title, returned to the linear platforming gameplay of the original. This continued with the first handheld Game Boy entry, &quot;&quot; and the NES sequel, &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;, both released in 1989. &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot; added features to the original gameplay, including alternate stages and multiple playable characters. &quot;The Adventure&quot; saw a Game Boy sequel, &quot;Castlevania II: Belmont&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, in 1992 and a remake, &quot;&quot;, developed by M2 for the WiiWare service in 2009.

The franchise&#x27;s first 16-bit home console game, &quot;Super Castlevania IV&quot;, was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in 1991. A &quot;Castlevania&quot; title for the Sharp X68000 home computer was released in Japan in 1993 and would not be available in English until &quot;Castlevania Chronicles&quot; (2001) for the PlayStation. During the same year, &quot;&quot; was released for the PC Engine and was not localized in English until it was included with &quot;&quot; (2007) for the PlayStation Portable. The first &quot;Castlevania&quot; produced for a CD-ROM, &quot;Rondo of Blood&quot; featured Red Book audio and fully voiced dialogue. The game&#x27;s content would be reused in &quot;&quot;, a game for the SNES in 1995. &quot;&quot; (1994) was the first &quot;Castlevania&quot; entry produced for a Sega console, the Genesis. It would not be re-released until 2019 as part of the &quot;Castlevania Anniversary Collection&quot;.

In 1997, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Castlevania Legends&quot; were launched for the PlayStation and Game Boy, respectively. &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; introduced a major change to the gameplay, incorporating role-playing elements and a nonlinear map that the player could freely explore, which was previously seen in &quot;Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot; and Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Metroid&quot; series. Elements of &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; would influence the gameplay of future titles, beginning with the Game Boy Advance entries &quot;Circle of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Harmony of Dissonance&quot;, and &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot;, which were released from 2001 to 2003. &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot; received a 2005 sequel, for the Nintendo DS, which was followed by &quot;Portrait of Ruin&quot; (2006) and &quot;Order of Ecclesia&quot; (2008).

Under the development of Konami&#x27;s Kobe branch, the first game in the series to employ 3D graphics was &quot;Castlevania&quot; for Nintendo 64 in 1999, and it received an expansion called &quot;&quot; later that year. In 2003, the next 3D &quot;Castlevania&quot; title, &quot;Lament of Innocence&quot; debuted for the PlayStation 2 with combat-oriented hack and slash gameplay that drew comparisons to &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; and retroactively, &quot;God of War&quot;. It was followed two years later by &quot;&quot;.

A reboot of the franchise launched with &quot;&quot; in 2010, a multi-platform 3D action title developed by MercurySteam and co-produced by Hideo Kojima. It was followed by two sequels, &quot;&quot; for Nintendo 3DS in 2013, and &quot;Lords of Shadow 2&quot; in 2014. &quot;Lords of Shadow 2&quot; was the last mainline game in the franchise to date, due to Konami shifting focus to mobile games and gambling in the 2010s.

Rumors began circulating in 2021 that, following internal restructuring at Konami to refocus on PC and console games, a &quot;reimagining&quot; of the series was in development. In 2024, a remake of &quot;Haunted Castle&quot; was included in the compilation &quot;Castlevania Dominus Collection&quot;. Titled &quot;Haunted Castle Revisited&quot;, it was developed by M2, who previously worked on &quot;The Adventure ReBirth&quot;.

===Spin-offs===
&quot;Castlevania&quot; has spawned numerous spin-offs, the first being the 1990 platformer, &quot;Kid Dracula&quot; for the Famicom, a parody which stars the eponymous character. It was released for the first time in English for the &quot;Castlevania Anniversary Collection&quot; (2019). The game received a sequel for the Game Boy, also titled &quot;Kid Dracula&quot;.

&quot;Castlevania&quot;″s first fighting game, &quot;Castlevania Judgment&quot; debuted for the Wii in 2008 and was developed by Eighting. &quot;&quot;, released in 2010, was an online, multiplayer title in-which players could play as past &quot;Castlevania&quot; characters and explore stages. A mobile game called &quot;&quot; was released on September 19, 2019 for iOS through Apple Arcade.

Arcade and slot machines based on the series have been produced. &quot;&quot; (2009), a light gun shooter utilizing an LED remote, has been released in Japan and Europe. The Japanese-exclusive &quot;Pachislot Akumajō Dracula&quot; series is a line of pachislot titles released between 2009 and 2017. The first three are based on the video game &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;, while a fourth game based on the &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; reboot, &quot;Pachislot Akumajō Dracula: Lords of Shadow&quot;, was made available in 2017.

&quot;Castlevania&quot; characters and elements have appeared in crossovers and other titles such as the &quot;Konami Wai Wai World&quot; series, &quot;&quot;, &quot;DreamMix TV World Fighters&quot;, &quot;Bomberman R,&quot; &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, &quot;Dead Cells&quot;, and &quot;Vampire Survivors&quot;.

==Common elements==

===Gameplay===
&quot;Castlevania&quot;, released for the NES in 1986, is a platform game in which the player takes the role of the character Simon Belmont, navigating through six levels of Dracula&#x27;s castle. Each level is divided into six blocks of three stages each. He can navigate the castle&#x27;s terrain by jumping across platforms and walking up staircases, enabling him to progress to new stages. Simon has a health meter, which decreases upon contact with enemies or hazards. Loss of all health, falling off-screen, or running out of time results in losing a life, with the game ending when all lives are depleted, though players can continue from the last checkpoint. Collecting points throughout the levels can increase the player&#x27;s score and earn them additional lives. Each level culminates in a boss battle against one of Dracula&#x27;s monsters, each with their own life meter that needs to be depleted using Simon&#x27;s attacks. Simon wields the Vampire Killer whip, which can be improved by collecting upgrades hidden in candles. These upgrades extend the whip&#x27;s length and power, allowing Simon to attack enemies from a greater distance with increased damage. Alongside the whip, Simon can use secondary weapons like throwing knives, holy water, and the boomerang-like cross, which consume hearts collected throughout the levels.

While &quot;Castlevania&quot;&#x27;s gameplay set the standard for most titles, &quot;Castlevania II: Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot; in 1987 briefly introduced role-playing elements, a departure from the strict platforming format of its predecessor. Unlike the linear progression of the first game, &quot;Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot; allows players to explore a freely accessible world map, revisit areas, and engage with a dynamic environment that includes day and night cycles affecting enemy strength and the availability of non-playable characters. Players can interact with villagers who provide hints and visit merchants to buy items using hearts collected from defeated enemies. This installment also introduces experience points where Simon can increase his level and health capacity by gathering hearts. 1997&#x27;s &quot;Castlevania: Symphony of the Night&quot; significantly expanded upon the gameplay introduced in &quot;Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot;, setting a new formula for the series and influencing subsequent Metroidvania titles. &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; also features non-linear exploration, requiring players to gather specific items and abilities to access different areas of Dracula’s castle. This installment expanded the role-playing elements by including a more complex attribute and leveling system where the protagonist, Alucard, increases his in-game statistics by gaining experience points from defeated enemies. Alucard&#x27;s ability to transform into a bat, wolf, or mist also allows him to explore previously inaccessible areas, and he can also use a wider range of equipment.

The first 3D installment in the franchise, &quot;Castlevania&quot; (1999) on the Nintendo 64 adopted gameplay elements distinctly different from its 2D predecessors. Unlike earlier titles, this version implemented a basic targeting and lock-on system for combat for the two playable characters, Reinhardt and Carrie. The new environment itself played a crucial role in the gameplay, with challenges based on precision in jumping across 3D platforms and navigating through hazardous areas, some of which included rotating and crumbling platforms. &quot;Castlevania&quot; for the Nintendo 64 also incorporated elements of survival horror, such as a sequence where the player must run from a pursuing enemy in a hedge maze. Unlike the earlier 3D installment which involved navigating through various levels with a degree of platforming challenge, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Lament of Innocence&quot; focused on a central hub system. This hub allowed access to five main areas from the start, with progress tied to defeating bosses to unlock the final area. The combat system also allows the player to execute a series of fluid and dynamic combos using the primary weapon, the Whip of Alchemy. This system enables players to chain attacks into continuous strikes, enhancing combat engagement and effectiveness against enemies. The 2010 reboot, &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; introduced a more diverse range of up to forty unlockable combos with the game&#x27;s whip, the Combat Cross, integrating both direct and area attacks. Additionally, it functions as a tool for exploration, aiding in scaling walls, rappelling, and swinging across gaps, which deepens the platforming elements central to the franchise. Moreover, &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; features massive boss battles against titans, where players must use the Combat Cross to navigate and disable them.

The &quot;Castlevania&quot; franchise heavily references the horror films produced by Universal Pictures and Hammer Film Productions. Creator of the series, Hitoshi Akamatsu, wanted players to feel like they were in a classic horror film. Zombies, werewolves, Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, and Count Dracula make recurring appearances. Alucard, introduced in &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;, is a reference to the character of the same name from the 1943 film, &quot;Son of Dracula&quot;. The games include folklore and mythological monsters such as Medusa, as well as direct references to literary horror. &quot;&quot; explicitly incorporates the events of Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; into the series, and the recurring character Carmilla is based on the 1872 novel &quot;Carmilla&quot; by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu.

&quot;Castlevania&quot; mainly takes place in the castle of Count Dracula, who resurrects every hundred years to take over the world. With the exception of some games, the players assume the role of the Belmonts, a clan of vampire hunters who have defeated Dracula for centuries with the Vampire Killer. The Vampire Killer is a legendary whip that is passed down to their successors and can only be used by them. In &quot;Castlevania: Bloodlines&quot;, the whip has been inherited by John Morris, the son of Quincey Morris, who is a distant descendant of the Belmonts. Other recurring characters throughout the series include the dhampir Alucard, who sides with Trevor Belmont against his father Dracula in &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot;. Trevor is joined by Sypha Belnades, a vampire hunter who fights using magic and marries Trevor by the end of the game. Descendants of the Belnades clan, such as Carrie Fernandez and Yoko Belnades, would make appearances as playable characters in later titles.

&quot;&quot; is a reboot of the franchise, with its first game set in Southern Europe during the Middle Ages. The main character, Gabriel Belmont, is a member of the Brotherhood of Light, an elite group of holy knights who defend people from supernatural creatures. With a retractable chain whip called the Combat Cross, Gabriel fights a malevolent force known as the Lords of Shadow in order to obtain the God Mask, which he believes can bring back his deceased wife. In &quot;&quot;, Gabriel stars as Dracula, the main antagonist of Simon and Trevor Belmont. The sequel, &quot;&quot; is set during modern times, where Dracula is looking for a way to put an end to his immortality.

In 2002, the games &quot;Legends&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Castlevania&quot; (1999), and &quot;&quot; were retconned from the official chronology by Koji Igarashi, a move which had been met with some criticism by fans. Igarashi noted that &quot;Legends&quot; conflicted with the plotline of the series, and that the reason for &quot;Circle of the Moon&quot;″s removal was not due to his non-involvement with the game, but instead the intention of the game&#x27;s development team for &quot;Circle of the Moon&quot; to be a stand-alone title. The American 20th Anniversary Pre-order Bundle for &quot;&quot; in 2006 featured a poster with a timeline that re-included the games other than &quot;Legends&quot;. In 2007, Konami still excluded them from the canon on the official Japanese website. Igarashi has said that he considered the titles a &quot;subseries&quot;.

==Development==
&quot;Castlevania&quot; was directed and programmed by Hitoshi Akamatsu for the Family Computer Disk System in 1986. The game&#x27;s staff roll features names taken from horror film icons, with Akamatsu being credited as &#x27;Trans Fishers&#x27;, a reference to film director Terence Fisher. This is possibly because Konami did not allow the use of real names at the time in order to prevent other companies from hiring people who worked for them. An admirer of cinema, Akamatsu approached projects with a &quot;film director&#x27;s eye&quot;, and said the visuals and music for &quot;Castlevania&quot; were &quot;made by people who consciously wanted to do something cinematic.&quot; The protagonist Simon Belmont uses a whip because Akamatsu liked the mechanics of a weapon able to repel enemies, and also because Akamatsu was a fan of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. After the success of &quot;Castlevania&quot;, it was released in cartridge format for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) as one of its first major platform games. The international title &quot;Castlevania&quot; was the result of Konami of America senior vice president Emil Heidkamp&#x27;s discomfort with &quot;Akumajō Dracula&quot;, which he believed translated as &quot;Dracula Satanic Castle&quot;. Because of Nintendo of America&#x27;s censorship policies at the time, most instances of blood, nudity and religious imagery were removed or edited in early &quot;Castlevania&quot; games.

Akamatsu directed &quot;Castlevania II: Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot; in 1987, which adopted gameplay similar to Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Metroid&quot;. When asked if &quot;Metroid&quot; had any inspiration, Akamatsu instead cited &quot;Maze of Galious&quot;, another Konami title which featured exploration and puzzle solving. His last game in the series, &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot; (1989), returned to the standard platforming genre of &quot;Castlevania&quot;. Since Konami&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; games sold many copies, their development was prioritized above other titles, leading the developers for &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot; to make a game that would outdo them. &quot;Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot; and &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot; were not a commercial success, and Akamatsu was demoted to working in one of Konami&#x27;s game centers before he chose to resign.

In 1993, three &quot;Castlevania&quot; games were in parallel development, which included &quot;Akumajō Dracula&quot;, &quot;Rondo of Blood&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Directed and produced by Toru Hagihara, &quot;Rondo of Blood&quot; was the first installment made for a CD-ROM and the first to be fully voiced. Hagihara would go on to direct a sequel, &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; (1997) for the PlayStation, with Koji Igarashi joining him as the assistant director and story writer. Joining the staff was artist Ayami Kojima, who was hired to introduce a new look for &quot;Castlevania&quot;. She would be the character designer for several future &quot;Castlevania&quot; titles. Igarashi said it began development as &quot;something of a side story series&quot;. From the outset, the game was supposed to take the franchise in a new direction. The gameplay took a departure from the original platforming entries, instead adopting nonlinear exploration and role-playing game elements, which were last seen in &quot;Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot;. The critical reaction to &quot;Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot; and its gameplay allowed them to pitch &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; to Konami. Igarashi was eventually asked to finish the game as the assistant director after Hagihara was promoted to head of the division. On release, &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; was well-received and became a sleeper hit, but its commercial performance was mediocre, particularly in the United States where it was meagerly publicized.
The first &quot;Castlevania&quot; game to feature 3D computer graphics began development in 1997 on the Nintendo 64 by Konami Computer Entertainment Kobe (KCEK) as &quot;Dracula 3D&quot;. Like most of its predecessors, it was an action-adventure and platforming game. It was eventually released as &quot;Castlevania&quot; in 1999 and received an expanded version titled &quot;&quot; during the same year. KCEK&#x27;s last &quot;Castlevania&quot; game was the acclaimed &quot;&quot;, released as a launch title for the Game Boy Advance in 2001. &quot;Circle of the Moon&quot; was the first entry to feature Metroidvania gameplay since &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;. Igarashi, who was not involved with the game, was critical of &quot;Circle of the Moon&quot;. In 2002, he retconned &quot;Castlevania Legends&quot; (1997) and the games developed by KCEK from the series&#x27; chronology due to story conflicts, which was met with some resistance from fans. After KCEK was dissolved during 2002, the Game Boy Advance received a second installment, &quot;&quot;, now produced by Igarashi and developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo (KCET). Starting with &quot;Harmony of Dissonance&quot;, the Japanese games adopted &quot;Castlevania&quot; as the title for a brief period. According to Igarashi, the developers did this since Count Dracula is not always the main antagonist. This continued with &quot;&quot; (2003), a 3D title developed as a new starting point for the series. Konami eventually returned to the title &quot;Akumajō Dracula&quot; with the Japanese release of 2005&#x27;s &quot;&quot; for the Nintendo DS. &quot;Dawn of Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Portrait of Ruin&quot; (2006) introduced a new art style in hopes of broadening the player demographic and preventing younger Nintendo DS owners from being put off by Ayami Kojima&#x27;s art. This discontinued with &quot;&quot; in 2008.

Due to concern over the poor sales of the recent &quot;Castlevania&quot; games, a number of prototypes in development competed to become the next &quot;Castlevania&quot; installment, which included a game by Igarashi announced at Tokyo Game Show 2008 and &quot;&quot; by Spanish studio MercurySteam. Konami told MercurySteam the game would be an original intellectual property (IP) when it was first greenlit as a &quot;Castlevania&quot; title. Konami eventually asked them to cease work on &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; while it was still in its early stages, until producer David Cox showed the Japanese senior management the game and was offered help by video game designer Hideo Kojima. According to Igarashi, development on his project had not been going smoothly, and Konami had canceled it and chose &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; as the pitch for the next &quot;Castlevania&quot; entry. Produced by Dave Cox and Hideo Kojima, &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; was a multi-platform 3D action-adventure reboot of the series. Kojima offered his input on the project and also oversaw the game&#x27;s localization in Japan. It was the first &quot;Castlevania&quot; to feature celebrity voice talent, starring Robert Carlyle in the lead role and Patrick Stewart. The art style departed from the previous games in favor of one inspired by Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s work. &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; was met with positive reception in 2010 and a commercial success, becoming the best selling &quot;Castlevania&quot; game to date. It was followed by two sequels, &quot;&quot; (2013) and &quot;&quot; (2014). &quot;Lords of Shadow 2&quot; was not as well received as its predecessor. Following its release, an anonymous source claiming to be employees from MercurySteam alleged that development on the game had been troubled.

After having been moved to Konami&#x27;s social division in 2011, Igarashi felt he was unable to release any new games when Konami shifted its focus towards mobile game development. He left in March 2014 to independently create &quot;&quot;, a spiritual successor to &quot;Castlevania&quot;. Dave Cox followed Igarashi&#x27;s resignation a few months later. Recent &quot;Castlevania&quot; titles released under Konami&#x27;s recent business model include pachinko and slot machines based on the IP.

===Audio===
&quot;Castlevania&quot;&#x27;s music features a wide range of compositions, with themes reused throughout the series. It has been critically acclaimed and released on many albums, initially under the King Records label. In addition to original soundtracks, it has also inspired remix albums, which include orchestra, rap and heavy metal arrangements. In 2010, &quot;Castlevania – The Concert&quot; was performed in Stockholm, Sweden by longtime &quot;Castlevania&quot; composer, Michiru Yamane, and the Stockholm Youth Symphonic Orchestra.

The music for the first installment, &quot;Castlevania&quot;, was composed by Kinuyo Yamashita and Satoe Terashima. The game&#x27;s staff roll featured pseudonyms, with Yamashita credited as James Banana. Yamashita said she did not know anything about video games at the time and composed for &quot;Castlevania&quot; shortly after graduating from college. Under strict hardware constraints, she would first write the scores before entering it as data into a computer. The hardware for the first 16-bit title, &quot;Super Castlevania IV&quot;, allowed for a more atmospheric environment in the game, and was composed by Masanori Adachi and Taro Kudo.

Known primarily for her work on the &quot;Castlevania&quot; series, Michiru Yamane first composed music for the Sega Genesis game, &quot;&quot;. Yamane was under pressure at the time because the series was already popular and known for its music. She felt there was a link with the game&#x27;s vampiric themes and the classical music she had grown up with, having studied Johann Sebastian Bach in university, and worked to integrate her style with the rock themes of the previous games. Since &quot;&quot;, Yamane became involved with the development of the series with its former producer, Koji Igarashi. &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot;&#x27;s art director, Osamu Kasai, requested Yamane to join the team, and she would draw inspiration from Ayami Kojima&#x27;s concept artwork. Unlike the FM synthesis that &quot;Bloodlines&quot; used, Yamane felt she had more freedom with &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; as it was produced for a CD-ROM, which made it capable of much higher quality music and sound. She continued to compose for the series, including the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS games, which had note limitations like older home consoles, and also collaborated with other composers such as Yuzo Koshiro. Before becoming a freelance composer, the last &quot;Castlevania&quot; game she scored was &quot;&quot; in 2008, which she worked on with Yasuhiro Ichihashi.

For the 2010 reboot, &quot;&quot;, the game was scored by Óscar Araujo using a 120-piece orchestra. His work on &quot;Lords of Shadow&quot; earned him a nomination for breakout composer of the year by the International Film Music Critics Association, and he won &quot;Best Original Score for a Video Game or Interactive Media.&quot; Araujo went on to compose the sequels, &quot;Mirror of Fate&quot; and &quot;Lords of Shadow 2&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==

The &quot;Castlevania&quot; franchise had sold over 20 million copies worldwide ; it had previously sold over units by 1993. The franchise has received mostly positive reviews, with the most acclaimed game being &quot;&quot; for the PlayStation and the most panned being &quot;Judgment&quot;, with aggregate scores of 93 and 49, respectively, on Metacritic and 93.38% and 52.71%, respectively, on GameRankings.

Many of the games have appeared on lists of video games considered to be the best. &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; appeared at #16 on &quot;IGN&quot; &quot;Top 100 games&quot; and was one of the first to be introduced on the &quot;GameSpot&quot; &quot;The Greatest Games of All Time&quot;. Both acclaimed the game to successfully making a game in 2D while the industry was moving to 3D. &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot; was named the 9th best 8-bit game by &quot;GameTrailers&quot;. &quot;Super Castlevania IV&quot; was named the 11th best game of the SNES by &quot;ScrewAttack&quot; on their &quot;Top 20 SNES Games&quot;. The series as a whole was named the 4th best franchise in games ever by &quot;IGN&quot;, behind only &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;Mario&quot;, and citing &quot;Super Castlevania IV&quot; and &quot;Symphony of the Night&quot; as highlights. &quot;Aria of Sorrow&quot; was named the 2nd best game on the Game Boy Advance and one of the must buys for the system, according to the same website. &quot;Castlevania&quot;, &quot;Super Castlevania IV&quot;, and &quot;&quot; appeared on &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s &quot;Top 200 Games&quot; list. Trivia about the series has been mentioned in the &quot;Guinness World Records: Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008&quot;.

==In other media==
Simon Belmont was one of the stars in the animated series &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;. Simon is portrayed as egotistical on the show and his physical appearance differs from his design in the video game series. He was a member of the N-Team, a group of mostly video game characters who defended Videoland against the antagonist Mother Brain from &quot;Metroid&quot;. Dracula, referred to only as &quot;the Count&quot;, appeared as a villain in &quot;Captain N&quot;. Alucard also appeared in one episode, though he was portrayed as a rebellious skateboarding teenager.

Several novels and comic book adaptations have been made. &quot;Worlds of Power&quot;, a 1990s series of books with stories based on Nintendo games, featured a novel about &quot;Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot; written by Christopher Howell, and the series was produced by Seth Godin. It departs from the original plot and introduces characters not seen in the game, including junior high school student Timothy Bradley, a video gamer who crosses over into the world of &quot;Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot; and assists Simon Belmont. In 2005, IDW Publishing released the graphic novel &quot;Castlevania: The Belmont Legacy&quot;, based on &quot;&quot;, written by Marc Andreyko with art by E. J. Su. Illustrated by Kou Sasakura, a two-volume manga adaptation titled &quot;Castlevania: Curse of Darkness&quot;, based on the PlayStation 2 installment, was published in Japan from 2005 to 2006. It was released in English in 2008. 2003&#x27;s &quot;Lament of Innocence&quot; was adapted into a cellphone comic book, released exclusively in Japan from 2007–2008 for 40 episodes.

The franchise has its own toy line manufactured by NECA which consists of six figures of Simon Belmont, Alucard, Dracula, Succubus and a Pixel Simon mini figure which was exclusively available as a promotional item at Comic-Con 2007.

===TV series===
The streaming service Netflix released an American animated series titled &quot;Castlevania&quot; as part of its original programming between 2017 and 2021, consisting of four seasons and 32 episodes. The first two seasons adapt elements from &quot;Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse&quot; and follow Trevor Belmont, Alucard and Sypha Belnades as they defend the nation of Wallachia from Dracula while later seasons include elements from other games such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The series was created by Warren Ellis; in developing the series, Ellis relied heavily on a script he had written for an animated Castlevania film from 2007 that never entered production. The art style of the series is influenced by anime and the artwork of Ayami Kojima, with animation provided by Frederator Studios and Powerhouse Animation Studios.

A sequel to the original show, &quot;&quot;, was released on Netflix on September 28, 2023. It focuses on Richter Belmont, a descendent of Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, and Maria Renard in France during the French Revolution, 300 years after the original series. The series adapts elements from &quot;&quot;. The second season premiered on January 16, 2025. Original series creator Warren Ellis was not involved in the new series after sexual misconduct allegations surfaced in 2020.

===Cancelled projects===

A &quot;Castlevania&quot; television series was considered in the late 1980s as part of the &quot;Super Mario Bros. Power Hour&quot;, a one-hour animation block of Nintendo-focused video game adaptations. Concept art was produced for the project by DIC Animation City. Only the Mario and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; segments for the block were ultimately produced, airing in 1989 as part of &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot;.

A &quot;Castlevania&quot; film was planned in the late 2000s. However, in December 2007, Rogue Pictures halted active development of &quot;Castlevania&quot; due to the writers&#x27; strike and, later, the sale of the studio to Relativity Media and possibility of a screen actors&#x27; guild strike. On May 27, 2009, the &quot;Castlevania&quot; film was reported as officially canceled.

<doc id="289903" wikidata="Q333739" url="?curid=289903" title="Qassam rocket">
<text>The Qassam rocket ( ; also &quot;Kassam&quot;) is a simple, steel artillery rocket developed and deployed by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of Hamas. These rockets cannot be fired to target specific military objectives in or near civilian areas, and are &quot;indiscriminate when used against targets in population centers&quot;.

Since the rocket was first manufactured in 2001 by Tito Masoud and Nidal Farhat, three models of the Qassam rocket have been produced and used. More generally, all types of Palestinian rockets fired into southern Israel, for example the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Al Quds rockets, are called Qassams by the Israeli media, and often by foreign media.

Leading international human rights organizations have called Palestinian armed groups&#x27; use of Qassam rockets against civilian and civilian targets a war crime and a violation of international law.

Many of the rocket&#x27;s components are made of common materials such as sugar, fertilizer, firearms cartridges, springs, nails, and steel cylinders.

==History==
===Name===
Qassam rockets are named after the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the armed branch of Hamas, itself named for Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, a Syrian Muslim preacher whose death during a guerrilla raid against British Mandatory authorities in 1935 was one of the catalysts for the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine.

===Manufacture and deployment===
Tito Masoud and Nidal Farhat manufactured the first Qassam-1 rocket, with a 2,500m range, in June 2001. This development in rocket manufacturing and development was a turning point in the war between Palestinian armed factions and Israel. The first Qassam produced was the Qassam-1, with a maximum range of .

Hamas launched the first Qassam-1 rocket attack in October 2001, during the Second Intifada. The first time Palestinians launched rockets into Israel, rather than at an Israeli settlement in the Gaza Strip, occurred on February 10, 2002. One of the rockets landed in Kibbutz Saad. Two Qassam rockets landed in the southern Israeli city of Sderot, the first city hit, on March 5, 2002. Some rockets have hit as far as the edge of Ashkelon. By the end of December 2008, a total of 15 people had been killed by Palestinian rockets since attacks began in 2001. Since 2000, Palestinian rockets, which include the Qassam, alongside others such as the Grad rocket, have been used to kill 22 Israeli citizens and one Thai national (as of January 9, 2009).

==Rocket, design and cost==
===Rocket===

The Qassam rocket is the best-known type of rocket deployed by Palestinian militants, mainly against Israeli civilians, but also some military targets during the Second Intifada of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. According to Human Rights Watch, Qassam rockets are too inaccurate and prone to malfunction to be used against specific military targets in or near civilian areas, and are mainly launched for the purpose of &quot;harming civilians&quot;.

===Design===
The utility of the Qassam rocket design is assumed to be ease and speed of manufacture, using common tools and components. To this end, the rockets are propelled by a solid mixture of sugar and potassium nitrate, a common fertilizer. The warhead is filled with smuggled or scavenged TNT and urea nitrate, another common fertilizer. The warhead&#x27;s explosive material is similar to the civilian explosive ammonite.

The rocket consists of a steel cylinder, containing a rectangular block of the propellant. A steel plate which forms and supports the nozzles is then spot-welded to the base of the cylinder. The warhead consists of a simple metal shell surrounding the explosives, and is triggered by a fuse constructed using a simple firearm cartridge, spring and a nail.

Early designs used a single nozzle which screwed into the base; later rockets use a seven-nozzle design, with the nozzles drilled directly into the rocket baseplate. This alteration both increases the tolerance of the rocket to small nozzle design defects, and makes manufacture easier by allowing the use of a drill rather than a lathe during manufacture (because of the smaller nozzle size). Unlike many other rockets, the nozzles are not canted, which means the rocket does not spin about its longitudinal axis during flight. While this results in a significant decrease in accuracy, it greatly simplifies manufacture and the launch systems required.

=== Cost ===
The cost of the materials used for manufacturing each Qassam was up to $800 or €500 per rocket in 2009.

==Reactions==
===Israeli ===

The introduction of the Qassam rocket was unexpected by Israeli politicians and military experts, and reactions have been mixed. In 2006, the Israeli Ministry of Defense viewed the Qassams as &quot;more a psychological than physical threat.&quot; A 2008 study found that over half of Sderot&#x27;s residents have been hurt, either physically or psychologically, by the use of Qassams. The Israel Defense Forces has reacted to the deployment of the Qassam rockets by deploying the Red Color early warning system in Sderot, Ashkelon, and other potential targets placed at risk. The system consists of an advanced radar that detects rockets as they are being launched, and loudspeakers warn civilians to take cover between 15 and 45 seconds before impact in an attempt to minimize the threat posed by the rockets. A system called Iron Dome, designed to intercept the rockets before they can hit their targets, has been in use since March 2011. A system based on lasers (Nautilios) was researched in a joint Israeli-American project in the early 2000s, but was discontinued.

An online clock timer, developed by Aaron Friedman and Yehonatan Tsirolnik, that automatically resets when Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel occur uses information from the IDF Home Front Command system and counts time up from the last Palestinian rocket attack on Israel. It displays how long Israel has been rocket-free and shows the summed-up total numbers of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel. &quot;Israel has been under non-stop rocket attacks for years (..) Whenever a rocket is fired, it restarts. Sadly, this counter never really gets above an hour&quot;, Friedman said on July 18, 2014, during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. An amateur YouTube video, showing the Israeli Iron Dome defense system at a military checkpoint near a crossing into Gaza taking out multiple Qassam rockets was uploaded in 2014.

===Palestinian ===
In 2012, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas stated &quot;There is no justification for rockets from Gaza or anywhere else,&quot; adding that &quot;Rocket attacks are in vain because they do not bring peace any closer.&quot;

Ibrahim Khreisheh, the Palestinian envoy to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), stated in an PA TV interview on July 9, 2014 (translated by MEMRI) that indiscriminate Hamas rockets from densely populated residential areas are &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;, while Israeli strikes are legal responses.

===Human rights groups===
Amnesty International labeled Palestinian groups&#x27; use of rockets during the 2014 Gaza war as a &quot;war crime&quot;, stating that &quot;Palestinian armed groups operating in the Gaza Strip fired thousands of indiscriminate rockets and mortars into Israel; firing munitions which cannot be aimed accurately into civilian areas is a war crime, and statements by Hamas and Palestinian armed groups also indicates that some attacks were intended to kill or injure civilians.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MDE 15/017/2014&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty additionally &quot;has documented that Palestinian armed groups have stored munitions in and fired indiscriminate rockets from residential areas in the Gaza Strip, and available evidence indicates that they continue to do both during the current hostilities, in violation of international humanitarian law (..) Under international humanitarian law, (..) Parties to the conflict must also take necessary precautions to protect civilians in their power from the effects of attack. This includes avoiding, to the maximum extent feasible, co-locating military objectives in the vicinity of densely populated civilian neighbourhoods. This means the parties should avoid endangering civilians by storing ammunition in, and launching attacks from, populated civilian areas.&quot;

Human Rights Watch has called the use of Qassam rockets by Hamas against civilians and civilian targets illegal under international law. In a 2005 statement, the group said that &quot;such weapons are therefore indiscriminate when used against targets in population centers. The absence of Israeli military forces in the areas where rockets have hit, as well as statements by leaders of Palestinian armed groups that population centers were being targeted, indicate that the armed groups deliberately attacked Israeli civilians and civilian objects.&quot; In another 2005 statement, the group noted that as the ruling authority of Gaza, Hamas was obligated to uphold the laws of war and should appropriately punish those responsible for serious violations&quot;. The international community considers indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian structures that do not discriminate between civilians and military targets as illegal under international law.

==Similar Palestinian rockets==

Other Palestinian militant groups have also developed home-made rockets. The media generally refer to all Palestinian high-trajectory rockets as &quot;Qassam rockets&quot; or &quot;Qassam missiles&quot;, while they call most rockets fired from Lebanon &quot;Katyushas&quot;, as a Katyusha is not a specific model but rather a generic class of rocket.

<text>Kaloyan or Kalojan, also known as Ivan I, Ioannitsa or Johannitsa (; 1170 – October 1207), the Roman Slayer, was emperor or tsar of Bulgaria from 1196 to 1207. He was the younger brother of Theodor and Asen, who led the anti-Byzantine uprising of the Bulgarians and Vlachs in 1185. The uprising ended with the restoration of Bulgaria as an independent state. He spent a few years as a hostage in Constantinople in the late 1180s. Theodor, crowned Emperor Peter II, made him his co-ruler after Asen was murdered in 1196. A year later, Peter was also murdered, and Kaloyan became the sole ruler of Bulgaria.

After the successful siege of Varna in 1201 against the Byzantine Empire, the defenders and governors of the city were tied and thrown into the moat of the fortress walls and covered with dirt by the Bulgarians. After they were buried alive in this way, Kaloyan declared himself a Bulgarian avenger, adopting the moniker &quot;the Romanslayer&quot; by analogy with the emperor Basil II the Bulgar Slayer, who blinded an entire Bulgarian army of 15,000 people.

To obtain an imperial title from the Holy See, Kaloyan entered into correspondence with Pope Innocent III, offering to acknowledge papal primacy. His expansionist policy brought him into conflict with the Byzantine Empire, Hungary, and Serbia. In 1204, King Emeric of Hungary allowed the papal legate who was to deliver a royal crown to Kaloyan to enter Bulgaria only at the Pope&#x27;s demand. The legate crowned Kaloyan &quot;king of the Bulgarians and Vlachs&quot; on 8 November 1204, but Kaloyan continued to style himself as tsar (emperor).

Kaloyan took advantage of the disintegration of the Byzantine Empire after the fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders or &quot;Latins&quot; in 1204. He captured fortresses in the themes of Macedonia and Thrace and supported the local population&#x27;s riots against the Crusaders. He defeated Baldwin I, Latin Emperor of Constantinople, in the Battle of Adrianople on 14 April 1205. Baldwin was captured and later died in Kaloyan&#x27;s prison. Kaloyan launched new campaigns against the Crusaders and Romans, capturing or destroying dozens of their fortresses. He died under mysterious circumstances during the siege of Thessalonica in 1207.

== Early life ==

Kaloyan was the younger brother of Theodor and Asen, noted as the instigators of the uprising of the Bulgarians and Vlachs against the Byzantine Empire in 1185. Theodor was crowned emperor and adopted the name Peter in 1185. Asen became Peter&#x27;s co-ruler before 1190. They secured the independence of their realm with the assistance of Cuman warriors from the Pontic steppes.

Kaloyan, who was still a teenager in 1188, must have been born around 1170, according to historian Alexandru Madgearu. He was baptised Ivan (or John), but he was called Johannitsa (&quot;Little Ivan&quot;) because Ivan was also the baptismal name of his elder brother Asen. Kaloyan derived from the Greek expression for John the Handsome &quot;(Kallos Ioannis)&quot;. His Greek enemies also called him &quot;Skyloioannes&quot; (&quot;John the Dog&quot;), which gave rise to references to &quot;Tsar Skaloyan&quot; or &quot;Scaluian&quot; in frescos in the Dragalevtsi Monastery and the Sucevița Monastery.

After the Byzantines captured Asen&#x27;s wife, Kaloyan was sent as a hostage to Constantinople in exchange for her in the spring of 1188. The date of his release is not known, or said to be about 1189 when he escaped. He was back in his homeland when a boyar, Ivanko, murdered Asen in Tarnovo in 1196. Ivanko attempted to obtain the throne with Byzantine support, but Theodor-Peter forced him to flee to the Byzantine Empire.

== Reign ==

=== Conflicts with the Byzantine Empire ===

The Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates mentioned that Theodor-Peter designated Kaloyan &quot;to assist him in his labors and share in his rule&quot; at an unspecified time. Kaloyan became the sole ruler of Bulgaria after Theodor-Peter was murdered in 1197. Shortly afterwards he attacked the Byzantine province of Thrace and launched frequent raids against it during the following months. Around this time, he sent a letter to Pope Innocent III, urging him to dispatch an envoy to Bulgaria. He wanted to persuade the pope to acknowledge his rule in Bulgaria. Innocent eagerly entered into correspondence with Kaloyan because the reunification of the Christian denominations under his authority was one of his principal objectives.

The Byzantine Emperor Alexios III Angelos made Ivanko the commander of Philippopolis (now Plovdiv in Bulgaria). Ivanko seized two fortresses in the Rhodopi Mountains from Kaloyan, but by 1198 he had made an alliance with him. Cumans and Vlachs from the lands to the north of the river Danube broke into the Byzantine Empire in the spring and autumn of 1199. Choniates, who recorded these events, did not mention that Kaloyan cooperated with the invaders, so it is likely that they crossed Bulgaria without his authorization. Kaloyan captured Braničevo, Velbuzhd (now Kyustendil in Bulgaria), Skopje and Prizren from the Byzantines, most probably in that year, according to historian Alexandru Madgearu.

Innocent III&#x27;s envoy arrived in Bulgaria in late December 1199, bringing a letter from the Pope to Kaloyan. Innocent stated that he was informed that Kaloyan&#x27;s forefathers had come &quot;from the City of Rome&quot;. Kaloyan&#x27;s answer, written in Old Church Slavonic, has not been preserved, but its content can be reconstructed based on his later correspondence with the Holy See. Kaloyan styled himself &quot;Emperor of the Bulgarians and Vlachs&quot;, and asserted that he was the legitimate successor of the rulers of the First Bulgarian Empire. He demanded an imperial crown from the Pope and expressed his wish to put the Bulgarian Orthodox Church under the pope&#x27;s jurisdiction.

The Byzantines captured Ivanko and occupied his lands in 1200. Kaloyan and his Cuman allies launched a new campaign against Byzantine territories in March 1201. He destroyed Constantia (now Simeonovgrad in Bulgaria) and captured Varna. He also supported the rebellion of Dobromir Chrysos and Manuel Kamytzes against Alexios III, but they were both defeated. Roman Mstislavich, prince of Halych and Volhynia, invaded the Cumans&#x27; territories, forcing them to return to their homeland in 1201. After the Cuman&#x27;s retreat, Kaloyan concluded a peace treaty with Alexios III and withdrew his troops from Thrace in late 1201 or in 1202. According to Kaloyan&#x27;s letter to the Pope, Alexios III was also willing to send an imperial crown to him and to acknowledge the autocephalous (or autonomous) status of the Bulgarian Church.

=== Imperial ambitions ===

Vukan Nemanjić, ruler of Zeta, expelled his brother, Stefan, from Serbia in 1202. Kaloyan gave shelter to Stefan and allowed the Cumans to invade Serbia across Bulgaria. He invaded Serbia himself and captured Niš in the summer of 1203. According to Madgearu he also seized Dobromir Chrysos&#x27;s realm, including its capital at Prosek. Emeric, King of Hungary, who claimed Belgrade, Braničevo and Niš, intervened in the conflict on Vukan&#x27;s behalf. The Hungarian army occupied territories which were also claimed by Kaloyan. Since Vukan had already acknowledged papal primacy, Innocent III urged Kaloyan to make peace with him in September. In the same month, the papal legate, John of Casamari, gave a pallium to Basil I, the head of the Bulgarian Church, confirming his rank of archbishop, but denying his elevation to the rank of patriarch.

Dissatisfied with the Pope&#x27;s decision, Kaloyan sent a new letter to Rome, asking Innocent to send cardinals who could crown him emperor. He also informed the Pope that Emeric of Hungary had seized five Bulgarian bishoprics, asking Innocent to arbitrate in the dispute and determine the boundary between Bulgaria and Hungary. In the letter, he styled himself the &quot;Emperor of the Bulgarians&quot;. The Pope did not accept Kaloyan&#x27;s claim to an imperial crown, but dispatched Cardinal Leo Brancaleoni to Bulgaria in early 1204 to crown him king.

Kaloyan sent envoys to the crusaders who were besieging Constantinople, offering military support to them if &quot;they would crown him king so that he would be lord of his land of Vlachia&quot;, according to Robert of Clari&#x27;s chronicle. However, the crusaders treated him with disdain and did not accept his offer. The crusaders captured Constantinople on 13April. They elected Baldwin IX of Flanders emperor and agreed to divide the Byzantine Empire among themselves.

The papal legate, Brancaleoni, travelled through Hungary, but he was arrested at Keve (now Kovin in Serbia) on the Hungarian–Bulgarian frontier. Emeric of Hungary urged the cardinal to summon Kaloyan to Hungary and to arbitrate in their conflict. Brancaleoni was only released at the Pope&#x27;s demand in late September or early October. He consecrated Basil primate of the Church of the Bulgarians and Vlachs on 7November. Next day, Brancaleone crowned Kaloyan king. In his subsequent letter to the Pope, Kaloyan styled himself as &quot;King of Bulgaria and Vlachia&quot;, but referred to his realm as an empire and to Basil as a patriarch.

=== War with the Crusaders ===

Taking advantage of the disintegration of the Byzantine Empire, Kaloyan captured former Byzantine territories in Thrace. Initially he attempted to secure a peaceful division of the lands with the crusaders (or &quot;Latins&quot;). He asked Innocent III to prevent them from attacking Bulgaria. However, the crusaders wanted to implement their treaty which divided the Byzantine territories between them, including lands that Kaloyan claimed.

Kaloyan gave shelter to Byzantine refugees and persuaded them to stir up riots in Thrace and Macedonia against the Latins. The refugees, according to Robert of Clari&#x27;s account, also pledged they would elect him emperor if he invaded the Latin Empire. The Greek burghers of Adrianople (now Edirne in Turkey) and nearby towns rose up against the Latins in early 1205. Kaloyan promised that he would send them reinforcements before Easter. Considering Kaloyan&#x27;s cooperation with the rebels a dangerous alliance, Emperor Baldwin decided to launch a counter-attack and ordered the withdrawal of his troops from Asia Minor. He laid siege to Adrianople before he could muster all his troops. Kaloyan hurried to the town at the head of an army of more than 14,000 Bulgarian, Vlach and Cuman warriors. A feigned retreat by the Cumans drew the heavy cavalry of the crusaders into an ambush in the marshes north of Adrianople, enabling Kaloyan to inflict a crushing defeat on them on 14April 1205.

Baldwin was captured on the battlefield and died in captivity in Tarnovo. Choniates accused Kaloyan of having tortured and murdered Baldwin because he &quot;seethed with anger&quot; against the crusaders. George Akropolites added that Baldwin&#x27;s head was &quot;cleaned of all its contents and decorated all round with ornaments&quot; to be used as a goblet by Kaloyan. On the other hand, Baldwin&#x27;s brother and successor, Henry, informed the pope that Kaloyan behaved respectfully towards the crusaders who had been captured at Adrianople.

Kaloyan&#x27;s troops pillaged Thrace and Macedonia after his victory over the Latins. He launched a campaign against the Kingdom of Thessalonica, laying siege to Serres in late May. He promised free passage to the defenders, but after their surrender he broke his word and took them captive. He continued the campaign and seized Veria and Moglena (now Almopia in Greece). Most inhabitants of Veria were murdered or captured on his orders. Henry (who still ruled the Latin Empire as regent) launched a counter-invasion against Bulgaria in June. He could not capture Adrianople and a sudden flood forced him to lift the siege of Didymoteicho.

Kaloyan decided to take vengeance of the townspeople of Philippopolis, who had voluntarily cooperated with the crusaders. With the assistance of the local Paulicians, he seized the town and ordered the murder of the most prominent burghers. The commoners were delivered in chains to Vlachia (a loosely defined territory, located to the south of the lower Danube). He returned to Tarnovo after a riot had broken out against him in the second half of 1205 or early 1206. He &quot;subjected the rebels to harsh punishments and novel methods of execution&quot;, according to Choniates. He again invaded Thrace in January 1206. He captured Rousion (now Keşan in Turkey) and massacred its Latin garrison. He then destroyed most of the fortresses along the Via Egnatia, as far as Athira (present-day Büyükçekmece in Turkey). The local inhabitants were captured and forcibly relocated to the lower Danube. Akropolites recorded that thereafter Kaloyan called himself &quot;Romanslayer&quot;, with a clear reference to Basil II who had been known as the &quot;Bulgarslayer&quot; after his destruction of the First Bulgarian Empire.

The massacre and capture of their compatriots outraged the Greeks in Thrace and Macedonia. They realized that Kaloyan was more hostile to them than the Latins. The burghers of Adrianople and Didymoteicho approached Henry offering their submission. Henry accepted the offer and assisted Theodore Branas in taking possession of the two towns. Kaloyan attacked Didymoteicho in June, but the crusaders forced him to lift the siege. Soon after Henry was crowned emperor on 20August, Kaloyan returned and destroyed Didymoteicho. He then laid siege to Adrianople, but Henry forced him to withdraw his troops from Thrace. Henry also broke into Bulgaria and released 20,000 prisoners in October. Boniface, King of Thessalonica, had meanwhile recaptured Serres.

Kaloyan concluded an alliance with Theodore I Laskaris, Emperor of Nicaea. Laskaris had started a war against David Komnenos, Emperor of Trebizond, who was supported by the Latins. He persuaded Kaloyan to invade Thrace, forcing Henry to withdraw his troops from Asia Minor. Kaloyan laid siege to Adrianople in April 1207, using trebuchets, but the defenders resisted. A month later, the Cumans abandoned Kaloyan&#x27;s camp, because they wanted to return to the Pontic steppes, which compelled Kaloyan to lift the siege. Innocent III urged Kaloyan to make peace with the Latins, but he did not obey.

Henry concluded a truce with Laskaris in July 1207. He also had a meeting with Boniface of Thessalonica, who acknowledged his suzerainty at Kypsela in Thrace. However, on his way back to Thessalonica, Boniface was ambushed and killed at Mosynopolis on 4September. According to Geoffrey of Villehardouin local Bulgarians were the perpetrators and they sent Boniface&#x27;s head to Kaloyan. Robert of Clari and Choniates recorded that Kaloyan had set up the ambush. Boniface was succeeded by his minor son, Demetrius. The child king&#x27;s mother, Margaret of Hungary, took up the administration of the kingdom. Kaloyan hurried to Thessalonica and laid siege to the town.

==Death==
Kaloyan died during the siege of Thessalonica in October 1207, but the circumstances of his death are uncertain. Historian Akropolites (1217/20-1282) stated that he died of pleurisy. He also recorded a rumour claiming that Kaloyan&#x27;s &quot;death was caused by divine wrath; for it seemed to him that an armed man appeared before him in his sleep and struck his side with a spear&quot;.

Legends about Saint Demetrius of Thessalonica&#x27;s intervention on behalf of the besieged town were recorded shortly after Kaloyan&#x27;s death. Robert of Clari wrote before 1216 that the saint himself came to Kaloyan&#x27;s tent and &quot;struck him with a lance through the body&quot;, causing his death. Stefan Nemanjić wrote down the same legend in 1216 in his hagiography of his father, Stefan Nemanja. John Staurakios, who compiled the legends of Saint Demetrius in the late 13th century, recorded that a man riding on a white horse struck Kaloyan with a lance. Kaloyan, continued Staurakios, associated the attacker with Manastras, the commander of his mercenaries, who thus had to flee before Kaloyan&#x27;s death. The legend was depicted on the walls of more than five Orthodox churches and monasteries. For instance, a fresco in the Decani Monastery depicts Saint Demetrius slaying &quot;Tsar Skaloyan&quot;.

The contradictory records of Kaloyan&#x27;s death gave rise to multiple scholarly theories, many of them accepting that he was murdered. Madgearu says Kaloyan was actually murdered by Manastras, who had most probably been hired by Kaloyan&#x27;s wife and nephew, Boril. Historians Genoveva Cankova-Petkova and Francesco Dall&#x27;Aglia also write that Manastras killed Kaloyan, but they assume that the Greeks had persuaded him to turn against the tsar.

==Grave==
The location of Kaloyan&#x27;s grave is unknown. According to the late 13th-century version of the &quot;Life of Saint Sava of Serbia&quot;, Kaloyan&#x27;s body was embalmed and delivered to Tarnovo. However, the older version of the same legend, recorded in 1254, does not mention this episode. A golden ring, which was found in a grave near the Church of the Holy Forty Martyrs in Tarnovo in 1972, bears the Cyrillic inscription &quot;Kaloianov prăsten&quot; (&quot;Kaloyan&#x27;s ring&quot;). Historian Ivan Dujčev stated that the ring proved that Kaloyan&#x27;s remains were transferred to the church, which was built in 1230. The identification of the grave as Kaloyan&#x27;s burial place is controversial, because the ring bearing his name cannot be dated to before the 14th century. Furthermore, the graves of all other royals who were buried in the same place are located within the church, suggesting that the ring was not owned by Kaloyan, but by one of his 14th-century namesakes.

Based on the skull found in the same grave and associated with Kaloyan, anthropologist Jordan Jordanov reconstructed Kaloyan&#x27;s face.

== Family ==

Kaloyan&#x27;s wife was a Cuman princess. She gave birth to Kaloyan&#x27;s only known daughter (whose name is unknown). According to gossip recorded by Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, Kaloyan&#x27;s wife tried to seduce the Latin Emperor Baldwin who had been imprisoned in Tarnovo. However, the gossip continued, Baldwin refused her, for which she accused him of having tried to seduce her. Outraged by his wife&#x27;s claim, Kaloyan had Baldwin executed and fed his corpse to the dogs. Based on the story of Potiphar and his wife, the rumour is obviously unreliable, according to Madgearu. After Kaloyan&#x27;s death, his widow married his successor, Boril. Boril gave Kaloyan&#x27;s daughter in marriage to the Latin Emperor Henry in 1211.

<text>The Caterpillar D9 is a large track-type tractor designed and manufactured by Caterpillar Inc. It is usually sold as a bulldozer equipped with a detachable large blade and a rear ripper attachment.

The D9, with 354 kW (474 hp) of gross power and an operating weight of , is in the upper end of Caterpillar&#x27;s track-type tractors, which range in size from the D2 69 kW (92 hp), , to the D11 698 kW (935 hp), .

The size, durability, reliability, and low operating costs have made the D9 one of the most popular large track-type tractors in the world.

==Engineering and technical description==

The D9 is a series of heavy tracked-type tractors, carried on continuous tracks and usually used as bulldozers. The series began in 1954 with a prototype tractor called the D9X. Ten D9X prototype models were built in 1954. In 1955, the D9 was introduced to compete against the more powerful Euclid TC-12. The D9 came equipped with a 1,473 cid D353, which powered the D9 until the 1980 introduction of the D9L. In 1956, the D9 had its engine power raised to . The new D9E replaced that model in 1959. Two years later, the legendary D9G was introduced; it remained in production for 13 years; it became the main crawler on many job sites, testifying to its sturdiness and design.

In 1965, West Coast businessman Buster Peterson hooked up a pair of D9Gs to pushload the largest wheel tractor scrapers built. In 1968, Caterpillar bought the rights to this concept, thus the DD9G was created (DD stands for Dual D9G). Peterson also built the first SxS D9G, which has two D9Gs side-by-side, pushing a -wide bulldozer blade.

In 1969, Caterpillar introduced this new SxS D9G. In 1974, the improved D9H was introduced to replace the D9G. The D9H is still the most powerful conventional track-type tractor in company history. The DD9H and the SxS D9H soon followed.

In 1980, the D9L was introduced. The unit featured the same new type of elevated drive sprocket undercarriage as had been introduced on the larger D10 in 1977. The new undercarriage design reduced strain and shock loads on the final drives and gave the &quot;belly pan&quot; more ground clearance. The elevated-drive-sprocket undercarriage is a modular design. To repair the machines, one breaks down the tracks and pulls the drive sprockets out. As a result, one can pull the powershift transmission out of the rear.

The D9L was replaced by the D10N in 1987. The D9N replaced D8L in 1987 (this was due to a model number/size adjustment by Caterpillar in their larger bulldozer lineup at the time, allowing them to introduce a smaller D8N model below the larger D8L size). Due to the model adjustment, the D9L is the most powerful D9 in history, with a flywheel power of . The D9L is also the heaviest D9 in history at .

In 1988, Caterpillar produced their 25,000th elevated-drive-sprocket track-type tractor, a D9N. The D9R replaced the D9N in 1996. The D9T replaced the D9R in 2004. The main difference between the D9T and the D9R is the installment of the new Cat C18 ACERT inline-six engine in the D9T vs the V8 3408 HEUI in the D9R. The D9R has clutch and brake steering, while the D9T has differential steering. The D9T has a low-emissions ACERT diesel engine. The current model is the D9 (no letter); however, older models such as the D9T, D9R, D9N, and D9L are still commonly used. The L, N, R, and T models of the D9 are visually very similar, differing primarily in the design of their internal systems.

The D9&#x27;s primary working tools are the blade, affixed to the front and controlled by four hydraulic cylinders, and an optional ripper, which can be attached to the back. The blade is mainly intended for earthmoving and bulk material handling: pushing up sand, soil, and rubble. It also can be used to push other heavy equipment such as earthmoving scraper pans, and in military applications, main battle tanks. The dozer blade usually has three variants:
* A straight blade (&quot;S-blade&quot;) is short and has no lateral curve, with no side wings, and can be used for fine grading.
* A universal blade (&quot;U-blade&quot;) is tall and very curved, and has large side wings to carry more material.
* A &quot;S-U&quot; combination blade is shorter, has less curvature, and has smaller side wings. This blade is typically used for pushing piles of large rocks, such as at a quarry.
Like many other bulldozers, the D9 can be fitted with other devices, such as mine plows.

The rear ripper is intended for use in loosening rocky ground and ripping out larger stones. It can also break frozen ground and excavate small ditches. The ripper can be replaced with a multi-shank ripper, allowing the bulldozer to comb the ground.

The size, power, and weight of the larger track-type tractors dictate that they are used primarily for major projects. The D9 is most commonly found in use in construction, demolition, forestry, mining, waste, and quarry operations.

==Military applications==


Caterpillar Inc. does not manufacture a military version of the D9 &quot;per se&quot;, but the attributes that make the D9 popular for major construction projects make it desirable for military applications, as well, and with Israeli modifications and armor, it has been particularly effective for the Israel Defense Forces and also used by KBR in Iraq.

The US Army used D9 bulldozers to clear forest in the Vietnam War, but after the war, they were replaced with smaller and cheaper Caterpillar D7G bulldozers. D7G bulldozers are still very common in US combat engineering battalions, but a series of oft-recurrent suggestions have been made to replace the lighter D7Gs with the newer and more heavily armored D9s. currently the US Army fields around 1300 D7r’s that are a combination of armored and non armored. 
The Caterpillar D9 have been used by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since it was introduced, but an armored model, with Israeli-developed vehicle armor kit, was introduced only in 1986, on the D9L. The IDF Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozer is operated by combat soldiers from the Combat Engineering Corps after going through a 2-month course. Many of the D9 operators are reservists and veterans, who operated heavy equipment also as civilians. The current models of the D9 employed by the IDF are the D9L, D9N, D9R, and D9T. Most of the IDF&#x27;s D9 fleet today are composed of the D9R with slat armor.

IDF D9 bulldozers were used during the Second Intifada (2000–2005) to demolish Palestinian structures and clear improvised explosive devices. The Israeli armor provides protection from small arms and explosives, and the bulldozers were used the Battle of Jenin 2002 during Operation Defensive Shield. A 2003 incident involving an IDF D9, in which a 23-year-old American activist was killed, resulted in a lawsuit brought against Caterpillar, Inc. in the United States. The court dismissed the case on grounds that it was outside their jurisdiction, and that Israeli tort law was a sufficient avenue to pursue remedies. Today, the D9 is one of the main combat engineering tools of the IDF.

<text>Robert Malet (c. 1050 – by 1130) was a Norman-English baron and a close advisor of Henry I.

==Early life==
Malet was the son of William Malet, and inherited his father&#x27;s great honour of Eye in 1071. This made him one of the dozen or so greatest landholders in England. According to the Domesday book he held 221 manors in Suffolk, 32 in Yorkshire, eight in Lincolnshire, three in Essex, two in Nottinghamshire, and one in Hampshire. He also inherited the family property in Normandy.

==Public life==
From 1070 to 1080, Malet was High Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, and helped suppress the rebellion of Ralph Wader. Afterwards, he appeared frequently at King William I&#x27;s court. All changed with the accession of William II. By 1094 Malet&#x27;s English lands had been taken away from him. The reasons are unknown, and no more is known of Malet&#x27;s activities during William II&#x27;s reign. Most likely he was in Normandy, and it may be that his falling out with William II was due to his preference for Duke Robert of Normandy in the rivalry between the two brothers.

Malet reappeared in the public record three days after the death of William II in 1100, as a witness to Henry I&#x27;s coronation charter. He must have been with Henry at the time of William&#x27;s death, or rushed from Normandy when word came. In any case, Malet soon regained his office as Sheriff of Suffolk, and his honour of Eye.

It was thought that Malet had some quarrel with the king, and again lost his lands, on the basis of some statements by Orderic Vitalis, but most historians now think Orderic confused Malet with his successor, William Malet. However it appears that Robert Malet remained in the king&#x27;s confidence and held his lands until his death.

Some sources claim that a Robert Malet died at the battle of Tinchebrai (28 September 1106), though there is no specific evidence linking this to Robert Malet of Suffolk.

Until some time before 1130, Malet was appointed Lord Great Chamberlain (or Master Chamberlain), the first person to hold this position. Little is known about the role attached at the time to this title or what it entailed. It is possible, however, that the position succeeded that of a &quot;Lord High Steward&quot;. While the rest of the financial responsibilities of the parent job were separated from that job and were given under the newly-formed title of Lord High Treasurer in 1126. So perhaps Malet became &quot;Lord Great Chamberlain&quot; in 1126 when the job of Lord High Treasurer seems to have been formed.

<doc id="289916" wikidata="Q1912008" url="?curid=289916" title="Mawashi">
<text>In sumo, a is the loincloth that (sumo wrestlers) wear during training or in competition. Upper ranked professional wrestlers wear a as part of the ring entry ceremony or .

==&quot;Mawashi&quot;==

===&quot;Sekitori&quot;===
====During competition====
For top ranked professional (known as ), the &quot;mawashi&quot; is made of silk and comes in a variety of colours. It is approximately in length when unwrapped, about wide and weighs about . It is wrapped several times around the and fastened in the back by a large knot. A series of stiffened silk fronds of matching colour called are inserted into the front of the . Their number varies from 13 to 25, and is always an odd number. They mark out the only part of the that it is illegal to grab on to: the vertical part covering the &#x27;s groin, and if they fall out during competition the (referee) will throw them from the ring at the first opportunity.

Many are superstitious and will change the color of their to change their luck. Sometimes a poor performance will cause them to change colors for the next tournament, or even during a tournament, in an attempt to change their luck for the better. An example of this was done by Ōnoshō during the 2020 July tournament, when, after several losses in a row, he decided to change from crimson to dark gray.

====During training====
 only wear the silk during competitive bouts either during ranking tournaments or touring displays. During training, a heavy white cotton is worn. For senior in the top two divisions, this belt is coloured white, and it is worn with one end distinctively looped at the front. are not worn during training.

===Lower-division &quot;rikishi&quot;===
 ranked in the lower professional divisions wear a black cotton both for training and in competition. In competition, cotton are inserted into the belt, but these are not stiffened.

===Amateur sumo===

Amateur sumo wrestlers wear a cotton of any color without the looping accorded to the senior professional&#x27;s training garb. Additionally, they may wear a tag on the front of their that identifies them individually or the nation they are competing for, depending on the competition. Amateur sumo wrestlers are also allowed (or required, in the case of women wrestlers) to wear shorts or leotards under their while professional are not.

===Techniques and rules===
Sometimes a may wear his in such a way as to give him some advantage over his opponent. He may wear it loosely to make it more difficult to be thrown, or he may wrap it tightly and splash a little water on it to help prevent his opponent from getting a good grip on it. His choice will depend on the type of techniques he prefers to employ in his bouts. Thus a wrestler preferring belt sumo will usually wear it more loosely, while those preferring pushing techniques will tend to wear the more tightly.

If a wrestler&#x27;s comes off during a tournament bout, he is automatically disqualified. This is extremely rare, but did occur in May 2000, when wrestler Asanokiri&#x27;s came off during a match with Chiyohakuhō. However, for most of sumo&#x27;s history, whether or not a wrestler&#x27;s came off during a bout was considered irrelevant, and the policy of disqualification only came into place when Japan began adopting European attitudes towards nudity.

Wrestlers in the two upper divisions, and , are allowed to wear a second ceremonial during their ring entering ceremony. The silk &#x27;belt&#x27; opens out at one end into a large apron which is usually heavily embroidered and with thick tassels at the bottom. The fringe and tassels of the are usually gold but may be any color except purple, which is reserved for use by and only.

The may advertise the produce of a sponsor of the (for example Bulgarian Kotoōshū was sponsored by a Japanese brand of yogurt, &quot;Bulgaria&quot;, which was prominently displayed on the front of his ) or be a gift from one of the &#x27;s support groups. Alternatively, some foreign-born (such as Czech-born Takanoyama) bear their national flag on their . Popular may be given many of these .

 have matching sets of three , with two being worn by his wrestler &quot;assistants&quot; (his and ) during his ring entrance ceremony.

In the Edo period, the also served as the wrestler&#x27;s fighting . However, as the aprons become more ornate, eventually the two functions were split apart. In this period wrestlers were normally sponsored by feudal or overlords, whose clan crest would therefore appear on the .
