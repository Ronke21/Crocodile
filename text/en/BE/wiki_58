<text>Sante Kimes (née Singhrs; July 24, 1934 – May 19, 2014) also known as the Dragon Lady, was an American murderer, con artist, robber, fraudster, serial arsonist and possible serial killer who was convicted on multiple charges, including: two murders, robbery, forgery and slavery. Her decades-long crime spreeincluding throughout her marriage to her second husband, millionaire Kenneth Kimes Sr., then continuing with theft and fraud against his estate by hiding his death for yearsdid not end until she was arrested for the murder of Irene Silverman in New York City. Many of these crimes were committed with the assistance of her son, Kenneth Kimes Jr. Both were tried and convicted together on 118 charges, including the murder of Silverman.

Kenneth made a plea deal in the murder of David Kazdin in Los Angeles, pleading guilty and agreeing to testify against his mother in her trial for the murder in return for neither of them facing a death sentence. Sante was subsequently convicted of the Kazdin murder. The pair were also suspected but never charged in a third murder in the Bahamas, to which Kenneth later confessed. Sante admitted to her son that she murdered the partner in one of her arsons, Elmer Ambrose Holmgren, who had disappeared during a trip to Costa Rica with her; no charges were brought in this crime. 

==Early life and criminal history==
Sante Kimes was born Sandra Louise Singhrs in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on July 24, 1934, the third of four children born to Mary Van Horn, a native of Illinois, and Prama Mahendra Singhrs, an East Indian immigrant. When Sante was three years old, her father abandoned the family and her mother resorted to prostitution to support the family, resulting in Sante being molested by several adults. According to her estranged sister, Sante had an incestuous relationship with her older brother and was a pyromaniac who held lit matches underneath her sister&#x27;s fingers against her will. As a child, Sante would tie up the goats and dogs on her family&#x27;s farm and use hatpins to mutilate and torture them.

When she was a teenager, Sante moved with her mother and sister to Los Angeles, California, and was promptly adopted by Edwin and Mary Chambers, along with another boy. She moved with her new family to Carson City, Nevada, where she graduated from Carson High School in 1952. At school, Sante earned a reputation as a bully who frequently belittled and intimidated younger students. In 1956 she reunited with a former boyfriend from high school, Edward Walker. They married the following year and had one son, Kent Walker. After a 1961 shoplifting conviction in Sacramento, Sante separated and reconciled intermittently with Walker, but their divorce was not finalized until 1969.

Walker was a general contractor who built homes in the Sacramento area; in December 1960, Sante set fire to a house he had built to fraudulently collect insurance. She only destroyed the kitchen and received (). During the course of their marriage, dozens of homes that Walker had supervised burned down, and Sante had a number of affairs with his wealthy business associates. After her first divorce, Sante and her son travelled to Palm Springs. In 1971 she met motel tycoon Kenneth Keith Kimes Sr., seventeen years her senior, after reading about his divorce in a magazine article and learning that he had a net worth of approximately $20million (equivalent to $million in ). The couple married in Clark County, Nevada, on April 5, 1981. They had one son, Kenneth Kimes Jr. (born March 24, 1975).

Sante spent the better part of her life fleecing people of money, expensive merchandise and real estate, either through arson, elaborate con games, forgery or outright theft. She committed insurance fraud on numerous occasions, frequently by committing arson and then collecting money for property damage. She also frequently introduced her husband Kenneth Sr. as an ambassador, a ploy that even gained the couple access to a White House reception during the Ford Administration, and sometimes even impersonating Elizabeth Taylor, whom she resembled slightly.

Sante committed many acts of fraud that were not even financially necessary, such as enslaving maids when she could easily afford to pay them. She frequently offered young, homeless undocumented immigrants housing and employment, then kept them as virtual prisoners by threatening to report them to the authorities if they did not follow her orders. As a result, she and Kenneth Sr. spent years squandering his fortune on lawyers&#x27; fees, defending themselves against charges of slavery. 

Sante was eventually arrested in August 1985 and was sentenced by the United States District Court to five years&#x27; imprisonment for violating federal anti-slavery laws and was successfully sued by Honolulu civil attorney David Schutter in civil court. Kenneth Sr. took a plea bargain and agreed to complete an alcohol treatment program. He and Kenneth Jr. lived a reasonably normal life until Sante was released from prison in 1989. Kenneth Sr. died of a brain aneurysm in 1994.

==Murders==
===Elmer Holmgren===
On September 18, 1990, Sante hired 50-year-old lawyer Elmer Ambrose Holmgren to burn her Honolulu home due to a lien on the property, and the fact it would have cost (equivalent to $ million in ) to sell it. Insurance investigators interviewed Holmgren, who admitted his involvement in the arson. On October 24, Sante burned Holmgren&#x27;s office because he possessed a number of legal documents related to the case which would have incriminated her.

Before a case could be brought to trial, Holmgren told his family that he was taking a trip to Costa Rica with Sante and Kenneth Sr. on August 2, 1991. He has not been seen since. In November 2000, Kenneth Jr. admitted that his mother had told him that she killed Holmgren by hitting him in the head with a hammer in a car, while she was riding in the backseat and he was riding in the front passenger&#x27;s seat. Holmgren&#x27;s body was never found, and no charges were brought against any member of the Kimes family.

===Syed Bilal Ahmed===
Kenneth Jr. confessed to murdering 46-year-old banker Syed Bilal Ahmed, who was in charge of Sante&#x27;s offshore bank accounts, at his mother&#x27;s behest in Nassau, Bahamas, on September 4, 1996, which had been suspected by Bahamian authorities at the time. He testified that the two acted together to drug Ahmed, drown him in a bathtub and dump his body offshore, but no charges were ever filed in that case. Sante denied any involvement in or knowledge of the murders, and she claimed that Kenneth Jr. confessed solely to avoid receiving the death penalty.

===David Kazdin===
David Kazdin, aged 63, had allowed Sante to use his name on the deed of a home in Las Vegas that was actually occupied by her and Kenneth Sr. in the 1970s. Several years later, Sante convinced a notary to forge Kazdin&#x27;s signature on a loan application for $280,000 (), with the house as collateral. When Kazdin discovered the forgery through a letter sent from his bank and threatened to expose Sante, she ordered Kenneth Jr. to kill him. On March 9, 1998, Kenneth Jr. murdered Kazdin in his Los Angeles home by shooting him in the back of the head. According to another accomplice&#x27;s later testimony, all three participated in disposing of the evidence. Kazdin&#x27;s body was found in a dumpster near Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in March 1998. The murder weapon was never recovered, having been disassembled and dropped into a storm sewer.

===Irene Silverman===
82-year-old socialite and former ballerina Irene Zambelli Silverman was last seen at her townhouse on East 65th Street in New York City on July 5, 1998. Kenneth Jr. was a tenant in Silverman&#x27;s mansion at the time she went missing, having moved into one of her apartments the previous month using an alias.

Authorities arrested Sante and Kenneth Jr. on the day of Silverman&#x27;s disappearance with the initial charges stemming from a fraudulent check written in Utah for $14,900 () earlier in 1998; they were charged with Silverman&#x27;s murder in December 1998 and convicted in 2000. Authorities believe mother and son devised a scheme whereby Sante would assume the identity of Silverman and appropriate ownership of her mansion, which was valued at $7.7million (equivalent to $ million in ). The pair recorded Silverman&#x27;s phone conversations and kept a set of fifteen notebooks on which Sante had written detailed descriptions of mortgage fraud schemes involving many intended victims, including both Silverman and Kazdin.

When he was arrested, Kenneth Jr. had in his possession Silverman&#x27;s keys, cassettes of her tape-recorded calls, loaded firearms, wigs, masks, plastic handcuffs, $30,000 in cash (), an empty stun gun box and a substance similar to a &quot;date rape&quot; drug. He also held a forged deed which approved the transfer of Silverman&#x27;s multi-million dollar townhouse to Sante&#x27;s shell corporation for $395,000 (). During the trial for Kazdin&#x27;s murder, Kenneth Jr. confessed that after his mother had used a stun gun on Silverman, he strangled her, stuffed her corpse into a bag and deposited it in a dumpster in Hoboken, New Jersey.

== Investigation and arrest ==
The investigation into the Kimes family officially began on March 14, 1998, when Kazdin&#x27;s remains were found in a dumpster near LAX. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) detectives assigned to the investigation focused on the mortgage application with the forged signature that falsely linked Kazdin to a house in Las Vegas which had been partly burned down in an attempted arson. The supposed homeowner turned out to be David McCarran, a homeless man who said Sante and Kenneth Jr. had lit the arson fire. He also claimed to have been forced to stay in the house by the Kimes family, who hoped to collect the insurance money from the loss of the house.

Investigators also located Stan Patterson, a second man who confessed to selling a handgun to Kenneth Jr. which he used to kill Kazdin. He was told of several potential felony charges stemming from the murder and mortgage fraud, and reluctantly agreed to cooperate with police in apprehending the pair to avoid prosecution. At the end of June 1998, Patterson got a call from Sante about an expensive townhouse in New York&#x27;s Upper West Side she wanted to sell, and she needed his help with the paperwork. Patterson agreed to meet her in New York on July 5. He informed the FBI about the scheduled meeting before he left on July 3. Two days later, Patterson met Sante at the New York Hilton around 6 PM that evening. Around 7 PM, Kenneth Jr. arrived at the Hilton and approached Sante. Upon his appearance FBI and New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers arrested both of them.

== Trials, imprisonment and death ==
The Kimeses first trial was in New York, for the Silverman murder and its extended list of associated crimes. Evidence recovered from their car helped establish the case for trying them for Kazdin&#x27;s murder as well. The Silverman trial was unusual in many aspects, namely the fact that no body was ever recovered. Nonetheless, the jury voted unanimouslyon their first pollto convict Sante and Kenneth Jr. not only of murder but of 117 other charges including robbery, burglary, conspiracy, grand larceny, illegal weapons possession, forgery and eavesdropping.

The judge also took the unusual step of ordering Sante not to speak to the media even after the jury had been sequestered, as a result of her passing a note to &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter David Rhode in court. He threatened to have Sante handcuffed during further court appearances if she persisted and restricted her telephone access to calls to her lawyers. The judge contended that Sante was attempting to influence the jury as they may have seen or heard any such interviews, and that there would be no cross-examination as there would be in court. Sante had earlier chosen to not take the stand in her own defense after the judge ruled that prosecutors could question her about her previous convictions, including her prison time on her slavery conviction.

During the sentencing portion of the Silverman trial, Sante made a prolonged statement to the court blaming the authorities, including the Kimeses lawyers, for framing her and her son. She went on to compare their trial to the Salem Witch Trials and claimed that the prosecutors were guilty of &quot;murdering the Constitution&quot; before the judge told her to be quiet. When the statement was concluded, the judge responded that Sante was a sociopath and a degenerate, and that her son was a dupe and a &quot;remorseless predator&quot;, before imposing the maximum sentence on both of them. This amounted to 120 years for Sante and 124 years for her son, effectively sentencing both of them to life imprisonment.

In October 2000, while doing an prison interview, Kenneth Jr. held Court TV reporter Maria Zone hostage by pressing a ballpoint pen into her throat. Zone had interviewed Kenneth Jr. in prison once before without incident. His demand was that his mother not be extradited to California, where the two faced the death penalty for the murder of Kazdin. After four hours of negotiation, Zone broke free when Kenneth Jr. removed the pen from her throat for a moment. Negotiators had created a distraction which allowed them to quickly remove Zone and wrestle Kenneth Jr. to the ground.

In March 2001, Kenneth Jr. was extradited to Los Angeles to stand trial for the murder of Kazdin. Sante was extradited to Los Angeles in June 2001. During that trial in June 2004, Kenneth Jr. changed his plea to &quot;guilty&quot; and implicated his mother in Kazdin&#x27;s murder in exchange for a plea deal that he not receive the death penalty and neither would his mother if was convicted. He then testified in trial against his mother, exposing every detail about their multiple crimes and describing how she indoctrinated him into becoming her accomplice. 

Sante again made a prolonged statement denying the murders and accusing police and prosecutors of various kinds of misconduct, and she was again eventually ordered by the presiding judge to be silent. The judge in the Kazdin case called Sante &quot;one of the most evil individuals&quot; she had encountered in her time on the bench. Sante was returned to New York state to continue serving her first murder conviction, and died at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women on May 19, 2014. Kenneth Jr. is currently incarcerated at Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in California.

==In media==
The 2001 made-for-TV movie, &quot;Like Mother, Like Son: The Strange Story of Sante and Kenny Kimes&quot;, starred Mary Tyler Moore as Sante, Gabriel Olds as Kenneth Jr. and Jean Stapleton as Silverman. In 2006, another TV movie based on a book about the case, &quot;A Little Thing Called Murder&quot;, starring Judy Davis and Jonathan Jackson, aired on Lifetime. Sante was also featured in a 2009 episode of the television show &quot;Dateline&quot; and a 2015 episode of &quot;Diabolical Women&quot;. The Kimes&#x27; story was recounted on Oxygen&#x27;s &quot;Snapped&quot;, in an episode that aired on August 30, 2020.

<text>Velvet ants (Mutillidae) are a family of more than 7,000 species of wasps whose wingless females resemble large, hairy ants. Their common name velvet ant refers to their resemblance to an ant, and their dense pile of hair, which most often is bright scarlet or orange, but may also be black, white, silver, or gold. Their bright colors serve as aposematic signals. They are known for their extremely painful stings, (the sting of the species &quot;Dasymutilla klugii&quot; rated a 3 on the Schmidt pain index and lasts up to 30 minutes), and has resulted in the common name &quot;cow killer&quot; or &quot;cow ant&quot; being applied to the species &quot;Dasymutilla occidentalis.&quot; However, mutillids are not aggressive and sting only in defense. In addition, the actual toxicity of their venom is much lower than that of honey bees or harvester ants. Unlike true ants, they are solitary, and lack complex social systems.

== Distribution ==
Mutillidae can be found worldwide with about 230 genera or subgenera and around 8,000 species worldwide. Over 400 species occur in the North American Southwest.

North American Mutillidae have eight phenotypically distinct and geographically limited Müllerian mimicry rings (Desert, Eastern, Madrean, Texan, Red-headed &quot;Timulla&quot;, Black-headed &quot;Timulla&quot;, Tropical, and Western) making up one of the largest Müllerian mimicry complexes on the planet. These mimicry rings are the result of repeated convergent evolution of aposematic traits between co-occurring velvet ant species, rather than shared phylogenetic history. Through the evolution of aposematic traits in velvet ant species in the same ring, local predators have learned to avoid these well-defended wasps.

==Description==
The exoskeleton of all velvet ants is unusually tough (to the point that some entomologists have reported difficulty piercing them with steel pins when attempting to mount them for display in cabinets). This characteristic allows them to successfully invade the nests of their prey and also helps them retain moisture. Mutillids exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism. As in some related families in the Vespoidea, males have wings, but females are wingless. The males and females are so distinct in their morphology that entomologists often find it very hard to determine whether a given male and female belong to the same species, unless they are captured while mating. In some species, the male carries the smaller female aloft while mating, which is also seen in the related family Thynnidae.

As is the case for all aculeates, only female mutillids are capable of inflicting a sting. The stinger is a modified female organ called an ovipositor, which is unusually long and maneuverable in mutillids. In both sexes, a structure called a stridulitrum on the metasoma is used to produce a squeaking or chirping sound when alarmed. Both sexes of mutillids also bear hair-lined grooves on the side of the metasoma called felt lines. Only two other vespoid families (Bradynobaenidae and Chyphotidae) have felt lines, but the females of these families have a distinct pronotum, with a transverse suture separating it from the mesonotum; in female mutillids, these two thoracic segments are completely fused. Members of the family Myrmosidae, formerly classified as a subfamily of mutillids, also have a distinct pronotum in females, but lack felt lines in both sexes.

==Behavior==
Adult mutillids feed on nectar. Although some species are strictly nocturnal, females are often active during the day. Females of &quot;Tricholabiodes thisbe&quot; are sometimes active up to two hours before sunset. Guido Nonveiller (1963) hypothesized the Mutillidae are generally stenothermic and thermophilic; they may not avoid light, but rather are active during temperatures that usually occur only after sunset.

==Defense mechanisms==
Predation is one of the strongest forces natural selection uses to drive the evolution of an organism&#x27;s morphology, physiology, and behavior. During this coevolution, the prey either being consumed by the predator or escaping has resulted in a plethora of impressive defensive strategies in prey species to improve the likelihood of escape. Velvet ants avoid predation using the following defense mechanisms: a venomous sting (if female), aposematic coloration, a stridulatory organ in their abdomen, an alarm secretion from their mandibular gland, and a durable exoskeleton. This array of defenses has contributed to the velvet ants being attributed the title of &quot;the indestructible insect.&quot; This title was bestowed on them after experimental interactions between velvet ants and their potential predators that resulted in the survival of the ant and the ultimate avoidance by the predator.

The venom that velvet ants inject through their stinger has been investigated for five species of &quot;Dasymutilla&quot;, revealing that they are composed primarily of peptides. According to one researcher, the painfulness of the sting of &quot;Dasymutilla klugii&quot; outscored 58 other species of stinging insects tested; the only species this researcher rated as having a more painful sting were &quot;Paraponera clavata&quot; (bullet ant), &quot;Synoeca septentrionalis&quot; (warrior wasp), and &quot;Pepsis&quot; and &quot;Hemipepsis&quot; spp. (tarantula hawks). In an experimental setting, only two lizard species (one whiptail and one side-blotched lizard) attacked a velvet ant it was exposed to. In both cases the velvet ants were exhibiting rapid lateral and vertical movements to ward off an attack. Once the attack occurred the velvet ants would immediately sting the lizards. This sting resulted in the dropping of the ants in both cases and avoidance for the remainder of the trial. The side-blotched lizard was found dead in its tank 24 hours later. The side-blotched lizard is a natural predator of velvet ants, while the whiptail is not.
The aposematic coloration of velvet ants often corresponds to a specific Müllerian mimicry ring consisting of dozens of species. This offers protection because many local predators have learned to avoid prey with this same coloration. To test the aposematic coloration on birds, mealworms were painted to resemble a velvet ant. During these trials, none of the painted mealworms were consumed, while all the control mealworms were consumed immediately. However, the painted mealworms were attacked by the birds, but the birds immediately ceased the attack. These experiments provide evidence that the aposematic coloration of velvet ants causes their predators to hesitate, acting as a visual defense mechanism.

The stridulatory organ that velvet ants possess produces an audible squeaking when the abdomen is contracted. This mechanism is an auditory cue warning predators that are about to attack to stay away. In one experiment, every time a shrew got within 1 meter of a velvet ant, the velvet ant would begin stridulating. Stridulations became more frequent as the predator moved closer to the velvet ant, and the shrew never attempted to attack the velvet ant. However, different scenarios with shrews have shown that the velvet ant would also stridulate after the shrew attacked it. Every time this occurred the shrew dropped the wasp.

The exoskeleton of the velvet ant is remarkably strong. It required 11 times more force to crush than that of the honeybee. As well as being durable, the exoskeleton is also round, making it more difficult for predators to pierce it with attempted stings or bites. During all the trials that led to the fracture of a velvet ant&#x27;s exoskeleton, a total of 4 times resulted in the death of that velvet ant within 24 hours. Aside from protection from predators, the exoskeleton also helps control moisture.

Due to these strong defense mechanisms, local predators generally avoid the velvet ants, so it has been difficult to determine their predators. One study found tropical and subtropical iguanian lizards (Dactyloidae) to be a local predator of velvet ants in the black-headed &quot;Timulla&quot; and tropical mimicry rings.

== Life cycle ==

Male mutillids fly in search of females; after mating, the female enters a host insect nest, typically a ground-nesting bee or wasp burrow, and deposits one egg near each larva or pupa. Only a few species are known to parasitize other types of hosts; exceptions include the European velvet ant, &quot;Mutilla europaea&quot;, one of the only species that attacks social bees (e.g., &quot;Bombus&quot;), and the genus &quot;Pappognatha&quot;, whose hosts are tree-dwelling orchid bees. The mutillid larvae then develop as idiobiont ectoparasitoids, eventually killing their immobile larval/pupal hosts within a week or two. Velvet ants exhibit haplodiploid sex determination, as do other members of the superfamily Vespoidea.
==Taxonomy==
Recent classifications of Vespoidea &quot;sensu lato&quot; (beginning in 2008) concluded that the family Mutillidae contained one subfamily that was unrelated to the remainder, and this subfamily was removed to form a separate family Myrmosidae.

<doc id="285709" wikidata="Q837389" url="?curid=285709" title="Latin jazz">
<text>Latin jazz is a genre of jazz with Latin American rhythms. The two main categories are Afro-Cuban jazz, rhythmically based on Cuban popular dance music, with a rhythm section employing ostinato patterns or a clave, and Afro-Brazilian jazz, which includes samba and bossa nova.

==Afro-Cuban jazz==
===&quot;Spanish tinge&quot;—The Cuban influence in early jazz and proto-Latin jazz===
African American music began incorporating Afro-Cuban musical motifs in the 19th century, when the habanera (Cuban contradanza) gained international popularity. The habanera was the first written music to be rhythmically based on an African motif. The &quot;habanera rhythm&quot; (also known as &quot;congo&quot;, &quot;tango-congo&quot;, or &quot;tango&quot; ) can be thought of as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat. Wynton Marsalis considers tresillo to be the New Orleans &quot;clave,&quot; although technically, the pattern is only half a clave.
&quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; (1914) by W. C. Handy has a habanera-tresillo bass line. Handy noted a reaction to the habanera rhythm included in Will H. Tyler&#x27;s &quot;Maori&quot;: &quot;I observed that there was a sudden, proud and graceful reaction to the rhythm...White dancers, as I had observed them, took the number in stride. I began to suspect that there was something Negroid in that beat.&quot; After noting a similar reaction to the same rhythm in &quot;La Paloma&quot;, Handy included this rhythm in his &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot;, the instrumental copy of &quot;Memphis Blues&quot;, the chorus of &quot;Beale Street Blues&quot;, and other compositions. Jelly Roll Morton considered the tresillo-habanera (which he called the Spanish tinge) to be an essential ingredient of jazz. The habanera rhythm can be heard in his left hand on songs like &quot;The Crave&quot; (1910, recorded 1938).

Now in one of my earliest tunes, &quot;New Orleans Blues,&quot; you can notice the Spanish tinge. In fact, if you can&#x27;t manage to put tinges of Spanish in your tunes, you will never be able to get the right seasoning, I call it, for jazz—Morton (1938: Library of Congress Recording).
Although the exact origins of jazz syncopation may never be known, there is evidence that the habanera-tresillo was there at its conception. Buddy Bolden, the first &quot;known&quot; jazz musician, is credited with creating the &quot;big four&quot;, a habanera-based pattern. The big four (below) was the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on-the-beat march. As the example below shows, the second half of the big four pattern is the habanera rhythm.
It is probably safe to say that by and large the simpler African rhythmic patterns survived in jazz ... because they could be adapted more readily to European rhythmic conceptions. Some survived, others were discarded as the Europeanization progressed. It may also account for the fact that patterns such as [tresillo have] . . . remained one of the most useful and common syncopated patterns in jazz—Schuller (1968).

The Cuban influence is evident in many pre-1940s jazz tunes, but rhythmically, they are all based on single-celled motifs such as tresillo, and not do not contain an overt two-celled, clave-based structure. &quot;Caravan&quot;, written by Juan Tizol and first performed in 1936, is an early proto-Latin jazz composition. It is not clave-based.

===Jazz in-clave===
The first jazz piece to be overtly based &quot;in-clave&quot;, and therefore, the first true Latin jazz piece, was &quot;Tanga&quot; (1943) composed by Mario Bauza and recorded by Machito and his Afro-Cubans the same year, 1943. The tune was initially a descarga (Cuban jam) with jazz solos superimposed, spontaneously composed by Bauzá.

The right hand of the &quot;Tanga&quot; piano guajeo is in the style known as ponchando, a type of non-arpeggiated guajeo using block chords. The sequence of attack-points is emphasized, rather than a sequence of different pitches. As a form of accompaniment it can be played in a strictly repetitive fashion or as a varied motif akin to jazz comping. The following example is in the style of a 1949 recording by Machito. 2‐3 clave, piano by René Hernández.
The first descarga that made the world take notice is traced to a Machito rehearsal on May 29, 1943, at the Park Palace Ballroom, at 110th Street and 5th Avenue. At this time, Machito was at Fort Dix (New Jersey) in his fourth week of basic training. The day before at La Conga Club, Mario Bauza, Machito&#x27;s trumpeter and music director, heard pianist Luis Varona and bassist Julio Andino play El Botellero composition and arrangements of the Cuban-born Gilberto Valdez which would serve as a permanent sign off (end the dance) tune.

On this Monday evening, Dr. Bauza leaned over the piano and instructed Varona to play the same piano vamp he did the night before. Varona&#x27;s left hand began the introduction of Gilberto Valdes&#x27; El Botellero. Bauza then instructed Julio Andino what to play; then the saxes; then the trumpets. The broken chord sounds soon began to take shape into an Afro-Cuban jazzed up melody. Gene Johnson&#x27;s alto sax then emitted oriental-like jazz phrases. Afro-Cuban jazz was invented when Bauza composed &quot;Tanga&quot; (African word for marijuana) that evening of 1943.

Thereafter, whenever &quot;Tanga&quot; was played, it sounded different, depending on a soloist&#x27;s individuality. In August 1948, when trumpeter Howard McGhee soloed with Machito&#x27;s orchestra at the Apollo Theatre, his ad-libs to &quot;Tanga&quot; resulted in &quot;Cu-Bop City,&quot; a tune which was recorded by Roost Records months later. The jams which took place at the Royal Roots, Bop City and Birdland between 1948 and 1949, when Howard McGhee, tenor saxophonist Brew Moore, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie sat in with the Machito orchestra, were unrehearsed, uninhibited, unheard-of-before jam sessions which at the time, master of ceremonies Symphony Sid called Afro-Cuban jazz.

The Machito orchestra&#x27;s ten- or fifteen-minute jams were the first in Latin music to break away from the traditional under-four-minute recordings. In February 1949, the Machito orchestra became the first to set a precedent in Latin music when it featured tenor saxophonist Flip Phillips in a five-minute recording of &quot;Tanga.&quot; The twelve-inch 78 RPM, part of &quot;The Jazz Scene&quot; album, sold for $25—Salazar (1997).

Mario Bauzá developed the 3-2 / 2-3 clave concept and terminology. A chord progression can begin on either side of clave. When the progression begins on the three-side, the song or song section is said to be in 3–2 clave. When the chord progression begins on the two-side, it is in 2–3 clave. In North America, salsa and Latin jazz charts commonly represent clave in two measures of cut-time (2/2); this is most likely the influence of jazz conventions. When clave is written in two measures (above) changing from one clave sequence to the other is a matter of reversing the order of the measures.

Bobby Sanabria, who was Bauzá&#x27;s drummer, cites several important innovations of Machito&#x27;s band:
* The first band to explore jazz arranging techniques with authentic Afro-Cuban rhythms on a consistent basis giving it a unique identifiable sound that no other band in the genre of Afro-Cuban based dance music had at the time. Cuban big band arranger Chico O&#x27;Farill stated: &quot;This was a new concept in interpreting Cuban music with as much (harmonic) richness as possible. You have to understand how important this was. It made every other band that came after, followers.&quot;
* The first band to explore modal harmony (a concept explored much later by Miles Davis and Gil Evans) from a jazz arranging perspective through their recording of &quot;Tanga.&quot; Of note is the sheet of sound effect in the arrangement through the use of multiple layering.
* The first big band to explore, from an Afro-Cuban rhythmic perspective, large-scale extended compositional works. e.g. &quot;The Afro-Cuban Jazz Suite&quot; by Chico O&#x27;Farill.
* The first band to successfully wed jazz big band arranging techniques within an original composition with jazz oriented soloists utilizing an authentic Afro-Cuban based rhythm section in a successful manner. e.g. Gene Johnson - alto, Brew Moore - tenor, composition - &quot;Tanga&quot; (1943).
* The first Afro-Cuban based dance band to &quot;overtly&quot; explore the concept of clave counterpoint from an arranging standpoint. The ability to weave seamlessly from one side of the clave to the other without breaking its rhythmic integrity within the structure of a musical arrangement.

Bauzá introduced bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie to the Cuban conga drummer Chano Pozo. &quot;Manteca&quot; is the first jazz standard to be rhythmically based on clave. &quot;Manteca&quot; was co-written by Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo in 1947. According to Gillespie, Pozo created the layered, contrapuntal guajeos (Afro-Cuban ostinatos) of the A section and the introduction, and Gillespie wrote the bridge. The rhythm of the melody of the A section is identical to a common mambo bell pattern.

On March 31, 1946, Stan Kenton recorded &quot;Machito,&quot; written by his collaborator / arranger Pete Rugolo, which is considered by some to be the first Latin jazz recording by American jazz musicians. The Kenton band was augmented by Ivan Lopez on bongos and Eugenio Reyes on maracas. Later, on December 6 the same year, Stan Kenton recorded an arrangement of the Afro-Cuban tune &quot;The Peanut Vendor&quot; with members of Machito&#x27;s rhythm section. Kenny Dorham &quot;Minor&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, &quot;Basheer&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Hank Mobley &quot;Recado Bossa Nova&quot; and Sabu Martinez jazz tune developed Afro-Cuban jazz from 50s to 60s.
Cuban percussionist Mongo Santamaria first recorded his composition &quot;Afro Blue&quot; in 1959.
&quot;Afro Blue&quot; was the first jazz standard built upon a typical African three-against-two (3:2) cross-rhythm, or hemiola. The song begins with the bass repeatedly playing 6 cross-beats per each measure of 12/8, or 6 cross-beats per 4 main beats—6:4 (two cells of 3:2). The following example shows the original ostinato &quot;Afro Blue&quot; bass line. The slashed noteheads indicate the main beats (not bass notes), where you would normally tap your foot to &quot;keep time.&quot;

===Bossa nova===
Bossa nova is a hybrid form based on the samba rhythm, but influenced by European and American music from Debussy to US jazz. Bossa nova originated in the 1950s, largely from the efforts of Brazilians Antonio Carlos Jobim and João Gilberto. Its most famous song is arguably &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; sung by Gilberto and his wife, Astrud Gilberto. While the musical style evolved from samba, it is more complex harmonically and less percussive. Bossa nova emerged primarily from the upscale beachside neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro as opposed to samba&#x27;s origins in the favelas of Rio. Certain similar elements were already evident, even influencing Western classical music like Gershwin&#x27;s Cuban Overture which has the characteristic &#x27;Latin&#x27; clave rhythm. The influence on bossa nova of jazz styles such as cool jazz is often debated by historians and fans, but a similar &quot;cool sensibility&quot; is apparent.

Bossa nova was developed in Brazil in the mid-1950s, with its creation being credited to artists including Johnny Alf, Antonio Carlos Jobim and João Gilberto. One of the first songs was &quot;Bim-Bom&quot;(Gilberto). Bossa nova was made popular by Dorival Caymmi&#x27;s &quot;Saudade da Bahia&quot; and Elizete Cardoso&#x27;s recording of &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot; on the &quot;Canção do Amor Demais&quot; LP, composed by Vinícius de Moraes (lyrics) and Antonio Carlos Jobim (music). The song was soon after released by Gilberto.

The initial releases by Gilberto and the internationally popular 1959 film &quot;Orfeu Negro&quot; (&quot;Black Orpheus&quot;, with score by Luiz Bonfá) brought significant popularity of this musical style in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America, which spread to North America via visiting American jazz musicians. The resulting recordings by Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz cemented its popularity and led to a worldwide boom with 1964&#x27;s &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;, numerous recordings by famous jazz performers such as Ella Fitzgerald (&quot;Ella Abraça Jobim&quot;) and Frank Sinatra (&quot;Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antônio Carlos Jobim&quot;). Since that time, the bossa nova style maintains a lasting influence in world music for several decades and even up to the present.

The first bossa nova single to achieve international popularity was perhaps the most successful of all time, the 1964 Getz/Gilberto recording &quot;The Girl From Ipanema&quot;, edited to include only the singing of Astrud Gilberto, Gilberto&#x27;s then wife. The genre would withstand substantial &quot;watering down&quot; by popular artists throughout the next four decades.

An early influence on bossa nova was the song &quot;Dans mon île&quot; by French singer Henri Salvador, featured in the 1957 Italian movie &quot;Europa di notte&quot; by Alessandro Blasetti; the song was distributed in Brazil and covered later by Brazilian artists Eumir Deodato (&quot;Los Danseros en Bolero&quot; – 1964) and Caetano Veloso (&quot;Outras Palavras&quot; – 1981). In 2005, Henri Salvador was awarded the Brazilian Order of Cultural Merit, which he received from singer and Minister of Culture, Gilberto Gil, in the presence of President Lula for his influence on Brazilian culture.

The so-called &quot;bossa nova clave&quot; (or &quot;Brazilian clave&quot;) is played on the snare rim of the drum kit in bossa nova. The pattern has a similar rhythm to that of the son clave, but the second note on the two-side is delayed by one pulse (subdivision). The pattern is shown below in 2/4, as it is written in Brazil. In North American charts it is more likely to be written in cut-time.

According to drummer Bobby Sanabria the Brazilian composer Antonio Carlos Jobim, who developed the pattern, considers it to be merely a rhythmic motif and not a clave (guide pattern). Jobim later regretted that Latino musicians misunderstood the role of this bossa nova pattern.

===Beyond Latin jazz===
Brazilian percussionist Airto Moreira became a professional musician at age 13. He won acclaim as a member of the samba jazz pioneers Sambalanço Trio and for his landmark recording &quot;Quarteto Novo&quot; with Hermeto Pascoal in 1967. Shortly after, he followed his wife Flora Purim to the United States. Once in the U.S., Airto introduced Afro-Brazilian folkloric instruments into a wide variety of jazz styles, in ways that had not been done before. In Chick Corea&#x27;s original Return to Forever band, Airto was able to showcase his samba prowess on several percussion instruments, including drum kit. However, the terms &quot;jazz samba&quot; or &quot;Latin jazz&quot; are too limiting a label for the types of music Airto participated in the U.S. during the 1970s. Airto played in the two most important avant-garde electric jazz bands of the day—Miles Davis and Weather Report. He also performed on more mainstream albums, such as those of CTI Records. Besides energetic rhythmic textures, Airto added percussion color, using bells, shakers, and whistles to create evocative textures of timbre. Airto paved the way for other avant garde Brazilian musicians such as Hermeto Pascoal, to enter the North American jazz scene.

Another innovative Brazilian percussionist is Naná Vasconcelos. Vasconcelos contributed to four Jon Hassell albums from 1976 to 1980 (including Possible Musics by Brian Eno and Hassell), and later to several Pat Metheny Group works and Jan Garbarek concerts from early 1980s to early 1990s. In 1976 joined Egberto Gismonti to record &quot;Dança das cabeças&quot; in ECM label. In 1984 he appeared on the Pierre Favre album &quot;Singing Drums&quot; along with Paul Motian. He also appears on Arild Andersen&#x27;s album &quot;If You Look Far Enough&quot; with Ralph Towner. Vasconcelos formed a group named Codona with Don Cherry and Collin Walcott, which released three albums in 1978, 1980 and 1982. While Vasconcelos uses Afro-Brazilian rhythms and instruments, he like Airto, transcend the categories of Brazilian jazz and Latin jazz.

==Comparing Latin jazz with straight-ahead jazz==
In comparison with straight-ahead jazz, Latin jazz employs straight rhythm (or &quot;even-eighths&quot;), rather than swung rhythm. Early Latin jazz rarely employed a backbeat, but contemporary forms fuse the backbeat with the clave. The conga, timbale, güiro, bongos, and claves are percussion instruments often used in addition to, or in place of the drum kit.

==Formats==
Latin jazz music, like most types of jazz music, can be played in small or large groups. Small groups, or combos, often use the bebop format made popular in the 1950s in America, where the musicians play a standard melody, many of the musicians play an improvised solo, and then everyone plays the melody again. Prominent Latin jazz big bands include Arturo O&#x27;Farrill&#x27;s Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, Bobby Sanabria&#x27;s Multiverse Big Band, Raices Jazz Orchestra, Mambo Legends Orchestra, Pacific Mambo Orchestra, as well as others. In Latin jazz bands, percussion is often featured in solos. Contemporary Latin jazz pieces by musicians such as Hermeto Pascoal are mostly composed for these small groups, with percussion solos as well as many wind-instrumentals.

== Latin Jazz as Global Music ==
Most jazz histories emphasize the narrative that jazz is exclusively an American music—a style created by African Americans in the early 20th century, fusing elements of African rhythm and improvisations with European instrumentation, harmonies, and formal structures. The influences of musics from the Caribbean and Latin America—save Jelly Roll Morton&#x27;s often quoted comments on the &quot;Spanish tinge&quot; rhythms of early New Orleans jazz, and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s famous Post-War collaborations with Afro-Cuban drummer Chano Pozo—have received little or no mention in standard jazz textbooks used in most American universities. Likewise, the influential 1973 compilation of recordings, the &quot;Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz,&quot; and Ken Burns&#x27; popular documentary film &quot;Jazz,&quot; make little mention of Latin jazz. More recent scholarship has challenged this paradigm, arguing that music from the Caribbean and Latin American were essential to the emergence of early New Orleans jazz, to the music&#x27;s Post-War development in New York City, and to the continued evolution of jazz in twenty-first century urban centers. Proponents of this view advocate for the inclusion of influential Caribbean band leaders including Frank Machito Grillo, Mario Bauzá, Chico O&#x27;Farrill, Tito Puente, Ray Barretto, and Jerry and Andy Gonzalez in the broader jazz cannon. From this perspective, all jazz, including Latin Jazz, is not viewed as a uniquely American expression, but rather as &quot;a global music&quot; that is &quot;transcultural in its stylistic scope.&quot;

<doc id="285711" wikidata="Q82687" url="?curid=285711" title="Géza I of Hungary">
<text>Géza I (; ; 104025 April 1077) was King of Hungary from 1074 until his death. He was the eldest son of King Béla I. His baptismal name was Magnus. With German assistance, Géza&#x27;s cousin Solomon acquired the crown when his father died in 1063, forcing Géza to leave Hungary. Géza returned with Polish reinforcements and signed a treaty with Solomon in early 1064. In the treaty, Géza and his brother Ladislaus acknowledged the rule of Solomon, who granted them their father&#x27;s former duchy, which encompassed one-third of the Kingdom of Hungary.

Géza closely cooperated with Solomon, but their relationship became tense from 1071. The king invaded the duchy in February 1074 and defeated Géza in a battle. However, Géza was victorious at the decisive battle of Mogyoród on 14 March 1074. He soon acquired the throne, although Solomon maintained his rule in the regions of Moson and Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia) for years. Géza initiated peace negotiations with his dethroned cousin in the last months of his life. Géza&#x27;s sons were children when he died and he was succeeded by his brother Ladislaus.

==Early years (before 1064)==
Géza was the eldest son of the future King Béla I of Hungary and his wife Richeza or Adelhaid, a daughter of King Mieszko II of Poland. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; narrates that Géza and his brother Ladislaus were born in Poland, where their father who had been banished from Hungary settled in the 1030s. Géza was born in about 1040. According to the historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk, he was named after his grandfather&#x27;s uncle Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians. His baptismal name was Magnus.

In about 1048, Géza&#x27;s father returned to Hungary and received one third of the kingdom with the title of duke from his brother, King Andrew I. Géza seems to have arrived in Hungary with his father. The king, who had not fathered a legitimate son, declared Béla his heir. According to the traditional principle of seniority, Béla preserved his claim to succeed his brother even after Andrew&#x27;s wife Anastasia of Kiev gave birth to Solomon in 1053. However, the king had his son crowned in 1057 or 1058. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; narrates that the child Solomon &quot;was anointed king with the consent of Duke Bela and his sons Geysa and Ladislaus&quot;, which is the first reference to a public act by Géza. However, according to the contemporaneous text &quot;Annales Altahenses&quot;, Géza was absent from the meeting where Judiththe sister of the German monarch Henry IVwas engaged to the child Solomon in 1058.

Géza accompanied his father, who left for Poland to seek assistance against King Andrew. They returned with Polish reinforcements in 1060. Géza was one of his father&#x27;s most influential advisors. Lampert of Hersfeld wrote that Géza persuaded his father to set free Count William of Weimar, one of the commanders of the German troops fighting on Andrew&#x27;s side, who had been captured in a battle.

The king died during the civil war; his partisans took Solomon to the Holy Roman Empire and Géza&#x27;s father Béla was crowned king on 6 December 1060. Although Géza remained his father&#x27;s principal advisor, King Béla did not grant his former duchy to his son. According to the &quot;Annales Altahenses&quot;, Béla even offered Géza as hostage to the Germans when he was informed that the German court decided, in August 1063, to invade Hungary to restore Solomon. However, the Germans refused Béla&#x27;s offer and he died on 11 September 1063, some days after the imperial troops entered Hungary.

Following his father&#x27;s death, Géza offered to accept Solomon&#x27;s rule if he received his father&#x27;s former duchy. This offer was refused, which forced him and his two brothersLadislaus and Lampertto leave Hungary for Poland. Duke Bolesław II of Poland provided them with reinforcements and they returned after the German troops were withdrawn from Hungary. The brothers wanted to avoid a new civil war and made an agreement with King Solomon. According to the treaty, which was signed in Győr on 20 January 1064, Géza and his brothers accepted Solomon&#x27;s rule and the king granted them their father&#x27;s duchy. The king and his cousins celebrated Easter together in the cathedral of Pécs, where Duke Géza ceremoniously put a crown on Solomon&#x27;s head.

==Duke in Hungary (1064–1074)==

According to Ján Steinhübel and other Slovak historians, Géza only retained the administration of the region of Nyitra (present-day Nitra, Slovakia) and gave the eastern territories of their father&#x27;s duchy, which were centered around Bihar (present-day Biharia, Romania), to his brother, Ladislaus. The Hungarian historian Gyula Kristó likewise says that this division of Béla&#x27;s one-time duchy is &quot;probable&quot;. The historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk write that Géza seems to have married a German countess named Sophia around this time. Géza had the right to coinage in his duchy. The silver half-denars minted for him bore the inscriptions &quot;DUX MAGNUS&quot; (&quot;Duke Magnus&quot;) and &quot;PANONAI&quot; (&quot;Kingdom of Hungary&quot;).

Géza closely cooperated with the king between 1064 and 1071. For instance, they jointly routed an invading army which had plundered the eastern territories of the kingdom at Kerlés (present-day Chiraleş, Romania) in 1068. The identification of the invaders is uncertain: the &quot;Annales Posonienses&quot; writes of Pechenegs, the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; and other 14th- and 15th-century Hungarian chronicles refer to Cumans, and a Russian chronicle identifies them as Cumans and Vlachs. Modern historians have concluded that they were Pechenegs.

Géza&#x27;s and Solomon&#x27;s relationship only began to worsen during the siege of the Byzantine fortress of Belgrade in 1071. Its commander preferred to surrender to Géza instead of the king, and the Byzantine envoys who arrived in the Hungarian camp after the fall of Belgrade only negotiated with Géza. The division of the booty also gave rise to a new conflict between Solomon and Géza. Although Géza accompanied the king on a new campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 1072, his brother Ladislaus stayed behind with half of the troops of their duchy.

The conflict between the king and his cousins was sharpened by Solomon&#x27;s main advisor, Count Vid, who wanted to acquire the dukes&#x27; domains for himself. However, Solomon and Géza, who were convinced that they needed foreign reinforcements before attacking the other party, concluded a truce which was to last from 11 November 1073 to 24 April 1075. Géza sent his brothers to Poland and Rus&#x27; to seek assistance against Solomon. At a meeting in the Szekszárd Abbey, Count Vid persuaded the king to break the truce in order to unexpectedly attack Géza who was &quot;hunting in Igfan Forest&quot; to the east of the river Tisza. Although the abbot of the monastery, which had been established by Géza&#x27;s father, warned the duke of the king&#x27;s plans, the royal army crossed the river and routed Géza&#x27;s troops in the battle of Kemej on 26 February 1074.

A legend preserved in the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; mentions that before the battle, Ladislaus &quot;saw in broad daylight a vision from heaven&quot; of an angel placing a crown on Géza&#x27;s head. Another legendary episode also predicted the dukes&#x27; triumph over the king: an &quot;ermine of purest white&quot; jumped from a thorny bush to Ladislaus&#x27;s lance and then onto his chest.

From the battlefield, Géza and his retinue hastened towards Vác where he came upon his brother Ladislaus and their brother-in-law, Duke Otto I of Olomouc. The latter, accompanied by Czech reinforcements, arrived in Hungary in order to assist Géza against Solomon. In the ensuing battle, fought at Mogyoród on 14 March 1074, Géza &quot;with the troops from Nitria was stationed in the centre&quot;, according to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;. During the battle, Géza and Ladislaus changed their standards in order to bewilder Solomon who was planning to attack Géza. Géza and his allies won a decisive victory and forced the king to flee from the battlefield and to withdraw to Moson at the western frontier of Hungary. Géza &quot;made&quot; Kapuvár, Babót, Székesfehérvár and &quot;other castles secure with garrisons of the bravest soldiers&quot;, thus taking possession of almost the entire kingdom.

==His reign (1074–1077)==

Legend says that Géza decided to build a church dedicated to the Holy Virgin in Vác after Ladislaus explained the significance of the wondrous appearance of a red deer at the place where the church would be erected:

According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, Géza accepted the throne &quot;at the insistence of the Hungarians&quot; after Solomon had taken refuge in Moson. However, he was not crowned because the royal jewels were still in the dethroned king&#x27;s possession. The German monarch Henry IV, who was Solomon&#x27;s brother-in-law, launched an expedition against Hungary in mid-1074. The Germans marched as far as Vác, but Géza applied scorched earth tactics and bribed German commanders, who persuaded the German monarch to retreat from Hungary.

In early 1074, Géza had approached Pope Gregory VII to obtain international recognition of his rule. However, the pope wanted to take advantage of the conflict between Solomon and Géza and attempted to persuade both of them to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Holy See. Géza did not obey the pope and asked the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Doukas for a crown. The emperor sent Géza a gold and enamel diadem, which bore the legend &quot;Géza, the faithful king of Hungary&quot; on one of its plaques. This &quot;splendid work of art&quot; became the lower part of the Holy Crown of Hungary by the end of the 12th century. Géza was crowned king with this diadem in early 1075. In this year he styled himself as &quot;anointed king of the Hungarians by the grace of God&quot; in the charter of the foundation of the Benedictine Abbey of Garamszentbenedek (present-day Hronský Beňadik, Slovakia).

Géza married a niece of Nikephoros Botaneiates, a close advisor of Emperor Michael VII. However, Solomon still controlled Moson and Pressburg; the royal troopswhich were under the command of Géza&#x27;s brother, Ladislauscould not take Pressburg in 1076. According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, Géza considered renouncing the crown in favor of Solomon from the end of the year. Géza died on 25 April 1077 and was buried in the cathedral of Vác, which he had erected in honor of the Holy Virgin. His brother Ladislaus succeeded him. A grave discovered in the center of the medieval cathedral in August 2015 was identified as Géza&#x27;s burial site by Zoltán Batizi, the leader of the excavations.

==Family==
Géza married twice. The family of his first wife Sophia, whom he married in the late 1060s, is unknown. After his coronation in 1075, he married his second wife Synadene, who was the maternal niece of the future Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros III Botaneiates.
It is uncertain which wife bore Géza&#x27;s children, but the historians Gyula Kristó and Márta Font say that Sophia was their mother. Kristó adds that Géza fathered at least six children. Although only two of themColoman and Álmosare known by name, the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; states that Coloman had brothers who &quot;died before him&quot;. Both Coloman and Álmos were apparently born around 1070.

The following family tree presents Géza&#x27;s ancestors and some of his relatives who are mentioned in the article.



&quot;*Whether Géza&#x27;s first or second wife was his children&#x27;s mother is uncertain.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;**Géza had at least two further children, but their names are unknown.&quot;

<text>Joseph William Namath (; ; born May 31, 1943), nicknamed &quot;Broadway Joe&quot;, is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons. He spent the majority of his career with the New York Jets. Namath played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide, where he won the national championship as a senior, and was selected by the Jets first overall in the 1965 AFL draft.

During his five AFL seasons, Namath was a two-time MVP and twice led the league in passing yards, while winning one AFL championship and one Super Bowl. Both victories remain the Jets&#x27; only championships. Following the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, he joined the NFL with the Jets, where he was the league&#x27;s passing yards and touchdowns leader during the 1972 season. He played in New York for seven more seasons and spent his final year as a member of the Los Angeles Rams.

Namath cemented his legacy in 1969 when he guaranteed his heavy underdog Jets would win Super Bowl III before defeating the NFL&#x27;s Baltimore Colts in one of the greatest sports upsets of all time. The Super Bowl victory was the first for an AFL franchise, helping dismiss notions that its teams were inferior to the NFL&#x27;s and demonstrating they would enter the merger as equals. Namath received Super Bowl MVP honors in the game, while also becoming the first quarterback to win both a college national championship and a major professional championship. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985.

==Early life==
Namath was born and raised in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, 30 miles (50 km) northwest of Pittsburgh. He grew up in the Lower End neighborhood of Beaver Falls. He is the son of Catholic parents, Rose (née Juhász) and János &quot;John Andrew&quot; Namath, a steelworker, both of Hungarian descent. His Hungarian-born grandfather, András &quot;Andrew&quot; Németh, known as &quot;A.J.&quot; to his family and friends, came to Ellis Island on the steamer in 1911, and worked in the coal and steel industries of the Greater Pittsburgh area.

While growing up, Namath was close to both of his parents, who eventually divorced. Following his parents&#x27; divorce, he lived with his mother. He was the youngest of four sons, with an older adopted sister.

Namath excelled in all sports at Beaver Falls High School and was a standout quarterback in football, guard in basketball, and outfielder in baseball. In an age when dunks were uncommon in high school basketball, Namath regularly dunked in games. Namath later clarified a story about being the only white player on his high school basketball team on &quot;The James Brown Show&quot; in 2018, where he was the guest. He stated that although he was one of several white players on the team, he was the only white starter. Coached by Larry Bruno at Beaver Falls, Namath&#x27;s football team won the WPIAL Class AA championship with a 9–0 record in 1960. Coach Bruno later presented Namath to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton.

Upon graduation from high school in 1961, he received offers from several Major League Baseball teams, including the Yankees, Indians, Reds, Pirates, and Phillies, but football prevailed. Namath told interviewers that he wanted to sign with the Pirates and play baseball like his idol, Roberto Clemente, but elected to play football because his mother wanted him to get a college education. He enrolled at the University of Alabama, but left before graduating in order to pursue a career in professional football. However, a college degree was finally conferred on Namath at age 64, after he completed an external-program Bachelor of Arts degree in interdisciplinary studies at the University of Alabama in 2007.

Namath had many offers from Division I college football programs, including Penn State, Ohio State, Alabama, and Notre Dame, but initially decided upon the University of Maryland after being heavily recruited by Maryland assistant coach Roland Arrigoni. He was rejected by Maryland because his college-board scores were just below the school&#x27;s requirements. After ample recruiting by Coach Paul &#x27;Bear&#x27; Bryant, Namath accepted a full scholarship to attend Alabama. Bryant stated his decision to recruit Namath was &quot;the best coaching decision I ever made.&quot;

==College football career==
Between 1962 and 1964, Namath quarterbacked the Alabama Crimson Tide program under Bryant and his offensive coordinator, Howard Schnellenberger. A year after being suspended for the final two games of the regular season, Namath led the Tide to a national championship in 1964. During his time at the University of Alabama, Namath led the team to a 29–4 record over three seasons.

Bryant called Namath &quot;the greatest athlete I ever coached&quot;. When Namath was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985, he teared up during his induction speech upon mentioning Bryant, who had died of a heart attack in 1983.

Namath attended college at the height of the civil rights movement (1955–1968) in the Southern United States.

Namath was eleventh in the voting for the 1964 Heisman Trophy, which was won by quarterback John Huarte of Notre Dame.

===Statistics===
==Professional football career==
In 1964, despite suffering a nagging knee injury in the fourth game of his senior year at Alabama, Namath limped through the undefeated regular season to the Orange Bowl. The cartilage damage to Namath&#x27;s right knee later designated him class 4-F for the military draft, a deferment from service during the Vietnam War.

In late 1964 the then still separate NFL and upstart AFL were at the height of their bidding war, and held their respective drafts on the same day, November 28. Namath was a first-round draft selection by both leagues: the St. Louis Cardinals selected him 12th overall in the 1965 NFL draft, while the Jets made him the first overall pick in the AFL draft.

When meeting with executives of the Cardinals, Namath&#x27;s salary request was $200,000 and a new Lincoln Continental. While initially surprised at Namath&#x27;s demands, the Cardinals told Namath they would agree to his terms only if he would sign before the Orange Bowl, which would have made Namath ineligible to play in the game. The day after the Orange Bowl, Namath elected to sign with the Jets, under the direction of Sonny Werblin, for a salary of US$427,000 over three years (a pro football record at the time). Offensive tackle Sherman Plunkett came up with the nickname &quot;Broadway Joe&quot; in 1965, following Namath&#x27;s appearance on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in July.

===New York Jets===
In Namath&#x27;s rookie season the 1965 Jets were winless in their first six games with him splitting time with second-year quarterback Mike Taliaferro. With Namath starting full-time they won five of the last eight of a fourteen-game season and Namath was named the AFL Rookie of the year.

He became the first professional quarterback to pass for 4,000 yards in a season when he threw for 4,007 yards during a 14-game season in 1967, a record broken by Dan Fouts in a 16-game season in 1979 (4,082). Although Namath was plagued with knee injuries through much of his career and underwent four pioneering knee operations by Dr. James A. Nicholas, he was an AFL All-Star in 1965, 1967, 1968, and 1969. On some occasions, Namath had to have his knee drained at halftime so he could finish a game. Later in life, long after he left football, he underwent knee replacement surgery on both legs.

In the 1968 AFL title game, Namath threw three touchdown passes to lead New York to a 27–23 win over the defending AFL champion Oakland Raiders. His performance in the 1968 season earned him the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year. He was an AFC–NFC Pro Bowler in 1972, is a member of the Jets&#x27; and the American Football League&#x27;s All-Time Team, and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1985.

====Super Bowl III====
The high point of Namath&#x27;s career was his performance in the Jets&#x27; 16–7 win over the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III in January 1969, shortly before the AFL–NFL merger. The first two interleague championship games had resulted in blowout victories for the NFL&#x27;s Green Bay Packers, and sports writers from NFL cities insisted the AFL would take several more years to be truly competitive. The 1968 Colts were touted as &quot;the greatest football team in history&quot;, and former NFL star and Atlanta Falcons head coach Norm Van Brocklin ridiculed the AFL before the game, saying &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what I think about Joe Namath on Sunday night—after he has played his first pro game.&quot; Three days before the game, Namath was tired of addressing the issue in the press, and he responded to a heckler at a sports banquet in Miami with the line: &quot;We&#x27;re going to win the game. I guarantee it.&quot;

Namath backed up his boast, which became legendary. The Colts&#x27; vaunted defense (highlighted by Bubba Smith) was unable to contain either the Jets&#x27; running or passing game, while the ineffective offense gave up four interceptions to the Jets. Namath was the Super Bowl MVP, completing eight passes to George Sauer Jr. alone for 133 yards. The win made him the first quarterback to start and win a national championship game in college, a major professional league championship, and a Super Bowl.

The Jets&#x27; win gave the AFL instant legitimacy even to skeptics. When he was asked by reporters after the game whether the Colts&#x27; defense was the &quot;toughest he had ever faced&quot;, Namath responded, &quot;That would be the Buffalo Bills&#x27; defense.&quot; The AFL-worst Bills had intercepted Namath five times, three for touchdowns, in their only win in 1968 in late September.

====Later career with the Jets====
After not missing a single game because of injury in his first five years in the league, Namath played in just 28 of 58 possible games between 1970 and 1973 because of various injuries. After winning division championships in 1968 and 1969, the Jets struggled to records of 4–10, 6–8, 7–7, and 4–10. His most memorable moment in those four seasons came on September 24, 1972, when he and his boyhood idol Johnny Unitas combined for 872 passing yards in Baltimore. Namath threw for 496 yards and six touchdowns and Unitas 376 yards and three in a 44–34 New York victory over the Colts, its first against Baltimore since Super Bowl III. The game is considered by many NFL experts to be the finest display of passing in a single game in league history. Another notable moment was in 1970, when the head of ABC&#x27;s televised sports, Roone Arledge, made sure that &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;&#x27;s inaugural game on September 21, featured Namath. The Jets met the Cleveland Browns in Cleveland Municipal Stadium in front of both a record crowd of 85,703 and a huge television audience. However, the Jets set a team record for penalties and lost on a late Namath interception.

The Chicago Winds of the World Football League (WFL) made an overture to Namath prior to the start of its 1975 season. First, they designed their uniforms nearly identically to that of the Jets, dropping red and going with green and white, to allow Namath to continue marketing his number 12 jersey in Jets colors. Then they offered Namath a contract worth $600,000 a year for three years; a $2 million annuity ($100,000 per year for 20 years); a $500,000 signing bonus; and terms for Namath&#x27;s eventual ownership of a WFL franchise. The WFL&#x27;s television provider, TVS Television Network, insisted on the Winds signing Namath to continue broadcasts. Upon this development, Namath, in turn, requested the lofty sum of 15 percent of the entire league&#x27;s television revenue, which was rejected by the league. Without a national television deal, the WFL instead opted to fold a month later.

===Los Angeles Rams===
After twelve years with the Jets, Namath was waived prior to the 1977 season to facilitate a move to the Los Angeles Rams when a trade could not be worked out. Signing on May 12, Namath hoped to revitalize his career, but knee injuries, a bad hamstring, and the general ravages of 13 years as a quarterback in professional football had taken their toll. After playing well in a 2–1 start, Namath took a beating in a one-point road loss on a cold, windy, and rainy &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Chicago Bears, throwing four interceptions and having a fifth nullified by a penalty. He was benched as a starter for the rest of the season (in favor of Pat Haden) and retired at its end.

==Career statistics==


==Acting career==
Building on his brief success as a host on 1969&#x27;s &quot;The Joe Namath Show&quot;, Namath transitioned into an acting career. Appearing on stage, starring in several movies, including &quot;C.C. and Company&quot; with Ann-Margret and William Smith in 1970, on stage in &quot;Picnic&quot; with Donna Mills in 1971 and in a brief 1978 television series, &quot;The Waverly Wonders&quot;. He guest-starred on numerous television shows, often as himself, including &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot;, &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;ALF&quot;, &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot;, and &quot;The John Larroquette Show&quot;. Namath was a candidate to host the 1988 revival of the American game show &quot;Family Feud&quot;, before the job went to comedian Ray Combs.

Namath appeared in summer stock productions of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, and &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, and finally legitimized his &quot;Broadway Joe&quot; nickname as a cast replacement in a New York revival of &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court Martial&quot; in 1983. He guest hosted &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; several times and also served as a color commentator on NFL broadcasts, including the 1985 season of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; and several years with NBC Sports. In September 2012, Namath was honored by the Ride of Fame and a double-decker tour bus was dedicated to him in New York City. He appeared as himself in the 2013 sports film &quot;Underdogs&quot; and the 2015 comedy film &quot;The Wedding Ringer&quot;.

===Filmography===


==Personal life==
Namath was the only athlete listed on the master list of Richard Nixon&#x27;s political opponents, which was made public in 1973 during the Watergate investigation, erroneously listed as playing for the New York Giants. White House Counsel John Dean claimed not to know why Namath was included on the list and suggested that it might have been a mistake. Namath addressed this on &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot; on July 20, 1973.

Namath dated actress and fashion model Randi Oakes, actress and lawyer Louisa Moritz, singer and songwriter Janis Joplin, and actresses Jill St. John and Raquel Welch.

While taking a voice class in 1983, Namath met Deborah Mays, who later changed her first name to May and then changed it again to Tatiana, an aspiring actress; he was 39 and she was 22. They married in 1984, with Namath claiming, &quot;She caught my last pass.&quot; The longtime bachelor became a dedicated family man when the couple had two children, Jessica (born 1986) and Olivia (born 1991). The couple divorced in 2000, with the children living in Florida with their father. In May 2007, Olivia gave birth to a daughter, Natalia. Olivia lives in California with her three kids. Namath also has three other grandchildren named John, Emerson, and Jemma, who live next to him with their mother, Jessica. Namath practices transcendental meditation and has adopted a collie/shepherd, Zoie, from a local rescue shelter. He co-owns the Lucky Shuck, a waterside restaurant overlooking the Jupiter Inlet and lighthouse.

For the early years of his marriage, Namath continued to struggle with his alcoholism until his wife warned him that he could break up his family if he continued. By 1987, Namath was able to stop his drinking, though he would relapse after his divorce in 2000.

On December 20, 2003, Namath garnered unfavorable publicity after he consumed too much alcohol during a day that was dedicated to the Jets&#x27; announcement of their All-Time team. During live ESPN coverage of the team&#x27;s game, Namath was asked about then-Jets quarterback Chad Pennington and his thoughts on the difficulties of that year&#x27;s team. Namath expressed confidence in Pennington, but then stated to interviewer Suzy Kolber, &quot;I want to kiss you. I couldn&#x27;t care less about the team struggling.&quot; He subsequently apologized, and several weeks later entered into an outpatient alcoholism treatment program. In 2019, Namath said he used the incident as motivation to quit alcohol, explaining &quot;I had embarrassed my friends and family and could not escape that feeling. I haven&#x27;t had a drink since.&quot;

In July 2015, Namath joined the search for two boys who disappeared during a fishing trip off the coast of Florida, and offered a $100,000 reward for the safe return of the boys. The boat was found six days later, and the search was suspended, with the two boys presumed dead.

On June 6, 2018, Namath threw out the first pitch at a Chicago Cubs baseball game at Wrigley Field. The pitch was caught by then-Cubs manager Joe Maddon, who idolized Namath as a child. This was Namath&#x27;s first time at Wrigley Field.

===Bachelors III===
After the Super Bowl victory in 1969, Namath opened a popular Upper East Side nightclub called Bachelors III, which not only drew big names in sports, entertainment, and politics, but also organized crime. To protect the league&#x27;s reputation, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle ordered Namath to divest himself of his interest in the venture. Namath refused, apparently retiring from football during a teary news conference, but he eventually recanted and agreed to sell the club, and reported to the Jets in time for the 1969–70 season. Namath again threatened to retire before the 1970 and 1971 seasons; &quot;New York&quot; wrote in 1971 that &quot;his retirement act had become shallow and predictable&quot;. The magazine stated that Namath did not want to attend training camp because of the risk of injury, but could not afford to retire permanently because of poor investments.

==Legacy==
===Media and advertising icon===
Namath&#x27;s prowess on the field, fashion sense, lighthearted personality, and status as a sex symbol made him the first sports figure to appeal equally to men, women, and children—as demonstrated by his various product endorsements over the years. His nickname &quot;Broadway Joe&quot; was given to him by Sherman Plunkett, a Jets teammate. &quot;Joe Willie Namath&quot; was Namath&#x27;s moniker based on his full given name and was popularized by sportscaster Howard Cosell. On the field, Namath stood out from other AFL and NFL players in low-cut white shoes rather than traditional black high-tops. The white shoes started when Namath was at Alabama, where he kept having his worn-out cleats taped over as a superstition, especially after his first major knee injury was the result of a game in which he had forgotten to have the shoes taped. When he joined the Jets, Namath continued to have his shoes taped until Jets coach Weeb Ewbank noticed that the excess tape usage was costing the team money, so he ordered white cleats for Namath. He originated the fad of wearing a full-length fur coat on the sidelines (since banned by the NFL, which requires all players, coaches, athletic trainers, et al., to wear league-approved team apparel).

Namath also appeared in television advertisements both during and after his playing career, most notably for Ovaltine milk flavoring, Noxzema shaving cream (in which he was shaved by a then-unknown Farrah Fawcett), and Hanes Beautymist pantyhose (which he famously wore in the commercials). All of these commercials contributed to his becoming a pop-culture icon.

Namath continues to serve as an unofficial spokesman and goodwill ambassador of the Jets. In 2011, Namath was representing Topps and promoting a &quot;Super Bowl Legends&quot; contest, appearing on its behalf on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. For Super Bowl XLVIII which was hosted in the Jets&#x27; MetLife Stadium, Namath and his daughter Jessica wore fur coats for the ceremonial coin toss to &quot;bring back a little of that flash from his heyday&quot; as a player.

On June 2, 2013, Namath was the guest speaker at the Pro Football Hall of Fame, unveiling the Canton, Ohio museum&#x27;s $27 million expansion and renovation plan.

As of 2018, Namath is the spokesperson for the insurance agency Medicare Coverage Helpline.

===Biographies===
In November 2006, the biography &quot;Namath: A Biography&quot; by Mark Kriegel was published, reaching the &quot;New York Times&quot; extended bestseller list (number 23). In conjunction with its release, Namath was interviewed for the November 19, 2006, edition of CBS&#x27; &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. A documentary about Namath&#x27;s hometown of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, includes a segment on Namath and why the city has celebrated its ties to him. In 2009, 40 years after winning Super Bowl III, he presented the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the Pittsburgh Steelers, who won Super Bowl XLIII. NFL Productions also produced a two-hour long television biography in its &quot;A Football Life&quot; series.

<doc id="285718" wikidata="Q32365" url="?curid=285718" title="Last mile (telecommunications)">
<text>The last mile, or last kilometer, in the telecommunications, cable television and internet industries refers to the final leg of a telecommunications network that delivers telecommunication services to retail end-users (customers). More specifically, &quot;last mile&quot; describes the portion of the telecommunications network chain that physically reaches the end-user&#x27;s premises. Examples are the copper wire subscriber lines connecting landline telephones to the local telephone exchange; coaxial cable service drops carrying cable television signals from utility poles to subscribers&#x27; homes, and cell towers linking local cell phones to the cellular network. The word &quot;mile&quot; is used metaphorically; the length of the last mile link may be more or less than a mile. Because the last mile of a network to the user is conversely the first mile from the user&#x27;s premises to the outside world when the user is sending data, the term first mile is also alternatively used.

The last mile is typically the speed bottleneck in communication networks; its bandwidth effectively limits the amount of data that can be delivered to the customer. This is because retail telecommunications networks have the topology of &quot;trees&quot;, with relatively few high capacity &quot;trunk&quot; communication channels branching out to feed many final mile &quot;twigs&quot;. The final mile links, being the most numerous and thus the most expensive part of the system, as well as having to interface with a wide variety of user equipment, are the most difficult to upgrade to new technology. For example, telephone trunklines that carry phone calls between switching centers are made of modern optical fiber, but the last mile is typically twisted pair wires, a technology which has essentially remained unchanged for over a century since the original laying of copper phone cables.

In recent years, usage of the term &quot;last mile&quot; has expanded outside the communications industries, to include other distribution networks that deliver goods to customers, such as the pipes that deliver water and natural gas to customer premises, and the final legs of mail and package delivery services. The term has also been used to describe education and training providers that more tightly link individuals with job opportunities. In the last several years &quot;last mile&quot; has been used in the context of AI to refer to where algorithms require last mile customization or human judgement.

==Existing delivery system problems==
The increasing worldwide demand for rapid, low-latency and high-volume communication of information to homes and businesses has made economical information distribution and delivery increasingly important. As demand has escalated, particularly fueled by the widespread adoption of the Internet, the need for economical high-speed access by end-users located at millions of locations has ballooned as well.

As requirements have changed, the existing systems and networks that were initially pressed into service for this purpose have proven to be inadequate. To date, although a number of approaches have been tried, no single clear solution to the &#x27;last mile problem&#x27; has emerged.

As expressed by Shannon&#x27;s equation for channel information capacity, the omnipresence of noise in information systems sets a minimum signal-to-noise ratio (shortened as S/N) requirement in a channel, even when adequate spectral bandwidth is available. Since the integral of the rate of information transfer with respect to time is information quantity, this requirement leads to a corresponding minimum energy per bit. The problem of sending any given amount of information across a channel can therefore be viewed in terms of sending sufficient Information-Carrying Energy (ICE). For this reason the concept of an ICE &#x27;pipe&#x27; or &#x27;conduit&#x27; is relevant and useful for examining existing systems.

The distribution of information to a great number of widely separated end-users can be compared to the distribution of many other resources. Some familiar analogies are:
*Blood distribution to a large number of cells over a system of veins, arteries and capillaries
*Water distribution by a drip irrigation system to individual plants, including rivers, aqueducts, water mains, etc.
*Nourishment to a plant&#x27;s leaves through roots, trunk and branches.

All of these have in common conduits that carry a relatively small amount of a resource a short distance to a very large number of physically separated endpoints. Also common are conduits supporting more voluminous flow, which combine and carry many individual portions over much greater distances. The shorter, lower-volume conduits, which individually serve only one or a small fraction of the endpoints, may have far greater combined length than the larger capacity ones. These common attributes are shown to the right.

===Costs and efficiency===
The high-capacity conduits in these systems tend to also have in common the ability to efficiently transfer the resource over a long distance. Only a small fraction of the resource being transferred is wasted, lost, or misdirected. The same cannot necessarily be said of lower-capacity conduits.

One reason has to do with the efficiency of scale. Conduits that are located closer to the endpoint, or end-user, do not individually have as many users supporting them. Even though they are smaller, each has the overhead of an &quot;installation&quot; obtaining and maintaining a suitable path over which the resource can flow. The funding and resources supporting these smaller conduits tend to come from the immediate locale.

This can have the advantage of a &quot;small-government model&quot;. That is, the management and resources for these conduits is provided by local entities and therefore can be optimized to achieve the best solutions in the immediate environment and also to make best use of local resources. However, the lower operating efficiencies and relatively greater installation expenses, compared with the transfer capacities, can cause these smaller conduits, as a whole, to be the most expensive and difficult part of the complete distribution system.

These characteristics have been displayed in the birth, growth, and funding of the Internet. The earliest inter-computer communication tended to be accomplished with direct wireline connections between individual computers. These grew into clusters of small local area networks (LAN). The TCP/IP suite of protocols was born out of the need to connect several of these LANs together, particularly as related to common projects among the United States Department of Defense, industry and some academic institutions.

ARPANET came into being to further these interests. In addition to providing a way for multiple computers and users to share a common inter-LAN connection, the TCP/IP protocols provided a standardized way for dissimilar computers and operating systems to exchange information over this inter-network. The funding and support for the connections among LANs could be spread over one or even several LANs.

As each new LAN, or subnet, was added, the new subnet&#x27;s constituents enjoyed access to the greater network. At the same time the new subnet enabled access to any network or networks with which it was already networked. Thus the growth became a mutually inclusive or &quot;win-win&quot; event.

====Economies of scale====
In general, economy of scale makes an increase in capacity of a conduit less expensive as the capacity is increased. There is an overhead associated with the creation of any conduit. This overhead is not repeated as capacity is increased within the potential of the technology being utilized.

As the Internet has grown in size, by some estimates doubling in the number of users every eighteen months, economy of scale has resulted in increasingly large information conduits providing the longest distance and highest capacity backbone connections. In recent years, the capacity of fiber-optic communication, aided by a supporting industry, has resulted in an expansion of raw capacity, so much so that in the United States a large amount of installed fiber infrastructure is not being used because it is currently excess capacity &quot;dark fiber&quot;.

This excess backbone capacity exists in spite of the trend of increasing per-user data rates and overall quantity of data. Initially, only the inter-LAN connections were high speed. End-users used existing telephone lines and modems, which were capable of data rates of only a few hundred bit/s. Now almost all end users enjoy access at 100 or more times those early rates.

==Economical information transfer==
Before considering the characteristics of existing last-mile information delivery mechanisms, it is important to further examine what makes information conduits effective. As the Shannon–Hartley theorem shows, it is the combination of bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio which determines the maximum information rate of a channel. The product of the average information rate and time yields total information transfer. In the presence of noise, this corresponds to some amount of transferred information-carrying energy (ICE). Therefore, the economics of information transfer may be viewed in terms of the economics of the transfer of ICE.

Effective last-mile conduits must:
#Deliver signal power, S — (must have adequate signal power capacity).
#Experience low loss (low occurrence of conversion to unusable energy forms).
#Support wide transmission bandwidth.
#Deliver high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) — low unwanted-signal (Noise) power, N.
#Provide nomadic connectivity.

In addition to these factors, a good solution to the last-mile problem must provide each user:
#High availability and reliability.
#Low latency; latency must be small compared with required interaction times.
#High per-user capacity.
##A conduit which is shared among multiple end-users must provide a correspondingly higher capacity in order to properly support each individual user. This must be true for information transfer in each direction.
##Affordability; suitable capacity must be financially viable.

==Existing last mile delivery systems==

===Wired systems (including optical fiber)===
Wired systems provide guided conduits for Information-Carrying Energy (ICE). They all have some degree of shielding, which limits their susceptibility to external noise sources. These transmission lines have losses which are proportional to length. Without the addition of periodic amplification, there is some maximum length beyond which all of these systems fail to deliver an adequate S/N ratio to support information flow. Dielectric optical fiber systems support heavier flow at higher cost.

====Local area networks (LAN)====
Traditional wired local area networking systems require copper coaxial cable or a twisted pair to be run between or among two or more of the nodes in the network. Common systems operate at 100 Mbit/s, and newer ones also support 1000 Mbit/s or more. While length may be limited by collision detection and avoidance requirements, signal loss and reflections over these lines also define a maximum distance. The decrease in information capacity made available to an individual user is roughly proportional to the number of users sharing a LAN.

====Telephone====
In the late 20th century, improvements in the use of existing copper telephone lines increased their capabilities if maximum line length is controlled. With support for higher transmission bandwidth and improved modulation, these digital subscriber line schemes have increased capability 20-50 times as compared to the previous voiceband systems. These methods are not based on altering the fundamental physical properties and limitations of the medium, which, apart from the introduction of twisted pairs, are no different today than when the first telephone exchange was opened in 1877 by the Bell Telephone Company.

The history and long life of copper-based communications infrastructure is both a testament to the ability to derive new value from simple concepts through technological innovation – and a warning that copper communications infrastructure is beginning to offer diminishing returns for continued investment. However one of the largest costs associated with maintaining an ageing copper infrastructure is that of truck roll - sending engineers to physically test, repair, replace and provide new copper connections, and this cost is particularly prevalent in providing rural broadband service over copper. New technologies such as G.Fast and VDSL2 offer viable high speed solutions to rural broadband provision over existing copper. In light of this many companies have developed automated cross connects (cabinet based automated distribution frames) to eliminate the uncertainty and cost associated with maintaining broadband services over existing copper, these systems usually incorporate some form of automated switching and some include test functionality allowing an ISP representative to complete operations previously requiring a site visit (truck roll) from the central office via a web interface. In many countries the last mile link which connects landline business telephone customers to the local telephone exchange is often an ISDN30 which can carry 30 simultaneous telephone calls.

====CATV====
Community antenna television systems, also known as cable television, have been expanded to provide bidirectional communication over existing physical cables. However, they are by nature shared systems and the spectrum available for reverse information flow and achievable S/N are limited. As was done for initial unidirectional TV communication, cable loss is mitigated through the use of periodic amplifiers within the system. These factors set an upper limit on per-user information capacity, particularly when many users share a common section of cable or access network.

====Optical fiber====

Fiber offers high information capacity and after the turn of the 21st century became the deployed medium of choice (&quot;Fiber to the &quot;x&quot;&quot;) given its scalability in the face of the increasing bandwidth requirements of modern applications.

In 2004, according to Richard Lynch, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of the telecom giant Verizon, the company saw the world moving toward vastly higher bandwidth applications as consumers loved everything broadband had to offer and eagerly devoured as much as they could get, including two-way, user-generated content. Copper and coaxial networks would not – in fact, could not – satisfy these demands, which precipitated Verizon&#x27;s aggressive move into fiber-to-the-home via FiOS.

Fiber is a future-proof technology that meets the needs of today&#x27;s users, but unlike other copper-based and wireless last-mile mediums, also has the capacity for years to come, by upgrading the end-point optics and electronics without changing the fiber infrastructure. The fiber itself is installed on existing pole or conduit infrastructure and most of the cost is in labor, providing good regional economic stimulus in the deployment phase and providing a critical foundation for future regional commerce.

Fixed copper lines have been subject to theft due to the value of copper, but optical fibers make unattractive targets. Optical fibers cannot be converted into anything else, whereas copper can be recycled without loss.

===Wireless delivery systems===
Mobile CDN coined the term the &#x27;mobile mile&#x27; to categorize the last mile connection when a wireless system is used to reach the customer. In contrast to wired delivery systems, wireless systems use unguided waves to transmit ICE. They all tend to be unshielded and have a greater degree of susceptibility to unwanted signal and noise sources.

Because these waves are not guided but diverge, in free space these systems are attenuated following an inverse-square law, inversely proportional to distance squared. Losses thus increase more slowly with increasing length than for wired systems, whose loss increases exponentially. In a free space environment, beyond a given length, the losses in a wireless system are lower than those in a wired system.

In practice, the presence of atmosphere, and especially obstructions caused by terrain, buildings and foliage can greatly increase the loss above the free space value. Reflection, refraction and diffraction of waves can also alter their transmission characteristics and require specialized systems to accommodate the accompanying distortions.

Wireless systems have an advantage over wired systems in last mile applications in not requiring lines to be installed. However, they also have a disadvantage in that their unguided nature makes them more susceptible to unwanted noise and signals. Spectral reuse can therefore be limited.

====Lightwaves and free-space optics====
Visible and infrared light waves are much shorter than radio frequency waves. Their use to transmit data is referred to as free-space optical communication. Being short, light waves can be focused or collimated with a small lens/antenna, and to a much higher degree than radio waves. Thus, a receiving device can recover a greater portion of the transmitted signal.

Also, because of the high frequency, a high data transfer rate may be available. However, in practical last mile environments, obstructions and de-steering of these beams, and absorption by elements of the atmosphere including fog and rain, particularly over longer paths, can greatly restrict their use for last-mile wireless communications.

====Radio waves====
Radio frequencies (RF), from low frequencies through the microwave region, have wavelengths much longer than visible light. Although this means that it is not possible to focus the beams nearly as tightly as for light, it also means that the aperture or &quot;capture area&quot; of even the simplest, omnidirectional antenna is significantly larger than that of a lens in any feasible optical system. This characteristic results in greatly increased attenuation or &quot;path loss&quot; for systems that are not highly directional.

Actually, the term path loss is something of a misnomer because no energy is lost on a free-space path. Rather, it is merely not received by the receiving antenna. The apparent reduction in transmission, as frequency is increased, is an artifact of the change in the aperture of a given type of antenna.

Relative to the last-mile problem, these longer wavelengths have an advantage over light waves when omnidirectional or sectored transmissions are considered. The larger aperture of radio antennas results in much greater signal levels for a given path length and therefore higher information capacity. On the other hand, the lower carrier frequencies are not able to support the high information bandwidths, which are required by Shannon&#x27;s equation when the practical limits of S/N have been reached.

For the above reasons, wireless radio systems are optimal for lower-information-capacity broadcast communications delivered over longer paths. For high-information capacity, highly-directive point-to-point over short ranges, wireless light-wave systems are the most useful.

====One-way (broadcast) radio and television communications====
Historically, most high-information-capacity broadcast has used lower frequencies, generally no higher than the UHF television region, with television itself being a prime example. Terrestrial television has generally been limited to the region above 50 MHz where sufficient information bandwidth is available, and below 1,000 MHz, due to problems associated with increased path loss, as mentioned above.

====Two-way wireless communications====
Two-way communication systems have primarily been limited to lower-information-capacity applications, such as audio, facsimile, or radioteletype. For the most part, higher-capacity systems, such as two-way video communications or terrestrial microwave telephone and data trunks, have been limited and confined to UHF or microwave and to point-point paths.

Higher capacity systems such as third-generation cellular telephone systems require a large infrastructure of more closely spaced cell sites in order to maintain communications within typical environments, where path losses are much greater than in free space and which also require omnidirectional access by the users.

====Satellite communications====
For information delivery to end users, satellite systems, by nature, have relatively long path lengths, even for low earth-orbiting satellites. They are also very expensive to deploy and therefore each satellite must serve many users. Additionally, the very long paths of geostationary satellites cause information latency that makes many real-time applications unfeasible.

As a solution to the last-mile problem, satellite systems have application and sharing limitations. The ICE which they transmit must be spread over a relatively large geographical area. This causes the received signal to be relatively small, unless very large or directional terrestrial antennas are used. A parallel problem exists when a satellite is receiving.

In that case, the satellite system must have a very great information capacity in order to accommodate a multitude of sharing users and each user must have large antenna, with attendant directivity and pointing requirements, in order to obtain even modest information-rate transfer. These requirements render high-information-capacity, bi-directional information systems uneconomical. This is one reason why the Iridium satellite system was not more successful.

====Broadcast versus point-to-point====
For terrestrial and satellite systems, economical, high-capacity, last-mile communications requires point-to-point transmission systems. Except for extremely small geographic areas, broadcast systems are only able to deliver high S/N ratios at low frequencies where there is not sufficient spectrum to support the large information capacity needed by a large number of users. Although complete &quot;flooding&quot; of a region can be accomplished, such systems have the fundamental characteristic that most of the radiated ICE never reaches a user and is wasted.

As information requirements increase, broadcast wireless mesh systems (also sometimes referred to as microcells or nano-cells) which are small enough to provide adequate information distribution to and from a relatively small number of local users require a prohibitively large number of broadcast locations or points of presence along with a large amount of excess capacity to make up for the wasted energy.

===Intermediate system===
Recently a new type of information transport midway between wired and wireless systems has been discovered. Called E-Line, it uses a single central conductor but no outer conductor or shield. The energy is transported in a plane wave which, unlike radio does not diverge, whereas like radio it has no outer guiding structure.

This system exhibits a combination of the attributes of wired and wireless systems and can support high information capacity utilizing existing power lines over a broad range of frequencies from RF through microwave.

===Line aggregation===
Aggregation is a method of bonding multiple lines to achieve a faster, more reliable connection. Some companies believe that ADSL aggregation (or &quot;bonding&quot;) is the solution to the UK&#x27;s last mile problem.

<text>Boite mac Cináeda (&quot;Boite son of Kenneth&quot;; also, &quot;Bodhe&quot;, &quot;Boedhe&quot;, etc.; d. 1058) was a Scottish prince, son of either King Kenneth II of Scotland (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim) or King Kenneth III of Scotland (Cináed mac Duib).

He was the father of Gruoch of Scotland and friend to Findláech of Moray, Macbeth of Scotland&#x27;s father. He arranged the marriage of Macbeth and Gruoch in 1032, which permitted Macbeth to assume the throne of Scotland in 1040. Later, he was behind the short-lived ascension of his grandson, Lulach, to the throne in 1057.

A fictional version of this character appeared in the animated television series Gargoyles.

<text>Wenceslaus III (, , , , ; 6 October 12894 August 1306) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1301 and 1305, and King of Bohemia and Poland from 1305. He was the son of Wenceslaus II, King of Bohemia, who was later also crowned king of Poland, and Judith of Habsburg. Still a child, Wenceslaus was betrothed to Elizabeth, the sole daughter of Andrew III of Hungary. After Andrew III&#x27;s death in early 1301, the majority of the Hungarian lords and prelates elected Wenceslaus king, although Pope Boniface VIII supported another claimant, Charles Robert, a member of the royal house of the Kingdom of Naples.

Wenceslaus was crowned king of Hungary on 27 August 1301. He signed his charters under the name Ladislaus in Hungary. His rule was only nominal because a dozen powerful lords held sway over large territories in the kingdom. His father realized that Wenceslaus&#x27;s position could not be strengthened and took him back from Hungary to Bohemia in August 1304. Wenceslaus succeeded his father in Bohemia and Poland on 21 June 1305. He abandoned his claim to Hungary in favour of Otto III of Bavaria on 9 October.

Wenceslaus granted large parcels of the royal domains to his young friends in Bohemia. A local claimant to the Polish throne, Władysław the Elbow-high, who had started conquering Polish territories during the rule of Wenceslaus&#x27;s father, captured Kraków in early 1306. Wenceslaus decided to invade his rival&#x27;s territories in Poland, but he was murdered before starting his campaign. He was the last of the male Přemyslid rulers of Bohemia.

== Childhood (1289–1301) ==
He was the second son of Wenceslaus II, King of Bohemia and Wenceslaus II&#x27;s wife, Judith of Habsburg. He was born in Prague on 6 October 1289. His elder brother died before his birth and he was the only son of his parents to survive infancy.

Wenceslaus was still a child when his mother, Judith, died on 18 June 1297. He was betrothed to Elizabeth of Hungary on 12 February 1298. She was the only child of Andrew III of Hungary. Andrew III was the last male member of the House of Árpád, the native royal dynasty of Hungary, but the legitimacy of his rule had not been unanimously acknowledged.

Wenceslaus&#x27;s father occupied Greater Poland, Kujavia and other regions of Poland in early 1300. After his main opponent, Władysław the Elbow-high, was forced to leave the kingdom, Wenceslaus II was crowned king of Poland in Gniezno in late September 1300. However, Pope Boniface VIII refused to confirm Wenceslaus II&#x27;s position in Poland.

== King of Hungary and Croatia (1301–1305) ==


Andrew III of Hungary died on 14 January 1301, leaving no male heirs. The late king&#x27;s rival, Charles of Anjou, who was Béla IV of Hungary&#x27;s great-great-grandson, had regarded himself as the lawful king of Hungary for years. On hearing Andrew III&#x27;s death, Charles of Anjou hurried to Esztergom where Gregory Bicskei, Archbishop-elect of Esztergom, crowned him king. Being Pope Boniface VIII&#x27;s candidate for the Hungarian throne, Charles had always been unpopular, because the Hungarian lords feared that they would &quot;lose their freedom by accepting a king appointed by the Church&quot;, according to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;. Charles&#x27;s coronation was not performed with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Székesfehérvár, as it was required by customary law, but with a provisional crown in Esztergom. Accordingly, the Diet of Hungary declared Charles&#x27;s coronation invalid on 13 May 1301.

Jan Muskata, Bishop of Kraków, who was Wenceslaus II of Bohemia&#x27;s advisor, was the first to propose that Wenceslaus II&#x27;s son and namesake should be elected king of Hungary. The younger Wenceslaus was not only Béla IV of Hungary&#x27;s great-great-grandson, but also the fiancé of the late Andrew III of Hungary&#x27;s daughter. Bribed by Wenceslaus II&#x27;s agents, the majority of the Hungarian lords and prelates decided to offer the crown to the young Wenceslaus and sent a delegation to his father to Bohemia. Wenceslaus II met the Hungarian envoys in Hodonín in August and accepted their offer in his eleven-year-old son&#x27;s name. Wenceslaus II accompanied his son to Székesfehérvár where John Hont-Pázmány, Archbishop of Kalocsa, crowned the young Wenceslaus king with the Holy Crown on 27 August. Wenceslaus who assumed the name Ladislaus signed all his charters under that name in Hungary.

After Wenceslaus II returned to Bohemia, Jan Muskata became the young king&#x27;s principal advisor in Hungary. Most lords and prelates accepted the rule of Wenceslaus-Ladislaus. In contrast with their Hungarian peers, the Croatian lords did not acknowledge Wenceslaus-Ladislaus as a lawful king and remained faithful to Charles of Anjou. The latter withdrew to the southern territories of Hungary after Ivan Kőszegi, who was a partisan of Wenceslaus-Ladislaus, captured Esztergom in late August 1301. However, both kings&#x27; authority remained nominal because Hungary had meanwhile disintegrated into a dozen provinces, each headed by a powerful lord, or &quot;oligarch&quot;. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; writes that the Hungarian lords did not &quot;grant a castle, or might and power, or royal authority&quot; either to Wenceslaus-Ladislaus or to Charles of Anjou.

In his letters to Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and Archbishop John of Kalocsa, Pope Boniface VIII emphasized that Wenceslaus-Ladislaus had been crowned without the authorization of the Holy See. The papal legate, Niccolo Boccasini, who came to Hungary in September, started negotiations with the Hungarian prelates to convince them to abandon Wenceslaus-Ladislaus and support Charles of Anjou&#x27;s case. In an attempt to buy the most powerful lords off, Wenceslaus-Ladislaus granted large estates and high offices to them. Matthew Csák received Nyitra and Trencsén Counties, along with the royal castles and the estates attached to them, in February 1302. Ivan Kőszegi was made Palatine of Hungary before 25 April 1302. In the first half of that year, many prelates (including Stephen, the new Archbishop of Kalocsa) abandoned Wenceslaus-Ladislaus; even Jan Muskata left Hungary.

Taking advantage of the weakened position of his rival, Charles of Anjou attempted to capture Buda, the capital of Wenceslaus-Ladislaus, in September 1302. After laying siege to Buda, Charles of Anjou called upon the burghers to extradite Wenceslaus-Ladislaus. The mainly German citizenry and their major, Werner, remained faithful to the young king and Ivan Kőszegi relieved the city in the same month. After Charles of Anjou withdrew from Buda, the papal legate placed the town under interdict. In response, a local priest excommunicated the pope and all Hungarian prelates. On 31 May 1303, Pope Boniface VIII declared Charles of Anjou the lawful king of Hungary, stating that Wenceslaus-Ladislaus&#x27;s election had been invalid. Thereafter Albert I of Germany, who was the maternal uncle of both Wenceslaus-Ladislaus and Charles of Anjou, called on Wenceslaus-Ladislaus to withdraw from Hungary.

To strengthen his son&#x27;s position, Wenceslaus II of Bohemia came to Hungary at the head of a large army in May 1304. He captured Esztergom, but his negotiations with the local lords convinced him that his son&#x27;s position in Hungary had dramatically weakened. Accordingly, he decided to take Wenceslaus-Ladislaus back to Bohemia. Wenceslaus-Ladislaus did not renounce Hungary and made Ivan Kőszegi governor before leaving for Bohemia in August. He even took the Holy Crown of Hungary with himself to Prague. Charles of Anjou and Rudolf III of Austria invaded Moravia in September, but did not defeat Wenceslaus II&#x27;s army. In the same months, a member of the Piast dynasty, Władysław the Elbow-high, who had claimed Poland against Wenceslaus II, returned to Poland at the head of Hungarian troops. Before long, he captured many important forts and towns, including Pełczyska, Wiślica, Sandomierz and Sieradz.

== King of Bohemia and Poland (1305–1306) and death==

Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and Poland died on 21 June 1305. Wenceslaus III succeeded his father in both kingdoms, but his position in Poland was precarious because Władysław the Elbow-high continued his fight for the Polish throne. Wenceslaus realized that he could not preserve his three kingdoms and decided to renounce Hungary. However, instead of acknowledging Charles of Anjou as the lawful king of Hungary, Wenceslaus abandoned his claim to the Hungarian throne in favour of Otto III of Bavaria, who was Béla IV of Hungary&#x27;s grandson. Wenceslaus handed the Holy Crown of Hungary over to Otto in Brno on 9 October 1305. In the same months, Wenceslaus, who had meanwhile broken his engagement to Elizabeth of Hungary, married Viola of Teschen upon the Bohemian lords&#x27; advice.

The sixteen-year-old Wenceslaus led a dissolute life. He was surrounded by a group of young Czech noblemen, to whom he made large land grants. His position in Poland further weakened after Władysław the Elbow-high captured Kraków in early 1306. To forge an alliance against his rival, Wenceslaus granted Gdańsk and Pomorze to Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal and Herman, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel as fiefs in July 1306. After deciding to invade Poland, Wenceslaus dismissed his young favourites and made his brother-in-law, Henry of Carinthia, governor. However, before Wenceslaus could invade, he was stabbed in Olomouc on 4 August 1306. His assassin was never identified. Wenceslaus was the last king of Bohemia from the native Přemyslid dynasty.

<doc id="285728" wikidata="Q10145" url="?curid=285728" title="Milestone">
<text>A milestone is a numbered marker placed on a route such as a road, railway line, canal or boundary. They can indicate the distance to towns, cities, and other places or landmarks like mileage signs; or they can give their position on the route relative to some datum location. On roads they are typically located at the side or in a median or central reservation. They are alternatively known as mile markers (sometimes abbreviated MMs), mileposts or mile posts (sometimes abbreviated MPs). A &quot;kilometric point&quot; is a term used in metricated areas, where distances are commonly measured in kilometres instead of miles. &quot;Distance marker&quot; is a generic unit-agnostic term.

Milestones are installed to provide linear referencing points along the road. This can be used to reassure travellers that the proper path is being followed, and to indicate either distance travelled or the remaining distance to a destination. Such references are also used by maintenance engineers and emergency services to direct them to specific points where their presence is required. This term is sometimes used to denote a location on a road even if no physical sign is present. This is useful for accident reporting and other record keeping (e.g., &quot;an accident occurred at the 13-mile mark&quot; even if the road is only marked with a stone once every 10 miles).

== History ==

=== Roman Empire ===
&quot;Miliarium&quot; () were originally stone obelisks – made from granite, marble, or whatever local stone was available – and later concrete posts. They were widely used by Roman Empire road builders and were an important part of any Roman road network: the distance travelled per day was only a few miles in some cases. Many Roman milestones only record the name of the reigning emperor without giving any placenames or distances. The first Roman milestones appeared on the Appian Way. At the centre of Rome, the &quot;Golden Milestone&quot; was erected to mark the presumed centre of the empire: this milestone has since been lost. The Golden Milestone inspired the Zero Milestone in Washington, D.C., intended as the point from which all road distances in the United States should be reckoned. Odometers were used to measure the Roman milestone spacing, most likely based on Ancient Greek technology.

=== Byzantine Empire ===
A mile-marker monument, the Milion, was erected in the early 4th century AD in Constantinople. It served as the starting point for measurement of distances for all the roads leading to the cities of the Byzantine Empire, and had the same function as the Milliarium Aureum of Ancient Rome. The Milion survived intact until at least the late 15th century. Its fragments were discovered again in the late 1960s. A fragment is re-erected as a pillar.

=== Islamic civilization ===

In Islamic civilisation, use of milestone began in the first Islamic century. The Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik bin Marwan laid the milestones along the paths that travelers used, and some were found in the city of Faiq in the Syrian Golan, which is, Faiq, one of the main road stations throughout the Islamic ages. The function of these stones was to guide travelers and introduce them to long distances, as the separation between one and the other was one mile. Many of these stones were found in more than one location, one in the Islamic Archeology Museum in Istanbul and another in the Jerusalem Museum. A translation of the text written on the stone currently found in the Kasserine Museum in the Golan reads as follows:

=== Post-Medieval Europe ===

In Europe, the distance measured typically starts at specified point within a city or town, as many roads were named for the towns at either end. For example, in London, United Kingdom, a plaque near the Eleanor cross at Charing Cross is the reference point from which distances from London to other towns and cities are measured. In the UK, milestones are especially associated with former turnpike roads.

The British built many milestones on the island of Malta. They consisted of large slabs of local hard rock and they were engraved with the distance to or from a particular location. Many of these were defaced in World War II to disorientate forces in a potential invasion. Despite this, a very small number of milestones still exist undefaced, and one of these is now in the Malta at War Museum.

===India===
The Kos Minars or &quot;Mile Pillars&quot; are medieval milestones that were made by the 16th-century Afghan Ruler Sher Shah Suri and later on by Mughal emperors. These Minars were erected by the Mughal Emperors on the main highways across the empire to mark the distance.
The Kos Minar is a solid round pillar, around in height that stands on a masonry platform built with bricks and plastered over with lime. Though not architecturally very impressive, being milestones, they were an important part of communication and travel in a large empire.

Kos is an ancient Indian unit of distance. It can represent either a distance of approximately or . Minar is a Persian word for tower. Abul Fazl recorded in &quot;Akbar Nama&quot; that in the year 1575 AD, Akbar issued an order that at every Kos on the way from Agra to Ajmer, a pillar or a minar should be erected for the comfort of the travelers.

== Modern highways ==

The historical term &quot;milestone&quot; is still used today, even though the &quot;stones&quot; are typically metal highway location markers and in most countries use kilometres and metres rather than miles and yards. Also found today are more closely spaced signs containing fractional numbers, and signs along railways, beaches and canals.

=== Australia ===

Metrication in Australia caused the former mile markers to be gradually replaced with 10 km markers on highways and country roads, which are referred to as &quot;kilometre plates&quot;.
Kilometre plates have white text on a trapezoidal green background, and are generally located about a metre above the ground. They have a letter which indicates the town or city they are referring to, and a number, which is the distance in kilometres to that town or city.

Kilometre plates are now generally 5 km apart on major highways and 10 or 20 km apart on less popular or rural highways, though there are many exceptions. Kilometre plates are supplemented by signboards, which display distances to several towns ahead.

Some mile markers are retained as curiosities (see gallery). These include stone markers on Victoria&#x27;s Glenelg Highway at Delacombe,

=== Canada ===
Usage varies by province, as highways are under provincial jurisdiction. In Alberta, for example, kilometre markers are green metal signs with white lettering, and are generally placed every 4 km starting at the last major intersection to the south or west, depending on whether the route runs north–south or east–west.

=== India ===

Milestones on National highways of India typically have white backgrounds with yellow tops (on national highways) or green tops (on state highways). The names of cities and distances are painted in black. The names of the nearest towns and cities are written along with distance in kilometres. On undivided highways, both sides of the milestones are used, telling the distance to the nearest cities in each direction. The highway number is written on the head of the milestone. The sum of the distances of two nearest cities in each direction from the milestone is listed on the side.
=== Philippines ===

Milestones in the Philippines are found in highways, one kilometer apart, and are found in pairs, one on each side of the road. These are short yellow concrete posts, with two labels on a white background, written in black. On top is a large &quot;K&quot; (or &quot;KM&quot;), and a number, referencing the distance from the kilometre zero. While the national kilometre zero is in Rizal Park, each major island has its own kilometre zero. The milestones on the Luzon mainland reference Rizal Park&#x27;s kilometre zero.

The second label is a letter, standing for the first letter of the next town if one is traveling on &quot;that&quot; direction, then the distance in kilometers, from the town. In the example to the right, a milestone in Ortigas Avenue in Pasig says it is from Rizal Park, and from Cainta. On the other side, the milestone there says it is 
 from San Juan.

Most milestones only have labels on one side, facing the driver. Others have labels on all four sides.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the UK, driver location signs are placed every along each side of motorways, and along some other major roads. They were first introduced in 2003, and they complement distance marker posts, small roadside posts at intervals, used for road maintenance and administrative purposes. Both types of sign display a unique location number. The number is given without units but is the distance in kilometres from a designated datum location for the road.

=== United States ===
In the U.S. Interstate Highway System, the numbers usually measure the distance to the southern or western state line, or the route&#x27;s terminus, if the national southern or western terminus lies in that state. The numbering system for other highways varies by state; most use a system mirroring that of the Interstate System, other states, such as Illinois, California, and Kentucky, use the county line as the zero mile marker, while others, including Missouri, do not sign mile-markers at all (except on Interstates). Arizona has a rather unusual system, where a route&#x27;s mileposts continue those from its original host. Often, the exits are numbered according to the nearest milepost, known as the mile-log system. From the beginning of the Interstate system until the mid-2000s, most Interstate highways had markers every mile. Since that time, many states have installed more markers every 0.25 mile, every 0.2 mile, or in some metro areas, every 0.1 mile. Some historic and scenic routes – such as along the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia and the Overseas Highway of the Florida Keys – use mileposts to mark points of interest or (in the cases of many businesses along the Overseas Highway) as a portion of their address.

=== Myanmar ===
In Myanmar, furlongs have been used at least until 2010 in conjunction with miles to indicate distances on highway signs, for example on the Yangon-Mandalay Expressway.

=== Zimbabwe ===
Zimbabwean milestones are constructed of cast concrete painted white with the kilometre distance indented and painted black.
There is no distinction between state and national road-sign markings. They were originally sited every 500 metres by the Rhodesian Ministry of Roads and Road Traffic, starting at zero from the largest town or city. In 1980, the Zimbabwean government began placing new markers 1 km apart and damaged or missing half kilometre markers were no longer replaced.

== Railway mileposts ==

The &quot;Railways Clauses Consolidation Act 1845&quot; compels UK railway companies to provide their passengers with a means of determining the distance travelled (fares were set by distance at this time). Section 94 states:

Similar laws were passed in other countries. On the modern railway, these historical markers are still used as infrastructure reference points. At many points, the distances shown on the markers are based upon points no longer on the network – for example, distances measured via a closed line or from a junction which has subsequently been moved. Whole mileposts are usually supplemented by half and quarter posts. Structure signs often include the mileage to a fair degree of precision; in the UK, the chain (equal to ) is the usual accuracy. In the U.S. and Canada, miles are &quot;decimalized&quot;, so that, for example, there may be a &quot;milepost 4.83&quot; to mark a junction, crossing, bridge or tunnel.

In metricated areas, the equivalent is the &quot;kilometric point&quot;.

== Boundaries ==

Surveyors place milestones to mark the boundaries between the jurisdictions separated by borders. A series of such boundary markers exists at one mile (1.6 km) intervals along the borders of the District of Columbia in the United States.

<text>Thalassemias are a group of inherited blood disorders that manifest as the production of reduced hemoglobin. Symptoms depend on the type of thalassemia and can vary from none to severe, including death. Often there is mild to severe anemia (low red blood cells or hemoglobin) as thalassemia can affect the production of red blood cells and also affect how long the red blood cells live. Symptoms include tiredness, pallor, bone problems, an enlarged spleen, jaundice, pulmonary hypertension, and dark urine. Children&#x27;s&#x27; growth and development may be slower than normal. 

Thalassemias are genetic disorders. Alpha thalassemia is caused by deficient production of the alpha globin component of hemoglobin, while beta thalassemia is a deficiency in the beta globin component. The severity of alpha and beta thalassemia depends on how many of the four genes for alpha globin or two genes for beta globin are faulty. Diagnosis is typically by blood tests including a complete blood count, special hemoglobin tests, and genetic tests. Diagnosis may occur before birth through prenatal testing.

Treatment depends on the type and severity. Clinically, thalassemia is classed as Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia (TDT) or non-Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia (NTDT), since this determines the principal treatment options. TDT requires regular blood transfusions, typically every two to five weeks. TDTs include beta-thalassemia major, hemoglobin H disease, and severe HbE/beta-thalassemia. NTDT does not need regular transfusions but may require transfusion in case of an anemia crisis. Complications of transfusion include iron overload with resulting heart or liver disease. Other symptoms of thalassemias include enlargement of the spleen, frequent infections, and osteoporosis.

The Global Burden of Disease Survey found that 1.31 million people worldwide have severe thalassemia while thalassemia trait occurs in 358 million people, causing 11,100 deaths per annum. It is slightly more prevalent in males than females. It is most common among people of Greek, Italian, Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African descent. Those who have minor degrees of thalassemia, in common with those who have sickle-cell trait, have some protection against malaria, explaining why sickle-cell trait and thalassemia are historically more common in regions of the world where the risk of malaria is higher.

== Etymology and synonym ==
The word &quot;thalassemia&quot; () derives from the Greek &quot; thalassa&quot; (θάλασσα), &quot;sea&quot;, and Neo-Latin &quot;&quot; (from the Greek compound stem -&quot;aimia&quot; (-αιμία), from &quot;haima&quot; (αἷμα), &quot;blood&quot;). It was coined because the condition called &quot;Mediterranean anemia&quot; was first described in people of Mediterranean ethnicities. &quot;Mediterranean anemia&quot; was renamed thalassemia major once the genetics were better understood. The word &quot;thalassemia&quot; was first used in 1932.

== Hemoglobin structural biology ==

Normal human hemoglobins are tetrameric proteins composed of two pairs of globin chains, each of which contains one alpha-like (α-like) chain and one beta-like (β-like) chain. Each globin chain is associated with an iron-containing heme molecular component. Throughout life, the synthesis of the alpha-like and the beta-like chains is balanced so that their ratio is relatively constant and there is no excess of either type.

The specific alpha and beta-like chains that are incorporated into hemoglobins are highly regulated during development:
* Embryonic hemoglobins are expressed as early as four to six weeks of embryogenesis and disappear around the eighth week of gestation as they are replaced by fetal hemoglobin.
* Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is produced from approximately eight weeks of gestation through to birth and constitutes approximately 80 percent of hemoglobin in the full-term neonate. It declines during the first few months of life and constitutes &lt;1 percent of total hemoglobin by and past early childhood. HbF is composed of two alpha globins and two gamma globins (α2γ2).
* Adult hemoglobin (HbA) is produced at low levels through embryonic and fetal life and is the predominant hemoglobin in children by six months of age and onward; it constitutes 96-97% of total hemoglobin in individuals without a hemoglobinopathy. It is composed of two alpha globins and two beta globins (α2β2).
* Hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) is a minor adult hemoglobin that normally accounts for approximately 2.5-3.5% of total hemoglobin. It is composed of two alpha globins and two delta globins (α2δ2).

==Symptoms==

Symptoms depend on the type and severity of thalassemia. Carriers of thalassemia genes may have no symptoms (thalassemia minor) or very mild symptoms with occasional crisis (thalassemia intermedia); individuals who are homozygous for the mutation have severe and life threatening symptoms (thalassemia major).

Alpha thalassemia major is generally fatal to the unborn child, as the absence of alpha globin means that zero functional hemoglobin is produced during gestation. Unmatched gamma globin chains cluster to form hemoglobin Bart&#x27;s, which is ineffective at transporting oxygen. In this situation, a fetus will develop hydrops fetalis, a form of edema, which can be detected on prenatal ultrasound. The child will normally die before or shortly after birth, unless intrauterine blood transfusion is performed. Less severe alpha thalassemia may affect growth and development.

Beta thalassemia symptoms typically begin to show during the first six months of life, as the body winds down production of fetal hemoglobin HbF. In a normal individual, this would be replaced by adult hemoglobin HbA.

If thalassemia is untreated or undetected in the infant, this can lead to developmental issues such as slowed growth, delayed puberty, bone abnormalities, and intellectual impairment.

More generally, impaired production of hemoglobin causes anemia, resulting in tiredness and a general lack of energy, shortness of breath, rapid or irregular heartbeat, dizziness, pale skin, yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice).

In thalassemia, ineffective erythropoiesis causes the bone marrow to expand. This expansion is a compensatory response to the damage caused to red blood cells by the imbalanced production of globin chains. Bone marrow expansion can lead to abnormal bone structure, particularly in the skull and face. Expansion of the bone marrow in the developing child leads to a distinctive facial shape often referred to as &quot;Chipmunk facies&quot;. Other skeletal changes include osteoporosis, growth retardation, and malformation of the spine.

People with thalassemia can get too much iron in their bodies, either from the disease itself as RBCs are destroyed, or as a consequence of frequent blood transfusions. Excess iron is not excreted, but forms toxic non-transferrin-bound iron. This can lead to organ damage, potentially affecting the heart, liver, endocrine system, bones and spleen. Symptoms include an irregular heartbeat, cardiomyopathy, cirrhosis of the liver, hypothyroidism, delayed puberty and fertility problems, brittle and deformed bones, and an enlarged spleen.

The spleen is the organ which removes damaged red blood cells from circulation; in thalassemia patients it is abnormally active, causing it to enlarge and possibly become hyperactive, a condition called hypersplenism.

The immune system can become compromised in a number of ways; anemia, iron overload, and hypersplenism may affect the immune response and increase the risk of severe infection.

==Pathophysiology==

&lt;section begin=&quot;Pathophys&quot; /&gt;
Hemoglobin is a protein containing iron that facilitates the transportation of oxygen in red blood cells. Hemoglobin in the blood carries oxygen from the lungs to the other tissues of the body, where it releases the oxygen to enable metabolism. A healthy level of hemoglobin for men is between 13.2 and 16.6 grams per deciliter, and in women between 11.6 and 15 g/d.

Normal adult hemoglobin (HbA) is composed of four protein chains, two α and two β-globin chains arranged into a heterotetramer. In thalassemia, patients have defects in the noncoding region of either the α or β-globin genes, causing ineffective production of normal alpha- or beta-globin chains, which can lead to ineffective erythropoiesis, premature red blood cell destruction, and anemia. The thalassemias are classified according to which chain of the hemoglobin molecule is affected. In α-thalassemias, production of the α-globin chain is affected, while in β-thalassemia, production of the β-globin chain is affected.
&lt;section end=&quot;Pathophys&quot; /&gt;
===Evolutionary advantage===

Having a mild form of alpha thalassemia has been demonstrated to protect against malaria and thus can be an advantage in malaria endemic areas, thus conferring a selective survival advantage on carriers (known as heterozygous advantage), and perpetuating the mutation. There are suggestions that mild beta thalassemia may provide similar protection but this has not been proven.

α thalassemia genes have a high prevalence in populations of sub-Saharan Africa, Mediterranean, Middle East, and southeast and east Asia. β-thalassemias are commonest in the populations of the Mediterranean, Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

The α-globin chains are encoded by two closely linked genes &quot;HBA1&quot; and &quot;HBA2&quot; on chromosome 16; in a person with two copies on each chromosome, a total of four loci encode the α chain. Two alleles are maternal and two alleles are paternal in origin. Alpha-thalassemias result in decreased alpha-globin production, resulting in an excess of β chains in adults and excess γ chains in fetus and newborns. 

* In infants and adults, the excess β chains form unstable tetramers called hemoglobin H or HbH comprising 4 beta chains. 
* In the fetus, the excess γ chains combine hemoglobin Bart&#x27;s comprising 4 gamma chains

Both HbH and Hb Bart&#x27;s have a strong affinity for oxygen but do not release it, causing oxygen starvation in the tissues. They can also precipitate within the RBC damaging its membrane and shortening the life of the cell. 

The severity of the α-thalassemias is correlated with the number of affected α-globin alleles: the greater, the more severe will be the manifestations of the disease. 
&lt;section end=&quot;alphathal&quot; /&gt;
===Beta-thalassemia===

β-globin chains are encoded by the &quot;HBB gene&quot; on chromosome 11; in a healthy person with two copies on each chromosome, two loci encode the β chain. In beta thalassemia, a single faulty gene can be either asymptomatic or cause mild disease; if both genes are faulty this causes moderate to severe disease.

Mutated alleles are called β+ when partial function is conserved and some beta-globin is generated, or βo when no functioning protein is produced.

The situation of both alleles determines the clinical picture:
* β thalassemia major (Mediterranean anemia or Cooley anemia) is caused by a βo/βo genotype. No functional β chains are produced, and thus no hemoglobin A can be assembled. This is the most severe form of β-thalassemia.
* β thalassemia intermedia is caused by a β+/βo or β+/β+ genotype. In this form, some hemoglobin A is produced.
* β thalassemia minor is caused by a β/βo or β/β+ genotype. Only one of the two β globin alleles contains a mutation, so β chain production is not terribly compromised and patients may be relatively asymptomatic.

===Delta-thalassemia===

As well as alpha and beta chains present in hemoglobin, about 3% of adult hemoglobin is made of alpha and delta globin chains. Just as with beta thalassemia, mutations that affect the ability of this gene to produce delta chains can occur.

===Combination hemoglobinopathies===
A combination hemoglobinopathy occurs when someone inherits two different abnormal hemoglobin genes. If these are different versions of the same gene, one having been inherited from each parent it is an example of compound heterozygosity.

Both alpha- and beta- thalassemia can coexist with other hemoglobinopathies. Combinations involving alpha thalassemia are generally benign.

Some examples of clinically significant combinations involving beta thalassemia include:

* Hemoglobin C/ beta thalassemia: common in Mediterranean and African populations generally results in a moderate form of anemia with splenomegaly.
* Hemoglobin D/ beta thalassemia: common in the northwestern parts of India and Pakistan (Punjab region).

* Hemoglobin E/ beta thalassemia: common in Cambodia, Thailand, and parts of India, it is clinically similar to β thalassemia major or β thalassemia intermedia.
* Hemoglobin S/ beta thalassemia: common in African and Mediterranean populations, it is clinically similar to sickle-cell anemia.
* Delta-beta thalassemia is a rare form of thalassemia in which there is a reduced production of both the delta and beta globins. It is generally asymptomatic.
==Diagnosis==

&lt;section begin=&quot;Thal_Diag&quot; /&gt;
=== Prenatal and newborn screening ===
Checking for hemoglobinopathies begins during pregnancy, with a prenatal screening questionnaire which includes, among other things, a consideration of health issues in the child&#x27;s parents and close relatives. During pregnancy, genetic testing can be done on samples taken of fetal blood, of amniotic fluid, or chorionic villus sampling. A routine heel prick test, in which a small sample of blood is collected a few days after birth, can detect some forms of hemoglobinopathy.

=== Diagnostic tests ===
The initial tests for thalassemias are:

* Complete blood count (CBC): Checks the number, size, and maturity of blood cells. Hemoglobin of less than 10 g/dl may indicate a carrier, below 7 g/dl is indicative of thalassemia major. In thalassemia major, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are less than 70 fl, in thalassemia intermedia, MCV levels are below 80 fl (The normal range for MCV is 80–100 fl). The Mentzer index can be a pointer for diagnosis of thalassemia; it can can be calculated from a CBC report.
* Peripheral blood smear: A blood smear examined under a microscope can show red blood cells that are abnormal in shape (poikilocytosis or codocytes), color (hypochromic), or size (microcytic), as well as those with abnormal inclusions (Heinz bodies).
* Serum iron and ferritin: these tests are needed to rule out iron-deficiency anemia.

For an exact diagnosis, the following tests can be performed:

* Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a test that can detect different types of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is extracted from the red cells, then introduced into a porous gel and subjected to an electrical field. This separates the normal and abnormal types of hemoglobin which can then be identified and quantified. Due to reduced production of HbA in beta thalassemia, the proportion of HbA2 and HbF relative to HbA are generally increased above normal. In alpha thalassemia the normal proportion is maintained.
* High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is reliable, fully automated, and able to distinguish most types of abnormal hemoglobin including carriers, The method separates and quantifies hemoglobin fractions by measuring their rate of flow through a column of absorbent material.
* DNA analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or next-generation sequencing. These tests can identify carriers of thalassemia genes and combination hemoglobinopathies, as well as identifying the exact mutation which underlies the disease.
&lt;section end=&quot;Thal_Diag&quot; /&gt;

==Management==
&lt;section begin=&quot;Thal_Management&quot;&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

Treatment for thalassemia depends on the severity of the disease. People with thalassemia traits (thalassemia minor or non transfusion dependent thalassemia), may not require medical or follow-up care after the initial diagnosis is made. Occasionally transfusions may be necessary particularly around childbirth, surgery, or if other conditions provoke anemia. A folic acid supplement may also be recommended.

For those with severe forms of thalassemia (thalassemia major, or transfusion-dependent thalassemia), the three principal treatments are red blood cell transfusions to relieve anemia, iron chelation to mitigate the side effects of transfusion, and folic acid supplementation to encourage the growth of new blood cells. Other forms of treatment available depending on individual circumstances.

=== Red blood cell transfusions ===
Blood transfusions are the main treatment approach for prolonging life. Donated healthy red blood cells have a functional life of 4 to 6 weeks before they wear out and are broken down in the spleen. Regular transfusions every three to four weeks are necessary in order to maintain hemoglobin at a healthy level. Transfusions come with risks including iron overload, the risk of acquiring infections, and the risk of immune reaction to the donated cells (alloimmunization).

=== Iron chelation ===
Multiple blood transfusions lead to severe iron overload, as the body eventually breaks down the hemoglobin in donated cells. This releases iron which it is unable to excrete. Iron overload may be treated by chelation therapy with the medications deferoxamine, deferiprone, or deferasirox. Deferoxamine is only effective as a daily injection, complicating its long-term use. Adverse effects include primary skin reactions around the injection site and hearing loss. Deferasirox and deferiprone are both oral medications, whose common side effects include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

=== Folic acid ===
Folate is a B group vitamin which is involved in the manufacture of red blood cells. Folate supplementation, in the form of folic acid, is often recommended in thalassemia.

=== Other treatments ===

==== Luspatercept ====
Luspatercept is a drug used to treat anemia in adults with β-thalassemia, it can improve the maturation of red blood cells and reduce the need for frequent blood transfusions. It is administered by injection every three weeks. Luspatercept was authorised for use in the US in 2019 and by the European Medicines Agency in 2020.

==== Hydroxyurea ====
Hydroxyurea is another drug that can sometimes be administered to relieve anemia caused by beta-thalassemia. This is achieved, in part, by reactivating fetal haemoglobin production; however its effectiveness is uncertain.

==== Osteoporosis ====
People with thalassemia are at a higher risk of osteoporosis. Treatment options include bisphosphonates and zinc supplementation.

==== Removal of the spleen ====

The spleen is the organ which removes damaged or misshapen red blood cells from the circulation. In thalassemia, this can lead to the spleen becoming enlarged, a condition known as splenomegaly. Slight enlargement of the spleen is not a problem, however if it becomes extreme then surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) may be recommended.

== Transplantation and gene therapy ==
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are cells in the bone marrow that can develop into all types of blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. There are two possible ways to treat hemoglobinopathies by targeting HSCs. One is to transplant HSCs from a healthy donor into the patient&#x27;s bone marrow; this was pioneered in 1981. More recently, it has become possible to use CRISPR gene editing technology to modify the patient&#x27;s own HSCs in a way that increases production of functional beta-globin chains, leading to near normal levels of healthy hemoglobin.

All stem cell treatments must involve myeloablation of the patients&#x27; bone marrow in order to remove HSCs containing the faulty gene. This requires high doses of chemotherapy agents with side effects such as sickness and tiredness. A long hospital stay is necessary after infusion of the replacement HSCs while the cells take up residence in the bone marrow and start to make red blood cells with the stable form of haemoglobin.

=== Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ===
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative treatment for both alpha and beta thalassemia. It involves replacing the dysfunctional stem cells in the bone marrow with healthy cells from a well-matched donor. Cells are ideally sourced from human leukocyte antigen matched relatives; the procedure is more likely to succeed in children rather than adults.

The first HSC transplant for thalassemia was carried out in 1981 on a patient with beta thalassemia major. Since then, a number of patients have received bone marrow transplants from healthy matched donors, although this procedure has a high level of risk.

In 2018 an unborn child with hydrops fetalis, a potentially fatal complication of alpha thalassemia, was successfully transfused with her mother&#x27;s stem cells.

HSCT is a dangerous procedure with many possible complications; it is reserved for patients with life-threatening diseases. Risks associated with HSCT can include graft-versus host disease, failure of the graft, and other toxicity related to the transplant. In one study of 31 people, the procedure was successful for 22 whose hemoglobin levels improved to the normal range, in seven the graft failed and they continued to live with thalassemia, and two died of transplantation-related causes.

===Gene therapy===
Gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies was first trialled in 2014 on a single patient with sickle cell disease (a fault in the beta globin gene), and followed by clinical trials in which a number of patients with either sickle cell or beta thalassemia were successfully treated.

Gene therapies work by first harvesting the patient&#x27;s HSCs, then using CRISPR gene editing to modify their DNA in the laboratory. In parallel with this, the person with thalassemia disease undergoes a myeloablation procedure (a form of chemotherapy) to destroy the remaining HSCs in their bone marrow. The laboratory treated cells are then infused back into the patient where they colonise the bone marrow and eventually commence production of healthy blood cells. There are fewer risks from this procedure than from HSCT, since the transplanted cells are autologous having originated from the patient herself/himself. 

There are two approved forms of gene therapy for beta thalassemia.

Betibeglogene autotemcel, sold under the brand name Zynteglo, is a gene therapy for the treatment for beta thalassemia which adds a healthy beta-globin gene to the HSCs. It was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2022. The procedure involves collecting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the affected person&#x27;s blood. In the laboratory, these HSCs then have a new gene for T87Q-globin (a modified beta-globin) introduced to them using a lentiviral vector. Meanwhile the affected person undergoes myeloablative conditioning, after which the altered HSCs can be infused back, becoming engrafted in the bone marrow where they proliferate. This results in a progressive increase in beta-globin synthesis which improves the balance of alpha and beta globins in all subsequent developing red blood cells. Healthy hemoglobin A is generated resolving the anemia.

Exagamglogene autotemcel, sold under the brand name Casgevy, is a gene therapy for the treatment of transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia which induces increased production of fetal hemoglobin HbF. The treatment was approved in the United Kingdom for the treatment of transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia in November 2023 and in the United States in January 2024. Casgevy works by editing the BCL11A gene, which normally inhibits the production of HbF in adults. The edit has the effect of increasing production of gamma globin, a component of fetal hemoglobin HbF, and thereby resolving the anemia.

==Prevention==
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends all people thinking of becoming pregnant be tested to see if they have thalassemia. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families who carry a thalassemia trait. Understanding the genetic risk, ideally before a family is started, would hopefully allow families to understand more about the condition and make an informed decision that is best for their family.

A screening policy exists in Cyprus to reduce the rate of thalassemia, which, since the program&#x27;s implementation in the 1970s (also including prenatal screening and abortion), has reduced the number of children born with the disease from one of every 158 births to almost zero. Greece also has a screening program to identify people who are carriers.

In Iran as a premarital screening, the man&#x27;s red cell indices are checked first. If he has microcytosis (mean cell hemoglobin &lt; 27 pg or mean red cell volume &lt; 80 fl), the woman is tested. When both are microcytic, their hemoglobin A2 concentrations are measured. If both have a concentration above 3.5% (diagnostic of thalassemia trait) they are referred to the local designated health post for genetic counseling.

Large-scale awareness campaigns are being organized in India both by government and non-government organizations to promote voluntary premarital screening, with marriage between carriers strongly discouraged. 

==Epidemiology==
The beta form of thalassemia is particularly prevalent among Mediterranean peoples, and this geographical association is responsible for its original name. Thalassemias resulted in 25,000 deaths in 2013, down from 36,000 deaths in 1990.

In Europe, the highest concentrations of the disease are found in Greece, coastal regions in Turkey (particularly the Aegean Region such as İzmir, Balıkesir, Aydın, Muğla, and Mediterranean Region such as Antalya, Adana, Mersin), in southern Spain, in parts of Italy, particularly southern Italy. With the exception of the Balearics, the major Mediterranean Islands, such as Sicily, Sardinia, Malta, Corsica, Cyprus, and Crete are heavily affected. Other Mediterranean peoples, as well as those in the vicinity of the Mediterranean, also have high rates of thalassemia, including people from North Africa and West Asia. Far from the Mediterranean, South Asians are also affected, with the world&#x27;s highest concentration of carriers (16–18% of the population) in the Maldives.

The disease is also found in populations living in Africa, the Americas, and in Tharu people in the Terai region of Nepal and India. It is believed to account for much lower rates of malaria illnesses and deaths, accounting for the historic ability of Tharus to survive in areas with heavy malaria infestation while others could not. Thalassemias are particularly associated with people of Mediterranean origin, Arabs (especially Palestinians and people of Palestinian descent), and Asians. The estimated prevalence is 16% in people from Cyprus, 1% in Thailand, and 3–8% in populations from Bangladesh, China, India, Malaysia and Pakistan.

Estimates suggest that approximately 1.5% of the global population (80 – 90 million people) are β-thalassemia carriers. However, exact data on carrier rates in many populations are lacking, particularly in developing areas of the world known or expected to be heavily affected. Because of the prevalence of the disease in countries with little knowledge of thalassemia, access to proper treatment and diagnosis can be difficult. While there are some diagnostic and treatment facilities in developing countries, in most cases these are not provided by government services and are available only to patients who can afford them. In general, poorer populations only have access to limited diagnostic facilities and blood transfusions. In some developing countries, there are virtually no facilities for diagnosis or management of thalassemia.

=== History of thalassemia ===
Rudolf Von Jaksch in 1889 first described “&quot;anaemia leucaemic infantum&quot;” as a form of chronic anemia in children which combined with an enlarged spleen, and abnormal size and shape of the red blood cells. His discovery was subsequently found to comprise a collection of different conditions.

The first definitive identification of a thalassemia was in 1925 by Thomas Benton Cooley, an American pediatrician specialising in hematology and childhood anemias. Cooley noted similarities in symptoms of children in his care having Greek or Italian ancestry; he named it &quot;erythroblastic anemia,&quot; but it became popularly known as &quot;Cooley&#x27;s anemia&quot; (now termed &quot;beta thalassemia major&quot;).

The term &quot;thalassemia&quot; was coined by George Whipple in 1932. The word &quot;thalassemia&quot; comes from the Greek word thalassa, which means &quot;sea&quot;. The suffix &quot;-emia&quot; comes from the Greek word haima, which means &quot;blood&quot;. The term was coined because the condition was strongly associated with people of Mediterranean descent.

In 1948, Italian researchers established that the type of thalassemia which was prevalent in Italy was inherited in a recessive pattern.

<doc id="285734" wikidata="Q1292180" url="?curid=285734" title="Spoke–hub distribution paradigm">
<text>The spoke–hub distribution paradigm (also known as the hub-and-spoke system) is a form of transport topology optimization in which traffic planners organize routes as a series of &quot;spokes&quot; that connect outlying points to a central &quot;hub&quot;. Simple forms of this distribution/connection model contrast with point-to-point transit systems, in which each point has a direct route to every other point, and which modeled the principal method of transporting passengers and freight until the 1970s. Delta Air Lines pioneered the spoke–hub distribution model in 1955, and the concept revolutionized the transportation logistics industry after Federal Express demonstrated its value in the early 1970s. In the late 1970s the telecommunications and information technology sector subsequently adopted this distribution topology, dubbing it the star network network topology.

&quot;Hubbing&quot; involves &quot;the arrangement of a transportation network as a hub-and-spoke model&quot;.

==Commercial aviation==
In 1955, Delta Air Lines pioneered the hub-and-spoke system at its hub in Atlanta, Georgia, in an effort to compete with Eastern Air Lines. In the mid-1970s FedEx adopted the hub-and-spoke model for overnight package delivery. After the airline industry was deregulated in 1978, several other airlines adopted Delta&#x27;s hub-and-spoke paradigm.

Airlines have extended the hub-and-spoke model in various ways. One method is to create additional hubs on a regional basis and to create major routes between them. That reduces the need to travel long distances between nodes near one another. Another method is to use focus cities to implement point-to-point service for high-traffic routes and to bypass the hub entirely.

==Transportation==
The spoke–hub model is applicable to other forms of transportation as well:
*Sea transport in which feeder ships transport shipping containers from different ports to a central container terminal to be loaded onto larger vessels.
*Cargo airlines: most UPS Airlines flights travel through its Worldport at Louisville International Airport, and many FedEx Express parcels are processed at its &quot;SuperHub&quot; at Memphis International Airport.
*Freight rail transport in which cargo is hauled to a central exchange terminal. At the terminal, shipping containers are loaded from one freight car to another, and classification yards (marshalling yards) are used to sort freight cars into trains and divide them according to varying destinations. Intermodal freight is often loaded from one mode to another at central hubs.
*Public transit uses various transport hubs to allow passengers to transfer between different lines or transportation modes. Often those hubs are intermodal linking buses, trams, local trains, subways and so on.

For passenger road transport, the spoke–hub model does not apply because drivers generally take the shortest or fastest route between two points. However, the road network as a whole likewise contains higher order roads like limited access highways and more local roads with most trips starting and ending at the latter but spending most of the distance on the former.

==Industrial distribution==
The hub-and-spoke model has also been used in economic geography theory to classify a particular type of industrial district. Economic geographer Ann Markusen theorized about industrial districts, with a number of key industrial firms and facilities acting as a hub, with associated businesses and suppliers benefiting from their presence and arranged around them like the spokes of a wheel. The chief characteristic of such hub-and-spoke industrial districts is the importance of one or more large companies, usually in one industrial sector, surrounded by smaller, associated businesses. Examples of cities with such districts include Seattle (where Boeing was founded), Silicon Valley (a high tech hub), and Toyota City, with Toyota.

==East Asian relations==

In the context of East Asian geopolitics, Victor Cha says the hub-and-spokes paradigm refers to the network of alliances the United States has built individually with other East Asian countries. The 1951 Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan, the 1953 U.S.–South Korea Status of Forces Agreement and the 1954 Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and the Republic of China (later replaced by the Taiwan Relations Act) are some examples of such bilateral security relationships. The system creates a bilateral security architecture in East Asia that is different from the multilateral security architecture in Europe. The US acts as a &quot;hub&quot;, and Asian countries like South Korea and Japan are its &quot;spokes&quot;. There is a strong connection between the hub and the spoke, but weak or no connections between the spokes themselves.

In April 2014, all ten ASEAN defense chiefs and United States Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel attended the US–ASEAN Defense Forum in Hawaii. The meeting was the first time the US hosted the forum and was part of a US attempt to get the countries to strengthen military ties between themselves.

<doc id="285735" wikidata="Q2297443" url="?curid=285735" title="New Appomattox Court House">
<text>The Appomattox Courthouse is the current courthouse in Appomattox, Virginia built in 1892. It is located in the middle of the state about three miles (5 km) southwest of the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park, once known as Clover Hill—home of the original Old Appomattox Court House. The &quot;new&quot; Appomattox Courthouse is near the Appomattox Station and where the regional county government is located.

Before the Civil War, the railroad bypassed Clover Hill, now known as the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park. As a result the population of Clover Hill, where the Old Appomattox Courthouse once stood, never grew much over 150 while Appomattox town grew to the thousands. When the courthouse at the village of Clover Hill burned for the second time in 1892, it was not rebuilt and a new courthouse was built in West Appomattox. That sealed the fate of the village of Clover Hill. The county seat was formally moved to the town of West Appomattox in 1894 and the word &quot;West&quot; was dropped in time making the name of the town just Appomattox, Virginia.

There is a marker at the site of the &quot;new&quot; Appomattox Court House explaining the difference between the &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; court houses.

Two members of the United States House of Representatives, Henry D. Flood and his half-brother Joel West Flood, are entombed in a mausoleum on the courthouse green.

<doc id="285753" wikidata="Q175833" url="?curid=285753" title="Wenceslaus I of Bohemia">
<text>Wenceslaus I (; c. 1205 – 23 September 1253), called One-Eyed, was King of Bohemia from 1230 to 1253.

Wenceslaus was a son of Ottokar I of Bohemia and his second wife Constance of Hungary.

==Marriage and children==
In 1224, Wenceslaus married Kunigunde of Hohenstaufen, third daughter of Philip of Swabia, King of Germany, and his wife Irene Angelina. Wenceslaus encouraged large numbers of Germans to settle in the villages and towns in Bohemia and Moravia. Stone buildings began to replace wooden ones in Prague as a result of the influence of the new settlers.

Wenceslaus and Kunigunde had five known children:

*Vladislaus III of Moravia (c. 1228 – 3 January 1247)
*Ottokar II of Bohemia (c. 1230 – 26 August 1278)
*Beatrice (c. 1231 – 27 May 1290), who married Otto III of Brandenburg
*Agnes (died 10 August 1268), who married Henry III of Meissen
*A daughter who died young

==Early reign==
On 6 February 1228, Wenceslaus was crowned as co-ruler of the Kingdom of Bohemia with his father. On 15 December 1230, Ottokar died and Wenceslaus succeeded him as the senior King of Bohemia.

His early reign was preoccupied by the threat to Bohemia posed by Frederick II, Duke of Austria. The expansionism of Frederick caused the concern and protestation of several other rulers. In 1236, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II was involved in a war against the Lombard League. The Emperor demanded Wenceslaus and other rulers of the Holy Roman Empire to lend him part of their own troops for his war effort. Wenceslaus led a group of princes who expressed their reluctance to divert any troops from the defense of their own territories, citing fear of invasion from the Duchy of Austria. They requested imperial intervention in the situation.

In June 1236, the Emperor imposed an imperial ban on the Duke of Austria. Troops dispatched against the Duke forced him to flee Vienna for Wiener Neustadt. He would continue to rule a rump state for the following year. The Emperor declared direct imperial rule in both Austria and the Duchy of Styria, also held by the fleeing Duke. Ekbert von Andechs-Meranien, former Bishop of Bamberg was installed as governor in the two Duchies. Ekbert would govern from February to his death on 5 June 1237. Wenceslaus was hardly pleased with this apparent expansion of direct imperial authority close to his borders. Wenceslaus and Duke Frederick formed an alliance against the Emperor. Frederick the Emperor chose to lift the ban in 1237 rather than maintain another open front. Wenceslaus managed to negotiate the expansion of Bohemia north of the Danube, annexing territories offered by Duke Frederick in order of forming and maintaining their alliance.

Wenceslaus and Frederick also found another ally in the person of Otto II, Duke of Bavaria. In June 1239, Wenceslaus and Otto left the Reichstag at Eger, abandoning the service of excommunicated Emperor Frederick II. Despite their intent to elect an anti-king, no such election would take place until 1246. In 1246, Henry Raspe, Landgrave of Thuringia, was elected King of Germany in opposition to Emperor Frederick II and Conrad IV of Germany.

==Mongol invasion==

In 1241 Wenceslaus successfully repelled a raid on Bohemia by forces serving under Batu Khan and Subutai of the Mongol Empire as part of the Mongol invasion of Europe. The Mongols raided the Kingdom of Poland, Silesia and Moravia, led by Baidar, Kadan and Orda Khan with a force of around 20,000 Mongols, causing much destruction.

During the Mongol invasion of Poland, Duke Henry II the Pious of Silesia, Wenceslaus&#x27; brother in law, initially asked his help in fighting off the Mongols. However, as Wenceslaus was coming to his aid in Legnica with a force of 5000 soldiers, impatience forced Henry II to attack the Mongols without Bohemia&#x27;s help which resulted in the devastating Battle of Legnica. Following the Mongol victory, Wenceslaus fell back to protect Bohemia. He gathered reinforcements from Thuringia and Saxony along the way, before taking refuge in Bohemia&#x27;s mountainous countries whose terrain would reduce the mobility of the Mongolian cavalry. When a Mongol vanguard assaulted Kłodzko, the Bohemian cavalry easily defeated them in the mountain passes. After their failure against Wenceslaus&#x27; army, the Mongols led by Baidar and Kadan turned away from Bohemia and Poland and went southward to reunite with Batu and Subutai in Hungary, who had won a pyrrhic victory over the Hungarians at the Battle of Mohi.

When Subutai heard in 1242 that Grand Khan Ögedei had died the previous year, the Mongol army retreated eastward, because Subutai had three princes of the blood in his command and Genghis Khan had made clear that all descendants of the Khagan (Grand Khan) should return to the Mongol capital of Karakorum for the kurultai which would elect the next Khagan. Such was Wenceslaus&#x27; success against the invaders that chroniclers sent messages to Emperor Frederick II of his &quot;victorious defense&quot;.

==Duchy of Austria for Přemyslids==
On 15 June 1246, Frederick II, Duke of Austria, was killed in the Battle of the Leitha River against Béla IV of Hungary. His death ended reign of the Babenberg dynasty in Austria. The matter of his succession would result in years of disputes among various heirs. Wenceslaus&#x27; foreign policy became focused on acquiring Austria for the Přemyslid dynasty. Meanwhile, Emperor Frederick II managed to once again place Austria under direct imperial rule. However imperial governor Otto von Eberstein had to contend with an Austrian rebellion, preventing immediate benefits from the annexation of the Duchy.

The Privilegium Minus, the document which had elevated Austria to a Duchy on 17 September 1156, allowed for the female line of the House of Babenberg to succeed to the throne. Gertrude, Duchess of Austria, niece of the late Frederick II, thus was able to claim the Duchy in her own right. Wenceslaus arranged for her marriage to his eldest son, Vladislaus, Margrave of Moravia. Vladislaus was declared a jure uxoris Duke of Austria and managed to secure the support of part of the Austrian nobility. On 3 January 1247, Vladislaus died suddenly and the initial plan of Wenceslaus was negated. Gertrude continued her claim and proceeded to marry Herman VI, Margrave of Baden.

==The rebellion==
In 1248, Wenceslaus had to deal with a rebellion of the Bohemian nobility, led by his own son Ottokar II. Ottokar had been enticed by discontented nobles to lead the rebellion, during which he received the nickname &quot;the younger King&quot; (mladší král). Wenceslaus managed to defeat the rebels and imprisoned his son. Ottokar II held the title of King of Bohemia from 31 July 1248 to November 1249.

By the end of 1250, both the Emperor and Herman VI were deceased. The latter having never been accepted by the Austrian nobles, Gertrude and their only son Frederick I, Margrave of Baden continued their claim. Wenceslaus led a successful invasion of Austria, completed by 1251. Wenceslaus released Ottokar II and named him Margrave of Moravia. Wenceslaus had Ottokar proclaimed Duke of Austria and acclaimed by the nobility. In order to secure dynastic rights to Austria, Wenceslaus had another female Babenberg proclaimed Duchess and betrothed to his son. Margaret, Duchess of Austria, was a sister of Duke Frederick II and an aunt of Gertrude. She was also the widow of Henry (VII) of Germany, who had died in 1242. However, Margaret was much older than Ottokar. Their marriage took place on 11 February 1252.

Wenceslaus did not enjoy his victory for long. He died on 23 September 1253 and Ottokar II succeeded him.

==Evaluation of the reign of Wenceslas I==
Under the reign of Wenceslas I of Bohemia, the royal court came to cultivate lifestyles typical of contemporary Western Europe, including the culture of jousting and tournaments and the enjoyment of courtly poetry and songs. His government is associated with the establishment of Czech statehood, an increase of Czech political influence in Europe, the rise of Czech nobility, and continued development of urban life, trade and crafts.

Wenceslas, like his father and son, supported the arrival of ethnic Germans into the country. He was also the first to allow privileges to the Jews; however, they were expected to pay considerable sums of money for them.

<doc id="285759" wikidata="Q33540" url="?curid=285759" title="Limit of a function">
<text>Although the function is not defined at zero, as becomes closer and closer to zero, becomes arbitrarily close to 1. In other words, the limit of as approaches zero, equals 1.

In mathematics, the limit of a function is a fundamental concept in calculus and analysis concerning the behavior of that function near a particular input which may or may not be in the domain of the function.

Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function assigns an output to every input . We say that the function has a limit at an input , if gets closer and closer to as moves closer and closer to . More specifically, the output value can be made &quot;arbitrarily&quot; close to if the input to is taken &quot;sufficiently&quot; close to . On the other hand, if some inputs very close to are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, then we say the limit &quot;does not exist&quot;.

The notion of a limit has many applications in modern calculus. In particular, the many definitions of continuity employ the concept of limit: roughly, a function is continuous if all of its limits agree with the values of the function. The concept of limit also appears in the definition of the derivative: in the calculus of one variable, this is the limiting value of the slope of secant lines to the graph of a function.

==History==
Although implicit in the development of calculus of the 17th and 18th centuries, the modern idea of the limit of a function goes back to Bolzano who, in 1817, introduced the basics of the epsilon-delta technique (see (ε, δ)-definition of limit below) to define continuous functions. However, his work was not known during his lifetime.

In his 1821 book , Augustin-Louis Cauchy discussed variable quantities, infinitesimals and limits, and defined continuity of formula_1 by saying that an infinitesimal change in necessarily produces an infinitesimal change in , while Grabiner claims that he used a rigorous epsilon-delta definition in proofs. In 1861, Weierstrass first introduced the epsilon-delta definition of limit in the form it is usually written today. He also introduced the notations formula_2 and formula_3

The modern notation of placing the arrow below the limit symbol is due to Hardy, which is introduced in his book &quot;A Course of Pure Mathematics&quot; in 1908.

==Motivation==
Imagine a person walking on a landscape represented by the graph . Their horizontal position is given by , much like the position given by a map of the land or by a global positioning system. Their altitude is given by the coordinate . Suppose they walk towards a position , as they get closer and closer to this point, they will notice that their altitude approaches a specific value . If asked about the altitude corresponding to , they would reply by saying .

What, then, does it mean to say, their altitude is approaching ? It means that their altitude gets nearer and nearer to —except for a possible small error in accuracy. For example, suppose we set a particular accuracy goal for our traveler: they must get within ten meters of . They report back that indeed, they can get within ten vertical meters of , arguing that as long as they are within fifty horizontal meters of , their altitude is &quot;always&quot; within ten meters of .

The accuracy goal is then changed: can they get within one vertical meter? Yes, supposing that they are able to move within five horizontal meters of , their altitude will always remain within one meter from the target altitude . Summarizing the aforementioned concept we can say that the traveler&#x27;s altitude approaches as their horizontal position approaches , so as to say that for every target accuracy goal, however small it may be, there is some neighbourhood of where all (not just some) altitudes correspond to all the horizontal positions, except maybe the horizontal position itself, in that neighbourhood fulfill that accuracy goal.

The initial informal statement can now be explicated:

In fact, this explicit statement is quite close to the formal definition of the limit of a function, with values in a topological space.

More specifically, to say that

formula_4

is to say that can be made as close to as desired, by making close enough, but not equal, to .

The following definitions, known as -definitions, are the generally accepted definitions for the limit of a function in various contexts.

==Functions of a single variable==
=== -definition of limit ===

Suppose formula_5 is a function defined on the real line, and there are two real numbers and . One would say. The limit of of , as approaches , exists, and it equals and write,

formula_6

or alternatively, say tends to as tends to , and write,

formula_7

if the following property holds: for every real , there exists a real such that for all real , implies . Symbolically,
formula_8

For example, we may say
formula_9
because for every real , we can take , so that for all real , if , then .

A more general definition applies for functions defined on subsets of the real line. Let be a subset of Let formula_10 be a real-valued function. Let be a point such that there exists some open interval containing with formula_11 It is then said that the limit of as approaches is , if:

Or, symbolically:
formula_12

For example, we may say
formula_13
because for every real , we can take , so that for all real , if , then . In this example, contains open intervals around the point 1 (for example, the interval (0, 2)).

Here, note that the value of the limit does not depend on being defined at , nor on the value —if it is defined. For example, let formula_14
formula_15
because for every , we can take , so that for all real , if , then . Note that here is undefined.

In fact, a limit can exist in formula_16 which equals formula_17 where is the interior of , and are the isolated points of the complement of . In our previous example where formula_18 formula_19 formula_20 We see, specifically, this definition of limit allows a limit to exist at 1, but not 0 or 2.

The letters and can be understood as &quot;error&quot; and &quot;distance&quot;. In fact, Cauchy used as an abbreviation for &quot;error&quot; in some of his work, though in his definition of continuity, he used an infinitesimal formula_21 rather than either or (see &quot;Cours d&#x27;Analyse&quot;). In these terms, the error (&quot;ε&quot;) in the measurement of the value at the limit can be made as small as desired, by reducing the distance (&quot;δ&quot;) to the limit point. As discussed below, this definition also works for functions in a more general context. The idea that and represent distances helps suggest these generalizations.

===Existence and one-sided limits===

Alternatively, may approach from above (right) or below (left), in which case the limits may be written as

formula_22

or

formula_23

respectively. If these limits exist at p and are equal there, then this can be referred to as &quot;the&quot; limit of at . If the one-sided limits exist at , but are unequal, then there is no limit at (i.e., the limit at does not exist). If either one-sided limit does not exist at , then the limit at also does not exist.

A formal definition is as follows. The limit of as approaches from above is if:
:For every , there exists a such that whenever , we have .
formula_24

The limit of as approaches from below is if:
:For every , there exists a such that whenever , we have .
formula_25

If the limit does not exist, then the oscillation of at is non-zero.

===More general definition using limit points and subsets===

Limits can also be defined by approaching from subsets of the domain.

In general: Let formula_26 be a real-valued function defined on some formula_27 Let be a limit point of some formula_28—that is, is the limit of some sequence of elements of distinct from . Then we say the limit of , as approaches from values in , is , written
formula_29
if the following holds:

formula_30

Note, can be any subset of , the domain of . And the limit might depend on the selection of . This generalization includes as special cases limits on an interval, as well as left-handed limits of real-valued functions (e.g., by taking to be an open interval of the form ), and right-handed limits (e.g., by taking to be an open interval of the form ). It also extends the notion of one-sided limits to the included endpoints of (half-)closed intervals, so the square root function formula_31 can have limit 0 as approaches 0 from above:
formula_32
since for every , we may take such that for all , if , then .

This definition allows a limit to be defined at limit points of the domain , if a suitable subset which has the same limit point is chosen.

Notably, the previous two-sided definition works on formula_17 which is a subset of the limit points of .

For example, let formula_34 The previous two-sided definition would work at formula_35 but it wouldn&#x27;t work at 0 or 2, which are limit points of .

===Deleted versus non-deleted limits===
The definition of limit given here does not depend on how (or whether) is defined at . Bartle refers to this as a &quot;deleted limit&quot;, because it excludes the value of at . The corresponding non-deleted limit does depend on the value of at , if is in the domain of . Let formula_26 be a real-valued function. The non-deleted limit of , as approaches , is if
formula_37

The definition is the same, except that the neighborhood now includes the point , in contrast to the deleted neighborhood . This makes the definition of a non-deleted limit less general. One of the advantages of working with non-deleted limits is that they allow to state the theorem about limits of compositions without any constraints on the functions (other than the existence of their non-deleted limits).

Bartle notes that although by &quot;limit&quot; some authors do mean this non-deleted limit, deleted limits are the most popular.

===Examples===

====Non-existence of one-sided limit(s)====

The function 
formula_38
has no limit at (the left-hand limit does not exist due to the oscillatory nature of the sine function, and the right-hand limit does not exist due to the asymptotic behaviour of the reciprocal function, see picture), but has a limit at every other -coordinate.

The function 
formula_39
(a.k.a., the Dirichlet function) has no limit at any -coordinate.

====Non-equality of one-sided limits====
The function 
formula_40
has a limit at every non-zero -coordinate (the limit equals 1 for negative and equals 2 for positive ). The limit at does not exist (the left-hand limit equals 1, whereas the right-hand limit equals 2).

====Limits at only one point====
The functions
formula_41
and
formula_42
both have a limit at and it equals 0.

====Limits at countably many points====
The function 
formula_43
has a limit at any -coordinate of the form formula_44 where is any integer.

==Limits involving infinity==

===Limits at infinity===

Let formula_45 be a function defined on formula_27 The limit of as approaches infinity is , denoted

formula_47

means that:

formula_48

Similarly, the limit of as approaches minus infinity is , denoted

formula_49

means that:

formula_50

For example, 
formula_51
because for every , we can take such that for all real , if , then .

Another example is that
formula_52
because for every , we can take such that for all real , if , then .

===Infinite limits===

For a function whose values grow without bound, the function diverges and the usual limit does not exist. However, in this case one may introduce limits with infinite values.

Let formula_53 be a function defined on formula_54 The statement the limit of as approaches is infinity, denoted

formula_55

means that:

formula_56

The statement the limit of as approaches is minus infinity, denoted

formula_57

means that:

formula_58

For example,
formula_59
because for every , we can take formula_60 such that for all real , if , then .

These ideas can be used together to produce definitions for different combinations, such as

formula_61 or formula_62

For example,
formula_63
because for every , we can take such that for all real , if , then .

Limits involving infinity are connected with the concept of asymptotes.

These notions of a limit attempt to provide a metric space interpretation to limits at infinity. In fact, they are consistent with the topological space definition of limit if
*a neighborhood of −∞ is defined to contain an interval for some 
*a neighborhood of ∞ is defined to contain an interval where and
*a neighborhood of is defined in the normal way metric space 
In this case, is a topological space and any function of the form formula_64 with formula_65 is subject to the topological definition of a limit. Note that with this topological definition, it is easy to define infinite limits at finite points, which have not been defined above in the metric sense.

===Alternative notation===
Many authors allow for the projectively extended real line to be used as a way to include infinite values as well as extended real line. With this notation, the extended real line is given as and the projectively extended real line is where a neighborhood of ∞ is a set of the form formula_66 The advantage is that one only needs three definitions for limits (left, right, and central) to cover all the cases.
As presented above, for a completely rigorous account, we would need to consider 15 separate cases for each combination of infinities (five directions: −∞, left, central, right, and +∞; three bounds: −∞, finite, or +∞). There are also noteworthy pitfalls. For example, when working with the extended real line, formula_67 does not possess a central limit (which is normal):

formula_68

In contrast, when working with the projective real line, infinities (much like 0) are unsigned, so, the central limit &quot;does&quot; exist in that context:

formula_69

In fact there are a plethora of conflicting formal systems in use.
In certain applications of numerical differentiation and integration, it is, for example, convenient to have signed zeroes. 
A simple reason has to do with the converse of formula_70 namely, it is convenient for formula_71 to be considered true.
Such zeroes can be seen as an approximation to infinitesimals.

===Limits at infinity for rational functions===

There are three basic rules for evaluating limits at infinity for a rational function formula_72 (where and are polynomials):
*If the degree of is greater than the degree of , then the limit is positive or negative infinity depending on the signs of the leading coefficients;
*If the degree of and are equal, the limit is the leading coefficient of divided by the leading coefficient of ;
*If the degree of is less than the degree of , the limit is 0.

If the limit at infinity exists, it represents a horizontal asymptote at . Polynomials do not have horizontal asymptotes; such asymptotes may however occur with rational functions.

==Functions of more than one variable==

===Ordinary limits===
By noting that represents a distance, the definition of a limit can be extended to functions of more than one variable. In the case of a function formula_73 defined on formula_74 we defined the limit as follows: the limit of as approaches is , written

formula_75

if the following condition holds:
:For every , there exists a such that for all in and in , whenever formula_76 we have ,

or formally:
formula_77

Here formula_78 is the Euclidean distance between and . (This can in fact be replaced by any norm , and be extended to any number of variables.)

For example, we may say
formula_79
because for every , we can take formula_80 such that for all real and real , if formula_81 then .

Similar to the case in single variable, the value of at does not matter in this definition of limit.

For such a multivariable limit to exist, this definition requires the value of approaches along every possible path approaching . In the above example, the function
formula_82
satisfies this condition. This can be seen by considering the polar coordinates 
formula_83
which gives
formula_84
Here is a function of &quot;r&quot; which controls the shape of the path along which is approaching . Since is bounded between [−1, 1], by the sandwich theorem, this limit tends to 0.

In contrast, the function
formula_85
does not have a limit at . Taking the path , we obtain
formula_86
while taking the path , we obtain
formula_87

Since the two values do not agree, does not tend to a single value as approaches .

===Multiple limits===

Although less commonly used, there is another type of limit for a multivariable function, known as the multiple limit. For a two-variable function, this is the double limit. Let formula_73 be defined on formula_74 we say the double limit of as approaches and approaches is , written

formula_90

if the following condition holds:

formula_91

For such a double limit to exist, this definition requires the value of approaches along every possible path approaching , excluding the two lines and . As a result, the multiple limit is a weaker notion than the ordinary limit: if the ordinary limit exists and equals , then the multiple limit exists and also equals . The converse is not true: the existence of the multiple limits does not imply the existence of the ordinary limit. Consider the example
formula_92
where
formula_93
but 
formula_94 does not exist.

If the domain of is restricted to formula_95 then the two definitions of limits coincide.

===Multiple limits at infinity===

The concept of multiple limit can extend to the limit at infinity, in a way similar to that of a single variable function. For formula_96 we say the double limit of as and approaches infinity is , written
formula_97

if the following condition holds:

formula_98

We say the double limit of as and approaches minus infinity is , written
formula_99

if the following condition holds:

formula_100

===Pointwise limits and uniform limits===

Let formula_101 Instead of taking limit as , we may consider taking the limit of just one variable, say, , to obtain a single-variable function of , namely formula_102 In fact, this limiting process can be done in two distinct ways. The first one is called pointwise limit. We say the pointwise limit of as approaches is , denoted
formula_103 or
formula_104

Alternatively, we may say tends to pointwise as approaches , denoted
formula_105 or
formula_106

This limit exists if the following holds:

formula_107

Here, is a function of both and . Each is chosen for a &quot;specific point&quot; of . Hence we say the limit is pointwise in . For example,
formula_108
has a pointwise limit of constant zero function
formula_109
because for every fixed , the limit is clearly 0. This argument fails if is not fixed: if is very close to , the value of the fraction may deviate from 0.

This leads to another definition of limit, namely the uniform limit. We say the uniform limit of on as approaches is , denoted
formula_110 or
formula_111

Alternatively, we may say tends to uniformly on as approaches , denoted
formula_112 or
formula_113

This limit exists if the following holds:

formula_114

Here, is a function of only but not . In other words, &quot;δ&quot; is &quot;uniformly applicable&quot; to all in . Hence we say the limit is uniform in . For example,
formula_115
has a uniform limit of constant zero function
formula_116
because for all real , is bounded between . Hence no matter how behaves, we may use the sandwich theorem to show that the limit is 0.

===Iterated limits===

Let formula_101 We may consider taking the limit of just one variable, say, , to obtain a single-variable function of , namely formula_118 and then take limit in the other variable, namely , to get a number . Symbolically,
formula_119

This limit is known as iterated limit of the multivariable function. The order of taking limits may affect the result, i.e.,

formula_120 in general.

A sufficient condition of equality is given by the Moore-Osgood theorem, which requires the limit formula_121 to be uniform on .

==Functions on metric spaces==
Suppose and are subsets of metric spaces and , respectively, and is defined between and , with , a limit point of and . It is said that the limit of as approaches is and write

formula_122

if the following property holds:
formula_123

Again, note that need not be in the domain of , nor does need to be in the range of , and even if is defined it need not be equal to .

===Euclidean metric===
The limit in Euclidean space is a direct generalization of limits to vector-valued functions. For example, we may consider a function formula_124 such that
formula_125
Then, under the usual Euclidean metric,
formula_126
if the following holds:
formula_127

In this example, the function concerned are finite-dimension vector-valued function. In this case, the limit theorem for vector-valued function states that if the limit of each component exists, then the limit of a vector-valued function equals the vector with each component taken the limit:
formula_128

===Manhattan metric===

One might also want to consider spaces other than Euclidean space. An example would be the Manhattan space. Consider formula_129 such that
formula_130
Then, under the Manhattan metric,
formula_131
if the following holds:
formula_132

Since this is also a finite-dimension vector-valued function, the limit theorem stated above also applies.

===Uniform metric===

Finally, we will discuss the limit in function space, which has infinite dimensions. Consider a function in the function space formula_133 We want to find out as approaches , how will tend to another function , which is in the function space formula_134 The &quot;closeness&quot; in this function space may be measured under the uniform metric. Then, we will say the uniform limit of on as approaches is and write
formula_110 or
formula_136

if the following holds:
formula_137

In fact, one can see that this definition is equivalent to that of the uniform limit of a multivariable function introduced in the previous section.

==Functions on topological spaces==
Suppose and are topological spaces with a Hausdorff space. Let be a limit point of , and . For a function , it is said that the limit of as approaches is , written

formula_138

if the following property holds:

This last part of the definition can also be phrased &quot;there exists an open punctured neighbourhood of such that &quot;.

The domain of does not need to contain . If it does, then the value of at is irrelevant to the definition of the limit. In particular, if the domain of is (or all of ), then the limit of as exists and is equal to if, for all subsets of with limit point , the limit of the restriction of to exists and is equal to . Sometimes this criterion is used to establish the &quot;non-existence&quot; of the two-sided limit of a function on by showing that the one-sided limits either fail to exist or do not agree. Such a view is fundamental in the field of general topology, where limits and continuity at a point are defined in terms of special families of subsets, called filters, or generalized sequences known as nets.

Alternatively, the requirement that be a Hausdorff space can be relaxed to the assumption that be a general topological space, but then the limit of a function may not be unique. In particular, one can no longer talk about &quot;the limit&quot; of a function at a point, but rather &quot;a limit&quot; or &quot;the set of limits&quot; at a point.

A function is continuous at a limit point of and in its domain if and only if is &quot;the&quot; (or, in the general case, &quot;a&quot;) limit of as tends to .

There is another type of limit of a function, namely the sequential limit. Let be a mapping from a topological space into a Hausdorff space , a limit point of and . The sequential limit of as tends to is if

:For every sequence () in that converges to , the sequence converges to .

If is the limit (in the sense above) of as approaches , then it is a sequential limit as well, however the converse need not hold in general. If in addition is metrizable, then is the sequential limit of as approaches if and only if it is the limit (in the sense above) of as approaches .

== Other characterizations ==

=== In terms of sequences ===
For functions on the real line, one way to define the limit of a function is in terms of the limit of sequences. (This definition is usually attributed to Eduard Heine.) In this setting:
formula_139
if, and only if, for all sequences (with not equal to for all ) converging to the sequence converges to . It was shown by Sierpiński in 1916 that proving the equivalence of this definition and the definition above, requires and is equivalent to a weak form of the axiom of choice. Note that defining what it means for a sequence to converge to requires the epsilon, delta method.

Similarly as it was the case of Weierstrass&#x27;s definition, a more general Heine definition applies to functions defined on subsets of the real line. Let be a real-valued function with the domain . Let be the limit of a sequence of elements of Then the limit (in this sense) of is as approaches 
if for every sequence (so that for all , is not equal to ) that converges to , the sequence converges to . This is the same as the definition of a sequential limit in the preceding section obtained by regarding the subset of as a metric space with the induced metric.

===In non-standard calculus===
In non-standard calculus the limit of a function is defined by:
formula_139
if and only if for all formula_141 formula_142 is infinitesimal whenever is infinitesimal. Here formula_143 are the hyperreal numbers and is the natural extension of to the non-standard real numbers. Keisler proved that such a hyperreal definition of limit reduces the quantifier complexity by two quantifiers. On the other hand, Hrbacek writes that for the definitions to be valid for all hyperreal numbers they must implicitly be grounded in the ε-δ method, and claims that, from the pedagogical point of view, the hope that non-standard calculus could be done without ε-δ methods cannot be realized in full. 
Bŀaszczyk et al. detail the usefulness of microcontinuity in developing a transparent definition of uniform continuity, and characterize Hrbacek&#x27;s criticism as a &quot;dubious lament&quot;.

=== In terms of nearness ===
At the 1908 international congress of mathematics F. Riesz introduced an alternate way defining limits and continuity in concept called &quot;nearness&quot;. A point is defined to be near a set formula_144 if for every there is a point so that . In this setting the 
formula_145
if and only if for all formula_146 is near whenever is near .
Here is the set formula_147 This definition can also be extended to metric and topological spaces.

==Relationship to continuity==
The notion of the limit of a function is very closely related to the concept of continuity. A function is said to be continuous at if it is both defined at and its value at equals the limit of as approaches :

formula_148
We have here assumed that is a limit point of the domain of .

==Properties==
If a function is real-valued, then the limit of at is if and only if both the right-handed limit and left-handed limit of at exist and are equal to .

The function is continuous at if and only if the limit of as approaches exists and is equal to . If is a function between metric spaces and , then it is equivalent that transforms every sequence in which converges towards into a sequence in which converges towards .

If is a normed vector space, then the limit operation is linear in the following sense: if the limit of as approaches is and the limit of as approaches is , then the limit of as approaches is . If is a scalar from the base field, then the limit of as approaches is .

If and are real-valued (or complex-valued) functions, then taking the limit of an operation on and (e.g., , , , , ) under certain conditions is compatible with the operation of limits of and . This fact is often called the algebraic limit theorem. The main condition needed to apply the following rules is that the limits on the right-hand sides of the equations exist (in other words, these limits are finite values including 0). Additionally, the identity for division requires that the denominator on the right-hand side is non-zero (division by 0 is not defined), and the identity for exponentiation requires that the base is positive, or zero while the exponent is positive (finite).

formula_149

These rules are also valid for one-sided limits, including when is ∞ or −∞. In each rule above, when one of the limits on the right is ∞ or −∞, the limit on the left may sometimes still be determined by the following rules.

formula_150

(see also Extended real number line).

In other cases the limit on the left may still exist, although the right-hand side, called an &quot;indeterminate form&quot;, does not allow one to determine the result. This depends on the functions and . These indeterminate forms are:

formula_151

See further L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule below and Indeterminate form.

===Limits of compositions of functions===
In general, from knowing that formula_152 and formula_153 it does &quot;not&quot; follow that formula_154 
However, this &quot;chain rule&quot; does hold if one of the following &quot;additional&quot; conditions holds:
* (that is, is continuous at ), or
* does not take the value near (that is, there exists a such that if then ).

As an example of this phenomenon, consider the following function that violates both additional restrictions:

formula_155

Since the value at is a removable discontinuity,
formula_156 for all .
Thus, the naïve chain rule would suggest that the limit of is 0. However, it is the case that
formula_157
and so
formula_158 for all .

===Limits of special interest===
====Rational functions====

For a nonnegative integer and constants formula_159 and formula_160

formula_161

This can be proven by dividing both the numerator and denominator by . If the numerator is a polynomial of higher degree, the limit does not exist. If the denominator is of higher degree, the limit is 0.

====Trigonometric functions====

formula_162

====Exponential functions====

formula_163

====Logarithmic functions====

formula_164

===L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule===

This rule uses derivatives to find limits of indeterminate forms or , and only applies to such cases. Other indeterminate forms may be manipulated into this form. Given two functions and , defined over an open interval containing the desired limit point , then if:
# formula_165 or formula_166 and
# formula_167 and formula_168 are differentiable over formula_169 and
# formula_170 for all formula_171 and
# formula_172 exists,
then:
formula_173

Normally, the first condition is the most important one.

For example:
formula_174

===Summations and integrals===
Specifying an infinite bound on a summation or integral is a common shorthand for specifying a limit.

A short way to write the limit formula_175
is formula_176 An important example of limits of sums such as these are series.

A short way to write the limit formula_177
is formula_178

A short way to write the limit formula_179
is formula_180

<text>As the positive integer formula_1 becomes larger and larger, the value formula_2 becomes arbitrarily close to formula_3. We say that &quot;the limit of the sequence formula_4 equals formula_3.&quot;


In mathematics, the limit of a sequence is the value that the terms of a sequence &quot;tend to&quot;, and is often denoted using the formula_6 symbol (e.g., formula_7). If such a limit exists and is finite, the sequence is called convergent. A sequence that does not converge is said to be divergent. The limit of a sequence is said to be the fundamental notion on which the whole of mathematical analysis ultimately rests.

Limits can be defined in any metric or topological space, but are usually first encountered in the real numbers.

==History==
The Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea is famous for formulating paradoxes that involve limiting processes.

Leucippus, Democritus, Antiphon, Eudoxus, and Archimedes developed the method of exhaustion, which uses an infinite sequence of approximations to determine an area or a volume. Archimedes succeeded in summing what is now called a geometric series.

Grégoire de Saint-Vincent gave the first definition of limit (terminus) of a geometric series in his work &quot;Opus Geometricum&quot; (1647): &quot;The &quot;terminus&quot; of a progression is the end of the series, which none progression can reach, even not if she is continued in infinity, but which she can approach nearer than a given segment.&quot;

Pietro Mengoli anticipated the modern idea of limit of a sequence with his study of quasi-proportions in &quot;Geometriae speciosae elementa&quot; (1659). He used the term &quot;quasi-infinite&quot; for unbounded and &quot;quasi-null&quot; for vanishing.

Newton dealt with series in his works on &quot;Analysis with infinite series&quot; (written in 1669, circulated in manuscript, published in 1711), &quot;Method of fluxions and infinite series&quot; (written in 1671, published in English translation in 1736, Latin original published much later) and &quot;Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum&quot; (written in 1693, published in 1704 as an Appendix to his &quot;Optiks&quot;). In the latter work, Newton considers the binomial expansion of formula_8, which he then linearizes by &quot;taking the limit&quot; as formula_9 tends to formula_10.

In the 18th century, mathematicians such as Euler succeeded in summing some &quot;divergent&quot; series by stopping at the right moment; they did not much care whether a limit existed, as long as it could be calculated. At the end of the century, Lagrange in his &quot;Théorie des fonctions analytiques&quot; (1797) opined that the lack of rigour precluded further development in calculus. Gauss in his study of hypergeometric series (1813) for the first time rigorously investigated the conditions under which a series converged to a limit.

The modern definition of a limit (for any formula_11 there exists an index formula_12 so that ...) was given by Bernard Bolzano (&quot;Der binomische Lehrsatz&quot;, Prague 1816, which was little noticed at the time), and by Karl Weierstrass in the 1870s.

==Real numbers==
In the real numbers, a number formula_13 is the limit of the sequence formula_14, if the numbers in the sequence become closer and closer to formula_13, and not to any other number.

===Examples===

*If formula_16 for constant formula_17, then formula_18.
*If formula_19, then formula_20.
*If formula_19 when formula_22 is even, and formula_23 when formula_22 is odd, then formula_20. (The fact that formula_26 whenever formula_22 is odd is irrelevant.)
*Given any real number, one may easily construct a sequence that converges to that number by taking decimal approximations. For example, the sequence formula_28 converges to formula_29. The decimal representation formula_30 is the &quot;limit&quot; of the previous sequence, defined by formula_31
*Finding the limit of a sequence is not always obvious. Two examples are formula_32 (the limit of which is the number &quot;e&quot;) and the arithmetic–geometric mean. The squeeze theorem is often useful in the establishment of such limits.

===Definition===
We call formula_33 the limit of the sequence formula_14, which is written
:formula_35, or 
:formula_36,

if the following condition holds:
:For each real number formula_37, there exists a natural number formula_38 such that, for every natural number formula_39, we have formula_40.

In other words, for every measure of closeness formula_41, the sequence&#x27;s terms are eventually that close to the limit. The sequence formula_14 is said to converge to or tend to the limit formula_33.

Symbolically, this is:
:formula_44.
If a sequence formula_14 converges to some limit formula_33, then it is convergent and formula_33 is the only limit; otherwise formula_14 is divergent. A sequence that has zero as its limit is sometimes called a null sequence.

=== Illustration ===
===Properties===
Some other important properties of limits of real sequences include the following: 
*When it exists, the limit of a sequence is unique.
*Limits of sequences behave well with respect to the usual arithmetic operations. If formula_49 and formula_50 exists, then
::formula_51
::formula_52
::formula_53
::formula_54 provided formula_55
::formula_56

*For any continuous function formula_57, if formula_58 exists, then formula_59 exists too. In fact, any real-valued function &quot;formula_57&quot; is continuous if and only if it preserves the limits of sequences (though this is not necessarily true when using more general notions of continuity).

*If formula_61 for all formula_22 greater than some formula_38, then formula_64.
*(Squeeze theorem) If formula_65 for all formula_22 greater than some formula_38, and formula_68, then formula_69.
*(Monotone convergence theorem) If formula_70 is bounded and monotonic for all formula_22 greater than some formula_38, then it is convergent.
*A sequence is convergent if and only if every subsequence is convergent.
*If every subsequence of a sequence has its own subsequence which converges to the same point, then the original sequence converges to that point.

These properties are extensively used to prove limits, without the need to directly use the cumbersome formal definition. For example, once it is proven that formula_73, it becomes easy to show—using the properties above—that formula_74 (assuming that formula_75).

===Infinite limits===

A sequence formula_14 is said to tend to infinity, written
:formula_77, or 
:formula_78,
if the following holds:
:For every real number formula_79, there is a natural number formula_38 such that for every natural number formula_39, we have formula_82; that is, the sequence terms are eventually larger than any fixed formula_79.

Symbolically, this is:
:formula_84.

Similarly, we say a sequence tends to minus infinity, written
:formula_85, or
:formula_86,
if the following holds:
:For every real number formula_79, there is a natural number formula_38 such that for every natural number formula_39, we have formula_90; that is, the sequence terms are eventually smaller than any fixed formula_79.

Symbolically, this is:
:formula_92.

If a sequence tends to infinity or minus infinity, then it is divergent. However, a divergent sequence need not tend to plus or minus infinity, and the sequence formula_93 provides one such example.

==Metric spaces==

===Definition===

A point formula_33 of the metric space formula_95 is the limit of the sequence formula_14 if:
:For each real number formula_37, there is a natural number formula_38 such that, for every natural number formula_39, we have formula_100.

Symbolically, this is:
:formula_101.

This coincides with the definition given for real numbers when formula_102 and formula_103.

===Properties===

*When it exists, the limit of a sequence is unique, as distinct points are separated by some positive distance, so for formula_104 less than half this distance, sequence terms cannot be within a distance formula_104 of both points.

*For any continuous function &quot;f&quot;, if formula_106 exists, then formula_107. In fact, a function &quot;f&quot; is continuous if and only if it preserves the limits of sequences.

===Cauchy sequences===


A Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose terms ultimately become arbitrarily close together, after sufficiently many initial terms have been discarded. The notion of a Cauchy sequence is important in the study of sequences in metric spaces, and, in particular, in real analysis. One particularly important result in real analysis is the &quot;Cauchy criterion for convergence of sequences&quot;: a sequence of real numbers is convergent if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence. This remains true in other complete metric spaces.

==Topological spaces==

===Definition===

A point formula_108 of the topological space formula_109 is a &#x27; or &#x27; of the sequence formula_110 if:
:For every neighbourhood formula_111 of formula_33, there exists some formula_113 such that for every formula_39, we have formula_115.

This coincides with the definition given for metric spaces, if formula_95 is a metric space and formula_117 is the topology generated by formula_118.

A limit of a sequence of points formula_110 in a topological space formula_120 is a special case of a limit of a function: the domain is formula_121 in the space formula_122, with the induced topology of the affinely extended real number system, the range is formula_120, and the function argument formula_22 tends to formula_125, which in this space is a limit point of formula_121.

===Properties===

In a Hausdorff space, limits of sequences are unique whenever they exist. This need not be the case in non-Hausdorff spaces; in particular, if two points formula_33 and formula_128 are topologically indistinguishable, then any sequence that converges to formula_33 must converge to formula_128 and vice versa.

==Hyperreal numbers==
The definition of the limit using the hyperreal numbers formalizes the intuition that for a &quot;very large&quot; value of the index, the corresponding term is &quot;very close&quot; to the limit. More precisely, a real sequence formula_14 tends to &quot;L&quot; if for every infinite hypernatural formula_132, the term formula_133 is infinitely close to formula_134 (i.e., the difference formula_135 is infinitesimal). Equivalently, &quot;L&quot; is the standard part of formula_133:
:formula_137.

Thus, the limit can be defined by the formula
:formula_138.
where the limit exists if and only if the righthand side is independent of the choice of an infinite &quot;formula_132&quot;.

==Sequence of more than one index==

Sometimes one may also consider a sequence with more than one index, for example, a double sequence formula_140. This sequence has a limit formula_13 if it becomes closer and closer to formula_13 when both &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; becomes very large.

===Example===

*If formula_143 for constant formula_17, then formula_145.
*If formula_146, then formula_147.
*If formula_148, then the limit does not exist. Depending on the relative &quot;growing speed&quot; of formula_1 and formula_150, this sequence can get closer to any value between formula_10 and formula_3.

===Definition===
We call formula_33 the double limit of the sequence formula_140, written
:formula_155, or 
:formula_156,

if the following condition holds:
:For each real number formula_37, there exists a natural number formula_38 such that, for every pair of natural numbers formula_159, we have formula_160.
In other words, for every measure of closeness formula_41, the sequence&#x27;s terms are eventually that close to the limit. The sequence formula_140 is said to converge to or tend to the limit formula_33.

Symbolically, this is:
:formula_164.

The double limit is different from taking limit in &quot;n&quot; first, and then in &quot;m&quot;. The latter is known as iterated limit. Given that both the double limit and the iterated limit exists, they have the same value. However, it is possible that one of them exist but the other does not.

===Infinite limits===

A sequence formula_165 is said to tend to infinity, written
:formula_166, or 
:formula_167,
if the following holds:
:For every real number formula_79, there is a natural number formula_38 such that for every pair of natural numbers formula_170, we have formula_171; that is, the sequence terms are eventually larger than any fixed formula_79.

Symbolically, this is:
:formula_173.

Similarly, a sequence formula_165 tends to minus infinity, written
:formula_175, or 
:formula_176,
if the following holds:
:For every real number formula_79, there is a natural number formula_38 such that for every pair of natural numbers formula_170, we have formula_180; that is, the sequence terms are eventually smaller than any fixed formula_79.

Symbolically, this is:
:formula_182.

If a sequence tends to infinity or minus infinity, then it is divergent. However, a divergent sequence need not tend to plus or minus infinity, and the sequence formula_183 provides one such example.

===Pointwise limits and uniform limits===

For a double sequence formula_165, we may take limit in one of the indices, say, formula_185, to obtain a single sequence formula_186. In fact, there are two possible meanings when taking this limit. The first one is called pointwise limit, denoted

:formula_187, or
:formula_188,

which means:

:For each real number formula_37 and each fixed natural number formula_190, there exists a natural number formula_191 such that, for every natural number formula_39, we have formula_193.

Symbolically, this is:
:formula_194.

When such a limit exists, we say the sequence formula_140 converges pointwise to formula_186.

The second one is called uniform limit, denoted

:formula_197,
:formula_198,
:formula_199, or
:formula_200,

which means:

:For each real number formula_37, there exists a natural number formula_202 such that, for every natural number formula_190 and for every natural number formula_39, we have formula_193.

Symbolically, this is:
:formula_206.

In this definition, the choice of formula_38 is independent of formula_190. In other words, the choice of formula_38 is &quot;uniformly applicable&quot; to all natural numbers formula_190. Hence, one can easily see that uniform convergence is a stronger property than pointwise convergence: the existence of uniform limit implies the existence and equality of pointwise limit:

:If formula_211 uniformly, then formula_211 pointwise.

When such a limit exists, we say the sequence formula_140 converges uniformly to formula_186.

===Iterated limit===

For a double sequence formula_165, we may take limit in one of the indices, say, formula_185, to obtain a single sequence formula_186, and then take limit in the other index, namely formula_218, to get a number formula_128. Symbolically,
:formula_220.

This limit is known as iterated limit of the double sequence. The order of taking limits may affect the result, i.e.,

:formula_221 in general.

A sufficient condition of equality is given by the Moore-Osgood theorem, which requires the limit formula_222 to be uniform in formula_150.

<doc id="285786" wikidata="Q3846508" url="?curid=285786" title="Reverse migration (birds)">
<text>Reverse migration, also called reverse misorientation, is a phenomenon whereby a bird migrates in the opposite direction to that typical of its species during the spring or autumn.

For example, if a bird breeding in central Asia reverses its normal southeasterly migration, as shown by the orange arrow, it will end up in Western Europe instead of South East Asia. This mechanism may lead to birds such as Pallas&#x27;s leaf warblers turning up thousands of kilometres from where they should be. Keith Vinicombe suggested that birds from east of Lake Baikal in Siberia (circled) could not occur in western Europe because their migration routes were too north–south. Most of these lost young birds perish in unsuitable wintering grounds, but there is some evidence that a few survive, and either re-orient in successive winters, or even return to the same area. Many birds that detour from their regular migration patterns find themselves in adverse wintering circumstances, so a considerable number may not survive. However, there is compelling evidence that a tiny percentage adapt and survive in their unusual wintering locations. In subsequent winters, they may re-orient themselves, eventually making their way back to more favorable environments. Some individuals may even return to the same region in consecutive years, demonstrating migratory birds&#x27; adaptability and tenacity.

== Reverse migration as genetic or learned behaviour ==
Some large birds, such as swans, learn migration routes from their parents. However, in most small species, such as passerines, the route is genetically programmed, and young birds navigate innately to their wintering area. 

As migration is most often genetically programmed before birth, there can be rare variations and defects that change the migration programming. These variations will account for some but not all reverse migration cases. Birds that have changed their migration path, if they survive, may breed with others who also follow this different migration route. Their offspring and subsequent generations may now follow the new, genetically programmed migration route. 

Genetic variations may be triggered by a range of factors, including mutations in the genes responsible for the sensing of environmental cues such as photoperiod (day length) or geomagnetic fields, which birds use for navigation. Other factors, such as changes in habitat availability, food sources, or climate conditions, may also contribute to changes in migration patterns. These genetic and environmental influences can lead to the rare but intriguing phenomenon. 

== Methods of tracking migration ==

=== Tracking radar ===
A single bird can be tracked using a manually operated tracking radar to understand the target&#x27;s position and trajectory and to predict where it will arrive. As the bird flaps its wings, the echo can be recorded and compared to patterns to understand flight patterns and changes in flight patterns. Tracking radar was primarily used to monitor specific individuals during nocturnal migration. Many bird species, particularly songbirds, engage in nocturnal migratory flights, which have historically been difficult to trace. Manual tracking radar allows monitoring and recording of the flight patterns of these birds at night, when they are most active.

This technology has transformed the study of bird migration, providing scientists with a better knowledge of the routes, rest stops, and habits of many bird species on their lengthy treks. It has also enabled the detection of certain movement pathways and patterns that would have gone undiscovered otherwise. Manual monitoring radar data not only enhances our understanding of bird behavior, but it also plays an important role in avian conservation efforts and the protection of critical stopover sites along migration routes.

=== Radio telemetry ===
A miniature transmitter is attached to the subject animal and emits a very high frequency signal (30–300 MHz) that can be picked up by one or more receivers. For studying the movement of birds around Falsterbo bird observatory, a migration hotspot south-west of Sweden, three receivers were used to triangulate and track the birds.

The combination of small transmitters and triangulation via many receivers has transformed the area of avian studies, allowing scientists to unearth minute data about bird behavior, navigation, and habitat utilization. This knowledge, in turn, helps to conserve and safeguard critical bird stopping locations and migratory corridors.

=== Ringing ===
Bird ringers attach a permanent lightweight metal band with an identification number to the bird&#x27;s foot in a way that does not impair movement. This identification number is reported by people who find or catch the bird, providing movement and history information that can indicate how old the bird is and where it has been. Birds are usually caught in mist nets to be measured and banded.

Additionally, bird banding provides critical information about the migration patterns of birds. When a banded bird is encountered in a location far from where it was initially banded, it indicates long-distance movements and migration routes. This data is essential for conservation efforts, as it helps identify stopover locations and key habitats that are crucial for the survival of migratory birds.

== Patterns in reverse migration ==

=== Opposite direction or random directions? ===
Reverse migration is widespread around the world and occurs for many species that migrate both by night and day. This irregular migration direction is most often approximately opposite to what is typical, rather than in a random direction. It occurs not only in species migrating to tropical areas in winter, but also in temperate-zone migrants, short irruptive food migrants, and in both short-distance and long-distance migrants.
However, an article in &quot;British Birds&quot; by James Gilroy and Alexander Lees notes that while misorientation primarily occurs in the approximately opposite direction, it can also occur in random directions. These random directions could be partly the result of genetic variations or abnormalities. Birds that adopt and continue to migrate in this atypical direction have been called pseudo-vagrancy migrators. Some species are more prone to pseudo-vagrancy migration: yellow-breasted bunting, for example, is considered to be less prone to pseudo-vagrancy than, say, yellow-browed warbler.

=== Solitary reverse migration during the night ===
A study carried out in Falsterbo, Sweden, concluded that solitary birds migrating during the night were more likely to reverse migrate west (when east is the regular migratory path), rather than to the north in birds that normally migrate south. By only examining species that migrate solitarily during the night, they eliminated the possibly of group migration, where birds could be influenced by the behaviour of others.

=== Reverse migration due to inadequate fat stores ===

Reverse migration is more likely to occur in individuals with relatively low fat stores. Thrushes migrating southwards were radio-tracked to examine when and why some individuals, during a stopover along the northern coast of Mexico, would not continue south but fly inland northerly. Birds that changed their normal migration were almost all found to be lean and low on fat stores. This may indicate that the normal stopover location had inadequate resources for the birds to build up fat reserves, so leaner birds may have moved inland and northwards in search of more food.

A study of red knots noted that reverse migration of 200 km has been frequently documented over the last 10 years. This study found no significant difference in body mass, fat stores or sex for these reverse migrating birds, but found that they had significantly lower hematocrit (the percentage of red blood cells). It has been observed that birds increase their hematocrit before consuming large amounts of food for fat stores, which could explain why these birds chose to travel 200 km in reverse to access high-quality softshell prey to supply fat and increase their hematocrit before long migrations.

=== Reverse migration to avoid flying over large expanses of water ===
Reverse migration is occasionally observed in Door County, Wisconsin. When broad-winged hawks traveling north reach the tip of the Door Peninsula and the islands beyond, the long stretches of water sometimes unnerve them. Instead of crossing over to the Garden Peninsula, they turn around and fly back down the peninsula.

<text>Antoine Gerard Theodore &quot;Toon&quot; Hermans (17 December 1916 – 22 April 2000) was a noted Dutch comedian, singer and writer.
Hermans was also beloved in Flanders and performed in Belgium, Germany, Austria, with an attempt at a 1968 Broadway show. 

== Biography ==
Toon Hermans was born in Sittard. He began performing in the 1930s, achieving local, regional and, eventually, national fame in the Netherlands as a comedian during the post-war decades. Together with Wim Sonneveld and Wim Kan he was considered one of the &quot;Great Three&quot; of Dutch cabaret during the 1950s and 1960s.

While Sonneveld became known for more serious, more searching kinds of cabaret as well as expansion into other areas of amusement such as musicals, and while Kan focused more and more on purely political satire, Toon Hermans remained true to his one lifetime love: simple home-grown humor, the ability to make people laugh. His humor was of a disarmingly genuine kind. His one-man shows usually consisted of stories he would tell, often based on the life of his youth in a small town in Limburg, with a typical panoply of family members, neighbours, friends (some enemies), cats and dogs, which he presented in an irresistibly hilarious manner; and interspersed with simple, charming, crystal clear songs about life, love, and happiness.

Subsequent generations of Dutch cabaret artists, and the theater critics of the 1970s and 1980s, were not much impressed by Hermans&#x27; unpretentious, politically and socially disengaged entertainment, but his fan base remained very large and his road shows continued to attract very large crowds.

As was the case for other cabaret artists, the transition from theatrical performance to television shows was associated with ups and downs, and some believe that the most deeply felt and enduring appeal of his shows was lost in the latter medium, but he nevertheless achieved significant successes even on television, his one-man show in 1967 supposedly having been watched by 6 million – half the population of the Netherlands at the time.

After the death of his wife and lifelong companion Rita Weijtboer in 1990 it appeared that his career had ended, but in 1992 he surprised friends and foes by starting a new tour with a whole new show, different in nature from any he had done before. While the second half of the program was the same kind of straightforward, nonsensical humor that had always been his hallmark, the first half of the new show entitled &quot;Ik heb je lief&quot; (a deeper statement than &quot;I love you&quot;, not unlike &quot;I love thee&quot;) consisted only of songs, in a mixture of simple jazz and French-style &quot;chanson&quot;, that were tributes to love and, indirectly, to his late wife. To the delight of his fans, he toured with this show for about one year, when one evening in Haarlem he broke down during the program and had to cancel the remainder of the tour. As he himself explained, the sadness over his loss had finally caught up with him. He was nonetheless able to return to the stage a few years later with a new show, and remained active for several more years until his death in 2000.

Many of his shows have been recorded, starting with his one-man show in 1958. There have also been quite a number of publications of collections of poems of his hand. These collections started with simple poems, or rather, rhymes, that were humorous but sometimes contained a more serious note; but later it appeared that Hermans may have tried to create more serious poetry, which was not altogether successful (and perhaps it was not he, but his publishers, who tried to put this spin on things).

Among his many memorable contributions, perhaps none are as widely recognized as the song &quot;Vierentwintig rozen&quot; – &quot;Twenty-four roses&quot;, included in many of his one-man shows over the decades. This song consists of a long listing of completely unrelated but numbered items &quot;three little boys playing football in the alley way – 16 sailboats anchored in the sun-lit bay&quot; and on and on and on (and different ones for each new version of his show); and then ending with &quot;and Twenty-four roses, Twenty-four roses, Twenty-four roses – for you&quot;. It became almost as a ritual when the first notes of this song were played by the orchestra, the audiences would erupt in a loud ovation, and Hermans would once again delight his audience with his signature mixture of humor, genuine feeling, mastery of words, love of the theater, and love of life.

==Graphic career==

Toon Hermans also published several hand-drawn cartoons, the so-called &quot;Clownerietjes&quot;, illustrating his puns and poems. He was also active as a hobby painter.

<text>Radio Afghanistan, also known as Radio Kabul or Voice of Sharia, is the public radio station of Afghanistan, owned by Radio Television Afghanistan. The frequencies are 1107 kHz (AM) and 105.2 MHz (FM) for the Kabul area. The name &quot;Radio Kabul&quot; has been given to many different incarnations of the state-run radio station since the first radio transmitters were installed in Kabul in the 1920s.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1925, a 200 watt Russian transmitter operating at AM 833 kHz was installed in Kabul Palace by King Amanullah Khan. This transmitter was destroyed in the 1929 uprising against the King. The transmitter was replaced in 1931 by the new king Mohammed Nadir Shah, and was upgraded in 1940 when a new 20 kilowatt transmitter was installed in its place, operating at 600 kHz. This is generally considered the official birth of Radio Kabul. Programs were broadcast in Pashto, Dari Persian, Urdu, English and French.

===Peacetime===
As King Mohammed Zahir Shah tried to reinforce his goal of pan-Afghan unity, the station&#x27;s name was changed in 1953 to the &quot;Afghan Broadcasting System&quot;, and again in 1960 to &quot;Radio Afghanistan&quot;. During times of relative peace in the 1960s and 70s, Radio Afghanistan hosted a whole generation of traditional and modern Afghan artists such as Ustad Mohammad Hussain Sarahang, Ustad Farida Mahwash, and Ustad Mohammad Hashem Cheshti. These master musicians were revered not only in Afghanistan but also in India and other countries.

===Afghanistan conflict era===
Throughout the modern history of Afghanistan, the radio has been controlled by (and renamed by) the currently ruling party or organization. The various changes of governments during the 1970s were all announced by the new leaders over the radio station. After the Soviet Union installed a puppet government in 1979, Radio Afghanistan was controlled by the Soviet-backed government and was used to rebroadcast pro-Soviet propaganda directly from the Soviet Union.

During the 1990s civil war, the radio station was damaged several times during the fighting, changing hands as different factions gained control of Kabul. In 1996, when the Taliban gained control of Kabul, the station&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;Voice of Sharia&quot; (; ). As the Taliban consolidated their power throughout the country, the radio station was used to rally Taliban supporters and broadcast new edicts by the ruling mullahs. The Taliban banned music on the new station and ordered the destruction of the radio archives, which contained irreplaceable tapes of Radio Afghanistan music and political programs going back over forty years. The tapes were presumed to have been permanently lost, but in 2002, the BBC reported that, miraculously, the archives survived not only the Taliban but the utter destruction of the Radio Afghanistan building by American bombs during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in November 2001. The tapes were hidden by Mohammad Siddiq or &quot;Mr. Computer&quot;, the person in charge of the archives, from the Taliban who destroyed what they thought were the archives but were instead actually Indian and Iranian music tapes. Siddiq claimed there were 50,000 radio tapes.

After the Taliban were driven from power, Radio Afghanistan resumed its music and political programs. It has been claimed that the first song broadcast by Radio Afghanistan following the fall of the Taliban was the famous patriotic song &quot;Watan&quot; (&quot;Homeland&quot;) by Abdul Wahab Madadi.

In 2021, following the Taliban takeover of Kabul, the &quot;Voice of Sharia&quot; branding was again reinstated, with the station signing in with the aforementioned name on 16 August 2021, the day following the takeover. Music broadcasts were again outlawed, being replaced by religious, patriotic and jihadist chants.

<text>Biman Bangladesh Airlines, commonly known as Biman ( , ), is the national flag carrier of Bangladesh. With its main hub at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka, the airline also operates flights from its secondary hubs at Shah Amanat International Airport in Chittagong and as well as Osmani International Airport in Sylhet. The airline provides international passenger and cargo services to multiple destinations and has air service agreements in 42 countries. The headquarters of the airline, &quot;Balaka Bhaban&quot;, is located in Kurmitola, in the northern part of Dhaka. Annual Hajj flights, transporting tourists, migrants, and non-resident Bangladeshi workers and the activities of its subsidiaries form an integral part of the corporate business of the airline. Bangladesh&#x27;s air transport sector, which is experiencing an 8% annual growth rate thanks to a large number of outbound tourists, domestic tourists, and non-resident Bangladeshi travellers, is very competitive with stiff competition among some private Bangladeshi airlines as well as Biman.

Created in February 1972, Biman enjoyed an internal monopoly in the aviation industry of Bangladesh for 24 years, until 1996. In the decades following its founding, the airline expanded its fleet and destinations but it was adversely affected by corruption and mismanagement. At its peak, Biman operated flights to 29 international destinations, extending from New York City in the west to Tokyo in the east. The airline was wholly owned and managed by the government of Bangladesh until 23 July 2007, when it was transformed into the country&#x27;s largest public limited company by the Caretaker Government of Bangladesh. Since becoming a public limited company in 2007, the airline has reduced staff and begun to modernize its fleet. The airline had signed a deal with Boeing to buy ten new aircraft and options for ten more in 2008. After taking delivery of the new planes, Biman expanded its destinations and increased in-flight amenities, especially onboard Internet, WiFi, mobile telephony and live TV streams.

During his visit to Dhaka in September 2023, French President Emmanuel Macron and then Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced the order of ten Airbus A350 aircraft for Biman. The Airbus order consists of the purchase by Biman Bangladesh Airlines of two A350F cargo aircraft and eight A350 passenger aircraft. The aircraft will be delivered in stages with two passenger A350 aircraft joining the Biman fleet first. Biman Bangladesh Airlines is certified as safe to fly in Europe by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. In addition, Biman has also successfully passed the IATA Operational Safety Audit and since then, the airline has resumed flights to some of its previous destinations in Asia and Europe. In recent times, Biman Bangladesh Airlines has seen a marked improvement in punctuality, as well as in on-time flight performance, under its new management team.

==History==

Biman Bangladesh Airlines was established on 4 January 1972 as Bangladesh&#x27;s national airline under the Bangladesh Biman Ordinance (Presidential Order No. 126). The initiative to launch the flag carrier was taken by 2,500 former employees, including ten Boeing 707 commanders and seven other former pilots of Pakistan International Airlines, who submitted a proposal to the government on 31 December 1971 following the independence of Bangladesh. The airline was initially called &quot;Air Bangladesh&quot; but was soon changed to Biman Bangladesh Airlines, its current name.
On 4 February 1972, Biman started its domestic services, initially linking Dhaka with Chittagong, Jessore and Sylhet, using a single Douglas DC-3 acquired from India. Following the crash of this DC-3 on 10 February 1972, near Dhaka, during a test flight, two Fokker F27s belonging to Indian Airlines and supplied by the Indian government entered the fleet as a replacement. Shortly afterwards, additional capacity was provided with the incorporation of a Douglas DC-6, loaned by the World Council of Churches, which was in turn replaced with another Douglas DC-6, a DC-6B model leased from Troll-Air, to operate the Dhaka-Calcutta route. On 4 March 1972, Biman started its international operations with a weekly flight to London using a Boeing 707 chartered from British Caledonian. The short haul fleet was supplemented by a Fokker F27 from India on 3 March 1972; the aircraft was employed on a daily scheduled flight between Calcutta and Dhaka on 28 April 1972. Three additional Fokker F27s were acquired during March and September of that year. In the first year of operation, Biman operated 1,079 flights carrying just over 380,000 passengers.
Four Fokker F27s joined the fleet in 1973, enabling Biman to double the frequency of the Kolkata flight to a twice daily service. A Boeing 707 was added to the fleet in September and the flight to London became twice-weekly, while a Chittagong–Kolkata flight also began operating. In 1974, operations were extended to Kathmandu (February), Bangkok (November) and Dubai (December). In 1976, Biman sold two of its Fokker F27s and bought another Boeing 707 to extend international services to Abu Dhabi, Karachi and Mumbai. Singapore was added to Biman&#x27;s list of international destinations, when a third Boeing 707 was purchased in February 1977, followed by Jeddah, Doha and Amsterdam the following year, which also saw the purchase of its fourth Boeing 707. In 1977, Biman was converted into a public sector corporation to be governed by a board of directors appointed by the government. The airline broke even for the first time in 1977–78, and made a profit the following year. International destinations expanded to include Kuala Lumpur, Athens, Muscat and Tripoli in 1979, followed by Yangon, Tokyo and Dhahran in 1980. Biman took delivery of its first 85-seater Fokker F28-4000 in 1981. In 1983, three Douglas DC-10s joined the fleet and the airline started to phase out the Boeing 707s. The flight network expanded further to include Baghdad (1983), Paris (1984) and Bahrain (1986). On 5 August 1984, Biman faced its worst accident ever when a Fokker F27 flying in from Chittagong crashed near Dhaka, killing all 49 on board. The long haul fleet was then supplemented by the purchase of two new Airbus A310s in 1996, followed by the addition of two more in 2000, from Singapore Airlines and Air Jamaica, and another in 2003.

==Corporate affairs==
===Key people===
Retired Senior Secretary Mostafa Kamal Uddin replaced former Senior Secretary Sajjadul Hassan, who had completed his term, as the chairman of the airline in January 2023. Additional secretary to the government Shafiul Azim is the chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director (MD). Previously, Kevin John Steele, who served as MD and CEO of Biman from March 2013 to April 2014, was the first foreign national in the airline&#x27;s history to be appointed CEO and MD of Biman. He was chosen from a pool of 42 local and foreign candidates after a competitive selection process. Steele was a British citizen who had many years of experience working in management and administrative positions at British Airways and other airlines around the world. Steele resigned from Biman MD and CEO positions in December 2013 citing health issues. Steele left office on . Kyle Haywood took office as Biman MD and CEO on 5 January 2015. A British national, Haywood was the second foreign national to hold the airline CEO position after Kevin Steele.

===Ownership===
The airline was wholly owned by the Bangladeshi government through the Bangladesh Biman Corporation since its inception. In 1977, Biman was converted into a public sector corporation which afforded Biman limited autonomy, led by a government-appointed board of directors. The authorised share capital was increased to BDT 2 billion in 1987, and Biman was transformed into a public limited company, the largest in Bangladesh, in 2007.

===Privatization===
====1980s====
During the late 1980s, Hossain Mohammad Ershad, President of Bangladesh at the time, served as president of Biman. After an early period of expansion and growth, Biman entered an era of nose-diving profits and slow growth, exacerbated by incompetent and corrupt management, who padded purchases, falsified repair bills, and kept unprofitable routes in operation for political reasons. Research conducted in 1996 found that Biman had 5,253 non-flying personnel, 30 percent more than Singapore Airlines, a carrier who operated a fleet almost ten times the size of Biman&#x27;s. The report described Biman as &quot;poorly managed, overstaffed, under-capitalized, and subject to excessive political interference in its day-to-day management.&quot;

====1990s====
In the 1992–93 fiscal year, accounts under the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism revealed that BDT 22 million in tax was not paid to the government. The audit carried out in 1999, also showed that Biman was owed BDT 2.2 million by travel agents from the proceeds of ticket sales, most likely with the collusion of Biman officials. Additionally, BDT 2.4 million was overpaid as incentive commissions to the sales agents in violation of Biman policies. In 2007, the caretaker government launched an anti-corruption drive. This was shortly followed by the forced retirement of 35 other employees and officials, some of whom were close aides of Shamim Iskander. In , Iskander, younger brother of former premier Khaleda Zia, was sent to jail over charges of concealing information regarding his wealth and not for his connection with Biman.

Faced with growing losses from the late 1990s onwards, the government offered 40 percent of Biman to foreign airlines in 2004, hoping a buyer would take over the management of the carrier. However, the proposal demanded that many decision-making rights remain within the Bangladesh government, and the offer was ignored by outside airlines. A similar initiative in 1998 cost Biman $1.6 million in consultancy fees with no positive results.

====2000s====
In the 2005–06 fiscal year, Biman carried 1.15 million passengers, a growth of 70% over the previous decade. With the rise of private domestic carriers in Bangladesh, however, Biman&#x27;s market share for domestic passengers dropped by 35% over the previous ten years&#x27; average, with only 162,000 passengers travelling with Biman in the domestic sector in the 2005–06 fiscal year. During the same period, Biman reported its biggest annual loss of over US$120 million (BDT 8.3 billion as of 2010), with a US$100 million (BDT 6.9 billion as of 2010) loss reported the following year. Biman also fell behind on millions of dollars in payments to its fuel supplier, the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), with debts that rose to BDT 15.64 billion in late December 2006.

====Public limited company====
In May 2007, the caretaker government approved plans to turn Biman into a public limited company with shareholdings split between seven public sector organisations. As a part of the restructuring, the government put in place a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to reduce the man-equipment ratio (MER) of 367:1 (ratio of manpower to aircraft). The industry average at the time was 200:1, and other Asian airlines operated with MERs of about 150:1. The VRS provided compensation based on length of service, at a cost to the government of over BDT 2.97 billion borrowed from the World Bank. Biman management expected to reduce its workforce by 1,600, but 2,162 applications were received, many from employees who expected to be dismissed with little or no severance pay if the quota was not met. Biman accepted between 1,863 and 1877 applications, and affirmed that key personnel would not be allowed to leave the organisation via VRS.

On 23 July 2007, Biman Bangladesh Airlines became the largest public limited company in Bangladesh. Earlier suggestions that the airline should be renamed Bangladesh Airlines were rejected. The government is the sole shareholder of the 1.5 billion shares, but intends to offer 49 percent to the private sector while retaining majority ownership. The previous managing director, Dr. Abdul Momen, was appointed as the chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director of the new organisation. The six directors were appointed from the ministries of energy, commerce, finance, civil aviation, foreign affairs, and the cabinet division, with the cabinet secretary taking on the role as chairman of the board of directors. The six secretaries and a joint secretary to the civil aviation ministry were made the seven shareholders of the new PLC. In September 2008, the government appointed Air Commodore Zahed Kuddus (retd) to replace Dr. Momen as CEO. From 2002 to 2005 Kuddus had been chair of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB), before which he had held various posts in the Bangladesh Air Force.

Following the privatisation, an initiative was launched by ex-Biman employees, who left the organisation via the VRS, to set up a competing airline. Names proposed for the airline included Air Bangla International, Biman Employees Airlines and Balaka. They were joined by previous managing directors of Biman, along with the former president of the Bangladesh Airline Pilots&#x27; Association. However, nothing further was heard of regarding the proposed venture.

The airline made profits in FY 2007–08 (BDT 60 million) and FY 2008–09 (BDT 150 million); In FY 2009–10, however, the carrier incurred in a net loss of BDT 800 million.

====2010s====
In FY 2010–11 it made losses of BDT 2 billion, despite the government exempting it a debt of about BDT 11.94 billion and BDT 5.73 billion owed to the BPC and the CAAB, respectively. In FY 2011–12 it made a loss of BDT 6.06 billion ( million); in FY 2012–13 unaudited figures show a loss of BDT 2 billion. , Biman owed BDT 15.60 billion to different sources; of which BDT 3676.2 million to CAAB and BDT 8.50 billion to Padma Oil Company, its fuel supplier. Biman made three consecutive profits of BDT3.24 billion, BDT2.76 billion and BDT1.51 billion for FYs 2014–15, 2015–16 and 2016–17, respectively. The net profit for FY 2016–17 was BDT470 million. In the FY 2017–18 Biman had an operating income of but having an expense of , it incurred a loss of . But in the FY 2018–19 its operating income and expenses both decreased to and respectively and Biman earned a net profit of 

===Subsidiaries===

Biman&#x27;s subsidiaries are associated with aircraft ground handling, aviation engineering, aviation training and flight catering. There are five wholly owned subsidiaries, including:

Since 1972, BGH provides ground-handling services for all airports in Bangladesh; the company reported a profit of BDT 4.5 billion for the FY 2011–12. The wholly owned subsidiary BFCC was set up in 1989 to provide in-flight meals. It is one of Biman&#x27;s profitable operations, supplying food to Saudia, Etihad, Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways, Emirates, China Southern Airlines and Regent Airways, along with casual orders from other airlines operating into Bangladesh. The BFCC consumes 90% of the eggs and chickens from the BPC, another profit-making subsidiary of Biman formed in 1976 and put into operation in November 1980 to rear poultry at farms in Dhaka. Bird flu was detected at one of the farms in March 2007, and many of the birds were culled. This was the first incident of bird flu in Bangladesh.

==Services==
In 2013, Biman signed agreements with SITA and Mercator to provide infrastructure support and revenue accounting services to the airline. In 2014, Biman launched an advanced seat reservation system on its website. The airline also offers an online meal selection option, where the passenger can choose from diabetic meals, vegetarian meals, Asian vegetarian meals, child meals and Muslim meals, that will be served on board. In collaboration with a third-party service provider, Biman allows passengers to request Business Class upgrades as well as adjacent extra seats after booking an economy class fare.

===Flight classes===

A two-class service (J and Y) is operated on most of Biman&#x27;s aircraft. The Business Class cabin on its Boeing 777 is arranged in a 2–3–2 configuration, while economy class cabin is set up in a 3–3–3 configuration. The narrow-body Boeing 737-800s&#x27; Business Class is set up in a 2–2 configuration while Economy Class is in a 3–3 arrangement. Business Class passengers of Biman Bangladesh Airlines have exclusive access to airport and hotel lounges around the globe.

===In-flight amenities===
Biman relaunched its inflight magazine and re-branded as &quot;Bihanga&quot; in September 2013. The bi-monthly magazine, previously known as &quot;Diganta&quot;, and before that &quot;Jatri&quot;, is published by Subcontinental Media Group. The magazine is available in both Bengali and English, covering topics about Bangladesh and Biman&#x27;s destinations. English and Bengali language newspapers are also available in Business Class on board the aircraft. Biman launched in-flight duty-free sales in March 2014, branded as Biman Boutique. Duty-free products include perfumes, cosmetics, jewellery, watches, children&#x27;s gifts, chocolates, tobacco, etc. In 2014, Biman launched amenity kits for children on-board which include colouring books, stationery, dolls and jigsaw puzzle. Biman doesn&#x27;t usually serve alcoholic beverages on its flights in economy class, however, Business Class passengers have exclusive access to lounges around the globe.

The newer Boeing 777s and 787s are equipped with modern in-flight entertainment systems. Every seat is fitted with personal touch screen displays which are loaded with movies, songs and games. It also has high-resolution moving maps and live flight information. All this is available in two languages – English and Bengali.

Starting with the newly delivered Boeing 787 Dreamliners, Biman Bangladesh Airlines launched onboard Internet, WiFi, mobile telephony, movie streaming and live TV streaming services in September 2018 in most of the new planes in its fleet. Twenty-five satellites were deployed for this purpose. New Panasonic eX3 seat-back monitors with touch screens from Panasonic Avionics offer passengers more than one hundred on-demand movies, music and video games. Onboard touch screen 3D route-maps, the latest addition to the aviation industry, show the various structures of the territories the aircraft flies over. Since March 2017, Biman started to offer exciting new and diverse meal and beverage options in its flights, including diabetic and children&#x27;s meal packages, which is reviewed and updated every three months. All meals served on-board Biman flights are Halal and in Business Class, à la carte menus are offered.

===Frequent-flyer program===
Biman launched a frequent-flyer program, named Biman Loyalty Club, in November 2013. It offers rewards such as tiered benefits, mileage bonuses, extra baggage, lounge access and priority check-in at airports. As of July 2014, the frequent-flyer program had 8,000 members.

===Ticketing===
An agreement was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman&#x27;s ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution to comply with IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing allowed Biman to reduce costs while eliminating the stress of lost tickets for passengers. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court. In 2013, Biman signed an agreement with German e-ticketing company Hahn Air, enabling Biman&#x27;s tickets to be purchased from anywhere around the world.

===Biman Cargo===
Biman also operates a cargo service using the cargo holds of its passenger aircraft to ship freight to international destinations. It has established a Cargo Village at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka where the cargo is packaged and labelled before being loaded onto its aircraft for shipment overseas. The air cargo industry in Bangladesh grew by 16.5% in the fiscal year 2003–04. Private operators increased their share of the cargo market by 10.6% and were responsible for handling 24% of the total 99,000 tonnes of cargo at the expense of both Biman and foreign airlines which saw a reduction in their shares by 4.6% and 6.0% respectively. Foreign airlines handled 47% of the total cargo with Biman taking on the remaining 29% in the fiscal year 2003–04.

In March 2018, Biman Bangladesh Airlines received ACC3 and RA-3 (Regulatory Agent for third country) certifications from the European Union allowing direct cargo flights to all destinations in Europe. ACC3 stands for Air Cargo or Mail Carrier operating into Europe from a third-country airport. These certifications were successfully obtained after the government of Bangladesh upgraded Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport (HSIA) and improved its security, including setting up Explosive Detection Systems (EDS), Explosive Detection Dogs (EDD) and Explosive Trace Detection (EDT) machines. Due to the improved security standards, Biman Cargo Village and Dhaka Airport (HSIA) also got the ACC3 and RA-3 certifications simultaneously and an RA-3-compliant warehouse was built at HSIA for Europe-bound cargo freight where entry is restricted for everyone apart from accredited Biman staff.

===Biman Bangladesh Mobile App===
On 28 December 2019, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina launched the &quot;Biman Bangladesh Airlines&quot; Mobile App. She also laid the foundation stone of the third terminal of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka and inaugurated the &quot;Sonar Tari&quot; and &quot;Achin Pakhi&quot;, which are two new purchases of Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft to the flag carrier. The app was made available for passengers around the world.

==Destinations==

 Biman serves 30 destinations with 48 routes. The airline operates flights to several destinations in the Middle East, some in South and South East Asia and London and Manchester in Europe. The carrier has air service agreements with 43 countries leaving room for further expansion in future.

===New York City===
From 1993 to 2006, Biman operated flights to New York City from Dhaka, catering to the many Bangladeshis who lived and studied in the United States. New York was Biman&#x27;s farthest and most prestigious destination, and was kept operational, despite heavy financial losses towards the end, to maintain a landing slot in the US which, if cancelled, could be difficult to regain.

In December 1993, the airline inaugurated service to New York City via Delhi, Dubai and Amsterdam using a McDonnell Douglas DC-10. It subsequently routed the flight from Dhaka to New York through Dubai and Brussels and the inbound one through Brussels. To curb the losses, Biman reduced the service to one flight per week and changed the European stop to Manchester Airport, UK, capitalising on travel demands from the expatriate Bangladeshi community in the north of England. On 8 April 2006, Biman&#x27;s inaugural flight to Manchester landed at Manchester Airport en route to New York. However, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had placed the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) into Category 2 (does not meet International Civil Aviation Organization standards) according to its International Aviation Safety Assessment Program, which placed additional restrictions on the country&#x27;s airlines when flying to the US. For Biman, this meant it could continue flying to the US, but could not expand or alter its routes. The FAA fined Biman for breaching its rules, and flights to New York began stopping in Brussels again.

The FAA already warned Biman to replace its ageing DC-10s by December 2005. According to experts, these aircraft were inadequately equipped to cross the Atlantic safely. On 13 May 2006, the FAA refused permission for the flight to enter its airspace, citing safety concerns over the DC-10. The pilots diverted to Montreal, Canada, where the passengers were provided with alternative airline options to complete their journey. Canadian authorities inspected the aircraft and gave it a clean bill of health after which the aircraft returned to Dhaka without any passengers. The FAA eventually admitted it was mistaken and apologised for the error. The incident put an end to the route, which had been losing per flight, owing to its use of obsolete DC-10s. Biman decided to axe the route along with several other regional and domestic routes to curb the huge losses being incurred by the airline each month.

===London===
On 4 March 1972, Biman started its first international operations with a weekly flight to London using a Boeing 707. , Biman Bangladesh Airlines flies directly to London Heathrow, from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka, four times a week transporting both passengers and cargo, using its newly purchased Boeing 777 aircraft. Under its new management, the airline has seen a marked improvement in punctuality as well as in on-time flight performance in recent times. Back in 2007, Biman faced strong criticism from major international airports including London Heathrow Airport and Dubai International Airport for its failure to maintain flight schedules. Heathrow Airport operator BAA wrote to Biman providing evidence which showed Biman had not achieved the minimum 80% usage of its allocated landing slots at Heathrow, as required by EU and International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations, during the summer of 2007. Biman should, therefore, not expect slot allocations at Heathrow for the summer of 2008 and should look to Stansted or Gatwick airports if it wished to continue serving London. Following discussions with BAA, however, Biman obtained landing slots for the summer of 2008 on condition that it achieved 80% usage. Delays continued unabated and in September 2008, Biman&#x27;s Dhaka–London direct flight utilising a DC-10 aircraft was diverted and landed at Gatwick when it did not have sufficient fuel to remain in a holding pattern over Heathrow following arrival over three hours after the scheduled time. In 2008, the United Nations advised its staff not to fly with Biman, citing both safety and security concerns and Biman&#x27;s unreliable flight schedules. It was made clear that UN staff who flew with Biman did so at their own risk, and would be ineligible to make claims on insurance. Biman&#x27;s then-newly appointed managing director said he was unaware of the UN directive, but admitted that Biman did face problems in managing its flight schedules. He expected the situation to improve with the procurement of aircraft in the coming months.

===Toronto===
In July 2020, Biman announced the introduction of a new route to Toronto which will be flown thrice-weekly beginning in October 2020. The route comes as part of an air agreement between Bangladesh and Canada, and will allow passengers to connect onward to cities across North America with its Air Canada hub at Toronto&#x27;s Pearson Airport.
On 26 March 2022, on the occasion of 51st Independence Day of Bangladesh and to observe the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Biman operated a special flight, BG-305, from Dhaka and Toronto–Pearson. In April 2022, initially the inaugural commercial flight was scheduled on 11 June 2022, however, Biman decided not to operate a direct flight to Toronto as it would not be commercially viable, rather planned to operate the flight with a stopover in any of the European or Asian destinations for refueling and extra passengers. On 22 April, Biman confirmed that it would use Manchester Airport as a stopover for its Toronto flight, to make it more commercially viable. However, later in May, Biman decided that Istanbul Airport will be used for refueling purposes, making it a technical halt only, not being allowed to aboard or deboard passengers from the airport. On 27 July, the first flight left Dhaka at 03:30 with 160 passengers only.

===Hajj flights===
The annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca for the Hajj is undertaken by thousands of Bangladesh&#x27;s predominantly Muslim population. Biman has been the sole Bangladeshi airline permitted by the government to provide flights for pilgrims to King Abdulaziz International Airport, Jeddah. Every year, the commencement of these flights is inaugurated by high-ranking government officials, including, at times, the Prime Minister. In 2002, the government opened the service to private tour operators for the first time. The initial private flights were plagued with delays, with both outgoing and return flights postponed for as long as nine days. Biman&#x27;s handling of Hajj flights has also been beset with troubles. In 2005, the State Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism resigned after complaints that he set fares too high. In 2006, Biman took the unprecedented step of removing the business–class seats from its dedicated Hajj flights to accommodate more economy-class passengers. Procedural irregularities by the Hajj agencies delayed the confirmation of pilgrims&#x27; visas, and Biman had to cancel 19 flights owing to lack of sufficient passengers. Once the situation was resolved, Biman was then unable to offer the required number of flights to cope with the backlog of passengers.

In June 2007, the caretaker government approved a three-year Hajj policy aiming to alleviate the problems encountered during the previous two years. Hajj flights would also begin leaving from Bangladesh&#x27;s two other international airports, Shah Amanat International Airport and Osmani International Airport. Biman put out a tender for the wet lease of two aircraft for additional Hajj flights and reached an agreement with Phuket Air. However, the deal fell through in August 2007 after Phuket Air demanded advance payment of 30% instead of the previously agreed-to 10%. Ausban Aeronautical Services of Australia was selected next, following a re-tender, to fill the gap left by Phuket Air. In 2008, Biman wet-leased a 542-seater Boeing 747-200 from Kabo Air of Nigeria for six months to operate flights to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Another 512-seater Boeing 747-300 was leased from Orient Thai Airlines. , Biman still experienced difficulties in providing their scheduled services, as the carrier gave priority to the transportation of pilgrims to Jeddah during the Hajj season using aircraft that otherwise were flown on its regular flights. Despite this, the airline reported a profit of almost BDT 1 billion from the 2012 Hajj season, the highest results ever since these services were started in 1973.

===Fleet history===
====1972–2000====
A vintage Douglas Dakota and Douglas DC-3 were the first aircraft in Biman&#x27;s fleet. Domestic operations commenced with the acquisition of four Fokker F27 aircraft flying passengers to Chittagong and Sylhet from its base in Dhaka. Shortly afterwards, a Boeing 707, chartered from British Caledonian, joined the airline&#x27;s fleet, allowing Biman to begin international flights. In 1983, Biman purchased three McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft from Singapore Airlines to provide services on its long-haul routes. In a deal worth , three British Aerospace ATPs were ordered in late 1989. These ATPs entered the fleet in late 1990, coming to replace the Fokker F27s.

During the mid-1990s, Biman switched its airliner of choice for long-haul routes to the Airbus series of aircraft. In 1995, two PW4000-powered Airbus A310-300s were ordered; the first of them joined the fleet on 15 June 1996. It nevertheless retained its elderly DC–10 fleet. For over three decades, the DC–10–30s were Biman&#x27;s sole widebody aircraft and served the airline consistently well, with no noteworthy mechanical problems – in marked contrast to the record of its domestic operations. These were operated with Fokker F28 and BAe ATPs which were routinely out of service because of technical trouble. In one incident, a government minister disembarked a flight and travelled by road when he learned that the aircraft he was on was a BAe ATP. In January 2003, Biman leased two Boeing 737-300s which were used on domestic and regional routes for eighteen months.

McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and Airbus A310-300s made up most of Biman&#x27;s international fleet, before the delivery of the modern Boeing 777-300ERs started in 2011. Fokker F28s made up the remainder of the fleet for the domestic and regional sectors, before they were retired in 2012. Biman&#x27;s fleet contains the second-to-last Douglas DC–10 to come off the production line (l/n 445), and only three other Airbus A310–300s were produced following Biman&#x27;s purchase of two new Airbus A310s in 1996. The two Fokker F28–4000s were acquired from PBair in 2004 at a cost of $2.91 million. Both of these aircraft were built in 1977, making Biman&#x27;s latest acquisitions the oldest aircraft in its fleet. The ageing fleet made it difficult for Biman to maintain its flight schedule, as the aircraft suffered from mechanical problems, leading to flight delays and cancellations. A number of aircraft remained grounded owing to lack of spare parts as they are no longer manufactured and used parts are difficult to source.
A deal was signed in January 2012 a three-year contract with a German company for the maintenance of their powerplants, for the DC–10s. The airline operates its own ancillary and maintenance facilities at Shahjalal International Airport, where it carries out all maintenance work and C-Checks on DC–10–30s and A310–300s.

====2000s====
In 2000, Biman put out a request for proposal for the acquisition of four wide-bodied aircraft to replace the DC–10s, but both the fleet renewal plans and the airline&#x27;s expected privatisation were shelved by the government. A further attempt was made in 2005 to acquire new aircraft and plans were submitted for the purchase of ten new wide-bodied Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a total cost of $1 billion. Boeing arranged to finance the purchase provided a guarantee was given by the Bangladesh government. After bureaucratic delays and a perceived lack of commitment from the government, Boeing lost interest and the plans were cancelled. A similar attempt to purchase medium-haul aircraft for domestic service was also postponed. In March 2007, Biman put out a tender for the dry lease of two Airbus A310-300 and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft for two years. The sole response to the tender came from Star Aviation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

After Biman became a public limited company, renewed attempts were made to procure new-generation aircraft to replace its ageing fleet. In November 2007, Boeing made an offer to supply Biman with four Boeing 777-200s (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2013 and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2017 and provide similar aircraft on lease for the interim period beginning in 2009. The average price of these aircraft was quoted as  million. Airbus also made an offer to supply four Airbus A320 or Airbus A330 series aircraft at a much lower price than that of Boeing. To manage the fleet in the short run, Biman again floated a tender in January 2008 to purchase or dry lease with options to purchase two used Airbus A310-300 aircraft.

On 10 March 2008, the Biman management unveiled a plan to procure eight next-generation wide-bodied aircraft from Boeing Commercial Airplanes for a total cost of  billion, including four 419-seater Boeing 777-300ER (average price of  million per unit), and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners that will seat 294 ( million per unit), to be delivered in 2017. The deal for the acquisition of these eight aircraft was signed with Boeing in April 2008, and also included a memorandum of understanding for the purchase of two Boeing 737-800s to be delivered in 2015, with Biman making an initial instalment of  million. Of the remaining cost, US-based EXIM bank will finance 85%, while a syndication of local banks will finance the balance. In the same year, Biman placed a firm order for two Boeing 737-800s, and took options for two more aircraft of the type. The total order for these ten aircraft was valued at around  billion.

====2010s====

In 2010, Biman leased two Boeing 777-200ERs from EuroAtlantic Airways. These aircraft were used mainly on routes to European destinations to cover the interim period before the delivery of the first two new Boeing 777-300ERs in 2011. To secure the delivery of these two brand new 777-300ERs the airline used an initial  million loan granted from JPMorgan Chase. Wearing a new livery, the carrier took delivery of its first Boeing 777-300ER in late October 2011. It was the 777-300ER delivered by Boeing. The ever delivered Boeing 777-300ER also went to Biman. The airline took possession of it in late November 2011. The Boeing 777-300ER, named &quot;Aakash Pradeep&quot;, was handed over to the carrier in February 2014. The one, named &quot;Raanga Pravat&quot;, joined the fleet in March 2014, following the government approving a  million loan, of which  million will be provided by the Ex-Im Bank and the rest by the Standard Chartered Bank.

Biman retired its entire McDonnell Douglas DC-10 fleet on 20 February 2014, by operating a special Dhaka-Birmingham farewell flight with its last DC-10 with a stopover at Kuwait. The carrier also operated nine separate aviation enthusiasts&#x27; scenic flights at Birmingham, from 22 to 24 February, flying three flights a day. The aircraft was then offered for sale as scrap in Dhaka. The Airbus A310-300s were withdrawn from service in October 2016.

The carrier leased two Boeing 777-200ER aircraft from EgyptAir in March 2014. The airline planned to expand its fleet to 16 aircraft, to allow route expansion. With newly leased Dash 8-Q400 aircraft, the carrier resumed domestic flights in full swing to Cox&#x27;s Bazar, Jessore, Saidpur, Rajshahi and Barisal in April 2015. The two aircraft, dry leased from Smart Aviation Company for a period of five years, also operated on regional flights to Kolkata and Yangon. Initially it was supposed to resume in November 2013, which Biman failed to as it was unable to find a lessor of aircraft.

In February 2017, it was announced that the airline would acquire three of their own Dash 8-Q400 which will be used to replace the current aircraft leased from Smart Aviation Company to continue operating domestic and regional flights. Due to reliability issues with its Boeing 777-200ER aircraft leased from EgyptAir, Biman announced in December 2017 that the aircraft would be returned in March and May 2018, one year ahead of the expiration of the lease.

On 19 August 2018, Biman received its first of four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners and it was named &quot;&quot;Akash Beena&quot; in Bengali by the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, who inaugurated it on 5 September 2018 during an inauguration ceremony before its maiden commercial flight. The Dreamliner has this name inscribed on its side, below the cockpit, written in English on the port side and in Bengali on starboard. On 1 December 2018, the second of four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners was received, increasing the fleet of Biman to fifteen aircraft, and it was named &quot;Hangsa Balaka&quot; in Bengali with BG-2112 as its serial number. The last Boeing 787-8 named &quot;Raj Hangsha&quot;&quot; joined the fleet on 14 September 2019.

After receiving all four Boeing 787-8, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina showed interest to buy two more Boeing 787-9. As China-based Hainan Airlines cancels its 30 Dreamliner orders, Boeing approaches Biman and the latter agrees to buy two 787-9 at a negotiated price of 150 million for each aircraft. Both these aircraft joined the fleet on 21 and 24 December 2019 and these two aircraft are named as &quot;Sonar Tori&quot; and &quot;Awchin Pakhi&quot;.

====2020s====
In January 2020, Biman expressed interest in buying two more Dash-8 Q400NG short-bodied aircraft. This proposal is made to increase the frequency of the flights on domestic and regional routes. Besides, discussion is going on for taking four more Boeing 787-9 that was not taken up by Hainan Airlines and later on passed by Vistara. Besides, the airlines intended to buy cargo aircraft in future. In 2023 French President Emmanuel Macron, together with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, announced a large order of ten Airbus A350 aircraft for Biman Bangladesh Airlines during President Macron&#x27;s visit to Dhaka. The Airbus order consists of two A350F cargo aircraft and eight A350 passenger aircraft. Delivery of the aircraft will be done in stages with two passenger A350 aircraft joining the Biman fleet first.

All three Dash-8 Q400NG from the first batch of orders received by March 2021. Another two were ordered and will join the fleet by 2022. The number of Dash-8 aircraft will be six by 2022 (including one from lease). By adding Dash-8 Q400NG, Biman Bangladesh Airlines will stop using Boeing 737-800 planes on domestic routes. So Boeing 737-800 will operate on international routes only. Biman will also use Dash-8 aircraft on some short-range international routes.

===Livery===

In modern Bengali, the word বিমান &quot;Biman&quot; refers to &quot;aeroplane&quot;, originating from the Sanskrit word &quot;vimāna&quot;, a name given to a flying machine mentioned in ancient Vedic literature. The logo, painted on the tail, is a stylised white stork (বলাকা &quot;bôlaka&quot;) inside a red circle. The logo was designed by painter Quamrul Hassan. The initial livery was a dark blue line extending across the aircraft along the windows and covering the tail section. This was replaced in the 1980s by dark green and red lines, matching the colours of the Bangladesh flag, and has remained so for over two decades.
In 2010, Biman went through a rebranding exercise and unveiled a new logo and livery, designed by Teague, which was applied to its leased Boeing 777 and 737 aircraft. However, following change of government, Biman reverted to the original branding as this livery was not deemed appealing or colour appropriate for Biman or reflecting Bengali culture. The carrier has since adopted a new, more modern and revised version of its livery, that was applied to the new Boeing 777-300ERs, Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners, and all other aircraft delivered or leased from 2011 onwards.

The &quot;bôlaka&quot; has also given its name to the Biman headquarters, the &quot;Balaka Bhaban&quot; (বলাকা ভবন &quot;bôlaka bhôban&quot;, Stork Building). A landmark sculpture, named Balaka and depicting storks, is also found in front of Biman&#x27;s former headquarters, the &quot;Biman Bhaban&quot;, in the Motijheel Commercial Area of Dhaka. Eminent Bangladeshi sculptor; and mural, terracotta and landscaping artist, Mrinal Haque, designed and built this sculpture.

<text>The marabou stork (Leptoptilos crumenifer) is a large wading bird in the stork family Ciconiidae native to sub-Saharan Africa. It breeds in both wet and arid habitats, often near human habitation, especially landfill sites. It is sometimes called the &quot;undertaker bird&quot; due to its shape from behind: cloak-like wings and back, skinny white legs, and sometimes a large white mass of &quot;hair&quot;. It has often been credited with the largest wingspan of any land bird, with an average of and some recorded examples of up to .

==Taxonomy==
The marabou stork was formally described in 1831 by the French naturalist René Lesson. He placed it in the stork genus &quot;Ciconia&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Ciconia crumenifera&quot;. He specified that locality as Senegal. The species epithet means &quot;carrying a around the neck&quot;. The species is now placed with the lesser adjutant and the greater adjutant in the genus &quot;Leptoptilos&quot; that Lesson had introduced at the same time he described the marabou stork. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The common name marabou is thought to be derived from the Arabic word &quot;murābit&quot; meaning quiet or hermit-like. The species was originally described as &quot;Ciconia crumenifera&quot;. When the species was moved into the genus &quot;Leptoptilos&quot;, the ending was modified to &quot;crumeniferus&quot; and this was used by many authors until it was noted that the correct masculine ending to match the genus is &quot;crumenifer&quot;.

==Description==
The marabou stork is a massive bird: large specimens are thought to reach a height of and a weight of . A wingspan of was accepted by Fisher and Peterson, who ranked the species as having the largest wing-spread of any living bird. Even higher measurements of up to have been reported, although no measurement over has been verified. It is often credited with the largest spread of any landbird, to rival the Andean condor; more typically, however, these storks measure across the wings, which is about a foot less than the average Andean condor wingspan and nearly two feet less than the average of the largest albatrosses and pelicans. Typical weight is , unusually as low as , and length (from bill to tail) is . Females are smaller than males. Bill length can range from . Unlike most storks, the three &quot;Leptoptilos&quot; species fly with the neck retracted like a heron.

The marabou is unmistakable due to its size, bare head and neck, black back, and white underparts. It has a huge bill, a pink gular sac at its throat (&quot;crumenifer(us)&quot; means &quot;carrier of a pouch for money&quot;), a neck ruff, and white legs and black wings. The sexes are alike, but the young bird is browner and has a smaller bill. Full maturity is not reached for up to four years.

==Behavior and ecology==
Like most storks, the marabou is gregarious and a colonial breeder. In the African dry season (when food is more readily available as the pools shrink), it builds a tree nest in which two or three eggs are laid. It is known to be quite ill-tempered.

It also resembles other storks in that it is not very vocal, but indulges in bill-rattling courtship displays. The throat sac is also used to make various noises at that time.

===Breeding===
The marabou stork breeds in Africa south of the Sahara. In East Africa, the birds interact with humans and breed in urban areas. In southern African countries, the birds breed mainly in less populated areas. The marabou stork breeds in colonies, starting during the dry season. The female lays two to three eggs in a small nest made of sticks; eggs hatch after an incubation period of 30 days. Their young reach sexual maturity at 4 years of age. Lifespan is 43 years in captivity and 25 years in wild.

===Feeding===

The marabou stork is a frequent scavenger, and the naked head and long neck are adaptations to this livelihood, as it is with the vultures with which the stork often feeds. In both cases, a feathered head would become rapidly clotted with blood and other substances when the bird&#x27;s head was inside a large corpse, and the bare head is easier to keep clean.

This large and powerful bird eats mainly carrion, scraps, and faeces but will opportunistically eat almost any animal matter it can swallow. It occasionally eats other birds including &quot;Quelea&quot; nestlings, pigeons, doves, pelican and cormorant chicks, and even flamingos. During the breeding season, adults scale back on carrion and take mostly small, live prey since nestlings need this kind of food to survive. Common prey at this time may consist of fish, frogs, insects, eggs, small mammals and reptiles such as crocodile hatchlings and eggs, lizards and snakes. Though known to eat putrid and seemingly inedible foods, these storks may sometimes wash food in water to remove soil.

When feeding on carrion, marabou frequently follow vultures, which are better equipped with hooked bills for tearing through carrion meat and may wait for the vultures to cast aside a piece, steal a piece of meat directly from the vulture or wait until the vultures are done. As with vultures, marabou storks perform an important natural function by cleaning areas via their ingestion of carrion and waste.

Increasingly, marabous have become dependent on human garbage and hundreds of the huge birds can be found around African dumps or waiting for a hand out in urban areas. Marabous eating human garbage have been seen to devour virtually anything that they can swallow, including shoes and pieces of metal. Marabous conditioned to eating from human sources have been known to lash out when refused food.

===Threats===
Fully grown marabou storks have few natural enemies, and have high annual survival rate, though lions have reportedly preyed on some individuals in ambush. A number of endoparasites have been identified in wild marabous including &quot;Cheilospirura&quot;, &quot;Echinura&quot; and &quot;Acuaria&quot; nematodes, &quot;Amoebotaenia sphenoides&quot; (Cestoda) and &quot;Dicrocoelium hospes&quot; (Trematoda).

==Human uses==

Marabou down is frequently used in the trimming of various items of clothing and hats, as well as fishing lures. Turkey down and similar feathers have been used as a substitute for making &#x27;marabou&#x27; trimming.

<doc id="285804" wikidata="Q2722672" url="?curid=285804" title="Uniform Civil Code">
<text>The Uniform Civil Code is a proposal in India to formulate and implement personal laws of citizens which apply on all citizens equally regardless of their religion. Currently, personal laws of various communities are governed by their religious scriptures. Personal laws cover marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption and maintenance. While articles 25-28 of the Indian Constitution guarantee religious freedom to Indian citizens and allow religious groups to maintain their own affairs, article 44 expects the Indian state to apply directive principles and common law for all Indian citizens while formulating national policies.

Personal laws were first framed during the British Raj, mainly for Hindu and Muslim subjects. The British feared opposition from community leaders and refrained from further interfering within this domestic sphere. The Indian state of Goa was separated from British India during the colonial rule in the erstwhile Portuguese Goa and Daman, retained a common family law known as the Goa civil code and thus was the only state in India with a uniform civil code prior to 2024. Following India&#x27;s independence, Hindu code bills were introduced which largely codified and reformed personal laws in various sects among Indian religions like Buddhists, Hindus, Jains and Sikhs but they exempted Christians, Jews, Muslims and Parsis.

UCC emerged as a crucial topic of interest in Indian politics following the Shah Bano case in 1985. The debate arose on the question of making certain laws applicable to all citizens without abridging the fundamental right to practice religious functions. The debate then focused on the Muslim Personal Law, which is partially based on the Sharia law, permitting unilateral divorce, polygamy and putting it among the legally applying the Sharia law. A UCC bill was proposed twice, in November 2019 and March 2020 but was withdrawn both the times without introduction in the parliament. The bill is reported to be under discussion between the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Many opposition parties and BJP&#x27;s allies from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) have opposed the Uniform Civil Code, especially from Northeast India, claiming that it will go against the &quot;idea of India&quot; and will end special privileges of tribal communities after renewed calls by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June 2023 about implementing a UCC.

== History ==
=== British India (1858–1947) ===

The Lex Loci Report of October 1840 emphasised the importance and necessity of uniformity in codification of Indian law, relating to crimes, evidences and contract but it recommended that personal laws of Hindus and Muslims should be kept outside such codification. According to their understanding of religious divisions in India, the British separated this sphere which would be governed by religious scriptures and customs of the various communities (Hindus, Muslims, Christians and later Parsis). These laws were applied by the local courts or panchayats when dealing with regular cases involving civil disputes between people of the same religion; the State would only intervene in exceptional cases. Thus, the British let the Indian public have the benefit of self-government in their own domestic matters with the Queen&#x27;s 1859 Proclamation promising absolute non-interference in religious matters. The personal laws involved inheritance, succession, marriage and religious ceremonies. The public sphere was governed by the British and Anglo-Indian law in terms of crime, land relations, laws of contract and evidence—all this applied equally to every citizen irrespective of religion.

Throughout the country, there was a variation in preference for scriptural or customary laws because in many Hindu and Muslim communities, these were sometimes at conflict; such instances were present in communities like the Jats and the Dravidians. The Shudras, for instance, allowed widow remarriage—completely contrary to the scriptural Hindu law. The Hindu laws got preference because of their relative ease in implementation, preference for such a Brahminical system by both British and Indian judges and their fear of opposition from the high caste Hindus. The difficulty in investigating each specific practice of any community, case-by-case, made customary laws harder to implement. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, favouring local opinion, the recognition of individual customs and traditions increased.

The Muslim Personal law (based on Sharia law), was not strictly enforced as compared to the Hindu law. It had no uniformity in its application at lower courts and was severely restricted because of bureaucratic procedures. This led to the customary law, which was often more discriminatory against women, to be applied over it. Women, mainly in northern and western India, often were restrained from property inheritance and dowry settlements, both of which the Sharia provides. Due to pressure from the Muslim elite, the Shariat law of 1937 was passed which stipulated that all Indian Muslims would be governed by Islamic laws on marriage, divorce, maintenance, adoption, succession and inheritance.

==== Legislative reforms ====
Certain Hindu customs prevalent at the time discriminated against women by depriving them of inheritance, remarriage and divorce. Their condition, especially that of Hindu widows and daughters, was poor due to this and other prevalent customs. The British and social reformers like Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar were instrumental in outlawing such customs by getting reforms passed through legislative processes. Since the British feared opposition from orthodox community leaders, only the Indian Succession Act 1865, which was also one of the first laws to ensure women&#x27;s economic security, attempted to shift the personal laws to the realm of civil. The Indian Marriage Act 1864 had procedures and reforms solely for Christian marriages.

There were law reforms passed which were beneficial to women like the Hindu Widow Remarriage Act of 1856, Married Women&#x27;s Property Act of 1923 and the Hindu Inheritance (Removal of Disabilities) Act, 1928, which in a significant move, permitted a Hindu woman&#x27;s right to property.

The call for equal rights for women was only at its initial stages in India at that time and the reluctance of the British government further deterred the passing of such reforms. The All India Women&#x27;s Conference (AIWC) expressed its disappointment with the male-dominated legislature and Lakshmi Menon said in an AIWC conference in 1933, &quot;If we are to seek divorce in court, we are to state that we are not Hindus, and are not guided by Hindu law. The members in the Legislative assembly who are men will not help us in bringing any drastic changes which will be of benefit to us.&quot; The women&#x27;s organisations demanded a uniform civil code to replace the existing personal laws, basing it on the Karachi Congress resolution which guaranteed gender-equality.

The passing of the Hindu Women&#x27;s right to Property Act of 1937, also known as the Deshmukh bill, led to the formation of the B. N. Rau committee, which was set up to determine the necessity of common Hindu laws. The committee concluded that it was time of a uniform civil code, which would give equal rights to women keeping with the modern trends of society but their focus was primarily on reforming the Hindu law in accordance with the scriptures. The committee reviewed the 1937 Act and recommended a civil code of marriage and succession; it was set up again in 1944 and send its report to the Indian Parliament in 1947.

The Special Marriage Act, which gave the Indian citizens an option of a civil marriage, was first enacted in 1872. It had a limited application because it required those involved to renounce their religion and was applicable mostly to non-Hindus. The later Special Marriage (Amendment) Act, 1923 permitted Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains to marry either under their personal law or under the act without renouncing their religion as well as retaining their succession rights.

=== Post-colonial (1947–1985) ===
=== Hindu Code Bill and addition to the Directive Principles ===
The Indian Parliament discussed the report of the Hindu law committee during the 1948–1951 and 1951–1954 sessions. The first Prime Minister of the Indian republic, Jawaharlal Nehru, his supporters and women members wanted a uniform civil code to be implemented. As Law Minister, B. R. Ambedkar was in charge of presenting the details of this bill. It was found that the orthodox Hindu laws were pertaining only to a specific school and tradition because monogamy, divorce and the widow&#x27;s right to inherit property were present in the &quot;Shashtras&quot;. A Civil Code of western inspiration was recommended by Ambedkar. Ambedkar&#x27;s frequent attack on the Hindu laws and dislike for the upper castes made him unpopular in the parliament. He had done research on the religious texts and considered the Hindu society structure flawed. According to him, only law reforms could save it and the Code bill was this opportunity. He thus faced severe criticism from the opposition. Nehru later supported Ambedkar&#x27;s reforms but did not share his negative view on Hindu society.

The Hindu bill itself received much criticism and the main provisions opposed were those concerning monogamy, divorce, abolition of coparcenaries (women inheriting a shared title) and inheritance to daughters. The first President of the country, Rajendra Prasad, opposed these reforms; others included the Congress party president Vallabhbhai Patel, a few senior members and the Hindu fundamentalists within Indian National Congress. The women members of the parliament, who previously supported this, in a significant political move reversed their position and backed the Hindu law reform; they feared allying with the fundamentalists would cause a further setback to their rights.

Thus, a lesser version of this bill was passed by the parliament in 1956, in the form of four separate acts, the Hindu Marriage Act, Succession Act, Minority and Guardianship Act and Adoptions and Maintenance Act. It was decided to add the implementation of a uniform civil code in Article 44 of the Directive principles of the Constitution specifying, &quot;The State shall endeavour to secure for citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.&quot; This was opposed by women members like Rajkumari Amrit Kaur and Hansa Mehta. According to academic Paula Banerjee, this move was to make sure it would never be addressed. Aparna Mahanta writes, &quot;failure of the Indian state to provide a uniform civil code, consistent with its democratic secular and socialist declarations, further illustrates the modern state&#x27;s accommodation of the traditional interests of a patriarchal society&quot;.

=== Later years and Special Marriage Act ===
The Hindu code bill failed to control the prevalent gender discrimination. The law on divorce were framed giving both partners equal voice but majority of its implementation involved those initiated by men. Since the Act applied only to Hindus, women from the other communities remained subordinated. For instance, Muslim women, under the Muslim Personal Law, could not inherit agricultural land. Nehru accepted that the bill was not complete and perfect, but was cautious about implementing drastic changes which could stir up specific communities. He agreed that it lacked any substantial reforms but felt it was an &quot;outstanding achievement&quot; of his time. He had a significant role in getting the Hindu Code bill passed and laid down women-equality as an ideal to be pursued in Indian politics, which was eventually accepted by the previous critics of the bill. Uniform civil code, for him, was a necessity for the whole country but he did not want it to forced upon any community, especially if they were not ready for such a reform. According to him, such a lack of uniformity was preferable since it would be ineffective if implemented. Thus, his vision of family law uniformity was not applied and was added to the Directive principles of the Constitution.

The Special Marriage Act, 1954, provides a form of civil marriage to any citizen irrespective of religion, thus permitting any Indian to have their marriage outside the realm of any specific religious personal law. The law applied to all of India, except Jammu and Kashmir. In many respects, the act was almost identical to the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, which gives some idea as to how secularised the law regarding Hindus had become. The Special Marriage Act allowed Muslims to marry under it and thereby retain the protections, generally beneficial to Muslim women, that could not be found in the personal law. Under this act polygamy was illegal, and inheritance and succession would be governed by the Indian Succession Act, rather than the respective Muslim Personal Law. Divorce also would be governed by the secular law, and maintenance of a divorced wife would be along the lines set down in the civil law.

== Significance of Shah Bano case ==

After the passing of the Hindu Code bill, the personal laws in India had two major areas of application: the common Indian citizens and the Muslim community, whose laws were kept away from any reforms. The frequent conflict between secular and religious authorities over the issue of uniform civil code eventually decreased, until the 1985 Shah Bano case. Bano was a 73-year-old woman who sought maintenance from her husband, Muhammad Ahmad Khan. He had divorced her after 40 years of marriage by triple &quot;Talaaq&quot; (saying &quot;I divorce thee&quot; three times) and denied her regular maintenance; this sort of unilateral divorce was permitted under the Muslim Personal Law. She was initially granted maintenance by the verdict of a local court in 1980. Khan, a lawyer himself, challenged this decision, taking it to the Supreme Court, saying that he had fulfilled all his obligations under Islamic law. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Shah Bano in 1985 under the &quot;maintenance of wives, children and parents&quot; provision (Section 125) of the All India Criminal Code, which applied to all citizens irrespective of religion. It further recommended that a uniform civil code be set up, stating that a uniform civil code would promote national integration by eliminating conflicting loyalties to laws with divergent ideologies. Besides her case, two other Muslim women had previously received maintenance under the Criminal Code in 1979 and 1980.

The Shah Bano case soon became nationwide political issue and a widely debated controversy. Many conditions, like the Supreme court&#x27;s recommendation, made her case have such public and political interest. After the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, minorities in India, with Muslims being the largest, felt threatened with the need to safeguard their culture. The All India Muslim Board defended the application of their laws and supported the Muslim conservatives who accused the government of promoting Hindu dominance over every Indian citizen at the expense of minorities. The Criminal Code was seen as a threat to the Muslim Personal Law, which they considered their cultural identity. According to them, the judiciary recommending a uniform civil code was evidence that Hindu values would be imposed over every Indian.

The orthodox Muslims felt that their communal identity was at stake if their personal laws were governed by the judiciary. Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s Congress government, which previously had the support of Muslim minorities, lost the local elections in December 1985 because of its endorsement of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision. The members of the Muslim board, including Khan, started a campaign for complete autonomy in their personal laws. It soon reached a national level, by consulting legislators, ministers and journalists. The press played a considerable role in sensationalizing this incident.

An independent Muslim Member of Parliament proposed a bill to protect their personal law in the parliament. The Congress reversed its previous position and supported this bill while the Hindu right, the Left, Muslim liberals and women&#x27;s organisations strongly opposed it. The Muslim Women&#x27;s (Protection of Rights on Divorce) was passed in 1986, which made Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code inapplicable to Muslim women. The debate now centred on the divinity of their personal law. A Muslim member of parliament made a claim emphasising the importance of the cultural community over national by saying that only a Muslim judge could intercede in such cases. Bano later in a statement said that she rejected the Supreme Court&#x27;s verdict. It also led to the argument defining a woman&#x27;s right according to her specific community with political leader Jaffar Sharief saying, &quot;today, in the Shah Bano&#x27;s case, I am finding that many people are more sympathetic towards Muslim women than their own women. This is very strange.&quot;

The politicisation led to argument having two major sides: the Congress and Muslim conservatives versus the Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis, and the Left. In 1987, the Minister of Social Welfare, Rajendra Kumari Bajpai, reported that no women were given maintenance by the Wakf Board in 1986. Women activists highlighted their legal status and according to them, &quot;main problem is that there [are] many laws but women are dominated not by secular laws, not by uniform civil laws, but by religious laws.&quot; The legal reversal of introducing the Muslim Women law significantly hampered the nationwide women&#x27;s movement in the 1980s.

== Current status and opinions ==
=== Definition of the proposal ===
UCC is meant to replace various laws currently applicable to different communities which are inconsistent with each other. These laws include the Hindu Marriage Act, Hindu Succession Act, Indian Christian Marriages Act, Indian Divorce Act, Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act. Meanwhile, certain codes like Sharia (Islamic laws) are not codified and solely based upon their religious scriptures.

The proposals in UCC include monogamy, equal rights for son and daughter over inheritance of paternal property, and gender and religion neutral laws with regards to will, charity, divinity, guardianship and sharing of custody. These proposals may not result in much difference to the status of Hindu society, as they have already been applicable on Hindus through the Hindu Code Bills for decades.

=== Points of view ===
The debate for a uniform civil code, with its diverse implications and concerning secularism in the country, is one of the most controversial issues in twenty-first century Indian politics. The major problems for implementing it are the country&#x27;s diversity and religious laws, which not only differ sect-wise, but also by community, caste and region.

India is a &#x27;secular&#x27; nation which means a separation between religion and state matters. However, &#x27;secularism&#x27; in India is defined as equality of all religions and practitioners of all religions before the law. Currently, with a mix of different civil codes, citizens are treated differently by law and by courts based on their religion. The rights of Hindu women are far more progressive (and constitutional, by virtue of being gender-neutral and secular) than those of Muslim women, who are governed by Muslim Personal Law, which is based on the Sharia law.

Women&#x27;s rights groups have said the issue of a uniform civil code is only based on the rights and security of women, irrespective of its politicisation.
The arguments for it are: its mention in Article 44 of the Constitution, need for strengthening the unity and integrity of the country, rejection of different laws for different communities, importance for gender equality, and reforming the archaic personal laws of Muslims—which allow unilateral divorce and polygamy. India is thus among the nations that legally apply the Sharia law. According to Qutub Kidwai, the Muslim Personal Law is &quot;Anglo-Mohammadan&quot; rather than solely Islamic.
The Hindu nationalists view this issue in the concept of the Hindu law, which they say, is secular and equal to both sexes. In the country, demanding a uniform civil code can be seen negatively by religious authorities and secular sections of society because of identity politics. The Sangh Parivar and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), one of the two major political parties in India, have taken up this debate to gain Hindu support. However, others have criticised such a debate given the lack of existence of the draft of the bill.

The Indian state of Goa abides by Goa Civil Code. It is a set of civil laws, originally the Portuguese Civil Code, which continues to be implemented even after the Indian annexation of the state in 1961.

Sikhs and Buddhists objected to the wording of Article 25 which terms them as Hindus with personal laws being applied to them. However, this article also guarantees the right of the members of the Sikh faith to bear a Kirpan.

In October 2015, the Supreme Court of India asserted the need for a uniform civil code and said: &quot;This cannot be accepted, otherwise every religion will say it has a right to decide various issues as a matter of its personal law. We don&#x27;t agree with this at all. It has to be done through a decree of a court&quot;. On 30 November 2016, British Indian intellectual Tufail Ahmad unveiled a 12-point draft proposal, citing no effort by the government since 1950. The Law Commission of India stated on 31 August 2018, that a uniform civil code is &quot;neither necessary nor desirable at this stage&quot; in a 185-page consultation paper, adding that secularism cannot contradict the plurality prevalent in the country. On 14 June 2023, the 22nd Law Commission of India requested input from religious organizations and the general public regarding the matter of implementing a Uniform Civil Code (UCC). According to a notification released by the commission, individuals who are interested and willing can express their opinions within a 30-day time frame.

Indian society in pre-independence era had many other considerations like socio-economic status, jati and gotra etc. in case of marriages. While the Hindu Code Bills and other Acts wiped out all such practices in Hindu, Jains, Sikh, Buddhist, Parsi and Christian communities, some conservative sections of these communities had been demanding amendments to their Marriage Acts.

Critics of UCC continue to oppose it as a threat to religious freedom. They consider the abolition of religious laws to be against secularism, and the UCC as a means for BJP to target Muslims under the pretense of progressivism. However, BJP members state that they promote UCC as a means of achieving religious equality and equal rights for women by fending off unfair religious laws.

Legal expert and rights groups suggest amending gender discriminatory laws, rather than implementing a uniform civil code. An example of such a law is Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 which applies to women of all communities without the need for a uniform civil code.

On 17 July 2023, Justice Krishna Murari, who recently concluded his tenure in the Supreme Court of India, said that &quot;uniformity in anyway is beneficial&quot;, but before the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code, extensive deliberations and consultations, on a large scale, with the general public should take place.

On 7 February 2024, The Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly passed The Uniform Civil Code of Uttarakhand Act, 2024, making Uttarakhand. Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami describes it as a &quot;historic moment&quot; for the country. However, the law itself excluded Scheduled tribes and has faced criticism on technical grounds.

== Legal status and prospects ==
UCC had been included in BJP&#x27;s manifesto for the 1998 and 2019 elections, and was even proposed for introduction in the Parliament for the first time in November 2019 by Narayan Lal Panchariya. Amid protests by other MPs, the bill was soon withdrawn for making certain amendments. The bill was brought for a second time by Kirodi Lal Meena in March 2020, but was not introduced again. As per reports which emerged in 2020, the bill&#x27;s specifics are being contemplated by the BJP due to its topical differences with the RSS.

A plea was filed in the Delhi High Court which sought establishment of a judicial commission or a high level expert committee to direct the central government to prepare a draft of UCC in three months. In April 2021, a request was filed to transfer the plea to the Supreme Court so that filing of more such pleas throughout various high courts doesn&#x27;t bring inconsistency throughout India. The draft would further be published on the website for 60 days to facilitate extensive public debate and feedback.

UCC had been included in BJP&#x27;s manifesto for the 2024 Indian general election, but cannot be implemented in 18th Lok Sabha as their National Democratic Alliance lost two-thirds majority in that general election, the required majority to amend The Constitution of India.
== Reactions ==
Many political parties, ranging from opposition parties to the BJP&#x27;s own allies in the NDA, have objected to calls for a uniform civil code by the BJP. Furthermore, the idea of the UCC has been opposed by many NGOs and organizations.

A group from Nagaland warned that it will burn the houses of all the 60 legislators in the state if the UCC gets implemented in the state. The Nagaland Transparency, Public Rights Advocacy and Direct-Action Organisation opposed the idea of the UCC, saying it will erode local customs and traditions of tribes. The Hynniewtrep Youth Council from the state of Meghalaya said they will request the Law Commission not to implement the UCC.

<doc id="285808" wikidata="Q1651128" url="?curid=285808" title="Nonpartisan League">
<text>The Nonpartisan League (NPL) was a left-wing political party founded in 1915 in North Dakota by Arthur C. Townley, a former organizer for the Socialist Party of America. On behalf of small farmers and merchants, the Nonpartisan League advocated state control of mills, grain elevators, banks, and other farm-related industries in order to reduce the power of corporate and political interests from Minneapolis and Chicago.

The League adopted the goat as a mascot; it was known as &quot;The Goat that Can&#x27;t be Got&quot;.

== History ==
By the 1910s, the growth of left-wing sympathies was on the rise in North Dakota. The Socialist Party of North Dakota had considerable success. They brought in many outside speakers, including Eugene V. Debs, who spoke at a large antiwar rally at Garrison in 1915. By 1912, there were 175 Socialist politicians in the state. Rugby and Hillsboro elected Socialist mayors. The party had also established a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Iconoclast&quot;, in Minot.

In 1914, Arthur C. Townley, a flax farmer from Beach, North Dakota, and organizer for the Socialist Party of America, attended a meeting of the American Society of Equity. Afterwards, Townley and a friend, Frank B. Wood, drew up a radical political platform that addressed many of the farmers&#x27; concerns, and created the Farmers Non-Party League Organization, which later evolved into the Nonpartisan League. Soon, Townley was traveling the state in a borrowed Ford Model T, signing up members for a payment of $6 in dues. Farmers were receptive to Townley&#x27;s ideas and joined in droves. However, Townley was soon expelled from the Socialist Party due to this method of rogue operating.

The League began to grow in 1915, at a time when small farmers in North Dakota felt exploited by out-of-state companies. One author later described the wheat-growing state as &quot;a tributary province of Minneapolis-St. Paul.&quot; Minnesota banks made its loans, Minnesota millers handled its grain, and Alexander McKenzie, North Dakota&#x27;s political boss, lived in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Rumors spread at a Society of Equity meeting in Bismarck that a state representative named Treadwell Twichell had told a group of farmers to &quot;go home and slop the hogs.&quot; Twichell later said that his statement was misinterpreted. He had been instrumental in previous legislative reforms to rescue the state from boss rule by McKenzie and the Northern Pacific Railroad around the start of the 20th century.

=== Rise to power in North Dakota ===
Proposing that the state of North Dakota create its own bank, warehouses, and factories, the League, supported by a populist groundswell, ran its slate as Republican Party candidates in the 1916 elections. In the gubernatorial election, farmer Lynn Frazier won with 79% of the vote. In 1917, John Miller Baer won a special election for the United States House of Representatives. After the 1918 elections, in which the NPL won full control of both houses of the state legislature, the League enacted a significant portion of its platform. It established state-run agricultural enterprises such as the North Dakota Mill and Elevator, the Bank of North Dakota, and a state-owned railroad. The legislature also passed a statewide graduated income tax, which distinguished between earned and unearned income, authorized a state hail insurance fund, and established a workmen&#x27;s compensation fund that assessed employers. The NPL also set up a Home Building Association, to aid people in financing and building houses.

During World War I, Townley demanded the &quot;conscription of wealth&quot;, blaming &quot;big-bellied, red-necked plutocrats&quot; for the war. He and fellow party leader William Lemke received support for the League from isolationist German-Americans. However, the NPL&#x27;s initial success was short-lived, as a drop in commodity prices at the close of the war, together with a drought, caused an agricultural depression.

=== Decline ===
As a result of the depression, the new state-owned industries ran into financial trouble, and the private banking industry, smarting from the loss of its influence in Bismarck, rebuffed the NPL when it tried to raise money through state-issued bonds. The industry said that the state bank and elevator were &quot;theoretical experiments&quot; that might easily fail. Moreover, the NPL&#x27;s lack of governing experience led to perceived infighting and corruption. Newspapers and business groups portrayed the NPL as inept and disastrous for the state&#x27;s future.

In 1918, opponents of the NPL formed the Independent Voters Association. In 1921, the IVA organized a recall election which successfully recalled Frazier as governor. Frazier lost the recall election by a margin of 1.8%, becoming the first U.S. state governor to be recalled. However, a year later he was elected in the 1922 United States Senate election in North Dakota, serving until 1940.

The 1920s were economically difficult for farmers, and the NPL&#x27;s popularity receded. However, the populist undercurrent that fueled its meteoric growth revived with the coming of the Great Depression and Dust Bowl conditions of the 1930s. The NPL&#x27;s William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Langer was elected to the governorship in 1932 and 1936. Langer was later elected to the U.S. Senate, serving from 1940 until his death in 1959.

By 1950, two factions divided the traditionally left-wing NPL; on one side were the Insurgents, and on the other were the Old Guard. The Insurgents aligned liberally with pro-farmers&#x27; union, organized labor, and Democratic Party groups. The Insurgents wanted to merge the NPL with the North Dakota Democratic Party. In 1952, the Insurgents formed the Volunteers for Stevenson Committee, to help elect Adlai Stevenson II, the governor of Illinois and Democratic nominee for president. The Old Guard, also known as the Capitol Crowd, were more conservative, anti-farmers&#x27; union, anti-labor, and pro-Republican segment of the league, these members wanted to keep the Nonpartisan League aligned with the Republican Party; they supported General Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1952 presidential race. Over the following four years, legislative polarization grew and the Nonpartisan League eventually split in two. In 1956, the Nonpartisan League formally merged with the state Democratic Party, creating the North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party, while much of the League&#x27;s base joined the North Dakota Republican Party. The Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party introduced a unified slate of candidates for statewide offices and adopted a liberal platform that included the repeal of the Taft–Hartley Act, creation of a minimum wage of $1.25 an hour, and a graduated land tax on property worth $20,000 or more. In May 1956, the Democratic Convention accepted the Nonpartisan League&#x27;s candidates and adopted its platform, fully unifying the two parties into one.

Although the Democrats were still in the minority in the state government, the number of Democrats in the state legislature increased greatly. Before the league moved into the Democratic Party, there were only five Democrats among the 162 members of both houses of the legislature in 1955. By 1957, the number grew to 28, and in 1959 the numbers continued to grow, reaching 67.

==Representation in other media==
*&quot;Northern Lights&quot; (1978), a feature film starring Joe Spano, portrayed early 20th century conditions in North Dakota and the rise of the NPL among immigrant farmers. The film won the 1980 &quot;Camera d&#x27;Or&quot; award for best first film at the Cannes Film Festival.
*The didactic historical novel &quot;Harangue (The Trees Said to the Bramble Come Reign Over Us)&quot; (1926) by Garet Garrett tells the story of the Non-Partisan League and its various supporters after the league took control of the North Dakota government in 1919.

==Legacy==

*The NPL arose as a faction within the Republican Party in 1915. By the 1950s, its members felt more affiliation with the Democratic Party and merged with the North Dakota Democrats. The North Dakota branch of the Democratic Party is therefore known as the North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party to this day. The Executive Committee of the NPL still formally exists within the party structure of the North Dakota Democratic-NPL. It was at one point headed by former State Senator Buckshot Hoffner (D-NPL, Esmond), chairman, and former Lt. Governor Lloyd B. Omdahl, Secretary.
*The Nonpartisan League laid a foundation of enriched public ownership and responsibility in such institutions as a state bank. One study has drawn conclusions that publicly operated institutions such as the state bank have helped North Dakota weather these economic storms.
*The Bank of North Dakota was created to address market failures associated with monopoly power among large financial and business institutions in the early twentieth century. This market power meant that small farming operations had inadequate access to credit. One of the goals of the Nonpartisan League was to remedy limited access to credit by establishing this institution. A measure of the public good brought about by the Bank&#x27;s establishment that still stands today is what some have identified as the Bank&#x27;s role in reducing the impact of economic recession. The public-private relationship establishes roles assigned according to what each sector does best, allowing the mutual benefit of public and private banks balancing out inequality and building equality, thus creating an economic safety net for North Dakota citizens. These early roots of the Democratic-Nonpartisan League party have been celebrated for establishing a foundation that rights the state in times of national crisis and provides economic security to generations of the state&#x27;s farmers.
*The early success of the party in North Dakota spawned Nonpartisan League branches on the Canadian prairies, including the Alberta Non-Partisan League and another in Saskatchewan. Two Alberta NPL members were elected in the 1917 provincial election; the party was absorbed in 1919 by the United Farmers of Alberta, who would form government from 1921 until 1935. No NPL candidates were elected in Saskatchewan, but the party boasted the first woman—Zoa Haight—to run for office in the province.
*As of May 2021, both the North Dakota Mill and Elevator and the Bank of North Dakota continue to operate. The legislature in 1932 prohibited corporate farming and corporate ownership of farmland.
*The Fred and Gladys Grady House and the Oliver and Gertrude Lundquist House, both in Bismarck, North Dakota, are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as examples of the work of the Nonpartisan League&#x27;s Home Building Association.

<text>Maire-Ilon Wikland (née Pääbo; born 5 February 1930) is an Estonian-born Swedish artist and illustrator.

Wikland was born in Tartu, Estonia and raised in Haapsalu, Lääne County on Estonia&#x27;s Baltic coast. In 1944 she escaped with the family of a classmate from the second Soviet occupation of Estonia, to Sweden, where she arrived as a refugee.

In 1953 Wikland applied for a job as illustrator at Rabén &amp; Sjögren. She was met by Astrid Lindgren, who had just finished writing the book &quot;Mio, my Son&quot; and who could see immediately that Wikland was able to &quot;draw fairytales&quot;. Wikland did a test-drawing for the book and after that her collaboration with Lindgren continued. Wikland has said that Lindgren&#x27;s writing continually makes her see inner pictures. She also derives inspiration for her pictures from real life. In the same way that Lindgren wrote for &quot;the child within her&quot;, Wikland often also draws for the child within her.

Wikland is the artist who has illustrated the greatest number of Lindgren&#x27;s books:
* &quot;The Six Bullerby Children&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Children of Noisy Village&quot;)
* &quot;The Children on Troublemaker Street&quot;
* &quot;The Brothers Lionheart&quot;
* &quot;Karlsson-on-the-Roof&quot;
* &quot;Mardie&quot;
* &quot;Mio, My Son&quot;
* &quot;Simon Small Moves In&quot;
* &quot;Ronia the Robber&#x27;s Daughter&quot;
* &quot;Seacrow Island&quot;
* &quot;The Ghost of Skinny Jack&quot;
* &quot;The Red Bird&quot;.
She has also provided the illustrations for many picture books by Lindgren and many other writers, including &quot;The Dragon with Red Eyes&quot;, &quot;I Want a Brother or Sister&quot;, &quot;That’s My Baby&quot;, &quot;Brenda Helps Grandmother&quot;, &quot;Simon Small Moves in&quot;, and &quot;The Borrowers&quot;.

In 2004 Wikland decided to gift her original illustrations to Estonia. The artwork was originally exhibited in Wikland&#x27;s gallery in Haapsalu, Estonia. In 2009 &quot;Ilon&#x27;s Wonderland&quot;, a gallery and theme centre for children and families based on her works and illustrations, was opened in Haapsalu.

== Awards ==
Wikland was awarded the Illis quorum by the government of Sweden in 2002 for her &quot;outstanding ability to bring environments and characters to life from her own and Astrid Lindgren&#x27;s writings&quot;.

<text>Desaparecidos was an American punk rock band from Omaha, Nebraska founded by singer/guitarist Conor Oberst.

==History==
===Formation, Read Music/Speak Spanish and hiatus (2001-2010)===
The band formed in 2001 featuring Bright Eyes frontman Conor Oberst and several touring musicians from the same band and other life-long friends of Oberst&#x27;s, as Oberst looked for a different home for the politically charged music he had written. The band name, Spanish and Portuguese for &quot;disappeared ones&quot; is inspired by those from the forcibly disappeared under Augusto Pinochet’s right-wing military dictatorship in Chile between 1973 and 1990.. They released their debut EP &quot;The Happiest Place on Earth&quot; on October 2, 2001. The band was recording and mixing their debut record when the September 11 attacks occurred and originally planned to shelve the release, but later released their debut album Read Music/Speak Spanish on February 11, 2002, passing on major record labels to release it on Omaha based &quot;Saddle Creek Records&quot;. The record, while having favorable reviews, was criticized due to the timing of the release, with an attendee at one show calling them &quot;treasonous&quot; for performing it so soon after the September 11th attacks. The album later gained a cult following, and the band toured in support of it through 2002, including opening for Jimmy Eat World and Motion City Soundtrack, and being featured on an MTV &quot;You Hear it First&quot; episode.

Desaparecidos went on hiatus at the end of 2002. With the continually increasing success of Bright Eyes, Oberst did not have the time to dedicate to the band. Oberst continued to record with Bright Eyes, while the other members of Desaparecidos went on to form other projects. Matt Baum joined The &#x27;89 Cubs, later drumming Race for Titles and the Coffin Killers; Ian McElroy formed Rig 1; Denver Dalley moved onto bands Statistics and Intramural; Landon Hedges founded Little Brazil.

=== Reunion, signing to Epitaph, and Payola (2010-2015) ===
Desaparecidos reunited for a single show at the &quot;Concert for Equality&quot; in Omaha&#x27;s Benson neighborhood on July 31, 2010, which fundraised for ACLU Nebraska&#x27;s lawsuit against the city of Freemout, Nebraska in the aftermath of a referendum that attempted to barred undocumented individuals from residing in the town. In April 2012, the band launched an official website and announced that they would again reunite, this time to play Omaha&#x27;s MAHA Fest. In August 2012 the band embarked on a short tour, their first since 2002. Speaking on what took them so long to reform, Baum stated &quot;We were all just busy with different stuff. Obviously Conor was doing his stuff and I was trying to be an adult for a little while there and it didn’t work out. Real life is what happened, basically.&quot;

The band released two new tracks, &quot;MariKKKopa&quot; and &quot;Backsell&quot; in August 2012, the first recorded material since their return. The song &quot;MariKKKopa&quot; was written in reference to Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona and his outspoken stance and civil rights abuses he&#x27;s committed against undocumented immigrants.

In February 2013, the band made available two tracks, &quot;Anonymous&quot; and &quot;The Left is Right&quot; via stream through Rolling Stone. The songs deal with the Anonymous hacker group and the Occupy movement. On August 2, 2013, the band released a new single &quot;Te Amo Camila Vallejo&quot;, b/w &quot;The Underground Man&quot;, which was dedicated to the Chilean student activist Camila Vallejo.

On January 27, 2015, the band announced that they had signed to Epitaph Records. Speaking on the decision to sign with Epitaph over Saddle Creek, Oberst stated &quot;After years, it kind of soured a little bit and we happened to go our own way. I wish all of them the best, but we knew we weren’t gonna do it with them and we started talking about what label would make sense with our band, and what’s the label we respect, and can get it out there, and Epitaph was the very first one.&quot; On April 7, They released the single &quot;City on the Hill.&quot; on YouTube and announced their second album Payola, their first album in thirteen years. It was later released on June 23, 2015. and was co-produced with Mike Mogis. The album contains the six tracks released since reforming as well as eight additional tracks.

The band went on tour with Joyce Manor and The So So Glos to promote the new album, including a show at Shea Stadium that would later be released as a live album, and a slot at Riot Fest 2015. On October 28, 2015, Oberst was hospitalized due to &quot;laryngitis, anxiety, and exhaustion,&quot; and the rest of the bands remaining tour dates, including a benefit show that was to include Tom Morello, were cancelled and Oberst returned to his hometown of Omaha to recuperate. The shows were never rescheduled following the cancellations. Oberst later returned to working on solo music, and eventually reunited with Bright Eyes in 2020.

=== Second hiatus and re-releases (2016-present) ===
Since the cancellation of the tour in October 2015, the band has not toured or released new music. A 20th anniversary edition of &quot;Read Music/Speak Spanish&quot;, featuring remastered tracks and the two songs from &quot;The Happiest Place on Earth&quot; EP, was released on February 15, 2022. A live album &quot;Live at Shea Stadium&quot; was released April 1, 2022, featuring recordings from the bands performance at Shea Stadium in Brooklyn. New York on June 25, 2015.

==Musical style==
The band&#x27;s sound was labeled &quot;full-on emo-in-the-garage&quot; by &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, &quot;the sort of howlingly tuneful Midwestern punk that disappeared with Hüsker Dü&quot; by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;anthemic thrash&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and as such is noted for its sonic differences from Oberst&#x27;s primary band. They have also been hailed as the &quot;Saddle Creek supergroup&quot;. Hailing from Omaha, Nebraska, Desaparecidos&#x27; lyrics are mostly about the sociopolitical state of affairs in America. The band has been both lauded and criticized for its intentionally raw sound following the release of &quot;Read Music/Speak Spanish&quot;. In sharp contrast to Bright Eyes&#x27; confessional, even sometimes mournful lyrics, Desaparecidos&#x27;s angular, energetic and engaging vocals sound like those typically heard in post-hardcore.

<text>Eduardo Alfredo Juan Bernardo Frei Ruiz–Tagle (; born 24 June 1942) is a Chilean politician and civil engineer who served as president of Chile from 1994 to 2000. He was also a Senator, fulfilling the role of President of the Senate from 2006 to 2008. He attempted a comeback as the candidate of the ruling Concertación coalition for the 2009 presidential election, but was narrowly defeated. His father was Eduardo Frei Montalva, president of Chile from 1964 to 1970.

His presidency was marked by a consolidation of Chile&#x27;s transition to democracy albeit the indictment and arrest of Augusto Pinochet in his last year of government heated up national politics. Economically, he oversaw a period of rapid economic growth that was only temporarily stunted by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. 

In the 2020s he has taken political positions different from those of the Christian Democratic Party aligning more with the views of centrist and right-wing parties in the constitutional referendums of 2022 and 2023.

==Early life==
Frei was born in Santiago to Eduardo Frei Montalva and María Ruiz-Tagle Jiménez. He received all his schooling at the Luis Campino Institute. He then attended the University of Chile, where he graduated as a civil engineer, specializing in hydraulics. After graduation, he followed advanced courses in management in Italy.

==Political career==
Frei took his first steps in politics while at the university, where he was a student leader. In 1958, he joined the Christian Democrat party, and in 1964 participated actively in his father&#x27;s successful presidential campaign. Between 1969 and 1988 he concentrated on his profession, as one of the partners of Sigdo Koppers S.A., the largest engineering company in Chile.

In 1988 Frei founded and promoted the &quot;Comité Pro Elecciones Libres&quot; (&quot;Committee for the promotion of free elections&quot;). In 1989, he was elected Senator for Santiago, obtaining the highest number of votes in the whole country. In the Senate, he presided over the Treasury and Budget Commission and was a member of the Housing Commission.

==Presidency==


In 1992, Frei participated in the presidential primary election of his coalition, defeating Ricardo Lagos, and then went on to win the presidential elections of 1993 by securing 58% of the votes cast. 

He took office on 11 March 1994 and was succeeded by Lagos in 2000. Frei&#x27;s presidency was notable in making improvements in health and education as well as reducing poverty. 

Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, had particularly good relations with his Argentine counterpart Carlos Menem. During Frei&#x27;s ternure the Laguna del Desierto territorial dispute with Argentina was solved, albeit the arbitrage favoured the Argentine position.

Following the end of his presidency, Frei assumed, as a former President, a seat as senator-for-life in Congress.

==Return to the Congress==
Since constitutional reforms in 2005 abolished life senators from 2006, Frei ran for and won an elected Senate seat in the December 2005 parliamentary elections in the electoral district of Valdivia Province and Osorno Province, together with Andrés Allamand. On 11 March 2006, Frei became President of the Senate, like his father, who was also President of the Senate after being President of the Republic.

Frei, whose grandfather Eduardo Frei Schlinz had emigrated to Chile from Switzerland, obtained Swiss citizenship in February 2009.

In 2009–2010 elections, Frei ran for the presidency of Chile for a second time, again as the candidate of the centre-left Concertación center-coalition, promising continuity of the popular outgoing President Michelle Bachelet&#x27;s path. Some of his presidential campaign banners and billboards pictured him, accompanied by Bachelet over his left shoulder. In the first round of the elections, held on 13 December 2009, Frei held 29.60% of the official vote, second to his opponent Sebastián Piñera, who led with 44.05%. Since neither candidate received more than half of the total votes, a runoff election was held on Sunday, 17 January 2010. The first preliminary results announced by the Deputy Interior Ministry at 21:00 GMT on election day gave Piñera 51.87% and Frei holding 48.12%. Frei conceded to Piñera at 21:44 GMT.

In a graceful exit from the campaign, Frei stated, 
&quot;The election is over and Chileans have shown civic maturity... The results clearly show the solidity of our democracy. It has been clean and transparent in line with our tradition. I want to congratulate Pinera, to whom most Chileans have given their trust for the next four years.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="285836" wikidata="Q2254034" url="?curid=285836" title="Zach Gowen">
<text>Zachary Mark &quot;Zach&quot; Gowen (born March 30, 1983) is an American professional wrestler and promoter. Gowen competed for World Wrestling Entertainment and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.

Gowen&#x27;s left leg was amputated when he was eight years old. He is the first and only one-legged competitor ever to compete in WWE.

==Early life==
Gowen was diagnosed with cancer as a child, and lost his left leg due to amputation at the age of eight. He was a fan of professional wrestling from a young age, and cites Shawn Michaels and Rey Mysterio as two of his favorite wrestlers.

Gowen is an alumnus at Churchill High School in Livonia, Michigan, Class of 2001.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career===
After being trained by Truth Martini, Gowen made his professional wrestling debut on March 16, 2002, in a loss to Martini. While training Gowen made the decision to wrestle without his prosthetic leg as he found it difficult to wrestle with the &quot;dead weight&quot;.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003, 2005, 2006)===
Gowen first gained national exposure wrestling for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling during early 2003 under the name Tenacious Z. On the January 29 NWATNA PPV, Tenacious Z defeated Truth Martini in a dark match. On the February 5 NWATNA PPV, Tenacious Z defeated B.G. James. On the February 12 NWATNA PPV, Tenacious Z, Ron Killings and Jorge Estrada defeated BG James, Glenn Gilbertti and Mike Sanders. Afterwards Gowen left TNA, opting not to sign an official contract on the advice of Martini, who advised him WWE were likely to offer him a contract. In February 2003, Gowan signed a development contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).

Gowen later returned to TNA on May 15, 2005, at their Hard Justice pay-per-view event, as the second entrant in the 20-Man Gauntlet for the Gold match. He lasted just under five minutes in the ring before being eliminated by Shark Boy. The next month, Gowen wrestled at the Slammiversary pay-per-view, losing in a six-way match. He also appeared on &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, wrestling Mikey Batts to a no contest before leaving the promotion once again later that year. In October 2006, at Bound for Glory, Gowen returned to TNA during the Kevin Nash X-Division Open Battle Royal Gauntlet match as the sixth entrant, but was eliminated by Johnny Devine.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2003–2004)===
He made his World Wrestling Entertainment debut on the May 15, 2003 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as a planted fan in the audience, who attempted to help Mr. America when he was being attacked by Roddy Piper and Sean O&#x27;Haire. During the segment, Piper pulled off Gowen&#x27;s prosthetic leg. This began a short collaboration of Gowen and Mr. America, and a feud pitting the two against Roddy Piper and Sean O&#x27;Haire. This storyline culminated at the Judgment Day pay-per-view when Mr. America, accompanied by Gowen, defeated Piper, who was accompanied by O&#x27;Haire.

Gowen&#x27;s partnership with Mr. America put him on bad terms with Mr. McMahon, as McMahon was convinced Mr. America was Hulk Hogan in disguise. On the June 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, McMahon told Gowen that if he would join his &quot;Kiss My Ass Club&quot;, he would be awarded a WWE contract. Instead Gowen attacked McMahon. As a result, Gowen and Stephanie McMahon were put in a match against the Big Show, in what McMahon billed as the first &quot;real&quot; handicap match (referring to Gowen and his amputee status in addition to the two vs. one parameters of the match). With help from both Kurt Angle and Brock Lesnar, Gowen and Stephanie McMahon defeated the Big Show, winning Gowen a contract. Gowen&#x27;s win further fueled the ill-feelings toward him from Mr. McMahon. This feud culminated in a one-on-one match between the two at Vengeance in which McMahon defeated Gowen.

Gowen then lost several singles matches to wrestlers including Shannon Moore, Nunzio, and John Cena, with Gowen being attacked by Matt Hardy, Moore&#x27;s mentor, following each loss. The storyline was cut short on the August 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, when Gowen defeated Brock Lesnar by disqualification after Lesnar broke Gowen&#x27;s leg in storyline.

Gowen was absent from television for nearly a month, returning in an interview on the October 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; promoting his in-ring return for the following week. In his in-ring return, Gowen lost to Moore following interference from Hardy, reigniting their feud. As a result, Gowen and Hardy faced off in a singles match at No Mercy, which Gowen won. On the October 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Gowen lost to Tajiri in a singles match, and afterward was attacked by two of Tajiri&#x27;s associates. Gowen did not return to WWE television due to suffering an injury, and was later released from his WWE contract on February 4, 2004.

===Independent circuit (2004–present)===
Following his release from WWE, Gowen decided to focus on his education and work limited professional wrestling dates. He appeared for several independent promotions, including Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (IWA Mid-South) where he played the character of an egotistical heel (villain). Gowen was part of the Jeff Peterson Memorial Cup in 2004.

In All American Wrestling, he is also a part of the &quot;Michigan Invasion&quot; heel stable (along with fellow Michigan wrestlers Truth Martini, &quot;Amazing&quot; N8 Mattson, Eddie Venom and Brian Gorie). On April 14, 2007, Gowen and his mystery partner Krotch defeated &quot;Michigan Invasion&quot; members Truth Martini and &quot;Amazing&quot; N8 Mattson to become new AAW Tag Team Champions. They then lost the championship to Trik Davis and Conrad Kennedy III in a four-way elimination match on June 16, 2007.

In a circus-based independent wrestling promotion, Squared Circle Revue, Gowen portrays a one-legged boy, under the ring name, Pogo The 1 Legged Boy.

In Prime Wrestling, Gowen formed a tag team with Gregory Iron known as &quot;The Handicapped Handguns&quot;. The duo defeated The Dead Wrestling Society in January 2013 to become the Prime Tag Team Champions. They held the championship for three months, until losing it to Marion Fontaine and Jeremy Madrox on April 19. As the &quot;Handicapped Heroes&quot;, Gowen and Iron also won the Clash Tag Team Championship on April 27. On October 20, 2013, The Handicapped Heroes regained the Prime Tag Team Championship.

===Ring of Honor (2006, 2008, 2010)===
Gowen made his Ring of Honor (ROH) debut on October 7, 2006, losing to Delirious in a singles match. Gowen would later return to ROH on February 22, 2008, in Deer Park, New York, immediately aligning himself with The Age of the Fall. On November 12, 2010, he appeared at an ROH show in Detroit, where he was announced as the newest member of Truth Martini&#x27;s House of Truth faction. He teamed with ROH World Champion Roderick Strong and Michael Elgin in a loss to the Briscoe Brothers and Christopher Daniels. After a tag team loss to Grizzly Redwood and Bobby Dempsey at the following day&#x27;s event in Toronto, Elgin and Martini turned on Gowen and kicked him out of the House of Truth.

===Juggalo Championship Wrestling (2007–2008; 2011–present)===
Gowen debuted in Juggalo Championship Wrestling as a part of their 2007 internet wrestling show SlamTV!. Initially a villain, his hard work ethic and wrestling abilities earned him the respect of the juggalo audience, per storyline. Following a failed attempt to win the JCW Heavyweight Championship from then-champion Trent Acid, Gowen formed the tag team Pimp &amp; Gimp Connection with Human Tornado. The team made an immediate impact and earned themselves a spot in the 8 Team Tag-Team Elimination match for the JCW Tag Team Championship at Bloodymania. They failed to capture the championship after Gowen was eliminated by Doug Basham.

In the following season, Gowen formed a tag team with Conrad Kennedy to compete in the JCW Tag Team Tournament for the vacant championship. Tornado, though, saw villainous manager Scott D&#x27;Amore leaving Kennedy&#x27;s dressing room and grew suspicious. Two weeks later, Kennedy attacked Gowen after the team lost their match against The Bloody Brothers. Human Tornado ran into the ring to save Gowen, forcing Kennedy to retreat to the stage, where Scott D&#x27;Amore met with him. The following week, a match was set for Bloodymania II between Pimp &amp; Gimp Connection and Conrad Kennedy with a mystery partner. The match, however, was scrapped after Gowen legitimately no-showed the event.

Gowen returned to the company on March 23, 2011, where he defeated Jimmy Jacobs. He formed a tag team at Up in Smoke with U-Gene, who believed that he could be Gowen&#x27;s second leg. Though U-Gene cost his team the match by distracting the referee, Gowen forgave him and announced that the team would wrestle again at the next event. On July 28, Gowen and U-Gene defeated the Ring Rydas to win the JCW Tag Team Championship. However, Gowen forfeited the championship after realizing that U-Gene cheated to win, causing U-Gene to attack him and disband the team. Both men wrestled each other at Bloodymania 5, with Gowen emerging victorious after U-Gene was caught cheating again.

==Personal life==
Gowen attended Eastern Michigan University, where he studied Secondary Education and Mathematics. He has four children with his wife.

In 2016, Gowen competed in the Indianapolis qualifying round of the eighth season of &quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot;. He fell on the third obstacle, the fly wheels, and did not move on to the city finals.

Gowen released a memoir, &quot;High Risk Maneuvers&quot; in 2018 and currently tours as a motivational speaker for kids.

In August 2023, He delivered a compelling presentation titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Quit Your Daydream&quot; at Western Nevada College. During this event, he recounted overcoming significant life obstacles, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and self-belief.

<text>Read Music/Speak Spanish is the first studio album by American punk band Desaparecidos. Released in February 2002, the record is the forty-second release of Saddle Creek Records. Reviews were mostly positive upon release.

== About ==
&quot;Read Music/Speak Spanish&quot; is a punk/indie-rock concept album loosely centered on perceived American materialism and greed. Song topics include the pressures of upward mobility on marriage, the suburban expansion of Omaha, the desire to always follow the latest fashion or fad, the effect of consumerism on developing countries, and the mixture of religion and politics.

The album was recorded in one week, the same week of the September 11 attacks. Since the concept of the album is a criticism of American consumerism, the band considered not releasing it and partly due to this timing the album failed commercially. Despite its lack of commercial success, the album gained an extensive cult following.

<text>Kavitrayam (Telugu: కవిత్రయం) is a Telugu expression for trinity of poets. Kavitrayam popularly refers to the poets who translated the great epic Mahabharata into Telugu. The kavitrayam comprises Nannayya, Tikkana and Yerrapragada.


==Nannayya==

Nannayya was popularly hailed as the &quot;Adi Kavi&quot; or the first poet, and he belonged to Rajamahendravaram, an ancient city in East Godavari District of Andhra Pradesh. He was said to have lived during the years 1000 - 1100. Nannayya initiated the gigantic task of translation of the great epic Mahabharata into the Telugu language. But before he could translate everything, he had to revise Telugu by building new grammar rules and increase its vocabulary. Nannayya used many of the Sanskrit words directly in Telugu too. Thus Nannayya made Telugu more Sanskrit related. Thus a lot of Nannayya&#x27;s years were gone in the process of building a scaffold for the great task to translate the Mahabharata. However, he was still able to translate the first 2½ &quot;parva&quot;s (chapters) into Telugu.

==Thikkana==

Thikkana belonged to Paturu, or Kovur taluk of present day Nellore district, a territory in 13th century&#x27;s Kakatiya kingdom. Thikkana took over the task from Nannayya. He translated from the 4th to 18th chapters of the Mahabharata, almost completing the last. He could start the task of translation right from day one, because Telugu was considerably an improved language by the time. However, he never attempted the 3rd chapter due to his life span, thus still leaving the task incomplete.

==Yerrapragada==

Errana was a great Telugu poet in the court of Prolaya Vemareddy (1325–1353), the founder of Reddy dynasty (1325–1424) of Kondaveedu, who ruled Guntur, Prakasam, Nellore, and Kurnool districts with capital of Addanki. Errana was also known as Yellapregada or Errapregada. He was honored with the title Prabandha Parameswara (the supreme lord of Prabandha) and Sambudasudu. One of his greatest accomplishments were that he complete the full translation of the third chapter ending the task of getting the Mahabharatam to Telugu.

<text>:&quot;See Rotte (psaltery) for medieval harp psaltery &amp; Ancient Greek harps for earlier psalterion&quot;

A psaltery () (or sawtry, an archaic form) is a fretboard-less box zither (a simple chordophone) and is considered the archetype of the zither and dulcimer. Plucked keyboard instruments such as the harpsichord were also inspired by it. Its resonance box is usually trapezoidal, rectangular or in the form of a &quot;pig&#x27;s head&quot; and often richly decorated.

==Etymology==
The psaltery of Ancient Greece (&quot;epigonion&quot;) was a harp-like stringed instrument. The word &quot;psaltery&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek ψαλτήριον (&quot;psaltḗrion&quot;), &quot;stringed instrument, psaltery, harp&quot; and that from the verb ψάλλω (&quot;psállō&quot;), &quot;to touch sharply, to pluck, pull, twitch&quot; and in the case of the strings of musical instruments, &quot;to play a stringed instrument with the fingers, and not with the plectrum.&quot; The psaltery was originally made from wood, and relied on natural acoustics for sound production.

In the King James Bible &quot;psaltery&quot;, and its plural, &quot;psalteries&quot;, are used to translate several words from the Hebrew Bible whose meaning is now unknown.

==Characteristics==
While the Greek instruments were harps, psaltery came to mean instruments that were strung across a resonating wood box. The box-zither psalteries may have a Phoenician origin.
The strings of the medieval instrument were usually made of metal, unlike the finger-plucked harp, strung with catgut, and played using a plectrum or “pick.” The harp is strung with a single string for each tone, open to be plucked from either side of the instrument; a psaltery may have multiple strings for each tone, strung across a soundboard. The psaltery has been compared to the harpsichord and dulcimer, though some forms of the latter are not plucked, but struck with hammers.

==Medieval and Renaissance psalteries==
From the 12th through the 15th centuries, psalteries are widely seen in manuscripts, paintings and sculpture throughout Europe. Examples found in one reference book, the Groves New Encyclopedia of Musical Instruments, show examples in paintings from the 9th century Carolingian Empire Benedictine Psalter, in 13th century Spain (in the Cantigas de Santa Maria), in Bohemia in the 14th century, in Italy in the 14th century, and Germany in the 15th century.

Shapes included &quot;triangular (rotte), trapezoidal, semitrapezoidal, wing shaped, or harp shaped&quot;. The &quot;psalterion decacordum&quot; was shaped like a square and had ten strings strung vertically. Stings could run in courses, as viewed in the middle-ages artwork.

==Modern psaltery==
While psalteries had largely died out in Europe by the 19th century, the salterio remained common in Mexico well into the twentieth century and is still played in some regional styles.

The hammered dulcimer and related instruments, such as the santur, cimbalom, yangqin, and khim, appear very similar to psalteries, and it is often hard to tell which one historical images represent. They differ in that the player strikes the strings with small hammers rather than plucking them. As a result, they have much higher string tension and heavier frames.

In the 19th century, several related zithers came into use, notably the guitar zither and the autoharp. In the 20th century, the bowed psaltery came into wide use. It is set up in a triangular format so that the end portion of each string can be bowed.

<text>CHU is the call sign of a shortwave time signal radio station operated by the Institute for National Measurement Standards of the National Research Council. CHU&#x27;s signal is used for continuous dissemination of official Canadian government time signals, derived from atomic clocks.

== History ==
Radio time signals allowed accurate and rapid distribution of time signals beyond the range of the telegraph or visual signals. This was of particular value in surveying remote areas, where time signals allowed accurate determination of longitude. In the summer of 1914, a survey party at Quinze Dam in the Ottawa River watershed attempted to receive time signals transmitted from Kingston; however, signals were not resolvable and the time signal from NAA in Arlington, Virginia was used instead.

The station was started in 1923 by the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with a call sign of 9CC on an experimental basis until 1928. Regular daytime transmission began under the callsign of VE9OB in January 1929 on a wavelength of 40.8 metres (about 7.353 MHz). Continuous transmission at 90 metres began at the end of 1929, with other wavelengths being used experimentally. Time signals were generated from the observatory&#x27;s own pendulum clocks. The transmitter oscillators were condenser-tuned and so frequency stability was not high until quartz crystal control was implemented in 1933.

In 1938, the call was changed to CHU, operating on frequencies of 3.33, 7.335 and 14.67 MHz, at a transmitter power of only 10 W. The 1,000 Hz tone imposed on the carrier was derived from the quartz oscillator that determined transmit frequency, but the seconds pulses were still derived from the observatory pendulum clocks. The station automatically sent its call sign in Morse code once per hour, and pulses were coded to identify the time of day. Since the CHU power was not high enough to cover much of Canada, including survey parties working in the North, observatory time signals were also transmitted by a Department of Transport station with 2 kW power. In 1947, three new transmitters with 300 W power were installed for the three frequencies, relocated to the station&#x27;s present rural location. In 1951, a Collins transmitter rated for 3 kW was put in service on 7.335 MHz.

The purpose of the station was to provide accurate time-keeping information, especially to rural and remote areas that didn&#x27;t have local access to accurate time. The station also pioneered the use of microwave and satellite communication to transmit its signal to remote areas.

Initially, the signal consisted of a constant frequency interrupted by patterns of Morse Code pulses to indicate the time. In the 1930s, station identification via Morse Code was added to the transmission. Since deciphering even a simple time code &quot;by ear&quot; was occasionally difficult under field conditions, voice announcements of time and station identification were added to CHU in 1952, using a speaking clock made by Ateliers Brillié Frères of France. Fredrick Martin Meach of the Canadian embassy in Paris recorded the time announcements in English, which were stored on strips of photographic film and played back under control of the observatory clocks. In 1960, the speaking clock was replaced with one manufactured by Audichron corporation and rented by the Dominion Observatory; this unit had more intelligible voice quality and lower maintenance. New English voice announcements were recorded by Harry Mannis of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Bilingual announcements started in 1964, with French speech provided by Miville Couture of CBC Montreal. The station switched to digital audio in the 1990s.

Until 1959, the carrier frequency, tone frequency and second pulses were derived from independent sources, and the carrier stability as that of any commercial short wave transmitter. A divider chain was put into service so that all of the CHU signals were derived from Western Electric standard crystal oscillators with pulses for seconds monitored by continuous comparison with the observatory clocks. By 1978 all parts of the CHU transmitted signal were derived from an NRC-designed cesium beam frequency standard.

Also in 1959, the 14.67 MHz transmitter was replaced with a new 20 kW unit. All site antennas were replaced with vertical antennas by 1971. The station continued to be operated by the Observatory until 1970, when its operation was transferred to the Institute for National Measurement Standards at the National Research Council.

Effective January 1, 2009, the 7.335 MHz frequency was changed to 7.85 MHz. The change was necessary due to an ITU HF global reallocation at the 2003 World Radio Conference (WRC-03), where the 7.3 MHz range was reallocated to broadcasting. The power output was later reduced from 10 kW to 5 kW due to complaints from New Zealand that the signal was causing interference on its new frequency.

== Transmission system ==
The station is unmanned and equipped with modified 1960s-era 10 kW transmitters and is controlled remotely from the National Research Council&#x27;s headquarters on Montreal Road.

CHU transmits 3 kW signals on 3.33 and 14.67 MHz, and a 5 kW signal on 7.85 MHz. These nonstandard time signal frequencies were chosen to avoid interference from WWV and WWVH. The signal is amplitude modulated, with the lower sideband suppressed (emission type H3E). The same information is carried on all three frequencies simultaneously including announcements every minute, alternating between English and French. The CHU transmitter is located near Barrhaven, Ontario, 15 km (10 miles) southwest of Ottawa&#x27;s central business district.

The systems feeding the transmitters are duplicated for reliability, and have both battery and generator protection. The generator can also supply the transmitters. The announcements are made using digitally recorded voices. Individual vertical dipole antennas are used for each frequency. CHU has long been licensed as a &quot;fixed service&quot; within the band allocations of the International Telecommunication Union.

, CHU has three atomic clocks at the station, contained in a special enclosure to eliminate possible electromagnetic interference and compared with the atomic clocks at NRC&#x27;s headquarters.

CHU mails QSL cards to acknowledge listeners&#x27; reception reports.

== Time signal format ==

The primary time signal is a series of 300 ms-long tones, transmitted once per second, on the second. The following exceptions to the pattern provide additional information:
* The top of the minute is marked by a half-second-long beep.
* The top of the hour is marked with a one-second-long beep, followed by nine seconds of silence.
* The 29th second of a minute is always omitted (no beep).
* Between one and sixteen seconds past the minute (except at the top of the hour), CHU transmits the difference between UT1 and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by using split tones. For positive DUT1 values from +0.1 to +0.8 s, seconds 1 through 8 are split. For negative DUT1 values from −0.1 to −0.8 s, seconds 9 through 16 are split.
* Between 31 and 39 seconds past the minute inclusive, the once-per-second tones are reduced to 10-millisecond &quot;ticks&quot; while a digital time code is transmitted. The digital time code is formatted so that a Bell 103-compatible 300-baud modem can decode it, and CHU is the only time signal station that uses this format for its time code transmissions.
* For the last 9 seconds of each minute (seconds 51 to 59), the once-per-second tones are again cut to 10 milliseconds each, while CHU transmits a brief voice station identification, followed by voice announcements of the next minute in UTC, alternating between French and English. French announcements, using the voice of Radio-Canada news anchor Simon Durivage, are transmitted first on the odd minutes, while English announcements, voiced by late CBC Radio announcer Harry Mannis, come first on the even minutes.

The digital time code sends 10 characters at 300 bits per second using 8N2 asynchronous serial communication. This follows the Bell 103 standard, a 2,225 Hz tone to represent a mark (1 bit) and 2,025 Hz tone for a space (0 bit). Immediately after the 10 ms tick, a mark tone is sent until 133.3 ms, then 110 data bits, ending at precisely 500 ms. The final stop bit is extended by 10 ms of mark tone to ensure it is detected reliably, and the final 490 ms of the second are silent. The time of day (day of year through second) is transmitted twice during each second from 32 to 39. During second 31, additional information (year, DUT1, daylight saving time, and leap second warning bits) is transmitted.

A similar &quot;National Research Council Time Signal&quot; was broadcast by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) radio services daily at noon ET on Radio-Canada&#x27;s &quot;Première Chaîne&quot;, and 1 p.m. ET on &quot;CBC Radio One&quot;. Its last broadcast was on October 9, 2023.

== Western Canada signal coverage ==

CHU often cannot be received in Western Canada on any of its broadcast frequencies. Propagation conditions, low transmitter power coupled with the typical two ionospheric hops distances from Ottawa result in relatively weak time signals for Western Canada. Electromagnetic interference can further aggravate reception difficulty in urban areas in the West. CHU can be practically unusable in most of Western Canada, Nunavut, and the Northwest Territories, for significant stretches of time. U.S. stations WWV and WWVH are the fallback in Western Canada. In the high Arctic, however, both the U.S. shortwave time stations and CHU become essentially unusable or unreliable. Canada has no longwave time signal transmitters. The American station WWVB is the only option for reliable time signals during geomagnetic storms in the Western Arctic, based on WWVB&#x27;s published pattern maps. If WWVB is not available, those who need precision time transfer may be able to use GPS time transfer instead.

<text>Anuradhapura (; ) is a major city located in the north central plain of Sri Lanka. It is the capital city of North Central Province and the capital of Anuradhapura District. The city lies north of the current capital of Colombo in the North Central Province, on the banks of the historic Malwathu Oya. The city is now a World Heritage Site famous for its well-preserved ruins of the ancient Sinhalese civilisation.

While &quot;Mahāvaṃsa&quot; places the founding of the city in 437 , the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement on the island for almost three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Asia. It is the cradle of the Hydraulic Sri Lankan civilisation, Theravada Buddhism, and the longest-serving ancient capital of Sri Lanka that has survived for 1500 years. Moreover, It was the first capital of the Sinhala Kingdom of Rajarata, following the kingdoms of Tambapanni and Upatissa Nuwara. Anuradhapura was also the centre of Theravada Buddhism for many centuries and has been a major Buddhist pilgrimage site with ruins of many ancient Buddhist temples, including the famous Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya and the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, the oldest still-living, documented, planted tree in the world and that is believed to have originally been a branch of the sacred fig tree at Bodh Gaya (Bihar, India), under which the Buddha attained enlightenment. These vast networks of ancient temples and monasteries now cover over of area of the city today.

The city was mostly destroyed and largely deserted after 993 , with the Chola invasion from South India. Although several attempts were made by later Sinhalese kings to return the capital to Anuradhapura, it was not reestablished as a major population centre of the island until the British colonial era in the 19th century . Despite its political decline, Anuradhapura remained a vital pilgrimage site for Buddhists throughout the medieval period and continues to be an important spiritual destination to this day. The revival of the current city began in earnest in the 1870s. The contemporary city, much of which was moved during the mid-20th century to preserve the site of the ancient capital, is a major road junction of northern Sri Lanka and lies along a railway line. The city is the headquarters of Sri Lanka&#x27;s archeological survey, and tourism is a significant factor in its economy.

== Etymology ==
According to historical records such as Mahavamsa, the origin of the name Anuradhapura is traced to the minister named &#x27;Anuradha&#x27; in the court of Prince Vijaya (543–505 ), the first Sinhalese king of the island. According to the legends related to Vijaya, his minister named &#x27;Anuradha&#x27; established the settlement that later became Anuradhapura.

The name &#x27;Anuradhapura&#x27; means the &#x27;city of Anuradha&#x27; (Anuradha+pura), where &quot;pura&quot; stand for &#x27;city&#x27; in Sinhala, Sanskrit, Pali, and Tamil. However, before Anuradhapura was considered a city, it was called the &#x27;Anuradhagrama,&#x27; meaning the &#x27;village of Anuradha,&#x27; from &quot;Anuradha&quot; and &quot;grama&quot;. This older name was also mentioned in the work of ancient Greek and Roman scholars such as Strabo and Claudius Ptolemy. In Ptolemy&#x27;s world map from 2 century , the place was named &#x27;Anourogrammoi.&#x27; Thus, It is believed that the expansion of this earlier smaller settlement called Anuradhagrama into a city during the reign of Sinhalese king Pandukabhaya (474–367 ) in 437 caused the change of the name to Anuradhapura.

Significant milestones in the development of the name

* Naming the earlier smaller settlement after the minister &#x27;Anuradha&#x27; in the court of Prince Vijaya as Anuradhagrama (6th century ).
* Anuradhagrama stand for &#x27;village of Anuradha&#x27; (Anuradha+grama).
* Changing the name into Anuradhapura due to the expansion of settlement into a city during Sinhalese king Pandukabhaya (437 ).
* Anuradhapura stands for &#x27;city of Anuradha&#x27; (Anuradha+pura).

== Early history ==
Anuradhapura is the best representation of the beginnings of pre-modern urbanization in Sri Lanka. The development of the initial settlement at the site of the city can be attributed to the second global cycle of historical evolution with the generalised diffusion of iron technology in the Old World through the first millennium , culminating in the emergence of many historical civilizations. The history of Anuradhapura then extends from its traditional founding in the recorded history in the fourth century and its subsequent laying-out by Devanampiya Tissa (250–210 ) to its abandonment by the last of the Anuradhapura kings at the end of the tenth century , its brief reoccupation in the eleventh century and the restoration of some of its major monuments, in the late 13th century by Vijayabahu IV (1267–1270 ).

=== Iron Age ===
Even though, historical chronicle &quot;Mahāvaṃsa&quot; (5th century ) place founding of the city in the 5th century BC, the archaeological data from the excavation of the citadel area of the old city puts the date of the human settlement as far back as the 10th century BC. According to these excavations, protohistoric Iron Age of the city spans from 900 - 600 , with the appearance of iron technology, pottery, the horse, domestic cattle and paddy cultivation. In the time period 700-600 the settlement in Anuradhapura had grown over an area of at least 50 ha. Irrigable and fertile land surround the city, strategically situated with major ports northwest and northeast of the island. The city also benefited from dense jungle surroundings, providing a natural defense from invaders.

Excavation at Anuradhapura has unearthed Plain Grey Ware (in North India associated with Painted Gray Ware (PGW) pottery during vedic period) from the &#x27;Basal early historic&#x27; period of Anuradhapura (600-500 BCE) showing connections with North India.

=== Early Historic Period ===
Details of city&#x27;s development in this early historic period, spanning from 500 to 250 can be found in Sinhalese Chronicles. According to these records, King Pandukabhaya formally planned the city with gates and quarters for traders. The city at the time covered an area of one square kilometer, making it one of the largest cities in the entire Asian continent at the time. The city was largely deserted after the invasion by the Chola Tamil Hindu king Rajaraja I in 993 and his son Rajendra I in 1014 . According to Culavamsa (6th century -18th century ), Anuradhapura was &quot;utterly destroyed in every way by the Chola army. Still, the place was continuously inhabited after this event as indicated by records of visitors to the island such as Robert Knox and others. Thus, the city was the longest-serving Sinhalese capital of Sri Lanka from the 5th century BCE (437 ) until the 11th century (1017 flourishing for around 1,500 years.

===Buddhism===
Anuradhapura was a major intellectual centre for early Theravada Buddhism, home to revered Buddhist philosophers including Buddhaghosa.

During the reign of Dhatusena (455-473) a redaction of the Theravada Buddhist canon took place while at the same time 18 new vihara (temple complexes) were built and a statue erected for Mahinda, the Indian prince-monk who introduced Buddhism to the island.

During the late Anuradhapura period, the royal family and nobility of Sri Lanka strongly supported Buddhism. As such, they frequently commissioned works of art and donated these items to Buddhist temples. In return, the temple and local Buddhist community supported the king&#x27;s rule. Artworks featuring depictions of Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Mercy and Compassion, became increasingly popular.

==Modern era==
===European discovery===
The area was sparsely inhabited for many centuries, but the local population remained aware of the ruins. In Robert Knox&#x27;s 1681 &quot;An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon&quot;, he wrote: &quot;At this City of Anurodgburro is a Watch kept, beyond which are no more people that yield obedience to the King of Kandy&quot;. In 1821, John Davy wrote that: &quot;Anooradapoora, so long the capital of Ceylon, is now a small mean village, in the midst of a desert. A large tank, numerous stone pillars, two or three immense tumuli, (probably old dagobahs,) are its principal remains. It is still considered a sacred spot; and is a place of pilgrimage.&quot;

===Excavations ===

Various excavations have taken place at the site, beginning in 1884–86 by Stephen Montagu Burrows.

===Sacred city and new town===
Anuradhapura became the centre of administration of the North Central Province and with the building of the &quot;Northern Railway line&quot;, Anuradhapura became an important railway town with the opening of the Anuradhapura railway station in 1904. The Government of Ceylon tasked Oliver Weerasinghe to develop the Anuradhapura Preservation Plan in 1949, aimed at establishing a new planned town east of the existing Anuradhapura town, thereby establishing the Sacred city of Anuradhapura, with the aim of preserving the ancient city. The &quot;New Town&quot; had many of the government offices and law courts moved into it. The Anuradhapura Preservation Board was established with this aim.

Nissanka Wijeyeratne was Government Agent of Anuradhapura District from 1958 to 1962.
He was arguably the best known of all government agents of his time. His stature ensured that the voice of Anuradhapura was heard at the highest levels in Colombo. Apart from being Government Agent, he was Chairman of the Anuradhapura Preservation Board. This was the time when the city of Anuradhapura was in a period of historic transition. The new town of Anuradhapura was being built, and the residents of the old were being transferred to the new town. It was a time of some tension and of excitement. He managed this process of change with courage and remarkable political skills. While in Anuradhapura, he unveiled a memorial for H. R. Freeman, a popular British Government Agent who later was elected by the people of the district to represent them in the 1st State Council of Ceylon. Coming events cast their shadows before. A striking feature of Wijeyeratne&#x27;s Anuradhapura days was his great ability to see the bigger picture and focus on the key issues, and delegate responsibilities to his staff officers. He was never one to be enmeshed in detail. He also set up the Sacred City of Anuradhapura shifted the urban city to the newly created Anuradhapura town and is responsible for the establishment of Anuradhapura Airport.

<doc id="285859" wikidata="Q835316" url="?curid=285859" title="Antony Leung">
<text>Antony Leung Kam-chung (born 29 January 1952 in Hong Kong with family roots in Shunde, Guangdong) is a businessman who served as Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), from 29 May 2001 until his resignation on 16 July 2003.

He was embroiled in a financial scandal in early 2003 after it was revealed he had bought an expensive Lexus car shortly before imposing a new car tax, creating a controversy over conflict of interest that earned him the nickname &quot;Lexus Leung&quot; and which ultimately led to his resignation in July of that year.

Leung is currently the Chairman of Nan Fung Group and chairman and co-founder of New Frontier Group.

==Education==
Leung was educated in Hong Kong. He received his secondary education in Ying Wa College and holds a Bachelor of Social Sciences degree, majoring in economics and statistics, from The University of Hong Kong. During his university studies, he actively participated in student activities and was concerned with political issues. He was also a resident of St. John&#x27;s College. It had been a long-term goal of Leung to be Financial Secretary, according to some classmates. He completed Harvard Business School&#x27;s Programme in Management Development in 1982 and the six-week Advanced Management Programme in 1999. He received an honorary Doctor of Laws at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 1998.

==Career==
Leung started his banking career as a currency trader and spent 23 years with Citicorp where he took up regional management positions in investment, corporate and private banking in Hong Kong, New York, Singapore and Manila. Leung rose to senior management positions at big international banks in Hong Kong. He joined Chase Manhattan Corporation in 1996, where he rose to the rank of Asia-Pacific chairman. He oversaw the Asia-Pacific operation of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., which became the No.2 U.S. bank when commercial bank Chase Manhattan bought Wall Street investment firm J.P.Morgan in 2000. He relocated to Singapore shortly before he resigned from J.P.Morgan to become Financial Secretary.

Prior to becoming Financial Secretary, he was actively involved in public services. He was an unofficial member of the Executive Council (1997–2001 April) and was responsible for Education Reform when he was the Chairman of Education Commission (1998–2001 April). The Chair of the Commission was succeeded by Dame Rosanna Wong Yick-ming, the former Chairperson of the Housing Authority who resigned before a vote of no confidence in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong following a scandal concerning the improper construction of housing estates under the Home Ownership Scheme.

==Financial Secretary==
Leung became Financial Secretary government post on 1 May 2001.

When in office, he proposed, in 2001, to cut the salaries of civil servants by 4.5%. However, in the face of strong opposition, the cut was reduced to 1.8–2.3% and enacted through legislation. After that, the government proposed a further 3% in salary cuts over the following 2 years, 2005 and 2006.

He also stated that the government should succeed in balancing the budget by the 2006–07 fiscal year due to the recovery of the economy and further cuts in government expenditure. He claimed that it was necessary to balance the budget as quickly as possible so as to maintain the stability of the economy. He suggested expenditure cuts in different sectors, including university funding.

In September 2002, new HK$10 notes were co-issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong government in response to the problem of fake 10-dollar coins. About 10 special features were applied to the new notes.

By the end of 2002, in response to the &quot;penny stock&quot; incident, he set up a 2-person commission, which he was in charge of, to investigate the incident.

===Harbour Fest===

After the outbreak of SARS, Leung was responsible for taking action to reinvigorate Hong Kong&#x27;s economy. After receiving funding of HKD 1 billion from the Legislative Council, Leung was able to launch several initiatives including the &quot;Harbour Fest&quot;. Following his resignation, however, the Fest became mired in controversy regarding the chaotic arrangements made with overseas artists like the Rolling Stones, and the financial relationship between the government and the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong to which inexperienced body had been entrusted the Fest&#x27;s organisation.

Henry Tang, who became Financial Secretary after Leung, said in a TV interview on 29 October 2008 that the contracts between the government and AmCham were signed when Leung was still in office. &quot;AmCham came up with this creative idea for a musical event... [which] required us to grant it five years&#x27; custodial rights, I believe then financial secretary [Leung] thought it was reasonable.&quot;

Tang later clarified that the contracts were signed by Rowse and not Leung. Tang said Rowse was a civil servant and as such was not required to be held politically responsible.

===CEPA===
Before his resignation, he signed the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) with China, which, it was believed, could help Hong Kong get out of a prolonged economic downturn.

===The &quot;Lexusgate&quot; scandal and resignation===
Leung came under severe criticism in January 2003 when he bought a HK$790,000 (US$101,282) Lexus LS 430, just weeks before he raised the tax on new vehicles in his March budget. Although Leung claimed that he had decided on the tax increase after buying the car, which he said his family needed because of the arrival of his first-born in February. Leung denied that he was trying to avoid the new tax, which would have cost him an additional HK$180,000. (US$23,000). However, unlike other members of the Executive Council, Leung had failed to disclose the purchase to the council. News of the car purchase dealt a blow to the Hong Kong government&#x27;s credibility as well as to the effectiveness of the newly introduced Principal Officials Accountability System (POAS).

In view of the public outcry, he tried to defuse the controversy by donating money to the Community Chest, a local charity. He also submitted his resignation in March, which Chief Executive of Hong Kong Tung Chee-hwa refused to accept at the time. The government&#x27;s unwillingness to take action after the scandal broke brought into question the sincerity of Tung&#x27;s commitment to establishing an accountable government.

Hong Kong&#x27;s Department of Justice said in July 2003, after receiving a report from the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), that it was considering whether to charge Leung over the car controversy, which came to be known as &quot;Lexusgate&quot;.

On 16 July 2003 Leung resigned with immediate effect in the wake of mass protests over the government&#x27;s handling of a controversial anti-subversion bill, having failed to reduce record high unemployment and revive battered consumer confidence. His resignation came just hours after Secretary for Security Regina Ip said she was stepping down, for personal reasons.

On 15 December 2003, the Department of Justice announced that it was dropping the case against Leung.

==Return to private sector==

He served as the chairman of Blackstone Group&#x27;s Asian office in Hong Kong. He continues to serve as a senior adviser to Blackstone and a member of its international advisory board.

Leung has served as chairman at Nan Fung Group, the Hong Kong-based property and finance conglomerate, since February 2014.

Leung is currently the chairman and co-founder of New Frontier Group, an investment holding company with activities in healthcare, education and internet business.

He is also actively involved in charities, serving as chairman of the board of directors of Heifer International&#x27;s Hong Kong branch.

<doc id="285860" wikidata="Q7281103" url="?curid=285860" title="Radio VNG">
<text>Radio VNG was Australia&#x27;s national time signal service. It was inaugurated by the Australian Post Office at Lyndhurst, Victoria on 21 September 1964, although a predecessor service using the callsign VLX had begun in March 1946 alongside shortwave radio station VLR.
From 1964 until 1987, Radio VNG transmitted on 4.5, 7.5 and 12 MHz from the Lyndhurst transmitters. After 1987 it relocated to Shanes Park, NSW, and transmitted on 2.5, 5, 8.638, 12.984, and 16 MHz.

==Signal properties==
Radio VNG broadcast time in binary coded decimal, during seconds 21–58. It also broadcast DUT-1 information during seconds 1-16. Tones were usually of 1 kHz. Encoding details are described in the VNG Leaflet (see Further Reading). Radio VNG also broadcast a spoken time signal every 15 minutes. The exact words in earlier years were: &quot;This is VNG Lyndhurst, Victoria, Australia on 4.5, 7.5 or 12 MHz. VNG is a standard frequency and time signal service of the Australian Telecommunications Commission. This is VNG Lyndhurst, Victoria, Australia on 4.5, 7.5 or 12 MHz.&quot; If a leap second were to be introduced, a further voice announcement occurred.

==Historical==
The original service (Lyndhurst) was shut down in October 1987, due to a lack of funding. The area has since been converted to housing estates with the only hints to the former site at Lyndhurst and the vast antenna arrays for VNG and other radio services ever existing is &quot;Tower Hill Park&quot; and a road called &quot;Towerhill Boulevard&quot;. The original Lyndhust site was owned by the Commonwealth of Australia and the boundaries of the site were essentially a triangle shape formed by the South Gippsland Highway, Hallam Road and Lynbrook Boulevard.

The replacement Radio VNG service operated from , Shanes Park, Llandillo, NSW, until 30 June 2002 on 2.5 and 8.838 MHz. The remaining three transmitters (5, 12.984, and 16 MHz) were finally closed down on 31 December 2002.

==Currently available time signals==
Many scientific and astronomical users of the service were somewhat inconvenienced with the shutdown of Radio VNG.

Daytime reception of overseas shortwave and longwave time signal services in Australia (and New Zealand) is rather poor as the nearest HF (and longwave) time signal services are BPM (China), JJY (Japan), WWVH (Hawaii, USA) and WWV (Colorado, USA).

<doc id="285868" wikidata="Q1467" url="?curid=285868" title="Cebu City">
<text>Cebu City, officially the City of Cebu (; ), is a highly urbanized city in the Central Visayas region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 964,169 people, making it the sixth-most populated city in the nation and the most populous in the Visayas and the Central Visayas Region.

It serves as the capital of Cebu wherein it is geographically situated and grouped under the province by the Philippine Statistics Authority, but is one of three cities (together with Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue) that are administratively independent of the provincial government and also the largest city within that province. It also serves as the regional center of Central Visayas, and its metropolitan area exerts influence on commerce, trade, industry, education, culture, tourism, and healthcare beyond the region, over Central and Eastern Visayas and partly over Mindanao. It is the Philippines&#x27; main domestic shipping port and is home to about 80% of the country&#x27;s domestic shipping companies. Additionally, Cebu City is the prime trading center of the southern Philippines.

Cebu City is bounded on the north by the town of Balamban and the city of Danao, on the west by the city of Toledo, on the east by the cities of Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue and the towns of Liloan, Consolacion and Compostela and to the south by the city of Talisay. Located at the center of the eastern seaboard of Cebu Island, it is the core city of Metro Cebu, the second largest metropolitan area in the Philippines, which includes the cities of Carcar, Danao, Lapu-Lapu, Mandaue, Naga and Talisay and the municipalities (towns) of Compostela, Consolacion, Cordova, Liloan, Minglanilla and San Fernando. Metro Cebu had a total population of 3,165,799 as of the 2020 census.

The current political boundaries of the city are an incorporation of the former municipalities of Cebu, San Nicolas, El Pardo, Mabolo, Talamban and Banilad in the Commonwealth period.

The city has experienced rapid economic growth since the 1990s, a phenomenon also known as &quot;Ceboom&quot;. Owing to its economic importance and influence in modern times, Cebu City is also popularly referred to as the &quot;Queen City of the South&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;sugbú&quot; in Cebuano means &quot;to dive into water&quot;, and also in Tagalog, Hiligaynon, Aklanon, and Mansaka languages with more or less the same meaning. The name is probably derived from the Proto-Philippine word *&quot;sug(e)bu&quot; meaning &quot;to wade into water&quot;. As with most settlements in the Philippines whose common origin is either derived from an abundance of plants, for example, Manila and one of the most common names of cities in the Philippines, Talisay and settlements near a body of water, for example, Iloilo and the island of Mindanao. Early iterations of the name include Çubu, and Zubu, and then eventually &quot;Cebu&quot;. Thus, the modern name is either probably a 16th–17th century Spanish pronunciation of the native name or as how it was heard by early chroniclers in that time period. The Selden Map records the island known to the Ming dynasty as &quot;sokbu&quot; (束務), a Hokkien pronunciation of the name (in Mandarin Chinese &quot;suwu&quot;), in the early 17th century.

==History==
=== Pre-Hispanic period ===
Very little is known about when the site was first settled prior to colonization, but artifacts have been discovered near the city, if not exactly at the site in what is now Cebu City dating back to at least the 14th to 15th centuries CE. Other geological and archaeological studies revealed that Cebu as a settlement began sometime during the 10th century CE. Though there are artifacts detailing the settlement of the island as early as 2000 BCE, the exact date of when the village was settled and named &quot;Sugbu&quot; is unknown, since prior to colonization most Visayans were illiterate up until the later half of the 16th century. 

The city&#x27;s only reliable historical record started with Portuguese explorer, Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s landing in the island in 1521 CE and then after the Battle of Mactan, it is then followed by a brief period of silence and almost nihility, and back again in 1565 CE when Miguel López de Legazpi led an expedition back to the island. When Magellan and crew arrived in 1521 CE, the Europeans did not mention or state a thriving city in a European or Chinese sense and nor it was ever been described as a &quot;kingdom&quot; as there were no kingdoms in pre-colonial Philippines other than it was merely a simple fishing and trading village. However, this notion is challenged by a new translation of ancient Chinese Annals, a kingdom called &quot;Suwu&quot; was mentioned in the 1225 Chinese Annals, the Zhufan Zhi (諸蕃志), and during the 17th Century this was the same name used for Cebu among Chinese traders to the Philippines, thus, it is presumed to be the same location.

Cebu was referenced in association with Boni (Brunei) wherein it was written:

There is a popular myth that the city was supposedly founded by &quot;Sri Lumay&quot; and that the place was once &quot;Kang Sri Lumayng Sugbo&quot;. However, the authenticity of this source is highly debatable and should not be taken seriously. There are no existing documents predating Spanish chroniclers that made a reference to the island, and there was no mention of the so-called &quot;Sri Lumay&quot;. Fr. Francisco Ignacio Alcina&#x27;s &quot;History of the Bisayan Islands&quot; does not even mention the epic or any reference to that person. Also, in the compilation of Spanish accounts by esteemed American historian specializing in Philippine history, William Henry Scott, there is no mention of any scorched earth tactics in Visayan warfare. It is likely then that the &quot;legend&quot; is an invention by Jovito Abellana. The supposed capital city, &quot;Singhapala&quot;, was also not mentioned as a capital city. Instead, Antonio Pigafetta, a chronicler in Magellan&#x27;s crew, records &quot;Cingapola&quot; as a town, whose chiefs are &quot;Cilaton, Ciguibucan, Cimaninga, Cimaticat,&quot; and &quot;Cicanbul&quot;&quot;.&quot; If it were a rich city, it would be very unlikely to be ignored by the chronicler, and also by the absence of Indian stone structures were not found nor erected before the late 16th to the 17th century.

Despite the smallness of the polity of Cebu it borrowed a considerable degree of Indo–Malay culture as its more well-developed advanced neighbors like Butuan in Southeast Asia which it had dynastic links to, as Rajah Siagu of Butuan was the cousin of Rajah Humabon, and also proven by the titles of native Cebuano nobility, wherein Chief Humabon (mistakenly referred as a &quot;king&quot; in Pigafetta&#x27;s writings) was addressed in the Sanskrit title of &quot;Rajah&quot;. Tupas, also known as Rajah Tupas who was the chief of Cebu in 1565, descended from the brother of Rajah Humabon who was a &quot;Bendara&quot; which means &quot;Treasurer&quot; or &quot;Vizier&quot; in Sanskritized Malay and is a shortening of the word &quot;Bendahara&quot; (भाण्डार) which means &quot;Storage house&quot; in Sanskrit.

===Spanish period===


On April 7, 1521, Portuguese explorer at the service of the Spanish Crown and leader of the first expedition to circumnavigate the world, Ferdinand Magellan, landed in Cebu. He was welcomed by Rajah Humabon. Magellan, however, was killed in the Battle of Mactan, and the remaining members of his expedition left Cebu soon after several of them were poisoned by Humabon, who was fearful of foreign occupation. The last ruler of Sugbo, prior to Spanish colonization, was Rajah Humabon&#x27;s nephew, Rajah Tupas (d. 1565).On February 13, 1565, Spanish and (probably some) Mexican conquistadors led by Miguel López de Legazpi together with Augustinian friars whose prior was Andrés de Urdaneta, left New Spain (modern Mexico) and arrived in Samar, taking possession of the island thereafter. They Christianized some natives and Spanish remnants in Cebu. Afterwards, the expedition visited Leyte, Cabalian, Mazaua, Camiguin and Bohol where the famous &quot;Sandugo&quot; or blood compact was performed between López de Legazpi and Datu Sikatuna, the chieftain of Bohol on March 16, 1565. The Spanish arrived in Cebu on April 15, 1565. They then attempted to parley with the local ruler, Rajah Tupas, but found that he and the local population had abandoned the town. Rajah Tupas presented himself at their camp on May 8, feast of the Apparition of Saint Michael the Archangel, when the island was taken possession of on behalf of the Spanish King. The Treaty of Cebu was formalized on July 3, 1565. López de Legazpi&#x27;s party named the new city &quot;Villa de San Miguel de Cebú&quot; (later renamed &quot;Ciudad del Santísimo Nombre de Jesús).&quot; In 1567 the Cebu garrison was reinforced with the arrival of 2,100 soldiers from New Spain (Mexico). The growing colony was then fortified by Fort San Pedro. Aside from these Mexican soldiers, the city of Cebu was founded by 80 Spanish colonists from Spain.
By 1569, the Spanish settlement in Cebu had become important as a safe port for ships from Mexico and as a jumping-off point for further exploration of the archipelago. Small expeditions led by Juan de Salcedo went to Mindoro and Luzon, where he and Martín de Goiti played a leading role in the subjugation of the Kingdoms of Tundun and Seludong in 1570. One year later, López de Legazpi departed Cebu to discuss a peace pact with the defeated Rajahs. An agreement between the conquistadors and the Rajahs to form a city council paved the way for the establishment of a new settlement and the construction of the Christian walled city of Intramuros on the razed remains of Islamic Manila, then a vassal-state of the Sultanate of Brunei.

In 1571, the Spanish carried over infantry from Mexico, to raise an army of Christian Visayan warriors from Cebu and Iloilo as well as mercenaries from the Tagalog region and assaulted the Sultanate of Brunei in what is known as the Castilian War. The war also started the Spanish–Moro Wars waged between the Christian Visayans and Muslim Mindanao, wherein Moros burned towns and conducted slave raids in the Visayas islands and selling the slaves to the Sultanates of the Malay Archipelago and the Visayans fought back by establishing Christian fort-cities in Mindanao, cities such as Zamboanga City.

On August 14, 1595, Pope Clement VIII created the diocese of Cebu as a suffragan to the Archdiocese of Manila. The years: 1603, 1636, 1670, and 1672; saw the deployment of 86, 50, 135, and 135; Latin-American soldiers from Mexico at Cebu. In 1608, Muslim Moros from Magindanao raided the nearby Visayan province of Carigara in Leyte. Cebu under Commander Salgado led an expedition of 70 Spanish and 60 Pampango marines that had intercepted and destroyed them. On January 6, 1635; under orders by Juan de Alcarazo the Alcalde-Mayor of Cebu, a force of 50 Spanish and 1,000 Visayan troops, battled rebels who had uprisings at and settled in Bohol. At April 5, 1635: Cebu sent a force of 300 Spanish and 1,000 Visayan troops to settle and colonize Zamboanga City under the command of Captain Juan de Chavez. In the 1700s, Cebu housed 625 Spanish Filipino families and 28,112 native families

On April 3, 1898, local revolutionaries led by the Negrense Leon Kilat rose up against the Spanish colonial authorities and took control of the urban center after three days of fighting. The uprising was only ended by the treacherous murder of Leon Kilat and the arrival of soldiers from Iloilo and Manila. On December 26, 1898, the Spanish Governor, General Montero, evacuated his troops to Zamboanga, turning over government property to Pablo Mejia. The next day, a provincial government was formed under Luis Flores as president, General Juan Climaco as military chief of staff, and Julio Llorente as mayor.

===American occupation and World War II===

The signing of the Treaty of Paris at the end of the Spanish–American War provided for the cession of Cebu along with the rest of the Philippine Islands to the United States until the formation of the Commonwealth Era (1935–46). On February 21, 1899, the USS Petrel (PG-2) deployed a landing party of 40 marines on the shores of Cebu. Cebu&#x27;s transfer to the American government was signed by Luis Flores although others, most notably General Arcadio Maxilom and Juan Climaco, offered resistance until 1901. Governor W. H. Taft visited Cebu on April 17, 1901, and appointed Julio Llorente as the first provincial governor. Juan Climaco was elected to that office in January 1904.

====Cityhood====

With its city status granted by the King of Spain in 1594 invalidated by the change of colonial administration, in 1934 the neighboring municipalities of El Pardo, Mabolo, Talamban, Banilad, and San Nicolas were dissolved and merged to become the revived City of Cebu, which received its renewed official Charter on February 24, 1937. These former towns were broken up into several barangays, including their town centers which assumed their names (in contrast, Manila and Iloilo preserved their incorporated towns as geo-political districts) resulting this in expansion of its territory. Many other Philippine cities such as Dansalan (now Marawi), Iloilo City, and Bacolod were also incorporated at the same time (see Cities of the Philippines). Alfredo V. Jacinto was then serving as mayor when the city&#x27;s status was restored by law.

====Japanese occupation====
Along with the rest of the country, Cebu came under Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II. The Japanese encountered opposition from guerrillas and irregular forces led by Col. James Cushing and the Cebu Area Command. A Japanese businessman established Cebu&#x27;s first &quot;comfort station&quot; during the war, where Japanese soldiers routinely gang-raped, humiliated, and murdered kidnapped girls and teenagers who they forced into sexual slavery under the brutal &quot;comfort women&quot; system. It was finally liberated with the Battle for Cebu City in March and April 1945. The military general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 8th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary, active from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, was stationed in Cebu City during World War II.

===Post-war years===
The war virtually razed Cebu City to the ground. Reconstruction, however, was rapid. The city&#x27;s central business district, which had been confined largely to the coast and the area around the port before the war, had expanded inland. Colon Street, the oldest national road in the Philippines, which was once a residential area in the pre-war years, became the center of a dense and compact area in downtown Cebu City, becoming home to many shopping and business activities, including the city&#x27;s most fashionable shops, restaurants, and movie houses. In 1962, construction of the Cebu City North Reclamation Area commenced, finishing eventually in 1969, which expanded the port of Cebu and provided the city with more developable land close to the city center. During this time, Cebu also became a prominent educational center for the Visayas and Mindanao regions, and new schools were established in Cebu&#x27;s uptown areas, such as the Talamban campus of the University of San Carlos.

===During the Marcos dictatorship===

Cebu became a key center of resistance against the Marcos dictatorship, first becoming apparent when the hastily put-together lineup of Pusyon Bisaya defeated the entire slate of Marcos&#x27; Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL) in Region VII.

Among the Cebuanos immediately arrested by the Marcos dictatorship when Martial law was announced on September 23, 1972, were columnist and future National Artist Resil Mojares and human rights lawyer and Carcar Vice Mayor Democrito Barcenas, who were both detained at Camp Sergio Osmeña.

One of the Marcos Martial Law desaparecidos from Cebu was Redemptorist priest Fr. Rudy Romano, a prominent Marcos critic and executive secretary of Cebu&#x27;s Coalition against People&#x27;s Persecution, who was accosted by armed men in Tisa, Labangon, Cebu City, on June 11, 1985, and never seen again. Levi Ybañez, Romano&#x27;s colleague in the Coalition against People&#x27;s Persecution, was abducted on the same day as Fr. Romano, and was also never heard from again.

Later, Cebu would play a key role in the days leading up to the 1986 People Power revolution and the ouster of Marcos. It was from Fuente Osmeña circle in Cebu City that the opposition forces relaunched a civil disobedience campaign against the Marcos regime and its cronies on February 22, 1986. After that, the Carmelite Monastery in Barangay Mabolo, Cebu City, served as a refuge for opposition candidates Aquino and Laurel during the first day of the People Power revolution, because it was not yet safe to go back to Manila.

===Economic boom and contemporary history===
In 1990, Typhoon Ruping (international name &quot;Mike&quot;) hit Visayas and Cebu in particular, causing considerable damage to the infrastructure of the city and province. The typhoon cut off many of the city&#x27;s communication lines, and was virtually cut from the outside, causing delays for aid from the national government in Manila. This forced local authorities to rethink governmental priorities, and enforced some radical measures, such as food, water, and fuel rations. However, the city quickly recovered, and by the end of the decade, it was experiencing rapid economic growth, dubbed Ceboom. The economic growth of the city also spread economic growth to its neighboring cities and municipalities, which spreads from Danao from the north all the way to Carcar to the south.

Within the city, economic growth was observed in other areas as well, and much of the business activity shifted from the old and derelict downtown area to the more modern and more diverse business districts located in other areas of the city, including areas around Fuente Osmeña (colloquially known as &quot;Uptown Cebu&quot;), the Cebu Business Park, and the Cebu IT Park, among other areas. The opening of the aforementioned Ayala Mall and SM City Cebu had also shifted significant retail activities away from Colon, though it remained to serve as an important transit point for public utility jeepneys (PUJ) covering arterial routes within the city.

In 2002, the South Road Properties (SRP) was completed, initially with the intention of being a hub for light industries but gradually shifted to be a hub for mixed-use developments. The Cebu South Coastal Road, which traverses through SRP, has helped alleviate the city&#x27;s traffic by serving as an alternative to the Natalio Bacalso Avenue. SM Seaside City Cebu opened in 2015, and was one of the largest shopping malls in the Philippines upon opening. The opening of the Cebu–Cordova Link Expressway in 2022, which links the city to Cordova in Mactan, is poised to unlock the SRP&#x27;s potential as the city&#x27;s next economic hub. Other infrastructure projects, such as the Metro Cebu Expressway and the Cebu Bus Rapid Transit System, are also in place to help facilitate the city&#x27;s future growth.

The term Ceboom, a portmanteau of &quot;Cebu&quot; and &quot;boom&quot;, has been used to refer to the rapid economic development of both Cebu City and Cebu Province from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Cebu City is considered to be the prime trading center of the southern Philippines.

With Cebu City&#x27;s proximity to many islands, beaches, hotel and resorts, diving locations, and heritage sites, high domestic and foreign tourist arrivals have fueled the city&#x27;s tourism industry. Due to its geographic location in the middle of the country, accessibility by air, land and sea transportation, Cebu City has become the tourist gateway to central and southern Philippines. Its port, Port of Cebu, is the country&#x27;s second largest seaport.

The city is a major hub for the business process outsourcing industry of the Philippines. In 2013, Cebu ranked 8th worldwide in the &quot;Top 100 BPO Destinations Report&quot; by global advisory firm Tholons. In 2012, the growth in IT-BPO revenues in Cebu grew 26.9 percent at $484 million, while nationally, the industry grew 18.2 percent at $13 billion.

Aboitiz Equity Ventures, formerly known as Cebu Pan Asian Holdings, is the first holding company from Cebu City publicly listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange. Ayala Corporation, through its subsidiary Cebu Holdings, Inc. and Cebu Property, both publicly in the PSE Index, developed the Cebu Park District where the mixed-used development zones of the Cebu Business Park and Cebu IT Park are located. Both master planned areas are host to regional headquarters for various companies in the banking, finance, IT and tourism sectors among others.

Shipbuilding companies in Cebu have manufactured bulk carriers of up to deadweight (DWT) and double-hulled fast craft as well. This industry made the Philippines the 4th largest shipbuilding country in the world.

With a revenue growth rate of 18.8 percent in 2012, the real estate industry is the fastest growing sector in Cebu. With the strong economic indicators and high investors&#x27; confidence level, more condominium projects and hypermarkets are being developed in the locality.
List of largest shopping malls in the Philippines

Colon Street, the oldest national road in the Philippines, as well as its neighboring streets and surrounding areas, collectively known as Downtown Cebu, is an important center of commerce for the city. It is home to many malls, stores, and stalls selling various goods and services. Carbon Market is the city&#x27;s oldest and largest farmer&#x27;s market, and is set to be redeveloped to include other lifestyle and mixed-use developments. The redevelopment is scheduled to be finished by 2025.

===Shopping===

Cebu City, and Metro Cebu as a whole, is one of the Philippines&#x27; major shopping destinations. The Gaisano family, which operates Gaisano Capital, Gaisano Grand Malls, Gaisano Malls, and the Metro Retail Stores Group, traces its roots to the city.

There are four major super-regional malls in the city. SM City Cebu, located in the North Reclamation Area, opened in 1993, and is the first SM Supermall in the Philippines located outside Metro Manila. Ayala Center Cebu, opened in 1994, is a shopping mall at the Cebu Business Park. More than 85,000 people visit the mall every day, with the figure increasing to 135,000 daily on weekends. SM Seaside, opened in November 2015, is located in the South Road Properties and is one of the largest shopping malls in the Philippines. Robinsons Galleria Cebu opened in December 2015 and is in close proximity to the Port of Cebu. Other notable retail establishments include Ayala Malls Central Bloc in Cebu IT Park, Il Corso, Gaisano Mall of Cebu, and Gaisano Country Mall, among others.

==Government==
Being a highly urbanized city, Cebu City (along with neighboring Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu) is independent from Cebu province. Its electorate do not vote for provincial officials. There were proposals during the time of Governor Emilio Mario Osmeña to establish an &quot;administrative district&quot; that would be independent from Cebu City. This would mean carving out Cebu City&#x27;s Capitol Site barangay, where the provincial capitol and other provincial offices are located. The plan, however, did not go through and was even followed by other proposals like the transfer of the capital to Balamban.

Cebu City is governed by a mayor, vice mayor and sixteen councilors (eight representing the north and eight representing the south districts). Each official is popularly elected to serve for a three-year term. The chief of the Association of Barangay Captains and the president of the Sangguniang Kabataan Federation also serve in the city council. The day-to-day administration of the city is handled by a city administrator.

==Culture==

Cebu City is a significant cultural center in the Philippines. The imprint of Spanish and Roman Catholic culture is evident. The city&#x27;s most famous landmark is Magellan&#x27;s Cross. This cross, now housed in a chapel, is reputed to have been erected by Ferdinand Magellan (Fernão Magalhães) when he arrived in the Philippines in 1521. It was encased in hollow tindalo wood in 1835 upon the order of the Augustinian Bishop Santos Gómez Marañon to prevent devotees from taking it home chip by chip. The same bishop restored the present template or kiosk, located at Magallanes Street between the City Hall and Colegio del Santo Niño. Revered by Filipinos, the Magellan&#x27;s Cross is a symbol of Christianity in the Philippines.

A few steps away from Magellan&#x27;s Cross is the Basilica Minore del Santo Niño (Church of the Holy Child). This is an Augustinian church elevated to the rank of basilica in 1965 during the 400th anniversary celebrations of Christianity in the Philippines, held in Cebu. The church, which was the first to be established in the islands, is built of hewn stone and features the country&#x27;s oldest relic, the figure of the Santo Niño de Cebú (Holy Child of Cebu), who is Jesus Christ as a Child.

This religious and cultural event is celebrated during the island&#x27;s cultural festivities known as the Sinulog festival. Held every third Sunday of January, it celebrates the festival of the Santo Niño, who was formerly considered to be the patron saint of Cebu. (This patronage was later changed to that of Our Lady of Guadalupe after it was realized that the Santo Niño could not be a patron saint because he was an image of Christ and not a saint.) The Sinulog is a dance prayer ritual of pre-Hispanic indigenous origin. The dancer moves two steps forward and one step backward to the rhythmic sound of drums. This movement resembles somewhat the current (sulog) of the river. Thus, the Cebuanos called it Sinulog.

When the Spaniards arrived in Cebu, the Italian chronicler Antonio Pigafetta, sailing under convoy with the Magellan expedition, offered a baptismal gift to Hara Amihan, wife of Rajah Humabon. She was later named Juana, the figure of the Santo Niño. The natives also honored the Santo Niño de Cebú in their indigenous sinulog ritual. This ritual was preserved but limited to honoring the Santo Niño. Once the Santo Niño church was built in the 16th century, the Christianized-Austronesian natives started performing the sinulog ritual in front of the church, the devotees offering candles and indigenous dancers shouting &quot;Viva Pit Señor!&quot;

In the 1980s and 2000s, the city authorities of Cebu added the religious feast of Santo Niño de Cebú during the Sinulog Festival to its cultural event.

The city joined UNESCO&#x27;s Network of Creative Cities as a Design City on October 31, 2019, on the occasion of World Cities&#x27; Day. Cebu City was also recognized by the British Council as the Creative Capital of the Philippines. In 2019, it joined the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Design.

===Music===
Cebu City is regarded as the birthplace of BisRock, a term coined by Cebuano writer Januar E. Yap in 2002. Notable BisRock bands include Missing Filemon, Junior Kilat, Phylum, Rundown Genova, and Scrambled Eggs, among others. Popular Filipino bands Urbandub and Cueshé also hail from Cebu, but mostly sing their songs in English, and in the latter&#x27;s case, also in Tagalog.

The Cebu Reggae Festival is a popular Filipino Reggae and Roots music festival, it now has become one of the Philippines&#x27; largest annual Reggae Festivals.

Lifedance and Sinulog Invasion are rave music festivals held in the city in the days before the Sinulog Festival. These music festivals are regarded as among the biggest music festivals in the country.

The Cebu Pop Music Festival is an annual music festival, founded in 1980, showcasing Cebuano-language pop songs. Like Lifedance and Sinulog Invasion, the music festival is also held in the days before the Sinulog Festival.

On Cebuano musical heritage, the Jose R. Gullas Halad Museum in V. Gullas St. (former Manalili) corner D. Jakosalem St. in Cebu City, holds musical memorabilia of Cebuano composers in the early 20th century, the likes of Ben Zubiri (composer of Matud Nila), Inting Rubi (Kasadya Ning Taknaa) and Minggoy Lopez (Rosas Pandan).

Since 2013, Cebu has hosted the Visayan Pop Songwriting Campaign, an annual songwriting competition that aimed to showcase songs written in the Cebuano language. Founded by multi-awarded artist Jude Gitamondoc, Ian Zafra, Cattski Espina, and Missing Filemon&#x27;s front-man Lorenzo Niñal through the Artists and Musicians Marketing Cooperative (ArtistKo) with the support of the Filipino Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. Vispop, or sometimes Visayan pop, later on evolved from being associated with the music festival to a genre of the new wave of Visayan pop songs that gained nationwide popularity, even those songs that were not exclusively produced for or presented in the contest.

The city hosts the Museo Sugbo and Casa Gorordo Museum. The Cebu Taoist Temple is also situated within the city.

==Transportation==
Mactan–Cebu International Airport, located in Lapu-Lapu, is the country&#x27;s second-busiest airport and serves direct international flights and domestic destinations. Many international and cargo airlines fly to Cebu. There are also direct transfer flights via the capital&#x27;s Ninoy Aquino International Airport that readily connect the city to other destinations in the world.

The city is served by a domestic and international port which are handled by the Cebu Port Authority. Much of the city&#x27;s waterfront is actually occupied by the port with around of berthing space. The city is home to more than 80% of the country&#x27;s island vessels traveling on domestic routes mostly in the Visayas and Mindanao.

Transportation throughout the city and the metropolitan itself is provided by jeepneys, buses and taxis. The Cebu City Government conducted a 2012 feasibility study on implementing a bus rapid transit (BRT) system that will ease the transportation of the residents in the city and throughout the entire Metro Cebu area. Aimed to serve an estimated 330,000 passengers per day, the project would have a capacity of 176 buses running through 33 stations along Bulacao until Talamban with a link to South Road Properties. The project is currently branded as TransCebu and is expected to be fully operational by 2017. it was two years late, and the price had increased to ₱9.04B (US$180M).

Cebu UMRT, a mass transit system that uses rail lines, has been proposed in the JICA Study for both 2015 and 2019. The lines were included in the masterplan: a 67.5-kilometer Central Line as the first phase of the project is an underground railway that runs between Carcar City and Danao City, while the line will also traverse the areas of Cebu City; and a 25-kilometer Coastal Line from Talisay to Lapu-Lapu City, which will also traverse in the city.

==Infrastructure==
===Utilities===
The city mostly gets its power from an interconnection grid with the Leyte Geothermal Power Plant, which also powers the majority of the Visayas. Cebu is also powered by a coal-fired thermal plant with two units each generating 52.5-MW and 56.8-MW, a 43.8-MW diesel power plant and 55-MW land-based gas turbine plants located at the Naga power complex which is planned to be rehabilitated and replaced with 150-MW coal units by 2016 and to be completed by 2019.

Telecommunication facilities, broadband and wireless internet connections are available and are provided by some of the country&#x27;s largest telecommunication companies.

In 1998, the Inayawan Sanitary Landfill was constructed to ease garbage disposal within the city. After 15 years, the landfill reached its lifespan and the Talisay city government recently allowed Cebu to temporarily dump its garbage in its own landfill. In 2015, Cebu appropriated a total of ₱2.5M to close and rehabilitate the landfill at Inayawan.

<text>Castle Hill is a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, located 34 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district and 9.5 kilometres north of Parramatta. It is within the Hills District region, split between the local government areas of The Hills Shire and Hornsby Shire.

== History ==

=== Indigenous history ===

The land that is now called Castle Hill was originally home to the Bidjigal people, who are believed to be a clan of the Darug people, who occupied all the land to the immediate west of Sydney. The best-known Aboriginal person from that time is Pemulwuy, a Bidjigal leader who led the resistance movement against settlers during the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars, including sacking farms in Castle Hill, before his eventual capture and killing by bounty hunter Henry Hacking.

The Bidjigal people are today commemorated by Bidjigal Reserve which straddles the suburbs of Castle Hill, , North Rocks and West Pennant Hills.

===European settlement===
The first European visitors to the district were led by Governor Phillip in April 1791 accompanied by an entourage. Travelling from Parramatta reaching the &#x27;hills&#x27; following the Aboriginal trails, which today are overlaid by the Windsor and Old Northern Roads. As Governor he needed to find new country for settlement and farming land for crops so as to feed a struggling infant colony.

Governor King began Third Government Farm there on 8 July 1801, referring to it as &quot;Castle Hill&quot; on 1 March 1802. The majority of the convicts who worked the prison farm were Irish Catholics, many having been transported for seditious activity in 1798. They were branded &quot;politicals&quot; and exiled for life, never to return.

The first free settler in Castle Hill, a Frenchman Baron Verincourt de Clambe, in unusual circumstances received a grant of 200 acres (81 ha) in 1802. It has been suggested that locals of the time commonly referred to de Clambe&#x27;s house (&quot;The Hermitage&quot;) as &quot;The Castle&quot; because of the Baron&#x27;s noble status.

On Sunday night 4 March 1804, the convicts rose up as one in what was to become known as the Castle Hill convict rebellion, also known as the Second Battle of Vinegar Hill.

In later years, the area became filled with market gardens and orchards which supplied Sydney. As Sydney expanded, the orchards disappeared and were replaced with a sprawl of suburban dwellings, retail and commercial establishments and light industry. The Hills Shire Council commemorates the shire&#x27;s former role as an orange-growing area with the Orange Blossom Festival each year.

Castle Hill Post Office opened on 1 January 1869.

===20th century===
In the past Castle Hill was serviced by the Rogans Hill railway line to Parramatta to take the rural area&#x27;s produce to the city. However, it was closed in 1932, due to competition with buses, trucks and cars.

Local landmarks include:
* Castle Hill House (circa 1844) on Old Northern Road, which has a local-government heritage listing;
* The public school (1879), Old Northern Road, also with a LG heritage listing;
* The former parsonage (1866), Parsonage Road; 
* The former church, Old Northern Road, now converted to commercial use.

A notable part of Castle Hill&#x27;s cultural history was the period from the post-war period until 1968 in which Nobel laureate Patrick White and his partner Manoly Lascaris lived at 74 Showground Road in a house they named &quot;Dogwoods&quot;. For much of that period, they worked several hectares of farmland at the site. White wrote several of his most well-known novels while at Castle Hill; the suburb formed the basis of fictional settings for the novels &quot;The Tree of Man&quot;, &quot;The Solid Mandala&quot;, &quot;Riders in the Chariot&quot;, the collection of short stories &quot;The Burnt Ones&quot;, and the play &quot;The Season at Sarsaparilla&quot;. In his work, Castle Hill went variously by the names of &quot;Sarsaparilla&quot; and Durilgai&quot;. White based several characters on his experience of local individuals in Castle Hill at the time.

== Heritage listings ==
Castle Hill has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Gilbert Road: Third Government Farm
* 221 Old Northern Road: St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church, Castle Hill (former)

Its southern side is an older, traditional shopping strip, with the modest-sized &quot;Castle Mall&quot; shopping centre. Its northern side is dominated by the large Castle Towers shopping centre, with two department stores as well as two Event cinema multiplexes (giving a total of 16 Cinemas). A new library and community centre, with a unit apartment building on its upper floors, opened next to Castle Towers in 2004.

The main traffic road has been diverted through the nearby, Terminus Street.

Castle Hill is a mix of low to medium-density housing, with exception to a few apartment complexes. In 2005 year under the NSW Housing Strategy Hume Avenue was rezoned to medium density, to allow for low rise unit, and town house developments.

The largest residential area in Castle Hill is located at the two sides of Showground Road, sandwiched between the commercial and the industrial area. Smaller residential areas are located at the east of the commercial area, as well as the suburb&#x27;s north-east (part of Hornsby Shire, separated by Old Northern Road and Castle Hill Road). These consist almost entirely of free-standing houses. Several government and private schools, as well as an RSL Club, are located within these areas. To the north of Showground Road lies suburban, with approximately 1000 homes, the Samuel Gilbert Public School, Castle Glen Oval and the Knightsbridge Shopping Court. South of Showground Road, and to the east of Old Northern Road, lies the East Excelsior section of the suburb, known for its leafy streets, mature gardens and established homes on large land parcels, which is adjacent to Bidjigal Reserve. Managed by a community Trust, Bidjigal Reserve is about 186ha of bushland located within the Sydney suburbs of Castle Hill, West Pennant Hills, Beecroft, Cherrybrook, North Rocks and Baulkham Hills. There are many walking trails, and three marked tracks: Platypus loops along creeks from the entrance at Excelsior Ave; Burraga follows creeks and climbs Bald Hill from Platypus track, and the Murri Yanna begins at Aiken Road or Heidi Place and follows Darling Mills Creek to North Parramatta.

== Transport ==
The bulk of Castle Hill residents own private vehicles and travel to work using these, however bus services and the Sydney Metro Northwest run to the suburb.

Private vehicle use to travel to work either as a passenger or the driver was 34.6% as of the 2021 census, and 67.8% as of the 2016 census; in 2021 3.7% of people used public transport to travel to work compared to 17.6% in 2016; 6.1% of people were working at home in 2016 compared to 47.6% in 2021.

===Bus===

===Rail ===
Castle Hill is served by the Castle Hill and Hills Showground stations of the Metro North West &amp; Bankstown Line, which opened on 26 May 2019, connecting to via . With the Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest project under construction, service will continue to the Sydney central business district by 2024.

Between 1910 and 1932, Castle Hill was connected to by the Rogans Hill railway line, which opened as a steam tramway line, on 30 July 1910. Major works were undertaken in 1922 to convert the line into a railway, and trains began servicing Castle Hill on 28 January 1923. In 1924, the railway line was extended beyond its existing terminus to Rogans Hill. As a cost-cutting measure, the state Labor government of Jack Lang closed the line on 31 January 1932, amid much public protest.

Several proposals existed for another rail line to Castle Hill, resulting in the Sydney Metro Northwest beginning construction on 18 June 2014.

==Cultural activities==
The Hills Centre for the Performing Arts was a theatre and convention venue located on Showground Road, Castle Hill. Opened in late 1988 and under the ownership of The Hills Shire Council it was one of the largest venues of this type in New South Wales until it was demolished in 2013 to make way for the Sydney Metro Northwest.

Castle Hill Players put on six plays a year at the Pavilion Theatre in the grounds of the Castle Hill Showground. They have entertained at the Pavilion Theatre since 1966.

Castle Hill is home to storage for the Powerhouse Museum. The Museums Discovery Centre (MDC) is a collaboration between the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (MAAS), Australian Museum (AM) and Sydney Living Museums (SLM). The Museums Discovery Centre is an off-site visible storage and collection care facility, located on the corner of Windsor and Showground roads in Castle Hill. It has a unique and diverse collection of 400,000 objects spanning history, science, technology, design, industry, decorative arts, music, transport and space exploration. The MDC houses 40 per cent of the collection (by volume), or about 50,000 objects and is now open to the general public.

Access programs include themed supervised tours into stores on site; educational programs and workshops, tours for school groups and special-interest groups; school holiday programs; community engagement programs; regional partnership events; and specialist/industry and professional development programs. These provide insight not only to MAAS, AM and SLM Collections but to the important preservation undertaken there.

The Hills Craft Markets are open the fourth Sunday of each month, except January. A variety of arts and crafts and foods are offered for sale. Children can enjoy plaster painting, music, riding and playing in the showground.

In late March the annual Castle Hill Agricultural Show is held at the Castle Hill Showground. This show dates back to the 1880s and reflects the heritage of the Hills District. The show is mainly agricultural with many sheep, cattle and horse competitions on every year. The Castle Hill show also includes novelty games and items, showbags and educational stalls. The show runs for three days over the weekend (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).

== Notable residents ==
Notable current and former residents of the suburb include:
* Patrick White – Nobel Prize-winning novelist, playwright, poet, short-story writer, essayist and his partner Manoly Lascaris lived in Castle Hill for eighteen years after World War II
* Edmond Samuels – pharmacist, composer, author and his partner Joseph Smith lived in Castle Hill from 1950 until his death in 1973 
* Ray Warren – sports commentator, nicknamed &quot;Rabbits&quot; or &quot;Rabbs&quot;
* Christina Parie – 6th place on The X Factor Australia season 3 
* Georgia Garnett – AFL Women&#x27;s player
* Jonathon Webb – racing driver

<doc id="285879" wikidata="Q877784" url="?curid=285879" title="Truncated cuboctahedron">
<text>In geometry, the truncated cuboctahedron or great rhombicuboctahedron is an Archimedean solid, named by Kepler as a truncation of a cuboctahedron. It has 12 square faces, 8 regular hexagonal faces, 6 regular octagonal faces, 48 vertices, and 72 edges. Since each of its faces has point symmetry (equivalently, 180° rotational symmetry), the truncated cuboctahedron is a 9-zonohedron. The truncated cuboctahedron can tessellate with the octagonal prism.

==Names==
There is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron with a similar name: the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron.

==Cartesian coordinates==
The Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a truncated cuboctahedron having edge length 2 and centered at the origin are all the permutations of:
formula_1

==Area and volume==
The area &quot;A&quot; and the volume &quot;V&quot; of the truncated cuboctahedron of edge length &quot;a&quot; are:
:formula_2

== Dissection ==

The truncated cuboctahedron is the convex hull of a rhombicuboctahedron with cubes above its 12 squares on 2-fold symmetry axes. The rest of its space can be dissected into 6 square cupolas below the octagons, and 8 triangular cupolas below the hexagons.

A dissected truncated cuboctahedron can create a genus 5, 7, or 11 Stewart toroid by removing the central rhombicuboctahedron, and either the 6 square cupolas, the 8 triangular cupolas, or the 12 cubes respectively. Many other lower symmetry toroids can also be constructed by removing the central rhombicuboctahedron, and a subset of the other dissection components. For example, removing 4 of the triangular cupolas creates a genus 3 toroid; if these cupolas are appropriately chosen, then this toroid has tetrahedral symmetry.

==Uniform colorings==
There is only one uniform coloring of the faces of this polyhedron, one color for each face type.

A 2-uniform coloring, with tetrahedral symmetry, exists with alternately colored hexagons.

==Orthogonal projections==

The truncated cuboctahedron has two special orthogonal projections in the A2 and B2 Coxeter planes with [6] and [8] projective symmetry, and numerous [2] symmetries can be constructed from various projected planes relative to the polyhedron elements.
==Spherical tiling==
The truncated cuboctahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling, and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.
==Full octahedral group==

Like many other solids the truncated octahedron has full octahedral symmetry - but its relationship with the full octahedral group is closer than that: Its 48 vertices correspond to the elements of the group, and each face of its dual is a fundamental domain of the group.

The image on the right shows the 48 permutations in the group applied to an example object (namely the light JF compound on the left). The 24 light elements are rotations, and the dark ones are their reflections.

The edges of the solid correspond to the 9 reflections in the group:
* Those between octagons and squares correspond to the 3 reflections between opposite octagons.
* Hexagon edges correspond to the 6 reflections between opposite squares.
* (There are no reflections between opposite hexagons.)

The subgroups correspond to solids that share the respective vertices of the truncated octahedron.&lt;br&gt;
E.g. the 3 subgroups with 24 elements correspond to a nonuniform snub cube with chiral octahedral symmetry, a nonuniform rhombicuboctahedron with pyritohedral symmetry (the cantic snub octahedron) and a nonuniform truncated octahedron with full tetrahedral symmetry. The unique subgroup with 12 elements is the alternating group A4. It corresponds to a nonuniform icosahedron with chiral tetrahedral symmetry.

== Related polyhedra ==

The truncated cuboctahedron is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.

This polyhedron can be considered a member of a sequence of uniform patterns with vertex configuration (4.6.2&quot;p&quot;) and Coxeter-Dynkin diagram . For &quot;p&quot; &lt; 6, the members of the sequence are omnitruncated polyhedra (zonohedrons), shown below as spherical tilings. For &quot;p&quot; &lt; 6, they are tilings of the hyperbolic plane, starting with the truncated triheptagonal tiling.


It is first in a series of cantitruncated hypercubes:
== Truncated cuboctahedral graph ==

In the mathematical field of graph theory, a truncated cuboctahedral graph (or great rhombcuboctahedral graph) is the graph of vertices and edges of the truncated cuboctahedron, one of the Archimedean solids. It has 48 vertices and 72 edges, and is a zero-symmetric and cubic Archimedean graph.

<text>Newport County AFC () is a professional association football club in the city of Newport, South Wales. The team compete in , the fourth level of the English football league system. The club&#x27;s usual home colours are amber shirts and black shorts.

Formed in 1912, the club began life in the Southern League before being invited to become founder members of the Football League Third Division in 1920. They failed re-election in 1931, but were elected back into the Football League the next year. They struggled for the next few seasons, but went on to be crowned Third Division South champions in 1938–39. World War II meant they had to wait until the 1946–47 season to take their place in the Second Division, though they were relegated at the end of the campaign. They were relegated out of the Third Division in 1962. In the 1979–80 season, under manager Len Ashurst, they secured promotion out of the Fourth Division and won the Welsh Cup for the first time. They reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup the next year. In the 1980s they suffered financial difficulties with a double relegation costing them their Football League place in 1988 and the club went out of business in February 1989.

The club reformed but were initially unable to play at their home ground at Somerton Park, so picked up the nickname of the &quot;Exiles&quot;. They immediately won the Hellenic League in 1989–90 and were promoted out of the Southern League Midland Division in 1994–95. While playing at Newport Stadium, they were relegated from the Premier Division in 1997, before winning promotion out of the Midland Division again in 1998–99. Placed in the Conference South in 2004, they went on to be crowned champions in 2009–10 and after moving to Rodney Parade in 2012, they returned to the Football League following a 25-year absence after winning the Conference National play-off final in 2013 under manager Justin Edinburgh.

==History==
===1912–1988===
====Rise through the league====
Newport County, originally nicknamed The Ironsides due to Newport being home to Lysaght&#x27;s Orb Works steel works, started out in the Southern League in 1912 at Somerton Park. The official name of the club was The Newport &amp; Monmouthshire County Association Football Club, although the shorter &quot;Newport County&quot; was soon adopted. The club were reformed in 1919 and were first elected to the Football League in 1920. They were not re-elected after the 1930–31 season but rejoined for 1932–33. After almost 20 years in the Third Division South, the club finally clinched promotion to the Second Division as champions in 1939 under manager Billy McCandless.

====Second Division====
Hopes were high that the championship-winning side could prosper in the Second Division, but only three games were played of the 1939–40 season due to the outbreak of World War II. Newport County managed a 1–1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur and a 3–1 win over Southampton, finishing joint ninth out of 22 in the abandoned season. The War League operated for the remainder of the 1939–40 season and County finished 10th in the South-West Division.

After the war, the club reformed and competed in the temporary Football League South for the 1945–46 season. On the resumption of national league football for the 1946–47 season Newport resumed their place in the Second Division but the reshaped team suffered a host of defeats – including a joint Football League record 13–0 defeat at Newcastle United. Newcastle player Len Shackleton remarked &quot;they were lucky to get nil&quot;. Despite victories over Coventry City, Sheffield Wednesday and Fulham, the club needed four wins out of the last four games to have any hope of safety. Despite a revenge victory over Newcastle United, defeats to Birmingham City, Luton Town and Manchester City sealed their fate. County finished bottom of the Second Division and were relegated.

====Third Division====
Newport reached the fifth round of the 1948–49 FA Cup under manager Tom Bromilow, the furthest they have gone in the competition, later equalled in 2019. They only narrowly lost the game 3–2 away to Portsmouth, the eventual FA Cup semi-finalists and First Division champions that season.

After 11 further seasons in the Third Division South, the club narrowly avoided another effective relegation with the creation of the Fourth Division for the 1958–59 season. The bottom 12 teams from the Third Division North and South were placed in the new division, with the remainder forming the revived Third Division. County avoided this fate by a mere four points. However, in 1962, with only seven wins all season, the club were relegated to the Fourth Division – their home for the next 18 years.

====Fourth Division====
Billy Lucas had the first of three spells as Newport County manager from 1953 to 1961. County reached the fourth round of the 1956–57 FA Cup losing 2–0 to Arsenal in front of 20,000 spectators at Somerton Park. In the 1958–59 FA Cup County faced Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round. The game was played in heavy snow away at White Hart Lane, and although County lost 4–1 their goal came from an incredible 35-yard effort by defender Ken Hollyman. This made the score-line 1–2, giving County the hope that they could force an upset upon Bill Nicholson&#x27;s men (who were double winners a year later). However, two late goals for Tottenham ended County&#x27;s hopes of pulling off a shock result. County faced Tottenham again in the 1959–60 FA Cup third round at Somerton Park in front of a cup record 24,000 crowd, this time losing 4–0.

In January 1964 under Billy Lucas in his second spell as manager, County took on another high-profile side – Burnley, the 1960 Division One champions and 1962 double runners-up – in the FA Cup fourth round, but again suffered defeat 2–1.

In the 1970–71 season the Newport team managed by Bobby Ferguson set an unwanted Football League record by not winning any of their first 25 matches, losing 21 in the process. In the same season Newport equalled the worst defeat of a Football League club by a non-league club when they lost 6–1 to Barnet in the FA Cup first round. Results improved in the following season under Billy Lucas in his third spell as manager and in the 1972–73 season Newport missed out on promotion only on goal average.

For the 1976–77 season the team managed by Jimmy Scoular changed their playing strip to light blue and white striped shirts, light blue shorts and white socks akin to the Argentina national team in an attempt to turn around their fortunes. However, the team continued to struggle until Colin Addison took over in January 1977. The season became known as &quot;the great escape&quot; as County avoided relegation with a 1–0 win at home to Workington in the last game of the season.

====Promotion, cup &#x27;glory&#x27; and European run====

The 1980s heralded both the brightest and darkest moments in Newport County&#x27;s history. Len Ashurst was manager from 1978 to 1982, the club&#x27;s most successful period in its history and under the chairmanship of Richard Ford. In the 1978–79 FA Cup County beat West Ham United 2–1 in round three before losing 1–0 to Colchester United in a fourth round replay. In 1980, promotion was finally achieved from the Football League Fourth Division, the club being only five points from being crowned champions although never being in contention to win the league and never being top. County sealed promotion in the last match of the season with a 4–2 win at high-flying Walsall. Walsall finished second in the league and were also promoted.

The team included a young John Aldridge who later became one of the most prolific goal-scorers in English football history, most famous for helping Liverpool win the First Division title in 1988 and FA Cup in 1989, as well as helping Oxford United win two successive promotions and the Football League Cup.
Also in the promotion-winning team was Tommy Tynan, one of the leading lower-league strikers of his era, who scored the all-important goal that sealed County&#x27;s promotion. Dave Gwyther completed the trio of prolific goalscorers whilst captain Keith Oakes provided strength in central defence. Youth team products Steve Lowndes and Nigel Vaughan went on to attain international caps for Wales. This was also the year that County won the Welsh Cup, entitling them to play in the 1980–81 season European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

The 1980–81 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup turned out to be quite eventful – the first round against Crusaders of Northern Ireland was won 4–0 on aggregate (4–0 at home and 0–0 away). The second round against SK Haugar of Norway was even more convincing: after a 0–0 draw away, the home leg was won 6–0, taking the club into the quarter-finals against Carl Zeiss Jena F.C. of East Germany. Aldridge was injured for both matches against Carl Zeiss Jena, though he was a non-playing substitute in the 2nd leg. The quarter-final away leg was drawn 2–2 with Tommy Tynan scoring both goals, including his equaliser in the 90th minute. However, despite dominating the home leg, Newport lost 1–0 in front of 18,000 fans at Somerton Park, denying them a high-profile semi-final with S.L. Benfica. Carl Zeiss Jena went on to be the eventual cup runners-up, losing the final to Dinamo Tbilisi of the Soviet Union.

The Newport County squad for the first leg was: 1 Gary Plumley, 2 Richard Walden, 3 John Relish, 4 Grant Davies, 5 Keith Oakes (Captain), 6 Tommy Tynan, 7 Nigel Vaughan, 8 Steve Lowndes, 9 Dave Gwyther, 10 Karl Elsey, 11 Kevin Moore, 12 Neil Bailey, 13 Steve Warriner, 14 Dave Bruton, 15 Bobby Ward, 16 Mark Kendall.

In the 1982–83 season Colin Addison, in his second spell as manager, led Newport County to their highest post-war league finish – 4th in the Third Division, just four points behind third-placed Huddersfield Town. Huddersfield were promoted to the Second Division, along with champions Portsmouth and local rivals Cardiff City. County had actually gone top of the table in early April after a 1–0 win over Cardiff in front of 16,052 fans at Somerton Park, but a return of only four points from the last seven games meant County missed out on promotion. County faced First-Division team Everton in the third round of the 1982–83 FA Cup. After a 1–1 draw at Newport, Everton won the replay 2–1.

In 1986 County reached the FA Cup third round under manager Bobby Smith, losing 2–0 to Sunderland. Newport appeared in the Welsh Cup final again in 1987 under manager John Lewis, this time losing 1–0 to Merthyr Tydfil after a replay.

====Freefall and bankruptcy====
Despite reaching the Welsh Cup final, County were relegated from the Third Division in 1987 and in 1988 finished bottom of the Fourth Division with a mere 25 points, meaning that their 60-season stay in the Football League was over. They failed to finish their first season in the Conference and finally went out of business on 27 February 1989 with debts of £330,000. They were then expelled from the Conference for failing to fulfil their fixtures. Their record (four wins, seven draws and 19 points from 29 games) was expunged.

The BBC Wales current affairs programme &quot;Week in Week Out&quot; broadcast a documentary in 1989 about the winding up of Newport County and its controversial owner at the time, American Jerry Sherman.

===1989 onwards===

====Reformation and exile====
In June 1989 the club was reformed by 400 supporters, including David Hando as chairman and, later, club president. Former manager John Relish was re-appointed team manager and they were elected to the Hellenic League (then four divisions below the Football League). The club&#x27;s main aim was to regain the Football League status lost in 1988. The club took on the name &quot;Newport A.F.C.&quot; and adopted the nickname The Exiles, as a result of having to play home matches for the 1989–90 season at the London Road ground in the north Gloucestershire town of Moreton-in-Marsh, north-east of Newport. Newport Council considered the new company to be a continuation of the old, and refused it permission to use Somerton Park on the grounds of unpaid rent.

Newport won the Hellenic double, gaining promotion to the Southern League. After the 1990–91 and 1991–92 seasons back home in Newport at Somerton Park, the Football Association of Wales (FAW) consigned them to a further two seasons of exile in England, ground-sharing at Gloucester City&#x27;s Meadow Park stadium for 1992–93 and 1993–94. The club was forced to resort to legal action to protect themselves from being forced out of the English football league system by FAW secretary Alun Evans, who was promoting the first national League of Wales formed for the 1992–93 season. That litigation proved successful, with a landmark High Court verdict enabling them to have a permanent home in Newport at the then newly built Newport Stadium.

The club&#x27;s first season back in Newport, in 1994–95 under manager Graham Rogers, saw them promoted to the Southern League Premier Division, after winning the Midland Division Championship by a 14-point margin. On the way to that championship, the club set a then record for the Southern League by winning 14 successive league matches.

====Further progress====
In 1999, the club reintroduced the name Newport County A.F.C.

In the 2001–02 season the team managed by Tim Harris reached the first round proper of the FA Cup for the first time since the club was reformed, drawing Second Division side Blackpool. Holding them to a 2–2 draw away, County lost the home replay 4–1 after extra time. The following season, then managed by Peter Nicholas, Newport reached the final of the FAW Premier Cup beating Swansea City and Cardiff City along the way before losing 6–1 in the final against Wrexham.

====Conference South====
Subsequent reorganisation of the upper divisions of non-league football saw County take their place in the 2004–05 inaugural season of Conference South, one of the two feeder divisions into the Football Conference. Peter Beadle was appointed manager in October 2005 and in the 2006–07 season Newport again reached the first round proper of the FA Cup but lost 3–1 to Swansea City. In the same season, Newport reached the final of the FAW Premier Cup for the second time, beating Wrexham along the way but losing 1–0 to TNS in the final. In 2006–07 Newport finished just one position below the playoffs after losing 2–1 to Cambridge City on the final day of the season.

In the 2007–08 season, Newport won the last-ever FAW Premier Cup beating Llanelli 1–0 in the final, making a total of one win out of three finals. For the second consecutive season a last-day defeat prevented County reaching the Conference South playoffs. In April 2008 Peter Beadle was sacked as club manager, and was replaced by Dean Holdsworth.

In his first full season in charge, Holdsworth led Newport to a 10th-place finish in the league, despite a poor start.
Newport went top of the league in September of the 2009–10 season and held onto the top spot for the rest of the season. The league title was won in March 2010 after beating Havant and Waterlooville 2–0 at Newport Stadium with seven league games remaining. The win made them the first team in the English football leagues to achieve promotion in the 2009–10 season. County finished the season with a Conference South record 103 points, 28 ahead of nearest rivals Dover Athletic. Craig Reid was the league&#x27;s top scorer with 24 goals in the season.

====Conference Premier====
Newport County were promoted to the Conference Premier for the 2010–11 season, the level they had played at prior to bankruptcy in 1989. Dean Holdsworth left Newport County to become team manager of League Two club Aldershot Town on 12 January 2011 with Newport County in fifth place in the Conference Premier table. Tottenham Hotspur reserve-team coach Anthony Hudson was announced as the new manager on 1 April 2011. The team finished their first season back in the Conference Premier league in ninth place.

After a poor start to the 2011–12 season with the team last-but-one in the table after picking up just a single win out of the first 12 games, Hudson was sacked on 28 September 2011. He was replaced on 4 October 2011 by Justin Edinburgh with the task of saving County from relegation. Under Edinburgh, County finished in 19th place and so maintained their Conference Premier status. They also reached the 2012 FA Trophy Final and their first Wembley Stadium appearance coincided with the 100th anniversary of the club. County lost the final 2–0 to York City who went on to secure promotion to the Football League a week later in a Wembley play-off match.
In May 2012, Newport County announced that they had agreed a deal to move to the city&#x27;s rugby stadium, Rodney Parade. In August 2012 EuroMillions lottery winner Les Scadding succeeded Chris Blight as club chairman. In February 2013 a further 10-year lease to play at Rodney Parade was signed.

The centenary 2012–13 season saw Newport County finish third in the Conference Premier league, reaching the play-offs for the first time. A 2–0 aggregate win over Grimsby Town in the two-legged play-off semi-final saw Newport County reach the 2013 Conference Premier play-off final at Wembley Stadium. The final versus Wrexham was the first Wembley final to feature two Welsh teams, and Newport County won 2–0 to return to the Football League after a 25-year absence with promotion to League Two.
County were awarded Freedom of the City of Newport on 17 August 2013 in recognition of this achievement.

====Return to League Two 2013====

On their return to the Football League in the 2013–14 season, Newport County finished a creditable 14th in League Two. On 7 February 2015, with Newport County in sixth place in League Two, it was confirmed that Justin Edinburgh had been appointed manager at Gillingham. Jimmy Dack stepped up from assistant manager at the club to caretaker manager and was later appointed manager until the end of the 2014–15 season. On 29 April, Dack stated he had been offered the manager&#x27;s job beyond the end of the season but he had decided he would move on after the final game. Newport finished the 2014–15 season in ninth place in League Two. Terry Butcher was appointed team manager on 30 April 2015. On 18 June 2015 Les Scadding resigned as Newport County chairman and director.

====Supporters Trust takeover 2015====
On 1 October 2015 Newport County Supporters&#x27; Trust took over ownership of the club with Tony Pring appointed interim chairman. Butcher was sacked on the same day, with Newport bottom of League Two after gaining just five points from the first 10 matches of the 2015–16 season. John Sheridan was appointed team manager on 2 October 2015 until the end of the 2015–16 season and results improved. Sheridan resigned on 13 January 2016 after just 14 league games to take up the manager&#x27;s job at Oldham Athletic. Assistant manager Warren Feeney was promoted to team manager on 15 January 2016. On 18 January 2016 County lost 2–1 to Championship team Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup; the first time Newport had reached the third round of the cup since 1986. A good start saw Feeney gain 21 points from his first 12 games but results then worsened. Newport finished the season in 22nd place in League Two, avoiding relegation.

Feeney and Todd were sacked by Newport on 28 September 2016 with Newport County bottom of League Two having gained just six points from their first nine matches of the 2016–17 season. First team coach Sean McCarthy and goalkeeping player/coach James Bittner were appointed joint caretaker managers. Effective from 10 October 2016 Graham Westley was appointed team manager with Dino Maamria his assistant and Mccarthy released by the club. On 9 March 2017 Westley and Maamria were sacked with Newport 11 points adrift at the bottom of League Two.

==== Progress under Michael Flynn 2017–2021 ====

Following the departure of Westley, first team coach Michael Flynn was appointed caretaker manager for the remaining 12 league matches of the 2016–17 season and Wayne Hatswell returned to the club as assistant manager. A remarkable recovery saw Newport avoid relegation, sealed by a final day of the season 2–1 victory at home against Notts County with centre half Mark O&#x27;Brien scoring the 89th-minute winner. The season became known as the second &quot;great escape&quot; in the club&#x27;s history.

On 9 May 2017 Flynn was appointed permanent team manager on a two-year contract. On 7 January 2018 a 2–1 home win over Championship club Leeds United in the FA Cup third round meant Newport progressed to the FA Cup fourth round for the first time since the 1978–79 FA Cup. In the following round, the club was drawn at home to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. On 27 January 2018 Newport achieved a creditable 1–1 draw to force a replay at Wembley Stadium.

==Kit manufacturers and sponsors==
==Ownership==

In 2015 following the sale of the club by majority shareholder Les Scadding, Newport County AFC Supporters Society Limited was established with guidance from the UK Government backed charity Supporters Direct. The Society is established as a trust with an elected board, yearly elections, regular AGMs, and fee-based supporter ownership.

As a Registered Society under the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014) the group acquired a majority shareholding in the football club&#x27;s trading body, Newport Association Football Club Limited.

The supporters trust members elected a board of between 6 and 12 Directors. The board established that it would aim to operate with 9 directors, with a mixed model of elected and co-opted (unelected) directors. Directors are elected to three-year terms. In 2017 Peter Madigan and Mark Crook were co-opted to serve as unelected directors.

In 2017 a leaked resignation letter by director Charlie Hopkins he made allegations against some serving directors which were disputed by the Trust Board.

In October 2023 Newport County Supporters Trust members voted in favour of selling a controlling interest 52% of shares in the club to former Swansea City chairman Huw Jenkins, subject to EFL approval. The supporters trust retained 27% of shares and other previous private investors retained 21%. The sale was confirmed as completed on 24 January 2024 

==Supporters==

Newport County draws its main support from the city of Newport but also from the wider surrounding historic Monmouthshire area, as reflected in the original club name of &quot;Newport &amp; Monmouth County A.F.C&quot;. The club&#x27;s supporters refer to themselves as the Amber Army, in reference to the traditional club colour, and the sporting colours more widely associated with Newport. The club operates the &#x27;ifollow&#x27; match day voice and video commentary service for supporters.

The supporters&#x27; unofficial anthem is &quot;Come on the County&quot;, written by Ken Buck and Eric Thomas. Originally released in 1973, it was re-recorded in 1999 and 2010. The 1999 release included the song &quot;Carl Zeiss Jena&quot; by Newport band Flyscreen, celebrating County&#x27;s 1981 European campaign. The 2010 release included reworkings of &quot;Come on the County&quot; by The Tenants Supermen, who are ardent County fans. For the 2012 FA Trophy final, singer-songwriter Tracey Curtis wrote and released the song &quot;A Hundred Years of Football (And We&#x27;re Off To Wembley)&quot;.

In the 1970s and 1980s comedian Frank Carson was appointed as a director and vice president in order to raise the profile of the club. Newport-based rappers Goldie Lookin&#x27; Chain are supporters of the club and were the team&#x27;s shirt sponsors for the 2004–05 season FAW Premier Cup matches

===Rivalries===

County fans consider their main rival to be South Wales rivals Cardiff City, however, the two sides have rarely met since the 1980s due to the league gap between them. Other rivals, to a lesser extent, include Welsh rivals Swansea City and Wrexham, as well as relatively local rivals Bristol Rovers, Cheltenham Town and Forest Green Rovers. A 2017 match against Swindon Town saw opposing fans clash before and after the game in Swindon town centre. Before a match at Rodney Parade in January 2020, Swindon fans were filmed throwing toilet paper and drinks containers outside a pub in Newport city centre.

During County&#x27;s days in the non-league pyramid, Merthyr Tydfil and Bath City were considered rivals. County also used to maintain a rivalry with Hereford United. However, the club went out of business in 2014 and a new club, Hereford FC was formed.

<text>The Volkskammer (, &quot;People&#x27;s Chamber&quot;) was the supreme power organ of East Germany. It was the only branch of government in the state, and per the principle of unified power, all state organs were subservient to it.

The Volkskammer was initially the lower house of a bicameral legislature. The upper house was the Chamber of States, or &quot;Länderkammer&quot;, but in 1952 the states of East Germany were dissolved, and the Chamber of States was abolished in 1958. Constitutionally, the Volkskammer was the highest organ of state power in the GDR, and both constitutions vested it with great lawmaking powers. All other branches of government, including the judiciary, were responsible to it. By 1960, the chamber appointed the State Council (the GDR&#x27;s collective head of state), the Council of Ministers (the GDR&#x27;s government), and the National Defence Council (the GDR&#x27;s collective military leadership).

In practice, however, it was a rubber stamp parliament that did little more than ratify decisions already made by the SED Politburo. By the 1970s and before the Peaceful Revolution, the Volkskammer only met two to four times a year.

==Membership==
In October 1949 the Volksrat (&quot;People&#x27;s Council&quot;), charged with drafting the Constitution of East Germany, proclaimed itself the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; and requested official recognition as a national legislature from the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. This was granted by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. The Volkskammer then convened with the Länderkammer to elect Wilhelm Pieck as the first President of East Germany and Otto Grotewohl as the first Prime Minister of East Germany.

From its founding in 1949 until the first competitive elections in March 1990, all members of the Volkskammer were elected via a single list from the National Front, a popular front/electoral alliance dominated by the SED. In addition, seats were also allocated to various organizations affiliated with the SED, such as the Free German Youth. Effectively, the SED held control over the composition of the Volkskammer. In any event, the minor parties in the National Front were largely subservient to the SED, and were required to accept the SED&#x27;s &quot;leading role&quot; as a condition of their continued existence.

The members of the People&#x27;s Chamber were elected in multi-member constituencies, with four to eight seats. To be elected, a candidate needed to receive half of the valid votes cast in their constituency. If, within a constituency, an insufficient number of candidates got the majority needed to fill all the seats, a second round was held within 90 days. If the number of candidates getting this majority exceeds the number of seats in the respective constituency, the order of the candidates on the election list decided who got to sit in the Volkskammer. Candidates who lost out on a seat because of this would become successor candidates who would fill casual vacancies which might occur during a legislative period.

Only one list of candidates appeared on a ballot paper; voters simply took the ballot paper and dropped it into the ballot box. Those who wanted to vote against the National Front list had to vote using a separate ballot box, without any secrecy. The table below shows an overview of the reported results of all parliamentary elections before 1990, with the resulting disposition of parliamentary seats.

In 1976, the Volkskammer moved into a specially constructed building on Marx-Engels-Platz (now Schloßplatz again), the Palace of the Republic (&quot;Palast der Republik&quot;). Prior to this, the Volkskammer met at in the Mitte district of Berlin.

Initially, voters in East Berlin could not take part in elections to the Volkskammer, in which they were represented by indirectly elected non-voting members, but in 1979 the electoral law was changed to provide for 66 directly elected deputies with full voting rights.


After the 1990 election, the disposition of the parties was as follows:

==Presidents of the People&#x27;s Chamber==
The president of the People&#x27;s Chamber was the third-highest state post in the GDR (after the chairman of the Council of Ministers and the chairman of the State Council) and was the &quot;ex officio&quot; vice president during the existence of the office of president. As such, on two occasions, the president of the People&#x27;s Chamber served as acting president for brief periods in 1949 and 1960. The last president of the People&#x27;s Chamber, Sabine Bergmann-Pohl, was also interim head of state during the last six months of East Germany&#x27;s existence due to the State Council having been abolished. 

The presidency of the People&#x27;s Chamber was held by a bloc party representative for most of that body&#x27;s existence to keep up the appearance that the GDR was led by a broad coalition. Only one SED member ever held the post.

<doc id="285885" wikidata="Q966952" url="?curid=285885" title="William Brown (admiral)">
<text>William Brown (also known in Spanish as Guillermo Brown or &quot;Almirante&quot; Brown) (22 June 1777 – 3 March 1857) was an Irish sailor, merchant, and naval commander who served in the Argentine Navy during the wars of the early 19th century. Brown&#x27;s successes in the Argentine War of Independence, the Cisplatine War, and the Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata earned the respect and appreciation of the Argentine people, and he is regarded as one of Argentina&#x27;s national heroes. The creator and first admiral of the country&#x27;s maritime forces, he is commonly known as the &quot;father of the Argentine Navy&quot;.

== Early life ==
Brown was born in Foxford, County Mayo, Ireland, on 22 June 1777. He emigrated with his father to Baltimore, Maryland in 1793. Probably, they went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A short time after their arrival, the friend who had invited them and offered them food and hospitality died of yellow fever. Several days later, William&#x27;s father also succumbed to the same disease.

One morning, while he was wandering along the banks of the Delaware River, he met the captain of a ship then moored in port. The captain inquired if he wanted employment and Brown agreed. The captain then and there engaged him as a cabin boy, thereby setting him on the naval promotion ladder, where he worked his way to the captaincy of a merchant vessel.

Comparatively little is known of Brown&#x27;s early life, and it has been suggested that he was illegitimate and took his mother&#x27;s surname and that his father&#x27;s surname was actually Gannon.

== Napoleonic Wars ==
After ten years at sea, where he developed his skills as a sailor and reached the rank of captain, he was press-ganged into a Royal Navy warship. British impressment of American sailors was one of the primary issues leading to the War of 1812.

During the Napoleonic Wars, Brown is said to have escaped the ship he was serving on, a galley, and scuttled the vessel. However, the French did not believe he had assisted them and imprisoned him in Lorient. On being transferred to Metz, he escaped, disguised in a French officer&#x27;s uniform. However, he was recaptured and imprisoned in the fortress of Verdun. In 1809 Brown escaped from there in the company of a British Army officer named Clutchwell and eventually reached German territory.

Returning to England, he renounced his maritime career and on 29 July 1809, he married Elizabeth Chitty in Kent. As he was a Catholic and she a Protestant, they agreed to raise their sons as Catholics and their daughters as Protestants. Brown left the same year for the Río de la Plata on board &quot;Belmond&quot; and set himself up as a merchant in Montevideo, Uruguay.

== Immigration to Argentina ==
Brown became part-owner of a ship called &quot;Eliza&quot;, trading between Montevideo and Buenos Aires. When &quot;Eliza&quot; met with disaster and ran aground, Brown carried his cargo inland and having disposed of it profitably, he next crossed the Andes to Chile. He had by now accumulated sufficient capital to enable him to purchase a schooner called &quot;Industria&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Industry&quot;) with which he opened a regular sailing-packet service between Uruguay and Argentina, the first such venture in South America. Then, the Spanish colonial government stepped in, sensing a threat to its mercantile interests.

== War with Spain ==

Spanish ships destroyed Brown&#x27;s schooner and took drastic steps to nullify Argentina&#x27;s attempts to defend its coasts against Spanish raiders. As a result of the incident, Argentina resolved to provide ships to protect her coasts and trade, with Brown being commissioned as a lieutenant-colonel at the service of the navy and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Argentine fleet. That was following the challenge of Benjamin Franklin Seavers, registered as a Canadian merchant shipman, who relinquished his challenge when Brown&#x27;s supposedly illegal press-ganging earlier in his career came to light, which is believed to have tipped the scales in his favour to lead the flotilla. Seavers was American-born. However, following the Embargo Act of 1807, like most other merchant shipmen, he became Canadian to avoid the double taxation imposed on international trade.

The River Plate presented new opportunities for captains of free enterprise. It was important to keep grain lines open to the north of the continent, and the Spanish stood in the way. Seavers was Brown&#x27;s second-in-command; he led the first attack on the Spanish naval force, opening the blockade and providing a path for the fleet to take to high water. Seavers was also the first casualty of the battle. The news of the death of his friend and comrade impelled Brown to launch a full attack on the Spanish as Argentine morale was low at the loss of this experienced officer so early in the engagement.

On 10 March 1814 the Hercules, joined by the Julieta, the Tortugas, the Fortunata and the felucca San Luis, faced the strong Spanish naval fleet commanded by Captain Jacinto de Romarate. The Spanish armada had six warships, brigs, gunboats and a land battery with four cannons. There was a fierce combat after which the Hercules was stranded. American-born officer Benjamin Franklin Seaver, commander of the Julieta, was killed in action. The Hercules defended herself until 12 March at 10 am. As a result of this combat Commander Elias Smith, Lieutenant Robert Stacy and forty-five sailors were killed by grapeshot. There were about fifty wounded, which imposed a heavy task for the surgeon Bernard Campbell. The flagship received no less than eighty-two cannon blows and was repaired in the war zone. Plumb plates were placed under the waterline and the hull was covered with leathers and tar. Henceforth it was nicknamed as &#x27;the Black Frigate&#x27;. Richard Baxter, an English-born officer, was appointed as the new commander. On 17 March 1814, Brown attacked the island Martín García together with the Julieta and the Zephir. The Hercules engaged in combat with the Spanish warships Esperanza and Carmen.

A land attack was organized and at that moment William Brown ordered the fife and the drum to play &quot;Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day in the Morning&quot;, which boosted the morale of the troops.

On 20 April 1814, Montevideo was blocked by Argentine forces. There were no other major engagements until 14 May, when combat started, but the sea conditions stopped a full attack.

Brown resolved to attack the formidable Spanish squadron with his ill-equipped flotilla of seven ships. On 8 March 1814, Brown took his ships to sea and within 48 hours, he was engaged in a furious battle. Land and sea forces saw action at Martín García island, a fortified island from Buenos Aires, known as &quot;the Gibraltar of the River Plate&quot;, which commanded the access to the rivers Paraná and Uruguay. Brown failed to win possession of the island, and his flagship, &quot;Hercules&quot;, was badly battered and ran aground. Argentine forces attacked by land and sea on 14 March and after a stiff contest, he succeeded in gaining possession of Martín García. The Spanish commander took his ships to Montevideo pursued by Brown whose naval forces were increased by the addition of three armed merchant vessels.

The Spanish blockading squadron was now blockaded itself by Brown and his fleet. Montevideo was threatened with starvation. Brown, pretending to retreat, drew the Spanish forces away on 14 May from the protection of the fort guns, and two days afterwards, an engagement took place in the course of which Brown&#x27;s leg was shattered by a cannonball. Undeterred, he continued to issue orders and direct operations while lying on the deck of &quot;Hercules&quot;. In a panic, the Spanish squadron sailed for shelter to port, but three of the ships were captured. As a direct result, the Río de la Plata was freed from Spanish control and Montevideo fell to the Argentines.
The battle continued for Brown well after Argentina claimed victory. Assisted by Hippolyte de Bouchard, he chased and harassed Spanish shipping not only in Argentine waters but also on the west coast of the Americas and throughout the Pacific, much to the consternation of the Argentine investors of his ships. Stranded on an island and exhausted from fever, news arrived that he was to be court-martialed on his return to Argentina. He returned to England, where he fought a legal and political battle, which he won with the support of his allies. He returned to Argentina and had &quot;Hercules&quot; gifted to him. William Brown took up farming and enjoyed 14 years of contented and happy family life.

== War with Brazil ==

Brown remained active. Uruguay had been a bone of contention between Spain and Portugal for three centuries and now played the same role in relations between Argentina and Brazil. On 14 December 1825, war broke out between Argentina and Brazil.

The Argentine authorities had neither an experienced admiral nor a fleet, with all their energies being deployed to land campaigns along the borders. The coast seemed invisible, and Brown had long campaigned for an operational fleet but was ignored and labelled a &quot;foreigner&quot; by most of his opposition, which had turned from the &quot;blue shirt&quot; of the union to the &quot;red shirt&quot; of the federation. Then his chance finally came.

He was once again coaxed from his retirement by the &quot;cap in hand&quot; opposition to save the port of Buenos Aires. Brown accepted his commission and with a team of caulkers, he started building and equipping a fleet, as best he could.

The Brazilians initiated operations by blockading Argentina, which, under Brown&#x27;s guidance, improvised a new naval squadron of which he took command. Before the battle, Brown said two of his most memorable quotes: &quot;Comrades: confidence in victory, discipline, and three hails to the motherland!&quot; and, a few minutes later, &quot;Open fire, the people are watching us!&quot; As a counter to the blockade of Argentina, he vigorously attacked the Brazilian coast, shattered Brazilian shipping and, at the hard-fought Battle of Juncal (24 February 1827), destroyed the entire opposing Brazilian squadron, with seven ships and eight 1-gun launches. He also took its commander prisoner. On 11 June 1826, the Battle of Los Pozos took place between the Argentine and Brazilian forces in view of Buenos Aires, Argentina having only eleven ships as opposed to Brazil&#x27;s thirty-one warships. Later, he fought in the Battle of Monte Santiago, and peace of a sort followed, with Brown acting as Argentine commissioner when the
Treaty of Montevideo was signed on 4 October 1827.

== War with Uruguay ==


Factional disputes within Uruguay led Argentine leader Juan Manuel de Rosas to support his friend, the deposed Uruguayan president Manuel Oribe, in the civil war between the &quot;Blancos&quot; (supporting Oribe) and the &quot;Colorados&quot;. Brown returned to active service and defeated his former officer John Coe in three engagements near Montevideo. On 15 August 1842, he fought a battle on the River Paraná, defeating a Uruguayan riverine fleet of launches commanded by the future hero of the Italian &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, Giuseppe Garibaldi. After pursuing the Uruguayan up the river, Brown forced a landing and his marines brought the Uruguayans to action.

Many men on both sides knew one another from previous engagements and a minority of Brown&#x27;s men, having gained the advantage, took personal vengeance on a prisoner, emasculating him. Brown became enraged and, tolerating no cowardice among his men, severely punished them using the infamous &quot;gauntlet&quot; technique. The men were stripped and walked between two lines of their comrades who beat them with rods, with some killed. Brown, refusing to accept the victory because of the dishonour brought upon the battle by his men, used his influence to have Garibaldi released from prison where he was awaiting trial and certain execution. Brown used a saying on such occasions when loyalties were in question: &quot;Even if to the devil the word is given, then it must be kept&quot;. Honour in the line of duty was important to him, and his services to his adopted country were seen in the favour of Garibaldi, who would years later name one of his grandchildren &quot;William&quot; after Brown. The Argentine/&quot;Blanco&quot; forces occupied most of Uruguay but could not capture Montevideo, which endured a nine-year siege beginning in February 1843. When access to Paraguay was blocked in 1845, the United Kingdom and France entered the conflict on the &quot;Colorado&quot; side.

== Last years ==

In 1847, Admiral Brown visited his native Foxford accompanied by his daughter.

After the fall of the Rosas regime, many naval officers found themselves discharged but not the Commander of the Navy. Brown remained honoured for his long and loyal service to the nation. Retiring to his villa, &quot;Casa Amarilla&quot; at Barracas, Brown was visited by Grenfell, his opponent in the Brazilian war, who remarked how ungrateful the Republic was to its good servants; the old Admiral replied: &quot;Mr Grenfell, it does not burden me to have been useful to the mother country of my children; I consider the honours and the wealth superfluous when six feet of earth are enough to rest so many difficulties and pains.&quot;

On 3 March 1857, he died and was buried with full military honours. The Argentine government issued a &quot;comuniqué&quot;: &quot;With a life of permanent service to the national wars that our homeland has fought since its independence, William Brown symbolized the naval glory of the Argentine Republic&quot;. During his burial, General Bartolomé Mitre famously said: &quot;Brown in his lifetime, standing on the quarterdeck of his ship, was worth a fleet to us&quot;. His grave is currently located in the Recoleta cemetery in Buenos Aires.

== Legacy ==

Commemorative stamps showing him were issued in 1957 and 2003 by the Irish government, and in 1891, 1935, 1957, 1977, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1985, 2007, 2014, by the Argentine government.

Since the mid-1980s, a replica of Brown&#x27;s sword has been worn by Admirals of the Argentine Navy. One such replica is on display in the National Maritime Museum of Ireland. The original is in the National Historical Museum of Argentina.

Statues and memorials of Brown&#x27;s battles are located in both Buenos Aires and Foxford, his birthplace in Ireland. A museum to his honour was opened in Foxford, located on Lower Main Street. In April–June 2006 the Irish Naval Service patrol boat travelled to Buenos Aires in the first-ever deployment of an Irish warship in the southern hemisphere, in order to participate in commemorations of the impending sesquicentenary of Brown&#x27;s death, and to bring back a statue of Brown to be displayed in Dublin. During the trip, LÉ &quot;Eithne&quot; made a stop in the city of Mar del Plata, where they visited &quot;Plazoleta Almirante Brown&quot; (Admiral Brown&#x27;s Square) and pay tribute to the Irish naval hero along with their colleagues of the Argentine Navy.

Bertie Ahern, the Irish &quot;Taoiseach&quot;, said on 27 September 2006 on the occasion of unveiling the new statue of Brown on Admiral Brown Way, Sir John Rogerson&#x27;s Quay, Dublin: &quot;Back in 2001, it was my honour to lay a wreath at the Admiral Brown monument in Buenos Aires and to unveil a plaque commemorating my visit there. I brought away with me a clear sense of just what a significant figure William Brown is in Argentine history as well as a real idea of just how strong the links are, past and present, between our two countries.&quot;

Located in &quot;Casa Amarilla&quot;, a replica of Brown&#x27;s house in &quot;La Boca&quot; neighbourhood, the Brownian National Institute (&quot;Instituto Nacional Browniano&quot;) was created in 1948 for &quot;research and study the nation&#x27;s maritime history and naval interests, and cooperate with both the Argentine and Irish governments in the investigation of William Brown&#x27;s life and military achievements&quot;. The centre is based in Buenos Aires, with branches throughout the country.

Also, a substantial number of Argentine warships and political entities have been named after him. Examples include:
* The of destroyers, a group of four German-designed military ships commissioned between 1983 and 1984 for the Argentine navy.
* , an Italian-built cruiser in service during World War II, whose design was similar to those of the .
* , a currently active destroyer.
* The Almirante Brown Antarctic Base, an Antarctic base located in Paradise Bay.
* In 1982 the Wolfe Tones composed and performed a tribute song titled &quot;Admiral William Brown&quot;.
* The Almirante Brown department in Chaco Province, in the country&#x27;s northern region.
* The Almirante Brown Partido in Buenos Aires Province, located at the south of the Gran Buenos Aires urban area.
* The Admiral William Brown National College, a high school located in Adrogué, Buenos Aires Province. .
* Four different football clubs: Club Atlético Almirante Brown located in the town of Arrecifes, Club Almirante Brown located in Isidro Casanova, Brown Athletic Club from Adrogué, and Puerto Madryn-based Guillermo Brown.
Since 25 November 2012, the winner of the rugby international between Argentina and Ireland has been awarded The Admiral Brown Cup (La Copa Almirante Brown). Ireland became the first team to win this after defeating Argentina 46 points to 24 points.

<doc id="285888" wikidata="Q3331855" url="?curid=285888" title="Mbuti mythology">
<text>Mbuti (Bambuti) mythology is the mythology of the African Mbuti (also known as Bambuti)

The most important god of the Bambuti pantheon is Khonvoum (also Khonuum, Kmvoum, Chorum), a god of the hunt who wields a bow made from two snakes that together appear to humans as a rainbow. After sunset every day, Khonvoum gathers fragments of the stars and throws them into the Sun to revitalize it for the next day. He occasionally contacts mortals through Gor (a thunder god who is also an elephant) or a chameleon (similar to the divine messenger used by Orish-nla of Yoruba mythology). Khonvoum created mankind from clay. Black people were made from black clay, white people came from white clay, and the Pygmies themselves came from red clay. He also creates the animals that are needed by hunters (Polygenism).

Arebati is a lunar deity and Sky Father. In some sources, he was said to have created humanity from clay, instead of Khonvoum.

Tore is a god of the forests who supplies animals to hunters. He is also a thunder god who appears as a storm and hides in rainbows. Most importantly, Tore appears as a leopard in the initiation rites. The first Pygmies stole fire from Tore; he chased them but could not catch them, and when he returned home, his mother had died. As punishment, he decreed that humans would also die, and he thus became the death god.

Negoogunogumbar is a child-eating giant. Obrigwabibikwa is a dwarf who can change himself into giant a reptile.

A Mbuti soul is called a megbe. When a man dies, his son places his mouth over his to draw in part of the &quot;megbe&quot;. Another part inhabits the man&#x27;s totem animal. If the son does not inhale the megbe or the totem animal is later killed, the megbe may escape into the forest, where it becomes a semi-visible being called a Lodi and lives forever with others like it.

<text>The Battle of the Philippine Sea was a major naval battle of World War II on 19–20 June 1944 that eliminated the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s ability to conduct large-scale carrier actions. It took place during the United States&#x27; amphibious reconquest of the Mariana Islands during the Pacific War. The battle was the last of five major &quot;carrier-versus-carrier&quot; engagements between American and Japanese naval forces, and pitted elements of the United States Navy&#x27;s Fifth Fleet against ships and aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s Mobile Fleet and nearby island garrisons. This was the largest carrier-to-carrier battle in history, involving 24 aircraft carriers, deploying roughly 1,350 carrier-based aircraft.

The aerial part of the battle was nicknamed the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot by American aviators for the severely disproportional loss ratio inflicted upon Japanese aircraft by American pilots and anti-aircraft gunners. During a debriefing after the first two air battles, a pilot from remarked &quot;Why, hell, it was just like an old-time turkey shoot down home!&quot; The outcome is generally attributed to a wealth of highly trained American pilots with superior tactics and numerical superiority, and new anti-aircraft ship defensive technology (including the top-secret anti-aircraft proximity fuze), versus the Japanese use of replacement pilots with not enough flight hours in training and little or no combat experience. Furthermore the Japanese defensive plans had been directly obtained by the Allies from the plane wreckage of the commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s Combined Fleet, Admiral Mineichi Koga, in March 1944.

During the course of the battle, American submarines torpedoed and sank two of the largest Japanese fleet carriers taking part in the battle. The American carriers launched a protracted strike, sinking one light carrier and damaging other ships, but most of the American aircraft returning to their carriers ran low on fuel as night fell. Eighty American planes were lost. Although at the time the battle appeared to be a missed opportunity to destroy the Japanese fleet, the Imperial Japanese Navy had lost the bulk of its carrier air strength and would never recover. This battle, along with the Battle of Leyte Gulf four months later, marked the end of Japanese aircraft carrier operations. The few surviving carriers remained mostly in port thereafter.

==Background==
===Japanese plan for a decisive battle===
From the very start of the conflict in December 1941, the Japanese war plan had been to inflict such severe and painful losses on the US military that its public would become war weary and the American government would be convinced to sue for peace and allow Japan to keep its conquests.

Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto had grown wary of this strategy, but he was killed in Operation Vengeance on 18 April 1943. The following day, Admiral Mineichi Koga succeeded Yamamoto as commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, and Koga wanted the Imperial Japanese Navy to engage the American fleet in the &quot;single decisive battle&quot; in early 1944. On 31 March 1944 Koga was killed when his aircraft (a Kawanishi H8K) flew into a typhoon and crashed. Koga&#x27;s chief of staff, Vice Admiral Shigeru Fukudome, was flying in an accompanying plane and carrying the Z Plan documents, and also crashed. Fukudome survived, but the Z Plan briefcase did not sink with the destroyed aircraft and was recovered by Filipino guerillas who over the next few weeks transported the documents to General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s Military Intelligence Service (MIS) in Brisbane, Australia. MIS forwarded the translated Z Plan to Admiral Chester Nimitz in Honolulu, and the Japanese plans were quickly dispatched to the fleet commanders in the Philippine Sea in June. A new commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, was appointed, and he finalized the Japanese plans known as Plan &quot;A-Go&quot; or Operation A-Go. Operation A-go did not change much from the Z Plan, so the U.S. Navy knew exactly what was going to happen during the upcoming naval battle. The plan was adopted in early June 1944. Within weeks, an opportunity arose to engage the American fleet now detected heading for Saipan.

The Japanese had some advantages they hoped would turn the battle in their favor. Though outnumbered in ships and aircraft, they planned to supplement their carrier airpower with land-based aircraft.

===Advantages for the Americans===
Meanwhile, IJN aircrew losses, suffered during earlier carrier battles at Coral Sea, Midway, and the long Solomon Islands campaign of 1942–43, had greatly weakened the Japanese Navy&#x27;s ability to project force with its carriers. Losses suffered in the Solomons drastically reduced the number of skilled carrier pilots available to fill the carrier air groups. It took nearly a year for the Japanese to reconstitute their groups following the Solomons campaign.

Japan no longer had enough oil tankers to transport the required volume of petroleum from the Dutch East Indies to Japanese refineries. Without adequate supplies of refined residual fuel oil, Japanese aircraft carriers refueled with unrefined Tarakan petroleum in June 1944. This undesalted petroleum damaged boiler tubes, and the unremoved naphtha fraction volatilized the fuel to form explosive atmospheres incompatible with aircraft carrier damage control procedures.

In early 1944 the U.S. fleet continued its advance in a steady progression across the islands of the central Pacific. While U.S. commanders, particularly Admiral Spruance, were concerned about the Japanese trying to attack U.S. transports and newly landed forces, the Japanese objective was actually to engage and defeat the Fast Carrier Task Force in a decisive battle.

==Initial stages==

On 12 June 1944 U.S. carriers made air strikes on the Marianas, convincing Admiral Soemu Toyoda that the U.S. was preparing to invade. This move came as a surprise; the Japanese had expected the next U.S. target to be farther to the south, either the Carolines or the Palaus, and had protected the Marianas with only 50 land-based aircraft. On 13–15 June, American carriers made additional airstrikes while surface forces bombarded the Marianas. On June 15, the first American troops went ashore on Saipan.

Since control of the Marianas would bring American strategic bombers within range of the Japanese home islands, the IJN decided it was time for the long-awaited &quot;Kantai Kessen&quot; (decisive battle). Toyoda immediately ordered a fleet-based counterattack, committing nearly all of the Japanese navy&#x27;s serviceable ships.

The main portions of the fleet rendezvoused on 16 June in the western part of the Philippine Sea and completed refueling on 17 June. Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa commanded this force from his newly commissioned flagship, . In addition to extensive command facilities, reinforced torpedo blisters and a large air group, &quot;Taihō&quot; was the first Japanese carrier with an armor-plated flight deck, designed to withstand bomb hits with minimal damage.

At 18:35 on 15 June the submarine sighted a Japanese carrier and battleship force coming out of San Bernardino Strait. An hour later spotted a battleship and cruiser force steaming up from the south, east of Mindanao. The submarines were under orders to report sightings before attempting to attack, so &quot;Flying Fish&quot; waited until nightfall, then surfaced to radio in its report. Fifth Fleet commander Spruance was convinced that a major battle was at hand. After consulting with Nimitz at Pacific Fleet Headquarters in Hawaii, he ordered Rear Admiral Marc Mitscher, commander of the Fast Carrier Task Force (Task Force 58), who had sent two carrier task groups north to intercept aircraft reinforcements from Japan, to reform and move west of Saipan into the Philippine Sea. TF 52&#x27;s battleships, cruisers and escort carrier groups were ordered to remain near Saipan to protect the invasion fleet and provide air support for the landings.

Shortly before midnight on 18 June Nimitz radioed Spruance that a Japanese vessel had broken radio silence. The message intercepted was an apparent dispatch from Ozawa to his land-based air forces on Guam. Radio direction-finding placed the sender approximately west-southwest of TF 58. Mitscher considered whether the radio messages were a Japanese deception, as the Japanese were known to send a single vessel off to break radio silence, to mislead their adversaries about the actual location of the main force.

Mitscher realized that there was a chance of a night surface encounter with Ozawa&#x27;s forces. Arleigh Burke, Mitscher&#x27;s chief of staff (a former destroyer squadron commander who had won several night battles in the Solomons), assumed that battle line commander Willis Lee would welcome the opportunity. But Lee strongly opposed such an encounter. Having personally experienced a confused night action off Guadalcanal, Lee was not enthusiastic about a night engagement with Japanese surface forces, believing that his crews were not adequately trained for it. Shortly after learning Lee&#x27;s opinion, Mitscher requested permission from Spruance to move TF 58 west during the night, to reach a launch position at dawn that would allow for a maximum aerial assault on the enemy force. Spruance considered for an hour, then refused Mitscher&#x27;s request. Mitscher&#x27;s staff was disappointed with Spruance&#x27;s decision. Burke later commented: &quot;We knew we were going to have hell slugged out of us in the morning. We knew we couldn&#x27;t reach them. We knew they could reach us.&quot;

Spruance&#x27;s decision was influenced by his orders from Nimitz, who had made it clear that the protection of the invasion fleet was the primary mission of TF 58. Spruance had concerns that the Japanese would attempt to draw his main fleet away from the Marianas with a diversionary force while slipping an attack force in to destroy the landing fleet. Locating and destroying the Japanese fleet was not his primary objective, and he was unwilling to allow the main strike force of the Pacific Fleet to be drawn westward, away from the amphibious forces. Mitscher accepted the decision without comment. Spruance&#x27;s decision in this matter, although subsequently criticized, was certainly justified; by this point in the war, it was well known that Japanese operational plans frequently relied on the use of decoys and diversionary forces. Spruance, as it turned out, was acting appropriately to the Japanese plans that called for a diversion to draw the fleet far away so there would be a great opportunity for land-based Japanese planes to also augment the carrier aircraft to attack Spruance&#x27;s fleet.

Before daybreak, Spruance suggested that if the daybreak searches revealed no targets, the bombers could be sent to crater the airfields on Rota and Guam. However, the fleet&#x27;s contact-fused bombs had been largely used up in the earlier strikes, and Mitscher was left with only the armor-piercing bombs needed to combat the Japanese fleet, so he informed Spruance he could not launch such strikes. As the morning broke, TF 58 launched search aircraft, combat air patrols (CAP) and anti-submarine patrols and then turned the fleet west to gain maneuvering room from the islands. The U.S. Navy had developed a sophisticated air control system, which vectored CAP fighters by radar to intercept enemy bombers well before they reached the fleet. Any attackers that got through the CAP would then face a &quot;gun line&quot; of screening battleships and cruisers that would put up devastating barrages of VT-fuzed anti-aircraft fire before the attackers reached the aircraft carriers.

==Battle==
===Early actions===
The Japanese had already launched their morning search patrols, using some of the 50 aircraft stationed on Guam, and at 05:50 one of these, a Mitsubishi A6M Zero, found TF-58. After radioing his sighting of U.S. ships, the bomb-carrying Zero attacked picket destroyer but was shot down by the destroyer .

Alerted, the Japanese began launching their Guam-based aircraft for an attack. These were spotted on radar by U.S. ships. A group of thirty Grumman F6F Hellcats were dispatched from to deal with the threat. The Hellcats arrived while aircraft were still launching from Orote Field. Minutes later, additional radar contacts were seen, which were later discovered to be the additional forces being sent north from the other islands. A battle broke out in which 35 Japanese aircraft were shot down for the loss of a single Hellcat. It was a pattern that would be repeated throughout the day. At 09:57 large numbers of Japanese aircraft were picked up approaching the fleet. Mitscher said to Burke, &quot;Get those fighters back from Guam.&quot; The call &quot;Hey, Rube!&quot; was sent out. The fleet held steady until 10:23, when Mitscher ordered TF 58 to turn into the wind on course east-southeast, and ordered all fighter aircraft aloft, deployed in several layers of CAP to await the Japanese. He then sent his bomber aircraft aloft to orbit open waters to the east rather than leaving them in a hangar deck full of aircraft vulnerable to a Japanese bomb attack.

===Japanese raids===

The recall had been ordered after several ships in TF 58 picked up radar contacts to the west around 10:00. This was the first of the raids from the Japanese carrier forces, with 68 aircraft. TF 58 started launching every fighter it could; by the time they were in the air the Japanese had closed to . However, the Japanese began circling to regroup their formations for the attack. This 10-minute delay proved critical, and the first group of Hellcats met the raid, still at , at 10:36. They were quickly joined by additional groups. Within minutes, 25 Japanese aircraft had been shot down, against the loss of only one U.S. aircraft.

The Japanese aircraft that survived were met by other fighters, and 16 more were shot down. Of the 27 aircraft which remained, some made attacks on the picket destroyers USS &quot;Yarnall&quot; and &quot;Stockham&quot; but caused no damage. Between three and six bombers broke through to Lee&#x27;s battleship group and attacked; one bomb hit the main deck of , killing or injuring over 50 men but failing to disable her. &quot;South Dakota&quot; was the only American ship damaged in this attack. No aircraft of Ozawa&#x27;s first wave got through to the American carriers.
At 11:07, radar detected another, larger attack. This second wave consisted of 107 aircraft. They were met while still out, and at least 70 of these aircraft were shot down before reaching the ships. Six attacked Rear Admiral Alfred E. Montgomery&#x27;s group, nearly hitting two of the carriers and causing casualties on each. Four of the six were shot down. A small group of torpedo aircraft attacked , with one torpedo exploding in the wake of the ship. Three other torpedo aircraft attacked the light carrier and were shot down. In all, 97 of the 107 attacking aircraft were destroyed.

A third raid, consisting of 47 aircraft, came in from the north. It was intercepted by 40 fighters at 13:00, while out from the task force. Seven Japanese aircraft were shot down. A few broke through and made an ineffective attack on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; group. Many others did not press home their attacks. This raid therefore suffered less than the others, and 40 of its aircraft managed to return to their carriers.

A fourth Japanese raid was launched between 11:00 and 11:30, but pilots had been given an incorrect position for the U.S. fleet and could not locate it. They broke into two loose groups and turned for Guam and Rota to refuel. One group flying toward Rota stumbled upon Montgomery&#x27;s task group. Eighteen aircraft joined battle with American fighters and lost half their number. A smaller group of nine Japanese dive bombers of this force evaded U.S. aircraft and attacked and &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; but scored no hits; eight were shot down. The larger group of Japanese aircraft had flown to Guam and were intercepted over Orote Field by 27 Hellcats while landing. Thirty of the forty-nine Japanese aircraft were shot down, and the rest were damaged beyond repair. Aboard the &quot;Lexington&quot; afterward, a pilot was heard to remark &quot;Hell, this is like an old-time turkey shoot!&quot;

Including the continued aerial slaughter over Orote Field, Japanese losses exceeded 350 planes on the first day of battle. About 30 American planes were lost, and there was little damage to American ships; even the damaged &quot;South Dakota&quot; was able to remain in formation to continue her anti-aircraft duties.

===Submarine attacks===
Throughout the day, American scout aircraft had been unable to locate the Japanese fleet. However, two American submarines had already spotted Ozawa&#x27;s carriers early that morning and were about to provide important assistance to the Fast Carrier Task Force.
At 08:16 the submarine , which had sighted Ozawa&#x27;s carrier group, had maneuvered into an ideal attack position; Lieutenant Commander James W. Blanchard selected the closest carrier as his target, which happened to be , the largest and newest carrier in the Japanese fleet and Ozawa&#x27;s flagship. As &quot;Albacore&quot; was about to fire, however, her fire-control computer failed, and the torpedoes had to be fired &quot;by eye&quot;. Determined to go ahead with the attack, Blanchard ordered all six torpedoes to be fired in a single spread to increase the chances of a hit.
&quot;Taihō&quot; had just launched 42 aircraft as a part of the second raid when &quot;Albacore&quot; fired the torpedo spread. Of the six torpedoes fired, four veered off-target. Japanese pilot Sakio Komatsu had recently launched and from his aircraft sighted one of the two torpedoes which were heading for &quot;Taihō&quot;. Komatsu dived into the path of the torpedo which then detonated. The sixth torpedo struck the carrier on her starboard side and ruptured two aviation fuel tanks. The carrier&#x27;s escorting destroyers made depth charge attacks but caused only minor damage to &quot;Albacore&quot;. Initially, the damage to &quot;Taihō&quot; seemed minor; the flooding was quickly contained and the carrier&#x27;s propulsion and navigation were unaffected. &quot;Taihō&quot; quickly resumed regular operations, but gasoline vapor from the ruptured fuel tanks began to fill the hangar decks, creating an increasingly dangerous situation on board.

Another submarine, , was able to maneuver to an attack position on the 25,675-ton carrier by about noon. The submarine fired a spread of six torpedoes, three of which struck &quot;Shōkaku&quot; on her starboard side. Badly damaged, the carrier came to a halt. One torpedo had hit the forward aviation fuel tanks near the main hangar, and aircraft that had just landed and were being refueled exploded into flames. Ammunition and exploding bombs added to the conflagration, as did burning fuel spewing from shattered fuel pipes. With her bows subsiding into the sea and fires out of control, the captain gave orders to abandon ship. Within minutes, there was a catastrophic explosion of aviation fuel vapor which had built up between decks, which blew the ship apart. The carrier rolled over and sank about north of the island of Yap. 887 crew and 376 men of the 601st Naval Air Group, 1,263 men in all, were killed. There were 570 survivors, including the carrier&#x27;s commanding officer, Captain Hiroshi Matsubara. Destroyer attacked the submarine, but &quot;Cavalla&quot; escaped with relatively minor damage despite near misses from depth charges.

Meanwhile, &quot;Taihō&quot; was falling victim to poor damage control. Hoping to clear the explosive fumes, an inexperienced damage-control officer ordered her ventilation system to operate at full blast. This action instead spread the vapors throughout &quot;Taihō&quot;, putting the entire vessel at risk. At approximately 14:30, a spark from an electric generator on the hangar deck ignited the accumulated fumes, triggering a series of catastrophic explosions. After the first explosions, it was clear that &quot;Taihō&quot; was doomed, and Ozawa and his staff transferred to the nearby destroyer . Soon thereafter, &quot;Taihō&quot; suffered a second series of explosions and sank. From a crew of 2,150, 1,650 officers and men were lost.

===U.S. counterattack===
TF 58 sailed west during the night to attack the Japanese at dawn. Search patrols were put up at first light.

Ozawa had transferred to the destroyer &quot;Wakatsuki&quot;, but the radio gear on board was incapable of sending the number of messages needed, so he transferred again, to the carrier , at 13:00. He then learned of the disastrous results of the previous day and that he had about 150 aircraft left. Nevertheless, he decided to continue the attacks, thinking there were still hundreds of aircraft on Guam and Rota and started planning new raids for 21 June.

The main problem for TF 58 was locating the enemy, who had been operating at a great distance. Early-morning American searches on 20 June found nothing. An extra mid-day search by Hellcat fighter pilots was also unsuccessful. Finally at 15:12 a garbled message from an &quot;Enterprise&quot; search plane indicated a sighting. At 15:40 the sighting was verified, along with distance, course, and speed. The Japanese fleet was out, moving due west at a speed of 20 knots. The Japanese were at the limit of TF 58&#x27;s strike range, and daylight was slipping away. Mitscher decided to launch an all-out strike. After the first attack group had launched, a third message arrived, indicating the Japanese fleet were farther out than previously indicated. The first launch would be at their limits of fuel and would have to attempt landing at night. Mitscher canceled the second launch of aircraft but chose not to recall the first launch. Of the 240 planes that were launched for the strike, 14 aborted for various reasons and returned to their ships. The 226 planes that continued consisted of 95 Hellcat fighters (some carrying 500-pound bombs), 54 Avenger torpedo bombers (only a few carrying torpedoes, the rest four 500-pound bombs) and 77 dive bombers (51 Helldivers and 26 Dauntlesses). The TF 58 aircraft arrived over the Japanese fleet just before sunset.

The 35 or so fighters Ozawa was able to put up were overwhelmed by the 226 incoming aircraft of Mitscher&#x27;s attack. While the few Japanese aircraft were often skillfully handled and the Japanese anti-aircraft fire was intense, the U.S. planes were able to press in on the attack.

The first ships sighted by the U.S. strike were oilers, before the carrier groups. The strike group from &quot;Wasp&quot;, more concerned with their low fuel levels than with finding the more important Japanese carriers and battleships, dived on the tankers. Two of these were damaged so severely that they were later scuttled, while a third was able to put out fires and get underway. The carrier was attacked and hit by bombs and aerial torpedoes from four Grumman TBF Avengers from &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;. &quot;Hiyō&quot; was set afire after a tremendous blast from leaking aviation fuel. Dead in the water, she sank stern first, with the loss of 250 officers and men. The rest of her crew, about one thousand, were rescued by Japanese destroyers.

The carriers &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, and were damaged by bombs. Returning American strike pilots generally assessed these carriers as more crippled than they actually were, mistaking for devastating direct hits what Japanese post-war records revealed to have actually been huge geysers caused by near misses. The battleship was also hit by two bombs, including one directly on a main battery turret. Damage was contained, and she was able to keep station because her captain promptly called to flood the turret&#x27;s magazine to avoid the possibility of an explosion.

Twenty American aircraft in the strike were destroyed by Japanese fighters and anti-aircraft fire that made up for a relative lack of accuracy with high volume of fire. After the protracted strike, it became clear that most of the aircraft returning to their carriers were running dangerously low on fuel, and to worsen matters, night had fallen. At 20:45, the first returning U.S. aircraft reached TF 58. Knowing his aviators would have difficulty finding their carriers, Admiral Joseph J. Clark of decided to illuminate his carrier, shining searchlights directly up into the night, despite the risk of attack from Japanese submarines and night-flying aircraft. Mitscher backed up the decision, and soon every ship in Task Force 58 was lit up, in spite of the risks involved. Picket destroyers fired starshells to help the aircraft find the task groups.

Planes were given clearance to land on any available flight deck (not just their home carriers, as usual), and many did land on other carriers. Despite this, 80 of the returning aircraft were lost. Some crashed on flight decks, but the majority ditched into the sea. Some pilots intentionally went down in groups to facilitate rescue, and more ditched individually either in a controlled landing with a few gallons of fuel left or in a crash after their engines ran dry. Approximately three-quarters of the crews were rescued from the sea, either that night from crash locations within the task forces, or over the next few days for those further out, as search planes and destroyers criss-crossed the ocean looking for them.

==Aftermath==

===Japanese===
That night, Toyoda ordered Ozawa to withdraw from the Philippine Sea. U.S. forces gave chase, but the battle was over. The four Japanese air strikes involved 373 carrier aircraft, of which 243 were lost and 130 returned to the carriers; many of them were subsequently lost when &quot;Taiho&quot; and &quot;Shōkaku&quot; were sunk. After the second day of the battle, losses totaled three carriers, more than 350 carrier aircraft, and around 200 land-based aircraft.

In the five major &quot;carrier-on-carrier&quot; battles, from the Battle of the Coral Sea to the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the IJN had lost nine carriers, while the USN had lost four. The aircraft and trained pilots lost at Philippine Sea were an irreplaceable blow to the already outnumbered Japanese fleet air arm. The Japanese had spent the better part of a year (following the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands) reconstituting their depleted carrier air groups, and the American Fast Carrier Task Force had destroyed 90% of it in two days. The Japanese had only enough pilots left to form the air group for one of their light carriers. As a consequence, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf four months later, they sent out a decoy carrier group with only 108 aircraft, across six carriers (two were hybrid-carriers), that was sacrificed in an attempt to draw the American fleet away from protecting the troops and supplies being landed for the Battle of Leyte.

The Japanese military, which had hidden the extent of their previous losses from the Japanese public, continued this policy. Though the occurrence of the simultaneous Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Saipan were made known to the public, the extent of the disasters was withheld.

===American===
Losses on the U.S. side on the first day were 23 aircraft. The second day&#x27;s airstrike against the Japanese fleet saw most of the aircraft losses for the U.S.; of the 226 aircraft launched on the strike, 115 returned; 20 were lost to enemy action in the attack, and 80 were lost when they ran out of fuel returning to their carriers and had to ditch into the sea, or crashed attempting to land at night.

Spruance&#x27;s conservative battle plan for TF 58, while sinking just one light carrier, severely weakened the Japanese naval aviation forces by killing most of the remaining trained pilots and destroying their operational reserves of naval aircraft, a blow that effectively shattered the Japanese naval air arm, from which it never recovered. Without the time or resources to build sufficient aircraft and train new pilots, the surviving Japanese carriers were almost useless in an offensive role, a fact the Japanese acknowledged by using them as sacrificial decoys at Leyte Gulf. With the effective crippling of her best striking arm, Japan chose to rely increasingly on land-based kamikaze suicide aircraft in a last-ditch effort to make the war so costly that the U.S. would offer peace terms better than unconditional surrender.

Spruance was heavily criticized after the battle by many officers, particularly the aviators, for his decision to fight the battle cautiously rather than exploiting his superior forces and intelligence data with a more aggressive posture. By failing to close on the enemy earlier and more forcefully, his critics argue, he squandered an opportunity to destroy the entire Japanese Mobile Fleet. &quot;This is what comes of placing a non-aviator in command over carriers&quot; was the common refrain. Admiral John Towers, a naval aviation pioneer and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Pacific Fleet, demanded that Spruance be relieved. The request was denied by Nimitz. Moreover, Spruance was supported in his decision by Admiral Kelly Turner and Admiral Ernest King, Chief of Naval Operations.

Spruance&#x27;s caution (in particular, his suspicion of a diversionary force) can be compared with Admiral William Halsey&#x27;s headlong pursuit of an actual diversionary force at Leyte Gulf four months later. Halsey left the American invasion fleet weakly protected during the Battle off Samar, nearly resulting in a devastating attack on the landing force by Japanese heavy surface units. It was prevented only by the heroic and desperate attack of 5 small American surface ships, which put up such an intense fight that the 23-ship-strong Japanese fleet thought they were engaging a much larger force and withdrew. In addition, by focusing on defense first, the carrier forces under Spruance at Philippine Sea suffered no significant harm. This was in contrast to Leyte Gulf when Halsey&#x27;s carriers were trying to neutralize the enemy airfields and attack the enemy fleet simultaneously, such that a Japanese bomber managed to evade the Combat Air Patrols to fatally cripple the light carrier USS &quot;Princeton&quot;. Likewise, during the carrier-based air raids, U.S. carriers were in a vulnerable position, and the low visibility coupled with radar confusion let a Japanese bomber slip through and severely damage .

Although the American carrier aircraft strikes caused less destruction to enemy naval vessels than earlier battles, American submarines made up for it by sinking two of the three Japanese fleet carriers, which left &quot;Zuikaku&quot; as the only remaining operational IJN fleet carrier.

The American F6F Hellcat fighter proved its worth, as its powerful engine generated superior speed, while its heavier armor and firepower made it rugged and deadly. The Japanese on the other hand were still flying the A6M Zero which, though highly maneuverable and revolutionary during the early stages of the Pacific War, was now underpowered, fragile and essentially obsolete by 1944. In addition, the D4Y &quot;Judy&quot;, though fast, was also fragile and easily set on fire. The Japanese naval airmen were also inadequately trained. The Japanese training programs could not replace the quality aviators lost during the past two years of the Pacific Campaign. Flying against the well-trained and often veteran U.S. aviators, it was a one-sided contest. The Americans lost fewer than two dozen Hellcats in air-to-air combat. Naval aviation and anti-aircraft fire shot down nearly 480 Japanese aircraft, 346 of those carrier aircraft on 19 June alone.

A very fortunate result of the Battle of the Philippine Sea for the Allies was it greatly benefited General MacArthur&#x27;s invasion of Biak in Dutch New Guinea which started weeks before the Mariana Islands operations started. The Japanese military had designated Biak as its most important island of defense in the Southwest Pacific theater. 13 June was the original starting date of a massive operation, spearheaded by the battleships and , to challenge MacArthur&#x27;s paltry naval forces, which had no aircraft carriers or battleships and consisted of only a few cruisers and destroyers. On that very same day &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot; and their supporting ships received new orders to head north to screen aircraft carriers that were about to begin Operation A-Go. The battleships didn&#x27;t take part in the Marianas operations other than anti-aircraft duty.

<doc id="285897" wikidata="Q2736787" url="?curid=285897" title="Epinephrine autoinjector">
<text>An epinephrine autoinjector (or adrenaline autoinjector, also known by the trademark EpiPen) is a medical device for injecting a measured dose or doses of epinephrine (adrenaline) by means of autoinjector technology. It is most often used for the treatment of anaphylaxis. The first epinephrine autoinjector was brought to market in 1983.
==Medical uses==
Epinephrine autoinjectors are hand-held devices carried by those who have severe allergies; the epinephrine delivered by the device is an emergency treatment for anaphylaxis.

When anaphylaxis is suspected, epinephrine solution should be given as soon as possible as an intramuscular injection, in the middle of the outer side of the thigh, which corresponds to the location of the vastus lateralis muscle. The injection may be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes if there is insufficient response. A second dose is needed in 16–35% of episodes with more than two doses rarely required; in around 80% of the cases where a second dose is administered, it is by a medical professional. It is not clear which are the people who might need a second injection at the outset. The intramuscular route is preferred over subcutaneous administration because the latter may have delayed absorption. Minor adverse effects from epinephrine include tremors, anxiety, headaches, and palpitations.

The epinephrine in autoinjectors expires after one year. A study in rabbits showed that intramuscular epinephrine has decreased effectiveness after it expires; that study also recommended that if the drug in an expired device has not started to precipitate (if the solution is not cloudy and has no particles in it) using the expired device is better than no injection at all in an emergency situation.

==Design==

The devices contain a fixed dose of epinephrine and a spring-loaded needle (or, in the case of AuviQ, a CO2-driven needle) that exits the tip or edge of the device and penetrates the recipient&#x27;s skin, to deliver the medication via intramuscular injection.

People to whom epinephrine autoinjectors are prescribed need to be trained how to use the specific device prescribed. The rate of unintentional injections using these devices is unknown but a 2009 review found that the rate is increasing. Unintentional injections are delivered to a finger or thumb around 90% of the time; they cause intense pain locally but usually completely resolve. The cause of unintentional injections has been attributed to design flaws, where the device is mistaken for a pen or the user mistakes which end of the device contains the needle.

The European Medicines Agency conducted a review of the safety of devices then on the market and found several factors that determine whether the devices successfully deliver drug into muscle, including &quot;needle length, the thickness of fat under the skin, the way the auto-injector works (e.g., if it is spring loaded or not), the angle at which the device is placed on the skin and the force used to activate the device as well as how well the user follows the instructions for injection.&quot; It found that how well the user was trained was the most important factor determining successful delivery, and requested companies to develop better training materials for doctors and people to whom the devices are prescribed.

In 2013, emergency physician Seth C. Hawkins and coauthors published a technique for obtaining multiple additional doses of epinephrine from used, single dose autoinjectors EpiPen and Adrenaclick. It was emphasized this was an emergency adaptation of the intended design for austere environments when no additional epinephrine was available. In 2016, Robinson and Lareau published a similar technique adapted to used AuviQ autoinjectors.

==History==
===Product introduction===
Autoinjectors were originally developed for the rapid administration of nerve gas antidotes in kits like the Mark I NAAK. The first modern epinephrine autoinjector, the EpiPen, was invented in the mid-1970s at Survival Technology in Bethesda, Maryland, US by Sheldon Kaplan and was first approved for marketing by the FDA in 1987.

One of the people who helped in making the EpiPen was Richard B. Toren. He had the idea to use this technology for allergic reactions because his daughter was allergic to bees and had to carry around a complex kit if she was ever stung. He then helped to slightly alter the technology in order to create EpiPen&#x27;s current design.

In 1996, Survival Technology merged with a company called Brunswick Biomedical and the new company was called Meridian Medical Technologies. In 1997, Dey, a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, acquired the exclusive right to market and distribute the EpiPen. In 1998 there was a recall of one million EpiPens, the second such recall in a year.

In 2001 Meridian and Dey introduced a two-pack version of the EpiPen; at that time the device had $23.9 million in annual sales and accounted for 75% of the market in the United States. In 2002 King Pharmaceuticals acquired Meridian for $247.8 million in cash; the deal was completed in January 2003. Kaplan continued to improve his designs over the years, filing for example US Patent 6,767,336 in 2003.

In 2003, Hollister-Stier received approval from the FDA to market an epinephrine autoinjector called Twinject that could deliver two shots of epinephrine, which it had spent ten years developing. In 2005, it sold the product to Verus Pharmaceuticals, which launched the product the same year. In March 2008, Sciele Pharma acquired Twinject from Verus and later that year, Sciele was acquired by Shionogi.

In 2007, Mylan acquired the right to market the EpiPen from Merck KGaA as part of a larger transaction. At that time annual sales were around $200 million and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.

In 2009, Mylan and King started marketing a new version of EpiPen with the same basic mechanism but a stronger spring, better safety features, and clearer markings and instructions; an expert for NBC News estimated that the cost to redesign the device and packaging may have been &quot;several million dollars&quot; and the cost to retool the manufacturing process may have &quot;run into the double-digit millions.&quot;

In 2009, Teva Pharmaceuticals filed an ANDA to market a generic EpiPen in collaboration with Antares Pharma Inc, a maker of injection systems; Pfizer and King sued them for infringing US Patent 7,449,012 that was due to expire in 2025; Pfizer, Mylan, and Teva settled in April 2012 in a deal that allowed Teva to start selling the device in mid-2015, pending FDA approval.

In 2009, Intelliject, a US startup developing a new epinephrine autoinjector, licensed their product to Sanofi.

King was acquired by Pfizer in 2010 for $3.6 billion in cash.

In 2010, Sciele/Shionogi faced a recall of Twinject devices and launched Adrenaclick, a modified version of the Twinject that could deliver only one dose.

In 2010, European regulators approved Twinject, and also approved a new epinephrine autoinjector made by ALK and sold under the brand name Jext. Jext was launched in the European Union in September 2011.

Also in 2010, Shionogi authorized Greenstone, the authorized generics division of Pfizer, to begin selling an authorized generic of Adrenaclick. The media noted that Pfizer, through Greenstone, was marketing a generic epinephrine autoinjector when Pfizer acquired King later that year. At that time, King and Mylan&#x27;s EpiPen had 91% of the global market share for epinephrine autoinjectors and 96% of the US market.

In 2010, Pfizer and King sued Novartis&#x27; Sandoz generic unit for patent infringement after Sandoz submitted an ANDA to sell a generic EpiPen. In response, Sandoz challenged the validity of the patents, and as of July 2016 this litigation was ongoing.

In 2011, Pfizer and King sued Intelliject and Sanofi after the companies filed a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application for the product, then known as &quot;e-cue&quot;; Pfizer, Mylan and Sanofi settled in 2012 under a deal that allowed the device to enter the market no earlier than November 2012, pending FDA approval. In August 2012, the FDA approved the autoinjector, called &quot;Auvi-Q&quot; after the FDA required a name change from &quot;e-cue&quot;. The device is equipped with a sound chip to provide electronic voice instructions to guide the user in the proper use of the device.

In 2012, Mylan launched a program called &quot;EpiPen4Schools&quot; to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.

In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to &quot;help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use&quot;, and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Conelly Manchin, mother of Mylan&#x27;s CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her &quot;daughter&#x27;s company&quot; to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband Joe Manchin, then-governor of the state, in 2012.

In 2012, Shionogi, the manufacturer of Adrenaclick and Twinject, announced it would stop making them; it had sold the rights to the NDA to a company called Amedra Pharmaceuticals.

In June 2013, Amedra relaunched Adrenaclick. and at the same time, Lineage Therapeutics launched its authorized generic version of Adrenaclick. Lineage was a wholly owned subsidiary of Amedra that had acquired the rights to the Adrenaclick authorized generic from Greenstone/Pfizer.

After successful lobbying from Mylan, in 2013, the &quot;School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act&quot; became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn&#x27;t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them. Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan&#x27;s CEO, was a senator at that time.

In January 2015 Mylan filed a citizen petition with the FDA raising concerns about TEVA&#x27;s ANDA application to market a generic EpiPen and filed an additional supplement later in May; the FDA rejected the petition in June.

In March 2015, Impax Laboratories acquired the parent company of Amedra and Lineage, and placed Amedra and the Adrenaclick in its Impax Specialty Pharma division; at the same time it acquired Lineage, which it placed, along with its generic version of Adrenaclick, in its Impax Generics division.

In May 2015, the Emerade epinephrine autoinjector developed by the Swedish company Medeca was approved in Sweden and Germany; it had been approved in the UK in 2013. Also in 2015 Valeant, which had licensed the rights from Medeca, abandoned its efforts to get Emerade approved in the US.

In October 2015, Auvi-Q and Allerject devices were voluntarily recalled by Sanofi in North America. The reason stated by Sanofi was that the products had been found to potentially have inaccurate dosage delivery, which may include failure to deliver drug. In February 2016, Sanofi terminated its license to manufacture and market the Auvi-Q, leaving Kaléo (Intelliject was renamed) to consider how and whether to re-introduce the device.

The EpiPen had 89% of the market for epinephrine autoinjectors in 2015; in the first half of the year it had about 85% share and Auvi-Q had about 10% share.

In March 2016, Teva&#x27;s ANDA for a generic EpiPen, which had already faced several delays, was rejected by the FDA.

In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5 billion in sales of EpiPens, which accounted for 40% of Mylan&#x27;s profit. Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609, around a 500% jump from the price in 2009. The cost of the drug and device to Mylan as of 2016 was about $35. In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized. In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan&#x27;s &quot;EpiPen4Schools&quot; program in New York to determine if the program&#x27;s contracts violated antitrust law and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested. In October 2016, Mylan announced a $465M settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.

On 5 September 2017, FDA posted a warning letter to the manufacturer, Meridian Medical Technologies. The agency warned Meridian Medical for failing to investigate problems with the devices, recall bad batches, and follow-up on problems found. According to the FDA, the manufacturer of EpiPen devices failed to address known malfunctions in its auto-injectors even as hundreds of customer complaints rolled in and failures were linked to deaths. During an inspection, Meridian employees told inspectors that they weren&#x27;t allowed to disassemble and investigate complain samples, because they were allowed to do if only it was “approved by management”.

On 16 August 2018 the FDA approved the first generic EpiPen from Teva Pharmaceuticals.

In an effort to address the supply shortage of EpiPens, on August 21, 2018 the FDA approved extending the expiration dates on some products by four months.

The Sandoz division of Novartis announced on 9 July 2019 the availability of Symjepi, a manual epinephrine injection as an alternative to autoinjectors, in 0.3 mg and 0.15 mg versions.

==Society and culture==
===Brands===
As of 2015, the following epinephrine autoinjectors were available in various parts of Europe: Adrenalina WZF, Adrenaline (epinephrine) 1 in 1000 solution for injection BP auto-injector, Altellus, Anapen, Emerade, EpiPen, Fastjekt, FastPen, and Jext. As of 2018, three branded products were available in the United States: Adrenaclick, Auvi-Q, and EpiPen.

As of 2020, three brands of autoinjectors are available in Canada: Allerject, Emerade, and EpiPen. One generic autoinjector has been approved by Health Canada but is not marketed. From 2015 to 2020 the only autoinjector marketed in Canada was EpiPen and production issues led to supply shortages during that period. During a 2018 shortage of EpiPens, Health Canada temporarily permitted the importation of Auvi-Q autoinjectors from the United States.

As of 2005, epinephrine autoinjectors were not available in most of the developing world.

===Price===
====Canada====
, in Canada the wholesale cost of a single EpiPen is approximately .

====Europe====
, two EpiPens cost around $100 in France and at maximum 10€ for members of the statutory health insurance in Germany.

, two Jext autoinjectors cost users about £8.50 (US$) in Britain, and the National Health Service pays around £48 (US$) in order to make them available; that price was about 17 percent less than 2013.

Supplies of 150 microgram adrenaline auto-injectors were said to be “critical” in the United Kingdom in October 2018. Community pharmacists were told to prioritise supplies for children weighing 25 kg or less. Mylan identified shortages because of manufacturing problems in May 2018.

====United States====
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one EpiPen. The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug. In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.

The EpiPen, manufactured by Meridian Medical Technologies, and marketed by Mylan, has dominated the market. In 2007 when Mylan acquired the rights to market the product, annual sales of all epinephrine autoinjectors were about $200 million and EpiPen had around 90% of the market; in 2015 the market size was around $1.5 billion and Mylan still had about 90% of the market. Mylan raised the price from around $100 for a package of two EpiPens in 2007 to around $600 in 2016. In the United Kingdom, an EpiPen costs £26.45 as of 2015. In Canada they are about 120 CAD each.

Mylan acquired the right to market the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal. Heather Bresch, Mylan&#x27;s CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales in the US through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the &quot;EpiPen&quot; brand as identified with epinephrine autoinjectors as &quot;Kleenex&quot; is for facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.

Mylan&#x27;s efforts to maintain its market dominance were aided when Sanofi&#x27;s competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva&#x27;s generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016. By the first half of 2015, sales of EpiPen accounted for 40% of Mylan&#x27;s profit. Those profits were also due in part to Mylan&#x27;s continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2007, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; the price was about the same in 2009; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609, around a 500% jump from the price in 2009. The last price increase sparked widespread outrage in the late summer as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens. Some Americans responded to the high price by buying EpiPens online from pharmacies outside the US, forgoing new EpiPens and relying on their expired EpiPen, or forgoing an autoinjector altogether and having their children carry pre-loaded syringes. Former Mylan CEO, Heather Bresch testified before the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging to argue that the price change was &quot;fair&quot;.

In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens, a gesture that was called a &quot;classic public relations move&quot; by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim. The up to $300 saving cards can be used only by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost on to consumers. In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program. Under the agreement, Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future; the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.

, the authorized generic of Adrenaclick cost $142 at retail stores.

In September 2016, a group of hackers called the Four Thieves Vinegar published a video and documents describing what they call an EpiPencil, an autoinjector which can be built using off-the-shelf parts, for a claimed price tag of about $30. At its core is a repurposed insulin autoinjector. This device has not been subject to any validation by regulatory agencies.
