<text>The Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Denmark or National Church (, or unofficially ; ), sometimes called the Church of Denmark, is the established, state-supported church in Denmark. The supreme secular authority of the church is composed of the reigning monarch and Denmark&#x27;s Parliament, the Folketing. , 71.4% of the population of Denmark are members, though membership is voluntary.

Chalcedonian Christianity was introduced to Denmark in the 9th century by Ansgar, Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen. In the 10th century, King Harald Bluetooth became a Catholic and began organizing the church, and by the 11th century, Christianity was largely accepted throughout the country. Since the Reformation in Denmark, the church has been Evangelical Lutheran, while retaining much of its high church pre-Reformation liturgical traditions.

The 1849 Constitution of Denmark designated the church &quot;the Danish people&#x27;s church&quot; and mandated that the state supports it as such.

The Church of Denmark continues to maintain the historical episcopate. Theological authority is vested in bishops: ten bishops in mainland Denmark and one in Greenland, each overseeing a diocese. The bishop of Copenhagen is &quot;primus inter pares&quot;.

==Organization==

===Dioceses===
The Church of Denmark is organized into eleven dioceses, each led by a bishop, including one for Greenland (the Faroe Islands was a twelfth diocese until 29 July 2007). The most senior bishop (&quot;primus inter pares&quot;) is the bishop of Copenhagen, currently Peter Skov-Jakobsen. The further subdivision includes 111 deaneries and 2,200 parishes. There are about 2,400 ordained pastors (Danish: &quot;præst&quot;).

===Parishes===
Each parish has a parochial council, elected by church members in four-year terms. The parochial council leads the practical business of the local church and decides employment of personnel, including the pastors, musicians, verger, and sacristan. The pastor (Danish: &quot;præst&quot;) is subordinate to the council, except in spiritual matters such as conducting church services and pastoral care. Parishes in the same local area are grouped into deaneries, with one priest serving as Rural Dean. Deaneries, parochial councils, and pastors are all subordinate to the bishop of the diocese.

====Voluntary congregations====
A special feature is the possibility of creating voluntary (&quot;valgmenighed&quot;) within the Church. These account for a few percent of church members. They are voluntary associations, electing their own parochial council and parish pastor, whom they agree to pay from their own pockets. In return, they are exempt from church tax. The voluntary congregation and its pastor are subordinate to the bishop of the diocese, and members remain full members of the Church. Historically, when a parish was dominated by a conservative majority and priest, the liberal minority would often set up a voluntary congregation with their own priest – and vice versa. Today the voluntary congregations are often a solution for people who find the idea of a free church appealing, but wish to keep some bonds to the church.

====Parish optionality====
Another, less commonly used feature is parish optionality (&quot;sognebåndsløsning&quot;, literally &quot;parish bond release&quot;). If a Church member is dissatisfied with the particular pastor of his residence parish, he may choose to be served by another pastor who matches better with his Christian views, for example in a neighbouring parish.

===Membership===

According to official statistics from January 2023, 72.1% of the inhabitants of Denmark are members of the Church of Denmark, 1.1 percentage points less than the previous year. Membership rates vary from 54.4% in the Diocese of Copenhagen to 82.0% in the Diocese of Viborg. In recent decades, the percentage of Danes that are members of the church has been slowly declining, the most important reasons being immigration from non-Lutheran countries, withdrawal of some members, and a somewhat lower rate (56.2%) of Danish infants being christened.

Any person who is baptised (usually infant baptism) into the Church of Denmark automatically becomes a member. Members may renounce their membership and later return if they wish. Excommunication is legally possible but a rare occurrence. Examples include declared Satanists. A church member supporting reincarnation was excommunicated, but the Supreme Court overturned the excommunication in 2005.

===Faith and church attendance===
According to the latest inquiry about 2.4% of church members attend services every week, although on Christmas Eve more than a third of the population attends. The church is still widely used for traditional family ceremonies including christenings and confirmations. In the year 2022, 31.2% of weddings and 80.7% funerals were performed in the Church of Denmark, and 66.5% of children in grade 7–8 were confirmed. The level of weekly church attendance is similar to that in Norway and Sweden.

According to a 2009 poll, 25% of Danes believed Jesus is the Son of God, and 18% believed he is the saviour of the world.

==Doctrine==
The church is aimed at having a wide acceptance of theological views, as long as they agree with the official symbolic books as stipulated in the Danish Code of 1683. These are:
* The Apostles&#x27; Creed
* The Nicene Creed
* The Athanasian Creed
* The Augsburg Confession
* Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism

Revised versions of the Old and New Testament were authorised by Queen Margrethe II in 1992. A revised Hymn Book was authorised in 2003. Both the Bible translations and the Hymn Book implied widespread public and theological debate.

Historically, there is a contrast between a liberal current inspired by N. F. S. Grundtvig and more strict, pietist or Bible fundamentalist movements (such as Indre Mission). These tensions have sometimes threatened to divide the Church. &quot;Tidehverv&quot; is a minor fraction based on a strict Lutheranism and anti-modern, national-conservative views.

The Church of Denmark is member the World Council of Churches, the Lutheran World Federation, the Communion of Protestant Churches in Europe and the Porvoo Communion.

===Liturgy===

The Communion Service includes three readings from the Bible: a chapter from one of the Gospels, from one of the Epistles or another part of the New Testament and, since 1992, from the Old Testament. Texts are picked from an official list following the church year. Some liturgical features have a fixed content but are free to the form. This accounts for the Common Prayer following the sermon, where the priest is encouraged to mention the royal house. Some will simply mention &quot;the Queen and all her House&quot; whereas others will list all members of the royal house by name and title.

The sermon, as in other Protestant churches, is a central part of the service. The priest takes a starting point in the text of that Sunday, but is free to form a personal message of it. At special occasions, even non-priests may be allowed to preach. Hymns are also very central. In contrast to Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, Danish congregations sit while singing and stand while listening to Bible readings.

As in other Lutheran churches, the Church of Denmark recognizes only two sacraments, Baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper. These are usually included in the Communion Service. Formerly, individual or shared confession was a condition to receive the Lord&#x27;s Supper. An official confession ritual still exists, but is now used very rarely. There are also official rituals for confirmation, wedding, blessing of a civil wedding and funerals. Emergency baptism may be performed by any Christian if necessary, and later the child will then be &quot;ratified&quot; in Church.

==Church and state==


As supreme authority of the Church of Denmark, the monarch must be a member (article 6 of the Constitution). This applies to the royal princes and princesses as well, but does not apply to their spouses. Traditionally, though, every foreigner who has become a member of the royal family has converted or become a member of the church; as a result, the Prince Consort Henrik converted from Catholicism before marrying the Queen in 1968, and Mary Donaldson also converted from Presbyterianism before marrying Crown Prince Frederik in 2004.

===Freedom of religion===
With the Reformation in Denmark in 1536, Lutheran Christianity was established as the state religion. For the next century, in a time when religious wars swept Europe, harsh persecution of other faiths followed (Lutheran orthodoxy). Exceptions were granted only to foreign diplomats. For at least a period in the 16th century, small circles of clandestine Catholicism prevailed. From 1683, Roman Catholic, Reformed and Jewish congregations were allowed in the new town of Fredericia, the latter two also in Copenhagen. Non-Lutherans were also allowed in Friedrichstadt and on Nordstrand in Slesvig and in Glückstadt in Holstein. With the constitution of 1849, freedom of religion was introduced in Denmark, but Lutheranism remained the state church.

====Recognised and approved religions====
A religious community does not need any state approval in order to enjoy the freedom of religion granted by the constitution. However, state-approved congregations (&quot;godkendte trossamfund&quot;) enjoy several privileges. They may conduct legal weddings, establish own cemeteries, get residence permits for foreign priests, are exempt from corporate and property tax, may apply for means from the state lottery fund, and members may tax-deduct membership fees and presents to the congregation.

Additionally, those congregations recognised by royal decree before 1970 (&quot;anerkendte trossamfund&quot;) may name and baptize children with legal effect, keep their own church registers and transcribe certificates on the basis of such registers.

This legal distinction between &quot;recognised&quot; and &quot;approved&quot; communities remains, but is mainly a historical one. Communities recognised before 1970 includes only eight well-established Christian communities as well as one Jewish community. From 1970 until the 1990s only a few more Christian congregations were approved, but since 1998, a much more liberal practice has ensued. Since then, a board of independent experts decide about approval of new religious communities. The board includes professors of law, religious studies and theology and works under the Ministry of Justice, deliberately separate from the Ministry of Ecclesiastical affairs. It merely investigates whether the organisation fulfills basic definitions, such as having a doctrine, creed and cult, in order to be called a congregation of faith. In 2003, the approval of the Forn Siðr religion caused some public debate.

===Lack of central authority===
The Church is in practice barred from having official positions in political or other matters, since it has no central bodies that could define such stances: nor a spiritual leader (such as an archbishop), nor a central assembly or synod. Bishops have the last say on doctrinal questions within their respective dioceses. The King (in practice the Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs) and Parliament are the central bodies, but they usually keep to administrative matters and abstain from interfering with spiritual questions. Church laws are rarely changed, and, when it happens, only administrative matters are affected.

Firstly, these principles are generally believed to ensure a non-sectarian, tolerant church where parishioners and priests enjoy a high degree of freedom to practise their own interpretation of Lutheran Christianity. Secondly, many Danish politicians and theologians claim that only this church-state-model will ensure the division of politics and religion, since the Church cannot interfere with political matters or even claim to speak with one voice on behalf of its members. They frequently discourage the term state church and argue it is, as its name states, the &quot;people&#x27;s church&quot;.

Article 66 of the Danish Constitution stipulates a church ordinance shall be laid down by law. This promissory clause dates back from the first Constitution of 1849 but was never put into practice. It was feared that splits could occur if a central authority were created.

In very few cases have politicians deviated from their traditional hands-off course in church doctrinal matters. Where they have done so, it has been with the declared aim of preventing a possible split in the church. &quot;See the issues of Female clergy and Same-sex marriage below.&quot;

===Civil registration===
The Church of Denmark conducts civil registration of births, deaths, change of name etc. (vital records). The keeping of such &quot;kirkebøger&quot; (&quot;church books&quot;) is a centuries-long tradition, dating from when the parish rectors were the only government representatives in rural areas. In 2002–03 the traditional church records were replaced by a new national electronic registration system called &quot;Personregistrering&quot;. After protests in 2005, the Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder announced that people who for various reasons did not want to send their registration forms (e.g. births and namings) to the local church office could now send their forms to a central office located in Nykøbing Falster.

In 2010 parents&#x27; duty to report the birth of their child was abolished. Instead, it was decided that in the future it was the task of the midwives to report all births in Denmark (only when a midwife isn&#x27;t present at the birth of a child are the parents still obliged to report the birth of the child).

From 1 December 2014 all applications should be submitted in digital form whenever possible.

===Economic support===
Article 4 in the Constitution of Denmark stipulates that &quot;The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, as such, it shall be supported by the State.&quot; On the other hand, article 68 ensures that citizens are not obliged to pay personal contributions to any religion other than their own. It has been questioned how these two principles can co-exist. Non-members do not pay church tax, but an additional state subsidiary accounts for 12% of the Church&#x27;s income. This means every citizen, even a non-member, contributes with an average of 130 kroner annually (US$23). In addition, the bishops are high-ranking officials whose salary is fully paid by the state. In return, certain public tasks are carried out by the Church, such as conducting vital records registries and managing graveyards which are open to all denominations.

===Separation of church and state===

While the debate about separation of church and state emerges occasionally in Denmark, the current arrangement is supported by most political parties. It has been challenged for decades by the left wing and by atheists; more recently also by some ideological liberals and some members of free churches.

Proponents for a separation (disestablishment) argue the state church violates equality of religions and the principle of the secular state. Proponents for the current system argue that membership is voluntary, that the existence of a state church has ancient historical roots, and that the church fulfils certain administrative tasks for the state. They also argue it would be difficult to decide whether church-owned real estate should be handed over to the state or not. The former possessions of the Catholic Church were ceded to the Crown at the reformation in 1536.

According to a poll conducted by the free daily MetroXpress in April 2007, 52% wished to split church and state, 30% were against, and 18% undecided. Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder, spoke out against a split: &quot;Church and state will be separated when more than half of the population are no longer members. N. F. S. Grundtvig said so, and I support that.&quot; The opposition Social Democrats also argued against a split, but said there should be more equality between denominations, possibly by a state subsidiary paid to other approved religious communities as well. Immigrant groups and the Muslim society are divided on the issue, as some think official Christianity is preferable to a purely secular state.

Pure equality of religions exists only in a minority of Western European countries. Besides Denmark, only the Faroe Islands, Iceland, England and Greece have official state churches, while Scotland has an officially recognised &quot;national church&quot; that is not connected to the state. Spain, Portugal, Italy and Austria have official ties to Catholicism (concordat), but these ties do not extend to Catholicism being recognised as the state religion in these countries. Further there are varying degrees of public funding of the church in Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Norway, Sweden, in most cantons of Switzerland, and in the Alsace-Moselle region of France.

==Controversial issues==
=== Female clergy ===
The ordination of women, having been discussed within the church since the 1920s, has been allowed since 1948, despite some rather strong early resistance from the clergy. The then Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs was contacted by a parochial council who wished to employ a female priest. He decided there was no legal obstacle to that. The first woman to become a bishop was instituted in 1995. As of 2021, a majority of priests are women.

Among a small conservative minority, resistance to women ordained as clergy remains. In 2007 the Bishop of Viborg, known as a moderate conservative, revealed that he had given special consideration to priests who were known to be against ordained women. He had organised ordination ceremonies in such a way that new priests who so wished could avoid shaking hands with, or receiving the laying on of hands from, women ordained as priests. According to the bishop, this had happened twice in the 100 ordinations he had performed. The matter became headline news amidst a debate about Muslim fundamentalists who refuse to shake hands with members of the opposite sex. The Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs, Bertel Haarder, said he would discuss the matter with the bishops, but also stated that tolerance for various views should be respected. In contrast, the Minister for Employment, Claus Hjort Frederiksen, thought that the priests in question should be dismissed, as public employees are obliged to shake hands with anyone.

===Same-sex marriage===

A 2011 poll of the Danish public found that 75.8% of Danes approve of same-sex marriages being performed in the church.

According to a 2011 survey of 1137 priests, 62% of them supported same-sex marriage in the Church on the same basis as for heterosexuals, while 28% were against. A map of the results hints at the traditional west–east division, with a conservative wing being dominant in central West Jutland (the former Ringkjøbing Amt) and on Bornholm, but liberal priests dominating in most other cities.

In 2004, a poll among pastors said 60% were against church marriage of same-sex couples.

====Early position of the church====
Since Denmark approved same-sex civil unions (registered partnership) in 1989, the question of church blessing ceremonies for such unions emerged. After an enquiry from the Danish National Association of Gays and Lesbians in 1993, bishops set up a commission to reach a stance on the matter.

An early stance on registered partnerships was reached in 1997. Bishops maintained that the ceremony of marriage was God&#x27;s framework for the relation between a man and a woman, but this view of marriage was not affected by the fact that some people chose to live in a responsible community with a person of the same sex, approved by society, i.e. a registered partnership. The bishops disapproved of institutionalising new rituals, but couples who wished a non-ritualised marking in church of their registered partnership should be obliged. In such cases, it would be up to the rector to decide, and he should seek advice from his bishop.

At this time, many churches chose to bless registered partnerships, however this blessing was distinguished from a legal ceremony, which was performed by a mayor or another municipal official.

====Same-sex marriages accepted====
On 15 June 2012 the Church of Denmark made the decision to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies and not merely bless them; therefore Denmark now recognises same-sex marriages. In early 2012 Minister for Equality, Ecclesiastical Affairs and Nordic Cooperation, Manu Sareen introduced a bill approving same-sex marriage, which was passed in parliament in June 2012. A wedding ritual with liturgy has been developed and presented to parliament by the eleven bishops who are in favor of same-sex marriages being performed in church. Manu Sareen and a majority of bishops initially proposed the ritual would not declare the same-sex couple &#x27;spouses&#x27;, but &#x27;life partners&#x27; (&quot;livsfæller&quot;, a Danish neologism), but the minister later changed his mind on this detail. Two conservative organisations within the church, Inner Mission and Lutheran Mission, as well as one of the twelve bishops, maintain their protests against same-sex marriage. It will be up to each individual priest to decide whether he or she will conduct marriages of same-sex couples. The first same-sex couple was married on Friday 15 June.

The process towards the official recognition of same sex marriage in the Church of Denmark began on 8 February 1973, when &#x27;Provo Priest,&#x27; Harald Søbye, performed a wedding of a male couple, although not legally recognised, on a suggestion from a journalist at the newspaper Ekstra Bladet, which announced it as &#x27;The World&#x27;s First Gay Wedding&#x27;. On 25 February 1973, Harald Søbye performed another wedding, this time of a female couple, in a television programme. The state prosecutor investigated the cases, but concluded that the priest&#x27;s use of his vestment was not illegal. Søbye had been retired in 1964 for political activism, but remained an ordained priest within the church. During the next 15 years, Søbye performed approximately 210 blessings or weddings of same-sex couples.

When Denmark introduced registered partnerships in 1989, the issue of same-sex marriage for some years received little attention. Church blessings of these partnerships slowly gained ground (see above). Later, the possibility of registered partnership, or same-sex marriage, performed by the church came under discussion. The issue was brought up in an unusual way by Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen in 2004, who said he would approve of such a change, although he claimed to speak as a private person on this issue, not as prime minister.

Views among proponents vary whether such a ceremony should be called &#x27;marriage&#x27; or merely &#x27;registered partnership&#x27; &quot;(registreret partnerskab)&quot;, as the original same-sex civil union was called. In practice, clergy have been allowed to decide for themselves whether to perform same-sex marriages or not, similar to the right to deny remarriage of divorced persons (a policy employed by a conservative minority of priests).

====Constitutionality====
A further controversy is that this new practice may be against the Danish constitution; §4 of the Danish constitution states: &quot;The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, as such, it shall be supported by the State.&quot;

§4 not only establish &quot;Folkekirken&quot; as the state church, but also gives certain boundaries as to what the state church is. It is forced to follow the Lutheran doctrines and if, as some critics claim, the Lutheran doctrines explicitly state that homosexuality is a sin then it is a violation of the constitution to allow gay marriages in the state church.

===Gay clergy===
Gay and lesbian clergy exist, and this is generally considered a strictly personal issue. Parish councils are central in selecting and employing new priests, including interviews with candidates. Once employed, parish priests are public servants and cannot be discharged except for neglect of duties, which will finally be the bishop&#x27;s decision.

In 2011 a female priest serving two small island parishes was fired after controversies with the parish council of Agersø, while the neighbouring Omø supported her. She claimed to have been ousted because of her sexuality, but the parish council rejected this accusation and mentioned &#x27;cooperation problems&#x27; as the cause. Twenty years earlier she had come out as lesbian and a practitioner of sadomasochism in a Swedish TV programme.

In 2009 a parish priest in Tingbjerg, a Copenhagen suburb, moved away from the parish to a secret address after assaults against his vicarage, his car and the parish church. The vicarage was put up for sale. According to Avisen.dk, local youths claimed they harassed him because he was openly homosexual, among other reasons. The priest himself denied this was the issue, but rather claimed the assaults were part of a general tendency in the &#x27;crumbling district&#x27;, and intensified after he spoke out in public about the local youth crime. A Sunday service held a few weeks later was attended by several prominent guests supporting the priest, including Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs Bertel Haarder, and photographer Jacob Holdt.
Tingbjerg is a single-plan public housing area, marked by gang violence and youth crime, and the most criminal district of Copenhagen.

===Declaration &quot;Dominus Iesus&quot;===
In 2000, the Church of Denmark&#x27;s ecumenical department publicly criticized the Roman Catholic declaration &quot;Dominus Iesus&quot;, which controversially used the term &quot;ecclesial community&quot; to refer to Protestant denominations, including Lutheran churches. The Church of Denmark argued that there is a destructive effect on ecumenical relations if one church deprives another of the right to be called a Church and that it is just as destructive as if one Christian denies another Christian the right to be called a Christian.

<text>Bedgebury National Pinetum at Bedgebury, Kent, in the United Kingdom, is a recreational and conservational arboretum managed by Forestry England that was established as the National Conifer Collection in 1925 and is now recognised as the most complete collection of conifers on one site anywhere in the world. The collection has over 10,000 trees growing across , including rare, endangered and historically important specimens. Bedgebury National Pinetum conducts conservation work, is home to some 56 vulnerable or critically endangered species, and houses five National Plant Collections.

==History==

Bedgebury is first mentioned in an Anglo-Saxon charter in AD 841, the name deriving from the Old English &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;buy&quot;, and the Kentish , meaning &quot;to bend or turn&quot;, possibly in reference to a stream.

John de Bedgebury is listed as the earliest resident of Bedgebury, in the time of Edward II. In the 15th century Agnes de Bedgebury, sister and heir of John (died 1424) married John Colepeper, whose Colepeper heirs, financed by mining clay-ironstone on the estate, were resident until at the time of the restoration of Charles II, and who created an ornamental park on the Bedgebury estate. Elizabeth I visited in August 1573.

The current house was built in 1688 for Sir James Hayes, a little apart from the old house. The estate later passed to the Stephenson family, who retained it until it was left to a Miss Peach, who sold it in 1789 to John Cartier, Governor of Bengal and High Sheriff of Kent, who improved the plantings and the house.

In the 1840s Viscount William Beresford developed the estate by creating the village of Kilndown and three lodges, one of which – Keepers Lodge, now known as Park House – became the centre of the Pinetum. Beresford initiated the pinetum in the 1850s and his successor, his stepson Alexander Beresford Hope, developed Lady Mildred&#x27;s Drive to enable visitors in carriages to view the trees.

The estate was sold in 1899 to Isaac Lewis, who allowed the collection to fall into neglect, and it was purchased by the Crown Estate in 1918 for its marshy land and drier ridges, as well as its streams, lakes and valleys.

In 1919, the house was bought by the Church Education Corporation to operate as a school. The school closed in 2006.

The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the Forestry Commission established the site as The National Pinetum in a joint venture in 1924, as the National Conifer Collection, because air pollution was rendering London unsuitable for growing conifers. A site at the southern end of Bedgebury Park was chosen, centred on Marshall&#x27;s Lake and a stream-filled valley.

The first plants for the pinetum were raised at Kew Gardens in 1921 and transferred to Bedgebury in 1925 and 1926, alongside Viscount Beresford&#x27;s existing plantings. Development of the collection was managed by the Kew botanist William Dallimore, a world-renowned expert on conifers.

In 1969 management of the pinetum reverted solely to the Forestry Commission, now Forestry England, who extended it in 1977 and created two new lakes. In the Great Storm of 1987 almost a quarter of the trees were brought down.

==The collection==

The aim of Bedgebury National Pinetum is &quot;to grow as many species of conifers as the climatic conditions will allow, planted in generic groupings, using geographically associated plantings where possible.&quot; (W. Dallimore, 1923)

The pinetum holds 10,000 specimens of conifers and other species that grow in temperate zones, including 7,000 trees, as living gene banks and as a genetic resource for future restoration programmes. It holds 2,300 different species of conifer, specimens of which include the tallest tree in Kent (&quot;Abies grandis&quot;) and the three tallest Leyland Cypresses in the UK. The plan is for the pinetum to provide a mix of 70% conifers to 30% broadleaves, and to leave 40% of the site open to provide vistas and allow the trees to be appreciated.

Bedgebury National Pinetum is home to six National Plant Collections accredited with the Plant Heritage charity: Yew, Juniper, Thuja, Lawson&#x27;s Cypress, Leyland Cypress and Cryptomeria japonica.

The collection contains 56 species that have been officially declared vulnerable or critically endangered.

==Conservation==

The scale and quality of Bedgebury National Pinetum&#x27;s conifer collection have made it an ideal site to take part in the International Conifer Conservation Programme (ICCP), run by the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. The ICCP aims to promote the conservation of conifers through conservation work, research and education, and work carried out at Bedgebury makes up part of the effort to conserve the genetic diversity of conifers, particularly those from temperate forests.

The Bedgebury Conifer Conservation Project, initiated in 2007, is designed to use redundant forest plots to grow large numbers – up to 500 – of endangered conifers to provide an ex-situ genetic resource. The first plots were planted with Chilean plum yew by Boy Scouts celebrating their centenary in 2007, and future plantings will include samples from Europe, Asia, North America and Australasia.

Bedgebury nursery was the first to germinate Vietnamese golden cypress (&quot;Xanthocyparis vietnamensis&quot;) and chichibu birch (&quot;Betula chichibuensis&quot;) seeds in cultivation.

<text>The Ubii were a Germanic tribe first encountered dwelling on the east bank of the Rhine in the time of Julius Caesar, who formed an alliance with them in 55 BC in order to launch attacks across the river. They were transported in 39 BC by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa to the west bank, apparently at their own request, as they feared the incursions of their neighbors, the Chatti.

A colony for Roman veterans was founded in 50 AD under the patronage of Agrippa&#x27;s granddaughter, Agrippina the Younger, who had been born at Ara Ubiorum, the capital of the Ubii. The colony derived its title from the names of Agrippina and her husband, the emperor Claudius, and received the name &quot;Colonia Claudia Ara Augusta Agrippinensium&quot;, which is the origin of the city&#x27;s modern name, Cologne. Alongside the allotment of land to veterans, the existing town of Ara Ubiorum was elevated to the status of a &quot;colonia&quot;, which would have conferred many privileges on the inhabitants. The Ubii were also at Bonna (Bonn) of the Eburones.

The Ubii remained loyal allies of Rome; they were instrumental in crushing the Batavian rebellion in 70 AD and, although some of them made part of the invasion of Pannonia in 166 AD, they become &quot;foederati&quot; supporting Roman troops in the Marcomannic Wars in 166–67 AD.

They seem to have been so thoroughly Romanized that they adopted the name &quot;Agrippinenses&quot; in honour of their &quot;founder&quot;, and their later history is submerged with other Franks in that of eastern Gaul as a whole.

==Roman interactions==
In 55 BC, Julius Caesar was preparing for an invasion of Britain, when several Germanic tribes, including the Ubii, crossed the Rhine river. This movement included the Usipetes and Tencteri tribes, who wished to relocate to avoid contact with the Suevi. Caesar, concerned that fighting might break out in the region and draw troops away from his planned invasion, marched toward the Rhine. He met with ambassadors from the Germanic tribe and offered them land with the Ubii and an alliance against the Suevi; however, Caesar soon became worried that the tribes were delaying until their cavalry could return.

Together with the Batavi, the Ubii furnished soldiers for the Germanic bodyguard, the personal bodyguard of the early Roman emperors.

<doc id="271964" wikidata="Q467077" url="?curid=271964" title="Efraín Ríos Montt">
<text>José Efraín Ríos Montt (; 16 June 1926 – 1 April 2018) was a Guatemalan military officer, politician, and dictator who served as &quot;de facto&quot; President of Guatemala from 1982 to 1983. His brief tenure as chief executive was one of the bloodiest periods in the long-running Guatemalan Civil War. Ríos Montt&#x27;s counter-insurgency strategies significantly weakened the Marxist guerrillas organized under the umbrella of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) while also leading to accusations of war crimes and genocide perpetrated by the Guatemalan Army under his leadership.

Ríos Montt was a career army officer. He was director of the Guatemalan military academy and rose to the rank of brigadier general. He was briefly chief of staff of the Guatemalan army in 1973. However, he was soon forced out of the position over differences with the military high command. He ran for president in the 1974 general election, losing to the official candidate, General Kjell Laugerud, in an electoral process widely regarded as fraudulent. In 1978, Ríos Montt controversially abandoned the Catholic Church and joined an Evangelical Christian group affiliated with the Gospel Outreach Church. In 1982, discontent with the rule of General Romeo Lucas García, the worsening security situation in Guatemala, and accusations of electoral fraud led to a coup d&#x27;état by a group of junior military officers who installed Ríos Montt as head of a government junta. Ríos Montt ruled as a military dictator for less than seventeen months before his defense minister, General Óscar Mejía Victores overthrew him in another coup.

In 1989, Ríos Montt returned to the Guatemalan political scene as leader of a new political party, the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG). He was elected many times to the Congress of Guatemala, serving as president of the Congress in 1995–96 and 2000–04. A constitutional provision prevented him from registering as a presidential candidate due to his involvement in the military coup of 1982. However, the FRG obtained the presidency and a congressional majority in the 1999 general election. Authorized by the Constitutional Court to run in the 2003 presidential elections, Ríos Montt came in third and withdrew from politics. He returned to public life in 2007 as a member of Congress, thereby gaining legal immunity from long-running lawsuits alleging war crimes committed by him and some of his ministers and counselors during their term in the presidential palace in 1982–83. His immunity ended on 14 January 2012, when his legislative term of office expired. In 2013, a court sentenced Ríos Montt to 80 years in prison for genocide and crimes against humanity, but the Constitutional Court quashed that sentence, and his retrial was never completed.

==Early life and career==
Efraín Ríos Montt was born in 1926 in Huehuetenango into a large family of the rural middle class. His father was a shopkeeper, and his mother a seamstress, and the family also owned a small farm. His younger brother Mario Enrique Ríos Montt became a Catholic priest and would serve as prelate of Escuintla and later as auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Guatemala.

Intent on making a career in the army, the young Efraín applied to the Polytechnic School (the national military academy of Guatemala) but was rejected because of his astigmatism. He then volunteered for the Guatemalan Army as a private, joining troops composed almost exclusively of full-blooded Mayas, until in 1946, he was able to enter the Polytechnic School. Ríos Montt graduated in 1950 at the top of his class. He taught at the Polytechnic School and received further specialized training, first at the U.S.-run officer training institute that would later be known as the School of the Americas, and later at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and the Italian War College. From the start of his career, Ríos Montt acquired a reputation as a devoutly religious man and as a stern disciplinarian.

Ríos Montt did not play any significant role in the successful CIA-sponsored coup of 1954 against President Jacobo Arbenz. He rose through the ranks of the Guatemalan army and, in 1970–72, served as director of the Polytechnic School. In 1972, in the presidential administration of General Carlos Arana Osorio, Ríos Montt was promoted to brigadier general and in 1973 he became the Army&#x27;s Chief of Staff (&quot;Jefe del Estado Mayor General del Ejército&quot;). However, he was removed from that post after three months and, much to his chagrin, dispatched to the Inter-American Defense College in Washington, D.C. According to anthropologist David Stoll, writing in 1990, Ríos Montt was &quot;at odds with the army&#x27;s command structure since being sidelined by military president Gen. Carlos Arana Osorio in 1974.&quot;

==Early political involvement==

While in the US, the leaders of the Guatemalan Christian Democracy approached Ríos Montt with an invitation to run for president at the head of a coalition of parties opposed to the incumbent regime. Ríos Montt participated in the March 1974 presidential elections as the National Opposition Front (FNO) presidential candidate. His running mate was Alberto Fuentes Mohr, a respected economist and social democrat. At the time, Ríos Montt was generally regarded as an honest and competent military man who could combat the rampant corruption in the Guatemalan government and armed forces. In the run-up to the election, United States officials characterized the candidate Ríos Montt as a &quot;capable left-of-center military officer&quot; who would shift Guatemala &quot;perceptibly but not radically to the left.&quot;

===1974 presidential elections===
The official candidate for the 1974 election was General Kjell Laugerud, whose running mate was Mario Sandoval Alarcón of the far-right National Liberation Movement. Pro-government posters warned &quot;voters not to fall into a communist trap by supporting Ríos,&quot; but Ríos Montt proved to be an effective campaigner, and most observers believe that his FNO won the popular vote by an ample majority.

When early returns showed an unmistakable trend in favor of Ríos Montt, the government halted the count and manipulated the results to make it appear that Laugerud finished 71,000 votes ahead of Ríos Montt. Since Laugerud did not have an outright majority of the popular vote, the government-controlled National Congress decided the election, which chose Laugerud by a vote of 38 to 2, with 15 opposition deputies abstaining.

According to independent journalist Carlos Rafael Soto Rosales, Ríos Montt and the FNO leadership knew the election was fraudulent, but acquiesced in Laugerud&#x27;s &quot;election&quot; because they feared that a popular uprising &quot;would result in disorder that would provoke worse government repression and that a challenge would lead to a confrontation between military leaders.&quot; General Ríos Montt then left the country to take up an appointment as military attaché at the Guatemalan embassy in Madrid, where he remained until 1977. It was rumored that the military high command paid Ríos Montt several hundred thousand dollars in exchange for his departure from public life and that during his exile in Spain his unhappiness led him to excessive drinking.

===Religious conversion===
Ríos Montt retired from the army and returned to Guatemala in 1977. A spiritual crisis caused him to leave the Roman Catholic Church in 1978 and join the &quot;Iglesia El Verbo&quot; (&quot;Church of the Word&quot;), an evangelical Protestant church affiliated with the Gospel Outreach Church based in Eureka, California. Ríos Montt became very active in his new church and taught religion in a school affiliated with it. At the time, his younger brother Mario Enrique was the Catholic prelate of Escuintla.

Efraín Ríos Montt&#x27;s conversion has been interpreted as a significant event in the ascendency of Protestantism within the traditionally Catholic Guatemalan nation (see Religion in Guatemala). Ríos Montt later befriended prominent evangelists in the US, including Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson.

==&quot;De facto&quot; presidency==

=== 1982 military coup ===

The security situation in Guatemala had deteriorated under the government of General Romeo Lucas García. By early 1982, the Marxist guerrilla groups belonging to the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) umbrella organization had made gains in the countryside and were seen as threatening an attack on the capital, Guatemala City. On March 7, 1982, General Ángel Aníbal Guevara, the official party&#x27;s candidate, won the presidential election, a result denounced as fraudulent by all opposition parties. An informal group described as &quot;oficiales jóvenes&quot; (&quot;young officers&quot;) then staged a military coup that overthrew Lucas and prevented Guevara from succeeding him as president.

On March 23, the coup culminated with the installation of a three-person military junta, presided by General Efraín Ríos Montt and composed also of General Horacio Maldonado Schaad and Colonel Luis Gordillo Martínez. Ríos Montt had not been directly involved in the planning of the coup and was chosen by the &quot;oficiales jóvenes&quot; because of the respect that he had acquired as director of the military academy and as the presidential candidate of the democratic opposition in 1974. The events of March 1982 took the U.S. authorities by surprise.

Because of repeated vote-rigging and the blatant corruption of the military establishment, the 1982 coup was initially welcomed by many Guatemalans. Ríos Montt&#x27;s reputation for honesty, his leadership of the opposition in the 1974 election, and his vision of &quot;education, nationalism, an end to want and hunger, and a sense of civic pride&quot; were widely appealing. In April 1982, U.S. Ambassador Frederic L. Chapin declared that thanks to the coup of Ríos Montt, &quot;the Guatemalan government has come out of the darkness and into the light.&quot; However, Chapin soon afterward reported that Ríos Montt was &quot;naïve and not concerned with practical realities.&quot; Drawing on his Pentecostal beliefs, Ríos Montt compared the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse to the four modern evils of hunger, misery, ignorance, and subversion. He also pledged to fight corruption and what he described as the depredations of the rich.

=== Dictatorship ===

The government junta immediately declared martial law and suspended the constitution, shut down the legislature, and set up special tribunals (&quot;tribunales de fuero especial&quot;) to prosecute both common criminals and political dissidents. On April 10, the junta launched the &quot;National Growth and Security Plan&quot;, whose stated goals were to end indiscriminate violence and teach the populace about Guatemalan nationalism. The junta also announced that it sought to integrate peasants and indigenous peoples into the Guatemalan state, declaring that because of their illiteracy and &quot;immaturity,&quot; they were particularly vulnerable to the seductions of &quot;international communism.&quot; The government intensified its military efforts against the URNG guerrillas and, on April 20 1982, launched a new counter-insurgency operation known as &quot;Victoria 82&quot;.

On June 9, General Ríos Montt forced the other two junta members to resign, leaving him as sole head of state, commander of the armed forces, and minister of defense. On 17 August 1982, Ríos Montt established a new &quot;Consejo de Estado&quot; (&quot;Council of State&quot;) as an advisory body whose members were appointed either by the executive or by various civil associations. This Council of State incorporated several representatives of Guatemala&#x27;s indigenous population, a first in the history of the central Guatemalan government.

Under the motto, &quot;No robo, no miento, no abuso&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t steal, I don&#x27;t lie, I don&#x27;t abuse&quot;), Ríos Montt launched a campaign ostensibly aimed at rooting out corruption in the government and reforming Guatemalan society. He also began broadcasting regular TV speeches on Sunday afternoons, known as &quot;discursos de domingo&quot;. According to historian Virginia Garrard-Burnett,

Ríos Montt&#x27;s moralizing message continued to resonate with a significant part of Guatemalan society after he departed from power in 1983. In 1990, anthropologist David Stoll quoted a development organizer as saying that she liked Ríos Montt &quot;because he used to get on television, point his finger at every Guatemalan, and say: &#x27;The problem is you!&#x27; That&#x27;s the only way this country is ever going to change.&quot;

=== Counter-insurgency: &quot;Fusiles y Frijoles&quot; ===
Violence escalated in the countryside under the Guatemalan military&#x27;s plan &quot;Victoria 82&quot;, which included a rural pacification strategy known as &quot;Fusiles y Frijoles&quot; (), often rendered into English as &quot;beans and bullets&quot; to preserve the alliteration of the original. The &quot;bullets&quot; referred to the organization of the Civil Defense Patrols (&quot;Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil&quot;, PAC), composed primarily of indigenous villagers who patrolled in groups of twelve, usually armed with a single M1 rifle and sometimes not armed at all. The PAC initiative was intended both to provide a pro-government presence in isolated rural villages with a majority Mayan population and to deter guerrilla activity in the area. The &quot;beans&quot; component of the counter-insurgency strategy referred to programs seeking to increase civilian-military contact and cooperation by improving the infrastructure and resources the government provided to the Mayan villages. This was meant to create a link in the minds of the indigenous and peasant communities between better access to resources and their cooperation with the Guatemalan government in its military struggle against the insurgents.

General Ríos Montt&#x27;s government announced an amnesty in June 1982 for all insurgents willing to lay down their arms. That was followed a month later by the declaration of a state of siege, curtailing the activities of political parties and labor unions under the threat of death by firing squad for subversion.

Critics have argued that, in practice, Ríos Montt&#x27;s strategy amounted to a scorched earth campaign targeted against the indigenous Maya population, particularly in the departments of Quiché, Huehuetenango, and Baja Verapaz. According to the 1999 report by the UN-sponsored Historical Clarification Commission (CEH), this resulted in the annihilation of nearly 600 villages. One instance was the Plan de Sánchez massacre in Rabinal, Baja Verapaz, in July 1982, which saw over 250 people killed. Tens of thousands of peasant farmers fled over the border into southern Mexico. In 1982, an Amnesty International report estimated that over 10,000 indigenous Guatemalans and peasant farmers were killed from March to July of that year and that 100,000 rural villagers were forced to flee their homes. According to more recent estimates presented by the CEH, tens of thousands of non-combatants were killed during Ríos Montt&#x27;s tenure as head of state. At the height of the bloodshed, reports put the number of disappearances and killings at more than 3,000 per month. The 1999 book &quot;State Violence in Guatemala, 1960–1996: A Quantitative Reflection&quot;, published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, states that Rios Montt&#x27;s government presided over &quot;the most indiscriminate period of state terror. More state killings occurred during Ríos Montt’s regime than during any other, and in the same period the monthly rate of violence was more than four times greater than for the next highest regime.&quot;

On the other hand, the United Nations special rapporteur for the situation of human rights in Guatemala, Lord Colville of Culross, wrote in 1984 that the lot of the rural population of Guatemala had improved under Ríos Montt, as the previous indiscriminate violence of the Guatemalan Army was replaced by a rational strategy of counter-insurgency. Colville also indicated that extrajudicial &quot;killings and kidnappings virtually ceased under the Ríos Montt regime.&quot; According to anthropologist David Stoll, &quot;the crucial difference&quot; between Ríos Montt and his predecessor Lucas García was that Ríos Montt replaced &quot;chaotic terror with a more predictable set of rewards and punishments.&quot; According to analysts Georges A. Fauriol and Eva Loser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, &quot;an important component in the &#x27;normalization&#x27; of the Guatemalan environment was a marked decrease by late 1982 in the state of fear and violence, which allowed the repositioning of Guatemala&#x27;s civilian urbanized leadership toward a more vital role in national affairs.&quot;

Sociologist and historian Carlos Sabino, in a work published initially in 2007 by the &quot;Fondo de Cultura Económica&quot;, noted that the army&#x27;s counter-insurgency in the Guatemalan highlands had been launched at the end of 1981, before the coup that put Ríos Montt in power, and that the reported massacres peaked in May 1982 before dropping off rapidly as a consequence of the policies implemented by the Ríos Montt regime. According to Sabino, the guerrillas were effectively defeated by the PACs organized by Ríos Montt&#x27;s government, which grew to involve 900,000 men and which, &quot;though only very partially armed, completely took away the guerrilla&#x27;s capacity for political action,&quot; as they could no longer &quot;reach the villages and towns, organize rallies, or recruit fighters and collaborators among the peasants.&quot; According to French sociologist Yvon Le Bot, writing in 1992,

In a similar vein, historian Virginia Garrard-Burnett concluded in 2010 that General Ríos Montt&#x27;s military&#x27;s successes &quot;were unprecedented in Guatemala’s modern history&quot; and that &quot;had the Cold War remained the primary lens of historical analysis, [he] might well be remembered as a visionary statesman instead of an author of crimes against humanity.&quot;

Even some of Ríos Montt&#x27;s harshest critics have noted that, in his later political career during the 1990s and 2000s, he enjoyed firm and enduring electoral support in the departments of Quiché, Huehuetenango, and Baja Verapaz, which had seen the worst violence during the 1982–83 counter-insurgency campaign. According to David Stoll, &quot;the most obvious reason Nebajeños like the former general is that he offered them the chance to surrender without being killed.&quot;

=== Support from US and Israel ===
In 1977, the United States under the Jimmy Carter administration suspended aid to Guatemala due to the grave violations of human rights by the Guatemalan government. In 1981, the new Reagan administration authorized the sale to the Guatemalan military of $4 million in helicopter spare parts and $6.3 million in additional military supplies, to be shipped in 1982 and 1983.

President Ronald Reagan traveled to Central America in December 1982. He did not visit Guatemala but met with General Ríos Montt in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on December 4, 1982. During that meeting, Ríos Montt reassured Reagan that the Guatemalan government&#x27;s counter-insurgency strategy was not one of &quot;scorched earth,&quot; but rather of &quot;scorched Communists,&quot; and pledged to work to restore the democratic process in the country. Reagan then declared: &quot;President Ríos Montt is a man of great personal integrity and commitment... I know he wants to improve the quality of life for all Guatemalans and to promote social justice.&quot;

Guatemala&#x27;s poor record on human rights and the refusal of General Ríos Montt to call immediately for new elections prevented the Reagan administration from restoring US aid to Guatemala, which would have required the consent of the US Congress. The Reagan administration did continue the sale of helicopter parts to the Guatemalan military, even though a then-secret 1983 CIA cable noted a rise in &quot;suspect right-wing violence&quot; and an increasing number of bodies &quot;appearing in ditches and gullies.&quot;

Israel, which had been supplying arms to Guatemala since 1974, continued its aid provisions during Ríos Montt&#x27;s government. The cooperation did not just involve hardware but also included providing intelligence and operational training, carried out both in Israel and Guatemala. In 1982, Ríos Montt told ABC News that his success was due to the fact that &quot;our soldiers were trained by Israelis.&quot; There was not much outcry in Israel at the time about its involvement in Guatemala, though the support for Ríos Montt was no secret. According to journalist Victor Perera, in 1985, at a cemetery in Chichicastenango, relatives of a man killed by the military told him that &quot;in church they tell us that divine justice is on the side of the poor; but the fact of the matter is, it is the military who get the Israeli guns.&quot;

=== Removal from power ===

By the end of 1982, Ríos Montt, claiming that the war against the leftist guerrillas had been won, said the government&#x27;s work was one of &quot;techo, trabajo, y tortillas&quot; (&quot;roofs, work, and tortillas&quot;). Having survived three attempted coups, on June 29, 1983, Ríos Montt declared a state of emergency and announced elections for July 1984. By then, Ríos Montt had alienated many segments of Guatemalan society by his actions. Shortly before the visit to Guatemala by Pope John Paul II in March 1983, Ríos Montt refused the Pope&#x27;s appeal for clemency to six guerrillas who had been sentenced to death by the regime&#x27;s special tribunals. The outspoken evangelicalism and the moralizing sermons of the general&#x27;s regular Sunday television broadcasts (&quot;discursos de domingo&quot;) were increasingly regarded with embarrassment by many. The military brass was offended by his promotion of young officers in defiance of the Army&#x27;s traditional hierarchy. Many middle-class citizens were unhappy with the decision, announced on August 1, 1983, to introduce the value-added tax in the country. One week later, on August 8, 1983, his own Minister of Defense, General Óscar Mejía Victores, overthrew the regime in a coup during which seven people were killed.

The leaders of the 1983 coup alleged that Ríos Montt belonged to a &quot;fanatical and aggressive religious group&quot; that had threatened the &quot;fundamental principle of the separation of Church and State.&quot; However, historian Virginia Garrard-Burnett considered that the main underlying reason for his removal from power was that Ríos Montt &quot;had severely stanched the flow of graft to military officers and government officials&quot; and was not responsive to the powerful interest groups represented by the Army&#x27;s high command.

Political violence in Guatemala continued after Ríos Montt was removed from power in 1983. It has been estimated that as many as one and a half million Maya peasants were uprooted from their homes. American journalist Vincent Bevins writes that by corralling indigenous populations from suspect communities into state-established &quot;model villages&quot; (&quot;aldeas modelos&quot;) that were &quot;little more than deadly concentration camps,&quot; Ríos Montt waged genocide differently than his predecessors, although massacres continued apace. Bevins argues this was part of Montt&#x27;s new strategy for fighting communism: &quot;The guerrilla is the fish. The people are the sea. If you cannot catch the fish, you have to drain the sea.&quot;

Efraín Ríos Montt&#x27;s sister Marta Elena Ríos de Rivas was kidnapped on 26 June 1983 in Guatemala City by members of the leftist Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) when she was leaving the primary school where she worked as a teacher. At the time, she was five months pregnant. After General Ríos Montt was deposed in August of that year, the FAR proceeded to kidnap the sister of the new &quot;de facto&quot; president, General Mejía Víctores. The new government flatly refused to negotiate with the kidnappers, but the family of General Ríos Montt obtained the release of his sister Marta on 25 September, after 119 days in captivity, by procuring the publication of an FAR comuniqué in several international newspapers.

== Later political career ==
Ríos Montt founded the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG) political party in 1989. In the run-up to the 1990 general election, polls indicated that Ríos Montt was the most popular candidate, leading his nearest rival by as many as twelve points. The courts ultimately prevented him from appearing in the ballots because of a provision in the 1985 Constitution of Guatemala that banned people who had participated in a military coup from becoming president. Ríos Montt always claimed that the corresponding article had been written into the Constitution specifically to prevent him from returning to the Presidency and that it could not legitimately be applied retroactively.

In the 1990s Ríos Montt enjoyed significant popular support throughout Guatemala and especially among the native Maya population of the departments of Quiché, Huehuetenango, and Baja Verapaz, where he was perceived as &quot;un militar recto&quot; (an honest military man), even though those had been the populations most directly affected by the counter-insurgency that Ríos Montt had led in 1982–83. According to anthropologist David Stoll

According to political scientist Regina Bateson, in this new career phase, Ríos Montt embraced populism as his core political strategy. He was an FRG congressman between 1990 and 2004. In 1994, he was elected president of the unicameral legislature. He tried to run again in the 1995–96 Guatemalan general election but was barred from entering the race. The FRG chose Alfonso Portillo to replace Ríos Montt as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate, and he narrowly lost to Álvaro Arzú of the conservative National Advancement Party. In his youth, Portillo had been affiliated with the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP), one of the Marxist insurgent groups that later became part of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) and which Ríos Montt had combated during his term as president in 1982–83.

The Guatemalan Civil War officially concluded in 1996 with the signing of the peace accords between the Guatemalan government and the URNG, which after that was organized as a legal political party. In March 1999, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared that &quot;for the United States, it is important I state clearly that support for military forces and intelligence units which engaged in violence and widespread repression [in Guatemala] was wrong and the United States must not repeat that mistake.&quot;

Ríos Montt&#x27;s FRG party was successful in the 1999 Guatemalan general election. Its candidate, Alfonso Portillo, was elected president, and the party also obtained a majority in the National Congress. Ríos Montt then served four consecutive one-year terms as president of Congress, from 2000 to 2004.

President Portillo admitted the involvement of the Guatemalan government in human rights abuses over the previous 20 years, including two massacres that took place during Ríos Montt&#x27;s presidency. The first was in Plan de Sánchez, in Baja Verapaz, with 268 dead, and in Dos Erres in Petén, where 200 people were murdered.

===2003 presidential candidate===
In May 2003, the FRG nominated Ríos Montt for the November presidential election. However, his candidacy was rejected again by the electoral registry and by two lower courts. On 14 July 2003, the Constitutional Court, which had had several judges appointed by the FRG government, approved his candidacy for president because the prohibition in the 1985 Constitution did not apply retroactively.

On 20 July, the Supreme Court suspended Ríos Montt&#x27;s campaign and agreed to hear a complaint brought by two right-of-center parties that the retired General was constitutionally barred from running for president. Ríos Montt denounced the ruling as a judicial manipulation and, in a radio address, called on his followers to take to the streets to protest against it. On 24 July, in an event that came to be known as &quot;jueves negro&quot; (&quot;Black Thursday&quot;), thousands of masked FRG supporters invaded the streets of Guatemala City, armed with machetes, clubs, and guns. They had been bussed in from all over the country by the FRG, and it was alleged that public employees in FRG-controlled municipalities were threatened with the loss of their jobs if they did not participate in the demonstrations. The protestors blocked traffic, chanted threatening slogans, and waved machetes as they marched on the courts, the opposition parties&#x27; headquarters, and newspapers. Incidents of torching of buildings, shooting out of windows, and burning of cars and tires in the streets were also reported. A television journalist, Héctor Fernando Ramírez, died of a heart attack while running away from a mob. After two days, the rioters disbanded when an audio recording of Ríos Montt was played on loudspeakers calling them to return to their homes. The situation was so volatile over the weekend that the UN mission and the US embassy were closed.

Following the rioting, the Constitutional Court overturned the Supreme Court decision, allowing Ríos Montt to run for president. However, the &quot;jueves negro&quot; chaos undermined Ríos Montt&#x27;s popularity and his credibility as a law-and-order candidate. Support for Ríos Montt also suffered because of the perceived corruption and inefficiency of the incumbent FRG administration under President Portillo. During tense but peaceful presidential elections on November 9, 2003, Ríos Montt received 19.3% of the vote, placing him third behind Óscar Berger, head of the conservative Grand National Alliance (GANA), and Álvaro Colom of the center-left National Unity of Hope (UNE). As he had been required to give up his seat in Congress to run for president, Ríos Montt&#x27;s 14-year legislative tenure also ended.

In March 2004, a court order forbade Ríos Montt from leaving the country while it determined whether he should stand trial on charges related to &quot;jueves negro&quot; and the death of Ramírez. On November 20, 2004, Ríos Montt had to request permission to travel to his country home for the wedding of his daughter, Zury Ríos, to U.S. Representative Jerry Weller, a Republican from Illinois. On January 31, 2006, manslaughter charges against him for the death of Ramírez were dropped.

==Charges of crimes against humanity==
The Inter-Diocese Project for the Recovery of the Historic Memory (REMHI), sponsored by the Catholic Church, and the Historical Clarification Commission (CEH), co-sponsored by the United Nations as part of the 1996 peace accords, produced reports documenting grave violations of human rights committed during the Guatemalan Civil War of 1960–1996. That war had pitted Marxist rebels against the Guatemalan state, including the Guatemalan army. Up to 200,000 Guatemalans were estimated to have been killed during the conflict, making it one of Latin America&#x27;s bloodiest wars. Both the REMHI and CEH reports found that most of the violence had been carried out by the Guatemalan state and by government-backed death squads. Since the victims of this violence had disproportionately belonged to the indigenous Mayan population of the country, the CEH report characterized the counterinsurgency campaign, significantly designed and advanced during Ríos Montt&#x27;s presidency, as having included deliberate &quot;acts of genocide.&quot;

The REMHI and CEH reports formed the basis for legal actions brought against Ríos Montt and others for crimes against humanity and genocide. Ríos Montt admitted that the Guatemalan army had committed crimes during his term as president and commander-in-chief, but he denied that he had planned or ordered those actions or that there had been any deliberate policy by his government to target the native population that could amount to genocide.

In 1998, Mario Enrique Ríos Montt, younger brother of Efraín Ríos Montt, succeeded murdered bishop Juan Gerardi as head of the Office of Human Rights of the Archdiocese of Guatemala. That office took a leading role in denouncing human rights abuses committed by the state during the Guatemalan Civil War, including during the government of General Ríos Montt.

===In Spain===
In 1999, Guatemalan Nobel Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta Menchú filed a complaint before the &quot;Audiencia Nacional&quot; of Spain for torture, genocide, illegal detention, and state-sponsored terrorism, naming Ríos Montt and four other retired Guatemalan generals (two of them ex-presidents) as defendants. Three other civilians that were high government official between 1978 and 1982 were also named in the complaint. The Center for Justice and Accountability and Asociación Pro Derechos Humanos de España joined in the suit brought by Menchú. In September 2005, Spain&#x27;s Constitutional Court ruled that Spanish courts could try those accused of crimes against humanity, even if the victims were not Spanish nationals.

In June 2006, Spanish judge Santiago Pedraz traveled to Guatemala to interrogate Ríos Montt and the others named in the case. At least 15 appeals filed by the defense attorneys of the indicted prevented him from carrying out the inquiries. On July 7, 2006, Pedraz issued an international arrest warrant against Efraín Ríos Montt and former presidents Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores and Romeo Lucas García (the latter of whom had died in May 2006 in Venezuela). A warrant was also issued for the retired generals Benedicto Lucas García and Aníbal Guevara. Former minister of the interior Donaldo Álvarez Ruiz, who remained at large, and ex-chiefs of police Germán Chupina Barahona and Pedro García Arredondo were also named on the international arrest warrants. Some of those warrants were initially admitted by Guatemalan courts, but they were all ultimately declared invalid in December 2007 by the Constitutional Court.

===In Guatemala===
On January 17, 2007, Ríos Montt announced that he would run for a seat in Congress again in the election to be held later in the year. As a member of Congress, he would again be immune from prosecution unless a court suspended him from office. He won his seat in the September election and led the FRG&#x27;s 15-member congressional delegation in the new legislature.

Ríos Montt&#x27;s immunity ended on January 14, 2012, when his term in office expired. On January 26, 2012, he appeared in court in Guatemala City and was formally indicted by Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz for genocide and crimes against humanity, along with three other former generals. During the court hearing, he declined to make a statement. The court released him on bail but placed him under house arrest pending trial. On March 1, 2012, a judge ruled the charges against Ríos Montt were not covered by the 1996 National Reconciliation Law, which had granted amnesty for political and common crimes committed in the course of the Guatemalan Civil War. On 28 January 2013, judge Miguel Angel Galves opened a pre-trial hearing against Ríos Montt and retired General José Mauricio Rodríguez Sánchez for genocide and crimes against humanity, in particular the killing of 1,771 Maya Ixil Indians, including children.

Ríos Montt went on trial on those charges on 19 March 2013, marking the first time that a former Latin American head of state was tried for genocide in his own country. The trial was suspended on 19 April 2013 by Judge Carol Patricia Flores, following a directive from the Supreme Court of Justice of Guatemala. The judge ordered the legal process to be set back to November 2011, before the retired general was charged with war crimes.

On 10 May 2013, Ríos Montt was convicted by the court of genocide and crimes against humanity and was sentenced to 80 years imprisonment. Announcing the ruling, Judge Iris Yassmin Barrios Aguilar declared that &quot;[t]he defendant is responsible for masterminding the crime of genocide.&quot; She continued: &quot;We are convinced that the acts the Ixil suffered constitute the crime of genocide...[Ríos Montt] had knowledge of what was happening and did nothing to stop it.&quot; The Court found that &quot;[t]he Ixils were considered public enemies of the state and were also victims of racism, considered an inferior race... The violent acts against the Ixils were not spontaneous. They were planned beforehand.&quot; Judge Iris Yassmin Barrios Aguilar referred to evidence that 5.5% of the Ixil people had been wiped out by the army.

On 20 May 2013, the Constitutional Court of Guatemala overturned Ríos Montt&#x27;s conviction on the grounds that he had not been allowed an effective defense during some of the proceedings. Anthropologist David Stoll, though granting that large numbers of innocent civilians were killed by the army under Ríos Montt&#x27;s presidency, questioned both the fairness of 2013 trial and the grounds for the charge of genocide.

General Ríos Montt&#x27;s retrial began in January 2015, but the court later ruled that the proceedings would not be public. It also held that no sentence could be pronounced due to Ríos Montt‘a age and deteriorating physical and mental condition. Earlier, Guatemala&#x27;s forensic authority ruled that Ríos Montt had dementia so severe that he could not defend himself. The retrial had not been completed when Ríos Montt died in April 2018, and the court, therefore, closed the case against him. His co-defendant, former chief of military intelligence José Mauricio Rodríguez Sánchez, was acquitted in September 2018, although the court found that the counter-insurgency strategy of the Guatemalan army had amounted to genocide.

==Death==
Ríos Montt died of a heart attack at his home in Guatemala City on April 1, 2018, at the age of 91. The then-incumbent president of Guatemala, Jimmy Morales, expressed his public condolences over the death of General Ríos Montt.

==In media and popular culture==
Pamela Yates directed &quot;When the Mountains Tremble&quot; (1983), a documentary film about the war between the Guatemalan Military and the Mayan Indigenous population of Guatemala. Footage from this film was used as forensic evidence in the Guatemalan court for crimes against humanity in the genocide case against Efraín Ríos Montt.

&quot;Granito: How to Nail a Dictator&quot; (2011) by Pamela Yates is a follow-up to &quot;When the Mountains Tremble&quot;.

The University of Southern California&#x27;s Shoah Foundation, funded by director Steven Spielberg, is undertaking an extensive analysis of the genocidal Guatemalan civil wars, documented by hundreds of filmed interviews with survivors.

The 2019 Guatemalan horror film &quot;La Llorona&quot; features a character named Enrique Monteverde, based on Ríos Montt.

<text>BBC Radio 6 Music is a British digital radio station owned and operated by the BBC. It primarily plays a wide range of alternative music, from established and emerging artists and bands. In 2002 it was the first national music radio station to be launched by the BBC in 32 years. It is available only on digital media: DAB radio, BBC Sounds, digital television, and throughout northern and western Europe through the Astra 2B satellite.

BBC Radio 6 Music has been described as a &quot;dedicated alternative music station&quot;. Many presenters have argued against the perception that the main focus is indie guitar music. The station itself describes its output as &quot;the cutting edge music of today, the iconic and groundbreaking music of the past 60 years and access to the BBC&#x27;s wonderful music archive&quot;. Its format resembles eclectic radio as seen in other countries, as while there is a programmed playlist there is a wide range of music genres played on the station with pop, rock, dance, electronic, indie, hip-hop, R&amp;B, punk, funk, grime, metal, soul, ska, house, reggae, jazz, blues, world, techno, experimental and many other genres played regularly on the station. Added to this is a greater degree of presenter choice in relation to the programmed playlist in comparison to other BBC radio stations but particularly compared to commercial radio. Since 2014, an annual music festival, 6 Music Festival, has been held in different cities around the United Kingdom and broadcast live on the station. Beginning in 2023 the 6 Music Festival will be held only in Greater Manchester every year with a more scaled back event.

In July 2010, the BBC Trust announced it had rejected a proposal by the BBC to close 6 Music to provide commercial rivals more room. The trust commented that the station was &quot;well-liked by its listeners, was highly distinctive and made an important contribution&quot;. In 2018, 6 Music was the most listened-to digital-only radio station, with an average weekly audience of 2.53 million.

According to RAJAR, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 2.7 million with a listening share of 2.5% as of December 2024.

== History ==
BBC 6 Music was proposed in October 2000 as a &quot;digital-only&quot; radio station to be named &quot;Network Y&quot;. (&quot;Network X&quot; became BBC Radio 1Xtra and &quot;Network Z&quot; became BBC 7, now named BBC Radio 4 Extra).
The station opened at 7 a.m., Monday 11 March 2002, with a show presented by Phill Jupitus. At the start-up, presenters included Liz Kershaw, Andrew Collins, Tom Robinson, Gideon Coe, Janice Long, Chris Hawkins, Gary Burton, Craig Charles, Stuart Maconie, Brinsley Forde, Suggs, Clare McDonnell, Bruce Dickinson, Tracey MacLeod, Sean Hughes, and Bob Harris. The first record played was Ash&#x27;s Burn Baby Burn

6 Music attracted criticism for changing daytime schedules during late 2007 and early 2008, notably including replacing Gideon Coe on the mid morning slot with George Lamb. In response, Lesley Douglas, Controller of BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music at the time, said that the changes were intended to attract more female listeners. She claimed that &quot;men tend to be more interested in the intellectual side of the music, the tracks, where albums have been made, that sort of thing&quot;. This in turn brought on more criticism of perceived sexism on Douglas&#x27; part.
In March 2006, BBC 6 Music moved from Broadcasting House to new studios in the adjacent Wogan House (then called Western House) to allow the regeneration of Broadcasting House.
In 2011, BBC Radio 6 Music started the process of moving some of its presenters, staff, and shows from London and elsewhere to the new studios at MediaCityUK in Salford near Manchester. The studios are located on the ground floor of Dock House. Among programmes broadcast there are &quot;Radcliffe &amp; Maconie&quot;, &quot;The Craig Charles Funk and Soul Show&quot;, and Marc Riley&#x27;s and Mary Anne Hobbs&#x27; shows.

=== Proposed closure ===

In February 2010, in anticipation of a review by the BBC Trust, newspaper reports suggested 6 Music might be axed. The review stopped short of recommending closure but noted that only one in five UK residents were aware the station existed, and that it lacked presenters with credibility as music experts. &quot;The Times&quot; claimed that Mark Thompson, Director General of the BBC, proposed closure as part of a bid to scale back BBC operations and allow commercial rivals more room. A high-profile campaign to oppose closure of the station attracted media attention and led to &quot;#SaveBBC6Music&quot; quickly becoming a trending topic on Twitter. A leading voice in the campaign was Jarvis Cocker, the lead singer for the British band Pulp who presented his own show on BBC 6 Music, &quot;Jarvis Cocker&#x27;s Sunday Service&quot;. A Facebook group set up to oppose the proposed closure gained nearly 180,000 members. A campaign was launched to get the song &quot;Joy Division Oven Gloves&quot; by Half Man Half Biscuit to No. 6 in the UK Singles Chart on 12 April 2010; it entered the Singles Chart that week at No. 56 and the Independent Singles Chart at No. 3.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that following the public outcry over the proposed closure, 6 Music would be rebranded as Radio 2 Extra, retaining a similar playlist but broadcasting for only 12 hours a day but Tim Davie, head of audio and music at the BBC, denied this was a possibility.

Five months after rumours of closure first emerged, the BBC Trust announced that it was not convinced by the BBC Executive&#x27;s plans and that the station would not be closed.

In the first quarter of 2011 some BBC radio services, including 6 Music, were part of an efficiency review conducted by John Myers. His role, according to Andrew Harrison, the chief executive of RadioCentre, was &quot;to identify both areas of best practice and possible savings.&quot; &quot;The Telegraph&quot; suggested that this was due to &#x27;commercial sector criticism&#x27; whilst &quot;The Guardian&quot; cited a National Audit Office report.

BASCA was actively circulating petitions challenging the BBC&#x27;s plan to close down 6 Music.

=== 2020s ===
In 2020, Paul Rodgers, the senior head of commissioning for 6 Music left the station, and was replaced by Samantha Moy as the Head of Station. Moy has made a series of schedule changes, presiding over an &quot;undeniable culture shift at the station&quot;.

Some music executives have questioned the overall strategy at the digital station since 2020, raising doubts about initiatives such as all-day pop programming, stating it to be &quot;more typical of a commercial network rather than a BBC station&quot;, with listeners commenting that themed days are &quot;a sign that they&#x27;re running out of ideas&quot;.

In 2021, Shaun Keaveny left after 14 years of presenting, saying he was &quot;forced out onto the ice floe like an elderly Inuit relative&quot;. Due to audience complaints, the BBC issued a statement that &quot;Radio networks always evolve over time&quot;.

In 2023, long-serving presenters Gideon Coe and Marc Riley had their hours cut to make way for a new evening programme called &quot;New Music Fix Daily&quot; with Deb Grant and Tom Ravenscroft, reducing the hours of new alternative music on the BBC weekly from 20 to eight. Stewart Lee described the move as &quot;a land grab on the sound and attitude that have given the station credibility and purpose&quot;, with insiders stated the move would &#x27;rip the heart out of&#x27; the station.

Some listeners believe the station changes are due to &quot;ageism&quot; and a drive to win younger listeners, and despite the BBC&#x27;s service review of 6 Music suggesting more might be done to attract older listeners, the current network strategy is aimed at growing audiences aged between 25 and 44. Some listeners who campaigned to save the station in 2010 believe the changes are &quot;completely at variance to what we campaigned for, both musically and in its general tone&quot;.

In September 2023, Steve Lamacq announced he was to step down from presenting the daily drivetime programme but would return in January 2024 with a Monday drivetime programme. Huw Stephens took over Lamacq&#x27;s slot on Tuesdays to Fridays.

On 11 February 2024, 6 Music broadcast from Wogan House for the final time after 18 years, with Gideon Coe sitting in for Cerys Matthews. The station has now returned to new studios inside Broadcasting House.

In January 2025 Lauren Laverne announced that she would be moving to the mid-morning slot, with Nick Grimshaw replacing her as the new Breakfast Show host. Grimshaw had already been covering for Laverne on the Breakfast Show for 4 months following Laverne&#x27;s cancer diagnosis.

==Statistics==
===Ratings and listenership===
In February 2010, 6 Music was reported as showing growth in its audience, winning an audience of 695,000 listeners over the first quarter, up 12.3% year-on-year. However, in the quarter to December 2009, its &quot;reach&quot; (proportion of the adult population who listen for at least five minutes in the course of an average week) was 1%, and Total Survey Area share (of total listening time) was 0.4%.

According to the BBC&#x27;s service review of Radio 2 and 6 Music, published in February 2010, the average age of 6 Music listeners was 36, which led the authors to suggest more might be done to attract older listeners, considering the station played a broad range of music from the 1960s to the present day. The review also claimed that the deficiency in appeal to female listeners apparent in 2007 was still in existence, and that there should be changes to attract more listeners from ethnic minorities and lower income groups. However, the review did not give details of the scale of these issues.

Following the proposal to close the station, online listening figures rose significantly. The number of weekly unique online listeners rose to an average of 133,653 in March 2010, up 50 per cent on the previous March. When the RAJAR listening figures were released in May 2010, it was revealed that 6 Music had an average of 1.02 million listeners in the first three months of the year, compared to 695,000 the previous year.

In 2011, 6 Music had a total audience of 1.3 million listeners in the three months to 27 March, up from 1.14m in the previous quarter, according to the latest data from the Radio Joint Audience Research (RAJAR) board. Buoyed by shows from high-profile DJs such as Jarvis Cocker, Huey Morgan and Lauren Laverne, 6 Music has also grown its audience from 1.02m in the first quarter of 2010. The station broke more records in 2012, with a total audience of 1.62 million in the third quarter of the year. For the last month of 2012 RAJAR reported 6 Music listening figures had overtaken BBC Radio 4 Extra to become the most-listened-to digital-only radio station in the United Kingdom. The same report also showed that 6 Music had surpassed BBC Radio 3 in listening share, an increase of 31% from the year previously.

In 2014, a report was released stating that BBC Radio 6 Music had overtaken BBC Radio 3 in numbers of listeners per week for the first time. The digital station&#x27;s weekly average was 1.89m listeners (up 5.5% on 2013) while BBC Radio 3&#x27;s average weekly listenership was 1.884m.

In 2018, BBC Radio 6 Music was the 10th most popular radio station as measured by weekly reach – between Talksport and Absolute Radio – and the 6th most popular as measured by listener hours – between BBC Radio 5 Live and Kiss.

Listener figures peaked at 2.8million in 2022, with figures in 2023 down slightly to 2.7 million, remaining at 2.7million in 2024.

==Press coverage==
===Nominations and awards===
Several of BBC 6 Music&#x27;s presenters and shows have won Sony Radio Academy Awards. In 2006 presenter Marc Riley won a Silver award for The Music Radio Personality of the Year. In April 2008, comedy duo Adam and Joe&#x27;s 6 Music Saturday morning show won the Broadcasting Press Guild award for Radio Programme of the Year. George Lamb also won the Sony &#x27;Rising Star&#x27; award. In May 2009, Adam and Joe won three Sony Radio Silver awards.

Following the announcement that 6 Music was to be closed, Adam and Joe won the best comedy prize at the Sony Radio Academy Awards in May 2010, with Jarvis Cocker winning the rising star award, voted for by listeners, for their 6 Music shows. Two years later, the station was named UK Station of the Year at the Sonys, with the judges citing its &quot;confidence across its schedule that not only reflects a real passion for music but also a firm understanding of the audience they are broadcasting to.&quot;

===Controversies===
In 2007 BBC 6 Music was in the press because of scandals over rigged competitions. It emerged that in 2006 the &quot;Liz Kershaw Show&quot; faked a competition by using producers and their friends as &quot;competition winners&quot;, leading to the firing of a junior producer. On 20 September 2007, it was announced that the Head of Programmes, Ric Blaxill, had resigned.

In May 2008 George Lamb was reprimanded for using his programme to back Conservative candidate Boris Johnson for London mayor.

==Events==
===6 Music Festival===
In January 2014 the BBC launched 6 Music Festival, a new music festival featuring artists that &quot;share the alternative spirit of the network&quot;. The festival takes place in a different city each year, with the first edition held in Manchester in February 2014 and headlined by Damon Albarn. Tickets sold out in six minutes for the event, but Albarn&#x27;s headline set was criticised and it was claimed that the festival &quot;just didn&#x27;t work&quot;.

6 Music Festival returned in 2015 in Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead, with performances from Neneh Cherry, Royal Blood, The Charlatans and Hot Chip. The festival was praised as a &quot;triumphant celebration of the left-field&quot;, and compared favourably to the 2014 event. The 2016 event was held across three venues in Bristol with performances from Foals and Bloc Party. The daily capacity was 5,000.

The 2017 edition took place in March of that year (unlike previous festivals, which took place in February) in Glasgow, and included major sets from Future Islands, Sparks, Depeche Mode, The Shins and Belle and Sebastian. It again included evening gigs, daytime gigs, talks and screenings. No festival took place in 2018. However, the station did curate the Belfast event of the Biggest Weekend.

The 2019 edition of the festival took place in Liverpool. It ran for three days across four different venues and included sets from The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen, Anna Calvi, John Grant, Idles, Fontaines D.C. and She drew the gun.

The 2020 edition was held at the Roundhouse in Chalk Farm, London.

The 2022 edition took place in Cardiff. Róisín Murphy headlined the Saturday night event.

The 2023 BBC Radio 6 Music Festival was held in Manchester at the O2 Victoria Warehouse (headline acts), Band on the Wall (BBC Music Introducing showcases) and RAMONA (DJ mix show). Acts taking part included Tim Burgess, Christine and the Queens, Hot Chip, Lava La Rue, Phoebe Green, Antony Szmierek, Afflecks Palace, Arlo Parks and the Big Moon.

<text>In object-oriented programming languages, a mixin (or mix-in) is a class that contains methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. How those other classes gain access to the mixin&#x27;s methods depends on the language. Mixins are sometimes described as being &quot;included&quot; rather than &quot;inherited&quot;.

Mixins encourage code reuse and can be used to avoid the inheritance ambiguity that multiple inheritance can cause (the &quot;diamond problem&quot;), or to work around lack of support for multiple inheritance in a language. A mixin can also be viewed as an interface with implemented methods. This pattern is an example of enforcing the dependency inversion principle.

==History==
Mixins first appeared in Symbolics&#x27;s object-oriented Flavors system (developed by Howard Cannon), which was an approach to object-orientation used in Lisp Machine Lisp. The name was inspired by Steve&#x27;s Ice Cream Parlor in Somerville, Massachusetts: The owner of the ice cream shop offered a basic flavor of ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, etc.) and blended in a combination of extra items (nuts, cookies, fudge, etc.) and called the item a &quot;mix-in&quot;, his own trademarked term at the time.

==Definition==
Mixins are a language concept that allows a programmer to inject some code into a class. Mixin programming is a style of software development, in which units of functionality are created in a class and then mixed in with other classes.

A mixin class acts as the parent class, containing the desired functionality. A subclass can then inherit or simply reuse this functionality, but not as a means of specialization. Typically, the mixin will export the desired functionality to a child class, without creating a rigid, single &quot;is a&quot; relationship. Here lies the important difference between the concepts of mixins and inheritance, in that the child class can still inherit all the features of the parent class, but, the semantics about the child &quot;being a kind of&quot; the parent need not be necessarily applied.

==Advantages==
# It provides a mechanism for multiple inheritance by allowing one class to use common functionality from multiple classes, but without the complex semantics of multiple inheritance.
# Code reusability: Mixins are useful when a programmer wants to share functionality between different classes. Instead of repeating the same code over and over again, the common functionality can simply be grouped into a mixin and then included into each class that requires it.
# Mixins allow inheritance and use of only the desired features from the parent class, not necessarily all of the features from the parent class.

==Implementations==
In Simula, classes are defined in a block in which attributes, methods and class initialization are all defined together; thus all the methods that can be invoked on a class are defined together, and the definition of the class is complete.

In Flavors, a mixin is a class from which another class can inherit slot definitions and methods. The mixin usually does not have direct instances. Since a Flavor can inherit from more than one other Flavor, it can inherit from one or more mixins. Note that the original Flavors did not use generic functions.

In New Flavors (a successor of Flavors) and CLOS, methods are organized in &quot;generic functions&quot;. These generic functions are functions that are defined in multiple cases (methods) by class dispatch and method combinations.

CLOS and Flavors allow mixin methods to add behavior to existing methods: codice_1 and codice_2 daemons, whoppers and wrappers in Flavors. CLOS added codice_3 methods and the ability to call shadowed methods via . So, for example, a stream-lock-mixin can add locking around existing methods of a stream class. In Flavors one would write a wrapper or a whopper and in CLOS one would use an codice_3 method. Both CLOS and Flavors allow the computed reuse via method combinations. codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3 methods are a feature of the standard method combination. Other method combinations are provided.

An example is the codice_8 method combination, where the resulting values of each of the applicable methods of a generic function are arithmetically added to compute the return value. This is used, for example, with the border-mixin for graphical objects. A graphical object may have a generic width function. The border-mixin would add a border around an object and has a method computing its width. A new class codice_9 (that is both a graphical object and uses the codice_10 mixin) would compute its width by calling all applicable width methods—via the codice_8 method combination. All return values are added and create the combined width of the object.

In an OOPSLA 90 paper, Gilad Bracha and William Cook reinterpret different inheritance mechanisms found in Smalltalk, Beta and CLOS as special forms of a mixin inheritance.

==Programming languages that use mixins==
Other than Flavors and CLOS (a part of Common Lisp), some languages that use mixins are:

*Ada (by extending an existing tagged record with arbitrary operations in a generic)
*C# (since C# 8.0, by means of &quot;default methods&quot; of interfaces)
*Cobra
*ColdFusion (Class based using includes and Object based by assigning methods from one object to another at runtime)
*Curl (with Curl RTE)
*D (called &quot;template mixins&quot;; D also includes a &quot;mixin&quot; statement that compiles strings as code.)
*Dart
*Eiffel (called &quot;non-conforming inheritance&quot;; uses normal classes inherited using the &quot;inherit {NONE}&quot; keyword) 
*Factor
*Groovy
*Go (by struct embedding)
*Java (since Java 8, by means of &quot;default methods&quot; of interfaces)
*JavaScript Delegation - Functions as Roles (Traits and Mixins)
*Kotlin
*Less
*Magik
*MATLAB
*OCaml
*ooRexx
*Perl (through roles in the Moose extension of the Perl 5 object system)
*PHP&#x27;s &quot;traits&quot;
*Python
*Racket (mixins documentation)
*Raku
*Ruby
*Rust
*Sass
*Scala
*Smalltalk
*Swift
*SystemVerilog
*XOTcl/TclOO (object systems builtin to Tcl)
*TypeScript (mixins documentation)
*Vala
Some languages do not support mixins on the language level, but can easily mimic them by copying methods from one object to another at runtime, thereby &quot;borrowing&quot; the mixin&#x27;s methods. This is also possible with statically typed languages, but it requires constructing a new object with the extended set of methods.

Other languages that do not support mixins can support them in a round-about way via other language constructs. For example, Visual Basic .NET and C# support the addition of extension methods on interfaces, meaning any class implementing an interface with extension methods defined will have the extension methods available as pseudo-members.

==Examples==

===In Common Lisp===
Common Lisp provides mixins in CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) similar to Flavors.

codice_12 is a generic function with one argument that uses the codice_8 method combination. This combination determines that all applicable methods for a generic function will be called and the results will be added.
(defgeneric object-width (object)
 (:method-combination +))
codice_14 is a class with one slot for the button text.
(defclass button ()
 ((text :initform &quot;click me&quot;)))
There is a method for objects of class button that computes the width based on the length of the button text. codice_8 is the method qualifier for the method combination of the same name.
(defmethod object-width + ((object button))
 (* 10 (length (slot-value object &#x27;text))))
A codice_16 class. The naming is just a convention. There are no superclasses, and no slots.
(defclass border-mixin () ())
There is a method computing the width of the border. Here it is just 4.
(defmethod object-width + ((object border-mixin))
 4)
codice_9 is a class inheriting from both codice_16 and codice_14.
(defclass bordered-button (border-mixin button) ())
We can now compute the width of a button. Calling codice_12 computes 80. The result is the result of the single applicable method: the method codice_12 for the class codice_14.
? (object-width (make-instance &#x27;button))
80
We can also compute the width of a codice_9. Calling codice_12 computes 84. The result is the sum of the results of the two applicable methods: the method codice_12 for the class codice_14 and the method codice_12 for the class codice_16.
? (object-width (make-instance &#x27;bordered-button))
84
===In Python===
In Python, an example of the mixin concept is found in the codice_29 module, which has both a codice_30 class and a codice_31 class. They act as servers for UDP and TCP socket servers, respectively. Additionally, there are two mixin classes: codice_32 and codice_33. Normally, all new connections are handled within the same process. By extending codice_31 with the codice_33 as follows:
class ThreadingTCPServer(ThreadingMixIn, TCPServer):
 pass
the codice_33 class adds functionality to the TCP server such that each new connection creates a new thread. Using the same method, a codice_37 can be created without having to duplicate the code in codice_33. Alternatively, using the codice_32 would cause the process to be forked for each new connection. Clearly, the functionality to create a new thread or fork a process is not terribly useful as a stand-alone class.

In this usage example, the mixins provide alternative underlying functionality without affecting the functionality as a socket server.

===In Ruby===
Most of the Ruby world is based around mixins via codice_40. The concept of mixins is implemented in Ruby by the keyword codice_41 to which we pass the name of the module as parameter.

Example:

class Student
 include Comparable # The class Student inherits the Comparable module using the &#x27;include&#x27; keyword
 attr_accessor :name, :score

 def initialize(name, score)
 @name = name
 @score = score
 end

 # Including the Comparable module requires the implementing class to define the &lt;=&gt; comparison operator
 # Here&#x27;s the comparison operator. We compare 2 student instances based on their scores.

 def &lt;=&gt;(other)
 @score &lt;=&gt; other.score
 end

 # Here&#x27;s the good bit - I get access to &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;,&gt;= and other methods of the Comparable Interface for free.
end

s1 = Student.new(&quot;Peter&quot;, 100)
s2 = Student.new(&quot;Jason&quot;, 90)

s1 &gt; s2 #true
s1 &lt;= s2 #false

===In JavaScript===
The &quot;Object-Literal and codice_42 Approach&quot;

It is technically possible to add behavior to an object by binding functions to keys in the object. However, this lack of separation between state and behavior has drawbacks:

# It intermingles properties of the model domain with that of implementation domain.
# No sharing of common behavior. Metaobjects solve this problem by separating the domain specific properties of objects from their behaviour specific properties.

An extend function is used to mix the behavior in:
&#x27;use strict&#x27;;

const Halfling = function (fName, lName) {
 this.firstName = fName;
 this.lastName = lName;

const mixin = {

&#x27;use strict&#x27;;

// Creating an object
const obj1 = {
 name: &#x27;Marcus Aurelius&#x27;,
 city: &#x27;Rome&#x27;,
 born: &#x27;121-04-26&#x27;

// Mixin 1
const mix1 = {
 toString() {
 return `${this.name} was born in ${this.city} in ${this.born}`;
 age() {
 const year = new Date().getFullYear();
 const born = new Date(this.born).getFullYear();
 return year - born;
};
// Mixin 2
const mix2 = {
 toString() {
 return `${this.name} - ${this.city} - ${this.born}`;
};

// Adding the methods from mixins to the object using Object.assign()
Object.assign(obj1, mix1, mix2);

console.log(obj1.toString()); // Marcus Aurelius - Rome - 121-04-26
console.log(`His age is ${obj1.age()} as of today`); // His age is 1897 as of today
The pure function and delegation based &quot;Flight-Mixin Approach&quot;

Even though the firstly described approach is mostly widespread the next one is closer to what JavaScript&#x27;s language core fundamentally offers - Delegation.

Two function object based patterns already do the trick without the need of a third party&#x27;s implementation of codice_42.
&#x27;use strict&#x27;;

// Implementation
const EnumerableFirstLast = (function () { // function based module pattern.
 const first = function () {
 return this[0];
 last = function () {
 return this[this.length - 1];
 return function () { // function based Flight-Mixin mechanics ...
 this.first = first; // ... referring to ...
 this.last = last; // ... shared code.
}());

// Application - explicit delegation:
// applying [first] and [last] enumerable behavior onto [Array]&#x27;s [prototype].
EnumerableFirstLast.call(Array.prototype);

// Now you can do:
const a = [1, 2, 3];
a.first(); // 1
a.last(); // 3

===In other languages===
In the Curl web-content language, multiple inheritance is used as classes with no instances may implement methods. Common mixins include all skinnable codice_44s inheriting from codice_45, user interface delegate objects that require dropdown menus inheriting from StandardBaseDropdownUI and such explicitly named mixin classes as codice_46, codice_47 and codice_48 class. Version 7.0 added library access so that mixins do not need to be in the same package or be public abstract. Curl constructors are factories that facilitates using multiple-inheritance without explicit declaration of either interfaces or mixins.

==Interfaces and traits==
Java 8 introduces a new feature in the form of default methods for interfaces. Basically it allows a method to be defined in an interface with application in the scenario when a new method is to be added to an interface after the interface class programming setup is done. To add a new function to the interface means to implement the method at every class which uses the interface. Default methods help in this case where they can be introduced to an interface any time and have an implemented structure which is then used by the associated classes. Hence default methods add the ability to applying the mixin concept in Java.

Interfaces combined with aspect-oriented programming can also produce full-fledged mixins in languages that support such features, such as C# or Java. Additionally, through the use of the marker interface pattern, generic programming, and extension methods, C# 3.0 has the ability to mimic mixins. With Dart 2.7 and C# 3.0 came the introduction of extension methods which can be applied, not only to classes, but also to interfaces. Extension Methods provide additional functionality on an existing class without modifying the class. It then becomes possible to create a static helper class for specific functionality that defines the extension methods. Because the classes implement the interface (even if the actual interface doesn’t contain any methods or properties to implement) it will pick up all the extension methods also. C# 8.0 adds the feature of default interface methods.

ECMAScript (in most cases implemented as JavaScript) does not need to mimic object composition by step-wise copying fields from one object to another. It natively supports Trait and mixin based object composition via function objects that implement additional behavior and then are delegated via codice_49 or codice_50 to objects that are in need of such new functionality.

===In Scala===
Scala has a rich type system and Traits are a part of it which helps implement mixin behaviour. As their name reveals, Traits are usually used to represent a distinct feature or aspect that is normally orthogonal to the responsibility of a concrete type or at least of a certain instance.
For example, the ability to sing is modeled as such an orthogonal feature: it could be applied to Birds, Persons, etc.
trait Singer{
 def sing { println(&quot; singing … &quot;) }
 //more methods

class Bird extends Singer
Here, Bird has mixed in all methods of the trait into its own definition as if class Bird had defined method sing() on its own.

As codice_51 is also used to inherit from a super class, in case of a trait codice_51 is used if no super class is inherited and only for mixin in the first trait. All following traits are mixed in using keyword codice_53.
class Person
class Actor extends Person with Singer
class Actor extends Singer with Performer
Scala allows mixing in a trait (creating an anonymous type) when creating a new instance of a class. In the case of a Person class instance, not all instances can sing. This feature comes use then:
class Person{
 def tell { println (&quot; Human &quot;) }
 //more methods

val singingPerson = new Person with Singer
singingPerson.sing
=== In Rust ===
Rust makes extensive use of mixins via &quot;traits&quot;. Traits, like in Scala, allow users to implement behaviours for a defined type. They are also used for generics and dynamic dispatch, allowing types implementing a trait to be used interchangeably statically or dynamically at runtime.
// Allows for types to &quot;speak&quot;
trait Speak {
 fn speak();

 // Rust allows implementors to define default implementations for functions defined in traits
 fn greet() {
 println!(&quot;Hi!&quot;)
}

struct Dog;

impl Speak for Dog {
 fn speak() {
 println!(&quot;Woof woof&quot;);
}

struct Robot;

impl Speak for Robot {
 fn speak() {
 println!(&quot;Beep beep boop boop&quot;);

 // Here we override the definition of Speak::greet for Robot
 fn greet() {
 println!(&quot;Robot says howdy!&quot;)
}
===In Swift===
Mixin can be achieved in Swift by using a language feature called Default implementation in Protocol Extension.
protocol ErrorDisplayable {
 func error(message:String)

extension ErrorDisplayable {
 func error(message:String) {
 // Do what it needs to show an error
 print(message)
}

struct NetworkManager : ErrorDisplayable {
 func onError() {
 error(&quot;Please check your internet Connection.&quot;)
}

<text>Sky Sci-Fi (formerly Sci Fi Channel and Syfy) is a British pay television channel owned and operated by Sky, a division of Comcast. 

Launched as The Sci-Fi Channel, it was relaunched as Syfy on 13 April 2010, as part of an ongoing global rebranding. The relaunch was accompanied by the premieres of &quot;V&quot; and &quot;Human Target&quot;. The channel was given a new on-air look and a tagline of &quot;Imagine greater&quot;.

Sky applied for a Sky Sci-Fi trademark on 4 May 2022. On 14 June 2022 Sky confirmed that the channel rebrand would take place at 11am on 26 July, accompanied by a refreshed schedule of new and existing content.

==History==
It was launched in 1995 as a localised variant of the US network Sci Fi Channel (now Syfy), with a similar programming line-up. It was on air each day from 8:00 am until 2:00 am, but only on cable as a lack of transponder space on satellite meant that it was only able to broadcast for few hours each day on that platform. It wasn&#x27;t until the launch of Sky Digital in 1998 that the channel&#x27;s full broadcast hours were available on satellite.

Programming in the channel&#x27;s early years followed the US channel&#x27;s model, then consisting largely of archive shows such as &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, and films from the Paramount and MCA vaults. The channel was also notable for being one of the first UK television channels to show anime movies and television series on a regular basis. These programming choices were supplemented by a few 1980s animated series shown in the mornings such as &quot;Robotech&quot;, &quot;Bionic Six&quot; and &quot;G-Force&quot;, although they were dropped as the channel&#x27;s lineup became more independent of the original US channel.

Currently, most archive and anime programming have been phased out of the channel, which now concentrates on contemporary show, movies, and other programming. One original UK production was the late-night show &quot;Headf**k&quot;, which featured excerpts from unusual TV shows, short films (including &quot;Chris Barfoot&quot; &#x27;Phoenix&#x27; and &#x27;The Reckoning&#x27;) and music videos from around the world. Later episodes were presented by David Icke.

Programmes on the channel throughout more recent times have included UK premieres of big name US shows like &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, &quot;Eureka&quot;, and more recently &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;Legend of the Seeker&quot; and Joss Whedon&#x27;s &quot;Dollhouse&quot;. Also shown as of February 2007 are digitally remastered episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot; (not to be confused with the remastered series with new CGI); in October the channel secured an exclusive deal with CBS to air &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episodes, remastered from original film elements to current HD standards with new HD CGI sequences, and as of November 2012 have been broadcasting them in (mostly) chronological order.

==Current programming==

===Acquired programming===
*&quot;The Ark&quot;
*&quot;Chucky&quot;
*&quot;SurrealEstate&quot;

==Viewership and reach==
As of April 2008, the channel reached an average of three million UK and Ireland households a week, appealing equally to male and female demographics.

Initially, the channel shared its analogue satellite transponder with no less than five other channels, limiting its output to early evenings and late nights with the rest of its continuous daytime programming (including cartoons) restricted to cable customers. With the launch of Sky Digital in the UK the channel eventually expanded to exclusive broadcasting on its own channel and now broadcasts round the clock most days each week.

==Most watched programmes==
The following is a list of the ten most watched shows on Syfy (previously Sci-Fi), based on Live +7 data supplied by BARB up to 10 September 2017. The number of viewers does not include viewers from Ireland, repeats or airings on Syfy +1.
==HD feed==
A high-definition simulcast channel was launched on the Sky+ HD service as the 31st high-definition channel on Sky. A range of high definition movies, including Sci Fi Channel original production &quot;Ba&#x27;al: The Storm God&quot;, aired on the channel along with &quot;Eli Stone&quot;, &quot;Tin Man&quot; and &quot;Sanctuary&quot;.

It was added to Virgin TV on 1 April 2010.

<text>In many historical societies, the position of kingship carried a sacral meaning and was identical with that of a high priest and judge. Divine kingship is related to the concept of theocracy, although a sacred king need not necessarily rule through his religious authority; rather, the temporal position itself has a religious significance behind it. The monarch may &quot;be&quot; divine,
&quot;become&quot; divine,
or &quot;represent&quot; divinity to a greater or lesser extent. 

In sacred kingship the king often has little political power, and is contrasted with divine kingship where the king triumphs in the politicoreligious struggle between the people and the king. A sacred king is often encumbered with rituals and used as a scapegoat for disasters such as famine and drought, however can become divine and achieve greater power.

== History ==
Sir James George Frazer used the concept of the sacred king in his study &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; (1890–1915), the title of which refers to the myth of the Rex Nemorensis. Frazer gives numerous examples, cited below, and was an inspiration for the myth and ritual school. However, &quot;the myth and ritual, or myth-ritualist, theory&quot; is disputed; many scholars now believe that myth and ritual share common paradigms, but not that one developed from the other.

According to Frazer, the notion has prehistoric roots and occurs worldwide, on Java as in sub-Saharan Africa, with shaman-kings credited with rainmaking and assuring fertility and good fortune. The king might also be designated to suffer and atone for his people, meaning that the sacral king could be the pre-ordained victim in a human sacrifice, either killed at the end of his term in the position, or sacrificed in a time of crisis (e.g. the Blót of Domalde).

In Africa, sacred kings are often represented as volatile and potentially dangerous wild animals. The Ashanti flogged a newly selected king (&quot;Ashantehene&quot;) before enthroning him.

From the Bronze Age in the Near East, the enthronement and anointment of a monarch is a central religious ritual, reflected in the titles &quot;Messiah&quot; or &quot;Christ&quot;, which became separated from worldly kingship. Thus Sargon of Akkad described himself as &quot;deputy of Ishtar&quot;, just as the modern Catholic Pope takes the role of the &quot;Vicar of Christ&quot;.

Kings are styled as shepherds from earliest times, e.g., the term applied to Sumerian princes such as Lugalbanda in the 3rd millennium BCE. The image of the shepherd combines the themes of leadership and the responsibility to supply food and protection, as well as superiority.

As the mediator between the people and the divine, the sacral king was credited with special wisdom (e.g. Solomon or Gilgamesh) or vision (e.g. via oneiromancy).

== Study ==
Study of the concept was introduced by Sir James George Frazer in his influential book &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; (1890–1915); sacral kingship plays a role in Romanticism and Esotericism (e.g. Julius Evola) and some currents of Neopaganism (Theodism).
The school of Pan-Babylonianism derived much of the religion described in the Hebrew Bible from cults of sacral kingship in ancient Babylonia.

The so-called British and Scandinavian cult-historical schools maintained that the king personified a god and stood at the center of the national or tribal religion. The English &quot;myth and ritual school&quot; concentrated on anthropology and folklore, while the Scandinavian &quot;Uppsala school&quot; emphasized Semitological study.

=== Frazer&#x27;s interpretation ===
A sacred king, according to the systematic interpretation of mythology developed by Frazer in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; (published 1890), was a king who represented a solar deity in a periodically re-enacted fertility rite. Frazer seized upon the notion of a substitute king and made him the keystone of his theory of a universal, pan-European, and indeed worldwide fertility myth, in which a consort for the Goddess was annually replaced. According to Frazer, the sacred king represented the spirit of vegetation, a divine John Barleycorn. He came into being in the spring, reigned during the summer, and ritually died at harvest time, only to be reborn at the winter solstice to wax and rule again. The spirit of vegetation was therefore a &quot;dying and reviving god&quot;. Osiris, Dionysus, Attis and many other familiar figures from Greek mythology and classical antiquity were re-interpreted in this mold (Osiris in particular is conspicuous in this as he was a figure of Egyptian mythology). The sacred king, the human embodiment of the dying and reviving vegetation god, was supposed to have originally been an individual chosen to rule for a time, but whose fate was to suffer as a sacrifice, to be offered back to the earth so that a new king could rule for a time in his stead.

Especially in Europe during Frazer&#x27;s early twentieth century heyday, it launched a cottage industry of amateurs looking for &quot;pagan survivals&quot; in such things as traditional fairs, maypoles, and folk arts like morris dancing. It was widely influential in literature, being alluded to by D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce, Ezra Pound, and in T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, among other works.

Robert Graves used Frazer&#x27;s work in &quot;The Greek Myths&quot; and made it one of the foundations of his own personal mythology in &quot;The White Goddess&quot;, and in the fictional &quot;Seven Days in New Crete&quot; he depicted a future in which the institution of a sacrificial sacred king is revived. Margaret Murray, the principal theorist of witchcraft as a &quot;pagan survival,&quot; used Frazer&#x27;s work to propose the thesis that many kings of England who died as kings, most notably William Rufus, were secret pagans and witches, whose deaths were the re-enactment of the human sacrifice that stood at the centre of Frazer&#x27;s myth. This idea used by fantasy writer Katherine Kurtz in her novel &quot;Lammas Night&quot;.

== Examples ==
* Chakravartin, a righteous king derived from Indian religious thought.
* Devaraja, cult of divine kings in Southeast Asia.
* Germanic kingship
** Kings in pre-Christian Scandinavia and England claimed descent from gods such as Odin (&quot;House of Wessex&quot;, &quot;House of Knýtlinga&quot;) and Freyr (&quot;Yngling&quot;). Scandinavian kings in pre-Christian times served as priests at sacrifices.
* Holy Roman Emperor
* Imperial cult
* The Omukama of Kitara ruled as a heavenly sovereign.
* The High King of Ireland, according to medieval tradition, married the sovereignty goddess.
* Almamy—derived from al-Imam, meaning &quot;the one leading the prayer&quot; in Arabic—regnal title of theocratic monarchs of Futa Toro, Futa Jallon and West African rulers.
* The Eze Nri, ruler of the defunct Igbo Nri Kingdom in present-day Nigeria. He was addressed as &quot;Igwe,&quot; meaning &quot;heavenly one&quot; in the Igbo language, and has bequeathed his title to the monarch of a contemporary traditional state of the same name.
* The Emperor of Japan is known in Japanese as &quot;Tennō&quot; – &quot;heavenly sovereign&quot;, and was formerly believed to be a living kami.
* The Kende was the sacred king of the Magyars in the 9th century.
* The Khagan (Ashina)
* The Kings of Luba became deities after death.

* The kings of Mapungubwe lived in ritual seclusion and had their actions ritualised, as well as being ritual specialists in rainmaking
* King of Rome
** &quot;Rex Sacrorum&quot;
** &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot; – a title adopted by the papacy
** Roman triumph, according to legend first enacted by Romulus
** Augustus
* Sapa Inca
* Son of Heaven, East Asian title
* Shah and Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist, Islamic concepts in Iran
* The kings of Sparta claimed direct descent from Heracles himself, and served as hereditary priests.
* King of Thailand
* The pre-colonial emperors and kings of the Yoruba people, the Obas, and their contemporary successors
* Madkhalism in Islam

Monarchies carried sacral kingship into the Middle Ages, encouraging the idea of kings installed by the Grace of God. See:
* Capetian Miracle
* Royal touch, supernatural powers attributed to the kings of England and France
* The Serbian Nemanjić dynasty
* The Hungarian House of Árpád (known during the Medieval period as the &quot;dynasty of the Holy King&quot;&#x27;)
* The Prince-Bishops, existing in various European countries in Medieval and later times.

== In fiction ==
Many of Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s novels are recognized as being directly influenced by Frazer, depicting individuals accepting the burden of leadership and the ultimate responsibility of personal sacrifice, including &quot;Sword at Sunset&quot;, &quot;The Mark of the Horse Lord&quot;, and &quot;Sun Horse, Moon Horse&quot;.

In addition to its appearance in her novel &quot;Lammas Night&quot; noted above, Katherine Kurtz also uses the idea of sacred kingship in her novel &quot;The Quest for Saint Camber&quot;.

<text>Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty, also known as the Treaty of San Lorenzo or the Treaty of Madrid, was signed on October 27, 1795, by the United States and Spain.

It defined the border between the United States and Spanish Florida, and guaranteed the United States navigation rights on the Mississippi River. With this agreement, the first phase of the ongoing border dispute between the two nations in this region, commonly called the West Florida Controversy, came to a close.

Thomas Pinckney negotiated the treaty for the United States and Don Manuel de Godoy represented Spain. It was presented to the United States Senate on February 26, 1796, and, after debate, was ratified on March 7, 1796. It was ratified by Spain on April 25, 1796, and ratifications were exchanged on that date. The treaty was proclaimed on August 2, 1796.

==Background==
In 1763, Great Britain established two colonies, East Florida and West Florida, out of territory along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast ceded from France and Spain after the French and Indian War, which formed part of the larger Seven Years&#x27; War. The British received all of Spanish Florida from Spain and received the portion of French Louisiana east of the Mississippi River, New Orleans, from France as well as all of French Louisiana west of the Mississippi that had been secretly given to Spain the previous year. Both East Florida and West Florida were never extensively settled by the British and were ceded to Spain (which ruled both provinces as separate and apart from Louisiana) in the 1783 Treaty of Paris at the end of the American Revolutionary War. When the transaction was made however, the boundaries of West Florida, which had changed while under British sovereignty, were not specified.

In 1763, West Florida&#x27;s northern border was initially set at the 31st parallel north, but it was moved in 1764 to 32° 28′, the junction of the Mississippi River and the Yazoo River and now the location of Vicksburg, Mississippi, to give the West Floridians more territory, including the Natchez District and the Tombigbee District. After reacquiring the colony, Spain insisted that its West Florida claim extended fully to 32° 28′, but the U.S. asserted that the land between 31° and 32° 28′ had always been British territory and so rightfully belonged to the United States.

In 1784, the Spanish closed New Orleans to American goods coming down the Mississippi River. In 1795, the border was settled, and the United States and Spain concluded a trade agreement. New Orleans was reopened, and Americans could transfer goods without paying cargo fees, the right of deposit, when they transferred goods from one ship to another.

==Terms==

===Article II===
The southern boundary of the United States with the Spanish colonies of East Florida and West Florida was established as a line beginning on the Mississippi River at the 31st parallel north, the 1763 line, drawn due east to the middle of the Chattahoochee River, then downstream along the middle of the river to the junction with the Flint River, then due east to the headwaters of the St. Marys River, and then along the middle of the channel to the Atlantic Ocean.

===Article III===
A joint Spanish–American team was stipulated for surveying the boundary line.

===Article IV===
The western boundary of the United States with the Spanish colony of Louisiana was established as the middle of the Mississippi River from the northern boundary of the United States (how far north the Mississippi extended was still unknown) to the 31st degree north latitude, and both Spanish subjects and U.S. citizens would have free navigation along the full length of the Mississippi from its source to the ocean.

===Article V===
The United States and Spain agreed not to incite native tribes to warfare and to promote mutually-beneficial trade relationships by tribes on both sides of the border. Previously, Spain had supplied weapons to local tribes for many years. The agreement put the lands of the Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations of American Indians in the new boundaries of the United States.

===Articles VI and VII===
Spain and the United States also agreed to protect and defend the vessels of the other party anywhere in their jurisdictions and not to detain or embargo each other&#x27;s citizens or vessels.

==Ramifications==
A joint Spanish–American team surveyed the boundary line. Andrew Ellicott served as the head of the U.S. contingent. The region that Spain relinquished its claim by Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty was organized by Congress as Mississippi Territory on April 7, 1798. Natchez was the territory&#x27;s first and only capital.

Grant (1997) argues that the treaty was critical for the emergence of American expansionism, later known as &quot;Manifest destiny,&quot; because control of the Natchez and Tombigbee districts was needed for dominance of the Southwest by the United States. The collapse of Spanish power in the region was inevitable, as Americans poured into the district, and very few Spaniards lived there. Spain gave up the area because of international politics, not local unrest. Spanish rule was accepted by the French and British settlers near Natchez. Relations with the Indians were tranquil. However, with the loss of Natchez, Spain&#x27;s frontier was no longer secure, and the rest of its territory was gradually lost.

Under the secret Third Treaty of San Ildefonso of October 1, 1800, Spanish Louisiana, comprising both the vast territory west of the Mississippi and New Orleans, was formally retroceded to France, but Spain continued to administer it. Again, as in 1783, the boundaries of the territory being exchanged were not specified. As a result, when France and the United States concluded the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, a new dispute, the second phase of the West Florida Controversy, arose.

This time, the disagreement was over whether the portion of West Florida that was first under British and then Spanish control since 1763 (between the Mississippi and Perdido Rivers) was included in the 1801 treaty and thus the Louisiana Purchase. The United States laid claim to the region by asserting it to be included. Spain held that such a claim was baseless. While the politicians squabbled, American and British settlers in the region declared an independent Republic of West Florida in 1810. Its capital was located at St. Francisville. It was quickly annexed by the United States and incorporated into the Territory of Orleans, which joined the Union as the state of Louisiana in 1812. The present-day Louisiana civil parishes (equivalent to counties elsewhere in the United States) which had been part of the former republic are referred to as the &quot;Florida Parishes.&quot;

Also in 1812, the U.S. annexed the Mobile District of West Florida between the Perdido and Pearl Rivers and declared that it had been included in the Louisiana Purchase. Spain disputed that and maintained its claim over the area. The following year, a federal statute was secretly enacted authorizing the president to take full possession of the area with the use of military force as deemed necessary. Accordingly, General James Wilkinson occupied this district with a military contingent. The Spanish colonial commandant offered no resistance. The annexed land was incorporated into the Mississippi Territory and partitioned five years later when the Alabama Territory was established.

In 1819 the United States and Spain negotiated the Adams–Onís Treaty in which Spain ceded all of both West Florida and East Florida into the United States. Since the mid-19th century, the southern (east–west) boundary established by Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty has formed the state line between:

* Florida and Georgia
* Florida and Alabamabetween the Chattahoochee and Perdido Rivers
* Louisiana and Mississippibetween the Pearl and Mississippi Rivers

The line is not a state line between the Pearl and Perdido Rivers to provide Mississippi and Alabama with access to the Gulf of Mexico.

<text>Abu Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni (; ; 973after 1050), known as al-Biruni, was a Khwarazmian Iranian scholar and polymath during the Islamic Golden Age. He has been called variously &quot;Father of Comparative Religion&quot;, &quot;Father of modern geodesy&quot;, Founder of Indology and the first anthropologist.

Al-Biruni was well versed in physics, mathematics, astronomy, and natural sciences, and also distinguished himself as a historian, chronologist, and linguist. He studied almost all the sciences of his day and was rewarded abundantly for his tireless research in many fields of knowledge. Royalty and other powerful elements in society funded al-Biruni&#x27;s research and sought him out with specific projects in mind. Influential in his own right, al-Biruni was himself influenced by the scholars of other nations, such as the Greeks, from whom he took inspiration when he turned to the study of philosophy. A gifted linguist, he was conversant in Khwarezmian, Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit, and also knew Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac. He spent much of his life in Ghazni, then capital of the Ghaznavids, in modern-day central-eastern Afghanistan. In 1017, he travelled to the Indian subcontinent and wrote a treatise on Indian culture entitled (&quot;The History of India&quot;), after exploring the Hindu faith practiced in India. He was, for his time, an admirably impartial writer on the customs and creeds of various nations, his scholarly objectivity earning him the title (&quot;The Master&quot;) in recognition of his remarkable description of early 11th-century India.

== Name ==
Al-Biruni&#x27;s name is derived from the Persian word or (&quot;outskirts&quot;), as he was born in an outlying district of Kath, the capital of the Afrighid kingdom of Khwarazm. The city, now called Beruniy, is part of the autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan in northwest Uzbekistan.

His name was most commonly latinized as &quot;Alberonius&quot;.

== Life ==
Al-Biruni spent the first twenty-five years of his life in Khwarezm where he studied Islamic jurisprudence, theology, grammar, mathematics, astronomy, medicine and philosophy and dabbled not only in the field of physics, but also in those of most of the other sciences. The Iranian Khwarezmian language, which was Biruni&#x27;s mother tongue, survived for several centuries after Islam until the Turkification of the region – at least some of the culture of ancient Khwarezm endured – for it is hard to imagine that the commanding figure of Biruni, a repository of so much knowledge, should have appeared in a cultural vacuum. He was sympathetic to the Afrighids, who were overthrown by the rival dynasty of Ma&#x27;munids in 995. He left his homeland for Bukhara, then under the Samanid ruler Mansur II the son of Nuh II. He corresponded with Avicenna, and there are extant exchanges of views between these two scholars.

In 998, he went to the court of the Ziyarid amir of Tabaristan, Qabus (). There he wrote his first important work, (&quot;The remaining traces of past centuries&quot;, translated as &quot;Chronology of ancient nations&quot; or &quot;Vestiges of the Past&quot;) on historical and scientific chronology, probably around 1000, though he later made some amendments to the book. He also visited the court of the Bavandid ruler Al-Marzuban. Accepting the definite demise of the Afrighids at the hands of the Ma&#x27;munids, he made peace with the latter who then ruled Khwarezm. Their court at Gorganj (also in Khwarezm) was gaining fame for its gathering of brilliant scientists.

In 1017, Mahmud of Ghazni captured Rey. Most scholars, including al-Biruni, were taken to Ghazni, the capital of the Ghaznavid dynasty. Biruni was made court astrologer and accompanied Mahmud on his invasions into India, living there for a few years. He was 44 when he went on the journeys with Mahmud of Ghazni. Biruni became acquainted with all things related to India. During this time he wrote his study of India, finishing it around 1030. Along with his writing, Al-Biruni also made sure to extend his study to sciences while on the expeditions. He sought to find a method to measure the height of the sun, and created a makeshift quadrant for that purpose. Al-Biruni was able to make much progress in his study over the frequent travels that he went on throughout the lands of India.

Belonging to the Sunni Ash&#x27;ari school, al-Biruni nevertheless also associated with Maturidi theologians. He was however, very critical of the Mu&#x27;tazila, particularly criticising al-Jahiz and Zurqan. He also repudiated Avicenna for his views on the eternality of the universe.

== Astronomy ==
Of the 146 books written by al-Bīrūnī, 95 are devoted to astronomy, mathematics, and related subjects like mathematical geography. He lived during the Islamic Golden Age, when the Abbasid Caliphs promoted astronomical research, because such research possessed not only a scientific but also a religious dimension: in Islam worship and prayer require a knowledge of the precise directions of sacred locations, which can be determined accurately only through the use of astronomical data.

In carrying out his research, al-Biruni used a variety of different techniques dependent upon the particular field of study involved.

His major work on astrology is primarily an astronomical and mathematical text; he states: &quot;I have begun with Geometry and proceeded to Arithmetic and the Science of Numbers, then to the structure of the Universe and finally to Judicial Astrology, for no one who is worthy of the style and title of Astrologer who is not thoroughly conversant with these for sciences.&quot; In these earlier chapters he lays the foundations for the final chapter, on astrological prognostication, which he criticises. In a later work, he wrote a refutation of astrology, in contradistinction to the legitimate science of astronomy, for which he expresses wholehearted support. Some suggest that his reasons for refuting astrology relate to the methods used by astrologers being based upon pseudoscience rather than empiricism and also to a conflict between the views of the astrologers and those of the orthodox theologians of Sunni Islam.

He wrote an extensive commentary on Indian astronomy in the mostly translation of Aryabhatta&#x27;s work, in which he claims to have resolved the matter of Earth&#x27;s rotation in a work on astronomy that is no longer extant, his (&quot;&quot;Key to Astronomy&quot;):
[T]he rotation of the earth does in no way impair the value of astronomy, as all appearances of an astronomic character can quite as well be explained according to this theory as to the other. There are, however, other reasons which make it impossible. This question is most difficult to solve. The most prominent of both modern and ancient astronomers have deeply studied the question of the moving of the earth, and tried to refute it. We, too, have composed a book on the subject called &quot;Miftah-ilm-alhai&#x27;a (Key to Astronomy)&quot;, in which we think we have surpassed our predecessors, if not in the words, at all events in the matter.
In his major astronomical work, the &quot;Mas&#x27;ud Canon&quot;, Biruni observed that, contrary to Ptolemy, the Sun&#x27;s apogee (highest point in the heavens) was mobile, not fixed. He wrote a treatise on the astrolabe, describing how to use it to tell the time and as a quadrant for surveying. One particular diagram of an eight-geared device could be considered an ancestor of later Muslim astrolabes and clocks. More recently, Biruni&#x27;s eclipse data was used by Dunthorne in 1749 to help determine the acceleration of the Moon, and his data on equinox times and eclipses was used as part of a study of Earth&#x27;s past rotation.

== Refutation of Eternal Universe ==

Like later adherents of the Ash&#x27;ari school, such as al-Ghazali, al-Biruni is famous for vehemently defending the majority Sunni position that the universe had a beginning, being a strong supporter of creatio ex nihilo, specifically refuting the philosopher Ibn Sina in a multiple letter correspondence. Al-Biruni stated:
He further stated that Aristotle, whose arguments Avicenna uses, contradicted himself when he stated that the universe and matter has a start whilst holding on to the idea that matter is pre-eternal. In his letters to Avicenna, he stated the argument of Aristotle, that there is a change in the creator. He further argued that stating there is a change in the creator would mean there is a change in the effect (meaning the universe has change) and that the universe coming into being after not being is such a change (and so arguing there is no change – no beginning – means Aristotle believes the creator is negated). Al-Biruni was proud of the fact that he followed the textual evidence of the religion without being influenced by Greek philosophers such as Aristotle.

== Physics ==
Al-Biruni contributed to the introduction of the scientific method to medieval mechanics. He developed experimental methods to determine density, using a particular type of hydrostatic balance. Al-Biruni&#x27;s method of using the hydrostatic balance was precise, and he was able to measure the density of many different substances, including precious metals, gems, and even air. He also used this method to determine the radius of the earth, which he did by measuring the angle of elevation of the horizon from the top of a mountain and comparing it to the angle of elevation of the horizon from a nearby plain.

In addition to developing the hydrostatic balance, Al-Biruni also wrote extensively on the topic of density, including the different types of densities and how they are measured. His work on the subject was very influential and was later used by scientists like Galileo and Newton in their own research.

== Geography and geodesy ==
Bīrūnī devised a novel method of determining the Earth&#x27;s radius by means of the observation of the height of a mountain. He carried it out at Nandana in Pind Dadan Khan (present-day Pakistan). He used trigonometry to calculate the radius of the Earth using measurements of the height of a hill and measurement of the dip in the horizon from the top of that hill. His calculated radius for the Earth of 3928.77 miles was 2% higher than the actual mean radius of 3847.80 miles. His estimate was given as 12,803,337 cubits, so the accuracy of his estimate compared to the modern value depends on what conversion is used for cubits. The exact length of a cubit is not clear; with an 18-inch cubit his estimate would be 3,600 miles, whereas with a 22-inch cubit his estimate would be 4,200 miles. One significant problem with this approach is that Al-Biruni was not aware of atmospheric refraction and made no allowance for it. He used a dip angle of 34 arc minutes in his calculations, but refraction can typically alter the measured dip angle by about 1/6, making his calculation only accurate to within about 20% of the true value.
In his &quot;Codex Masudicus&quot; (1037), Al-Biruni theorized the existence of a landmass along the vast ocean between Asia and Europe, or what is today known as the Americas. He argued for its existence on the basis of his accurate estimations of the Earth&#x27;s circumference and Afro-Eurasia&#x27;s size, which he found spanned only two-fifths of the Earth&#x27;s circumference, reasoning that the geological processes that gave rise to Eurasia must surely have given rise to lands in the vast ocean between Asia and Europe. He also theorized that at least some of the unknown landmass would lie within the known latitudes which humans could inhabit, and therefore would be inhabited.

== Pharmacology and mineralogy ==

Biruni wrote a pharmacopoeia, the (&quot;Book on the Pharmacopoeia of Medicine&quot;). It lists synonyms for drug names in Syriac, Persian, Greek, Baluchi, Afghan, Kurdish, and some Indian languages.

He used a hydrostatic balance to determine the density and purity of metals and precious stones. He classified gems by what he considered their primary physical properties, such as specific gravity and hardness, rather than the common practice of the time of classifying them by colour.

== History and chronology ==
Biruni&#x27;s main essay on political history, (&quot;Book of nightly conversation concerning the affairs of Ḵᵛārazm&quot;&quot;) is now known only from quotations in Bayhaqī&#x27;s Tārīkh-e Masʿūdī. In addition to this various discussions of historical events and methodology are found in connection with the lists of kings in his al-Āthār al-bāqiya and in the Qānūn as well as elsewhere in the Āthār, in India, and scattered throughout his other works.
Al-Biruni&#x27;s &quot;Chronology of Ancient Nations&quot; attempted to accurately establish the length of various historical eras.

== History of religions ==

Biruni is widely considered to be one of the most important Muslim authorities on the history of religion. He is known as a pioneer in the field of comparative religion in his study of, among other creeds, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism and Islam. He assumed the superiority of Islam: &quot;We have here given an account of these things in order that the reader may learn by the comparative treatment of the subject how much superior the institutions of Islam are, and how more plainly this contrast brings out all customs and usages, differing from those of Islam, in their essential foulness.&quot; However he was happy on occasion to express admiration for other cultures, and quoted directly from the sacred texts of other religions when reaching his conclusions. He strove to understand them on their own terms rather than trying to prove them wrong. His underlying concept was that all cultures are at least distant relatives of all other cultures because they are all human constructs. &quot;Rather, what Al-Biruni seems to be arguing is that there is a common human element in every culture that makes all cultures distant relatives, however foreign they might seem to one another.&quot;

Al-Biruni divides Hindus into an educated and an uneducated class. He describes the educated as monotheistic, believing that God is one, eternal, and omnipotent and eschewing all forms of idol worship. He recognizes that uneducated Hindus worshiped a multiplicity of idols yet points out that even some Muslims (such as the Jabriyah) have adopted anthropomorphic concepts of God.

== Anthropology ==

Al-Biruni wrote about the peoples, customs and religions of the Indian subcontinent.
According to Akbar S. Ahmed, like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive participant observation with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, presenting his findings with objectivity and neutrality using cross-cultural comparisons.
Akhbar S. Ahmed concluded that Al-Biruni can be considered as the first anthropologist, others, however, have argued that he can hardly be considered an anthropologist in the conventional sense.

== Indology ==

Biruni&#x27;s fame as an Indologist rests primarily on two texts. Biruni wrote an encyclopedic work on India called  (variously translated as &quot;Verifying All That the Indians Recount, the Reasonable and the Unreasonable&quot;, or &quot;The book confirming what pertains to India, whether rational or despicable&quot;, in which he explored nearly every aspect of Indian life. During his journey through India, military and political history were not Biruni&#x27;s main focus: he decided rather to document the civilian and scholarly aspects of Hindu life, examining culture, science, and religion. He explored religion within a rich cultural context. He expressed his objectives with simple eloquence: He also translated the yoga sutras of Indian sage Patanjali with the title :

An example of Biruni&#x27;s analysis is his summary of why many Hindus hate Muslims. Biruni notes in the beginning of his book how the Muslims had a hard time learning about Hindu knowledge and culture. He explains that Hinduism and Islam are totally different from each other. Moreover, Hindus in 11th century India had suffered waves of destructive attacks on many of its cities, and Islamic armies had taken numerous Hindu slaves to Persia, which – claimed Biruni – contributed to Hindus becoming suspicious of all foreigners, not just Muslims. Hindus considered Muslims violent and impure, and did not want to share anything with them. Over time, Biruni won the welcome of Hindu scholars. Al-Biruni collected books and studied with these Hindu scholars to become fluent in Sanskrit, discover and translate into Arabic the mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy and other fields of arts as practiced in 11th-century India. He was inspired by the arguments offered by Indian scholars who believed earth must be globular in shape, which they felt was the only way to fully explain the difference in daylight hours by latitude, seasons and Earth&#x27;s relative positions with Moon and stars. At the same time, Biruni was also critical of Indian scribes, who he believed carelessly corrupted Indian documents while making copies of older documents. He also criticized the Hindus on what he saw them do and not do, for example finding them deficient in curiosity about history and religion.

One of the specific aspects of Hindu life that Biruni studied was the Hindu calendar. His scholarship on the topic exhibited great determination and focus, not to mention the excellence in his approach of the in-depth research he performed. He developed a method for converting the dates of the Hindu calendar to the dates of the three different calendars that were common in the Islamic countries of his time period, the Greek, the Arab/Muslim, and the Persian. Biruni also employed astronomy in the determination of his theories, which were complex mathematical equations and scientific calculation that allows one to convert dates and years between the different calendars.

The book does not limit itself to tedious records of battle because Biruni found the social culture to be more important. The work includes research on a vast array of topics of Indian culture, including descriptions of their traditions and customs. Although he tried to stay away from political and military history, Biruni did indeed record important dates and noted actual sites of where significant battles occurred. Additionally, he chronicled stories of Indian rulers and told of how they ruled over their people with their beneficial actions and acted in the interests of the nation. His details are brief and mostly just list rulers without referring to their real names, and he did not go on about deeds that each one carried out during their reign, which keeps in line with Biruni&#x27;s mission to try to stay away from political histories. Biruni also described the geography of India in his work. He documented different bodies of water and other natural phenomena. These descriptions are useful to today&#x27;s modern historians because they are able to use Biruni&#x27;s scholarship to locate certain destinations in modern-day India. Historians are able to make some matches while also concluding that certain areas seem to have disappeared and been replaced with different cities. Different forts and landmarks were able to be located, legitimizing Biruni&#x27;s contributions with their usefulness to even modern history and archeology.

The dispassionate account of Hinduism given by Biruni was remarkable for its time. He stated that he was fully objective in his writings, remaining unbiased like a proper historian should. Biruni documented everything about India just as it happened. But, he did note how some of the accounts of information that he was given by natives of the land may not have been reliable in terms of complete accuracy, however, he did try to be as honest as possible in his writing. Eduard Sachau compares it to &quot;a magic island of quiet, impartial research in the midst of a world of clashing swords, burning towns, and plundered temples.&quot;
Biruni&#x27;s writing was very poetic, which may diminish some of the historical value of the work for modern times. The lack of description of battle and politics makes those parts of the picture completely lost. However, many have used Biruni&#x27;s work to check facts of history in other works that may have been ambiguous or had their validity questioned.

== Works ==

Most of the works of Al-Biruni are in Arabic although he seemingly wrote the in both Persian and Arabic, showing his mastery over both languages. Bīrūnī&#x27;s catalogue of his own literary production up to his 65th lunar/63rd solar year (the end of 427/1036) lists 103 titles divided into 12 categories: astronomy, mathematical geography, mathematics, astrological aspects and transits, astronomical instruments, chronology, comets, an untitled category, astrology, anecdotes, religion, and books he no longer possesses.

=== Persian work ===
Biruni wrote most of his works in Arabic, the scientific language of his age, but is one of the most important of the early works of science in Persian, and is a rich source for Persian prose and lexicography. The book covers the &quot;Quadrivium&quot; in a detailed and skilled fashion.

== Legacy ==

Following Al-Biruni&#x27;s death, his work was neither built upon or referenced by scholars. Centuries later, his writings about India, which had become of interest to the British Raj, were revisited.

The lunar crater Al-Biruni and the asteroid 9936 Al-Biruni are named in his honour. Biruni Island in Antarctica is named after al-Biruni. In Iran, surveying engineers are celebrated on al-Biruni&#x27;s birthday.

In June 2009, Iran donated a pavilion to the United Nations Office in Vienna—placed in the central Memorial Plaza of the Vienna International Center. Named the Scholars Pavilion, it features the statues of four prominent Iranian scholars: Avicenna, Abu Rayhan Biruni, Zakariya Razi (Rhazes) and Omar Khayyam.

===In popular culture===
A film about the life of Al-Biruni, , was released in the Soviet Union in 1974.

Irrfan Khan portrayed Al-Biruni in the 1988 Doordarshan historical drama &quot;Bharat Ek Khoj&quot;.
He has been portrayed by Cüneyt Uzunlar in the Turkish television series &quot;&quot; on TRT 1.

<text>Angels of Light was an American neofolk band that was formed circa 1998 by singer-songwriter and musician Michael Gira after he disbanded Swans, the group he had founded in 1982. The band has marked a distinctly different style for Gira since he left Swans, most noticeably being musically more melodic and less brutal than his previous efforts and with emphasis on acoustic instruments and folk and country influences. 

Before the band was formed, Gira intended to call his post-Swans acoustic/song-based project The Pleasure Seekers. This name was discarded because there had been a group with the same name in the 1960s. The first two live performances of what would become the Angels of Light (the Tonic/Bowery Ballroom benefit shows) were billed as &quot;Michael Gira with guests&quot;.

The revolving lineup up Angels of Light included a wide range of musicians from New York City and elsewhere, including Dana Schechter of Bee and Flower, Kid Congo Powers of The Cramps, Larry Mullins (a.k.a. Toby Dammit), Cassis Birgit Staudt of b-blush, Bliss Blood of The Moonlighters, Thor Harris of Shearwater, Swans guitarist Kristof Hahn, Phil Puleo of Cop Shoot Cop, and freak-folk musician Devendra Banhart. On &quot;The Angels of Light Sing &#x27;Other People&#x27;&quot; and &quot;We Are Him&quot;, Gira was backed by Brooklyn band Akron/Family. Hahn, Harris and Puleo went on to join Gira in the new Swans lineup assembled in 2010. Shortly thereafter Swans released their first post-reunion LP &quot;My Father Will Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky&quot;.

All Angels of Light albums were released on Michael Gira&#x27;s label Young God Records.

<text>Abū Ḥanīfa Aḥmad ibn Dāwūd Dīnawarī (; died 895) was an Islamic Golden Age polymath: astronomer, agriculturist, botanist, metallurgist, geographer, mathematician, and historian.

== Life ==
Of Persian stock, Dinawari was born in the (now ruined) town of Dinawar in modern-day western Iran. It had some importance due to its geographical location, serving as the entrance to the region of Jibal as well as a crossroad between the culture of Iran and that of the inhabitants on the other side of the Zagros Mountains. The birth date of Dinawari is uncertain; it is likely that he was born during the first or second decade of the 9th-century. He was instructed in the two main traditions of the Abbasid-era grammarians of al-Baṣrah and of al-Kūfah. His principal teachers were Ibn al-Sikkīt and his own father. He studied grammar, philology, geometry, arithmetic, and astronomy and was known to be a reliable traditionalist. His most renowned contribution is the &quot;Book of Plants&quot;, for which he is considered the founder of Arabic botany.

Dinawari&#x27;s &quot;Kitāb al-akhbār al-ṭiwāl (General History)&quot;, written from a Persian point of view, is possibly the earliest apparent effort to combine Iranian and Islamic history. While historians such as al-Tabari and Bal&#x27;ami devoted the introduction of their work to long discourses on the duration of the world, Dinawari attempted to establish the importance of &quot;Iranshahr&quot; (&quot;land of Iran&quot;) as the centre of the world. In his work, Dinawari notably devoted much less space to the Islamic prophet Muhammad compared to that of Iran. Regardless, Dinawari was a devoted Muslim, as indicated by his commentary on the Qur&#x27;an. He concluded the history with the suppression of Babak Khorramdin&#x27;s rebellion in 837, and the subsequent execution of the Iranian general Khaydhar ibn Kawus al-Afshin.

Besides having access to early Arabic sources, Dinawari also made use of Persian sources, including pre-Islamic epic romances. Fully acquainted with the Persian language, Dinawari occasionally inserted phrases from the language into his work.

Dinawari&#x27;s spiritual successor was Hamza al-Isfahani (died after 961).

==Works==
The tenth century biographical encyclopaedia, &quot;al-Fihrist&quot; written by Al-Nadim, lists sixteen book titles by Dinawari:

==Editions &amp; translations==
Dinawari&#x27;s &quot;General History&quot; (Al-Akhbar al-Tiwal) has been edited and published numerous times (Vladimir Guirgass, 1888; Muhammad Sa&#x27;id Rafi&#x27;i, 1911; Ignace Krachkovsky, 1912; &#x27;Abd al-Munim &#x27;Amir &amp; Jamal al-din Shayyal, 1960; Isam Muhammad al-Hajj &#x27;Ali, 2001), but has not been translated in its entirety into a European language. Jackson Bonner has recently prepared an English translation of the pre-Islamic passages of al-Akhbar al-Tiwal.

==&quot;Book of Plants&quot;==
Al-Dinawari is considered the founder of Arabic botany for his &quot;Kitab al-Nabat&quot; (&quot;Book of Plants&quot;), which consisted of six volumes. Only the third and fifth volumes have survived, though the sixth volume has partly been reconstructed based on citations from later works. In the surviving portions of his works, 637 plants are described from the letters &quot;sin&quot; to &quot;ya&quot;. He describes the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit.

The first part of the &quot;Book of Plants&quot; describes astronomical and meteorological concepts as they relate to plants, including the planets and constellations, the sun and moon, the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain, &quot;anwa&quot;, and atmospheric phenomena such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, and floods. The book also describes different types of ground, indicating which types are more convenient for plants and the qualities and properties of good ground.

Al-Dinawari quoted from other early Muslim botanical works that are now lost, such as those of al-Shaybani, Ibn al-Arabi, al-Bahili, and Ibn as-Sikkit.

<text>A madhhab (, , pl. , ) refers to any school of thought within Islamic jurisprudence. The major Sunni &quot;madhāhib&quot; are Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali. They emerged in the ninth and tenth centuries CE and by the twelfth century almost all jurists aligned themselves with a particular &quot;madhab&quot;. These four schools recognize each other&#x27;s validity and they have interacted in legal debate over the centuries. Rulings of these schools are followed across the Muslim world without exclusive regional restrictions, but they each came to dominate in different parts of the world. For example, the Maliki school is predominant in North and West Africa; the Hanafi school in South and Central Asia; the Shafi&#x27;i school in East Africa and Southeast Asia; and the Hanbali school in North and Central Arabia. The first centuries of Islam also witnessed a number of short-lived Sunni &quot;madhhabs&quot;. The Zahiri school, which is considered to be endangered, continues to exert influence over legal thought. The development of Shia legal schools occurred along the lines of theological differences and resulted in the formation of the Ja&#x27;fari madhhab amongst Twelver Shias, as well as the Isma&#x27;ili and Zaidi &quot;madhhabs&quot; amongst Isma&#x27;ilis and Zaidis respectively, whose differences from Sunni legal schools are roughly of the same order as the differences among Sunni schools. The Ibadi legal school, distinct from Sunni and Shia &quot;madhhabs&quot;, is predominant in Oman. Unlike Sunnis, Shias, and Ibadis, non-denominational Muslims are not affiliated with any &quot;madhhab&quot;.

The transformations of Islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the &quot;madhhab&quot; system. With the spread of codified state laws in the Muslim world, the influence of the &quot;madhhabs&quot; beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system. State law codification commonly drew on rulings from multiple &quot;madhhabs&quot;, and legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional &quot;ulama&quot; as interpreters of the resulting laws. In the 20th century, some Islamic jurists began to assert their intellectual independence from traditional &quot;madhhabs&quot;. With the spread of Salafi influence and reformist currents in the 20th century; a handful of Salafi scholars have asserted independence from being strictly bound by the traditional legal mechanisms of the four schools. Nevertheless, the majority of Sunni scholarship continues to uphold post-classical creedal belief in rigorously adhering (&quot;Taqlid&quot;) to one of the four schools in all legal details.

The Amman Message, which was endorsed in 2005 by prominent Islamic scholars around the world, recognized four Sunni schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i, Hanbali), two Shia schools (Ja&#x27;fari, Zaidi), the Ibadi school and the Zahiri school. Schools of Islamic jurisprudence are located in Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Egypt, Turkey, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Russia, China, the Philippines, Algeria, Libya, Saudi Arabia and multiple other countries.

== &quot;Ancient&quot; schools ==
According to John Burton, &quot;modern research shows&quot; that fiqh was first &quot;regionally organized&quot; with &quot;considerable disagreement and variety of view.&quot; In the second century of Islam, schools of fiqh were noted for the loyalty of their jurists to the legal practices of their local communities, whether Mecca, Kufa, Basra, Syria, etc. (Egypt&#x27;s school in Fustat was a branch of Medina&#x27;s school of law and followed such practices—up until the end of the 8th century—as basing verdict on one single witness (not two) and the oath of the claimant. Its principal jurist in the second half of the 8th century was al-Layth b. Sa&#x27;d.) Al-Shafiʽi wrote that, &quot;every capital of the Muslims is a seat of learning whose people follow the opinion of one of their countrymen in most of his teachings&quot;. The &quot;real basis&quot; of legal doctrine in these &quot;ancient schools&quot; was not a body of reports of Muhammad&#x27;s sayings, doings, silent approval (the ahadith) or even those of his Companions, but the &quot;living tradition&quot; of the school as &quot;expressed in the consensus of the scholars&quot;, according to Joseph Schacht.

== Al-Shafi‘i and after ==
It has been asserted that &quot;madhahib&quot; were consolidated in the 9th and 10th centuries as a means of excluding dogmatic theologians, government officials and non-Sunni sects from religious discourse. Historians have differed regarding the times at which the various schools emerged. One interpretation is that Sunni Islam was initially split into four groups: the Hanafites, Malikites, Shafi&#x27;ites and Zahirites. Later, the Hanbalites and Jarirites developed two more schools; then various dynasties effected the eventual exclusion of the Jarirites; eventually, the Zahirites were also excluded when the Mamluk Sultanate established a total of four independent judicial positions, thus solidifying the Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali schools. During the era of the Islamic Gunpowders, the Ottoman Empire reaffirmed the official status of these four schools as a reaction to Shi&#x27;ite Persia. Some are of the view that Sunni jurisprudence falls into two groups: &quot;Ahl al-Ra&#x27;i&quot; (&quot;people of opinions&quot;, emphasizing scholarly judgment and reason) and &quot;Ahl al-Hadith&quot; (&quot;people of traditions&quot;, emphasizing strict interpretation of scripture).

10th century Shi&#x27;ite scholar Ibn al-Nadim named eight groups: Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi&#x27;i, Zahiri, Imami Shi&#x27;ite, Ahl al-Hadith, Jariri and Kharijite. Abu Thawr also had a school named after him. In the 12th century Jariri and Zahiri schools were absorbed by the Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali schools respectively. Ibn Khaldun defined only three Sunni &quot;madhahib&quot;: Hanafi, Zahiri, and one encompassing the Shafi&#x27;i, Maliki and Hanbali schools as existing initially, noting that by the 14th-century historian the Zahiri school had become extinct, only for it to be revived again in parts of the Muslim world by the mid-20th century.

Historically, the &quot;fiqh&quot; schools were often in political and academic conflict with one another, vying for favor with the ruling government in order to have their representatives appointed to legislative and especially judiciary positions.

== Modern era ==

The transformations of Islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the &quot;madhhab&quot; system. Legal practice in most of the Muslim world has come to be controlled by government policy and state law, so that the influence of the &quot;madhhabs&quot; beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system. State law codification commonly utilized the methods of &quot;takhayyur&quot; (selection of rulings without restriction to a particular &quot;madhhab&quot;) and &quot;talfiq&quot; (combining parts of different rulings on the same question). Legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional ulema as interpreters of the resulting laws. Global Islamic movements have at times drawn on different &quot;madhhabs&quot; and at other times placed greater focus on the scriptural sources rather than classical jurisprudence. The Hanbali school, with its particularly strict adherence to the Quran and hadith, has inspired conservative currents of direct scriptural interpretation. In the 20th century many Islamic jurists began to assert their intellectual independence from traditional schools of jurisprudence. Examples of the latter approach include networks of Indonesian ulema and Islamic scholars residing in Muslim-minority countries, who have advanced liberal interpretations of Islamic law.

==Schools==
Generally, Sunnis will follow one particular &quot;madhhab&quot; which varies from region to region, but also believe that &quot;ijtihad&quot; must be exercised by the contemporary scholars capable of doing so. Most rely on &quot;taqlid&quot;, or acceptance of religious rulings and epistemology from a higher religious authority in deferring meanings of analysis and derivation of legal practices instead of relying on subjective readings.

Experts and scholars of &quot;fiqh&quot; follow the &quot;usul&quot; (principles) of their own &quot;madhhab&quot;, but they also study the &quot;usul&quot;, evidences, and opinions of other &quot;madhahib&quot;.

=== Sunni ===
The four main schools of jurisprudence of Sunni Islam are the Hanafi, Shafi&#x27;i, Maliki and Hanbali schools. There&#x27;s also the Zahiri school but it is not significant. Historically, there were other schools of jurisprudence but they became extinct which include the Jariri, Awza&#x27;i, Laythi, Thawri and Qurtubi schools. The reason for the survival and dominance of the main schools was because of a number of factors including state support for specific scholars, dominance in debates and student numbers. Sunni schools take their name from the classical jurist who founded them.

==== Hanafi ====
The Hanafi school was founded by Abu Hanifa. It is primarily found in the Levant, South Asia, Central Asia, Turkey, the Balkans, Iraq, Trinidad, Guyana and Suriname. The order of priority for deducing law by the Hanafi school is:

# Quran
# Sunnah
# Ijma of the Sahaba
# Individual opinions of the Sahaba
# Qiyas
# Istihsan
# Urf

==== Maliki ====
The Maliki school was founded by Malik ibn Anas. It is primarily found in North Africa, West Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait. Historically, it was also followed by Muslims inhabiting parts of Europe under Islamic rule specifically Al-Andalus and Sicily. The order of priority for deducing law by the Maliki school is:

# Quran
# Sunnah, a hadith would be rejected if it contradicted the practice of the people of Medina
# ʻAmal, the practice of the people of Medina
# Ijma of the Sahaba
# Individual opinion of the Sahaba
# Qiyas
# Isolated customs and practices of pockets of Medinans were also given some weight
# Istislah
# Urf

=== Shafi&#x27;i ===
The Shafi&#x27;i school was founded by Al-Shafi&#x27;i. It is primarily found in East Africa, Yemen, South East Asia, Jordan, Palestine, Kurdistan, Sri Lanka and parts of India. The order of priority for deducing law by the Shafi&#x27;i school is:

# Quran
# Sunnah
# Ijma
# Individual opinions of the Sahaba
# Qiyas

==== Hanbali ====
The Hanbali school was founded by Ahmad ibn Hanbal. It is primarily found in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and minority communities in Syria and Iraq. The order of priority for deducing law by the Hanbali school is:

# Quran
# Sunnah
# Ijma of the Sahaba, but not the ijma after that period
# Individual opinions of the Sahaba
# Weak hadith unless its weakness is attributed to transmission by degenerates or liars
# Qiyas

=== Shia ===
The Twelver school of jurisprudence is known as the Ja&#x27;fari school. The other two schools are the Zaydi and Ismaili schools.

==== Ja&#x27;fari ====
The Ja&#x27;fari school was named after the sixth Imam, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq. The order of priority for deducing law by the Ja&#x27;fari school is:

# Quran
# Sunnah
# Ijtihad of the Imam

<text>Badīʿ az-Zaman Abu l-ʿIzz ibn Ismāʿīl ibn ar-Razāz al-Jazarī (1136–1206, , ) was a Muslim polymath: a scholar, inventor, mechanical engineer, artisan and artist from the Artuqid Dynasty of Jazira in Mesopotamia. He is best known for writing &quot;The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices&quot; (, also known as &quot;Automata&quot;) in 1206, where he described 50 mechanical devices, along with instructions on how to construct them. One of his more famous inventions is the elephant clock. He has been described as the &quot;father of robotics&quot; and modern day engineering.

==Biography==
Al-Jazari was born in the area of Upper Mesopotamia in 1136. Sources state his exact location is unknown, but they speculate he could have been born in Jazirat ibn Umar, where he got the name Jazari from or Al-Jazira which was used to denote Upper Mesopotamia. The only biographical information known about him is contained in his &quot;Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices&quot;. Like his father before him, he served as chief engineer at the Artuklu Palace, the residence of the Mardin branch of the Artuqids which ruled across Upper Mesopotamia as vassals of the Zengid dynasty of Mosul and later of Ayyubid general Saladin. Little is known about his ethnic background, so he has been variously described as Arab, Kurdish or Persian.

Al-Jazari was part of a tradition of artisans and was thus more a practical engineer than an inventor who appears to have been &quot;more interested in the craftsmanship necessary to construct the devices than in the technology which lay behind them&quot; and his machines were usually &quot;assembled by trial and error rather than by theoretical calculation&quot;. His &quot;Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices&quot; appears to have been quite popular as it appears in a large number of manuscript copies, and as he explains repeatedly, he only describes devices he has built himself. According to Mayr, the book&#x27;s style resembles that of a modern &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; book.

Some of his devices were inspired by earlier devices, such as one of his monumental water clocks, which was based on that of a Pseudo-Archimedes. He also cites the influence of the Banū Mūsā brothers for his fountains, al-Saghani for the design of a candle clock, and Hibatullah ibn al-Husayn (d. 1139) for musical automata. Al-Jazari goes on to describe the improvements he made to the work of his predecessors, and describes a number of devices, techniques and components that are original innovations which do not appear in the works by his precessors.

==1206 edition (Ahmet III 3472)==
The Artuqid ruler Nasr al-Din Mahmud (r. 1201–1222) is known to have commissioned the first edition of &quot;Al-Jāmi‘ fī ṣinā‘at al-ḥiyal&quot; of Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari, in April 1206 at the Artuqid court. This manuscript is known as Ahmet III 3472, now in the Topkapı Sarayı Library. The miniatures are thought to reflect various aspects of the Artuqid court at the time. Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari was employed at the Artuqid court during the last quarter of the 12th century, and this is the earliest known manuscript of his opus.

==Mechanisms and methods==
The most significant aspect of al-Jazari&#x27;s machines are the mechanisms, components, ideas, methods, and design features which they employ.

===Camshaft===
A camshaft, a shaft to which cams are attached, was described in 1206 by al-Jazari, who employed them in his automata, water clocks (such as the candle clock) and water-raising machines.

===Crankshaft and crank-slider mechanism===
The eccentrically mounted handle of the rotary quern-stone in fifth century BCE Spain that spread across the Roman Empire constitutes a crank. The earliest evidence of a crank and connecting rod mechanism dates to the 3rd century AD Hierapolis sawmill in the Roman Empire. The crank also appears in the mid-9th century in several of the hydraulic devices described by the Banū Mūsā brothers in their &quot;Book of Ingenious Devices&quot;.

In 1206, al-Jazari invented an early crankshaft, which he incorporated with a crank-connecting rod mechanism in his twin-cylinder pump. Like the modern crankshaft, al-Jazari&#x27;s mechanism consisted of a wheel setting several crankpins into motion, with the wheel&#x27;s motion being circular and the pins moving back-and-forth in a straight line. The crankshaft described by al-Jazari transforms continuous rotary motion into a linear reciprocating motion, and is central to modern machinery such as the steam engine, internal combustion engine and automatic controls.

He used the crankshaft with a connecting rod in two of his water-raising machines: the crank-driven saqiya chain pump and the double-action reciprocating piston suction pump. His water pump also employed the first known crank-slider mechanism.

===Design and construction methods===
English technology historian Donald Hill writes:

===Escapement mechanism in a rotating wheel===
Al-Jazari invented a method for controlling the speed of rotation of a wheel using an escapement mechanism.

===Mechanical controls===
According to Donald Hill, al-Jazari described several early mechanical controls, including &quot;a large metal door, a combination lock and a lock with four bolts&quot;.

=== Conical valve and segmental gear ===
A segmental gear is &quot;a piece for receiving or communicating reciprocating motion from or to a cogwheel, consisting of a sector of a circular gear, or ring, having cogs on the periphery, or face.&quot; Lynn Townsend White wrote:
==Water-raising machines==

Al-Jazari invented five machines for raising water, as well as watermills and water wheels with cams on their axle used to operate automata, in the 12th and 13th centuries, and described them in 1206. It was in these water-raising machines that he introduced his most important ideas and components.

===Saqiya chain pumps===
The first known use of a crankshaft in a chain pump was in one of al-Jazari&#x27;s saqiya machines. The concept of minimizing intermittent working is also first implied in one of al-Jazari&#x27;s &quot;saqiya&quot; chain pumps, which was for the purpose of maximising the efficiency of the saqiya chain pump. Al-Jazari also constructed a water-raising saqiya chain pump which was run by hydropower rather than manual labour, though the Chinese were also using hydropower for chain pumps prior to him. Saqiya machines like the ones he described have been supplying water in Damascus since the 13th century up until modern times, and were in everyday use throughout the medieval Islamic world.
Interestingly, the depiction of the chain in al-Jazari&#x27;s pump appears to be in the form of a Möbius strip, from long before the Möbius strip was first identified as an object of study in mathematics.

===Double-action suction pump with valves and reciprocating piston motion===
Al-Jazari described suction pipes, suction pump, double-action pump, and made early uses of valves and a crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism, when he developed a twin-cylinder reciprocating piston suction pump. This pump is driven by a water wheel, which drives, through a system of gears, an oscillating slot-rod to which the rods of two pistons are attached. The pistons work in horizontally opposed cylinders, each provided with valve-operated suction and delivery pipes. The delivery pipes are joined above the centre of the machine to form a single outlet into the irrigation system. This water-raising machine had a direct significance for the development of modern engineering. This pump is remarkable for three reasons:
*The first known use of a true suction pipe (which sucks fluids into a partial vacuum) in a pump.
*The first application of the double-acting principle.
*The conversion of rotary to reciprocating motion via the crank-connecting rod mechanism.

Al-Jazari&#x27;s suction piston pump could lift 13.6 metres of water, with the help of delivery pipes. It was not, however, any more efficient than the noria commonly used by the Muslim world at the time.

Al-Jazari cited the Byzantine siphon used for discharging Greek fire as an inspiration for his pump. According to Donald Hill, al-Jazari&#x27;s pump can be considered &quot;a direct ancestor of the steam engine combination&quot;. According to Joseph Needham, al-Jazari&#x27;s slot-rod force pump is one of &quot;the two machines of the Middle Ages which lie most directly in the line of ancestry of the steam-engine and the locomotive&quot; along with Wang Zhen&#x27;s blowing engine a century later.

=== Single-bucket and four-bucket water lifting machines ===
Al-Jazari described single-bucket and four-bucket water lifting machines. The single-bucket version employs differentials, semi-circular gear units, bucket elevators, and gearboxes, while the four-bucket version adds a mechanical timer.

===Water supply system===
Al-Jazari developed the earliest water supply system to be driven by gears and hydropower, which was built in 13th century Damascus to supply water to its mosques and Bimaristan hospitals. The system had water from a lake turn a scoop-wheel and a system of gears which transported jars of water up to a water channel that led to mosques and hospitals in the city.

==Automata==
Al-Jazari built automated moving peacocks driven by hydropower. He also created automatic doors as part of one of his elaborate water clocks, and invented water wheels with cams on their axle used to operate automata. According to &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, the Italian Renaissance inventor Leonardo da Vinci may have been influenced by the classic automata of al-Jazari.

Mark E. Rosheim summarizes the advances in robotics made by Muslim engineers, especially al-Jazari, as follows:

===Drink-serving waitress===
One of al-Jazari&#x27;s humanoid automata was a waitress that could serve water, tea or drinks. The drink was stored in a tank with a reservoir from where the drink drips into a bucket and, after seven minutes, into a cup, after which the waitress appears out of an automatic door serving the drink.

===Hand-washing automaton with flush mechanism===
Al-Jazari invented a hand washing automaton incorporating a flush mechanism now used in modern flush toilets. This device is another example of humanoid automata. It consisted of a human figure, made from jointed copper, holding a pitcher resembling a peacock in its right hand. The pitcher is made from brass and holds within it a chamber, divided into two parts by a metal plate. This mechanism aided the pouring of the water from the spout so that it was smooth and would not splutter. The reservoir in which the water is held is situated within the right-hand side of the human figure. An axle is fitted into the right elbow of the human figure so as to allow the liquid to pour from the reservoir through the spout of the pitcher. The left arm of the figure had a fixed weight which would raise and lower the arm which would hold a towel, comb and mirror.

This automaton was designed to aid the king whilst he performed his ritual ablutions. A servant of the king would carry the figure and place it next to a basin that could hold liquid. The servant then turned a knob on the back of the figure which opened a valve resulting in the pouring of water from the right hand of the figure into the basin. When the reservoir is nearly empty and most of the water has been poured a mechanism is prompted and the left hand of the figure, holding the towel, comb and mirror, is extended out in the direction of the king so that he can dry himself and tend to his beard.

===Peacock fountain with automated servants===
Water and its usages holds particular importance in Islam; both as being an integral part of the pre-prayer washing processes &quot;wudu&quot; and &quot;ghusl&quot;, and a key feature in Islamic gardens – four fountains featuring in the Paradise Garden; the Islamic final resting place referenced in the Quran. Additionally, with Mesopotamia being a naturally drought-ridden place, machines relating to water held a significant function; in both a divine and practical sense.

An entire section of &quot;The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices&quot; was devoted to fountain mechanisms, titled: &quot;‘On the construction in pools of fountains which change their shape, and of machines for the perpetual flute’.&quot;

Al-Jazari&#x27;s &quot;peacock fountain&quot; was a more sophisticated hand washing device featuring humanoid automata as servants which offer soap and towels. Mark E. Rosheim describes it as follows:

The basin of the &quot;peacock fountain&quot; formed the basin for performing &quot;wudu&quot;, and it would have been operated by a servant, who would have pulled the plug and positioned the peacock&#x27;s beak; allowing the mechanism to release the water into the basin in front of the user.

However, whilst water moving objects such as the peacock fountain had ritualistic usage, there is suggestion that water-moving hydraulics were put to profane use. Ayhan Aytes suggests that:Many of the devices also had additional functions that contradicted divine omnipotence. The most profane purpose of several of his hydraulic and pnuematic automata was to get guests at parties drunk as quickly as possible.

===Musical robot band===
Al-Jazari&#x27;s work described fountains and musical automata, in which the flow of water alternated from one large tank to another at hourly or half-hourly intervals. This operation was achieved through his innovative use of hydraulic switching.

Al-Jazari created a musical automaton, which was a boat with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties. Professor Noel Sharkey has argued that it is quite likely that it was an early programmable automata and has produced a possible reconstruction of the mechanism; it has a programmable drum machine with (cams) that bump into little levers that operated the percussion. The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around.

===The water-clock of the drummers===
The water-clock of the drummers, which differs from the Musical robot band in that it lacks a flute-playing doll and instead has two trumpeters, consists of seven wood-jointed male figures, including the aforementioned trumpeters as well as two dolls playing cymbals and the rest playing other percussive instruments. The mechanism in this specific automaton serves as a clock by producing a musical output once every hour, illustrating Al-Jazari&#x27;s ability to create multi-faceted automata that functioned on a practical and entertainment level. The motion of the automaton is initiated at daybreak by another male doll, who stands at the edge of the frieze element of the design, moving across until he reaches a specific point at which a carved falcon leans forward dropping a ball from its beak onto a cymbal. All mechanical aspects of the automaton are then driven by water and a series of pistons and cables. Each hour water drains out of the main cistern to cause another bucket to tip over driving a water wheel that is connected to the musicians. The automaton is described to ‘perform a with a clamorous sound which is heard from afar’ and could play several different tunes. Like many other automatons by Al-Jazari, this was created to entertain guests at the royal palace.

==Clocks==
Al-Jazari constructed a variety of water clocks and candle clocks. These included a portable water-powered scribe clock, which was a meter high and half a meter wide, reconstructed successfully at the Science Museum in 1976 Al-Jazari also invented monumental water-powered astronomical clocks which displayed moving models of the Sun, Moon, and stars.

===Candle clocks===

According to Donald Hill, al-Jazari constructed the most sophisticated candle clocks known to date. Hill described one of al-Jazari&#x27;s candle clocks as follows:

Al-Jazari&#x27;s candle clock also included a dial to display the time and, for the first time, employed a bayonet fitting, a fastening mechanism still used in modern times.

===Elephant clock===
The elephant clock described by al-Jazari in 1206 is notable for several innovations. It was the first clock in which an automaton reacted after certain intervals of time (in this case, a humanoid robot striking the cymbal and a mechanical robotic bird chirping) and the first water clock to accurately record the passage of the temporal hours to match the uneven length of days throughout the year.

===Castle clock===

Al-Jazari&#x27;s largest astronomical clock was the &quot;castle clock&quot;, which was a complex device that was about high, and had multiple functions besides timekeeping. It included a display of the zodiac and the solar and lunar orbits, and an innovative feature of the device was a pointer in the shape of the crescent moon which travelled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart, and caused automatic doors to open, each revealing a mannequin, every hour.

Another feature of the device was five automata musicians who automatically play music when moved by levers operated by a hidden camshaft attached to a water wheel.

Al-Jazari invented water clocks that were driven by both water and weights. These included geared clocks and a portable water-powered scribe clock, which was a meter high and half a meter wide. The scribe with his pen was synonymous to the hour hand of a modern clock. Al-Jazari&#x27;s famous water-powered scribe clock was reconstructed successfully at the Science Museum, London in 1976.

==Miniature paintings==
Alongside his accomplishments as an inventor and engineer, al-Jazari was also an accomplished artist. In &quot;The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices&quot;, he gave instructions of his inventions and illustrated them using miniature paintings, a medieval style of Islamic art.

<text>RFA &quot;Sir Percivale&quot; (L3036) was a Round Table class landing ship logistics (LSL) vessel belonging to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary of the United Kingdom.

&quot;Sir Percivale&quot; took part in the Falklands War and the 1991 Gulf War.

==Background==

She originally entered British Army service in 1968, managed for the Ministry of Transport by British India Steam Navigation Company, but was taken over by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary along with the other members of the class in 1970.

==Operational history==

===Falklands War===

The first twelve years of the ship&#x27;s life were quiet, with some time spent in the Pacific, until the Falklands War broke out in April 1982. Along with all the Navy&#x27;s other amphibious assault shipping, &quot;Sir Percivale&quot; went south to participate in the recapture of the Falkland Islands. At this time, all the RFA ships were crewed by Hong Kong Chinese civilian sailors. She pioneered the supply runs to Teal Inlet and was the first British ship to re-enter Stanley Harbour. Unlike the &quot;Sir Galahad&quot;, &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; and &quot;Sir Lancelot&quot;, the ship emerged unscathed from the conflict.

===1991-1999===

The ship served in the Gulf War in 1991 and twice deployed to the Adriatic to support British operations in the Balkans.

In 1996 &quot;Sir Percivale&quot; took part in combined exercises with Jordan, followed by Green Wader 96, the first exercise of the then newly formed Amphibious Squadron of the Joint Rapid Deployment Force. In 1997, the ship took part in the large Ocean Wave 97 deployment to the far east and was present for the handover of Hong Kong to the Chinese. Following this ceremony, &quot;Sir Percivale&quot; escorted the ships of the former Hong Kong Squadron (3 Peacock class patrol vessel) to their new owners in the Philippines. During other parts of Ocean Wave, the ship took Royal Marines to Brunei, Singapore and Thailand for various exercises. 1998 saw further exercises as &quot;Sir Percivale&quot; took part in practice amphibious assaults in Norway, France and Spain.

===2000-2004===

In 2000, &quot;Sir Percivale&quot; was deployed to Sierra Leone to support British forces training the army of that country. In September 2000, the ship was alongside in Freetown when British forces who had been taken hostage were rescued in a raid by the Parachute Regiment and the SAS (&quot;Operation Barras&quot;). Since then the ship has been deployed during operations connected with Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003.

The ship was to have a SLEP overhaul, but an equivalent overhaul of &quot;Sir Bedivere&quot; proved so costly that plans were abandoned and new ships were procured instead.

&quot;Sir Percivale&quot; was decommissioned on 17 August 2004 and was laid up alongside at Marchwood Military Port, Southampton.

The ship was sold to Leavesley International and scrapping commenced in Canada Dock, Liverpool on 16 December 2009.

<text>TV &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; (L3505) formerly RFA &quot;Sir Tristram&quot;, is a that was converted to a Special Forces Training Vessel in 2008. She was launched in 1966, and accepted into British Army service in 1967. As with others of her class, she was transferred to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in 1970, and was crewed by British officers and Hong Kong Chinese sailors. The ship saw service in the Falklands War of 1982, and was badly damaged at Fitzroy on 8 June.

==Early service==
From completion to early 1970 &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; was managed by British India Steam Navigation Company. In January 1972 &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; was part of an anti-invasion task force off British Honduras, together with , and . In 1977 &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; was used as a guest ship for the Queens Silver Jubilee Fleet Review at Spithead in the Solent.

===Falklands War===

In April 1982 &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; was diverted from Belize to the Falkland Islands to take part in Operation Corporate, the British effort to retake the Falkland Islands.

On 8 June, while transporting men and equipment to Fitzroy Cove alongside the , &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; was attacked by Douglas A-4 Skyhawks of the Argentine Air Force&#x27;s V &quot;Brigada Aérea&quot; (&quot;FAA&quot;), each loaded with three Mark 82 bombs. At approximately 14:00 local time the decks were strafed and two crew were killed. A 500 lb bomb penetrated the deck, but failed to explode immediately, allowing the remaining crew to be evacuated. Following the later explosion, &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; was abandoned. Immediately following the end of the conflict, &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; was towed to Port Stanley, where she was used as an accommodation ship. &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; then returned to the United Kingdom in 1983 on a heavy lift ship and was extensively rebuilt.

== Rebuilt==

Following the rebuild, &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; re-entered active service in 1985, and saw service in the Gulf War, and the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. The ship supported relief operations for Hurricane Mitch off Central America. In 2000 the ship was deployed to Sierra Leone in support of British operations there, followed by a cruise to the Baltic Sea in support of mine countermeasure vessels. In early 2001 &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; returned to Sierra Leone to take over from as the ship supporting British forces ashore there. In 2003 the ship was deployed as part of the largest British fleet for 20 years in support of the invasion of Iraq.

The ship was decommissioned on 17 December 2005 but continues to be used for training purposes by the Special Boat Service and other elements of the UK Special Forces group. She is now based at Portland Harbour.

<text>John X of Constantinople (&quot;John Kamateros&quot; ; died May 1206) was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 5 August 1198 to May 1206.

== Life ==
John was a member of the Kamateros family to which belonged the Empress Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera, wife of Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195–1203). An educated man, well versed in classical literature, rhetoric and philosophy, he occupied a series of ecclesiastical posts reaching the post of &quot;chartophylax&quot;, which he held at the time of his elevation to the patriarchal throne.

In 1198–1200, he had an exchange of letters with Pope Innocent III on the issue of papal supremacy and the &quot;Filioque&quot; clause. He disputed Rome&#x27;s claim to primacy based on Saint Peter and asserted that in reality its primacy came from the fact that Rome was the old imperial capital. He intervened in the riots in Constantinople against the arrest of the banker Kalomodios and secured his release, but during the coup of John Komnenos the Fat on 31 July 1200, he hid in a cupboard as the rebels seized control of the Hagia Sophia.

John X remained in office after Alexios III&#x27;s deposition in July 1203, and according to Western sources, both he and Alexios IV Angelos, threatened by the Fourth Crusade, acknowledged papal supremacy in the same year. After the capture of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204, he initially fled to Didymoteichon in Thrace. In 1206, Emperor of Nicaea Theodore I Laskaris invited him to Nicaea, where he had established the Empire of Nicaea, a Byzantine Greek successor state, but John X refused, perhaps because of his advanced age, and died in May of the same year.

The Crusaders then installed a Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople, while Theodore I Laskaris simply created a new provisional seat of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in Nicaea, which was eventually restored in Constantinople with the rest of the Empire in 1261.

== Presidents of Guatemala ==
Note: Regarding the numbering of the terms, several reliable sources state that Jimmy Morales is the 50th president

=== State of Guatemala (1839–1847) ===

=== Republic from Carrera to the Liberal Revolution (1847–1871) ===

=== Liberal period (1871–1944) ===

=== Ten-Year Revolution (1944–1954) ===
The authoritarian regime of Jorge Ubico, which persisted since 1931, was overthrown by a revolution known as the  &quot;Ten Years of Spring&quot; on 4 July 1944. After more than a month of mass student and trade union protests, Ubico resigned and fled to Mexico, transferring powers to his First Deputy, Federico Ponce Vaides. Presidential elections were held on 4 July 1944, which declared Ponce as the president. However, the opposition rejected the results, and as a result, on 20 October 1944, a group of young officers overthrew Ponce, creating a military-civilian government called the &quot;Revolutionary Government Junta&quot;. A new constitution was adopted and elections were held, which resulted in the victory of Juan José Arévalo in 1944 and Jacobo Árbenz in 1950. During this period, Guatemala underwent numerous social and economic reforms, including large-scale land reform.

=== Military governments (1954–1958) ===
Upon presenting his resignation, Jacobo Árbenz left Colonel Carlos Enrique Díaz, head of the Armed Forces, in charge of the presidency. Diaz&#x27;s first measure was the integration of a provisional government board which he led alongside Colonels Elfego H. Monzón and José Ángel Sánchez. On 29 June, Díaz was forced to resign, leading to Monzón succeeding as the new chairman of the board. Monzón would assemble a new governing board and incorporate Colonel Castillo Armas, Juan Mauricio Dubois, Jose Luis Cruz Salazar, and Enrique Oliva.

The new board would dissolve after a popular plebiscite held on 10 October 1954 would allow Colonel Castillo Armas to assume the presidency. Under Armas&#x27; mandate, several reforms implemented during the Guatemalan Revolution were suspended, and political opponents, as well as unions and peasant organizations, were persecuted. Armas&#x27; assassination on 26 July 1957, would prompt Congress to appoint Luis Arturo González as acting president and condition him to call for elections within four months.

The planned election was held on 20 October 1957, but the results were later nullified due to allegations of fraud. President González would resign and cede power to a provisional governing board led by Óscar Mendoza Azurdia, Gonzalo Yurrita Nova, and Roberto Lorenzana. The new board would govern for two days before Congress would appoint Colonel Guillermo Flores Avendaño as acting president. President Avendaño would call for elections in January 1958.

<text>Flores is the capital of the Petén Department, Guatemala&#x27;s landlocked, northernmost department. The population was 45,560 in 2023.

Flores is the seat of the municipality of Flores (population 22,600).

Its Catedral Nuestra Señora de Los Remedios y San Pablo Itzá is the cathedral episcopal seat of the Apostolic Vicariate of El Petén (formerly a territorial prelature).

The old part of the city is located on an island on Lake Petén Itzá, connected to the mainland by a short causeway. On the mainland is the suburb Santa Elena and, to the West, the contiguous municipality of San Benito. The municipality of Flores also includes a wide swathe of rural territory stretching north from Lake Petén Itzá to the Mexican border.

== History ==
In Pre-Columbian times, Flores was the Maya city of Nojpetén.

=== Nojpetén ===
Earliest archaeological traces on the island date back to 900–600 BC, with a major expansion of the settlement occurring around 250–400 AD, making it one of the
oldest continuously inhabited cities in the Americas.

The Itza left the Yucatán region in the 13th century and founded the city later known as Tayasal as their capital. They called it Nojpetén, (&quot;noj peten&quot;, literally &quot;Great Island&quot; in the Itza language). The Spanish called it Tayasal, possibly derived from &quot;ta Itza&quot;, or &quot;Place of the Itza&quot;.

It was here, on the island of Flores on the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, that the last independent Maya state held out against the Spanish conquerors. In 1541, Hernán Cortés came to the island, en route to Honduras, but needed to move on and did not try to conquer it.

The Spanish did not manage to conquer the island until 1697, when they marched in, attacked via boats, and destroyed it. Those who could flee did so, and many Itzá people hid in the jungle for years. From the ruins of Nojpetén arose the modern city of Flores. The modern city can thus be regarded as the second oldest continuously inhabited settlement in the Americas, after Cholula.

== Climate ==
Flores has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;) with year-round high temperatures. It has a lengthy wet season stretching from May to January, and a relatively brief dry season from February to April. As is typical with most monsoon climates, there is also some rainfall in the dry season, albeit significantly lighter. Daytime highs generally hover in the range for most of the year, falling slightly to between during the winter months. The hottest temperatures are observed just prior to the onset of the wet season, often rising above .

== Transportation ==
Flores is served by Mundo Maya International Airport. Several international flights land here but most stop first at Guatemala City&#x27;s La Aurora International Airport. The Island is also very well connected by bus, with many companies running overnight buses to Guatemala City.

== Gallery ==

=== Flores in the 19th century ===
The first photographs ever made from Flores were those taken by engineer Claudio Urrutia in 1897, when he was in charge of the Guatemala-Mexico Border Commission.

<doc id="272011" wikidata="Q7689757" url="?curid=272011" title="Tayasal (archaeological site)">
<text>Tayasal is a Maya archaeological site located in present-day Guatemala. It was a large Maya city with a long history of occupation. Tayasal is a corruption of &quot;Tah Itza&quot; (&quot;Place of the Itza&quot;), a term originally used to refer to the core of the Itza territory in Petén. The name Tayasal was applied in error to the archaeological site, and originally applied to the Itza capital. However, the name now refers to the peninsula supporting both the archaeological site and the village of San Miguel. The site was occupied from the Middle Preclassic period (c. 1000–350 BC) through to the Late Postclassic (c. 1200–1539 AD).

The site is a protected national monument.

==Location==
The Tayasal archaeological site is situated on a peninsula on Lake Petén Itzá a short distance to the north of the modern town of Flores, separated from it by a wide stretch of water, and falls within the municipality of Flores, in the department of Petén in northern Guatemala. The site covers an area of approximately . The southern portion of the peninsula also hosts the modern village of San Miguel, which probably covers a portion of the Postclassic occupation of the site. The peninsula fell within the core of the Postclassic Itza territory.

The protected area of the archaeological site is defined by the lakeshore to the north and west, and by the modern village of San Miguel to the south and east.

==Site history==

The Tayasal peninsula showed intense activity during the Late Preclassic (c. 400 BC - 250 AD). At this time, the city fully reflected ongoing developments in the Maya region, such as monumental architecture that included typical Preclassic Maya architectural forms such as the triadic pyramid and the E-Group ceremonial complex. Activity at the site continued right through to the Postclassic period. Investigations have identified that most Postclassic and colonial activity was concentrated on the southern shore of the peninsula. Very little is known about the use of the peninsula during the time of first contact with the Spanish, although early colonial accounts reported that the Itza frequently conducted rituals there. Evidence of Spanish contact includes a musketball excavated at the site. In 1702 and 1703, shortly after the Spanish conquest of Petén, Spanish missions were established on the Tayasal peninsula at San Miguel and San Bernabé, although the population of San Bernabé dropped off sharply through the course of the 18th century due to high infant mortality.

===Modern history===
The Tayasal archaeological site was declared a national monument in 1931. The University of Pennsylvania mapped the site in 1971, and its limits were defined by the Instituto de Antropología e Historia (Institute of Anthropology and History) in 1994. Tayasal has been excavated sporadically since the 1920s, beginning with Guthe&#x27;s excavations in 1921–1922, continuing with Morley&#x27;s dig in 1937 to 1938, by several others in the 1950s and 60s. The University of Pennsylvania undertook excavations in 1971, and again in 1977. The Proyecto Maya Colonial undertook a month-long investigation of the site in 1996. The Proyecto Arqueológico Tayasal was launched in 2009, with particular emphasis on the period of contact with the Spanish, and the early colonial years. The project also remapped the site with the objective of correcting any errors from the 1971 mapping project.

==Site description==

The University of Pennsylvania project mapped 339 structures; the city possessed large open plazas, palaces, pyramid-temples, an acropolis, defensive walls, residential buildings, and a cenote. As many as fifty burials and twelve caches have been recovered from Tayasal. The site core includes a number of large structures dating to the Classic period.

Mirador del rey Can&#x27;Ek &quot;King Kan Ek&#x27;s Lookout&quot; (Structures T65-T67) was a triadic pyramid, consisting of a massive pyramidal platform with a single access stairway, supporting two lesser structures flanking a principal structure. This architectural form dates it to the Late Preclassic. It was built on the higher portion of the peninsula.

Cerro Moo (Structures T256-T258) was another triadic pyramid, dating to the Late Preclassic, also built on the higher ground of the peninsula.

Group 23 is located to the southwest of the acropolis. It appears to have been built in the Late Preclassic as an E-Group. The E-Group axis is oriented 9° to the south of the east–west line, leading investigators to conclude that it was never used as an astronomical observatory as at other sites, but rather served a purely ceremonial function. It consists of a radial structure to the west and a long basal platform to the east that supported three buildings. At Tayasal, the radial structure appears to have been covered by later construction, including a group of structures dating to the Late Postclassic.

===San Bernabé===
The San Bernabé portion of the site occupies the northwestern area of the Tayasal peninsula. Various structures in this area have been dated to the Late Preclassic. After the Spanish conquest, San Bernabé was one of two Spanish missions established on the peninsula.

Structure T29 was a platform measuring and has a height of . It was built in the Late Preclassic and was reused in the Postclassic. It continued in use into the colonial period, and excavators recovered a number of colonial artefacts around the structure, including a silver Spanish coin, probably a &quot;real&quot;, Maiolica pottery, a lead bullet. It is likely that the platform supported a colonial-period residence.

Structure T30 was a circular structure in the northwestern portion of the site. It was elongated, measuring east-west by north-south, and stood high. It dates to the Preclassic, and served as the basal platform for four structures (denominated T-30a to T30d).

Structure T30a is a circular platform measuring across, and standing high. Its wall consists of three courses of soft limestone blocks, and its fill consists of a mix of soil and small stones. Recovered potsherds are dated to the Late Preclassic Chicanel Phase. A number of ritual deposits were excavated that date to the Late to Terminal Classic period, indicating continued use of the platform long after its construction. Although the majority of the building&#x27;s fill was Late Preclassic, the fill on the east side was dated to the Terminal Classic.

==Iconography==
Tayasal iconography is typical of Maya artefacts found in the surrounding Petén region that date approximately to the same time period. Examples of the imagery can be found on three excavated vases. The vases accompanied an individual who was interred at Tayasal during the Terminal Classic period; circa 8th century AD. The vases&#x27; images are thought to represent the elite status concerns, similar to those as depicted on carved stelae at neighbouring sites.

<doc id="272016" wikidata="Q719530" url="?curid=272016" title="Clapham Junction railway station">
<text>Clapham Junction () is a major railway station near St John&#x27;s Hill in south-west Battersea in the London Borough of Wandsworth, England, from and from . Despite its name, Clapham Junction is not in Clapham, a district to the south-east.

A major transport hub, Clapham Junction station is on both the South West Main Line and Brighton Main Line, as well as numerous other routes and branch lines which pass through or diverge from the main lines at this station. It serves as a southern terminus of both the Mildmay and Windrush lines of the London Overground.

Routes from London&#x27;s south and south-west termini, Victoria and Waterloo, funnel through the station, making it the busiest in Europe by number of trains using it: between 100 and 180 per hour, except for the five hours after midnight. The station is also the busiest UK station for interchanges between services, as well as the only railway station in Great Britain with more interchanges than entries or exits.

==History==


On 21 May 1838, the London and Southampton Railway became the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR), and opened its line from as far as . The second line, initially from Nine Elms to Richmond, opened on 27 July 1846. Nine Elms was replaced in 1848 as the terminus by Waterloo Bridge station, now Waterloo. The line to Victoria opened by 1860.

Clapham Junction opened on 2 March 1863, a joint venture of the L&amp;SWR, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) and the West London Extension Railway (WLER) as an interchange station for their lines.

The railway companies, to attract a middle- and upper-class clientele, seized the nonindustrial parish calculating that being upon the slopes of Clapham&#x27;s plateau would only reinforce this distinction, leading to a long-lasting misunderstanding that the station is in Clapham.

===Discontinued proposals===
A planning application from Metro Shopping Fund was withdrawn before governmental planning committee consideration on 20 May 2009.

A &#x27;Heathrow Airtrack&#x27; to reduce the 95-minute journey by tube and Gatwick Express to and unite the Great Western Main Line with Heathrow, Gatwick and the South West Main Line was cancelled in 2011 following improvements to the 2005-built Heathrow Connect track from and practical impediments, such as pressure for continued high-frequency services on the three deemed-&#x27;entrenched&#x27; semi-fast and slow services between Clapham Junction and Staines. Overground, the change would have been at Clapham Junction.

===Incidents and accidents===

====Clapham rail disaster====

On the morning of 12 December 1988, two collisions involving three commuter trains occurred slightly south-west of the station due to a defective signal. 35 people died and 484 were injured.

====Track bombing====
On the morning of 16 December 1991, a bomb ripped through tracks on one of the station&#x27;s platforms, causing major disruption to the rail network. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) claimed responsibility.

==The Junction==
The station is named Clapham Junction because it is at the junction of several rail lines. The name is not given to any rail junction near the station which, without end-on intercompany junctions, are:

* Falcon Junction at the south end of the station, where the West London Line (WLL) joins the Brighton Slow Lines
* Ludgate Junction at the eastern end of the Windsor Line platforms to the WLL
* Latchmere SW Junction connecting the WLL to the Windsor lines at Ludgate Junction.
* Latchmere Main Junction connecting the WLL to the Brighton Line at Falcon Junction.
* West London Extension Junction and Junction for Waterloo, relaid for Eurostar empty-stock moves from the Windsor Lines to the WLL.
* Pouparts Junction where the low-level and high-level approaches to Victoria split.

==The station today==
Each day more than 2,000 trains, over half of them stopping, pass through the station, more than through any other station in Europe. At peak times up to 200 trains per hour pass through of which 122 stop. It is not the busiest station by number of passengers, most of whom (about 430,000 on a weekday, of which 135,000 are at rush hours) pass through. Interchanges make some 40% of the activity and on that basis too it is the busiest station in the UK.

In 2011, the station had three entrances, all with staffed ticket offices:
* Only the south-east entrance is open 24 hours a day; it is the most heavily used of the three, leading from St John&#x27;s Hill via a small indoor shopping centre into a subway, some wide, that connects to the eastern ends of all platforms.
* The north entrance, which has restricted opening hours, leads from the Winstanley Estate on Grant Road to the same subway. The subway is crowded during rush hours, with the ticket barriers at the ends being pinch points.
* The south-west entrance, also known as the Brighton Yard entrance, as the buildings still bear signage for the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, has a more traditional appearance, with a Victorian station building set at the back of a large forecourt. This entrance leads to a very wide covered footbridge, which joins the western ends of all platforms. This entrance includes cycle parking and a taxi rank. It was re-opened in May 2011 as part of a wider programme of access improvements that included installing lifts to the platforms.

There are public and disabled toilets at the south-west entrance. There are refreshment kiosks in the subway, on the footbridge and on some platforms; and a small shopping centre, including a small branch of Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket, in the south-east entrance.

British Transport Police maintain a neighbourhood policing presence, whereas the Metropolitan Police Service and the part-Transport for London funded Safer Transport Command provides a police presence in the area outside the station.

On 9 December 2012, a new platform for the East London line opened, creating an orbital railway around inner London.

Overcrowding is most frequent in the often convenient but narrow cross-platform subway. Using this rather than the wide, elegant flying concourse for interchange, a visitors&#x27; eyes assessment of fabric and environment listed Clapham Junction in the most needy 10% of Department for Transport category B stations.

In an attempt to reduce overcrowding, a staircase to platforms 13 and 14 was replaced with a new wider staircase in April 2023.

===Platforms===

The station has seventeen platforms, numbered 1 to 17. In general, platforms 1 and 2 are used by London Overground trains, platforms 3–11 by South Western Railway trains and platforms 12–17 by Southern trains. Non-stop Gatwick Express trains pass through platforms 12 and 13.
* Platforms 1 and 2 are north-east facing bay platforms connected to the Mildmay and Windrush lines of the London Overground, handling services to and from via Willesden Junction and via Peckham. Usually, platform 1 is served by trains on the Mildmay line, while platform 2 is used by services on the Windrush line, although this usage can be reversed.
* Platforms 3 and 4 are through platforms on the Waterloo–Reading line towards .
* Platforms 5 and 6 are through platforms on the Waterloo–Reading line towards .
* Platform 7 is a through platform located at a siding off the South West Main Line fast line towards London Waterloo, used by stopping trains.
* Platform 8 is a through platform on the South West Main Line fast line towards London Waterloo, used by non-stop trains passing through this station.
* Platform 9 is a through platform on the South West Main Line fast line towards .
* Platform 10 is a through platform on the South West Main Line slow line towards London Waterloo.
* Platform 11 is a through platform on the South West Main Line slow line towards Woking.
* Platform 12 is a through platform on the Brighton Main Line fast line towards .
* Platform 13 is a through platform on the Brighton Main Line fast line towards .
* Platform 14 is a through platform on the Brighton Main Line slow line towards London Victoria.
* Platform 15 is a through platform on the Brighton Main Line slow line towards East Croydon.
* Platforms 16 and 17 are platforms connecting the Brighton Main Line slow line and the West London line, used by Southern services. Platform 16 is the northbound platform (towards ) and platform 17 is the southbound platform (towards East Croydon). Platform 17 can also be used by some terminating London Overground services as well.
Sidings leading into railway sheds at the west of the station are located between platforms 6 and 7.

Platform 8 must not be used for stopping trains, unless in an emergency, because the platform gap is too wide.

==Services==
All South Western Railway services from Waterloo pass through the station, as do Southern and Gatwick Express trains from Victoria. The Mildmay and Windrush lines of the London Overground have Clapham Junction as one of their termini.

The typical off-peak service of 104 trains an hour (tph) is:

* 4 tph to via Highbury &amp; Islington (Mildmay line)

During peak hours on weekdays express services on the South West Main Line and outer suburban services to Alton and Basingstoke typically do not stop at the station.

==Future proposals==
In the 2010s, a Clapham Junction station was proposed as part of the Crossrail 2 project. A large underground station dug underneath the existing station was proposed to serve Crossrail 2 service. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project was indefinitely postponed in 2020, although the route has been safeguarded.

The Northern line extension to Battersea Power Station was criticised for not extending to Clapham Junction. During the public inquiry into the extension in 2014, it was noted that although an extension to Clapham would be desirable, it was unnecessary to meet the needs of the Vauxhall Nine Elms Battersea regeneration area. Additionally, it was noted that a further extension could overwhelm the extension, due to the high demand. However, provision has been made for a future extension of the line to the station, with a reserved course underneath Battersea Park.

Government and Network Rail funding for in the early 2010s of £50 million of improvements was granted. This was an upgrade to the main interchange: new entrances and more retail.

In a Network Rail study in 2015, it was proposed that platform 0 could reopen for 8-car operations of the West London Line.

<doc id="272020" wikidata="Q4979897" url="?curid=272020" title="Bruun's FFT algorithm">
<text>Bruun&#x27;s algorithm is a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm based on an unusual recursive polynomial-factorization approach, proposed for powers of two by G. Bruun in 1978 and generalized to arbitrary even composite sizes by H. Murakami in 1996. Because its operations involve only real coefficients until the last computation stage, it was initially proposed as a way to efficiently compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of real data. Bruun&#x27;s algorithm has not seen widespread use, however, as approaches based on the ordinary Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm have been successfully adapted to real data with at least as much efficiency. Furthermore, there is evidence that Bruun&#x27;s algorithm may be intrinsically less accurate than Cooley–Tukey in the face of finite numerical precision .

Nevertheless, Bruun&#x27;s algorithm illustrates an alternative algorithmic framework that can express both itself and the Cooley–Tukey algorithm, and thus provides an interesting perspective on FFTs that permits mixtures of the two algorithms and other generalizations.

== A polynomial approach to the DFT ==

Recall that the DFT is defined by the formula:
formula_1

For convenience, let us denote the &quot;N&quot; roots of unity by ω&quot;N&quot;&quot;n&quot; (&quot;n&quot; = 0, ..., &quot;N&quot; − 1):
formula_2
and define the polynomial &quot;x&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) whose coefficients are &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;:
formula_3

The DFT can then be understood as a &quot;reduction&quot; of this polynomial; that is, &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot; is given by:
formula_4
where mod denotes the polynomial remainder operation. The key to fast algorithms like Bruun&#x27;s or Cooley–Tukey comes from the fact that one can perform this set of &quot;N&quot; remainder operations in recursive stages.

== Recursive factorizations and FFTs ==

In order to compute the DFT, we need to evaluate the remainder of formula_5 modulo &quot;N&quot; degree-1 polynomials as described above. Evaluating these remainders one by one is equivalent to the evaluating the usual DFT formula directly, and requires O(&quot;N&quot;2) operations. However, one can &quot;combine&quot; these remainders recursively to reduce the cost, using the following trick: if we want to evaluate formula_5 modulo two polynomials formula_7 and formula_8, we can first take the remainder modulo their product formula_7 formula_8, which reduces the degree of the polynomial formula_5 and makes subsequent modulo operations less computationally expensive.

The product of all of the monomials formula_12 for &quot;k&quot;=0..&quot;N&quot;-1 is simply formula_13 (whose roots are clearly the &quot;N&quot; roots of unity). One then wishes to find a recursive factorization of formula_13 into polynomials of few terms and smaller and smaller degree. To compute the DFT, one takes formula_5 modulo each level of this factorization in turn, recursively, until one arrives at the monomials and the final result. If each level of the factorization splits every polynomial into an O(1) (constant-bounded) number of smaller polynomials, each with an O(1) number of nonzero coefficients, then the modulo operations for that level take O(&quot;N&quot;) time; since there will be a logarithmic number of levels, the overall complexity is O (&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;).

More explicitly, suppose for example that formula_16, and that formula_17, and so on. The corresponding FFT algorithm would consist of first computing &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) mod
&quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;z&quot;), then computing &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;,&quot;j&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) mod
&quot;F&quot;&quot;k&quot;,&quot;j&quot;(&quot;z&quot;), and so on, recursively creating more and more remainder polynomials of smaller and smaller degree until one arrives at the final degree-0 results.

Moreover, as long as the polynomial factors at each stage are relatively prime (which for polynomials means that they have no common roots), one can construct a dual algorithm by reversing the process with the Chinese remainder theorem.

===Cooley–Tukey as polynomial factorization===

The standard decimation-in-frequency (DIF) radix-&quot;r&quot; Cooley–Tukey algorithm corresponds closely to a recursive factorization. For example, radix-2 DIF Cooley–Tukey factors formula_13 into formula_19 and formula_20. These modulo operations reduce the degree of formula_5 by 2, which corresponds to dividing the problem size by 2. Instead of recursively factorizing formula_22 directly, though, Cooley–Tukey instead first computes &quot;x&quot;2(&quot;z&quot; ω&quot;N&quot;), shifting all the roots (by a &quot;twiddle factor&quot;) so that it can apply the recursive factorization of formula_23 to both subproblems. That is, Cooley–Tukey ensures that all subproblems are also DFTs, whereas this is not generally true for an arbitrary recursive factorization (such as Bruun&#x27;s, below).

== The Bruun factorization ==

The basic Bruun algorithm for powers of two &quot;N&quot;=&quot;2&quot;&quot;n&quot; factorizes &quot;z&quot;&quot;2&quot;&quot;n&quot;-&quot;1&quot; recursively via the rules:

formula_24
formula_25

where &quot;a&quot; is a real constant with |&quot;a&quot;| ≤ 2. If formula_26, formula_27, then formula_28 and formula_29.

At stage &quot;s&quot;, &quot;s&quot;=0,1,2,&quot;n&quot;-1, the intermediate state consists of &quot;2&quot;&quot;s&quot; polynomials formula_30 of degree &quot;2&quot;&quot;n&quot;-&quot;s&quot; - &quot;1&quot; or less , where
formula_31

By the construction of the factorization of &quot;z&quot;&quot;2&quot;&quot;n&quot;-&quot;1&quot;, the polynomials &quot;p&quot;&quot;s&quot;,&quot;m&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) each encode 2&quot;n&quot;-&quot;s&quot; values
formula_32
of the Fourier transform, for &quot;m&quot;=0, the covered indices are &quot;k&quot;=&quot;0&quot;, 2&quot;k&quot;, 2∙2&quot;s&quot;, 3∙2&quot;s&quot;,…, (2&quot;n&quot;-&quot;s&quot;-1)∙2&quot;s&quot;, for &quot;m&quot;&gt;&quot;0&quot; the covered indices are &quot;k&quot;=&quot;m&quot;, 2&quot;s&quot;+1-&quot;m&quot;, 2&quot;s&quot;+1+&quot;m&quot;, 2∙2&quot;s&quot;+1-&quot;m&quot;, 2∙2&quot;s&quot;+1+&quot;m&quot;, …, 2&quot;n&quot;-&quot;m&quot;.

During the transition to the next stage, the polynomial formula_33 is reduced to the polynomials formula_34 and formula_35 via polynomial division. If one wants to keep the polynomials in increasing index order, this pattern requires an implementation with two arrays. An implementation in place produces a predictable, but highly unordered sequence of indices, for example for &quot;N&quot;=16 the final order of the 8 linear remainders is (0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 5).

At the end of the recursion, for , there remain linear polynomials encoding two Fourier coefficients and for the first and for the any other th polynomial the coefficients and .

At each recursive stage, all of the polynomials of the common degree are reduced to two parts of half the degree . The divisor of this polynomial remainder computation is a quadratic polynomial &quot;z&quot;&quot;m&quot;, so that all reductions can be reduced to polynomial divisions of cubic by quadratic polynomials. There are of these small divisions at each stage, leading to an algorithm for the FFT.

Moreover, since all of these polynomials have purely real coefficients (until the very last stage), they automatically exploit the special case where the inputs &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; are purely real to save roughly a factor of two in computation and storage. One can also take straightforward advantage of the case of real-symmetric data for computing the discrete cosine transform .

=== Generalization to arbitrary radices ===

The Bruun factorization, and thus the Bruun FFT algorithm, was generalized to handle arbitrary &quot;even&quot; composite lengths, i.e. dividing the polynomial degree by an arbitrary &quot;radix&quot; (factor), as follows. First, we define a set of polynomials for positive integers and for in by:
formula_36

Note that all of the polynomials that appear in the Bruun factorization above can be written in this form. The zeroes of these polynomials are formula_37 for formula_38 in the formula_39 case, and formula_40 for formula_41 in the formula_42 case. Hence these polynomials can be recursively factorized for a factor (radix) via:

formula_43

<text>The S-IVB (pronounced &quot;S-four-B&quot;) was the third stage on the Saturn V and second stage on the Saturn IB launch vehicles. Built by the Douglas Aircraft Company, it had one J-2 rocket engine. For lunar missions it was fired twice: first for Earth orbit insertion after second stage cutoff, and then for translunar injection (TLI).

==History==
The S-IVB evolved from the upper stage of the Saturn I rocket (the S-IV) and was the first stage of the Saturn V to be designed. The S-IV used a cluster of six RL-10 engines but used the same fuels as the S-IVB – liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. It was also originally meant to be the fourth stage of a planned rocket called the C-4, hence the name S-IV.

Eleven companies submitted proposals for being the lead contractor on the stage by the deadline of 29 February 1960. NASA administrator T. Keith Glennan decided on 19 April that Douglas Aircraft Company would be awarded the contract. Convair had come in a close second but Glennan did not want to monopolize the liquid hydrogen-fueled rocket market as Convair was already building the Centaur stage of the Atlas-Centaur rocket.

In the end, the Marshall Space Flight Center decided to use the C-5 rocket (later called the Saturn V), which had three stages and would be topped with an uprated S-IV called the S-IVB featuring a single J-2 engine, as opposed to the cluster of 6 RL-10 engines on the S-IV. Douglas was awarded the contract for the S-IVB because of the similarities between it and the S-IV. At the same time, it was decided to create the C-IB rocket (Saturn IB) that would also use the S-IVB as its second stage and could be used for testing the Apollo spacecraft in low Earth orbit.

12 200-series and 16 500-series S-IVB stages were built, alongside 3 test stages. NASA was working on acquiring 4 additional 200-series stages (as part of 4 new Saturn IB rockets, SA-213 to 216), but funding never materialized and the order was canceled in August 1968 before S-IVB hardware was assembled. Similarly, an order for two additional 500-series stages (for Saturn V rockets 516 and 517) was canceled around the same time.

==Configuration==

Douglas built two distinct versions of the S-IVB, the 200 series and the 500 series. The 200 series was used by the Saturn IB and differed from the 500 in that it did not have a flared interstage and it had less helium pressurization on board since it did not have to be restarted. In the 500 series, the interstage flared out to match the larger diameter of the S-II stage of the Saturn V. The 200 series also had three solid rockets for separating the S-IVB from the S-IB during staging. On the 500 series this was reduced to two, and two small Auxiliary Propulsion System (APS) thruster modules were added as ullage motors for restarting the J-2 engine and to provide attitude control during coast phases of flight.

The S-IVB carried of liquid oxygen (LOX), massing . It carried of liquid hydrogen (LH2), massing . Empty mass was 

===Auxiliary Propulsion System ===
Attitude control was provided by J-2 engine gimbaling during powered flight and by the two APS modules during coast. APS modules were used for three-axis control during coast phases, roll control during J-2 firings, and ullage for the second ignition of the J-2 engine. Each APS module contained two thrusters providing thrust for roll and pitch, another 150-pound-force thruster for yaw, and one thruster for ullage. Each module contained its own propellant tanks of dinitrogen tetroxide and monomethyl hydrazine as well as compressed helium to pressurize its propellants.

==Uses==
A surplus S-IVB tank, serial number 212, was converted into the hull for
Skylab, the first American space station. Skylab was launched on a Saturn V on May 14, 1973, and it eventually reentered the atmosphere on July 11, 1979. A second S-IVB, serial number 515, was also converted into a backup Skylab, but this one never flew.

From Apollo 13 onward, the S-IVB stages were crashed into the Moon to perform seismic measurements used for characterizing the lunar interior.

(* See List of artificial objects on the Moon for location.)

==Derivatives==

The second stage of the Ares I rocket and the proposed Earth Departure Stage (EDS) would have had some of the characteristics of the S-IVB stage, as both would have had an uprated J-2 engine, called the J-2X, with the latter performing the same functions as that of the Series 500 version of the stage (placing the payload into orbit, and later firing the spacecraft into trans-lunar space).

The MS-IVB was a proposed modification of the S-IVB that would have been used on a Mars flyby, but it was never produced.

<text>José María Reyna Barrios (December 24, 1854 – February 8, 1898) was President of Guatemala from March 15, 1892 until his assassination on February 8, 1898.

He was a moderate of Guatemala&#x27;s Liberal Party, who worked to solidify the less controversial of the reforms of late president Justo Rufino Barrios.

== Early life ==
José María Reyna Barrios was born in San Marcos, Guatemala and was nicknamed &quot;Reynita&quot;, the diminutive form, because of his short stature. He is the son of Celia Barrios de Reyna and Joaquín Reyna. He has three siblings, Manuel, María and María Antonia.

== Political life ==

Reyna Barrios was nephew of Justo Rufino Barrios, and as such he started his political career while his uncle was still President of Guatemala. After Barrios sudden death in Chalchuapa, El Salvador on April 2. 1885, Reyna Barrios increased his political activity under the government of Manuel Lisandro Barillas, who was jealous of his popularity and sent him to Europe under false pretenses that there was a diplomatic appointment for him. The appointment never materialized and Reina Barrios was stuck in Europe and then in the United States for a few years.

=== 1892 Presidential elections ===

Reyna Barrios finally made it back to Guatemala, in time to run for office in the 1892 presidential elections. It was the first election in Guatemala that allowed the candidates to advertise in the local newspapers. The candidates who ran for office were:

Barillas Bercian was unique among all liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his successor peacefully. When election time approached, he sent for the three Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be. The following anecdote recounts better what happened then:

First arrived lawyer Francisco Lainfiesta, and General Barillas, with the friendliest of smiles, said: &quot;Mr. Lainfiesta: you are one of the candidates in the upcoming elections and perhaps the more likely to win. Therefore, I would like to know what your attitude and your political system of government will be, if you get to win. Especially, I would like to know your attitude about my person; because I have made my mistakes, I do not deny it. I was a simple worker at my carpentry when General Justo Rufino Barrios sent for me to be appointed second presidential designate. I would therefore, Mr. Lainfiesta, know what conduct you will observe towards me.&quot; Mr. Lainfiesta said: &quot;&quot;General Barillas: if luck would favor me with the election victory, my government will be based on strict adherence to the Constitution; the law would be the law and anyone who has acquired some responsibility, will have to answer for it before the relevant courts. A firm and righteous compliance with the constitutional provisions shall be the standard of my conduct as president&quot;. &quot;Very well&quot; said general Barillas, and both parted cordially.

Barillas then brought in Dr. Montúfar and interrogated him in the same or similar way as he had done Mr. Lainfiesta. Dr. Montúfar responded in similar terms as Lainfiesta, stressing his claims to obedience of the Constitution and strict enforcement.

Finally general Reyna Barrios came in; when in the midst of pleasant conversation, General Barillas repeated his question, and Reyna replied, with a sincere smile: &quot;We should not even talk about that, general; because you and I are the same. Rest assured that I will know how to respect and protect you.&quot;&quot; And then both shook hands with effusion. By the election period, the first two days of voting favored Lainfiesta. But by the third day, a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán Indigenous people came down from the mountains to vote for general Reyna Barrios. The official agents did their job: Reyna was elected president and, not to offend the losing candidates, Barillas gave them checks to cover the costs of their presidential campaigns. Reyna Barrios, of course, received nothing, but he went on to become President on March 15, 1892.

== Government ==

During Barrrios&#x27;s first term in office, the power of the landowners over the rural peasantry increased. He oversaw the rebuilding of parts of Guatemala City on a grander scale, with wide, Parisian style avenues built. He oversaw Guatemala hosting the first &quot;Exposición Centroamericana&quot; (&quot;Central American Fair&quot;) in 1897. During his second term, Barrios printed bonds to fund his ambitious plans, fuelling monetary inflation and the rise of popular opposition to his regime.

=== Infrastructure ===

As part of the efforts for the Central American Expo, his government embellished the city with avenues and monuments following Parisian style and built the Northern Railroad of Guatemala. Due to the 1917-1918 earthquakes most of these structures were lost.

His administration also work on improving the roads, installing national and international telegraphs and introducing electricity to Guatemala City. Completing a transoceanic railway was a main objective of his government, with a goal to attract international investors at a time when the Panama Canal was not built yet.

== Death ==
In a very strange coincidence, Barrios was assassinated on February 8, 1898 at No. 8 on 8th Street in Guatemala City at 8:00 PM local time by Edgar Zollinger, a British citizen and administrator of the Aparicio Family business, who shot him with a .38 caliber revolver. After shooting the president, he was shot eight times by defenders. Zollinger took revenge since back on September 13, 1897 Reina Barrios had Juan Aparicio killed in an unlawful manner. Aparicio was the former Mayor of Quetzaltenango. His assets included the Zunil Electrical Plant, The Los Altos Railroad, Coffee Plantations and Local Bank. These businesses were appropriated illegally, leaving the Aparicio family in ruins for decades. The population mourned the death of Aparicio as he was loved for helping and aiding others. Reina Barrios lived his last moments as a criminal. His actions caused irreversible damage to Guatemalan infrastructure.

<text>Theophanes the Confessor (; 759 – 817 or 818) was a member of the Byzantine aristocracy who became a monk and chronicler. He served in the court of Emperor Leo IV the Khazar before taking up the religious life. Theophanes attended the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 and resisted the iconoclasm of Leo V the Armenian, for which he was imprisoned. He died shortly after his release.

Theophanes the Confessor, venerated on 12 March in both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church, should not be confused with Theophanes of Nicaea, whose feast is commemorated on 11 October.

==Biography==
Theophanes was born in Constantinople of wealthy and noble iconodule parents: Isaac, governor of the islands of the Aegean Sea, and Theodora, of whose family nothing is known. His father died when Theophanes was three years old, and the Byzantine Emperor Constantine V (740–775) subsequently saw to the boy&#x27;s education and upbringing at the imperial court. Theophanes would hold several offices under Leo IV the Khazar.

He was married at the age of eighteen, but convinced his wife to lead a life of virginity. In 779, after the death of his father-in-law, they separated with mutual consent to embrace the religious life. She chose a convent on an island near Constantinople, while he entered the Polychronius Monastery, located in the district of Sigiane (Sigriano), near Cyzicus on the Asian side of the Sea of Marmara. Later, he built a monastery on his own lands on the island of Calonymus (now Calomio), where he acquired a high degree of skill in transcribing manuscripts.

After six years he returned to Sigriano, where he founded an abbey known by the name &quot;of the big settlement&quot; and governed it as abbot. In this position of leadership, he was present at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, and signed its decrees in defense of the veneration of icons.

When Emperor Leo V the Armenian (813–820) resumed his iconoclastic warfare, he ordered Theophanes brought to Constantinople. The Emperor tried in vain to induce him to condemn the same veneration of icons that had been sanctioned by the council. Theophanes was cast into prison and for two years suffered cruel treatment. After his release, he was banished to Samothrace in 817, where overwhelmed with afflictions, he lived only seventeen days. He is credited with many miracles that occurred after his death, which most likely took place on 12 March, the day he is commemorated in the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot;.

==&quot;Chronicle&quot;==
At the urgent request of his friend George Syncellus, Theophanes undertook the continuation of Syncellus&#x27; &quot;Chronicle&quot; (, Chronographia), during the years 810 to 815. The language used occupies a place midway between the stiff ecclesiastical and the vernacular Greek. He made use of three main sources: first, material already prepared by Syncellus; second, he probably made the use of a set of extracts made by Theodore Lector from the works of Socrates Scholasticus, Sozomenus, and Theodoret; and third, the city chronicle of Constantinople. Cyril Mango has argued that Theophanes contributed but little to the chronicle that bears his name, and that the vast bulk of its contents are the work of Syncellus; on this model, Theophanes&#x27; main contribution was to cast Syncellus&#x27; rough materials together in a unified form.

Theophanes&#x27; part of the chronicle covered events from the accession of Diocletian in 284 (which is the point where the chronicle of George Syncellus ends) to the downfall of Michael I Rhangabes in 813. This part of the chronicle is valuable for having preserved the accounts of lost authorities on Byzantine history for the seventh and eighth centuries that would be otherwise have been lost.

The work consists of two parts, wherein the first provides a chronological history arranged per annum, and the second contains chronological tables that are regrettably full of inaccuracies. It seems that Theophanes had only prepared the tables, leaving vacant spaces for the proper dates, but that these had been filled out by someone else (Hugo von Hurter, &quot;Nomenclator literarius recentioris&quot; I, Innsbruck, 1903, 735). In the chronological first part, in addition to reckoning by the years of the world and the Christian era, Theophanes introduces in tabular form the regnal years of the Roman emperors, of the Persian kings and Arab caliphs, and of the five ecumenical patriarchs, a complex system which sometimes leads to considerable confusion.

The first part, though lacking in critical insight and chronological accuracy, greatly surpasses the majority of Byzantine chronicles. Theophanes&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; is particularly valuable beginning with the reign of Justin II (565), as in his work, he then drew upon sources that have not survived his times

Theophanes&#x27; &quot;Chronicle&quot; was much used by succeeding chroniclers, and in 873–875 a Latin compilation was made by the papal librarian Anastasius from the chronicles of Nicephorus, George Syncellus, and Theophanes for the use of a deacon named Johannes in the second half of the ninth century and thus was known to Western Europe.

There also survives a further continuation, in six books, of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; down to the year 961 written by a number of mostly anonymous writers (called Theophanes Continuatus or &quot;Scriptores post Theophanem&quot;), who undertook the work at the instructions of Constantine Porphyrogenitus.

Theophanes was the first to claim that the Prophet of the Islamic religion Muhammad had epilepsy.

<text>America West Express was the brand name for America West Airlines commuter and regional flights operated by Mesa Air Group&#x27;s Mesa Airlines under a code share agreement. Today Mesa Airlines operates for American Eagle.

Mesa Airlines operated America West Express from hubs at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona and Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada to regional destinations.

Chautauqua Airlines also operated America West Express regional jet service via a code sharing agreement in support of the America West hub in Columbus, Ohio.

America West Express&#x27; fleet consisted of 61 turboprop and regional jet aircraft.

==History==

America West Express started as a regional carrier in association with America West Airlines with a hub at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona. The name &quot;America West Express&quot; was taken from the old America West Airlines cargo service which had begun in 1985.
America West initially operated de Havilland Canada Dash 8 turboprop aircraft with its own flight crews; however, on November 30, 1992, America West signed a codeshare agreement with Mesa Airlines to operate America West Airlines&#x27; regional and commuter services as America West Express.
In the mid-1990s, with the opening of the America West Airlines hub at Port Columbus International Airport in Columbus, Ohio, America West Airlines used Mesa Airlines first with CRJ200s for 8 years with a crew base of pilots and flight attendants and then both Chautauqua Airlines to provide Embraer ERJ 145 regional jet service to feed the hub. When the Columbus hub was shut down, the Chautauqua Airlines code share was discontinued, leaving Mesa as the sole operator of AW Express services.

In 2003, America West greatly increased the size of its express operation by starting new routes operated by regional jets from its hub at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada.

In 2007, America West Express was branded as US Airways Express following the merger of America West with US Airways.

==Operators and fleet==
===Fleet===

===Historical regional jet fleet===

The America West Express brand, through its various regional and commuter airline partners, operated a variety twinjet aircraft over the years including the following types:

* Fokker 70

===Historical turboprop fleet===

The America West Express brand, through its various regional and commuter airline partners, operated a variety of twin turboprop aircraft over the years including the following types:

* Beechcraft 1900D
* Bombardier Q200
* Embraer EMB 120

==Services==
America West Express operated all of its fleet in a single coach class configuration. However, the CRJ-700s and CRJ-900s did offer dual class service at one point with separate first and coach class cabins. This dual class service was then subsequently dropped when it was determined that customers were not willing to pay extra for limited &quot;first class&quot; amenities on these short flights. Increasing the number of coach seats thus resulted in increased revenue.

== Identifying codes ==
Since these were code share flights, the America West Airlines codes were used for customer purposes. &quot;HPX&quot; indicates America West Express flights. However, the flights were actually operated under the Mesa Airlines codes.

<doc id="272035" wikidata="Q879169" url="?curid=272035" title="Manuel Estrada Cabrera">
<text>Manuel José Estrada Cabrera (21 November 1857 – 24 September 1924) was the President of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920. A lawyer with no military background, he modernised the country&#x27;s industry and transportation infrastructure, via granting concessions to the American-owned United Fruit Company, whose influence on the government was deeply unpopular among the population. Estrada Cabrera ruled as a dictator who used increasingly brutal methods to assert his authority, including armed strike-breaking, and he effectively controlled general elections. He retained power for 22 years through controlled elections in 1904, 1910, and 1916, and was eventually removed from office when the national assembly declared him mentally incompetent, and he was jailed for corruption. As such, he was the longest-serving leader of Guatemala.
Son of Pedro Estrada-Monzón and Joaquina Cabrera.

== Background ==

Estrada Cabrera was a lawyer. He studied at the Universidad Nacional and thanks to his work he reached the position of &quot;First Designated for the Presidency&quot; when José María Reina Barrios was elected to his second term as president. He was also the Secretary of Interior for most of Reina Barrios regime. When the Reina Barrios cabinet members were announced in 1892, a newspaper article that accompanied the images said: &quot;Manuel Estrada Cabrera, who is this gentleman?&quot; By 1920, when Estrada Cabrera was finally deposed, the writer got his answer.

== Interim President (1898) ==
After the assassination of Reina Barrios on February 8, 1898, the Guatemalan cabinet called an emergency meeting to appoint a new successor, but declined to invite Estrada Cabrera to the meeting, even though he was the First Designated to the Presidency. There are two versions on how he was able to get the Presidency: (a) Estrada Cabrera entered &quot;with pistol drawn&quot; to assert his entitlement to the presidency and (b) Estrada Cabrera showed up to the meeting and demanded to be given the presidency as he was the First Designated&quot;.

The first Guatemalan head of state from civilian life in over 50 years, Estrada Cabrera overcame resistance to his regime by August 1898 and called for September elections, which he won handily. At that time, Estrada Cabrera was 44 years old; he was stocky, of medium height, and broad-shouldered. The mustache gave him a plebeian appearance. Black and dark eyes, metallic sounding voice and was rather sullen and brooding. At the same time, he already showed his courage and character. This was demonstrated on the night of the death of Reina Barrios when he stood in front of the ministers meeting in the government palace to choose a successor, and said: &quot;Gentlemen, let me please sign this decree. As First Designated, you must hand me the Presidency&quot;. His first decree was a general amnesty and the second was to reopen all the elementary schools closed by Reyna Barrios, both administrative and political measures aimed at winning over public opinion. Estrada Cabrera was almost unknown in the political circles of the capital and one could not foresee the features of his government or his intentions.

=== Cabinet ===
* Interior and Justice: Francisco Anguiano
* Promotion: Antonio Barrios
* Finance: Rafael Salazar
* Public Instruction: Domingo Morales
* War: Salvador Toledo (replaced after a few months by Gregorio Contreras)
* Head of the Judiciary: José Pinto
* First appointed to the chair: Feliciano Aguilar
* Second appointed to the chair: Felipe Cruz 

=== Call for Elections ===

* &quot;(Estrada Cabrera) is a sincere man. He is also a committed man of good will and full of faith. Has strong ideas to fight for and for the sake of which would be sacrificed if necessary. He is a man.&quot;
* &quot;His lips form a contrast with his eyes. The eyes always bright, always calm, reveal the inner strength and mastery of his own soul. The lips are kind and sentimental. The forehead is broad and without crease, a studious man forehead which reflects intellectual robustness&quot;

And when the election was getting close:

* &quot;Two months ago, our candidate was a hope; today he is a reality. Two months ago we encouraged confidence in his principles, in his heart and in his talent. Today is his behavior that enhances and strengthens our confidence. So, after having a candidate for the Liberal Party, today we have a candidate for the Homeland. It was what we needed. Tomorrow, finally, every patriot will see to the best liberal patriotism and every nuance is that his liberalism.&quot;

In 1898 the legislature convened for the election of President Estrada Cabrera, who triumphed thanks to the large number of soldiers and policemen who went to vote in civilian clothes and to the large number of illiterate family members that they brought with them to the polls. Also, the effective propaganda that was written in the official newspaper &quot;the Liberal Idea &#x27;, run by the poet Joaquin Mendez. Among the writers were Enrique Gómez Carrillo, Rafael Spinola, Máximo Soto Hall and Juan Manuel Mendoza, and others.

Gómez Carrillo received as a reward for his work as political propagandist an appointment as general consul in Paris, with 250 gold pesos monthly salary, and immediately went back to Europe 

The other candidates were:

* José Luis Castillo de Leon, who had 5 &quot;castillistas&quot; clubs in the capital and in 70 municipalities, and who was the strongest candidate.
* Francisco Fuentes, who had most of his supporters in Quetzaltenango.
* Feliz Morales, former Minister of Reyna Barrios.

== First term: United Fruit Company ==

One of Estrada Cabrera&#x27;s most famous and most bitter legacies was the entry of the United Fruit Company into the Guatemalan economical and political arena. As a member of the Liberal Party, he sought to encourage development of the nation&#x27;s infrastructure of highways, railroads, and sea ports for the sake of expanding the export economy. When Estrada Cabrera assumed the presidency, there had been repeated efforts to construct a railroad from the major port of Puerto Barrios to the capital, Guatemala City. Yet, due to lack of funding exacerbated by the collapse of the internal coffee industry, the railway fell sixty miles short of its goal. Estrada Cabrera decided, without consulting the legislature or judiciary, that striking a deal with the United Fruit Company was the only way to finish the railway. Cabrera signed a contract with UFC&#x27;s Minor Cooper Keith in 1904 that gave the company tax-exemptions, land grants, and control of all railroads on the Atlantic side.

Estrada Cabrera often employed brutal methods to assert his authority, as was the fashion in Guatemala at the time. Like him, presidents Rafael Carrera y Turcios and Justo Rufino Barrios had led tyrannical governments in the country. Right at the beginning of his first presidential period, he started prosecuting his political rivals and soon established a well-organized web of spies.

One American Minister returned to the United States after he learned the dictator had given orders to poison him. Former President Manuel Barillas was stabbed to death in Mexico City, on a street outside of the Mexican presidential residence on Cabrera&#x27;s orders; the street now bears the name of Calle Guatemala. Also, Estrada Cabrera responded violently to workers&#x27; strikes against UFC. In one incident, when UFC went directly to Estrada Cabrera to resolve a strike (after the armed forces refused to respond), the president ordered an armed unit to enter the workers&#x27; compound. The forces &quot;arrived in the night, firing indiscriminately into the workers&#x27; sleeping quarters, wounding and killing an unspecified number.&quot;

In 1906 Estrada faced serious revolts against his rule; the rebels were supported by the governments of some of the other Central American nations, but Estrada succeeded in putting them down. Elections were held by the people against the will of Estrada Cabrera and thus he had the president-elect murdered in retaliation.

== Second term (1905–1911)==

Presidential elections were held on August 7, 1904, and Estrada Cabrera was again the winner. In December 1908 there was a measles epidemic all over the country, but it was efficiently controlled by the doctors of his regime.

* Infrastructure Secretary: Joaquín Méndez
* War Secretary: Luis Molina
* Secretary of Foreign Relations: Juan Barrios M.
* Secretary of the Interior: José María Reina Andrade
* Secretary of Education: Angel M. Bocanegra
* National Assembly:
** President: Arturo Ubico Urruela

** Robert Stockton Renolds Hitt (1 October 1910 – 1911)

=== &quot;The Bomb&quot; assassination attempt ===

In early 1907, lawyer Enrique Ávila Echeverría and his brother, physician Jorge Ávila Echeverría, along with Dr. Julio Valdés Blanco and electrical engineer Baltasar Rodil, planned a bombing attack on the president of Guatemala, Estrada Cabrera, which took place on April 29, 1907, and is generally known in Guatemala as &quot;The Bomb&quot;. The Echeverría brothers and their confederates were members of the elite class and had studied abroad, but when they returned to Guatemala, they objected to the government&#x27;s extreme abuse of power and determined on assassinating the president. They decided on explosives. They prepared everything meticulously: the explosives, the detonators, the day and the exact time; even the president&#x27;s driver—Patrocinio Monterroso—was part of the conspiracy.

On the day planned for the attack, April 29, the president was traveling in the capital in his chariot along with his 13-year-old son, Joaquin, and his Chief of Staff, general José María Orellana. Around 10 a.m., the president and his retinue were traveling on 7th S. Avenue, between the 16th and 17th W streets when the bomb detonated. The explosion failed to injure Estrada Cabrera or those that were with him. Only the driver and one of the horses died.

On May 2, 1907, Emilio Ubico, brother of Arturo Ubico Urruela—president of Congress—and uncle of Jorge Ubico Castañeda—political chief of Verapaz, was appointed Chief of Police, in charge of the investigations, along the Secretary of the Interior, Reina Andrade. A few days later, Congress issued Decree 737, by which any explosive-related import was prohibited, unless previously authorized by the Secretary of War.

Over the next twenty-two days, the four conspirators fled through the small streets and little holes that they could find, trying to escape from Guatemala City, but the government surrounded the city and slowly tightened the perimeter while combing every inch of terrain. The conspirators&#x27; families were incarcerated and prosecuted. Others conspirators, brothers Juan and Adolfo Viteri and Francisco Valladares, were arrested when they attempted to flee disguised as women in Guastatoya. Others, like Felipe and Rafael Prado Romaña, tried to flee to El Salvador, but were captured when someone informed on them. The Romaña brothers remained imprisoned until their death. Only the Colombian Rafael Madriñán escaped the country on a bicycle. The mother of the Romaña brothers took the Mexican Ambassador, Federico Camboa, to the house where the Avila Echeverría brothers and his friends were hiding, who, knowing that they had only days to live, gave him all their valuables and begged him to pass them on to their relatives.

At last, after several days of uncertainty, Rufina Roca de Monzón gave them shelter in the second floor of her home, # 29 Judío Place in Guatemala City, but a spy learned about it. On May 20, 1907, at 3 a.m. the house was surrounded by a platoon of soldiers. The troop broke down the door and tried to reach the second floor, but at that moment gunfight began. By 6 a.m. the conspirators were out of ammo and exhausted and decided to kill themselves before becoming prisoners of the regime. The &quot;Diario de Centro América&quot;, then a semi-official newspaper owned by Estrada Cabrera, went as far as to publish the conspirators autopsy details.

=== &quot;The cadets&quot; assassination attempt ===

By 1908, Santo Domingo Church members had modified the path of its centennial and traditional Good Friday procession, such that now it passed in front of Estrada Cabrera&#x27;s house on the 7th S. Avenue in Guatemala City. That year, several Military Academy cadets, after noticing that the procession uniforms completely covered the face of the penitents, decided to disguise themselves and blend in with the procession and by the time it passed in front of the president&#x27;s house, they would storm in and take him prisoner. However, the extremely efficient spy system that Estrada Cabrera had in place allowed him to thwart the kidnapping attempt. As soon as he learned about this, Estrada Cabrera prohibited the procession from passing in front of his house, placed a fence in front of it and prohibited the use of masks for the Holy Week processions.

On April 20, 1908, during the official reception of the new United States Ambassador in the National Palace, Military Academy cadet Víctor Manuel Vega, in revenge for what happened to his classmates and teachers, shot Estrada Cabrera point blank, but only managed to hurt him on his pinky finger. A flag from the official escort kept the bullet from reaching the president. Enraged, and in order to set a precedent, Estrada Cabrera ordered the shooting death of all Vega&#x27;s Military Academy unit, except two, Rogelio Girón and Manuel Hurtarte, who were taken prisoners without any legal document. Vega had died on the spot where he tried to attack the president, killed instantly by his bodyguards. The president also ordered the Military Academy to be closed, its building demolished and that salt would be spread on the field. Several military officers were sent to prison, including some loyal to the president.

Conditions in the Penitentiary were cruel and foul. Political offenses were tortured daily and their screams could be heard all over the Penitentiary. Prisoners regularly died under these conditions since political crimes had no pardon.

It has been suggested that the extreme despotic characteristics of the man did not emerge until after an attempt on his life in 1907.

=== Suicide of his children ===

In 1910 both his wife, Desideria Ocampo, and his firstborn child, Diego Estrada, died of tuberculosis. Desideria Ocampo died in Nice, France after Estrada Cabrera sent her there for treatment. Diego had contracted a venereal disease while he was studying in the United States. The treatment of this, and his previous excesses led to tuberculosis; unable to cope with it, he killed himself. On November 8, 1912, Francisco Estrada, who had just returned to Guatemala from Europe where he was learning agricultural technology in Paris, found himself in a 4000 dollar debt after courting a French lady older than himself. When Estrada Cabrera found out about this, he put the receipt under his son&#x27;s dinner plate and waited for his reaction. When Francisco came down for dinner, he saw the receipt and turned pale. Without saying a word, he left the dining room and shot himself in his room.

== Third presidential term ==

=== New military academy ===

Estrada Cabrera established a military academy in the Army Artillery Fort in 1915. The building, constructed in 1907, suffered severe damage during the 1917–1918 earthquakes, and was not open again until the end of 1919.

== Fourth presidential term ==

=== Social structure ===

In 1920, prince Wilhelm of Sweden visited Guatemala and made a very objective description of both Guatemalan society and Estrada Cabrera government in his book &quot;Between two continents, notes from a journey in Central America, 1920&quot;. The prince explained the dynamics of Guatemalan society at the time pointing out that even though it called itself a &quot;Republic&quot;, Guatemala had three sharply defined classes:

# Criollos: a minority comprised originally by ancient families descendants of the Spaniards that conquered Central America and that by 1920 comprised both political parties in the country. By 1920, they were mixed to a large extent with foreigners and the great majority were of Indian descent. They led the country both politically and intellectually partly because their education, although poor by European standards of the time, was enormously superior to the rest of the people of the country, partly because only criollos were allowed in the main political parties and also because their families controlled and for the most part owned the cultivated parts of the country.
# Ladinos: middle class. Formed of people born of the cross between natives, blacks and criollos. They held almost no political power in 1920 and comprised the bulk of artisans, storekeepers, tradesmen and minor officials. In the eastern part of the country they were usually agricultural laborers.
# Indians: the majority conformed by a mass of natives. Slow of wit, uneducated and disinclined to all forms of change, they had furnished excellent soldiers for the Army and often rose, as soldiers, to positions of considerable trust given their disinclination for independent political activity and their inherent respect for government and officialdom. They made the main element in the working agricultural population. There were three categories within them:
## &quot;Mozos colonos&quot;: settled on the plantations. Were given a small piece of land to cultivate on their own account, in return for work in the plantations for many months of the year.
## &quot;Mozos jornaleros&quot;: day-laborers who were contracted to work for certain periods of time. They were paid a daily wage. In theory, each &quot;mozo&quot; was free to dispose of his labor as he or she pleased, but they were bound to the property by economical ties. They could not leave until they had paid off their debt to the owner, and they were victim of those owners, who encouraged the &quot;mozos&quot; to get into debt beyond their power to free themselves by granting credit or lending cash. If the mozos ran away, the owner could have them pursued and imprisoned by the authorities, with all the cost incurred in the process charged to the ever increasing debt of the mozo. If one of them refused to work, he or she was put in prison on the spot. Finally, the wages were extremely low. The work was done by contract, but since every &quot;mozo&quot; starts with a large debt, the usual advance on engagement, they became servants to the owner.
## Independent tillers: living in the most remote provinces, survived by growing crops of maize, wheat or beans, sufficient to meet their own needs and leave a small margin for disposal in the market places of the towns and often carried their goods on their back for up to twenty five miles a day.

=== Country condition ===

Prince Wilhelm also described how the country was after two decades of government of Estrada Cabrera. Guatemala was naturally rich:
* On the Pacific coast one found sugar, coffee, spices and cocoa in great quantities; the plantations gave a splendid yield, and the productiveness of the soil in proportion to area was unique. 
* On the east coast, there were enormous banana plantations.
* And on the highlands, maize, wheat and corn were grown, and fine coffee grew as far up as 1600 m above sea level.
* Minerals such as gold, copper, tin and quicksilver were abundant but they were not exploited because the natives kept their whereabouts closely concealed.

But the means of communication were poorly developed; aside from the railway that ran from shore to shore going through Guatemala City and was run by the United Fruit Company, there were only paths and tracks, marked on the maps as highways, but in reality just narrow mule-roads.

Guatemala was placed in a tough spot, after the previous president known as Jose Maria Reyna Barrios (1854-1898) started to introduce a new type of paper currency. Due to the input of these new dollars known as the Guatemalan Quetzal, their value would slowly start to decrease in value, resulting in inflation within the economy. However, Jose Maria Barrios was assassinated before he was able to complete this transition between paper currencies. As a result, Manuel Estrada Cabrera inherited a country with a huge economic problem. Unfortunately, he was unable to succeed instantly, for to keep his government afloat, plus improve on the countries educational system. He had to temporarily increase again the production of the quetzal, thus increasing inflation. To solve this growing issue, Cabrera called for the assistance of the well-known economist, Edwin W. Kremmerer in 1919. Kremmerer was able to restructure Guatemala’s monetary system, plus give a few tips on how to better improve it, unfortunately, none of these were applied for Estrada was overthrown before they could be implemented. Fortunately, he succeeded in making education easily obtainable for some of the most rural parts of Guatemala. 

Besides being oppressed by brutal and dishonest officials and landowners, the natives were suffering of an endemic alcoholism problem. There were drinking places everything – as the government derived a certain revenue from the proceeds – with low quality spirits that had terrible effects. Both men and women got drunk regularly and changed their normally peaceful demeanor into an alcohol induced rage that results in mutilations and murder.

By the fourth term of Estrada Cabrera, despotism prevailed. Universal suffrage was the rule, but presidential elections were a farce as only the President himself was allowed to figure on the ballot papers and opposition was forbidden as any rival candidate was looked after by the police, and detained at best if not killed outright. Besides, anyone declining to vote was a suspect at once, and each plantation received a list of how many &quot;mozos&quot; are to vote in the elections.

The president&#x27;s ministers were simply his advisors and the state revenues had made its way to the presidential pocket: following the rule established by his predecessors managed to lay aside a fortune of 150 million, in spite of earning only US$1000 a year. The President chose the ministers from among his most faithful adherents, and they had no voice whatsoever in the final decision of affairs; and Congress was not much better, as no laws were ever passed without previous approval from the highest quarter. Finally, the courts of law were complete pledged to the presidential interests.

Throughout the entire administration prevailed rampant corruption. In the case of the president and ministers they procured additional revenues for themselves by granting concessions and the like; lower officials get money as they saw fit. All these issues were rarely known as everyone feared for their own life and keep silent.

=== Armed forces ===

There was a universal conscription law, but almost any one could obtain exemption by payment and in reality only &quot;mozos&quot; were recruited. If there was ever a need for additional recruits, they were gathered by force. The pay of the army went only as far as the generals; the rank and file went about in rags and beg; proper uniform and army boots was non-existent with the soldiers going around barefoot. There was one general for each 100 men and they were the only ones that had dilapidated half boots.

The soldiers, like the general population, were uneducated as it was in the interest of the authorities to keep them as ignorant as possible in order that the masses might be more easily led.

=== 1917–1918 earthquakes ===
The seismic activity started on 17 November 1917 and ruined several settlements around Amatitlán. On December 25 and 29 of the same year, and on January 3 and 24 of the next, there were stronger earthquakes felt on the rest of the country, which destroyed a number of buildings and homes in both Guatemala City and Antigua Guatemala.

The &quot;Diario de Centro América&quot;, a semi-official newspaper owned in part by President Estrada Cabrera, spent more than two months issuing two numbers a day reporting on the damage, but after a while, started criticizing the central government after the slow and inefficient recovery efforts. In one of its articles, it went as far as to tell that some holy Jesus sculptures from the City had been saved because they had been taken away from their churches after the first earthquake as they &quot;did not want to stay anymore in a city where excessive luxury, impunity and terror were rampant&quot;. Likewise, the newspaper complained that the National Assembly was issuing &quot;excellent&quot; laws, but nobody was &quot;going by the law&quot;. Finally, on its front page of May 1918, it complained that there was &quot;still debris all over the city&quot;. The &quot;Diario de Centro América&quot; itself was print in the rubble, in spite of which it was able to issue its two daily numbers.

&quot;El Guatemalteco&quot;, the official newspaper, showed the impact of the disaster: its regular publication was interrupted from 22 December 1917 to 21 January 1918; when it reappeared, it was in a much smaller format.



== Unionist Party and end of Cabrera&#x27;s regime ==


Opposition to his regime started after the 1917–1918 earthquakes as it was evident that the President was incapable of leading the recovery efforts. Bishop of Facelli, Piñol y Batres from the Aycinena family, began preaching against the government policies in the San Francisco Church in 1919, instructed by his cousin, Manuel Cobos Batres. For the first time, the Catholic Church opposed the President. Additionally, Cobos Batres was able to inflame the nationality sentiment of conservative leaders José Azmitia, Tácito Molina, Eduardo Camacho, Julio Bianchi and Emilio Escamilla into forming a Central America Unionist party and oppose the strong regime of Estrada Cabrera. The Unionist party began its activities with the support of several sectors of the Guatemala City society, among them the Universidad Estrada Cabrera students and the labor associations, who under the leadership of Silverio Ortiz founded the Patriotic Labor Committee.

The new party was called &quot;Unionist&quot;, to differentiate it from both the Liberal and Conservative parties and therefore be able to appeal all &quot;good willing, freedom and democracy loving&quot; men who &quot;dreamed of the Central America Union&quot;. The headquarters of the new party were in a house belonging to the Escamilla family which soon was known as &quot;People&#x27;s House&quot;. Tácito Molina wrote a founding Act for the party, which was signed by fifty one citizens on 25 December 1919 and was later known as the &quot;Three-fold Act&quot; because it had to be folded in three when it was distributed to the citizens of the city. The document was distributed in Guatemala City until January 1, 1920.

Estrada Cabrera was forced to accept the new party due to the internal and international pressure. On March 1, 1920, the National Assembly officially accepted the new party. Since then, Estrada Cabrera publicly admitted his willingness to accept the international opinion on opening spaces for political rivals, but kept arresting Unionist sympathizers. On 11 March 1920, the new party organized a large demonstration against the government, but the army fired into the crowd, fomenting more resentment and anger which further united the Guatemalan people against the President.

The National Assembly, whose president then was Adrián Vidaurre, former Secretary of War and one of the most important members of Cabrera&#x27;s cabinet, declared the President unable to continue and designated Carlos Herrera y Luna as interim president. Cabrera resisted this designation and settled for a fight from his residence in &quot;La Palma&quot;, until he was defeated in April, following the &quot;Tragic Week&quot; during which Guatemala was in a state of revolution against the regime, and armed Unionists fought Cabrera&#x27;s soldiers in the streets. 
 Estrada Cabrera finally surrendered on April 14, 1920, along with his loyal friend, Peruvian poet José Santos Chocano.

Estrada Cabrera’s downfall had quite a unique conclusion without the involvement of the United States. Overall, American interests where no longer considering Estrada Cabrera as a suitable patron, especially American companies such as The United Fruit Company. It was unusual at the time to see The United States turn their back on Estrada Cabrera, for U.S. representation would usually act as a “kingmaker,” as put in the words of James R Handysource?.

It was believed that one of the reasons that led to Estrada Cabrera not receiving any support from the U.S. was due to Guatemala&#x27;s lack of involvement during the First World War. The U.S. requested that the Estrada Government restrict the large German-Guatemalan population, which held several assets connected to coffee as explained by Ralph Lee Woodward. Cabrera did very little when it came down to seizing these German-owned businesses and reselling them to American companies. One of the German-owned businesses to have been seized was the Empresa Eléctrica del Sur, which was later sold to an American business called Henry W. Catlin’s Electric Lighting Company in 1885. 

=== His loyal adherents until the end ===

== Death ==
Estrada Cabrera was sent to prison for life after he was deposed. He died after a few years, in 1924, and was laid to rest in Quetzaltenango.

== Legacy ==

=== Minerva celebrations ===


Estrada&#x27;s most curious legacy was his attempt to foster a cult of Minerva in Guatemala: Early in his reign he indicated interest in education and in 1899 he initiated feasts of Minerva, celebrating accomplishments of students and teachers based on an idea of his Secretary of Infrastructure, Rafael Spinola. Estrada Cabrera ordered the construction of a Hellenic style &quot;Temples of Minerva&quot; in Guatemala City, and a few years later all major cities of the country had their own, sponsored by the local tax payers. In the temples, Estrada Cabrera celebrated the &quot;Fiestas Minervalias&quot; for studious youth.

He extended roads, and the long-delayed railway from the Atlantic coast to Guatemala City was completed in 1908, although his achievements were overshadowed by growing repression and blatant graft, including bribes for the president. The lot of native workers was little better than peonage, and everywhere there was surveillance to report subversive activities.

== In fiction ==
Estrada Cabrera was immortalized in the dictator novel &quot;El Señor Presidente&quot; (1946), written by Nobel laureate Miguel Ángel Asturias. Although the most famous, this is not the only book written about him: Rafael Arevalo Martinez wrote a book on his life, government and overthrow called &quot;Ecce Pericles&quot;, and Carlos Wyld Ospina wrote &quot;El Autócrata&quot;, a bitter biography of the president.

The role that UFCO played in Guatemala during the Estrada Cabrera and Jorge Ubico regimes is described in three novels from Miguel Ángel Asturias called &quot;The Banana Trilogy&quot;: &quot;Viento Fuerte&quot;, &quot;El Papa Verde&quot;, and &quot;Los Ojos de los Enterrados&quot;.

<doc id="272040" wikidata="Q165811" url="?curid=272040" title="Flag of Chad">
<text>The national flag of Chad is a vertical tricolour of indigo, yellow, and red. It was adopted on 6 November 1959, almost a year after the founding of the autonomous Republic of Chad. Since the 1990s, its similarity to the flag of Romania has caused international discussion.

== Colours ==

==Description==
The flag of Chad is a vertical tricolour consisting (left to right) of an indigo, a yellow, and a red column. The colours of the Chadian flag were intended to be a combination of the colours of blue, white and red as seen on the flag of France with the Pan-African colours of green, yellow and red as seen on the flag of Ethiopia. Furthermore, the indigo represents the expanse of Lake Chad, a vital water source and an emblem of life and hope for the nation; the yellow represents the vast, arid sands of the Sahara Desert, which dominate the northern landscape of the country, and the red represents the sacrifices made during Chad’s struggle for independence, serving as a poignant reminder of the bloodshed and courage that paved the way for the nation’s sovereignty. Each color in the design holds deep symbolic significance rooted in Chad’s geography, history, and identity.

The flag was adopted in 1959 for the autonomous republic and retained on independence in 1960, and in the constitution of 1962. Despite many political upheavals within Chad since independence, the flag has not been changed. This may be because the flag is not associated with any of the main power rivals within Chad, which had no sense of national identity before independence, and little after independence.

== Similarity with Romanian flag ==

The flag of Chad is almost identical to the national flag of Romania, although the colours in Chad flags may vary more than those specified for Romania. Romania has used the flag since 1866, which appeared for the first time in its current form in Wallachia. It was officially in use from 1866 until 1948, when it was superseded by the flag of the Socialist Republic of Romania. Chad began to use its present flag in 1960, after it achieved independence from France. When Chad adopted its flag, Romania&#x27;s flag also included an emblem in the middle of the flag on top of the tricolour; this was added after World War II during the Communist era of the second half of the 20th century. However, in 1989 Romania&#x27;s Communist government was overthrown and the insignia was removed, reverting Romania&#x27;s flag to the prewar version which matched the one which had been adopted by Chad in the meantime.

The issue of Romania and Chad sharing similar flags has concerned the Chadian government on occasion; they requested in 2004 the United Nations to examine the issue. In response, Romanian President Ion Iliescu stated that no change would occur to the flag, as the existence of Romania&#x27;s tricolour predates the existence of Chad as a whole: &quot;The tricolour belongs to us. We will not give up the tricolour.&quot;

<doc id="272043" wikidata="Q549431" url="?curid=272043" title="Jorge Ubico">
<text>Jorge Ubico Castañeda (10 November 1878 – 14 June 1946), nicknamed Number Five or also Central America&#x27;s [[Napoleon]], was a Guatemalan military officer, politician, and dictator who served as the president of Guatemala from 1931 to 1944.

A general in the Guatemalan military, he was elected to the presidency in 1931, in an election where he was the only candidate. He continued his predecessors&#x27; policies of giving massive concessions to the United Fruit Company and wealthy landowners, as well as supporting their harsh labor practices. Ubico has been described as &quot;one of the most oppressive tyrants Guatemala has ever known&quot; who compared himself to Adolf Hitler. He was removed by a pro-democracy uprising in 1944, which led to the ten-year Guatemalan Revolution.

==Early years==

Jorge Ubico was the son of Arturo Ubico Urruela, a lawyer and politician of the Guatemalan Liberal Party. Ubico Urruela was a member of the legislature that wrote the Guatemalan Constitution of 1879, and was subsequently the president of the Guatemalan Congress during the government of Manuel Estrada Cabrera (1898–1920). Jorge Ubico was privately tutored, and attended some of Guatemala&#x27;s most prestigious schools, as well as receiving further education in the United States and Europe.

By 1897 Ubico received his commission into the Guatemalan army as a second lieutenant, a commission which was largely due to his political connections. He rapidly established himself in the army and rose through the ranks, and, after a military campaign against El Salvador, held the rank of colonel at the age of 28. A year later, he was made the governor (&quot;jefe politico&quot;) of the province of Alta Verapaz, followed four years later as governor of Retalhuleu.

During his tenure, he oversaw improvements in public works, the school system, public health, and youth organizations. In 1918, he drained swamps, ordered fumigation and distributed free medicine to combat a yellow fever epidemic, and won the praise of Major General William C. Gorgas, who had done the same in Panama. However, most of his reputation came from his harsh but effective punishment of banditry and smuggling across the Mexican border.

He returned to Guatemala City in 1921 to participate in a coup that installed General José María Orellana into the presidency, after the sitting president Carlos Herrera refused to ratify the concessions that Estrada Cabrera had made to the United Fruit Company. Under Orellana he was appointed Secretary of War in 1922, but quit a year later. In 1926, after the death of President Orellana, Ubico ran unsuccessfully for president as the candidate of the Political Progressive Party. He temporarily retired to his farm until the next election.

==Guatemalan instability==

In December 1930, President Lázaro Chacón González was forced to resign after having a stroke. By that time, Guatemala was in the midst of the Great Depression and bankrupt; Chacón&#x27;s successor, Baudilio Palma, was deposed by a coup d&#x27;état after only four days in office and was replaced by Gral. Manuel María Orellana. The United States opposed the new government and demanded Orellana resign; he was forced to leave the presidency in favor of José María Reina Andrade.

==Election ==
The Liberal Party allied with the Progressives to nominate Ubico as Andrade&#x27;s successor, in an election where Ubico was the only candidate on the ballot. In February 1931 he was elected with 305,841 votes. In his inaugural address, he pledged a &quot;march toward civilization&quot;. Once in office, he began a campaign of efficiency which included assuming dictatorial powers.

== Government ==

=== Military dictatorship ===
Ubico&#x27;s rule has been characterized as totalitarian; John Gunther, who visited the country during 1941, described Guatemala as &quot;a country 100 per cent dominated by a single man.&quot; Added Gunther: &quot;He [Ubico] has spies and agents everywhere, and knows everyone&#x27;s private business to an amazing degree. Not a pin drops in Guatemala without his knowing it.&quot; Guatemala under Ubico was likened to &quot;a modern jail.&quot;

He militarized numerous political and social institutionsincluding the post office, schools, and symphony orchestrasand placed military officers in charge of many government posts. He frequently traveled around the country performing &quot;inspections&quot; in dress uniform followed by a military escort, a mobile radio station, an official biographer, and cabinet members.

=== UFCO and relations with the US ===
Ubico considered Guatemala to be the closest ally of the United States in Central America. Adopting a pro-USA stance to promote economic development and recovery from depression, Ubico permitted the United Fruit Company to become the most important company in Guatemala. It received import duty and real estate tax exemptions from the government and controlled more land than any other group or individual. It also controlled the sole railroad in the country, the sole facilities capable of producing electricity, and the port facilities at Puerto Barrios on the Atlantic coast. 

=== Relations with Germany ===

As part of a goodwill worldwide tour promoting the Berlin 1936 Summer Olympics, in January of that year the German light cruiser Emden arrived in Guatemala. Its crew travelled by train to Guatemala City, where they paraded in front of Ubico&#x27;s Army staff and the general public.

=== Middle class ===
While the middle class grew substantially during Ubico&#x27;s regime, the basic character of the regime remained oligarchical and his regime primarily benefited the landowning class. The country&#x27;s middle class, resentful of its exclusion from the government, later spearheaded the democratic revolution that removed Ubico from power.

=== Napoleon ===
Ubico considered himself to be &quot;another Napoleon&quot;. He admired Napoleon Bonaparte extravagantly and preferred to have his photograph taken in his general&#x27;s uniform. Although he was much taller and weighed more than his hero, Ubico believed that he resembled Bonaparte, and his nickname was &quot;the Little Napoleon of the Tropics&quot;. He dressed ostentatiously and surrounded himself with statues and paintings of Napoleon, regularly commenting on the similarities between their appearances.

=== Anti-corruption ===

Despite his dictatorship, Ubico was commended by both his defenders and his detractors for his personal integrity and for virtually eliminating corruption in Guatemala; anyone found guilty of corruption was &quot;instantly&quot; and &quot;severely&quot; punished. The so-called Probity Law mandated that all public officials publicly declare their assets before taking office and upon leaving it – and the law was rigorously enforced.

=== Repression and controversy ===
====Police chief embezzlement accusation====
On 18 September 1934, Efraín Aguilar Fuentes, Juventino Sánchez, Humberto Molina Santiago, Rafael Estrada Guilles, and Colonel Luis Ortiz Guzmán were tortured and executed inside the Guatemala National Penitenciary, accused of planning a plot to overthrow president Ubico.

In his book &quot;The paradox garden&quot; (Spanish: &quot;&quot;), written in 1935, Guatemalan writer Efraín De los Ríos accused the police chief, General Roderico Anzueto Valencia, of making up the plot to get rid of the accused conspirators. According to De los Ríos, this is what really happened:

In early September 1934, when Ubico announced a popular referendum to determine whether he should extend his presidential term for another six years, the lawyer Efraín Aguilar Fuentes, the Property Registry director, sternly declined to be in favor of the president. When Ubico summoned him to the presidential office to chastise him, Fuentes coldly replied he was aware Police Chief Anzueto Valencia had embezzled up to twenty eight properties and therefore he, Aguilar, was not going to support the president. But he did not know that Anzueto was only the front man and the real owner was Ubico himself.

In the following weeks, Anzueto Valencia made up a list of people involved in a false plot to murder Ubico Castañeda, and among the people in the list he included Aguilar Fuentes. All the people on the list were imprisoned, tortured and forced to confess. Their &quot;confessions&quot; appeared in the semi-official newspaper &quot;El Liberal Progresista&quot;.

De los Ríos was incarcerated once the government learned about these strong accusations. He remained in the National Penitenciary for most of the rest of Ubico&#x27;s presidency.

==== Congress gift ====
In 1940, the Guatemalan Congress gave Ubico a gift of US$200,000. Nearly 90 people were jailed for criticizing the gift.

===Resignation and continuation===

Ubico&#x27;s repressive policies and arrogant demeanor led to a widespread popular insurrection led by middle-class intellectuals, professionals, and junior army officers. School teacher María Chinchilla Recinos&#x27; death during a peaceful demonstration on 25 June 1944 sparked an outcry that led to Ubico&#x27;s resignation on 1 July 1944, amidst a general strike and nationwide protests. Initially, he had planned to hand over power to the former director of police, General Roderico Anzueto, whom he felt could control. But his advisors recognized that Anzueto&#x27;s pro-Nazi sympathies had made him very unpopular, and that he would not be able to control the military. Instead, Ubico chose to select a triumvirate composed of Major General Buenaventura Piñeda, Major General Eduardo Villagrán Ariza, and General Federico Ponce Vaides.

The three generals promised to convene the national assembly to hold an election for a provisional president, but when congress met on 3 July, soldiers held everyone at gunpoint and forced them to vote for General Ponce, rather than the popular civilian candidate Ramón Calderón. Ponce, who had previously retired from military service due to alcoholism, took orders from Ubico and kept many of the officials who had worked in the Ubico administration. The repressive policies of the Ubico administration continued.

===Revolution and overthrow===
Opposition groups began organizing again, this time joined by many prominent political and military leaders who deemed the Ponce regime unconstitutional. Among the military officers in the opposition were Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán and Major Francisco Javier Arana. Ubico had fired Árbenz from his teaching post at the &quot;Escuela Politécnica&quot; (Politechnic School), and since then Árbenz had been in El Salvador organizing a band of revolutionary exiles. On 19 October 1944, a small group of soldiers and students led by Árbenz and Arana attacked the National Palace, in what later became known as the &quot;October Revolution&quot;. Ponce was defeated and driven into exile. Árbenz, Arana, and a lawyer named Jorge Toriello established a junta which held democratic elections before the end of the year, and were won by a professor named Juan José Arévalo.

==Exile and death==
Ubico went into exile to New Orleans in the United States where he rented a small house and lived off the $200,000 he transferred to a personal bank account. On 14 June 1946, Ubico died of lung cancer at the age of 67. He was buried in the Mount Hope Cemetery in New Orleans.

Efforts to repatriate his remains were denied by the government of Miguel Ydíogoras Fuentes. However, on 13 August 1963, his remains were repatriated to Guatemala after appropriate measures were taken by the government of Enrique Peralta Azurdia and the United States government.

<text>Fur Patrol is a rock band, originally from Wellington, New Zealand.

The band formed in Wellington in 1996. Their debut EP, &quot;Starlifter&quot;, was released on the independent Wellington label Wishbone in 1998. Their debut album &quot;Pet&quot; was produced by David Long, and was released in 2000, also on Wishbone Records. &quot;Pet&quot; featured the single &quot;Lydia&quot; which reached number one on the New Zealand singles charts. The band scooped the pool at the 2001 Tui New Zealand Music Awards, walking away with four Tuis.

In 2001 the band moved to Melbourne, Australia where they signed their first major record deal, with Universal Music Australia. Their second album, Collider, was released in New Zealand in 2003 and Australia in early 2004. The album, produced by British producer Mark Wallis and recorded in Melbourne&#x27;s Sing Sing studios, was a move away from the catchy, more radio-friendly pop sound of &quot;Pet&quot;. The first single, &quot;Precious&quot;, was heavier and darker than earlier offerings. Its music video, which showed the band members collecting fan&#x27;s ears, was filmed in Hollywood.

Fur Patrol became a three-piece when Guitarist Steve Wells left the band in late 2004.

The 3-piece released the 4-track &quot;Long Distance Runner EP&quot; in May 2007 and their third full-length album &quot;Local Kid&quot; on 29 September 2008. &quot;Local Kid&quot; was produced by Australian producer Tony Cohen.

<doc id="272050" wikidata="Q7885263" url="?curid=272050" title="Unintentional radiator">
<text>In United States regulatory law, an unintentional radiator is any device that is designed to use radio frequency electrical signals within itself, or sends radio frequency signals over conducting cabling to other equipment, but is not intended to radiate radio frequency energy. An incidental radiator is a device that can generate radio frequency electrical energy even though it is not intentionally designed to do so. Unintentional and incidental radio frequency radiation can interfere with other electronic devices. In the United States, limits on radiated emissions from unintentional and incidental radiators are established by the Federal Communications Commission. Similar regulations have been promulgated by other governments. Reference is usually made in regulations to technical standards established by organizations such as ANSI, IEC and ITU.

==Example unintentional and incidental radiating devices==
A computer is a typical example of an unintentional radiator. Radio frequency signals used within the computer circuitry may be unintentionally coupled to the power cord or to an interconnecting cable, which then acts as an antenna.

A radio receiver will often use an intermediate frequency which is detectable outside the radio—the concept behind at least one audience measurement concept for roadside detection of radio stations which passing motorists are listening to.

Examples of incidental radiators include electric motors, transformers, dimmers, and corona from electrical powerlines. Radiated emissions from these commonly create interference on AM radio receivers and on television receivers.

==Regulatory overview==
In North America, active devices that are characterized as unintentional radiators are governed by Part 15 of the FCC regulations. In Canada, Innovation, Science and Economic Development considers them as interference-causing Equipment. Globally, most domestic regulation of unintentional radiators are based on ITU recommendations.

Generally, this means the device leaks a signal at some level. Microprocessor-controlled appliances, anything with a clock signal, and switching voltage regulators all make some kind of noise, at the repetition frequency and at harmonics. In most countries, government agencies regulate how much leakage is tolerated. This prevents leakage from cable television systems, for example, from interfering with radio communications between aircraft and control towers.

Because it costs money to filter out noise, there is always a balance struck between regulatory compliance and perfect filtering in these devices. Microwave ovens or devices with microprocessors may leak within allowable limits but may generate an undesired signal that interferes with a licensed communications device. It also generally means that users who intentionally radiate signals (TV stations and cell phone companies) can order the device turned off if it interferes with their licensed operations.
There is an entire industry based on regulatory compliance: manufacturers shipping a product to a foreign country must comply with each country&#x27;s limitations on leakage of interfering signals. For example, in Germany the TÜV issues regulatory rules for unintentional radiators. The big cylindrical bumps on the cable to monitors and laptop chargers are ferrite cores which reduce undesired signals.

<doc id="272053" wikidata="Q7949773" url="?curid=272053" title="WGHR (Georgia)">
<text>WGHR was a noncommercial radio station operated exclusively by the students of Southern Polytechnic State University in Marietta, Georgia, United States. The station was supported by students and its listeners to provide diverse programming and represent its community with a wide variety of musical genres.

==History==
Like many other college radio stations, WGHR began as a carrier current low-power AM station in 1969, transmitting on 1280 kHz from a wire loop antenna situated atop the circle of buildings at the center of the campus. Although it was not an officially assigned callsign, it adopted the name WSTB, an acronym for Southern Tech Broadcasting. Nicknamed &quot;Stubby&quot;, its studio was located in a dormitory.

In the mid-1970s, the station applied for a low-power FM station, initially trying 91.7. However, this application was rejected for being too close to 91.9 (WCLK) and 91.1 (WREK). Ultimately, the station decided on 102.5 and eventually received a construction permit for this frequency in 1979. Since there was already a WSTB FM station in Streetsboro, Ohio, the students selected WGHR to mean &quot;Green Hornet Radio&quot;, after the school&#x27;s mascot. The station&#x27;s nickname was later changed to &quot;Wooger&quot; (mocked by the station&#x27;s own promos later on). After a one-year delay (due to a recalled Harris Broadcast transmitter), it began broadcasting FM in 1981, serving most of the Cobb County area in the northwestern metro Atlanta region.

At that time, it shared an office in the student center with &quot;The Sting&quot;, the student newspaper. In 1993, the expansion and renovation of the building were completed, and it moved from the old office to its own studio. Despite the increased building size, the size of the new station was halved, which was seen by many as a sign of how the station was viewed by the administration. The new facility did, however, include a restroom and a large window into the atrium at the main entrance, which allowed students and visitors to see into the broadcast studio. This is still the station&#x27;s current facility.

==Programming==

Not much is known about what the station broadcast when AM was the predominant method of radio transmission. When it went to FM, the first song it played was Barry Manilow&#x27;s &quot;Looks Like We Made It&quot;, and it continued playing top 40. It gradually moved towards a &quot;college rock&quot; format during the 1980s, and diversified during the early 1990s, which it has continued since.

In 1996, after a DJ went to Canada and heard CBC Radio running the World Radio Network overnight instead of going off-air, the amateur radio club helped revive the satellite dish atop the building. The station then started broadcasting international news from WRN at night, on weekends, and during breaks. SPSU students created a broadcast automation system to manage the station when operators were not present.

==License==
WGHR&#x27;s 17-watt ERP class D (low-power) FM signal was later forced from the air by a sequence of events related to FCC rulings, and the evolution of the commercial band in metro Atlanta.

When WGHR first applied, FM class D stations were considered equal to other full-power stations. That changed in 1980, when the National Association of Broadcasters (representing only large commercial stations), the then-new National Public Radio, and even the Corporation for Public Broadcasting convinced the FCC to demote class D stations to a second-class status, and to stop issuing new class D licenses altogether. The exception was for NPR and NAB-member stations, who could continue building new broadcast translators (also class D) however they liked. While the discrimination against technically identical stations just for originating their own programming seems appalling and unconstitutional to many, these small stations have never had the resources to challenge this in court.

Because of the ruling, WGHR (among many) was left completely vulnerable to any full-power station that wanted its spot on the dial. FCC docket 80-90, introduced in 1980, allowed full-power stations to move in or fill in closer together, forcing many class Ds off the air with no other place to go.

In the Atlanta area, two new docket 80–90 allotments were proposed in the early 1980s, one north of Atlanta on 107.5, and one west-northwest on 102.5: WGHR&#x27;s exact frequency. Five proposals were submitted to the FCC for the latter: one for Forest Park, one for Douglasville, one for Lithia Springs, one for Mableton, and finally WGHR&#x27;s for Marietta, reserved as non-commercial educational (NCE). At the time, the FCC had no rules to level the playing field for NCE stations, so WGHR lost out. The remaining proposals floated around until 1988, when Mableton was selected, and the new allotment was opened for applications. Those applicants battled it out in court for years, until one was finally selected in the mid-1990s.

The allotment of a new class A station at 102.5 MHz in Mableton prompted WGHR to move from that frequency to 100.7 MHz in 1998. When WWWQ (now WNNX) began broadcasting on 100.5 MHz in Atlanta, WGHR moved back to 102.5 temporarily to avoid receiving and causing interference, and an application was filed with the FCC to move to 101.1 MHz. Shortly afterward however, the full-power station WAMJ (now WPZE) began broadcasting, and WGHR was again forced to move. Because they were still licensed for 100.7 MHz, WGHR resumed broadcasting there. The owners of 100.5 (Susquehanna Radio Corporation) strongly objected to this, and consequently, WGHR ceased over-the-air broadcasts in order to avoid trouble with the FCC.

In January 2004, after being unable to broadcast for 12 consecutive months, the FM license for WGHR was automatically canceled by the FCC as required by Congress, and the application to move to 101.1 was dismissed as moot. It continued to webcast, in hopes that the LPFM rules will later be relaxed, allowing it to return to the airwaves.

Southern Polytechnic State University was merged into Kennesaw State University in 2013. WGHR was then dissolved in favor of Owl Radio, the online-only student radio station at KSU.

<doc id="272054" wikidata="Q2905392" url="?curid=272054" title="Weakly compact cardinal">
<text>In mathematics, a weakly compact cardinal is a certain kind of cardinal number introduced by ; weakly compact cardinals are large cardinals, meaning that their existence cannot be proven from the standard axioms of set theory. (Tarski originally called them &quot;not strongly incompact&quot; cardinals.)

Formally, a cardinal κ is defined to be weakly compact if it is uncountable and for every function &quot;f&quot;: [κ] 2 → {0, 1} there is a set of cardinality κ that is homogeneous for &quot;f&quot;. In this context, [κ] 2 means the set of 2-element subsets of κ, and a subset &quot;S&quot; of κ is homogeneous for &quot;f&quot; if and only if either all of [&quot;S&quot;]2 maps to 0 or all of it maps to 1.

The name &quot;weakly compact&quot; refers to the fact that if a cardinal is weakly compact then a certain related infinitary language satisfies a version of the compactness theorem; see below. 

== Equivalent formulations ==

The following are equivalent for any uncountable cardinal κ:

# κ is weakly compact.
# for every λ&lt;κ, natural number n ≥ 2, and function f: [κ]n → λ, there is a set of cardinality κ that is homogeneous for f. 
# κ is inaccessible and has the tree property, that is, every tree of height κ has either a level of size κ or a branch of size κ.
# Every linear order of cardinality κ has an ascending or a descending sequence of order type κ. (W. W. Comfort, S. Negrepontis, &quot;The Theory of Ultrafilters&quot;, p.185)
# κ is formula_1-indescribable.
# κ has the extension property. In other words, for all &quot;U&quot; ⊂ &quot;V&quot;κ there exists a transitive set &quot;X&quot; with κ ∈ &quot;X&quot;, and a subset &quot;S&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot;, such that (&quot;V&quot;κ, ∈, &quot;U&quot;) is an elementary substructure of (&quot;X&quot;, ∈, &quot;S&quot;). Here, &quot;U&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are regarded as unary predicates.
# For every set S of cardinality κ of subsets of κ, there is a non-trivial κ-complete filter that decides S.
# κ is κ-unfoldable.
# κ is inaccessible and the infinitary language &quot;L&quot;κ,κ satisfies the weak compactness theorem. 
# κ is inaccessible and the infinitary language &quot;L&quot;κ,ω satisfies the weak compactness theorem.
# κ is inaccessible and for every transitive set formula_2 of cardinality κ with κ formula_3, formula_4, and satisfying a sufficiently large fragment of ZFC, there is an elementary embedding formula_5 from formula_2 to a transitive set formula_7 of cardinality κ such that formula_8, with critical point formula_9κ. 
# formula_10 (formula_11 defined as formula_12) and every formula_13-complete filter of a formula_13-complete field of sets of cardinality formula_15 is contained in a formula_13-complete ultrafilter. (W. W. Comfort, S. Negrepontis, &quot;The Theory of Ultrafilters&quot;, p.185)
# formula_13 has Alexander&#x27;s property, i.e. for any space formula_18 with a formula_13-subbase formula_20 with cardinality formula_15, and every cover of formula_18 by elements of formula_20 has a subcover of cardinality formula_24, then formula_18 is formula_13-compact. (W. W. Comfort, S. Negrepontis, &quot;The Theory of Ultrafilters&quot;, p.182--185)
# formula_27 is formula_13-compact. (W. W. Comfort, S. Negrepontis, &quot;The Theory of Ultrafilters&quot;, p.185)

A language &quot;L&quot;κ,κ is said to satisfy the weak compactness theorem if whenever Σ is a set of sentences of cardinality at most κ and every subset with less than κ elements has a model, then Σ has a model. Strongly compact cardinals are defined in a similar way without the restriction on the cardinality of the set of sentences.

==Properties==

Every weakly compact cardinal is a reflecting cardinal, and is also a limit of reflecting cardinals. This means also that weakly compact cardinals are Mahlo cardinals, and the set of Mahlo cardinals less than a given weakly compact cardinal is stationary.

If formula_13 is weakly compact, then there are chains of well-founded elementary end-extensions of formula_30 of arbitrary length formula_31.p.6

Weakly compact cardinals remain weakly compact in formula_32. Assuming V = L, a cardinal is weakly compact iff it is 2-stationary.

<text>The national flag of the Republic of Moldova () is a vertical triband of blue, yellow, and red, charged with the coat of arms of Moldova (an eagle holding a shield charged with an aurochs) on the centre bar. The reverse is mirrored. The flag ratio is 1:2. Until further provisions, the State Flag of Moldova is used as the national flag and ensign as well; that is, civil, state and war flag and ensign.

The blue-yellow-red tricolour of Moldova is based on the flag of Romania, reflecting the two countries&#x27; national and cultural affinity. On Moldova&#x27;s flag, the yellow stripe is charged with the national arms. Like the Romanian coat of arms, the Moldovan arms, adopted in 1990, features a dark golden eagle holding an Orthodox Christian cross in its beak. Instead of a sword, the eagle is holding an olive branch, symbolising peace. The blue and red shield on the eagle&#x27;s chest is charged with the traditional symbols of Moldova: an aurochs&#x27; head, flanked by a rose in dexter and a crescent in sinister and having a star between its horns, all of gold.

==Colors==

Until 2010, the color shades of the Moldavian flag were not explicitly named. The Regulation regarding the flag stated that the colors of the flag must match the ones shown in the annex. Moldavian heraldist and vexillologist Silviu Andrieș-Tabac stated in an interview that in 1990, when the flag was being created, &quot;it was taken into account that many countries have similar tricolor flags. As a result, it was decided to abandon the ultramarine blue, which is present on the Romanian flag, in favor of the emerald-blue, used on the mural paintings of Voroneț monastery...&quot;.

The French &quot;Album des pavillons nationaux et des marques distinctives&quot; (2000) by Armand du Payrat and Daniel Roudaut had suggested the following Pantone nuances, including those of the coat of arms: blue 549, yellow 143, red 186, green 340 and brown 464.

However, a new law from 2010 defined the colors of the flag as &quot;Berlin blue&quot;, &quot;chrome yellow&quot; and &quot;vermillon red&quot;. The exact matches, according to annex no. 2, are as follows:

==Governmental flags==

===Governmental standards===

In 2010 four new governmental standards, derived from the state flag, were established. The standard of the minister of defense has yet to be defined, its temporary replacement being the state flag. The other three standards, of the president, president of the Parliament and prime minister, are described as follows:

A square flag with the coat of arms of Moldova on center, whose &quot;aquila&quot; is golden (instead of dark gold, or brown). The flag has a border of squares, each one measuring of the flag&#x27;s width and following the pattern blue-yellow-red-yellow. The background of the flag is purple for the president, red for the president of the Parliament and blue for the prime minister.

The original flags are kept in their respective offices. Duplicates are hoisted on the official residences when the people entitled to them are inside; also on their respective cars.

The design of the standard of the minister of defense and regulations concerning its use is also provided for by Decree No. 1194 of 17 June 2014.

===Other governmental flags===

Several governmental organizations have flags established by parliamentary or governmental decisions:
* The Department of Civil Defense and Exceptional Situations of Moldova
* The Customs of Moldova
* The Border Guard of Moldova
* The Information and Security Service of Moldova
* Principal State Inspectorate for Technical Supervising of Dangerous Industrial Objects
==Military flags==

The flag of the National Army of the Republic of Moldova represents a unique military vexillologic insignia. It is the symbol of the military glory, of the tradition and continuity, honor and loyalty of the soldiers and officers to the country.

The cloth of the flag has the same chromatics as the state flag of the Republic of Moldova. Its partition reminds of the old Moldavian military flags, from 1834 to 1863. The red central cross reminds of Saint George, the patron and protector of the medieval Moldavian army. The motto &quot;Pentru Onoare! Pentru Patrie! Pentru Tricolor!&quot; represents the belief of the Moldovan soldiers.

The military colours of the Moldavian Army units consists of the state flag, measuring 825×1650 mm, with golden fringes and tassels, having the unit&#x27;s battle cry inscribed on obverse, above the coat of arms, and the unit&#x27;s name on reverse, below the coat of arms. The flag is fixed on a wooden rod, measuring 2500 mm, with a standard pole on top. Previous regulation, which hasn&#x27;t been explicitly repealed in 2010, described the inscriptions on the flag as follows: on obverse, above the coat of arms, &quot;&quot; (&quot;For our Fatherland&quot;), and below &quot;&quot; (&quot;Republic of Moldova&quot;); on reverse, above the coat of arms, the unit&#x27;s name.

The military colours, as well as their regulations, are issued by decree of the president of Moldova.

The military colours of the units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are reproducing the state flag, with golden fringes and tassels, having the motto &quot;&quot; (&quot;For Fatherland&quot;) inscribed on obverse, above the coat of arms, and the text &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Moldova&quot;) on reverse, below the top margin. Also, on reverse, above the coat of arms, is inscribed the name of the unit, all letters being embroidered with golden thread.

==Flag Day==

Since April 2010, the Flag Day of Moldova is celebrated on 27 April each year. On this day in 1990, the tricolor was officially adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Moldavian SSR as the state flag of the country.

== History ==
The current flag of Moldova was created in 1990 and is based on the national colors of Romanians, the blue-yellow-red tricolor. The reverse side differed from the Romanian flag in proportion, and by having a lighter blue.

The flag of Moldova was one of the national flags with differing obverse and reverse sides — the others being the flags of Paraguay. Although the reverse of the flag was officially stated as not containing any coat of arms, Moldovan flags with a coat of arms printed on the reverse were also used.

On 26 November 2010, a new law regarding the State Flag of Moldova became effective. One of the most important provisions has the reverse defined as a mirrored image of the obverse.

The flags of the Moldavian Democratic Republic (MDR) and some of the proposed flags for the Republic of Moldova display the head of an aurochs, which is derived from the flag and coat of arms of Moldavia.

<doc id="272063" wikidata="Q1117970" url="?curid=272063" title="Component (thermodynamics)">
<text>In thermodynamics, a component is one of a collection of chemically independent constituents of a system. The number of components represents the minimum number of independent chemical species necessary to define the composition of all phases of the system.

Calculating the number of components in a system is necessary when applying Gibbs&#x27; phase rule in determination of the number of degrees of freedom of a system.

The number of components is equal to the number of distinct chemical species (constituents), minus the number of chemical reactions between them, minus the number of any constraints (like charge neutrality or balance of molar quantities).

==Calculation==
Suppose that a chemical system has elements and chemical species (elements or compounds). The latter are combinations of the former, and each species can be represented as a sum of elements:
:formula_1
where are the integers denoting number of atoms of element in molecule . Each species is determined by a vector (a row of this matrix), but the rows are not necessarily linearly independent. If the rank of the matrix is , then there are linearly independent vectors, and the remaining vectors can be obtained by adding up multiples of those vectors. The chemical species represented by those vectors are &quot;components&quot; of the system.

If, for example, the species are C (in the form of graphite), CO2 and CO, then
:formula_2
Since CO can be expressed as CO = (1/2)C + (1/2)CO2, it is not independent and C and CO can be chosen as the components of the system.

There are two ways that the vectors can be dependent. One is that some pairs of elements always appear in the same ratio in each species. An example is a series of polymers that are composed of different numbers of identical units. The number of such constraints is given by . In addition, some combinations of elements may be forbidden by chemical kinetics. If the number of such constraints is , then
:formula_3
Equivalently, if is the number of independent reactions that can take place, then
:formula_4
The constants are related by .

==Examples==
===CaCO3 - CaO - CO2 system===
This is an example of a system with several phases, which at ordinary temperatures are two solids and a gas. There are three chemical species (CaCO3, CaO and CO2) and one reaction:

: CaCO3 CaO + CO2. 

The number of components is then 3 - 1 = 2.

===Water - Hydrogen - Oxygen system===
The reactions included in the calculation are only those that actually occur under the given conditions, and not those that might occur under different conditions such as higher temperature or the presence of a catalyst. For example, the dissociation of water into its elements does not occur at ordinary temperature, so a system of water, hydrogen and oxygen at 25 °C has 3 independent components.

=== Aqueous solution of 4 kinds of salts ===
Consider an aqueous solution containing sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), sodium bromide (NaBr), and potassium bromide (KBr), in equilibrium with their respective solid phases. While 6 elements are present (H, O, Na, K, Cl, Br), their quantities are not independent due to the following constraints:

* The stoichiometry of water: n(H) = 2n(O). This constraint imply that knowing the quantity of one determines the other.
* Charge balance in the solution: n(Na) + n(K) = n(Cl) + n(Br). Thin constraint imply that knowing the quantity of 3 of the 4 ionic species (Na, K, Cl, Br) determines the fourth. 

Consequently, the number of independently variable constituents, and therefore the number of components, is 4.

<doc id="272064" wikidata="Q3445053" url="?curid=272064" title="Southern Polytechnic State University">
<text>Southern Polytechnic State University (also called Southern Poly; abbreviated SPSU) was a public, co-educational, state university in Marietta, Georgia, United States approximately northwest of downtown Atlanta. Until 2015, it was an independent part of the University System of Georgia and called itself &quot;Georgia&#x27;s Technology University.&quot;

Southern Tech was founded in 1948 as The Technical Institute in Chamblee, Georgia by Blake R. Van Leer. The first classes were held with 116 students. It was renamed the Southern Technical Institute in 1949 and moved to its present campus in Marietta, Georgia in 1962. It went through another name change in 1987 and became the Southern College of Technology. In the summer of 1996, the university adopted its polytechnic name. It was one among a small group of polytechnic universities in the United States that tend to be primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences.

On November 1, 2013, plans were announced by the Georgia Board of Regents for Southern Polytechnic and Kennesaw State University to be consolidated into one university. On January 6, 2015, the Georgia Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia approved the consolidation of Southern Poly and Kennesaw State, with Kennesaw State as the surviving institution. On July 1, 2015, Kennesaw State established the Southern Polytechnic College of Engineering and Engineering Technology in honor of the former SPSU.

== History ==

===Establishment===
After World War II, the need for technicians spiked due to a major economic shift in Georgia from being a largely agricultural state to one that is more industry heavy. The new industries required technicians to bridge the growing gap between engineers and craftsmen, effectively the gap between research/development and building/implementing. At the time, most technical institutes in the United States were in the northeastern states; thus the need for a technical institute in the south was great.

In response to the growing demand, the president of the Georgia Institute of Technology, Colonel Blake R. Van Leer, sought to establish a technical institute program in Georgia. In 1945 he was approached by the Associated Industries of Georgia (AIG) who shared their common desire to have such a program and offered Van Leer their support. It took years for Van Leer to convince the Board of Regents to give Georgia Tech authorization to establish a technical institute. On October 8, 1947, the authorization was granted. The location chosen for the fledgling institute was a Naval Air Station in Chamblee, GA, which eventually became the site of DeKalb–Peachtree Airport. The first director was to be Professor Lawrence V. Johnson, and it was going to open under the name of The Technical Institute. On March 24, 1948, The Technical Institute held registration for the spring quarter and 116 students enrolled (all but 10 World War II veterans), including one young woman named Barbara Hudson. The institute had a staff of 12.

===Progression===

In 1949, The Technical Institute became the Southern Technical Institute and was recognized as a college-level school by the U.S. Department of Education. Twelve years later, the college migrated to its present campus in Marietta, Georgia, which was previously part of Dobbins Air Reserve Base. The General Lucius D. Clay National Guard Center (then known as Naval Air Station Atlanta) also moved to the opposite (south) end of Dobbins Air Reserve Base around the same time. In 1961, Hoyt McClure was named acting director and led the movement to build eight new buildings on of land.

The Southern Technical Institute became accredited as a four-year college in 1970 and was one of the first colleges in the nation to offer the Bachelor of Engineering Technology degree. It also earned independence in the University System of Georgia, separating ties with Georgia Tech. In the summer of 1980, the college officially became the fourteenth senior college and the thirty-third independent unit of the University System of Georgia. The college&#x27;s first president, Dr. Stephen R. Cheshier of Purdue University, was named in that same year. He saw the college through two name changes — Southern College of Technology (often called Southern Tech) in 1987 and Southern Polytechnic State University in the summer of 1996, when the school became a university. Dr. Cheshier retired as president of the university in June 1997. Dr. Daniel S. Papp served as interim president from July 1997 to August 1998, when the university welcomed Dr. Lisa Rossbacher, formerly of Dickinson College, as its president.

In 2005, Georgia Highlands College established a satellite campus hosted on the SPSU campus.

=== USG Merger ===
Eleven days before its planned vote, the Georgia Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia announced plans to consolidate Southern Polytechnic State University and Kennesaw State University into one university. Given that public comments are only allowed with fifteen days notice the Regents consolidation plans were perceived as a deceitful and secretive move by faculty and students. The presidents of the two universities were not told of the consolidation plans until &quot;a week and a half&quot; before the public announcement. Reasons given for the consolidation effort focused on cost savings despite the merger of eight other colleges into four only saving an estimated 0.1%.

=== Post-consolidation ===
Since the completion of the merger several scandals have plagued the newly augmented Kennesaw State. Less than two years after the consolidation President Dan Papp announced that he was stepping down as president of the university. His replacement, Sam Olens, was appointed amidst controversy over his total lack of education experience or background. This appointment came on the heels of an audit that revealed that outgoing president Papp had violated financial policy in receiving more than a half million dollars in early retirement payment. Before Papp&#x27;s retirement announcement a seven-figure embezzlement scheme was uncovered and five KSU staffers and contractors were arrested. The amount lost equated to nearly 15% of the merger-based savings of 2013.

==Campus==

;Student housing
:Dormitory facilities were provided at Southern Tech&#x27;s first location in Chamblee, Georgia. They were created from former bachelor officers&#x27; quarters in facilities leased from the Atlanta Naval Air Station. When the campus moved in Marietta, housing was provided in residences originally built to house employees at the Bell Bomber plant (now the Lockheed Martin facility). The facilities were at that time being managed by the Marietta Housing Authority as low-income residences and were known as &quot;Marietta Place.&quot; Construction for the Marietta campus&#x27; first dormitory began in 1964. The campus dormitories housed only men until 1974, when one end of the fourth floor of Howell dormitory was renovated for use by female students.

:At the time of its merger with Kennesaw State University, Southern Polytechnic State University had five on-campus housing facilities for its students. These were Howell Hall, Hornet Village suites, University Commons apartments, University Courtyard apartments, and University Columns houses. These facilities are still used to house Kennesaw State University students.

;Joe Mack Wilson Student Center (A Building)
:The Joe Mack Wilson Student Center is located near the front entrance on the northern side of campus. It includes resources such as a University bookstore, a game room, eateries, various lounge areas, and many of KSU&#x27;s departments and offices. Historically, it also housed student organizations and the WGHR radio station

;Engineering Technology Center (Q Building)
:On January 24, 2008, Governor Sunny Purdue recommended a little over $33 million toward the construction of a new building to house five programs: Electrical Engineering Technology, Computer Engineering Technology, Telecommunications Engineering Technology, Mechanical Engineering Technology, and Mechatronics Engineering. The facility, the Engineering Technology Center, covers and contains 36 labs, 12 classrooms, two seminar rooms, and a 200-seat lecture room. It was completed in December of 2010; it opened on the first day of classes for the spring semester of 2011. It is on the western side of the campus – north of the parking deck and Stingers Restaurant.

==Organization and administration==
===Faculty and staff===
At the time of its consolidation with KSU, faculty at Southern Polytechnic State University were at a ratio of about 1 faculty member per 19 students. About 42.5% of students attended classes with fewer than 20 students. Every faculty member was required to have experience in relevant work or research of a topic to be qualified to teach at the school.

Between 2006, there was a general 70% to 30% ratio of male to female professors. In 2007–2008 male professors made up to $7,000 more than female professors on average. The gap between the difference in pay quickly decreased and by the 2009–2010 academic year the salary only differed by $300, $77,699 for males and $77,410 for females. Of the 48 full-time professors in 2007, 52% of them had tenure. The number of professors dropped from 48 to 44 in 2008; with the drop of full-time professors, only 44% of full-time faculty had tenure. It was recorded in 2010, that the number of full-time professors dropped again to 39, but the tenure rate remained the same.
There were many awards given out at SPSU among the faculty including the Outstanding Faculty Award and the Employee Service Award. The university would choose a select group of faculty whose achievements had been noteworthy enough to receive the OFA. The OFA committee changed each year and was made up of the previous year&#x27;s recipients. The Employee Service Award acknowledged the service and achievement of permanent employees at periodic intervals with appropriate ceremony and awards. A committee composed of representatives from the Staff Council and the Outstanding Faculty Awards Committee determined who received the awards and the ceremony date. Both awards were given out at the same ceremony at the end of spring term.

===Student government===
The SPSU Student Government Association was composed of elected and appointed undergraduate and graduate students. According to the organization&#x27;s constitution, the mission of the Student Government Association was as follows:

==Academics==
Southern Polytechnic State University offered a broad range of undergraduate degree programs and several master&#x27;s degree programs through its four schools and its Division of Engineering. At the time of its consolidation with KSU, it offered 24 online certificate, graduate, and undergraduate degree programs as well as the &quot;eCore&quot; program which was made up of the first two years of college courses completely online and is composed primarily of core classes.

===Undergraduate programs===
Southern Polytechnic State University&#x27;s academic divisions were made of its School of Architecture and Construction Management; School of Computing and Software Engineering; School of Engineering Technology and Management; School of Arts and Sciences; and Division of Engineering. The most popular programs of study for undergraduate students are Architecture, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering Technology, and Mechanical Engineering. The university&#x27;s construction engineering program was one of nine in the nation, and its mechatronics engineering program was the first in Georgia. Other unique programs at SPSU included a five-year professionally accredited architecture degree and undergraduate degrees in surveying and mapping, systems engineering, and technical communication.

SPSU followed the University System of Georgia&#x27;s Common Core program.

===Graduate programs===
At the time of consolidation, SPSU offered eleven graduate degree programs, nine graduate certificate programs, and four advanced graduate certificate programs. The eleven graduate programs awarded master&#x27;s degrees in Accounting, Business Administration, Computer Science, Construction Management, Electrical Engineering Technology, Information and Instructional Design, Information Design and Communication, Information Technology, Quality Assurance, Software Engineering, and Systems Engineering. The university has been offering many of its master&#x27;s degrees online since 1997.

===Special learning opportunities===
Southern Polytechnic State University offered special learning opportunities including teacher certification, distance learning, and study abroad programs. The university featured cross-enrollment programs with the Georgia Institute of Technology that enabled SPSU students to participate in the Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps, Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps, and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps programs hosted at the Georgia Institute of Technology&#x27;s campus.

===University Honors Program===
The Southern Polytechnic State University University Honors Program offered the students smaller classroom, research studies with the professors, a separate study room, and more intellectual rigor. To join the program, students were required to have a minimum GPA of 3.2 at the freshman or sophomore level, 3.3 at the junior level, or 3.4 at the senior level. The University Honors Program offered two types of honors degrees:
* University Honors Scholar degree required 12 credit hours of honors course work and 6 credit hours of upper-division honors course work. 
* Departmental Honors Scholar degree required completion of 6 hours of enriched upper-division coursework or directed study.

===Rankings===
According to the American Society for Engineering Education, in its 2010 edition of &quot;Profiles of Engineering and Engineering Technology Colleges&quot;, Southern Polytechnic State University was ranked third for the most engineering technology degrees awarded in the United States from 2001 to 2010 in total and third in the number awarded to female graduates in that same time. The university ranked second in the nation in total enrollment of students in engineering technology degree programs. In 2010, the school was ranked as one of the toughest universities in the U.S. as reported by CBS News.

==Student life==
===Student media===
Southern Polytechnic historically had three student-run media outlets: a college radio station, a student newspaper, and a yearbook.

WGHR (Green Hornet Radio), the campus radio station, was a non-commercial educational station that began as &quot;WSTB&quot; in 1969 on carrier current AM, then became licensed as WGHR at 102.5 on the FM dial in 1981, moving to 100.7 in 1998. The station&#x27;s broadcast license was canceled in 2001 because two commercial radio stations were allowed to take those FM frequencies, without compensation to the station or the school. WGHR continued to webcast after the cancellation. The station&#x27;s radio studios and office were located in the student center. According to the SPSU Student Handbook, WGHR offered interested students an opportunity to gain broadcast and technical experience.

Southern Tech&#x27;s first student newspaper was published under the title &quot;The Technician&quot; in September 1948. The publication changed titles several times, first to &quot;The Engineering Technician&quot; (beginning with the issue of February 20, 1964), then &quot;Whatsizname?&quot; (beginning with the issue of September 24, 1973), &quot;Southern Seeds&quot; (only one issue on October 15, 1975); &quot;Unnamed&quot; (styled &quot;?&quot;, two issues beginning October 22, 1975), and finally &quot;The Sting&quot; (beginning with the issue of November 5, 1975). With the consolidation of Kennesaw State University and Southern Polytechnic State University in January 2015, student publications were integrated, and &quot;The Sting&quot; merged with KSU&#x27;s publication &quot;The Talon&quot; to create a new campus lifestyle publication (published under the title &quot;The Sting&quot;. &quot;The Sting&quot; was later retitled &quot;The Peak&quot; with the September 2016 issue.

&quot;The Technician&#x27;s Log&quot; (often shortened to &quot;The Log&quot;) was the yearbook from 1949 to 1997.

===Student organizations===
;Fraternities and sororities
At the time of its merger with KSU, Southern Polytechnic State University was home to fourteen fraternities and sororities: seven of the North American Interfraternity Conference (IFC), two of the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), and five of the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC).

===Bathtub race===
In the 1960s one of the fraternities at Southern Polytechnic converted a cast-iron bath tub into a cooler for parties. When the tub became difficult to move they attached wheels to it. Some time after, other fraternities acquired their own cast-iron tubs, attached wheels, and the fraternities began to hold races around the perimeter of the school. In light of a growing liability risk the school ended the annual tub races in the early 1990s. In 2010 the SPSU alumni group resurrected the Bathtub Race, under the stipulation that the tubs be motorless.

===Recreational===
Southern Polytechnic State University offered intramural and club sports, which included many team and individual competitive programs throughout the year. Intramural sports consisted of basketball, racquetball, dodgeball, soccer, softball, and volleyball. The club sports are organized by individuals and groups on Southern Polytechnic&#x27;s campus.

The recreational sports practices and competitions took place in the Recreation and Wellness Center, the Outdoor Recreation Complex, the Athletic Gymnasium, and Walter J. Kelly Jr. Field. The Recreation and Wellness Center opened in 1996.

==Athletics==
The Southern Poly (SPSU) athletic teams were called the Runnin&#x27; Hornets, although &quot;&quot;Runnin&#x27; Hornets&quot; is often shortened to &quot;Hornets&quot;&quot; in use. The university was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Southern States Athletic Conference (SSAC; formerly known as Georgia–Alabama–Carolina Conference (GACC) until after the 2003–04 school year) from 1999–2000 to 2013–14. The university&#x27;s mascot was Sting, a green and black, anthropomorphic hornet bearing the stylized version of the university&#x27;s logo on its chest.

SPSU competed in four intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports included baseball, basketball and soccer; while women&#x27;s sports included basketball.

=== Men&#x27;s soccer ===
The soccer team was established in 2007. After not receiving a tournament bid in the first season, the Hornets subsequently received three consecutive NAIA tournament berths. In its most notable season of 2009–2010, Southern Polytechnic State University&#x27;s soccer team went 14–2–1 and went to the NAIA tournament. The team made it past the first round defeating Bryan College but lost in the round of 16 to Martin Methodist.

=== Baseball ===
The baseball team went 53–10 in the 2009 regular season, won the SSAC conference championship, and finished fifth in the NAIA World Series. Three players from the team were drafted by major league baseball teams (the Baltimore Orioles, Philadelphia Phillies, and Florida Marlins). Former players have also signed with other professional organizations such as the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds, and Chicago Cubs.

In 2014, the SPSU baseball team won the SSAC conference tournament. The team also won the Daytona Beach first round regional, earning a trip to the Avista NAIA World Series in the school&#x27;s final year of collegiate athletics.

=== Men&#x27;s basketball ===
In 2009, the men&#x27;s basketball team went 23–5 in the regular season and 12–2 in the conference. They reached the SSAC tournament and won three straight games to become SSAC Champions. They qualified for the NAIA tournament, where they won three straight games before losing in the final four to Azusa Pacific University.

During the 2009 season, many of the athletes on the men&#x27;s basketball team received personal awards. Jas Rogers won the award for the 2009–2010 SSAC Player of the Year. Brent Jennings, Xavier Dawson, and Jas Rogers were voted to the SSAC All-Conference Team, Darrien Beacham was voted to the 2010 Musco Lighting Champion of Character Team, and Jordan Lemons was voted to the SSAC All-Academic Team.

=== Women&#x27;s basketball ===
In 2009, women&#x27;s basketball went 26–4 in the regular season and 12–4 in the conference. They won the SSAC tournament championship and went on to the NAIA tournament. They won the first game but lost the next one to Union University.

During the 2009 season, many of the athletes on the women&#x27;s basketball received personal awards. Athlete Crystal Davis was awarded the NAIA Scholar-Athlete and All-Academic Team awards, Brittany White was voted to the All-Freshmen Team, Dione Parks and Marisa Stoler were voted to the All-Conference Team, and the 6th Man Award was given to Dione Parks. The Newcomer of the Year award was awarded to Marisa Stoler, and Aurielle Morgan Musco was voted to Lighting Champion of Character Team. Also, the Coach of the Year award was awarded to Coach Nathan Teymer.

<text>Abū Yūsuf Yaʻqūb ibn ʼIsḥāq aṣ-Ṣabbāḥ al-Kindī (; ; ; ) was an Arab Muslim polymath active as a philosopher, mathematician, physician, and music theorist. Al-Kindi was the first of the Islamic peripatetic philosophers, and is hailed as the &quot;father of Arab philosophy&quot;.

Al-Kindi was born in Kufa and educated in Baghdad. He became a prominent figure in the House of Wisdom, and a number of Abbasid Caliphs appointed him to oversee the translation of Greek scientific and philosophical texts into the Arabic language. This contact with &quot;the philosophy of the ancients&quot; (as Hellenistic philosophy was often referred to by Muslim scholars) had a profound effect on him, as he synthesized, adapted and promoted Hellenistic and Peripatetic philosophy in the Muslim world. He subsequently wrote hundreds of original treatises of his own on a range of subjects ranging from metaphysics, ethics, logic and psychology, to medicine, pharmacology, mathematics, astronomy, astrology and optics, and further afield to more practical topics like perfumes, swords, jewels, glass, dyes, zoology, tides, mirrors, meteorology and earthquakes.

In the field of mathematics, al-Kindi played an important role in introducing Hindu numerals to the Islamic world, and their further development into Arabic numerals along with al-Khwarizmi which eventually was adopted by the rest of the world. Al-Kindi was also one of the fathers of cryptography. Building on the work of al-Khalil (717–786), Al-Kindi&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages&quot; gave rise to the birth of cryptanalysis, was the earliest known use of statistical inference, and introduced several new methods of breaking ciphers, notably frequency analysis. He was able to create a scale that would enable doctors to gauge the effectiveness of their medication by combining his knowledge of mathematics and medicine.

The central theme underpinning al-Kindi&#x27;s philosophical writings is the compatibility between philosophy and other &quot;orthodox&quot; Islamic sciences, particularly theology, and many of his works deal with subjects that theology had an immediate interest in. These include the nature of God, the soul and prophetic knowledge.

==Early life==
Al-Kindi was born in Kufa to an aristocratic family of the Arabian tribe of the Kinda, descended from the chieftain al-Ash&#x27;ath ibn Qays, a contemporary of Muhammad. The family belonged to the most prominent families of the tribal nobility of Kufa in the early Islamic period, until it lost much of its power following the revolt of Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath. His father Ishaq was the governor of Basra and al-Kindi received his preliminary education there. He later went to complete his studies in Baghdad, where he was patronized by the Abbasid caliphs al-Ma&#x27;mun () and al-Mu&#x27;tasim (). On account of his learning and aptitude for study, al-Ma&#x27;mun appointed him to the House of Wisdom, a recently established center for the translation of Greek philosophical and scientific texts, in Baghdad. He was also well known for his beautiful calligraphy, and at one point was employed as a calligrapher by Caliph al-Mutawakkil (). 

When al-Ma&#x27;mun died, his brother, al-Mu&#x27;tasim became caliph. Al-Kindi&#x27;s position would be enhanced under al-Mu&#x27;tasim, who appointed him as a tutor to his son. But on the accession of al-Wathiq (), and especially of al-Mutawakkil, al-Kindi&#x27;s star waned. There are various theories concerning this: some attribute al-Kindi&#x27;s downfall to scholarly rivalries at the House of Wisdom; others refer to al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s often violent persecution of unorthodox Muslims (as well as of non-Muslims); at one point al-Kindi was beaten and his library temporarily confiscated. Henry Corbin, an authority on Islamic studies, says that in 873, al-Kindi died &quot;a lonely man&quot;, in Baghdad during the reign of al-Mu&#x27;tamid (). 

After his death, al-Kindi&#x27;s philosophical works quickly fell into obscurity; many were lost even to later Islamic scholars and historians. Felix Klein-Franke suggests several reasons for this: aside from the militant orthodoxy of al-Mutawakkil, the Mongols also destroyed countless libraries during their invasion of Persia and Mesopotamia. However, he says the most probable cause of this was that his writings never found popularity amongst subsequent influential philosophers such as al-Farabi and Avicenna, who ultimately overshadowed him. His philosophical career peaked under al-Mu&#x27;tasim, to whom al-Kindi dedicated his most famous work, &quot;On First Philosophy&quot;, and whose son Ahmad was tutored by al-Kindi.

==Accomplishments==
According to Arab bibliographer Ibn al-Nadim, al-Kindi wrote at least two hundred and sixty books, contributing heavily to geometry (thirty-two books), medicine and philosophy (twenty-two books each), logic (nine books), and physics (twelve books). Although most of his books have been lost over the centuries, a few have survived in the form of Latin translations by Gerard of Cremona, and others have been rediscovered in Arabic manuscripts; most importantly, twenty-four of his lost works were located in the mid-twentieth century in a Turkish library.

===Philosophy===
His greatest contribution to the development of Islamic philosophy was his efforts to make Greek thought both accessible and acceptable to a Muslim audience. Al-Kindi carried out this mission from the House of Wisdom (Bayt al-Hikma), an institute of translation and learning patronized by the Abbasid Caliphs, in Baghdad. As well as translating many important texts, much of what was to become standard Arabic philosophical vocabulary originated with al-Kindi; indeed, if it had not been for him, the work of philosophers like al-Farabi, Avicenna, and al-Ghazali might not have been possible.

In his writings, one of al-Kindi&#x27;s central concerns was to demonstrate the compatibility between philosophy and natural theology on the one hand, and revealed or speculative theology on the other (though in fact he rejected speculative theology). Despite this, he did make clear that he believed revelation was a superior source of knowledge to reason because it guaranteed matters of faith that reason could not uncover. And while his philosophical approach was not always original, and was even considered clumsy by later thinkers (mainly because he was the first philosopher writing in the Arabic language), he successfully incorporated Aristotelian and (especially) neo-Platonist thought into an Islamic philosophical framework. This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world.

===Astronomy===
Al-Kindi took his view of the solar system from Ptolemy, who placed the Earth at the centre of a series of concentric spheres, in which the known heavenly bodies (the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and the stars) are embedded. In one of his treatises on the subject, he says that these bodies are rational entities, whose circular motion is in obedience to and worship of God. Their role, al-Kindi believes, is to act as instruments for divine providence. He furnishes empirical evidence as proof for this assertion; different seasons are marked by particular arrangements of the planets and stars (most notably the sun); the appearance and manner of people varies according to the arrangement of heavenly bodies situated above their homeland.

However, he is ambiguous when it comes to the actual process by which the heavenly bodies affect the material world. One theory he posits in his works is from Aristotle, who conceived that the movement of these bodies causes friction in the sub-lunar region, which stirs up the primary elements of earth, fire, air and water, and these combine to produce everything in the material world. An alternative view found in the treatise &quot;On Rays&quot; (&quot;De radiis&quot;) is that the planets exercise their influence in straight lines; but this treatise, written by a Latin author, probably around the middle of the 13th century, is apocryphal. In each of these, two fundamentally different views of physical interaction are presented; action by contact and action at a distance. This dichotomy is duplicated in his writings on optics.

Some of the notable astrological works by al-Kindi include:
*&quot;The Book of the Judgement of the Stars&quot;, including &quot;The Forty Chapters&quot;, on questions and elections.
*&quot;On the Stellar Rays&quot; (spurious)
*Several epistles on weather and meteorology, including &quot;De mutatione temporum&quot;, (&quot;On the Changing of the Weather&quot;).
*Treatise on the Judgement of Eclipses.
*Treatise on the Dominion of the Arabs and its Duration (used to predict the end of Arab rule).
*&quot;The Choices of Days&quot; (on elections).
*&quot;On the Revolutions of the Years&quot; (on mundane astrology and natal revolutions).
*&quot;De Signis Astronomiae Applicitis as Mediciam&quot; &#x27;On the Signs of Astronomy as applied to Medicine&#x27;
*&quot;Treatise on the Spirituality of the Planets&quot;.

===Optics===

Al-Kindi was the first major writer on optics since antiquity. Roger Bacon placed him in the first rank after Ptolemy as a writer on the topic. In the apocryphal work known as &quot;De radiis stellarum&quot;, is developed the theory &quot;that everything in the world ... emits rays in every direction, which fill the whole world.&quot; This theory of the active power of rays had an influence on later scholars such as Ibn al-Haytham, Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon.

Two major theories of optics appear in the writings of al-Kindi: Aristotelian and Euclidean. Aristotle had believed that in order for the eye to perceive an object, both the eye and the object must be in contact with a transparent medium (such as air) that is filled with light. When these criteria are met, the &quot;sensible form&quot; of the object is transmitted through the medium to the eye. On the other hand, Euclid proposed that vision occurred in straight lines when &quot;rays&quot; from the eye reached an illuminated object and were reflected back. As with his theories on Astrology, the dichotomy of contact and distance is present in al-Kindi&#x27;s writings on this subject as well.

The factor which al-Kindi relied upon to determine which of these theories was most correct was how adequately each one explained the experience of seeing. For example, Aristotle&#x27;s theory was unable to account for why the angle at which an individual sees an object affects his perception of it. For example, why a circle viewed from the side will appear as a line. According to Aristotle, the &quot;complete&quot; sensible form of a circle should be transmitted to the eye and it should appear as a circle. On the other hand, Euclidean optics provided a geometric model that was able to account for this, as well as the length of shadows and reflections in mirrors, because Euclid believed that the visual &quot;rays&quot; could only travel in straight lines. For this reason, al-Kindi considered the latter preponderant.

Al-Kindi&#x27;s primary optical treatise &quot;De aspectibus&quot; was later translated into Latin. This work, along with Alhazen&#x27;s Optics and the Arabic translations of Ptolemy and Euclid&#x27;s Optics, were the main Arabic texts to affect the development of optical investigations in Europe, most notably those of Robert Grosseteste, Vitello and Roger Bacon.

===Medicine===
There are more than thirty treatises attributed to al-Kindi in the field of medicine, in which he was chiefly influenced by the ideas of Galen. His most important work in this field is probably &quot;De Gradibus&quot;, in which he demonstrates the application of mathematics to medicine, particularly in the field of pharmacology. For example, he developed a mathematical scale to quantify the strength of a drug, and a system (based on the phases of the moon) that would allow a doctor to determine in advance the most critical days of a patient&#x27;s illness. According to Plinio Prioreschi, this was the first attempt at serious quantification in medicine.

===Chemistry===
Al-Kindi denied the possibility of transmuting base metals into precious metals such as gold and silver, a position that was later attacked by the Persian alchemist and physician Abu Bakr al-Razi ().

One work attributed to al-Kindi, variously known as the &quot;Kitāb al-Taraffuq fī l-ʿiṭr&quot; (&quot;The Book of Gentleness on Perfume&quot;) or the &quot;Kitāb Kīmiyāʾ al-ʿiṭr wa-l-taṣʿīdāt&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations&quot;), contains one of the earliest known references to the distillation of wine. The work also describes the distillation process for extracting rose oils, and provides recipes for 107 different kinds of perfumes.

===Mathematics===
Al-Kindi authored works on a number of important mathematical subjects, including arithmetic, geometry, the Hindu numbers, the harmony of numbers, lines and multiplication with numbers, relative quantities, measuring proportion and time, and numerical procedures and cancellation. He also wrote four volumes, &quot;On the Use of the Hindu Numerals&quot; ( &quot;Kitāb fī Isti`māl al-&#x27;A`dād al-Hindīyyah&quot;) which contributed greatly to diffusion of the Hindu system of numeration in the Middle-East and the West. In geometry, among other works, he wrote on the theory of parallels. Also related to geometry were two works on optics. One of the ways in which he made use of mathematics as a philosopher was to attempt to disprove the eternity of the world by demonstrating that actual infinity is a mathematical and logical absurdity.

Al-Kindi is credited with developing a method whereby variations in the frequency of the occurrence of letters could be analyzed and exploited to break ciphers (i.e. cryptanalysis by frequency analysis). His book on this topic is &quot;Risāla fī Istikhrāj al-Kutub al-Mu&#x27;ammāh&quot; (رسالة في استخراج الكتب المعماة; literally: &quot;On Extracting Obscured Correspondence&quot;, more contemporarily: &quot;On Decrypting Encrypted Correspondence&quot;). In his treatise on cryptanalysis, he wrote:One way to solve an encrypted message, if we know its language, is to find a different plaintext of the same language long enough to fill one sheet or so, and then we count the occurrences of each letter. We call the most frequently occurring letter the &quot;first&quot;, the next most occurring letter the &quot;second&quot;, the following most occurring letter the &quot;third&quot;, and so on, until we account for all the different letters in the plaintext sample. Then we look at the cipher text we want to solve and we also classify its symbols. We find the most occurring symbol and change it to the form of the &quot;first&quot; letter of the plaintext sample, the next most common symbol is changed to the form of the &quot;second&quot; letter, and the following most common symbol is changed to the form of the &quot;third&quot; letter, and so on, until we account for all symbols of the cryptogram we want to solve.

Al-Kindi was influenced by the work of al-Khalil (717–786), who wrote the &quot;Book of Cryptographic Messages&quot;, which contains the first use of to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels.

===Meteorology===
In a treatise entitled as &quot;Risala fi l-Illa al-Failali l-Madd wa l-Fazr&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Efficient Cause of the Flow and Ebb&quot;), al-Kindi presents a theory on tides which &quot;depends on the changes which take place in bodies owing to the rise and fall of temperature.&quot; In order to support his argument, he gave a description of a scientific experiment as follows:

One can also observe by the senses... how in consequence of extreme cold air changes into water. To do this, one takes a glass bottle, fills it completely with snow, and closes its end carefully. Then one determines its weight by weighing. One places it in a container... which has previously been weighed. On the surface of the bottle the air changes into water, and appears upon it like the drops on large porous pitchers, so that a considerable amount of water gradually collects inside the container. One then weighs the bottle, the water and the container, and finds their weight greater than previously, which proves the change. [...] Some foolish persons are of opinion that the snow exudes through the glass. This is impossible. There is no process by which water or snow can be made to pass through glass.

In explaining the natural cause of the wind, and the difference for its directions based on time and location, he wrote:
When the sun is in its northern declination northerly places will heat up and it will be cold towards the south. Then the northern air will expand in a southerly direction because of the heat due to the contraction of the southern air. Therefore most of the summer winds are merits and most of the winter winds are not.

===Music theory===
Al-Kindi was the first theoretician of music in the Arab-Islamic world whose works have come down to us. He transferred the Greek tonal system to the Arabic lute. Although he used tone letters (i.e. the Arabic alphabet), he also transferred the Greek tonal names to Arabic. He added a fifth string to the &#x27;ud. He is known to have written treatises on music theory.
The known indexes list a varying number of writings attributed to him, but only four have survived and can be attributed to him with certainty:
*&quot;Stringed Instruments from One String to Ten Strings&quot;.
*&quot;Epistle on Informative Parts on Music&quot;.
*&quot;Epistle on Modes and Tones&quot;.
*&quot;Epistle on the Knowledge of the Composition of Melodies&quot;.

His works include discussions on the therapeutic value of music and what he regarded as &quot;cosmological connections&quot; of music.

==Philosophical thought==

===Influences===
While Muslim intellectuals were already acquainted with Greek philosophy (especially logic), al-Kindi is credited with being the first real Muslim &quot;philosopher&quot;. His own thought was largely influenced by the Neo-Platonic philosophy of Proclus, Plotinus and John Philoponus, amongst others, although he does appear to have borrowed ideas from other Hellenistic schools as well. He makes many references to Aristotle in his writings, but these are often unwittingly re-interpreted in a Neo-Platonic framework. This trend is most obvious in areas such as metaphysics and the nature of God as a causal entity. Experts have suggested that he was influenced by the Mutazilite school of theology, because of the mutual concern both he and they demonstrated for maintaining the singularity (tawhid) of God. A minority view however holds that such agreements are considered incidental.

===Metaphysics===
According to al-Kindi, the goal of metaphysics is knowledge of God. For this reason, he does not make a clear distinction between philosophy and theology, because he believes they are both concerned with the same subject. Later philosophers, particularly al-Farabi and Avicenna, would strongly disagree with him on this issue, by saying that metaphysics is actually concerned with being qua being, and as such, the nature of God is purely incidental.

Central to al-Kindi&#x27;s understanding of metaphysics is God&#x27;s absolute oneness, which he considers an attribute uniquely associated with God (and therefore not shared with anything else). By this he means that while we may think of any existent thing as being &quot;one&quot;, it is in fact both &quot;one&quot; and many&quot;. For example, he says that while a body is one, it is also composed of many different parts. A person might say &quot;I see an elephant&quot;, by which he means &quot;I see &quot;one&quot; elephant&quot;, but the term &#x27;elephant&#x27; refers to a species of animal that contains many. Therefore, only God is absolutely one, both in being and in concept, lacking any multiplicity whatsoever. Some feel this understanding entails a very rigorous negative theology because it implies that any description which can be predicated to anything else, cannot be said about God.

In addition to absolute oneness, al-Kindi also described God as the Creator. This means that He acts as both a final and efficient cause. Unlike later Muslim Neo-Platonic philosophers (who asserted that the universe existed as a result of God&#x27;s existence &quot;overflowing&quot;, which is a passive act), al-Kindi conceived of God as an active agent. In fact, of God as &quot;the&quot; agent, because all other intermediary agencies are contingent upon Him. The key idea here is that God &quot;acts&quot; through created intermediaries, which in turn &quot;act&quot; on one another – through a chain of cause and effect – to produce the desired result. In reality, these intermediary agents do not &quot;act&quot; at all, they are merely a conduit for God&#x27;s own action. This is especially significant in the development of Islamic philosophy, as it portrayed the &quot;first cause&quot; and &quot;unmoved mover&quot; of Aristotelian philosophy as compatible with the concept of God according to Islamic revelation.

===Epistemology===
Al-Kindi theorized that there was a separate, incorporeal and universal intellect (known as the &quot;First Intellect&quot;). It was the first of God&#x27;s creation and the intermediary through which all other things came into creation. Aside from its obvious metaphysical importance, it was also crucial to al-Kindi&#x27;s epistemology, which was influenced by Platonic realism.

According to Plato, everything that exists in the material world corresponds to certain universal forms in the heavenly realm. These forms are really abstract concepts such as a species, quality or relation, which apply to all physical objects and beings. For example, a red apple has the quality of &quot;redness&quot; derived from the appropriate universal. However, al-Kindi says that human intellects are only &quot;potentially&quot; able to comprehend these. This potential is actualized by the First Intellect, which is perpetually thinking about all of the universals. He argues that the external agency of this intellect is necessary by saying that human beings cannot arrive at a universal concept merely through perception. In other words, an intellect cannot understand the species of a thing simply by examining one or more of its instances. According to him, this will only yield an inferior &quot;sensible form&quot;, and not the universal form which we desire. The universal form can only be attained through contemplation and actualization by the First Intellect.

The analogy he provides to explain his theory is that of wood and fire. Wood, he argues, is potentially hot (just as a human is potentially thinking about a universal), and therefore requires something else which is already hot (such as fire) to actualize this. This means that for the human intellect to think about something, the First Intellect must already be thinking about it. Therefore, he says that the First Intellect must always be thinking about everything. Once the human intellect comprehends a universal by this process, it becomes part of the individual&#x27;s &quot;acquired intellect&quot; and can be thought about whenever he or she wishes.

===The soul and the afterlife===
Al-Kindi says that the soul is a simple, immaterial substance, which is related to the material world only because of its faculties which operate through the physical body. To explain the nature of our worldly existence, he (borrowing from Epictetus) compares it to a ship which has, during the course of its ocean voyage, temporarily anchored itself at an island and allowed its passengers to disembark. The implicit warning is that those passengers who linger too long on the island may be left behind when the ship sets sail again. Here, al-Kindi displays a stoic concept, that we must not become attached to material things (represented by the island), as they will invariably be taken away from us (when the ship sets sail again). He then connects this with a Neo-Platonist idea, by saying that our soul can be directed towards the pursuit of desire or the pursuit of intellect; the former will tie it to the body, so that when the body dies, it will also die, but the latter will free it from the body and allow it to survive &quot;in the light of the Creator&quot; in a realm of pure intelligence.

===The relationship between revelation and philosophy===
In the view of al-Kindi, prophecy and philosophy were two different routes to arrive at the truth. He contrasts the two positions in four ways. Firstly, while a person must undergo a long period of training and study to become a philosopher, prophecy is bestowed upon someone by God. Secondly, the philosopher must arrive at the truth by his own devices (and with great difficulty), whereas the prophet has the truth revealed to him by God. Thirdly, the understanding of the prophet – being divinely revealed – is clearer and more comprehensive than that of the philosopher. Fourthly, the way in which the prophet is able to express this understanding to the ordinary people is superior. Therefore, al-Kindi says the prophet is superior in two fields: the ease and certainty with which he receives the truth, and the way in which he presents it. However, the crucial implication is that the &quot;content&quot; of the prophet&#x27;s and the philosopher&#x27;s knowledge is the &quot;same&quot;. This, says Adamson, demonstrates how limited the superiority al-Kindi afforded to prophecy was.

In addition to this, al-Kindi adopted a naturalistic view of prophetic visions. He argued that, through the faculty of &quot;imagination&quot; as conceived of in Aristotelian philosophy, certain &quot;pure&quot; and well-prepared souls, were able to receive information about future events. Significantly, he does not attribute such visions or dreams to revelation from God, but instead explains that imagination enables human beings to receive the &quot;form&quot; of something without needing to perceive the physical entity to which it refers. Therefore, it would seem to imply that anyone who has purified themselves would be able to receive such visions. It is precisely this idea, amongst other naturalistic explanations of prophetic miracles that al-Ghazali attacks in his &quot;Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;.

===Critics and patrons===
While al-Kindi appreciated the usefulness of philosophy in answering questions of a religious nature, there would be many Islamic thinkers who were not as enthusiastic about its potential. But it would be incorrect to assume that they opposed philosophy simply because it was a &quot;foreign science&quot;. Oliver Leaman, an expert on Islamic philosophy, points out that the objections of notable theologians are rarely directed at philosophy itself, but rather at the conclusions the philosophers arrived at. Even al-Ghazali, who is famous for his critique of the philosophers, was himself an expert in philosophy and logic. And his criticism was that they arrived at theologically erroneous conclusions. The three most serious of these, in his view, were believing in the co-eternity of the universe with God, denying the bodily resurrection, and asserting that God only has knowledge of abstract universals, not of particular things (not all philosophers subscribed to these same views).

During his life, al-Kindi was fortunate enough to enjoy the patronage of the pro-Mutazilite Caliphs al-Ma&#x27;mun and al-Mu&#x27;tasim, which meant he could carry out his philosophical speculations with relative ease. In his own time, al-Kindi would be criticized for extolling the &quot;intellect&quot; as being the most immanent creation in proximity to God, which was commonly held to be the position of the angels. He also engaged in disputations with certain Mutazilites, whom he attacked for their belief in atoms, as not all Mutazilites accepted the belief of atomism. But the real role of al-Kindi in the conflict between philosophers and theologians would be to prepare the ground for debate. His works, says Deborah Black, contained all the seeds of future controversy that would be fully realized in al-Ghazali&#x27;s &quot;Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;.

==Legacy==
Al-Kindi was a master of many different areas of thought and was held to be one of the greatest philosophers. His influence in the fields of physics, mathematics, medicine, philosophy, and music were far-reaching and lasted for several centuries. Ibn al-Nadim in his praised al-Kindi and his work stating:
The best man of his time, unique in his knowledge of all the ancient sciences. He is called the Philosopher of the Arabs. His books deal with different sciences, such as logic, philosophy, geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, etc. We have connected him with the natural philosophers because of his prominence in Science.

Al-Kindi&#x27;s major contribution was his establishment of philosophy in the Islamic world and his efforts in trying to harmonize the philosophical investigation along with the Islamic theology and creed. The philosophical texts which were translated under his supervision would become the standard texts in the Islamic world for centuries to come, even after his influence has been eclipsed by later Philosophers.

Al-Kindi was also an important figure in medieval Europe. Several of his books got translated into Latin influencing Western authors like Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon. The Italian Renaissance scholar Geralomo Cardano (1501–1575) considered him one of the twelve greatest minds.

In 1986, the Royal Commission for Riyadh City inaugurated the Al Kindi Plaza in the Diplomatic Quarter district of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

<text>In Australia, bushland is a blanket term for land which supports remnant vegetation or land which is disturbed but still retains a predominance of the original floristics and structure. 

Human survival in bushland has a whole mythology evolving around it, with the stories of Aboriginal trackers and bushrangers deeply entrenched in Australian folklore. Bushland has been a traditional source of wood for fuel and bushfood.

Bushland provides a number of ecosystem services including the protection of water quality, stopping erosion, acting as a windbreak, and trapping nutrients. 
Bushland is prone to bushfires. This presents a challenge to authorities as infrastructure and habitations encroach into bushland areas.

==Preservation==
Until recently Australia had a very high rate of land clearing, which resulted in the destruction of bushland. Since 2006 the rate of land clearing has declined significantly. This is partially attributed to legislation that placed a ban on broad scale clearing of mature bushland in Queensland in 2006 and an expansion of those bans to regrowing bushland with a high conservation value in 2009. In New South Wales bushfires cause the greatest destruction of bushland, followed by land clearing for crops, grazing, road and buildings.
Bushland preservation has become the focus of some conservation efforts. In Brisbane, the Brisbane City Council has established a Bushland Acquisition Program, which is funded by a small levy paid by rate-payers. The program began in 1990 and aims to protect koala habitat from urban development. It is estimated that the koala population in the area had declined from 6,240 in 1996 to 1,500 in 2012.

<text>Tetrazine is a compound that consists of a six-membered aromatic ring containing four nitrogen atoms with the molecular formula C2H2N4. The name &quot;tetrazine&quot; is used in the nomenclature of derivatives of this compound. Three core-ring isomers exist: 1,2,3,4-tetrazines, 1,2,3,5-tetrazines, and 1,2,4,5-tetrazines, also known as v-tetrazines, as-tetrazines and s-tetrazines respectively.

==1,2,3,4-Tetrazines==
1,2,3,4-Tetrazines are often isolated fused to an aromatic ring system and are stabilized as the dioxide derivatives.

==1,2,4,5-Tetrazine==
1,2,4,5-Tetrazines are very well known and myriad 3,6-disubstituted 1,2,4,5-tetrazines are known. These materials are of use in the area of energetic chemistry. 

Heavily substituted tetrazines form the verdazyls, a family of stable radicals. 

Protected tetrazines are strong acetylene acceptors in Diels-Alder equilibria. For example, dipyridinyl 1,2,4,5-tetrazine abstracts acetylene from norbornadiene to cyclopentadiene and a pyridazine:
With norbornadiene fused to an arene the reaction stops at an intermediary stage.

<text>Sisinnius I of Constantinople (, &quot;&quot;; died 24 December 427) was the Archbishop of Constantinople from 426 to 427.

Before the election, Sisinnius was priest in the area of Elaea (modern-day Cihangir) and had become known for his virtues and piety, as well as for acts of charity.

After the death of archbishop Atticus of Constantinople, the patriarch&#x27;s throne was vacant for some time, as there was controversy about the choice of a successor. According to the dominant view, this period was about four months and ended with the election of Sisinnius on 28 February 426.

For the consecration and its establishment, the Eastern Roman emperor Theodosius II convened a meeting chaired by the patriarch of Antioch, Theodotus of Antioch.

In the days of the patriarch was in recession the question of the attitude of the followers of John Chrysostom, which occurred when he was exiled.

<doc id="272074" wikidata="Q491558" url="?curid=272074" title="Ibn Taymiyya">
<text>Ibn Taymiyya (; 22 January 1263 – 26 September 1328) was a Sunni Muslim scholar, jurist, traditionist, ascetic, proto-Salafi theologian and iconoclast. He is known for his diplomatic involvement with the Ilkhanid ruler Ghazan Khan at the Battle of Marj al-Saffar, which ended the Mongol invasions of the Levant. A legal jurist of the Hanbali school, Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s condemnation of numerous Sufi practices associated with saint veneration and visitation of tombs made him a controversial figure with many rulers and scholars of the time, which caused him to be imprisoned several times as a result.

A polarizing figure in his own times and the centuries that followed, Ibn Taymiyya has emerged as one of the most influential medieval scholars in late modern Sunni Islam. He is also noteworthy for engaging in fierce religious polemics that attacked various schools of speculative theology, primarily Ash&#x27;arism and Maturidism, while defending the doctrines of Atharism. This prompted rival clerics and state authorities to accuse Ibn Taymiyya and his disciples of anthropomorphism, which eventually led to the censoring of his works and subsequent incarceration.

Nevertheless, Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s numerous treatises that advocate for &quot;al-salafiyya al-iʿtiqādiyya&quot;, based on his scholarly interpretations of the Quran and prophetic way, constitute the most popular classical reference for later Salafi movements. It&#x27;s worth noting that, although the Salafi movement claims to follow Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s teachings four centuries later, their stance often diverges from his, tending to be somewhat more extreme. Throughout his treatises, Ibn Taymiyya asserted there is no contradiction between reason and revelation, and denounced the usage of philosophy as a pre-requisite in seeking religious truth. As a cleric who viewed Shiism as a source of corruption in Muslim societies, Ibn Taymiyya was also known for his anti-Shia polemics throughout treatises such as &quot;Minhaj al-Sunna&quot;, wherein he denounced the Imami Shia creed as heretical. He issued a ruling to wage jihad against the Shias of Kisrawan and personally fought in the Kisrawan campaigns himself, accusing Shias of acting as the fifth-columnists of the Frank Crusaders and Mongol Ilkhanids.

Within recent history, Ibn Taymiyya has been widely regarded as a major scholarly influence in militant Islamist movements, such as Salafi jihadism. Major aspects of his teachings, such as upholding the pristine monotheism of the early Muslim generations and campaigns to uproot what he regarded as polytheism, had a profound influence on Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the founder of the Wahhabism reform movement formed in the Arabian Peninsula, as well as other later Sunni scholars. Syrian Salafi theologian Muhammad Rashid Rida, one of the major modern proponents of Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s works, designated him as the &quot;Mujaddid&quot; of the 7th Islamic century. Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s doctrinal positions, such as his excommunication of the Mongol Ilkhanids and allowing jihad against other Muslims, were referenced by later Islamist political movements, including the Muslim Brotherhood, Hizb ut-Tahrir, al-Qaeda, and Islamic State, to justify social uprisings against the contemporary governments of the Muslim world.

Ibn Taymiyya paradoxically has an anti-Sufi reputation, although this is inaccurate. This false reputation is the result of the selective and out-of-context use of some of his writings by fundamentalist movements. While he sometimes held radical positions, Ibn Taymiyya criticized certain practices or ideas he considered deviations, yet he acknowledged that Sufism is an integral part of Islam and praised many Sufi masters. It was even claimed that he himself was affiliated with the Qadiriyya order.

==Biography==
=== Early years ===
==== Family ====
Ibn Taymiyya was born on 10 Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal 661 AH in Harran, Mamluk Sultanate to a family of traditional Hanbali scholars. He had Arab and Kurdish lineages by way of his Arab father and Kurdish mother. His father, Shihab al-Din Abd al-Halim ibn Taymiyya, held the Hanbali chair in Harran and later at the Umayyad Mosque. At the time, Harran was a part of the Mamluk Sultanate, near what is today the border of Syria and Turkey, currently in the Şanlıurfa Province. At the beginning of the Islamic period, Harran was located in Diyar Mudar, the land of the Mudar tribe. Before its destruction by the Mongols, Harran was also well-known since the early days of Islam for its tradition of adhering to the Hanbali school, to which Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s family belonged. His grandfather, Majd al-Din ibn Taymiyya, and his uncle, Fakhr al-Din, were both reputable scholars of the Hanbali school, and their scholarly achievements well-known.

====Education====
In 1269, Ibn Taymiyya, aged seven, left Harran together with his father and three brothers; however, the city was completely destroyed by the ensuing Mongol invasion. Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s family moved and settled in Damascus, Syria, which was ruled by the Mamluk Sultanate at the time.

In Damascus, his father served as the director of the Sukkariyya Madrasa, a place where Ibn Taymiyya also received his early education. He acquainted himself with the religious and secular sciences of his time. His religious studies began in his early teens when he committed the entire Quran to memory, and later came to learn the disciplines of the Quran. From his father, he learnt the religious science of jurisprudence and its principles. Ibn Taymiyya studied the works of Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Abu Bakr al-Khallal, and Ibn Qudama, as well as the works of his own grandfather, Majd al-Din. His study of jurisprudence was not limited to the Hanbali tradition, as he also studied the other schools of jurisprudence.

The number of scholars under which he studied hadith is said to number more than two-hundred, four of whom were women. Those who are known by name amount to forty hadith teachers, as recorded by Ibn Taymiyya in his work titled &quot;Arba&#x27;un Haditha&quot;. Serajul Haque says, based on this, Ibn Taymiyya started to hear hadith from the age of five. One of Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s teachers was the first Hanbali Chief Justice of Syria, Shams al-Din al-Maqdisi, who held the newly created position instituted by Baibars as part of a reform of the judiciary. Al-Maqdisi later came to give Ibn Taymiyya permission to issue legal verdicts, making him a judge at the age of seventeen.

Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s secular studies led him to devote attention to the Arabic language and literature by studying Arabic grammar and lexicography under Ali ibn Abd al-Qawi al-Tufi. He went on to master the famous book of Arabic grammar &quot;al-Kitab&quot;, written by the grammarian Sibawayhi. He also studied mathematics, algebra, calligraphy, speculative theology, philosophy, history, and heresiography. With the knowledge he gained from history and philosophy, he set to refute the prevalent philosophical discourses of his time, one of which was Aristotelianism. Ibn Taymiyya also learnt about Sufism and stated he had reflected on the works of Sahl al-Tustari, al-Junayd al-Baghdadi, Abu Talib al-Makki, Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani, Shihab al-Din Umar al-Suhrawardi, and Ibn Arabi. In 1282, Ibn Taymiyya completed his education at the age of 20.

===Life as a scholar===

After his father died in 1284, he took up the then vacant post as the head of the Sukkariyya madrasa and began giving lessons on Hadith. A year later he started giving lessons, as chair of the Hanbali Zawiya on Fridays at the Umayyad Mosque, on the subject of tafsir (exegesis of Qur&#x27;an). In November 1292, Ibn Taymiyya performed the Hajj and after returning 4 months later, he wrote his first book aged twenty nine called &quot;Manasik al-Hajj&quot; (Rites of the Pilgrimage), in which he criticized and condemned the religious innovations he saw take place there. Ibn Taymiyya represented the Hanbali school of thought during this time. The Hanbali school was seen as the most traditional school out of the four legal systems (Hanafi, Maliki and Shafi&#x27;i) because it was &quot;suspicious of the Hellenist disciplines of philosophy and speculative theology.&quot; He remained faithful throughout his life to this school, whose doctrines he had mastered, but he nevertheless called for &quot;ijtihad&quot; (independent reasoning by one who is qualified) and discouraged &quot;taqlid&quot;.

Ibn Taymiyya had a simple life, most of which he dedicated to learning, writing, and teaching. He never married nor did he have a female companion throughout his years. Professor Al-Matroudi stated that this may be why he was able to engage fully with the political affairs of his time without holding any official position such as that of a &quot;qadi&quot;. An offer of an official position was made to him but he never accepted.

====Possible influences====
Ibn Taymiyya was taught by scholars who were renowned in their time; however, there is no evidence any of them had a significant influence on him.

A strong influence on Ibn Taymiyya was the founder of the Hanbali school itself, Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Ibn Taymiyya was trained in his school by studying Ahmad&#x27;s &quot;Musnad&quot; in great detail, having studied it multiple times. Though he spent much of his life following this school, he renounced blind-following near the end of his life.

His work was most influenced by the sayings and actions of the first three generations of Muslims (&quot;salaf&quot;), which is displayed in his works where he would give preference to their opinions over those of his contemporaries. The modern Salafi movement derives its name from these generations.

==== Relationship with the authorities ====
Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s own relationship, as a religious scholar, with the ruling apparatus was not always amicable. It ranged from silence to open rebellion. On occasions when he shared the same views and aims as the ruling authorities his contributions were welcomed, but when Ibn Taymiyya went against the status quo, he was seen as &quot;uncooperative&quot;, and on occasions spent much time in prison. Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s attitude towards his own rulers was based on the actions of Muhammad&#x27;s companions when they made an oath of allegiance to him as follows; &quot;to obey within obedience to God, even if the one giving the order is unjust; to abstain from disputing the authority of those who exert it; and to speak out the truth, or take up its cause without fear in respect of God, of blame from anyone.&quot;

Ibn Taymiyya was a religious scholar as well as an Islamic political activist. In his efforts he was persecuted and imprisoned on six occasions with the total time spent inside prison coming to over six years. Other sources say that he spent over twelve years in prison. His detentions were due to the pushback from the clerical establishment of the Mamluk Sultanate, who opposed certain elements of his creed and his views on some jurisprudential issues. However, according to Yahya Michot, &quot;the real reasons were more trivial&quot;. Michot stated five reasons as to why Ibn Taymiyya was imprisoned by the Mamluk government, they being: not complying with the &quot;doctrines and practices prevalent among powerful religious and Sufi establishments, an overly outspoken personality, the jealousy of his peers, the risk to public order due to this popular appeal and political intrigues.&quot; Baber Johansen stated that the reasons for Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s incarcerations were, &quot;as a result of his conflicts with Muslim mystics, jurists, and theologians, who were able to persuade the political authorities of the necessity to limit Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s range of action through political censorship and incarceration.&quot;

Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s emergence in the public and political spheres began in 1293 when he was 30 years old, when the authorities asked him to issue a fatwa (legal verdict) on Assaf al-Nasrani, a Christian cleric who was accused of insulting Muhammad. He accepted the invitation and delivered his fatwa, calling for the man to receive the death penalty. Despite the fact that public opinion was very much on Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s side, the Governor of Syria attempted to resolve the situation by asking Assaf to accept Islam in return for his life, to which he agreed. This resolution was not acceptable to Ibn Taymiyya who then, together with his followers, protested against it outside the governor&#x27;s palace, demanding that Assaf be put to death, on the grounds that any person—Muslim or non-Muslim—who insults Muhammad must be killed. His unwillingness to compromise, coupled with his attempt to protest against the governor&#x27;s actions, resulted in him being punished with a prison sentence, the first of many such imprisonments which were to come. The French orientalist Henri Laoust says that during his incarceration, Ibn Taymiyya &quot;wrote his first great work, &quot;al-Ṣārim al-maslūl ʿalā shātim al-Rasūl (The Drawn Sword against those who insult the Messenger).&quot;&quot; Ibn Taymiyya, together with the help of his disciples, continued with his efforts against what, &quot;he perceived to be un-Islamic practices&quot; and to implement what he saw as his religious duty of commanding good and forbidding wrong. Yahya Michot says that some of these incidences included: &quot;shaving children&#x27;s heads&quot;, leading &quot;an anti-debauchery campaign in brothels and taverns&quot;, hitting an atheist before his public execution, destroying what was thought to be a sacred rock in a mosque, attacking astrologers and obliging &quot;deviant Sufi Shaykhs to make public acts of contrition and adhere to the Sunnah.&quot; Ibn Taymiyya and his disciples used to condemn wine sellers and they would attack wine shops in Damascus by breaking wine bottles and pouring them onto the floor.

A few years later in 1296, he took over the position of one of his teachers (Zayn al-Din Ibn al-Munadjdjaal), taking the post of professor of Hanbali jurisprudence at the Hanbaliyya madrasa, the oldest such institution of this tradition in Damascus. This is seen by some to be the peak of his scholarly career. The year when he began his post at the Hanbaliyya madrasa, was a time of political turmoil. The Mamluk sultan Al-Adil Kitbugha was deposed by his vice-sultan Al-Malik al-Mansur Lajin who then ruled from 1297 to 1299. Lajin desired to commission an expedition against the Christians of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia who formed an alliance with the Mongol Empire and participated in the military campaign which lead to the destruction of Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, and the destruction of Harran, the birthplace of Ibn Taymiyya, for that purpose, he urged Ibn Taymiyya to call the Muslims to Jihad.

In 1298, Ibn Taymiyya wrote his explanation for the ayat al-mutashabihat (the unclear verses of the Qur&#x27;an) titled Al-`Aqidat al-Hamawiyat al-Kubra (The creed of the great people of Hama). The book is about divine attributes and it served as an answer to a question from the city of Hama, Syria. At that particular time Ash&#x27;arites held prominent positions within the Islamic scholarly community in both Syria and Egypt, and they held a certain position on the divine attributes of God. Ibn Taymiyya in his book strongly disagreed with their views and this heavy opposition to the common Ash&#x27;ari position, caused considerable controversy.

Once more, Ibn Taymiyya collaborated with the Mamluks in 1300, when he joined the punitive expedition against the Alawites and Shiites, in the Kasrawan region of the Lebanese mountains. Ibn Taymiyya believed that the Alawites were &quot;more heretical than Jews and Christians&quot;, and according to Carole Hillenbrand, the confrontation with the Alawites occurred because they &quot;were accused of collaborating with Christians and Mongols.&quot; Ibn Taymiyya had further active involvements in campaigns against the Mongols and their alleged Alawite allies.

In 1305, Ibn Taymiyya took part in a second military offensive against the Alawites and the Isma`ilis in the Kasrawan region of the Lebanese mountains where they were defeated. The majority of the Alawis and Ismailis eventually converted to Twelver Shiism and settled in south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley, with a few Shia pockets that survived in the Lebanese mountains.

=== Involvement in the Mongol invasions ===
==== First invasion ====
The first invasion took place between December 1299 and April 1300 due to the military campaign by the Mamluks against the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia who were allied with the Mongols. Due to the Mongol legal system that neglected &quot;sharia&quot; and implemented Yassa; Ibn Taymiyya had declared &quot;Takfir&quot; upon the Ilkhanid regime and its armies for ruling by man-made laws, despite these laws being rarely enforced in Muslim majority regions in an extensive manner. Openly rejecting Ghazan Khan&#x27;s claim to &quot;pādishāh al-islām&quot; (King of Islam), a title which Ghazan took to legitimise his military campaigns, Ibn Taymiyya denounced him as an &quot;infidel king&quot; and issued numerous &quot;fatwas&quot; condemning the political order of the Tatars. The Ilkhanate army managed to defeat the Mamluk Sultanate in The Third Battle of Homs and reach Damascus by the end of December 1299. Fearful of Mongol atrocities, many scholars, intellectuals and officers began to flee Damascus in panic. Ibn Taymiyya was one of those clerics who stood firm alongside the vulnerable Damascus citizens and called for an uncompromising and heroic resistance to the Tatar invaders. Ibn Taymiyya drew parallels of their crisis with the Riddah wars (Apostate wars) fought by the first Muslim Caliph, Abu Bakr, against the renegade Arabian tribes that abandoned &quot;sharia&quot;. Ibn Taymiyya severely rebuked those Muslims escaping in the face of Mongol onslaught and compared their state to the withdrawal of Muslims in the Battle of Uhud. In a passionate letter to the commander of the Damascene Citadel, Ibn Taymiyya appealed: &quot;Until there stands even a single rock, do everything in your power to not surrender the castle. There is great benefit for the people of Syria. Allah declared it a sanctuary for the people of Shām—where it will remain a land of faith and &quot;sunna&quot; until the descent of the Prophet Jesus.&quot;Despite political pressure, Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s directives were heeded by the Mamluk officer and Mongol negotiations to surrender the Citadel stalled. Shortly after, Ibn Taymiyya and a number of his acolytes and pupils took part in a counter-offensive targeting various Shia tribes allied to the Mongols in the peripheral regions of the city; thereby repelling the Mongol attack. Ibn Taymiyya went with a delegation of Islamic scholars to talk to Ghazan Khan, who was the Khan of the Mongol Ilkhanate of Iran, to plead clemency. By early January 1300, the Mongol allies, the Armenians and Georgians, had caused widespread damage to Damascus and they had taken Syrian prisoners. The Mongols effectively occupied Damascus for the first four months of 1303. Most of the military had fled the city, including most of the civilians. Ibn Taymiyya however, stayed and was one of the leaders of the resistance inside Damascus and he went to speak directly to the Ilkhan, Mahmud Ghazan, and his vizier Rashid al-Din Tabib. He sought the release of Muslim and dhimmi prisoners which the Mongols had taken in Syria, and after negotiation, secured their release.

==== Second invasion ====
The second invasion lasted between October 1300 and January 1301. Ibn Taymiyya at this time began giving sermons on jihad at the Umayyad mosque. As the civilians began to flee in panic; Ibn Taymiyya pronounced &quot;fatwas&quot; declaring the religious duty upon Muslims to fight the Mongol armies to death, inflict a massive defeat and expel them from Syria in its entirety. Ibn Taymiyya also spoke to and encouraged the Governor of Damascus, al-Afram, to achieve victory over the Mongols. He became involved with al-Afram once more, when he was sent to get reinforcements from Cairo. Narrating Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s fierce stance on fighting the Mongols, Ibn Kathir reports:

==== Third invasion and &quot;Takfir&quot; of Ilkhanate Allies ====
The year 1303 saw the third Mongol invasion of Syria by Ghazan Khan. What has been called Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s &quot;most famous&quot; &quot;fatwā&quot; was his third &quot;fatwa&quot; issued against the Mongols in the Mamluk&#x27;s war. Ibn Taymiyya declared that jihad against the Mongol attack on the Malmuk sultanate was not only permissible, but obligatory. The reason being that the Mongols could not, in his opinion, be true Muslims despite the fact that they had converted to Sunni Islam because they ruled using what he considered &#x27;man-made laws&#x27; (their traditional Yassa code) rather than Islamic law or &quot;Sharia&quot;, whilst believing that the Yassa code was better than the Sharia law. Because of this, he reasoned they were living in a state of jahiliyyah, or pre-Islamic pagan ignorance. Not only were Ilkhanate political elites and its military disbelievers in the eyes of Ibn Taymiyya; but anybody who joined their ranks were as guilty of &quot;riddah&quot; (apostasy) as them:

The &quot;fatwa&quot; broke new Islamic legal ground because &quot;no jurist had ever before issued a general authorization for the use of lethal force against Muslims in battle&quot;, and would later influence modern-day Jihadists in their use of violence against other Muslims whom they deemed as apostates. In his legal verdicts issued to inform the populace, Ibn Taymiyya classified the Tatars and their advocates into four types:

* &quot;Kaafir Asli&quot; (i.e., those original non-Muslims fighting in Tatar armies and who never embraced Islam)
* Muslims of other ethnicities who became apostates due to their alliance with Mongols
* Irreligious Muslims aligned with Ilkhanids whom Ibn Taymiyya analogized with renegade Arabian tribes of the Riddah wars
* Personally pious Muslims affiliated with the Mongol armies. Ibn Taymiyya harshly rebuked these people as the &quot;most evil&quot; faction; and argued that their piety was useless because of their decision to ally with non-Muslims who ruled by man-made laws. This rationale was also expanded to excommunicate those &quot;court scholars&quot; who vindicated the Tatar authorities

Ibn Taymiyya called on the Muslims to jihad once again and personally participated in the Battle of Marj al-Saffar against the Ilkhanid army; leading his disciples in the field with a sword. The battle began on April 20 of that year. On the same day, Ibn Taymiyya declared a &quot;fatwa&quot; which exempted Mamluk soldiers from fasting during Ramadan so that they could preserve their strength. Within two days the Mongols were severely crushed and the battle was won; thus ending Mongol control of Syria. These incidents greatly increased the scholarly prestige and social stature of Ibn Taymiyya amongst the masses, despite opposition from the establishment clergy. He would soon be appointed as the chief professor of the elite scholarly institute &quot;&quot;Kāmiliyya Dār al-Haḍīth&quot;.&quot;

==== Contemporary Impact ====
Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s three unprecedented &quot;fatwas&quot; (legal verdicts) that excommunicated the Ilkhanid authorities and their supporters as apostates over their neglect to govern by &quot;Sharia&quot; (Islamic law) and preference of the traditional Mongol imperial code of Yassa; would form the theological basis of 20th century Islamist and Jihadist scholars and ideologues. Reviving Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s fatwas during the late 20th-century, Jihadist ideologues like Sayyid Qutb, Abd al-Salam al-Faraj, Abdullah Azzam, Usama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, etc. made public &quot;Takfir&quot; (excommunication) of contemporary governments of the Muslim world and called for their revolutionary overthrowal through armed Jihad.

=== Imprisonment on charges of anthropomorphism ===
Ibn Taymiyya was a fervent polemicist who zealously launched theological refutations against various religious sects such as the Sufis, Jahmites, Ash&#x27;arites, Shias, &quot;Falsafa&quot;, etc., labelling them as heretics responsible for the crisis of Mongol invasions across the Islamic World. He was imprisoned several times for conflicting with the prevailing opinions of the jurists and theologians of his day. A judge from the city of Wasit, Iraq, requested that Ibn Taymiyya write a book on creed. His subsequent creedal work, &quot;Al-Aqidah Al-Waasitiyyah&quot;, caused him trouble with the authorities. Ibn Taymiyya adopted the view that God should be described as he was literally described in the Qur&#x27;an and in the hadith, and that all Muslims were required to believe this because according to him it was the view held by the early Muslim community (&quot;salaf&quot;). Within the space of two years (1305–1306) four separate religious council hearings were held to assess the correctness of his creed.

The first hearing was held with Ash&#x27;ari scholars who accused Ibn Taymiyya of anthropomorphism. At the time Ibn Taymiyya was 42 years old. He was protected by the then Governor of Damascus, Aqqush al-Afram, during the proceedings. The scholars suggested that he accept that his creed was simply that of the Hanbalites and offered this as a way out of the charge. However, if Ibn Taymiyya ascribed his creed to the Hanbali school of law then it would be just one view out of the four schools which one could follow rather than a creed everybody must adhere to. Uncompromising, Ibn Taymiyya maintained that it was obligatory for all scholars to adhere to his creed.

Two separate councils were held a year later on January 22 and 28, 1306. The first council was in the house of the Governor of Damascus Aqqush al-Afram, who had protected him the year before when facing the Shafii scholars. A second hearing was held six days later where the Indian scholar Safi al-Din al-Hindi found him innocent of all charges and accepted that his creed was in line with the &quot;Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah&quot;. Regardless, in April 1306 the chief Islamic judges of the Mamluk state declared Ibn Taymiyya guilty and he was incarcerated. He was released four months later in September.

After his release in Damascus, the doubts regarding his creed seemed to have resolved but this was not the case. A Shafii scholar, Ibn al-Sarsari, was insistent on starting another hearing against Ibn Taymiyya which was held once again at the house of the Governor of Damascus, Al-Afram. His book &quot;Al-Aqidah Al-Waasitiyyah&quot; was still not found at fault. At the conclusion of this hearing, Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn al-Sarsari were sent to Cairo to settle the problem.

=== Life in Egypt ===

==== His debate on anthropomorphism and his imprisonment ====
On the arrival of Ibn Taymiyya and the Shafi&#x27;ite scholar in Cairo in 1306, an open meeting was held. The Mamluk sultan at the time was Al-Nasir Muhammad and his deputy attended the open meeting. Ibn Taymiyya was found innocent. Despite the open meeting, objections regarding his creed continued and he was summoned to the Citadel in Cairo for a &quot;munazara&quot; (legal debate), which took place on April 8, 1306. During the &quot;munazara&quot;, his views on divine attributes, specifically whether a direction could be attributed to God, were debated by the Indian scholar Safi al-Din al-Hindi, in the presence of Islamic judges. Ibn Taymiyya failed to convince the judges of his position and so was incarcerated for the charge of anthropomorphism on the recommendation of al-Hindi. Thereafter, he together with his two brothers were imprisoned in the Citadel of the Mountain (&quot;Qal&#x27;at al-Jabal&quot;), in Cairo until September 25, 1307. He was freed due to the help he received from two &quot;amirs&quot;; Salar and Muhanna ibn Isa, but he was not allowed to go back to Syria. He was then again summoned for a legal debate, but this time he convinced the judges that his views were correct and he was allowed to go free.

==== His trial for intercession and his imprisonment ====

Ibn Taymiyya continued to face troubles for his views which were found to be at odds with those of his contemporaries. His strong opposition to what he believed to be religious innovations, caused upset among the prominent Sufis of Egypt including Ibn Ata Allah and Karim al-Din al-Amuli, and the locals who started to protest against him. Their main contention was Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s stance on tawassul (intercession). In his view, a person could not ask anyone other than God for help except on the Day of Judgement when intercession in his view would be possible. At the time, the people did not restrict intercession to just the Day of Judgement but rather they said it was allowed in other cases. Due to this, Ibn Taymiyya, now aged 45, was ordered to appear before the Shafi&#x27;i judge Badr al-Din in March 1308 and was questioned on his stance regarding intercession. Thereafter, he was incarcerated in the prison of the judges in Cairo for some months. After his release, he was allowed to return to Syria, should he so wish. Ibn Taymiyya however stayed in Egypt for a further five years.

==== House arrest in Alexandria ====
1309, the year after his release, saw a new Mamluk sultan accede to the throne, Baibars al-Jashnakir. His reign, marked by economical and political unrest, only lasted a year. In August 1309, Ibn Taymiyya was taken into custody and placed under house arrest for seven months in the new sultan&#x27;s palace in Alexandria. He was freed when al-Nasir Muhammad retook the position of sultan on March 4, 1310. Having returned to Cairo a week later, he was received by al-Nasir. The sultan would sometimes consult Ibn Taymiyya on religious affairs and policies during the rest of his three-year stay in Cairo. During this time he continued to teach and wrote his famous book Al-&quot;Kitab al-Siyasa al-shar&#x27;iyya&quot; &quot;(Treatise on the Government of the Religious Law)&quot;, a book noted for its account of the role of religion in politics.

=== Return to Damascus and later years ===
He spent his last fifteen years in Damascus. Aged 50, Ibn Taymiyya returned to Damascus via Jerusalem on February 28, 1313. Damascus was now under the governorship of Tankiz. There, Ibn Taymiyya continued his teaching role as professor of Hanbali fiqh. This is when he taught his most famous student, Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya, who went on to become a noted scholar in Islamic history. Ibn Qayyim was to share in Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s renewed persecution.

Three years after his arrival in the city, Ibn Taymiyya became involved in efforts to deal with the increasing Shia influence amongst Sunni Muslims. An agreement had been made in 1316 between the &quot;amir&quot; of Mecca and the Ilkhanid ruler Öljaitü, brother of Ghazan Khan, to allow a favourable policy towards Shi&#x27;ism in the city. Around the same time the Shia theologian Al-Hilli, who had played a crucial role in the Mongol ruler&#x27;s decision to make Shi&#x27;ism the state religion of Persia, wrote the book &quot;Minhaj al-Karamah&quot;&quot; (&quot;The Way of Charisma&#x27;), which dealt with the Shia doctrine of the Imamate and also served as a refutation of the Sunni doctrine of the caliphate. In response, Ibn Taymiyya wrote his famous book, &quot;Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah&quot;, as a refutation of Al-Hilli&#x27;s work.

==== His fatwa on divorce and imprisonment ====
In 1318, Ibn Taymiyya wrote a treatise that would curtail the ease with which a Muslim man could divorce his wife. Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s fatwa on divorce was not accepted by the majority of scholars of the time and this continued into the Ottoman era. However, almost every modern Muslim nation-state has come to adopt Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s position on this issue of divorce. At the time he issued the fatwa, Ibn Taymiyya revived an edict by the sultan not to issue fatwas on this issue but he continued to do so, saying, &quot;I cannot conceal my knowledge&quot;. As in previous instances, he stated that his fatwa was based on the Qur&#x27;an and hadith. His view on the issue was at odds with the Hanbali position. This proved controversial among the people in Damascus as well as the Islamic scholars who opposed him on the issue.

According to the scholars of the time, an oath of divorce counted as a full divorce and they were also of the view that three oaths of divorce taken under one occasion counted as three separate divorces. The significance of this was, that a man who divorces the same partner three times is no longer allowed to remarry that person until and if that person marries and divorces another person. Only then could the man, who took the oath, remarry his previous wife. Ibn Taymiyya accepted this but rejected the validity of three oaths taken under one sitting to count as three separate divorces as long as the intention was not to divorce. Moreover, Ibn Taymiyya was of the view that a single oath of divorce uttered but not intended, also does not count as an actual divorce. He stated that since this is an oath much like an oath taken in the name of God, a person must expiate for an unintentional oath in a similar manner.

Due to his views and also by not abiding to the sultan&#x27;s letter two years before forbidding him from issuing a fatwa on the issue, three council hearings were held, in as many years (1318, 1319 and 1320), to deal with this matter. The hearing were overseen by the Viceroy of Syria, Tankiz. This resulted in Ibn Taymiyya being imprisoned on August 26, 1320, in the Citadel of Damascus. He was released about five months and 18 days later, on February 9, 1321, by order of the Sultan Al-Nasir. Ibn Taymiyya was reinstated as teacher of Hanbali law and he resumed teaching.

==== His risāla on visits to tombs and his final imprisonment ====
In 1310, Ibn Taymiyya had written a &quot;risāla&quot; (treatise) called &quot;Ziyārat al-Qubūr&quot; or according to another source, &quot;Shadd al-rihal&quot;. It dealt with the validity and permissibility of making a journey to visit the tombs of prophets and saints. It is reported that in the book &quot;he condemned the cult of saints&quot; and declared that traveling with the sole purpose of visiting Muhammad&#x27;s grave was a blameworthy religious innovation. For this, Ibn Taymiyya, was imprisoned in the Citadel of Damascus sixteen years later on July 18, 1326, aged 63, along with his student Ibn Qayyim. The sultan also prohibited him from issuing any further fatwas. Hanbali scholar Ahmad ibn Umar al-Maqdisi accused Ibn Taymiyya of apostasy over the treatise.

==== His life in prison ====

Ibn Taymiyya referred to his imprisonment as &quot;a divine blessing&quot;. During his incarceration, he wrote that, &quot;when a scholar forsakes what he knows of the Book of God and of the &quot;sunnah&quot; of His messenger and follows the ruling of a ruler which contravenes a ruling of God and his messenger, he is a renegade, an unbeliever who deserves to be punished in this world and in the hereafter.&quot;

During his imprisonment, he encountered opposition from the Maliki and Shafi&#x27;i Chief Justices of Damascus, Taḳī al-Dīn al-Ikhnāʾī. He remained in prison for over two years and ignored the sultan&#x27;s prohibition, by continuing to deliver fatwas. During his incarceration Ibn Taymiyya wrote three works which are extant; &quot;Kitāb Maʿārif al-wuṣūl, Rafʿ al-malām&quot;, and &quot;Kitāb al-Radd ʿala &#x27;l-Ikhnāʾī&quot; (The response to al-Ikhnāʾī). The last book was an attack on Taḳī al-Dīn al-Ikhnāʾī and explained his views on saints (wali).

When the Mongols invaded Syria in 1300, he was among those who called for a Jihad against them and he ruled that even though they had recently converted to Islam, they should be considered unbelievers. He went to Egypt in order to acquire support for his cause and while he was there, he got embroiled in religious-political disputes. Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s enemies accused him of advocating anthropomorphism, a view that was objectionable to the teachings of the Ash&#x27;ari school of Islamic theology, and in 1306, he was imprisoned for more than a year. Upon his release, he condemned popular Sufi practices and he also condemned the influence of Ibn Arabi (d. 1240), causing him to earn the enmity of leading Sufi shaykhs in Egypt and causing him to serve another prison sentence. In 1310, he was released by the Egyptian Sultan.

In 1313, the Sultan allowed Ibn Taymiyya to return to Damascus, where he worked as a teacher and a jurist. He had supporters among the powerful, but his outspokenness and his nonconformity to traditional Sunni doctrines and his denunciation of Sufi ideals and practices continued to draw the wrath of the religious and political authorities in Syria and Egypt. He was arrested and released several more times, but while he was in prison, he was allowed to write Fatwas (advisory opinions on matters of law) in defense of his beliefs. Despite the controversy that surrounded him, Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s influence grew and it spread from Hanbali circles to members of other Sunni legal schools and Sufi groups. Among his foremost students were Ibn Kathir (d. 1373), a leading medieval historian and a Quran commentator, and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziya (d. 1350), a prominent Hanbali jurist and a theologian who helped spread his teacher&#x27;s influence after his teacher&#x27;s death in 1328. Ibn Taymiyya died while he was a prisoner in the citadel of Damascus and he was buried in the city&#x27;s Sufi cemetery.

=== Death ===
He fell ill in early September 1328 and died at the age of 65, on September 26 of that year, whilst in prison at the Citadel of Damascus. Once this news reached the public, there was a strong show of support for him from the people. After the authorities had given permission, it is reported that thousands of people came to show their respects. They gathered in the Citadel and lined the streets up to the Umayyad Mosque. The funeral prayer was held in the citadel by scholar Muhammad Tammam, and a second was held in the mosque. A third and final funeral prayer was held by Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s brother, Zain al-Din. He was buried in Damascus, in &quot;Maqbara Sufiyya&quot; (&quot;the cemetery of the Sufis&quot;). His brother Sharafuddin had been buried in that cemetery before him.

Oliver Leaman says that being deprived of the means of writing led to Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s death. It is reported that two hundred thousand men and fifteen to sixteen thousand women attended his funeral prayer. Ibn Kathir says that in the history of Islam, only the funeral of Ahmad ibn Hanbal received a larger attendance. This is also mentioned by Ibn `Abd al-Hadi. Caterina Bori says that, &quot;In the Islamic tradition, wider popular attendance at funerals was a mark of public reverence, a demonstration of the deceased&#x27;s rectitude, and a sign of divine approbation.&quot;

Ibn Taymiyya is said to have &quot;spent a lifetime objecting to tomb veneration, only to cast a more powerful posthumous spell than any of his Sufi contemporaries.&quot; On his death, his personal effects were in such demand &quot;that bidders for his lice-killing camphor necklace pushed its price up to 150 dirhams, and his skullcap fetched a full 500.&quot; A few mourners sought and succeeded in &quot;drinking the water used for bathing his corpse.&quot; His tomb received &quot;pilgrims and sightseers&quot; for 600 years. His resting place is now &quot;in the parking lot of a maternity ward&quot;, though as of 2009 its headstone was broken, according to author Sadakat Kadri.

== Views ==
==Students==
Several of Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s students became notable scholars in their own right. His students came from different backgrounds and belonged to various different schools of thought. The most well-known of them are Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya and Ibn Kathir, while his other students include:

== Influence in his time ==
In the 21st century, Ibn Taymiyya is one of the most cited medieval authors and his treatises are regarded to be of central intellectual importance by several Islamic revivalist movements. Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s disciples, consisting of both Hanbalis and non-Hanbalis, were attracted to his advocacy of &quot;ijtihad&quot; outside the established boundaries of the &quot;madhabs&quot; and shared his taste for activism and religious reform. Some of his unorthodox legal views in the field of Fiqh were also regarded as a challenge by mainstream Fuqaha. Many scholars have argued that Ibn Taymiyya did not enjoy popularity among the intelligentsia of his day. Yossef Rapoport and Shahab Ahmed assert that he was a minority figure in his own times and the centuries that followed. Caterina Bori goes further, arguing that despite popularity Ibn Taymiyya may have enjoyed among the masses, he appears to have been not merely unpopular among the scholars of his day, but somewhat of an embarrassment. Khalid El-Rouayheb notes similarly that Ibn Taymiyya had &quot;very little influence on mainstream Sunni Islam until the nineteenth century&quot; and that he was &quot;a little-read scholar with problematic and controversial views.&quot; He also comments &quot;the idea that Ibn Taymiyya had an immediate and significant impact on the course of Sunni Islamic religious history simply does not cohere with the evidence that we have from the five centuries that elapsed between his death and the rise of Sunni revivalism in the modern period.&quot; It was only since the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries that the scholarly influence of Ibn Taymiyya has come to acquire an unprecedented prominence in Muslim societies, due to the efforts of Islamic revivalists like Rashid Rida. On the other hand, Prof. Al-Matroudi of SOAS university says that Ibn Taymiyya, &quot;was perhaps the most eminent and influential Hanbali jurist of the Middle Ages and one of the most prolific among them. He was also a renowned scholar of Islam whose influence was felt not only during his lifetime but extended through the centuries until the present day.&quot; Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s followers often deemed him as Sheikh ul-Islam, an honorific title with which he is sometimes still termed today.

In the pre-modern era, Ibn Taymiyya was considered a controversial figure within Sunni Islam and had a number of critics during his life and in the centuries thereafter. The Shafi&#x27;i scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami stated that,

He also stated that,

Taqi al-Din al-Hisni condemned Ibn Taymiyya in even stronger terms by referring to him as the &quot;heretic from Harran&quot; and similarly, Munawi considered Ibn Taymiyya to be an innovator though not an unbeliever. Taqi al-Din al-Subki criticised Ibn Taymiyya for &quot;contradicting the consensus of the Muslims by his anthropomorphism, by his claims that accidents exist in God, by suggesting that God was speaking in time, and by his belief in the eternity of the world.&quot; Ibn Battūta (d. 770/1369) famously wrote a work questioning Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s mental state. The possibility of psychological abnormalities not with-standing, Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s personality, by multiple accounts, was fiery and oftentimes unpredictable. The historian Al-Maqrizi said, regarding the rift between the Sunni Ash&#x27;ari&#x27;s and Ibn Taymiyya, &quot;People are divided into two factions over the question of Ibn Taymiyya; for until the present, the latter has retained admirers and disciples in Syria and Egypt.&quot; Both his supporters and rivals grew to respect Ibn Taymiyya because he was uncompromising in his views. Dhahabi&#x27;s views towards Ibn Taymiyya were ambivalent. His praise of Ibn Taymiyya is invariably qualified with criticism and misgivings and he considered him to be both a &quot;brilliant Shaykh&quot; and also &quot;cocky&quot; and &quot;impetuous&quot;. The Hanafi-Maturidi scholar &#x27;Ala&#x27; al-Din al-Bukhari said that anyone that gives Ibn Taymiyya the title Shaykh al-Islām is a disbeliever.

Despite the prevalent condemnations of Ibn Taymiyya outside Hanbali school during the pre-modern period, many prominent non-Hanbali scholars such as Ibrahim al-Kurrani (d.1690), Shāh Walī Allāh al-Dihlawi (d. 1762), Mehmet Birgiwi (d. 1573), Ibn al-Amīr Al-San&#x27;ani (d. 1768), Muḥammad al-Shawkānī (d. 1834), etc. would come to the defense of Ibn Taymiyya and advocate his ideas during this era. In the 18th century, influential South Asian Islamic scholar and revivalist Shah Waliullah Dehlawi would become the most prominent advocate of the doctrines of Ibn Taymiyya, and profoundly transformed the religious thought in South Asia. His seminary, &quot;Madrasah-i-Rahimya&quot;, became a hub of intellectual life in the country, and the ideas developed there quickly spread to wider academic circles. Making a powerful defense of Ibn Taymiyya and his doctrines, Shah Waliullah wrote:

The reputation and stature of Ibn Taymiyya amongst non-Ḥanbalī Sunni scholars would significantly improve between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. From a little-read scholar considered controversial by many, he would become one of the most popular scholarly figures in the Sunni religious tradition. The nineteenth-century Iraqi scholar Khayr al-Dīn al-Ālūsī (d. 1899) wrote an influential treatise titled &quot;Jalā’ al-‘aynayn fi muḥākamat al-Aḥmadayn&quot; in defense of Ibn Taymiyya. The treatise would make great impact on major scholars of the Salafiyya movement in Syria and Egypt, such as Jamāl al-Dīn al-Qāsimī (d. 1914) and Muḥammad Rashīd Riḍā (d. 1935). Praising Ibn Taymiyya as a central and heroic Islamic figure of the classical era, Rashid Rida wrote:

Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s works served as an inspiration for later Muslim scholars and historical figures, who have been regarded as his admirers or disciples. In the contemporary world, he may be considered at the root of Wahhabism, the Senussi order and other later reformist movements. Ibn Taymiyya has been noted to have influenced Rashid Rida, Abul A`la Maududi, Sayyid Qutb, Hassan al-Banna, Abdullah Azzam, and Osama bin Laden. The terrorist organization Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant used a fatwa of Ibn Taymiyya to justify the burning alive of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh. After the Iranian revolution, conservative Sunni &quot;ulema&quot; robustly championed Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s anti-Shia polemics across the Islamic World since the 1980s; and vast majority of Sunni intellectual circles adopted Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s rhetoric against Shi&#x27;ism.

== Influence in the modern period ==
=== Salafism ===
Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s appeals to the precedence of the &quot;Qur’an&quot; and the &quot;Sunna&quot; over the authority of the &quot;madh&#x27;hab&quot; system has inspired a wide range of Islamic reform movements over the last few centuries, and especially the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; reform movement that differ from other Sunnis who adhere to the four legal schools of &quot;Fiqh&quot; (jurisprudence). These include the 17th century Kadizadeli movement, 18th century Wahhabi movement as well as the Islamic reformist movement of Ibn al-Amīr Al-San’ani (d. 1768) and Muḥammad al-Shawkānī (d. 1834) in Yemen. In the nineteenth century, Taymiyyan tradition would expand across the Islamic World; influencing the &quot;Ahl-i Hadith&quot; movement in South Asia and the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement in Iraq, Syria and Egypt.

Ibn Taymiyya adamantly insisted that his theological doctrines constituted the original creed of the &quot;Salaf&quot;, as well as that of Abul Hasan al-Ash&#x27;ari; the eponym of the Ash&#x27;arite school. He also believed that &quot;Sharia&quot; (Islamic law) was best preserved through the teachings and practices of the &quot;Salaf&quot;, the earliest three generations of Muslims. Modern Islamic revivalist movements salute Ibn Taymiyya as &quot;the architect of Salafism&quot;, which symbolises the concept of reviving the traditions and values of the Golden Age of the prophet. For &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movements across the Islamic World, Ibn Taymiyya is their exemplar scholar who revived the methodology of the Salaf, and also a social reformer who defiantly stood against foreign occupation. Today, Salafi Muslims constitute the most avid readers and promoters of the works of Ibn Taymiyya.

=== Modern Islamism ===

Various concepts within modern Islamist movements can be attributed to Ibn Taymiyya. Ibn Taymiyya is highly revered in contemporary militant Islamist and Jihadist circles for his 1303 Fatwa of &quot;Takfir&quot; (excommunication) against Mongol Ilkhanate rulers (who were recent converts to Islam) and his assertion that it became obligatory for &quot;true Muslims&quot; to wage &quot;Jihad&quot; against the apostate Mongol leaders and Muslim citizens who accepted the Yassa code. Influenced by Ibn Taymiyya, Sayyid Qutb would take up Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s anti-Mongol &quot;fatwa&quot; and apply it on contemporary regimes across the Islamic World. Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s other major theological mission was to re-assert the primacy of armed jihad in Islamic faith, which played a major role in shaping future militant interpretations of Islam. Along with total, literal adherence to Sharia, he held that waging martial jihad was an Islamic religious obligation for all Muslims, when under foreign invasion. These ideas would be readily embraced in the 20th century by various militant Islamist movements and underpinned the theological justification for militancy of groups like Al-Qaeda, ISIS, etc. Scholars like Yahya Michot have noted that Ibn Taymiyya &quot;has thus become a sort of forefather of al-Qaeda.&quot;

One of main arguments put forth by Ibn Taymiyya was his categorising the world into distinct territories: the domain of Islam (dar al-Islam), where the rule is of Islam and sharia law is enforced; the domain of unbelief (dar-al-kufr) ruled by unbelievers; and the domain of war (dar al-harb) which is territory under the rule of unbelievers who are involved in an active or potential conflict with the domain of Islam. (Ibn Taymiyya included a fourth. When the Mongols, whom he considered unbelievers, took control of the city of Mardin the population included many Muslims. Believing Mardin was neither the domain of Islam, as Islam was not legally applied with an armed forces consisting of Muslims, nor the domain of war because the inhabitants were Muslim, Ibn Taymiyya created a new &quot;composite&quot; category, known as &quot;dar al-`ahd&quot;.) A second concept is making a declaration of apostasy (takfir) against a Muslim who does not obey Islam. But at the same time Ibn Taymiyya maintained that no one can question anothers faith and curse them as based on one&#x27;s own desire, because faith is defined by God and the prophet. He said, rather than cursing or condemning them, an approach should be taken where they are educated about the religion.

Another concept attributed to Ibn Taymiyya is, &quot;the duty to oppose and kill Muslim rulers who do not implement the revealed law (shari&#x27;a). Based on this doctrine, Ibn Taymiyya excommunicated the Ilkhanid state for not ruling by &quot;Sharia&quot; (Islamic law); despite officially professing Islam. Ibn Taymiyya issued various &quot;fatwas&quot; obliging all Muslims to fight the Mongols; declaring them as &quot;mushrikun&quot; (polytheists) similar to the people from the age of &quot;Jahiliyya&quot; (pre-Islamic ignorance). Thus, he is widely regarded as the &quot;spiritual forefather&quot; of the Salafi-Jihadist thought. 20th century Islamist ideologues like Muhammad Rashid Rida, Sayyid Qutb, Abd al Salam Faraj, Usama bin Laden, etc. drew upon these revolutionary ideas to justify armed Jihad against the contemporary nation-states. Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s fatwa on Alawites as &quot;more infidel than Christians and Jews&quot; has been recited by Muslim Brotherhood affiliated scholar Yusuf al-Qaradawi.

Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s role in the Islamist movements of the twentieth and twenty first century have also been noted by the previous Coordinator for Counterterrorism at the United States Department of State, Daniel Benjamin, who labels the chapter on the history of modern Islamic movements in his book &quot;The Age of Sacred Terror&quot;, as &quot;Ibn Taymiyya and His children&quot;. Yossef Rapoport, a reader in Islamic history at Queen Mary, however, says this is not a probable narrative. Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s intellectual tradition and ideas such as his emphasis on the revival of pristine ideals and practices of early generations also made an intense impact on the leading ideologue of revolutionary Islamism in South Asia, Sayyid Abul A&#x27;la Maududi (1903–1979 C.E/ 1321–1399 A.H).

=== Mardin fatwas and the Mardin Conference ===
One of Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s most famous fatwas are regarding the Mongols who had conquered and destroyed the Abbasid caliphate in 1258 and had then converted to Islam. Once they were in control the town of Mardin, they behaved unjustly with their subjects so the people of Mardin asked Ibn Taymiyya for a legal verdict regarding the classification of the territory under which they live. He categorized the territory as &quot;dar al-`ahd&quot; which in some ways is similar to dar al-kufr (domain of unbelievers). Included in his verdict was declaring the Mongol ruler Ghazan and other Mongols who did not accept shari&#x27;a in full, as unbelievers. He was also asked whether Muslims living in Mardin had to emigrate (&quot;Hijrah&quot;) to Islamic territories on account of implementation of man-made laws. Ibn Taymiyya responded in a detailed &quot;fatwa&quot;:

According to Nettler and Kéchichian, Ibn Taymiyya affirmed that Jihad against the Mongols, &quot;was not only permissible but obligatory because the latter ruled not according to Sharīʿah but through their traditional, and therefore manmade, Yassa code. This essentially meant that Mongols were living in a state of &quot;jāhilīyah &quot;(ignorance).&quot; The authors further state that his two famous students, Ibn Qayyim and Ibn Kathir, agreed with this ruling. He called for a defensive jihad to mobilize the people to kill the Mongol rulers and any one who supported them, Muslim or non-Muslim. Ibn Taymiyya when talking about those who support the Mongols said, &quot;Everyone who is with them (Mongols) in the state over which they rule has to be regarded as belonging to the most evil class of men. He is either an atheist (zindīq) or a hypocrite who does not believe in the essence of the religion of Islam. This means that he (only) outwardly pretends to be Muslim or he belongs to the worst class of all people who are the people of the bida` (heretical innovations).&quot; Yahya Mochet says that, Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s call to war was not simply to cause a &quot;rebellion against the political power in place&quot; but to repel an &quot;external enemy&quot;.

In another series of fatwas, Ibn Taymiyya reiterated the religious obligation of Muslims to fight the Ilkhanids on account of their negligence of Islamic laws. He also took issue with their non-religious approach to dealing with various communities such as Christians, Jews, Buddhists, etc. and employing a large chunk of their armies with non-Muslims. Citing these and various other reasons, Ibn Taymiyya pronounced:

In 2010, a group of Islamic Scholars at the Mardin conference argued that Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s famous fatwa about the residents of Mardin when it was under the control of the Mongols was misprinted into an order to &quot;fight&quot; the people living under their territory, whereas the actual statement is, &quot;The Muslims living therein should be treated according to their rights as Muslims, while the non-Muslims living there outside of the authority of Islamic Law should be treated according to their rights.&quot; They have based their understanding on the original manuscript in the Al-Zahiriyah Library, and the transmission by Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s student Ibn Muflih. The participants of the Mardin conference also rejected the categorization of the world into different domains of war and peace, stating that the division was a result of the circumstances at the time. The participants further stated that the division has become irrelevant with the existence of nation states.

=== His view on Sufism ===
Ibn Taymiyyah, often perceived as a critic of Sufism, had a more nuanced view than is commonly understood. While he critiqued certain practices he deemed innovations (bid&#x27;ah), he was an admirer of the spiritual path when it adhered to the foundational principles of Islam. A notable example of this is his admiration for Shaykh Abdul Qadir Jilani, a revered Sufi saint. Ibn Taymiyyah praised Shaykh Abdul Qadir Jilani for his adherence to the Sharia (Islamic law) and his deep spirituality, considering him a model of the correct practice of Sufism . Ibn Taymiyyah&#x27;s writings reflect a balanced approach to Sufism. In his &quot;Majmu&#x27; al-Fatawa,&quot; he acknowledges the importance of Tasawwuf when practiced in alignment with the Qur&#x27;an and Sunnah. He wrote about the legitimate spiritual practices that lead to purification of the soul (tazkiyah) and the cultivation of sincerity (ikhlas). Ibn Taymiyyah distinguished between genuine Sufi practices and those he considered deviations. For instance, he was critical of certain ecstatic utterances (shath) and practices he viewed as departures from orthodox Islam, but he appreciated the works of early Sufis like Junayd al-Baghdadi and Abdul Qadir Jilani who maintained a firm grounding in Sharia. Moreover, Ibn Taymiyyah himself was buried in a Sufi cemetery, which signifies his recognition and respect within the broader Sufi community . His respect for genuine Sufism is evident in his admiration for Abdul Qadir Jilani, whose teachings emphasized the importance of Sharia compliance along with spiritual devotion . This reverence is not merely theoretical; Ibn Taymiyyah&#x27;s students and followers, such as Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, also echoed his views, furthering the integration of Sufi spirituality with orthodox Islamic practice . Thus, Ibn Taymiyyah&#x27;s approach to Sufism was one of reform rather than outright rejection. He supported Sufi practices that stayed true to Islamic principles and critiqued those that strayed. This balanced perspective is crucial for understanding his relationship with Tasawwuf and dispelling the notion that he was entirely against Sufism .

==== Islamic scholarship ====
Ibn Taymiyya is widely regarded as an anti-rationalist &quot;hater of logic&quot; and a strict literalist who was responsible for the demise of rationalist tendencies within the classical Sunni tradition. Through his polemical treatises such as al-&quot;Radd ‘ala al-mantiqiyyın&quot; (Refutation of the Rationalists); Ibn Taymiyya zealously denounced syllogism, which provided the rational foundations for both &quot;Kalam&quot; (speculative theology) and &quot;Falsafa&quot;.

According to Lebanese philosopher Majid Fakhry, &quot;Ibn Taymiyah protests against the abuses of philosophy and theology and advocates a return to the orthodox ways of the ancients (&quot;al-salaf&quot;)... in his religious zeal he is determined to abolish centuries of religious truth as they had been long before they became troubled by theological and philosophical controversies.&quot;

Jamaat-e Islami leader Abdul Haq Ansari contends the ubiquitous notion that Ibn Taymiyya rejected Sufism outright as erroneous. While &quot;the popular image of Ibn Taymiyya [is] ... that he [criticized] Sufism indiscriminately ... [was] deadly against the Sufis, and ... [saw] no place for Sufism in Islam,&quot; it is historically known, according to the same scholar, that Ibn Taymiyya actually considered &quot;Tasawwuf&quot; to be a significant discipline of Islam. &quot;Far from saying [Sufism] has no place in Islam&quot;, Ibn Taymiyya was on the whole &quot;sympathetic&quot; towards what everyone at the time considered an important aspect of Islamic life. Various scholars have also asserted that Ibn Taymiyya had a deep reverence and appreciation for the works of such major Sufi &quot;Awliyaa&quot; (saints) such as Junayd, Sahl al-Tustari, Abu Talib al-Makki, Bayazid Bastami, etc., and was part of the &quot;Qadiriyya&quot; Sufi order himself. Saudi scholar Hatem al-Awni has criticised Ibn Taymiyya over his sectarian discourse against Ash&#x27;arite and Maturidite schools as well as his creedal beliefs like three-fold classification of &quot;Tawhid&quot; (monotheism).

==== Western scholarship ====

Scholars like Ignac Goldziher described Ibn Taymiyya as a &quot;Hanbalite zealot&quot; who harshly denounced various practices as &quot;bid&#x27;ah&quot; (religious innovations) and rejected all forms of philosophical influences, speculative theology, Sufism and pantheistic doctrines like &quot;Wahdat al-Wujud&quot;.

Others such as the French scholar Henri Laoust (1905–1983) have argued that such portrayals of Ibn Taymiyya are flawed inasmuch as they are often borne of a limited reading of the theologian&#x27;s substantial corpus of works, many of which have not yet been translated from the original Arabic. According to Laoust, Ibn Taymiyya wanted to reform the practice of medieval Sufism as part of his wider aim to reform Sunni Islam (of which Sufism was a major aspect at the time) by divesting both these traditions of what he perceived as heretical innovations within them.

According to James Pavlin, Professor of theology at Rutgers University: &quot;Ibn Taymiyya remains one of the most controversial Islamic thinkers today because of his supposed influence on many fundamentalist movements. The common understanding of his ideas have been filtered through the bits and pieces of his statements that have been misappropriated by alleged supporters and avowed critics alike.&quot;

==Works==
Ibn Taymiyya left behind a considerable body of work, ranging from 350 (according to his student Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya) to 500 (according to his student al-Dhahabi). Oliver Leaman says Ibn Taymiyya produced some 700 works in the field of Islamic sciences. His scholarly output has been described as immense with a wide scope and its contents &quot;bear the marks of brilliant insights hastily jotted down&quot;. In his early life, his work was mostly based on theology and the use of reason in interpretation of scriptural evidences, with later works focusing on refutation of Greek logic, questioning the prevalent practices of the time, and anti-Christian and anti-Shia polemics. Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s total works have not all survived and his extant works of 35 volumes are incomplete. The ascendancy of scholastic interest in his medieval treatises would recommence through the gradual efforts by 18th-century Islamic reform movements. Salafi theologians of Syria, Iraq, and Egypt of the late 19th and early 20th centuries would edit, publish, and mass-circulate many of his censured manuscripts among the Muslim public, making Ibn Taymiyya the most-read classical Islamic theologian in the world; however, as his scholarly impact increased, dissensions and altercations over Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s viewpoints continue to escalate.

===Lost works===
Many of Ibn Taymiyya&#x27;s books are thought to be lost. Their existence is only known through various reports written by scholars throughout history as well as some treatises written by Ibn Taymiyya himself. One particularly notable lost work is &quot;al-Bahr al-Muhit&quot;, which was 40 volumes of Quranic exegesis that Ibn Taymiyya wrote in the prison of Damascus. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani mentions the existence of this work in his work, &quot;al-Durar al-Kamina&quot;.

<doc id="272076" wikidata="Q12821337" url="?curid=272076" title="Dey">
<text>Dey (), from the Turkish honorific title &quot;dayı&quot;, literally meaning uncle, was the title given to the rulers of the regencies of Algiers, Tripolitania, and Tunis under the Ottoman Empire from 1671 onwards. Twenty-nine &quot;deys&quot; held office from the establishment of the deylicate in Algeria until the French conquest in 1830.

The dey was chosen by local civilian, military, and religious leaders to govern for life and ruled with a high degree of autonomy from the Ottoman sultan. The main sources of his revenues were taxes on the agricultural population, religious tributes, and protection payments rendered by Corsairs, regarded as pirates who preyed on Mediterranean shipping. In the European part of the Ottoman Empire, in particular during its decline, leaders of the outlawed janissary and yamak troops sometimes acquired title of Dahi or Dahia, which is derived from Dey.

The dey was assisted in governing made up of the Chiefs of the Army and Navy, the Director of Shipping, the Treasurer-General and the Collector of Tributes.

The realm of the dey of Alger (Algiers) was divided into three provinces (Constantine, Titteri and Mascara), each of which was administered by a bey (باي) whom he appointed.

The rule of the deys of Alger came to an end on 5 July 1830, when Hussein Dey (1765–1838) surrendered to invading French forces.

The last Dey of Tripoli was killed by Ahmed Karamanli, who established the eponymous Karamanli dynasty in 1711.

== Investiture of the deys of Algiers ==
According to Ottoman Algerian dignitary and scholar Hamdan khodja, The Dey or Pasha can only be invested with this dignity by the members of the Divan in their presence, and even when the kaftan and the firman of the Ottoman Porte arrives, it is they who, after having made the election, designate the person of the sovereign to the envoy of the Sublime Porte who comes to bring the nomination of whom they have already nominated.

At each bairam (or feast), this ceremony is renewed in the following way: a meeting is held in a room; the Dey, the one who was appointed, places himself in the middle of the Divan; his re-election is proposed, and when this re-election is made, his diploma is returned to him; but if there is any difference of opinion, another dey is appointed in his place.

In the 18th century, following the coup of Baba Ali Chaouche, the Divan was weakened, as the Deys became stronger. By the 19th century, the Divan was mostly ignored, especially the private Janissary Divan. The dey&#x27;s council, (also called Cabinet by William Shaler) became more and more powerful. Dey Ali Khodja weakened the Janissary Divan to the point where they held no power. This angered the Janissaries, who launched a coup against the Dey. The coup failed, since the Dey successfully raised an army of Kabyle Zwawa cavalry, Arab infantry and Kouloughli troops. Many of the Janissaries were executed, while the rest fled, and the Divan moved to the citadel of the Casbah.

<doc id="272081" wikidata="Q312299" url="?curid=272081" title="Malik ibn Anas">
<text>Malik ibn Anas (; –795) was an Arab Islamic scholar and traditionalist who is the eponym of the Maliki school, one of the four schools of Islamic jurisprudence in Sunni Islam.

Born in Medina into the clan of Banu Himyar, Malik studied under Hisham ibn Urwa, Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, Nafi ibn Sarjis and others. He rose to become the premier scholar of hadith in his day, Referred to as the Imam of Medina by his contemporaries, his views in matters of jurisprudence became highly cherished both in his own life and afterward, becoming the eponym of the Maliki school, one of the four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence. His school became the normative rite for Sunni practice in much of North Africa, al-Andalus (until the expulsion of medieval native Iberian Muslims), a vast portion of Egypt, some parts of Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Iraq, and Khorasan, and the prominent orders in Sufism, the Shadili and Tijani.

Perhaps Malik&#x27;s most famous accomplishment in the annals of Islamic history is, however, his compilation of &quot;al-Muwatta&#x27;&quot;, one of the oldest and most revered Sunni hadith collections and one of &quot;the earliest surviving Muslim law-book[s],&quot; in which Malik attempted to &quot;give a survey of law and justice; ritual and practice of religion according to the consensus of Islam in Medina, according to the sunna usual in Medina; and to create a theoretical standard for matters which were not settled from the point of view of consensus and sunna.&quot; Composed in the early days of the Abbasid caliphate, during which time there was a burgeoning &quot;recognition and appreciation of the canon law&quot; of the ruling party, Malik&#x27;s work aimed to trace out a &quot;smoothed path&quot; (which is what &quot;al-muwaṭṭaʾ&quot; literally means) through &quot;the farreaching differences of opinion even on the most elementary questions.&quot; Hailed as &quot;the soundest book on earth after the Quran&quot; by al-Shafi&#x27;i, the compilation of &quot;al-Muwattaled to Malik being bestowed with such reverential epithets asShaykh al-Islam,Proof of the Community,Imam of the Believers in Hadith,Imam of the Abode of Emigration, andKnowledgeable Scholar of Medina&quot;&#x27; in later Sunni tradition.

According to classical Sunni tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad foretold the birth of Malik, saying: &quot;Very soon will people beat the flanks of camels in search of knowledge and they shall find no one more expert than the knowledgeable scholar of Medina,&quot; and, in another tradition, &quot;The people ... shall set forth from East and West without finding a sage other than the sage of the people in Medina.&quot; While some later scholars, such as Ibn Hazm and al-Tahawi, did cast doubt on identifying the mysterious wise man of both these traditions with Malik, the most widespread interpretation nevertheless continued to be that which held the personage to be Malik. Throughout Islamic history, Malik has been venerated as an exemplary figure in all the traditional schools of Sunni thought, both by the exoteric ulema and by the mystics, with the latter often designating him as a saint in their hagiographies. Malik&#x27;s most notable student, ash-Shafi&#x27;i (who would himself become the founder of another of the four orthodox legal schools of Sunni law), later said of his teacher: &quot;No one constitutes as great a favor to me in the religion of God as Malik ... when the scholars of knowledge are mentioned, Malik is the star.&quot;

==Biography==
Malik&#x27;s genealogy is as follows: Mālik ibn Anas ibn Mālik ibn Abī ʿĀmir ibn ʿAmr ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Ghaymān ibn Khuthayn ibn ʿAmr ibn al-Ḥārith al-Aṣbaḥī al-Ḥumyarī al-Madanī. Malik was born as the son of Anas ibn Malik (not the Sahabi with the same name) and Aaliyah bint Shurayk al-Azdiyya in Medina, . His family was originally from the al-Asbahi tribe of Yemen, but his great grandfather Abu &#x27;Amir relocated the family to Medina after converting to Islam in the second year of the Hijri calendar, or 623 CE. His grandfather Malik ibn Abi Amir was a student of the second Caliph of Islam Umar and was one of those involved in the collection of the parchments upon which Quranic texts were originally written when those were collected during the Caliph Uthman era.

===Teachers===
Living in Medina gave Malik access to some of the most learned minds of early Islam. He memorized the Quran in his youth, learning recitation from Abu Suhail Nafi&#x27; ibn &#x27;Abd ar-Rahman, from whom he also received his Ijazah, or certification and permission to teach others. He studied under various famed scholars including Hisham ibn Urwah and Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri as well as the famed Imam Jafar al-Sadiq.

Both Malik and al Zuhri were student to Nafi Mawla Ibn Umar, prestigious Tabi&#x27;un Imam and freed slave of Abdullah ibn Umar.

Along with Abu Hanifah (founder of the Hanafi Sunni Madh&#x27;hab), Imam Malik, studied also with Imam Jafar a wellknown scholar of his time, who is regarded by Shia muslims as their Imam.

Imam Malik was a teacher of Imam Shafi, who in turn was a teacher of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal.

===Golden Chain of Narration===
Malik&#x27;s chain of narrators was considered the most authentic and called &quot;Silsilat al-Dhahab&quot; or &quot;The Golden Chain of Narrators&quot; by notable hadith scholars including Muhammad al-Bukhari. The &#x27;Golden Chain&#x27; of narration (i.e., that considered by the scholars of Hadith to be the most authentic) consists of Malik, who narrated from Nafi‘ Mawla ibn ‘Umar, who narrated from Ibn Umar, who narrated from Muhammad.

==Views==

===Theology===
Abdul-Ghani Ad-Daqr wrote that Malik was &#x27;the furthest of all people&#x27; from dialectic theology who was the most knowledgeable of their discussions without accepting their views. G.F. Haddad, on the other hand, argued that Malik was not completely averse to the idea of dialectic theology; on the contrary, Haddad points to Malik having studied &#x27;at the feet of Ibn Hurmuz&#x27;, a master in dialectic theology, for &#x27;thirteen to sixteen years&#x27;.

====Anthropomorphism====
Malik&#x27;s unique contributions to the field of theology specifically is that he was a strict opponent of anthropomorphism, and deemed it absurd to compare the attributes of God, with those of man. For example, when a man asked Malik about the meaning of Quran 20:5, &quot;The Merciful made istiwa over the Throne,&quot; it is related that &quot;nothing affected Malik so much as that man&#x27;s question,&quot; and the jurist fervently responded: &quot;The &#x27;how&#x27; of it is not existent; the &#x27;istiwa&#x27; part is known; belief in it is obligatory; asking about it is an innovation.&quot;

====Beatific vision====
Malik was a supporter of the orthodox Sunni doctrine of the beatific vision, and he is said to have cited Quran 75:22-23 (&quot;That day will faces be resplendent, looking toward their Lord,&quot;) and 83:15 (&quot;Nay! Verily, from their Lord, that day, shall they [the transgressors] be veiled,&quot;) as proof of his belief.

====Faith&#x27;s nature====
When he was asked about the nature of faith, Malik defined it as &quot;speech and works&quot; (&quot;qawlun wa-&#x27;amal&quot;), which shows that Malik was averse to the rigorous separation of faith and works.

====Intercession====
Malik seems to have been a proponent of intercession in personal supplication. For example, it is related that when the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur asked Malik about whether it was preferable to face the Prophet&#x27;s tomb or the qibla whilst doing the personal prayer or dua, Malik responded: &quot;Why should you not face him when he is your means (&quot;wasīla&quot;) to God and that of your father Adam on the Day of Resurrection?&quot; Regarding this tradition, the thirteenth-century hadith master Ibn Jamāʿa said: &quot;The report is related by the two hadith masters Ibn Bashkuwāl and al-Qāḍī ʿIyāḍ in &quot;al-Shifā&quot;, and no attention is paid to the words of those who claim that it is forged purely on the basis of their idle desires.&quot; Historically, it is known that Malik&#x27;s statements on the validity of intercession remained a core doctrine of the Maliki school, and practically all Maliki thinkers of the classical era accepted the idea of the Prophet&#x27;s intercession. It is also known, moreover, that the classical &quot;books of the Mālikīs are replete with the stipulation that &quot;du&#x27;ā&quot; [personal supplication] be made while facing the grave.&quot;

====Mysticism====
On the basis of several early traditions, it is evident that Malik held the early Sufis and their practices in high regard. It is related, moreover, that Malik was a strong proponent of combining the &quot;inward science&quot; (&quot;&#x27;ilm al-bātin&quot;) of mystical knowledge with the &quot;outward science&quot; of jurisprudence. For example, the famous twelfth-century Maliki jurist and judge Qadi Iyad, later venerated as a saint throughout the Iberian Peninsula, narrated a tradition in which a man asked Malik &quot;about something in the inward science,&quot; to which Malik replied: &quot;Truly none knows the inward science except those who know the outward science! When he knows the outward science and puts it into practice, God shall open for him the inward science - and that will not take place except by the opening of his heart and its enlightenment.&quot;
While there are a few traditions relating that Malik, while not an opponent of mysticism as a whole, was nonetheless adverse specifically to the practice of group dhikr, such traditions have been graded as being &quot;munkar&quot; or &quot;weak&quot; in their chain of transmission. Furthermore, it has been argued that none of these reports - all of which relate Malik&#x27;s disapproving amusement at being told about an instance of group dhikr happening nearby - explicitly display any disapproval of the act as such, but rather serve as a criticism of &quot;some people who passed for Sufis in his time [who] apparently committed certain excesses or breaches of the sacred law.&quot; As both their chains of transmission are weak and not consistent with what is related of Malik elsewhere, the traditions are rejected by many scholars, although latter-day critics of Sufism do occasionally cite them in support of their position.

===Relics===
Malik was a supporter of &quot;tabarruk&quot; or the &quot;seeking of blessing through [the veneration of] relics.&quot; This is evident, for example, in the fact that Malik approvingly related the tradition of Atā&#x27; ibn Abī Rabāh, whom he saw &quot;enter the [Prophet&#x27;s] Mosque, then take hold of the pommel of the Pulpit, after which he faced the &quot;qibla&quot; [to pray],&quot; thereby supporting the holding of the pommel for its blessings (&quot;baraka&quot;) by virtue of its having touched Muhammad. Furthermore, it is also recorded that &quot;when one of the caliphs manifested his intention to replace the wooden pulpit of the Prophet with a pulpit of silver and jewels,&quot; Malik exclaimed: &quot;I do not consider it good that people be deprived of the relics of the Messenger of God!&quot; (&quot;Lā arā yuḥrama al-nāsu āthāra rasūlillāh&quot;).

===Sunnah of Muhammad===

Malik considered following the sunnah of Muhammad to be of capital importance for every Muslim. It is reported that he said: &quot;The sunnah is Noah&#x27;s Ark. Whoever boards it is saved, and whoever remains away from it perishes.&quot;

===Ethics===

====Differences of opinion====

Accounts of Malik&#x27;s life demonstrate that the scholar cherished differences of opinion amongst the ulema as a mercy from God to the Islamic community. Even &quot;in Malik&#x27;s time there were those who forwarded the idea of a unified &quot;madhhab&quot; and the ostensive removal of all differences between the Sunni schools of law,&quot; with &quot;three successive caliphs&quot; having sought to &quot;impose the &quot;Muwatta&quot; and Malik&#x27;s school upon the entire Islamic world of their time,&quot; but &quot;Malik refused to allow it every time ... [for he held that the differences in opinion among the jurists]&quot; were a &quot;mercy&quot; for the people. When the second Abbasid caliph al-Mansur said to Malik: &quot;I want to unify this knowledge. I shall write to the leaders of the armies and to the rulers so that they make it law, and whoever contravenes it shall be put to death,&quot; Malik is said to have responded: &quot;Commander of the Believers, there is another way. Truly, the Prophet was present in this community, he used to send out troops or set forth in person, and he did not conquer many lands until God took back his soul. Then Abu Bakr arose and he also did not conquer many lands. Then Umar arose after the two of them and many lands were conquered at his hands. As a result, he faced the necessity of sending out the companions of Muhammad as teachers and people did not cease to take from them, notable scholars from notable scholars until our time. If you now go and change them from what they know to what they do not know they shall deem it disbelief (&quot;kufr&quot;). Rather, confirm the people of each land with regard to whatever knowledge is there, and take this knowledge to yourself.&quot;

According to another narration, al-Mansur, after hearing Malik&#x27;s answers to certain important questions, said: &quot;I have resolved to give the order that your writings be copied and disseminated to every Muslim region on earth, so that they be put in practice exclusively of any other rulings. They will leave aside innovations and keep only this knowledge. For I consider that the source of knowledge is the narrative tradition of Medina and the knowledge of its scholars.&quot; To this, Malik is said to have replied: &quot;Commander of the Believers, do not! For people have already heard different positions, heard &quot;hadith&quot;, and related narrations. Every group has taken whatever came to them and put it into practice, conforming to it while other people differed. To take them away from what they have been professing will cause a disaster. Therefore, leave people with whatever school they follow and whatever the people of each country chose for themselves.&quot;

====Knowing the limits of knowledge====
Malik is famous for declaring: &quot;The shield of the &#x27;alim is: &#x27;I do not know.&#x27; If he neglects it, he will receive a mortal blow.&quot; Elsewhere, a certain Khālid ibn Khidāsh related: &quot;I travelled all the way from Iraq to see Mālik about forty questions. He did not answer me except on five. Then he said: ʿIbn ʿIjlān used to say: If the &#x27;alim bypasses &#x27;I do not know,&#x27; he will receive a mortal blow.&quot; Likewise, al-Haytham ibn Jamīl said: &quot;I saw Mālik ibn Anas being asked forty-eight questions, and he replied to thirty-two of them: &#x27;I do not know.&#x27;&quot; Later on, Malik&#x27;s disciple, Ibn Wahb, related: &quot;I heard ʿAbd Allāh ibn Yazīd ibn Hurmuz say: &#x27;The &#x27;ulema must instill in those who sit with him the phrase &#x27;I do not know&#x27; until it becomes a foundational principle (&quot;asl&quot;) before them and they seek refuge in it from danger.&quot;

====Religious disputation====
Malik is said to have detested disputing in matters of religion, saying: &quot;Disputation (&quot;al-jidāl)&quot; in the religion fosters self-display, does away with the light of the heart and hardens it, and produces aimless wandering.&quot; Needless argument, therefore, was disapproved of by Malik, and he also chose to keep silent about religious matters in general unless he felt obliged to speak in fear of &quot;the spread of misguidance or some similar danger.&quot;

===Social===
====Shaving the moustache====
In the &quot;Muwatta&quot;, Malik writes: &quot;Shaving the mustache is an innovation.&quot; Elsewhere, it is written that he &quot;detested and condemned&quot; shaving of the mustache and, furthermore, &quot;disliked inordinate length for the beard.&quot; While several other scholars held both the clipping (&quot;qass&quot;) and the removal (&quot;ihfā&quot;&#x27;) of the mustache to be sunnah, Malik only considered the former to be truly prophetically prescribed, deeming the latter an unpalatable innovation.

==Physical appearance==
The available physical descriptions of Malik relate that he &quot;was tall, heavy-set, imposing of stature, very fair, with white beard ... [and] bald ... [with] blue eyes.&quot; Furthermore, it is also related that &quot;he always wore beautiful clothes, especially [those that were] white.&quot;

==Death==
Imam Malik died at the age of 83 or 84 in Medina in 795 CE, and is buried in the cemetery of Al-Baqi&#x27;, across from the Mosque of the Prophet. Although there was a small shrine constructed around his grave during the late medieval period, with many Muslims visiting it to pay their respects, the construction was razed to the ground by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during their campaign of demolishing many of the traditional Islamic heritage sites after the kingdom&#x27;s establishment in 1932.

Malik&#x27;s last words were related to one Isma&#x27;il ibn Abi Uways who said, &quot;Malik became sick, so I asked some of our people about what he said at the time of his death. They said, &quot;He recited the testification of faith and then he recited:&quot; To Allah belongs the command [i.e., decree] before and after.&quot;

Abbasid governor of Mecca and Medina, Abdallah al-Zaynabi led the prayers at the funeral of Malik ibn Anas in 795.

<text>Bram Fischer International Airport () is a primary airport located in Bloemfontein, the capital city of the Free State province of South Africa. The runways are shared with AFB Bloemspruit.

== History ==
The airport was opened in November 1961 and the runways were completed before the terminal buildings so that the South African Airforce could make use of them.

Bloemfontein Airport, like many others in South Africa, underwent R46 million&#x27;s worth of construction and upgrading of the whole airport in preparation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

In November 2012, the South African government announced that the airport&#x27;s name was to be changed to Bram Fischer International Airport; the official renaming was performed by Pres. Jacob Zuma on Thursday, 13 December 2012.

==Facilities==
The main terminal building is used for both international and domestic flights. In 2023, the airport served 346,373 passengers.

<text>Muhammad ibn Isa al-Tirmidhi (; 824 – 9 October 892 CE / 209–279 AH), often referred to as Imām at-Termezī/Tirmidhī, was an Islamic scholar, and collector of hadith from Termez (early Khorasan and in present-day Uzbekistan). He wrote &quot;al-Jami` as-Sahih&quot; (known as &quot;Jami` at-Tirmidhi&quot;), one of the six canonical hadith compilations in Sunni Islam. He also wrote &quot;Shama&#x27;il Muhammadiyah&quot; (popularly known as &quot;Shama&#x27;il at-Tirmidhi&quot;), a compilation of hadiths concerning the person and character of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. At-Tirmidhi was also well versed in Arabic grammar, favoring the school of Kufa over Basra due to the former&#x27;s preservation of Arabic poetry as a primary source.

==Biography==

===Name and lineage===

Al-Tirmidhi&#x27;s given name (&quot;ism&quot;) was &quot;Muhammad&quot; while his &quot;kunya&quot; was &quot;Abu `Isa&quot; (&quot;father of `Isa&quot;). His genealogy is uncertain; his &quot;nasab&quot; (patronymic) has variously been given as:
* Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Sawrah ()‎
* Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Sawrah ibn Mūsá ibn aḍ-Ḍaḥḥāk ()‎
* Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Sawrah ibn Shaddād ()‎
* Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Sawrah ibn Shaddād ibn aḍ-Ḍaḥḥāk ()‎
* Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Sawrah ibn Shaddād ibn ‛Īsá ()‎
* Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Yazīd ibn Sawrah ibn as-Sakan ()‎
* Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Sahl ()‎
* Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Sahl ibn Sawrah ()‎

He was also known by the &quot;laqab&quot; &quot;ad-Darir&quot; (&quot;the Blind&quot;). It has been said that he was born blind, but the majority of scholars agree that he became blind later in his life.

At-Tirmidhi&#x27;s grandfather was originally from Marw (Persian: Merv), but moved to Tirmidh. 
According to &quot;Britannica Online&quot;, he was an Arab. According to S.H. Nasr and M. Mutahhari in &quot;The Cambridge History of Iran&quot;, Al-Tirmidhi was of Persian ethnicity. His uncle was the famous Sufi Abu Bakr al-Warraq. Al-Warraq was the teacher of Al-Hakim al-Samarqandi, a known associate of the famous theologian Abu Mansur Al-Maturidi.

===Birth===
Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi was born during the reign of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun. His year of birth has been reported as 209 AH (824/825). Adh-Dhahabi only states that at-Tirmidhi was born near the year 210 AH (825/826), thus some sources give his year of birth as 210 AH. Some sources indicate that he was born in Mecca (Siddiqi says he was born in Mecca in 206 AH (821/822)) while others say he was born in Tirmidh (Persian: Termez), in what is now southern Uzbekistan. The stronger opinion is that he was born in Tirmidh. Specifically, he was born in one of its suburbs, the village of Bugh (hence the &quot;nisbats&quot; &quot;at-Tirmidhi&quot; and &quot;al-Bughi&quot;).

===Hadith studies===
At-Tirmidhi began the study of hadith at the age of 20. From the year 235 AH (849/850) he traveled widely in Khurasan, Iraq, and the Hijaz in order to collect hadith. His teachers and those he narrated from included:
* al-Bukhari
* Abū Rajā’ Qutaybah ibn Sa‘īd al-Balkhī al-Baghlāni
* ‘Alī ibn Ḥujr ibn Iyās as-Sa‘dī al-Marwazī
* Muḥammad ibn Bashshār al-Baṣrī
* ‘Abd Allāh ibn Mu‘āwiyah al-Jumaḥī al-Baṣrī
* Abū Muṣ‘ab az-Zuhrī al-Madanī
* Muḥammad ibn ‘Abd al-Mālik ibn Abī ash-Shawārib al-Umawī al-Baṣrī
* Ismā‘īl ibn Mūsá al-Fazārī al-Kūfi
* Muḥammad ibn Abī Ma‘shar as-Sindī al-Madanī
* Abū Kurayb Muḥammad ibn al-‘Alā’ al-Kūfī
* Hanād ibn al-Sarī al-Kūfī
* Ibrāhīm ibn ‘Abd Allāh al-Harawī
* Suwayd ibn Naṣr ibn Suwayd al-Marwazī
* Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Baṣrī
* Zayd ibn Akhzam al-Baṣrī
* al-‘Abbās al-‘Anbarī al-Baṣrī
* Muḥammad ibn al-Muthanná al-Baṣrī
* Muḥammad ibn Ma‘mar al-Baṣrī
* ad-Darimi
* Muslim
* Abu Dawud

At the time, Khurasan, at-Tirmidhi&#x27;s native land, was a major center of learning, being home to a large number of &quot;muhaddiths&quot;. Other major centers of learning visited by at-Tirmidhi were the Iraqi cities of Kufa and Basra. At-Tirmidhi reported hadith from 42 Kufan teachers. In his &quot;Jami`&quot;, he used more reports from Kufan teachers than from teachers of any other town.

At-Tirmidhi was a pupil of al-Bukhari, who was based in Khurasan. Adh-Dhahabi wrote, &quot;His knowledge of hadith came from al-Bukhari.&quot; At-Tirmidhi mentioned al-Bukhari&#x27;s name 114 times in his &quot;Jami`&quot;. He used al-Bukhari&#x27;s &quot;Kitab at-Tarikh&quot; as a source when mentioning discrepancies in the text of a hadith or its transmitters, and praised al-Bukhari as being the most knowledgeable person in Iraq or Khurasan in the science of discrepancies of hadith. When mentioning the rulings of jurists, he followed al-Bukhari&#x27;s practice of not mentioning the name of Abu Hanifah. Because he never received a reliable chain of narrators to mention Abu Hanifa&#x27;s decrees, he would instead attribute them to &quot;some people of Kufa.&quot; Al-Bukhari held at-Tirmidhi in high regard as well. He is reported to have told at-Tirmidhi, &quot;I have profited more from you than you have from me,&quot; and in his &quot;Sahih&quot; he narrated two hadith from at-Tirmidhi.

At-Tirmidhi also narrated some hadiths from Abu Dawud, and one from Muslim. Muslim also narrated one hadith from at-Tirmidhi in his own &quot;Sahih&quot;.

A.J. Wensinck mentions Ahmad ibn Hanbal as among at-Tirmidhi&#x27;s teachers. However, Hoosen states that according to the most reliable sources, at-Tirmidhi never went to Baghdad, nor did he attend any lectures of Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Furthermore, at-Tirmidhi never directly narrates from Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his &quot;Jami`&quot;.

Several of at-Tirmidhi&#x27;s teachers also taught al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, and an-Nasa&#x27;i.

===Writings===
* &quot;Al-Jami&#x27; al-Mukhtasar min as-Sunan &#x27;an Rasul Allah&quot;, known as &quot;Jami&#x27; at-Tirmidhi&quot;
* &quot;Al-&#x27;Ilal as-Sughra&quot;
* &quot;Az-Zuhd&quot;
* &quot;Al-&#x27;Ilal al-Kubra&quot;
* &quot;Ash-Shama&#x27;il an-Nabawiyya wa&#x27;l-Fada&#x27;il al-Mustafawiyya&quot;
* &quot;Al-Asma&#x27; wa&#x27;l-Kuna&quot;
* &quot;Kitab at-Tarikh&quot;

He is also reported to have a work on Islamic history and an exegesis of the Qur’an, but these are extinct.

==Death==
At-Tirmidhi was blind in the last two years of his life, according to adh-Dhahabi. His blindness is said to have been the consequence of excessive weeping, either due to fear of God or over the death of al-Bukhari.

He died on Monday night, 13 Rajab 279 AH (Sunday night, 8 October 892) in Bugh.

At-Tirmidhi is buried on the outskirts of Sherobod, 60 kilometers north of Termez in Uzbekistan. In Termez he is locally known as Abu Isa at-Termezi or &quot;Termez Ota&quot; (&quot;Father of Termez&quot;).

<text>Upington International Airport is an airport located in Upington, Northern Cape, South Africa. At , runway 17/35 is one of the longest runways in the world. The high elevation of the airport, extremely high summer temperatures and the fact that it was designed for the Boeing 747 necessitated the extreme length of the main runway.

==History==
With the fall of the Portuguese regime in Angola, South African Airways lost its landing rights in Luanda. In addition to restrictions to overflying African states, there was concern that the country would lose its landing rights at the Ivory Coast and Ilha do Sal, Cape Verde.

Upington Airport&#x27;s runway was built to accommodate a Boeing 747 with a full load of passengers, cargo and fuel, so that it could take off for Europe without having to stop along the way. Upington was chosen because of its strategic position, availability of land and comparatively lower height above sea level than Johannesburg.

Upington Airport was opened in 1968 as Pierre van Ryneveld Airport. In 1974, a corrugated iron fire station was erected but this structure was converted into administrative offices for airport management and other administrative staff in 1996 and the fire station was relocated.

From August 1976 to December 1982, South African Airways made use of Upington as a refuelling station for two weekly scheduled Boeing 747 flights to London and Zürich.

The Concorde did flight testing at Upington Airport in June 1976.

, Upington Airport was to be developed into a major cargo hub that will serve sub-Saharan Africa directly from South Africa&#x27;s Northern Cape Province.

As of 2009, planning was also under way at Upington Airport to construct a facility for the long-term parking of &quot;mothballed&quot; (decommissioned) aircraft.

As well as improvements to the airport itself, ACSA has built a solar farm located on 0.66 hectares of land within the airport precinct, capable of producing 500 kW during peak production each year.

==Airlines and destinations==

==Non-scheduled services==
Upington Airport serves as an international cargo hub. Most flights are non-scheduled chartered flights operating in the months of November to January to export grapes from the region directly to Europe and other countries. As much as 1,000,000 tonnes of grapes are exported every year.

Many major car manufacturers bring their cars and commercial vehicles to Upington to test them in the hot dry and sunny conditions, when there is winter in Europe. These cars and test teams are flown into and out of Upington Airport using chartered planes. Cars used the N14 between Pofadder and Kakamas. The road has a speed limit of for authorized vehicles

<doc id="272091" wikidata="Q2604867" url="?curid=272091" title="Udug">
<text>The udug (), later known in Akkadian as the utukku, were an ambiguous class of demons from ancient Mesopotamian mythology found in the literature of Sumer, Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia. They were different from the dingir (Anu-nna-Ki and Igigi) and they were generally malicious, even if a member of demons (Pazuzu) was willing to clash both with other demons and with the gods, even if he is described as a presence hostile to humans. The word is generally ambiguous and is sometimes used to refer to demons as a whole rather than a specific kind of demon. No visual representations of the udug have yet been identified, but descriptions of it ascribe to it features often given to other ancient Mesopotamian demons: a dark shadow, absence of light surrounding it, poison, and a deafening voice. The surviving ancient Mesopotamian texts giving instructions for exorcizing the evil udug are known as the &quot;Udug Hul&quot; texts. These texts emphasize the evil udug&#x27;s role in causing disease and the exorcist&#x27;s role in curing the disease.

==Appearance==
Only a few descriptions of the udug are known and, according to Gina Konstantopoulos, no pictorial or visual representations of them have ever been identified. According to Tally Ornan, however, some Mesopotamian cylinder seals show a figure carrying a scepter alongside the benevolent guard demoness Lama, which may be identified as the udug. F. A. M. Wiggerman has argued that images of Lama and the udug were frequently used to guard doorways.

In a bilingual incantation written in both Sumerian and Akkadian, the god Asalluḫi describes the &quot;evil udug&quot; to his father Enki:
&lt;poem&gt;
O my father, the evil udug [&quot;udug hul&quot;], its appearance is malignant and its stature towering,
Although it is not a god (dingir) its clamour is great and its radiance [&quot;melam&quot;] immense,
It is dark, its shadow is pitch black and there is no light within its body,
It always hides, taking refuge, [it] does not stand proudly,
Its claws drip with bile, it leaves poison in its wake,
Its belt is not released, his arms &quot;enclose&quot;,
It fills the target of his anger with tears, in all lands, [its] battle cry cannot be restrained.&lt;/poem&gt;

This description mostly glosses over what the udug actually looks like, instead focusing more on its fearsome supernatural abilities. All the characteristics ascribed to the &quot;evil udug&quot; here are common features that are frequently attributed to all different kinds of ancient Mesopotamian demons: a dark shadow, absence of light surrounding it, poison, and a deafening voice. Other descriptions of the udug are not consistent with this one and often contradict it. Konstantopoulos notes that &quot;the udug is defined by what it is not: the demon is nameless and formless, even in its early appearances.&quot; An incantation from the Old Babylonian Period ( 1830 – 1531 BC) defines the udug as &quot;the one who, from the beginning, was not called by name... the one who never appeared with a form.&quot;
One of the udug could be Hanbi.
In Sumerian and Akkadian mythology (and Mesopotamian mythology in general) Hanbi or Hanpa (more commonly known in western text) was the god of evil, god of all evil forces and the father of Pazuzu. Aside from his relationship with Pazuzu, very little is known of this figure.

* Mimma Lemnu (Sumerian name used for a demon and for a ritual)
* Hanbi (Sumerian lord of the shadow demon called udug)
* Ardat Lili (Sumerian shadow demon parly woman, partly dog and partly scorpion, devourer of children)
* Vardat Lilitu (Sumerian vampire shadow demon, devourer of children-the babylonians modified her origin)
* Alu/Lilu (Sumerian shadow demon without face)
* Pazuzu (Sumerian king shadow demon of the wind)
* Mukil Res Lemutti (Sumerian shadow demon capable of possessing people&#x27;s bodies and omen of misfortune)
* Namtar (Sumerian shadow demon ally with the dingir of the afterlife Ereshkigal)
* Ti&#x27;u (Sumerian shadow demon of heartache)
* Dimme-Kurr/Akhkhazu
* Kilili (Sumerian shadow demon of the owls, ally with the dingir Inanna)
* Labasù (Sumerian shadow demon disease bearer)
* Abyzou (Sumerian shadow demon devourer of children)
* Sathass (Sumerian shadow demon, enemy of the afterlife gods)

==Identity==
Of all Mesopotamian demons, the udug is the least clearly defined. The word originally did not connote whether the demon in question was good or evil. In one of the two Gudea cylinders, King Gudea of Lagash (ruled 2144–2124 BCE) asks a goddess to send a &quot;good udug&quot; to protect him and a lama to guide him. Surviving ancient Mesopotamian texts giving instructions for performing exorcisms frequently invoke the &quot;good udug&quot; to provide protection or other aid as the exorcism is being performed. Mesopotamian magical texts, however, also mention a specific &quot;evil udug&quot; as well as plural &quot;udugs&quot;, who are also referred to as evil. The phrase for &quot;evil udug&quot; is &quot;Udug Hul&quot; in Sumerian and &quot;Utukkū Lemnutū&quot; in Akkadian. The evil udug is often a vector for physical and mental illnesses.

The word &quot;udug&quot; by itself without a qualifier usually connotes the evil udug. Exorcism texts sometimes invoke the &quot;good udug&quot; against the &quot;evil udug&quot;. A text from the Old Babylonian Period ( 1830 – 1531 BCE) requests, &quot;May the evil udug and the evil &quot;galla&quot; stand aside. May the good udug and good &quot;galla&quot; be present.&quot; Sometimes the word &quot;udug&quot; does not even refer to a specific demon, but rather functions as an umbrella term for all the different demons in Mesopotamian demonology. On account of the udug&#x27;s capacity for both good and ill, Graham Cunningham argues that &quot;the term daimon seems preferable&quot; over the term &quot;demon&quot;, which is the one normally used to describe it.
==Udug hul incantations==
The canon of exorcism of the evil udug is known as &quot;udug-ḫul&quot;, the Akkadian expansion of which (known in Akkadian as &quot;utukkū lemnūtu&quot;) is in sixteen tablets. The tradition of &quot;Udug Hul&quot; incantations spans the entirety of ancient Mesopotamian history; they are among the earliest texts known written in Sumerian in the third millennium BCE, as well as among the last Mesopotamian texts of late antiquity, written in cuneiform with Greek transliterations. The &quot;udug-ḫul&quot; incantations were originally unilingual and written in Sumerian, but these earliest versions were later converted into bilingual texts written in both Sumerian and Akkadian. They were also expanded with additions written only in Akkadian with no Sumerian precursors. The &quot;udug-ḫul&quot; incantations emphasize the role of the evil udug as the cause of sickness and focus primarily on attempting to drive out the evil udug to cure the illness. They frequently contain references to Mesopotamian mythology, such as the myth of &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent into the Underworld&quot;.

This name is commonly translated as &quot;exterminator&quot; or &quot;obliterating one&quot; due to being most likely derived from the Akkadian verb pašāṭum, &quot;to erase&quot;.[8] In another lexical list its Sumerian equivalent is KA-im-ma.[9]
While the being designated by this name could be regarded as a demon, she belonged to the category of demonic animals, possibly representing a demonized owl.[11]
Frans Wiggermann argues this likely indicates Lamashtu was also regarded as a lil, as Pazuzu was believed to have power over her.[16] However, Eric Schmidtchen notes it can be argued that in standardized lists of demons they are divided in three groups, utukku, lil and KAMAD.[17] The last of them is distinct from the lil and encompasses Lamashtu and related figures like aḫḫazu and labāṣu.[18]

<text>Francis Hutchinson (2 January 1660 – 1739) was a British minister in Bury St Edmunds when he wrote a famous book debunking witchcraft prosecutions and subsequently was made Bishop of Down and Connor in Ireland.

==Education==

Hutchinson was born in Carsington, Wirksworth, Derbyshire, the second son of Mary and Edward Hutchinson or Hitchinson (a family of the lesser landed gentry). He was taught history by his uncle, Francis Tallents, a Puritan clergyman, before beginning his studies at Katharine Hall, Cambridgein 1678. Hutchinson graduated B.A. in 1681 and M.A. in 1684, a year after he was ordained by the bishop of London and was appointed Lecturer at the rectory of Widdington, Essex. This living represented the lowest rung of the career ladder of the Church of England and Hutchinson remained there until appointed vicar of Hoxne, Suffolk in early 1690 by local Whig magnate, William Maynard. Hutchinson received a D.D. from Cambridge in 1698.

==Bury St Edmunds and &quot;An Historical Essay Concerning Witchcraft&quot;==

Sometime before 1692, Hutchinson became a minister and perpetual curate at St. James parish in Bury St Edmunds and this may have led to an interest in researching the infamous trials that had occurred there. In 1700, a skeptical book about the 1692 Salem witch trials by Robert Calef was printed in London and in his own book Hutchinson praises and recommends Calef&#x27;s work, providing the name of the bookseller in London. Calef had emigrated to Boston from the town of Stanstead, only eleven miles south of Bury. By 1706, Hutchinson was passing around a draft of a book that would come to be called &quot;An Historical Essay Concerning Witchcraft&quot; but was discouraged by influential friends from publishing. In 1712, Hutchinson experienced the local trial of Jane Wenham firsthand and again considered publishing, but again demurred. &quot;Writing about witchcraft is a tricky business,&quot; as Ian Bostridge notes regarding Hutchinson&#x27;s process. A few years later a book appeared by Richard Boulton which Hutchinson detested, and this seem to have finally galled him into publishing his book in 1718. It was a lengthy work carefully and patiently deconstructing and dissecting witch-hunting and the witchcraft prosecutions in East Anglia and other parts of England, as well as New England, and &quot;applied a consciously rational approach to the phenomenon.&quot; Historian Wallace Notestein, writing in 1911, ends a similar survey in 1718 &quot;because that year marked the publication of Francis Hutchinson&#x27;s notable attack.&quot; Notestein calls it &quot;epoch-making&quot; and writes, &quot;Hutchinson levelled a final and deadly blow at the dying superstition.&quot;Ian Bostridge suggests Hutchinson&#x27;s delays in publishing the work &quot;indicates how contentious the subject was, within the elite circles in which Hutchinson moved.&quot; Bostridge does not diminish the importance of Hutchinson&#x27;s book, but presents the vote to repeal of the Witchcraft Act in 1735 as politically complex event and not a foregone conclusion.

==Ireland==
In early 1721, Hutchinson was consecrated bishop of Down and Conner and took up residence in Lisburn, in modern-day Northern Ireland. He died in 1739, aged 79, and was buried in Portglenone Parish Church, County Antrim.

==Works==
*An Historical Essay Concerning Witchcraft (1718) and a subsequent edition (1720).

Note that while the second edition has a larger type, generous spacing, an illustration, and advertisements, it seems to add no more content from Hutchinson, but omits one essay from the 1718 edition (&quot;A Defence of the Compassionate Address to Papists&quot;).

<doc id="272095" wikidata="Q190944" url="?curid=272095" title="Jean Bodin">
<text>Jean Bodin (; ; – 1596) was a French jurist and political philosopher, member of the Parlement of Paris and professor of law in Toulouse. Bodin lived during the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation and wrote against the background of religious conflict in France. He seemed to be a nominal Catholic throughout his life but was critical of papal authority over governments and there was evidence he may have converted to Protestantism during his time in Geneva. Known for his theory of sovereignty, he favoured the strong central control of a national monarchy as an antidote to factional strife.

Towards the end of his life he wrote a dialogue among different religions, including representatives of Judaism, Islam and natural theology in which all agreed to coexist in concord, but was not published. He was also an influential writer on demonology, as his later years were spent during the peak of the early modern witch trials.

==Life==
Jean Bodin was successively a friar, academic, professional lawyer, and political adviser. An excursion as a politician having proved a failure, he lived out his life as a provincial magistrate.

===Early life===
Bodin was born near Angers, possibly the son of a master tailor, into a modestly prosperous middle-class background. He received a decent education, apparently in the Carmelite monastery of Angers, where he became a novice friar. Some claims made about his early life remain obscure. There is some evidence of a visit to Geneva in 1547–48 in which he became involved in a heresy trial. The records of this episode, however, are murky and may refer to another person.

===Paris and Toulouse===
Bodin obtained release from his vows in 1549 and went to Paris. He studied at the university, but also at the humanist-oriented &quot;Collège des Quatre Langues&quot; (now the Collège de France); he was for two years a student under Guillaume Prévost, a little-known &quot;magister&quot; in philosophy. His education was not only influenced by an orthodox Scholastic approach but was also apparently in contact with Ramist philosophy (the thought of Petrus Ramus).

Later, in the 1550s, he studied Roman law at the University of Toulouse, under Arnaud du Ferrier, and taught there. His special subject at that time seems to have been comparative jurisprudence. Subsequently, he worked on a Latin translation of Oppian of Apamea, under the continuing patronage of Gabriel Bouvery, Bishop of Angers. Bodin had a plan for a school on humanist principles in Toulouse, but failed to raise local support. He left in 1560.

===The Wars of Religion and the &quot;politiques&quot;===
From 1561, Bodin was licensed as an attorney of the &quot;Parlement&quot; of Paris. His religious convictions on the outbreak of the Wars of Religion in 1562 cannot be determined, but he affirmed formally his Catholic faith, taking an oath that year along with other members of the Parlement. He continued to pursue his interests in legal and political theory in Paris, publishing significant works on historiography and economics.

Bodin became a member of the discussion circles around the Prince François d&#x27;Alençon (or d&#x27;Anjou from 1576). He was the intelligent and ambitious youngest son of Henry II, and was in line for the throne in 1574, with the death of his brother Charles IX. He withdrew his claim, however, in favor of his older brother Henry III, who had recently returned from his abortive effort to reign as the King of Poland. Alençon was a leader of the &quot;politiques&quot; faction of political pragmatists.

===Under Henry III===
After the failure of Prince François&#x27; hopes to ascend the throne, Bodin transferred his allegiance to the new king Henry III. In practical politics, however, he lost the king&#x27;s favor in 1576–7, as delegate of the Third Estate at the Estates-General at Blois, and leader in his Estate of the February 1577 moves to prevent a new war against the Huguenots. He attempted to exert a moderating influence on the Catholic party, and also tried restrict the passage of supplemental taxation for the king. Bodin then retired from political life; he had married in February 1576. His wife, Françoise Trouillart, was the widow of Claude Bayard, and sister of Nicolas Trouillart who died in 1587; both were royal attorneys in the Provost of Laon and attorneys in the Bailiwick of Vermandois, and Bodin took over the charges.

Jean Bodin was in touch with William Wade in Paris, Lord Burghley&#x27;s contact, at the time (1576) of publication of the &quot;Six livres&quot;. He later accompanied Prince François, by then Duke of Anjou, to England in 1581, in his second attempt to woo Elizabeth I of England. On this visit, Bodin saw the English Parliament. He brushed off a request to secure better treatment for English Catholics, to the dismay of Robert Persons, given that Edmund Campion was in prison at the time. Bodin saw some of Campion&#x27;s trial, he is said also to have witnessed Campion&#x27;s execution in December 1581, making the hanging the occasion for a public letter against the use of force in matters of religion. Bodin became a correspondent of Francis Walsingham; and Michel de Castelnau passed on to Mary, Queen of Scots a prophecy supposed to be Bodin&#x27;s, on the death of Elizabeth, at the time of the Babington Plot.

Prince François became Duke of Brabant in 1582, however, and embarked on an adventurer&#x27;s campaign to expand his territory. The disapproving Bodin accompanied him, and was trapped in the Prince&#x27;s disastrous raid on Antwerp that ended the attempt, followed shortly by the Prince&#x27;s death in 1584.

===Last years===
In the wars that followed the death of Henry III (1589), the Catholic League attempted to prevent the succession of the Protestant Henry of Navarre by placing another king on the throne. Bodin initially gave support to the powerful League; he felt it inevitable that they would score a quick victory.

Jean Bodin died, in Laon, during one of the many plague epidemics of the time.

==Books==
Bodin generally wrote in French, with later Latin translations. Several of the works have been seen as influenced by Ramism, at least in terms of structure.

Bodin wrote in turn books on history, economics, politics, demonology, and natural philosophy; and also left a (later notorious) work in manuscript on religion (see under &quot;Religious tolerance&quot;). A modern edition of Bodin&#x27;s works was begun in 1951 as &quot;Oeuvres philosophiques de Jean Bodin&quot; by , but only one volume appeared.

===&quot;Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem&quot;===
In France, Bodin was noted as a historian for his &quot;Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem&quot; (1566) (&quot;Method for the easy knowledge of history&quot;). He wrote, &quot;Of history, that is, the true narration of things, there are three kinds: human, natural and divine&quot;. This book was one of the most significant contributions to the &quot;ars historica&quot; of the period, and distinctively put an emphasis on the role of political knowledge in interpreting historical writings. He pointed out that the knowledge of historical legal systems could be useful for contemporary legislation.

The &quot;Methodus&quot; was a successful and influential manual on the writing of technical history. It answered by means of detailed historiographical advice the skeptical line on the possibility of historical knowledge advanced by Francesco Patrizzi. It also expanded the view of historical &quot;data&quot; found in earlier humanists, with the immediacy of its concerns for the social side of human life.

Jean Bodin rejected the biblical Four Monarchies model, taking an unpopular position at the time, as well as the classical theory of a Golden Age for its naiveté. He also dropped much of the rhetorical apparatus of the humanists.

===Economic thought: the &quot;Reply to Malestroit&quot;===
The &quot;Réponse de J. Bodin aux paradoxes de M. de Malestroit&quot; (1568) was a tract, provoked by theories of Jean de Malestroit, in which Bodin offered one of the earliest scholarly analyses of the phenomenon of inflation, unknown prior to the 16th century. The background to discussion in the 1560s was that by 1550 an increase in the money supply in Western Europe had brought general benefits. But there had also been appreciable inflation. Silver arriving via Spain from the South American mine of Potosí, together with other sources of silver and gold, from other new sources, was causing monetary change.

Bodin was after Martín de Azpilicueta, who had alluded to the issue in 1556 (something noticed also by Gómara in his unpublished &quot;Annals&quot;), an early observer that the rise in prices was due in large part to the influx of precious metals. Analysing the phenomenon, amongst other factors he pointed to the relationship between the amount of goods and the amount of money in circulation. The debates of the time laid the foundation for the &quot;quantity theory of money&quot;. Bodin mentioned other factors: population increase, trade, the possibility of economic migration, and consumption that he saw as profligate.

===The &quot;Theatrum&quot;===
The &quot;Theatrum Universae Naturae&quot; is Bodin&#x27;s statement of natural philosophy. It contains many particular and even idiosyncratic personal views, for instance that eclipses are related to political events. It argued against the certainty of the astronomical theory of stellar parallax, and the terrestrial origin of the &quot;comet of 1573&quot; (i.e., the supernova SN 1572). This work shows major Ramist influences. Consideration of the orderly majesty of God leads to encyclopedism about the universe and an analogue of a memory system.

Problems of Bodin became attached to some Renaissance editions of Aristotelian &quot;problemata&quot; in natural philosophy. Further, Damian Siffert compiled a &quot;Problemata Bodini&quot;, which was based on the &quot;Theatrum&quot;.

=== &quot;Les Six livres de la République&quot; ===

Jean Bodin&#x27;s best-known work was &quot;The Six Books of the Republic&quot; (), written in 1576. The discussion regarding the best form of government which took place in those years around the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre (1572) gave the inspiration. Bodin&#x27;s, classical, definition of sovereignty is: &quot;&quot; (the absolute and perpetual power of a Republic). His main ideas about sovereignty are found in chapter VIII and X of Book I, including his statement &quot;The sovereign Prince is accountable only to God&quot;.

The &quot;Six livres&quot; were an immediate success and were frequently reprinted. A revised and expanded Latin translation by the author appeared in 1586. With this work, Bodin became one of the founders of the pragmatic inter-confessional group known as the &quot;politiques&quot;, who ultimately succeeded in ending the Wars of Religion under King Henry IV, with the Edict of Nantes (1598). Against the monarchomachs who were assailing kingship in his time, such as Theodore Beza and François Hotman, Bodin succeeded in writing a fundamental and influential treatise of social and political theory. In its reasoning against all types of mixed constitution and resistance theory, it was an effective counter-attack against the monarchomach position invoking &quot;popular sovereignty&quot;.

The structure of the earlier books has been described as Ramist in structure. Book VI contains astrological and numerological reasoning. Bodin invoked Pythagoras in discussing justice and in Book IV used ideas related to the Utopia of Thomas More. The use of language derived from or replacing Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;città&quot; (Latin &quot;civitas&quot;) as political unit (French &quot;cité&quot; or &quot;ville&quot;) is thoughtful; Bodin introduced republic (French &quot;république&quot;, Latin &quot;respublica&quot;) as a term for matters of public law (the contemporary English rendering was &quot;commonweal(th)&quot;). Bodin, although he referred to Tacitus, was not writing here in the tradition of classical republicanism. The Ottoman Empire is analysed as a &quot;seigneurial monarchy&quot;. The Republic of Venice is not accepted in the terms of Gasparo Contarini: it is called an aristocratic constitution, not a mixed one, with a concentric structure, and its apparent stability was not attributable to the form of government.

The ideas in the &quot;Six livres&quot; on the importance of climate in the shaping of a people&#x27;s character were also influential, finding a prominent place in the work of Giovanni Botero (1544–1617) and later in Baron de Montesquieu&#x27;s (1689–1755) climatic determinism. Based on the assumption that a country&#x27;s climate shapes the character of its population, and hence to a large extent the most suitable form of government, Bodin postulated that a hereditary monarchy would be the ideal regime for a temperate nation such as France. This power should be &quot;sovereign&quot;, i.e., not be subject to any other branch, though to some extent limited by institutions like the high courts (&quot;Parlement&quot;) and representative assemblies (&quot;États&quot;). Above all, the monarch is &quot;responsible only to God&quot;, that is, must stand above confessional factions.

The work soon became widely known. Gaspar de Anastro made a Spanish translation in 1590. Richard Knolles put together an English translation (1606); this was based on the 1586 Latin version, but in places follows other versions. It appeared under the title &quot;The Six Bookes of a Common-weale&quot;.

===&quot;De la démonomanie des sorciers&quot; ===
Bodin&#x27;s major work on sorcery and the witchcraft persecutions was &quot;Of the Demon-mania of the Sorcerers&quot; (), first issued in 1580, with ten editions published by 1604. In it he elaborates the influential concept of &quot;pact witchcraft&quot; based on a deal with the Devil and the belief that the evil spirit would use a strategy to impose doubt on judges to look upon magicians as madmen and hypochondriacs deserving of compassion rather than chastisement.

The book relates histories of sorcerers, but does not mention Faust and his pact. It gave a report of a 1552 public exorcism in Paris, and of the case of Magdalena de la Cruz of Cordova, an abbess who had confessed to sexual relations with the Devil over three decades. Bodin cited Pierre Marner on werewolf accounts from Savoie. He denounced the works of Cornelius Agrippa, and the perceived traffic in &quot;sorceries&quot; carried out along the Spanish Road, running along eastern France for much of its length.

He wrote in extreme terms about procedures in sorcery trials, opposing the normal safeguards of justice. This advocacy of relaxation was aimed directly at the existing standards laid down by the Parlement of Paris (physical or written evidence, confessions not obtained by torture, unimpeachable witnesses). He asserted that not even one witch could be erroneously condemned if the correct procedures were followed, because rumours concerning sorcerers were almost always true. Bodin&#x27;s attitude has been called a populationist strategy typical of mercantilism.

The book was influential in the debate over witchcraft; it was translated into German by Johann Fischart (1581), and in the same year into Latin by François Du Jon as &quot;De magorum dæmonomania libri IV&quot;. It was quoted by Jean de Léry, writing about the Tupinamba people of what is now Brazil.

One surviving copy of the text, located in the University of Southern California&#x27;s Special Collections Library, is a rare presentation copy signed by Bodin himself, and is one of only two known surviving texts that feature such an inscription by the author. The USC &quot;Démonomanie&quot; dedication is to a C.L. Varroni, thought to be a legal colleague of Bodin&#x27;s.

==Views==

===Law and politics===
Jean Bodin became well known for his analysis of sovereignty, which he took to be indivisible, and to involve full legislative powers (though with qualifications and caveats). With François Hotman (1524–1590) and François Baudouin (1520–1573), on the other hand, Bodin also supported the force of customary law, seeing Roman law alone as inadequate.

He hedged the absolutist nature of his theory of sovereignty, which was an analytical concept; if later his ideas were used in a different, normative fashion, that was not overtly the reason in Bodin. Sovereignty could be looked at as a &quot;bundle of attributes&quot;; in that light the legislative role took centre stage, and other &quot;marks of sovereignty&quot; could be discussed further, as separate issues. He was a &quot;politique&quot; in theory, which was the moderate position of the period in French politics; but drew the conclusion that only passive resistance to authority was justified.

Bodin&#x27;s work on political theory saw the introduction of the modern concept of &quot;state&quot; but was in the fact on the cusp of usage (with that of Corasius), with the older meaning of a monarch &quot;maintaining his state&quot; not having dropped away. Public office belonged to the commonwealth, and its holders had a personal responsibility for their actions. Politics is autonomous, and the sovereign is subject to divine and natural law, but not to any church; the obligation is to secure justice and religious worship in the state.

Bodin studied the balance of liberty and authority. He had no doctrine of separation of powers and argued in a traditional way about royal prerogative and its proper, limited sphere. His doctrine was one of balance as harmony, with numerous qualifications; as such it could be used in different manners, and was. The key was that the central point of power should be above faction. Rose sees Bodin&#x27;s politics as ultimately theocratic, and misunderstood by the absolutists who followed him.

Where Aristotle argued for six types of state, Bodin allowed only monarchy, aristocracy and democracy. He advocated, however, distinguishing the form of state (constitution) from the form of government (administration). Bodin had a low opinion of democracy.

Families were the basic unit and model for the state; on the other hand John Milton found in Bodin an ally on the topic of divorce. Respect for individual liberty and possessions were the hallmark of the orderly state, a view Bodin shared with Hotman and George Buchanan. He argued against slavery.

In matters of law and politics, Bodin saw religion as a social prop, encouraging respect for law and governance.

===On change and progress===
Bodin praised printing as outshining any achievement of the ancients. The idea that the Protestant Reformation was driven by economic and political forces is attributed to him. He is identified as the first person to realize the rapid rate of change of early modern Europe.

In physics, he is credited as the first modern writer to use the concept of physical laws to define change, but his idea of nature included the action of spirits. In politics, he adhered to the ideas of his time in considering a political revolution in the nature of an astronomical cycle: a &quot;changement&quot; (French) or simply a change (as translated 1606) in English; from Polybius Bodin took the idea of &quot;anacyclosis&quot;, or cyclic change of constitution. Bodin&#x27;s theory was that governments had begun as monarchical, had then been democratic, before becoming aristocratic.

===Religious tolerance===

====Public position====
In 1576, Bodin was engaged in French politics, and then argued against the use of compulsion in matters of religion, if unsuccessfully. Wars, he considered, should be subject to statecraft, and matters of religion did not touch the state.

Bodin argued that a state might contain several religions; this was a very unusual position for his time, if shared by Michel de l&#x27;Hôpital and William the Silent. It was attacked by Pedro de Rivadeneira and Juan de Mariana, from the conventional opposing position of a state obligation to root out religious dissent. He argued in the &quot;Six livres&quot; that the Trial of the Knights Templar was an example of unjustified persecution, similar to that of the Jews and medieval fraternities.

====Private position in the &quot;Colloquium&quot;====
In 1588, Bodin completed in manuscript a Latin work &quot;Colloquium heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis abditis&quot; (Colloquium of the Seven about Secrets of the Sublime). It is a conversation about the nature of truth between seven educated men, each with a distinct religious or philosophical orientation - a natural philosopher, a Calvinist, a Muslim, a Roman Catholic, a Lutheran, a Jew, and a skeptic. Because of this work, Bodin is often identified as one of the first proponents of religious tolerance in the western world. Truth, in Bodin&#x27;s view, commanded universal agreement; and the Abrahamic religions agreed on the Old Testament (Tanakh). &quot;Vera religio&quot; (true religion) would command loyalty to the point of death; his conception of it was influenced by Philo and Maimonides. His views on free will are also bound up with his studies in Jewish philosophy. Some modern scholars have contested his authorship of the text. The &quot;Colloquium of the Seven regarding the hidden secrets of the sublime things&quot; offers a peaceful discussion with seven representatives of various religions and worldviews, who in the end agree on the fundamental underlying similarity of their beliefs.

Bodin&#x27;s theory, as based in considerations of harmony, resembles that of Sebastian Castellio. He has been seen as a scriptural relativist, and deist, with Montaigne and Pierre Charron; also in the group of learned Christian Hebraists with John Selden, Carlo Giuseppe Imbonati, and Gerhard Vossius. By reputation, at least, Bodin was cited as an unbeliever, deist or atheist by Christian writers who associated him with perceived free-thinking and sceptical tradition of Machiavelli and Pietro Pomponazzi, Lucilio Vanini, Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza: Pierre-Daniel Huet, Nathaniel Falck, Claude-François Houtteville. Pierre Bayle attributed to Bodin a maxim about the intellectual consequences of the non-existence of God (a precursor of Voltaire&#x27;s, but based on a traditional commonplace of French thinkers). Wilhelm Dilthey later wrote that the protagonists in the Colloquium anticipate those of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Nathan der Weise&quot;.

The Colloquium was one of the major and most popular manuscripts in clandestine circulation in the early modern period, with more than 100 copies catalogued. it had an extensive covert circulation, after coming into intellectual fashion. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica states &quot;It is curious that Leibniz, who originally regarded the &quot;Colloquium&quot; as the work of a professed enemy of Christianity, subsequently described it as a most valuable production&quot;. Its dissemination increased after 1700, even if its content was by then dated. It was interpreted in the 18th century as containing arguments for natural religion, as if the views expressed by Toralba (the proponent of natural religion) were Bodin&#x27;s; wrongly, according to Rose, whose reconstruction of Bodin&#x27;s religious views is a long way from belief in a detached deity. Grotius had a manuscript. Gottfried Leibniz, who criticized the Colloquium to Jacob Thomasius and Hermann Conring, some years later did editorial work on the manuscript. Henry Oldenburg wanted to copy it, for transmission to John Milton and possibly John Dury, or for some other connection in 1659. In 1662 Conring was seeking a copy for a princely library. It was not to be published in full until 1857, by Ludwig Noack, from manuscripts collected by Heinrich Christian von Seckenberg.

====Personal religious convictions====
Bodin was influenced by philosophic Judaism to believe in the annihilation of the wicked &#x27;post exacta supplicia&#x27;.

19th-century author Eliphas Levi esteemed Bodin as a student of Jewish esoterism: &quot;The Kabalist Bodin who has been considered erroneously of a feeble and superstitious mind, had no other motive in writing his Demonomania than that of warning people against dangerous incredulity. Initiated by the study of the Kabalah into the true secrets of Magic, he trembled at the danger to which society was exposed by the abandonment of this power to the wickedness of men.&quot;

===Cultural and universal history and geography===
Bodin was a polymath, concerned with universal history which he approached as a jurist. He belonged to an identifiable French school of antiquarian and cultural history, with Lancelot Voisin de La Popelinière, Louis Le Caron, Louis Le Roy, Étienne Pasquier and Nicolas Vignier.

Bodin&#x27;s theory of the &quot;Frankish Gauls&quot;, proposing a non-German genealogy for France, was still being reviled by Leibniz in the 18th century. Bodin argued that &quot;frank&quot; actually meant &quot;free&quot; in the Gallic language and, based on Caesar, he said the Gauls had crossed the Rhine to escape the Roman yoke, and so were called Franks, and the country of France derived its name from them (who were originally Gauls). Leon Poliakov discussed this in &quot;The Aryan Myth&quot;:

Etymological speculation and childish word games of this kind have been rife in western history ever since the Fathers of the Church, but it was the humanists of the Renaissance who first utilized them in the service of a new born chauvinism. It may be remarked, furthermore, that Bodin&#x27;s theory attributes to the Frankish Gauls certain virtues which were unknown to the enslaved Gauls.

Historical disciples included Jacques Auguste de Thou and William Camden. The genre thus founded, drawing social conclusions, identified itself as &quot;civil history&quot;, and was influenced particularly by Polybius. The &quot;Methodus&quot; has been called the first book to advance &quot;a theory of universal history based on a purely secular study of the growth of civilisation&quot;. Bodin&#x27;s secular attitude to history therefore goes some way to explain his perceived relationship to Machiavelli. While Bodin&#x27;s common ground with Machiavelli is not so large, and indeed Bodin opposed the Godless vision of the world in Machiavelli, they are often enough paired, for example by A. C. Crombie as philosophical historians with contemporary concerns; Crombie also links Bodin with Francis Bacon, as rational and critical historians. Both Bodin and Machiavelli treat religion as situated historically.

Bodin drew largely on Johann Boemus, and also classical authors, as well as accounts from Leo Africanus and Francisco Álvares. He showed little interest, however, in the New World. In terms of theories of cultural diffusion he influenced Nathanael Carpenter, and many subsequently, with his &quot;south-eastern origin&quot; theory of the transmission from peoples of the Middle East to Greece and Rome (and hence to Northern Europe). Another follower was Peter Heylyn in his &quot;Microcosmus&quot; (1621). In anthropology Bodin showed indications of polygenism as theory of human origins. In clearer terms, on the other hand, he believed that mankind was unifying, the drivers being trade, and the indications of the &quot;respublica mundana&quot; (world commonwealth) and international law as developing. This was within a scheme of &quot;Vaticinium Eliae&quot; or three periods of 2000 years for universal history, to which he had little commitment, though indicating its connection with the three climate regions and their predominance.

The &quot;south-eastern&quot; theory depended for its explanation on Bodin&#x27;s climate theory and astrology: it was given in the &quot;Methodus&quot;, and developed in Book VI of the &quot;Six Livres&quot;. He made an identification of peoples and geographical sectors with planetary influences, in Book V of the &quot;Six Livres&quot;. His astrological theory is combined with the Hippocratic tradition; but not in the conventional way of Ptolemy. It has been suggested that he took them from a follower of Cardano, Auger Ferrier.

==Reception==
Bodin&#x27;s conception of sovereignty was widely adopted in Europe. In a form simplified and adapted by others, such as the French jurists Charles Loyseau (1564–1627) and Cardin Le Bret (1558–1655), it played an important role in the development of absolutism.

===In France===
Influentially, Bodin defended an orderly Gallican monarchy against Huguenots, and any external interference. These general ideas became political orthodoxy, in the reign of Henry IV of France, tending to the beginnings of absolutism. Bodin had numerous followers as political theorist, including Pierre Grégoire, in whom with François Grimaudet legislative authority starts to become closer to the divine right of kings, and William Barclay. Pierre Charron in &quot;La Sagesse&quot; of 1601 uses the idea of state from Bodin but with fewer limitations on royal power; Charron in this work argued for a secular neo-stoicism, putting together ideas of Montaigne and Lipsius with those of Bodin. Charles Loyseau in the years 1608-10 published absolutist works with the emphasis on orderliness in society, going much beyond Bodin&#x27;s writing of thirty years earlier, a trend that continued into the 17th century.

As a demonologist, his work was taken to be authoritative and based on experience as witch-hunting practitioner. As historian, he was prominently cited by Nicolas Lenglet Du Fresnoy in his 1713 &quot;Methode pour etudier l&#x27;Histoire&quot;. Montesquieu read Bodin closely; the modern sociology hinted at in Bodin, arising from the relationship between the state apparatus on the one hand, and society on the other, is developed in Montesquieu.

===In Germany===
Jean Bodin&#x27;s rejection of the Four Monarchies model was unpopular, given the German investment in the Holy Roman Emperor as fourth monarch, the attitude of Johannes Sleidanus. The need to accommodate the existing structure of the Empire with Bodin as theorist of sovereignty led to a controversy running over nearly half a century; starting with Henning Arnisaeus, it continued unresolved to 1626 and the time of Christopher Besoldus. He drew a line under it, by adopting the concept of composite polyarchy, which held sway subsequently. Leibniz rejected Bodin&#x27;s view of sovereignty, stating that it might amount only to territorial control, and the consequence drawn by writers in Bodin&#x27;s tradition that federalism was chimeric.

===In England===
Generally, the English took great interest in the French Wars of Religion; their literature came into commonplace use in English political debate, and Amyas Paulet made immediate efforts to find the &quot;Six livres&quot; for Edward Dyer. Shortly Bodin&#x27;s works were known in England: to Philip Sidney, Walter Ralegh, and to Gabriel Harvey who reported they were fashionable in Oxford. His ideas on inflation were familiar by 1581. Somerville makes the point that not all those who discussed sovereignty in England at this period necessarily took their views from Bodin: the ideas were in the air at the time, and some such as Hadrian à Saravia and Christopher Lever had their own reasoning to similar conclusions. Richard Hooker had access to the works, but doesn&#x27;t reference them. John Donne cited Bodin in his &quot;Biathanatos&quot;.

Bodin&#x27;s view of parallelism of French and English monarchies was accepted by Ralegh. Roger Twysden dissented: in his view, the English monarchy had never fitted Bodin&#x27;s definition of sovereignty. Richard Beacon in &quot;Solon His Follie&quot; (1594), directed towards English colonisation in Ireland, used text derived from the &quot;Six livres&quot;, as well as much theory from Machiavelli; he also argued, against Bodin, that France was a mixed monarchy. Bodin influenced the controversial definitions of John Cowell, in his 1607 book &quot;The Interpreter&quot;, that caused a furore in Parliament during 1610. Edward Coke took from Bodin on sovereignty; and like him opposed the concept of mixed monarchy.

While Bodin&#x27;s ideas on authority fitted with the theory of divine right of kings, his main concern was not with the choice of the sovereign. But that meant they could cut both ways, being cited by parliamentarians as well as royalists. Henry Parker in 1642 asserted the sovereignty of Parliament by Bodinian reasoning. James Whitelocke used Bodin&#x27;s thought in discussing the King-in-Parliament. The royalist Robert Filmer borrowed largely from Bodin for the argument of his &quot;Patriarcha&quot;. John Locke in arguing decades later against Filmer in &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; didn&#x27;t go behind his work to attack Bodin; but his ally James Tyrrell did, as did Algernon Sidney. Another royalist user of Bodin was Michael Hudson. John Milton used Bodin&#x27;s theory in defending his anti-democratic plan for a Grand Council, after Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s death.

Sir John Eliot summarized work of Arnisaeus as critic of Bodin, and wrote in the Tower of London following Bodin that a lawful king, as opposed to a tyrant, &quot;will not do what he may do&quot;, in his &quot;De iure majestatis&quot;. Robert Bruce Cotton quoted Bodin on the value of money; Robert Burton on politics in the &quot;Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;.

Richard Knolles in the introduction to his 1606 translation commended the book as written by a man experienced in public affairs. William Loe complained, in preaching to Parliament in 1621, that Bodin with Lipsius and Machiavelli was too much studied, to the neglect of Scripture. Richard Baxter on the other hand regarded the reading of Bodin, Hugo Grotius and Francisco Suárez as a suitable training in politics, for lawyers.

Bodin&#x27;s views on witchcraft were taken up in England by the witch-hunter Brian Darcy in the early 1580s, who argued for burning rather than hanging as a method of execution, and followed some of Bodin&#x27;s suggestions in interrogating Ursula Kemp. They were also radically opposed by Reginald Scott in his sceptical work &quot;Discoverie of Witchcraft&quot; (1584). Later Francis Hutchinson was his detractor, criticising his methodology.

===In Italy===

In Italy Bodin was seen as a secular historian like Machiavelli. At the time of the Venetian Interdict, Venetians agreed with the legislative definition of sovereignty. In particular Paolo Sarpi argued that Venice&#x27;s limited size in territorial terms was not the relevant point for the actions it could undertake on its own authority.

Later Giambattista Vico was to take Bodin&#x27;s cultural history approach noticeably further.

====The Papacy====
Works of Bodin were soon placed on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; for various reasons, including discussion of Fortune (against free will), and reason of state. The &quot;Methodus&quot; went on the Index in 1590; Robert Bellarmine as censor found it of some merit in its learning, but the author to be a heretic or atheist, critical of the papacy and much too sympathetic to Charles Du Moulin in particular. Other works followed in 1593. All his work was placed on the Index in 1628; the prohibition on the &quot;Theatrum&quot; continued into the 20th century. Venetian theologians were described as followers of Machiavelli and Bodin by Giovanni Amato.

Bellarmine&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus de potestate summi pontificis in temporalibus&quot; reiterated, against Bodin&#x27;s sovereignty theory, an indirect form of the traditional papal deposing power to release subjects from the duty of obedience to tyrants. Jakob Keller, in an apologetical work on behalf of limited justifications for tyrannicide, treated Bodin as a serious opponent on the argument that subjects can only resist a tyrant passively, with views on the Empire that were offensive.

===In Spain===
In 1583, Bodin was placed on the Quiroga Index. Against tyrannicide, Bodin&#x27;s thought was out of step of conventional thinking in Spain at the time. It was recognized, in an unpublished dialogue imagined between Bodin and a jurist of Castile, that the government of Spain was harder than that of France, the other major European power, because of the more complex structure of the kingdom.

Jean Bodin&#x27;s view of witchcraft was hardly known in Spain until the 18th century.

<doc id="272097" wikidata="Q3149586" url="?curid=272097" title="In-band on-channel">
<text>In-band on-channel (IBOC) is a hybrid method of transmitting digital radio and analog radio broadcast signals simultaneously on the same frequency. The name refers to the new digital signals being broadcast in the same AM or FM band (in-band), and associated with an existing radio channel (on-channel). By utilizing additional digital subcarriers or sidebands, digital information is multiplexed on existing signals, thus avoiding re-allocation of the broadcast bands.

IBOC relies on unused areas of the existing spectrum to send its signals. This is particularly useful in North America style FM, where channels are widely spaced at 200 kHz but use only about 50 kHz of that bandwidth for the audio signal. In most countries, FM channel spacing may be as close as 100 kHz, and on AM it is only 10 kHz. While these all offer some room for additional digital broadcasts, most attention on IBOC is in the FM band in North American systems; in Europe and many other countries, entirely new bands were allocated for all-digital systems.

Digital radio standards generally allow multiple program channels to be multiplexed into a single digital stream. In North American FM, this normally allows two or three high-fidelity signals combined in one channel, or one high-fidelity signal plus several additional channels at medium-fidelity levels that are much higher quality than AM. For even greater capacity, some existing subcarriers can be taken off the air to provide additional bandwidth in the modulation baseband. On FM for instance, this might mean removing stereo from the analog signal, relying on the digital signal to provide stereo where desired, thus making room for another digital channel. Due to the reduced bandwidth in AM, IBOC is with analog stereo, although that is rarely implemented, and additional channels are limited to highly compressed voice such as traffic and weather.

Eventually, stations can go from digital/analog-hybrid mode to all-digital, by eliminating the baseband monophonic audio.

==FM methods==
On FM there are three methods of IBOC broadcasting in use, primarily in the United States.

===HD Radio Broadcasting===
The first, and only, digital technology approved for use on AM and FM broadcast frequencies by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, is the proprietary HD Radio system developed by iBiquity Digital Corporation, which transmits energy beyond the allotted ±100 kHz FM channel. This creates potential interference issues with adjacent channels. This is the most widely used system, with approximately 1,560 stations transmitting HD radio in the US, plus over 800 new multicast channels (as of Jan 2010). There is a one-time license fee to iBiquity Digital, for the use of its intellectual property, as well as costs for new equipment which range from $50,000 to $100,000 US (2010) per station.

===FMeXtra===
The other system is FMeXtra by Digital Radio Express, which instead uses subcarriers within the existing signal. This system was introduced more recently. The FMeXtra is compatible with HD Radio in hybrid mode, but not in all-digital mode, and with RBDS. The stereo subcarrier can be removed to make more space available for FMeXtra in the modulation baseband. However, the system is not compatible with other existing 67–92 kHz subcarriers which have mostly fallen into disuse. The system is far less expensive and less complicated to implement, needing only to be plugged into the existing exciter, and requiring no licensing fees. FMeXtra has generally all the user features of HD Radio, including multicast capability, the ability to broadcast several different audio programs simultaneously. It uses the aacPlus (HE-AAC) codec.

FMeXtra can restrict listening with conditional access and encryption.

===DRM===
Digital Radio Mondiale allows for simultaneous transmission of multiple data streams alongside an audio signal. The DRM mode for VHF provides bandwidths from between 35 kbit/s to 185 kbit/s and up to four simultaneous data streams, allowing 5.1 surround DVD quality audio to be broadcast alongside other multimedia content - images, video or HTML content are typical examples.

Like HD Radio, it can be backwards compatible with existing FM receiver equipment receiving the analog signal, with side-band broadcasts digitally encoded using HE-AAC or xHE-AAC received on compatible devices, this ability to operate within the internationally agreed FM spectrum of 88-108 MHz makes DRM a viable candidate for future adoption if countries begin to eliminate their analog broadcasts.

==AM methods==

===HD Radio Broadcasting===
iBiquity also created a mediumwave HD Radio system for AM, which is the only system approved by the Federal Communications Commission for digital AM broadcasting in the United States. The HD Radio system employs use of injected digital sidebands above and below the audible portion of the analog audio on the primary carrier. This system also phase modulates the carrier in quadrature and injects more digital information on this phase-modulated portion of the carrier. It is based on the principle of AM stereo where it puts a digital signal where the C-QUAM system would put the analog stereo decoding information.

===DRM===
Digital Radio Mondiale has had much more success in creating an AM system, and one that could be much less expensive to implement than any proprietary HD Radio system, although it requires new frequency. It is the only one to have been accepted mediumwave but also shortwave (and possibly longwave) by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for use in regions I and III, but not yet in region II, the Americas. The HD Radio system has also been approved by International Telecommunication Union.

===CAM-D===
CAM-D is yet another method, though it is more of an extension of the current system. Developed by AM stereo pioneer Leonard R. Kahn, It encodes the treble on very small digital sidebands which do not cause interference to adjacent channels, and mixes it back with the analog baseband. Unlike the other two, it is not intended to be capable of multichannel, opting for quality over quantity. Unlike the HD system iBiquity calls &quot;hybrid digital&quot; the CAM-D system truly is a direct hybrid of both analog and digital. Some engineers believe that CAM-D may be compatible with analog AM stereo with the right engineering.

Critics of CAM-D point to several drawbacks:
#being primarily analog, the system will be just as subject to artificial interference and noise as the current AM system
#there are virtually no receivers available for the system and at present, no major manufacturer has announced even the intention to begin production of them; and
#the cost of retrofitting with CAM-D is more than that of simply buying a new, HD-ready solid state transmitter.

== IBOC Versus DAB ==

While the United Kingdom and many other countries have chosen the Eureka 147 standard of digital audio broadcasting (DAB) for creating a digital radio service, the United States has selected IBOC technology for its digital AM and FM stations. The band commonly used for terrestrial DAB is part of VHF band III, which does not suffer from L-band&#x27;s significant line-of-sight problems. However, it is not available in North America since that span is occupied by TV channels 7 to 13 and the amateur radio 1.25 meter (222 MHz) band. The stations currently occupying that spectrum did not wish to give up their space, since VHF offers several benefits over UHF: relatively lower power, long distance propagation (up to 100 miles (160 km) with a rooftop antenna), and a longer wavelength that is more robust and less affected by interference. In Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) is continuing to follow the analog standard, so the channels remain unavailable there as well. HD Radio testing has been authorized in Canada, as well as other countries around the world.

There was also concern that AM and FM stations&#x27; branding, using their current frequencies, would be lost to new channel numbers, though virtual channels such as on digital television would eliminate this. Also, several competing stations would have to share a transmitter that multiplexes them all into one ensemble with the same coverage area (though many FM stations are already diplexed in large cities such as New York). A further concern to FM station operators was that AM stations could suddenly be in competition with the same high audio quality, although FM would still have the advantage of higher data rates (300 kbit/s versus 60 kbit/s in the HD Radio standard) due to greater bandwidth (100 kHz versus 10 kHz).

The most significant advantage for IBOC is its relative ease of implementation. Existing analog radios are not rendered obsolete and the consumer and industry may transition to digital at a rational pace. In addition, the technology infrastructure is in place: most major broadcast equipment manufacturers are implementing IBOC technology and 60+ receiver manufacturers are selling IBOC reception devices. In the UK, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland, which are the leading countries with regard to implementing DAB, the first-generation MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (MP2) codec stereo radio stations on DAB have a lower sound-quality than FM, prompting a number of complaints. The typical bandwidth for DAB programs is only 128 kbit/s using the first generation CODEC, the less-robust MP2 standard which requires at least &quot;double&quot; that rate to be considered near-CD quality.

An updated version of the Eureka-147 standard called DAB+ has been implemented. Using the more efficient high quality MPEG-4 CODEC HE-AAC v2, this compression method allows the DAB+ system to carry more channels or have better sound quality at the same bit rate as the original DAB system. It is the DAB+ implementation which will be under consideration for new station designs and not the earlier DAB scheme using the MUSICAM CODEC. The DAB+ system was coordinated and developed by the World DAB Forum, formed in 1997 from the old organization. It gives the Eureka-147 system a similar quality per bit rate as the IBOC system and hence (arguably) a better sound quality than FM.

==Challenges==
AM IBOC in the United States still faces some serious technological challenges, including nighttime interference with other stations. iBiquity initially used an audio compression system known as PAC (also used at a higher bitrate in Sirius satellite radio, see Digital Audio Radio Service), but in August 2003 a switch to HDC (based-upon ACC) was made to rectify these problems. HDC has been customized for IBOC, and it is also likely that the patent rights and royalties for every transmitter and receiver can be retained longer by creating a more proprietary system. Digital Radio Mondiale is also developing an IBOC system, likely to be used worldwide with AM shortwave radio, and possibly with broadcast AM and FM. Neither of those have been approved yet for ITU region 2 (the Americas). 

Both AM and FM IBOC signals cause interference to adjacent-channel stations, but not within the station&#x27;s interference-free protected contours designated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). It has led to derogatory terms such as IBAC (In-band adjacent-channel) and IBUZ (since the interference sounds like a buzz.) The range of a station on an HD Radio receiver is somewhat less than its analog signal. In June 2008, a group of US broadcasters and equipment manufacturers requested that the U.S. FCC increase the permissible FM IBOC power from 1% (currently) to a maximum of 10% of the analog power. On January 29, 2010, the FCC approved the request. In addition, tropospheric ducting and e-skip can reduce the range of the digital signal, as well as the analog.

IBOC digital radios using iBiquity&#x27;s standard are being marketed under the brand &quot;HD Radio&quot; to highlight the purported quality of reception. As of June 2008, over 60 different receiver models have been made, and stations have received blanket (no longer individual and experimental) authorization from the U.S. FCC to transmit in a multiplexed multichannel mode on FM. Originally, the use of HD Radio transmission on AM was limited to daytime only, and not allowed at night due to potential problems with skywave radio propagation. The FCC lifted this restriction in early 2007. DRM, however, is being used across Europe on shortwave, which is entirely AM skywave, without issue. With the proper receiver, many of those stations can be heard in North America as well, sans the analog signal.

==IBOC around the world==

=== Argentina ===
HD Radio technology was tested in 2004 with initial trials in Buenos Aires. Further testing of the technology began in early 2007.

=== Bangladesh ===
Government broadcaster BETAR began broadcasting HD Radio on their 100.0 MHz frequency on 9 November 2016 from their Agargaon site in Dhaka. The transmission uses a 10 kW GatesAir system. The 100.0 MHz carries programs from BBC World Service amongst others. HD 1, 2, 3 and 4 are configured. A second transmission will also have HD radio added on 88.8 MHz from the same site.

=== Bosnia ===
Trial and tests of HD Radio technology began in Sarajevo in March 2007.

=== Brazil ===
HD Radio and DRM trials in Brazil started in the mid 2000s. No regular HD Radio or DRM transmissions are allowed in Brazil as the digital radio standard in that country is not yet defined. One or two year experimental licenses were given to some Broadcasters. A joint study by the government (Ministry of Communications and ANATEL) and the National Metrology Institute (Inmetro) was done and the Digital Radio Consultative Council concluded that HD Radio and DRM do not meet the same analog transmission coverage with 20db less power. New trials are expected to occur before any decision about the Brazilian Digital Radio standard. Brazil is considering for adoption Digital Radio Mondiale or HD Radio.

=== Canada ===
After having L-band DAB for several years, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) have also looked at the use of HD Radio, given its gradual progress in the neighbouring U.S. The CBC began HD Radio testing in September 2006, focusing on transmissions from Toronto and Peterborough, Ontario.

The CRTC has since revised its policy on digital radio to allow HD Radio operations. Use of HD Radio is now widespread in dense urban markets like Toronto, Vancouver and Ottawa, with some use on the AM band as well.

=== Czech Republic ===
Initial testing of the HD Radio system commenced in Prague in February 2007.

=== China ===
In China, Hunan Broadcasting Company started FMeXtra transmissions in Changsha in April 2007, and plans to put others throughout the Hunan province. SARFT (State Administration for Radio, Film and Television) is currently testing HD Radio in Beijing in contemplation for acceptance in that country.

=== Colombia ===
Caracol Radio began testing of the HD Radio technology in both the AM and FM bands in early 2008.

=== El Salvador ===
El Salvador will be choosing HD Radio as its digital radio standard.

=== Europe ===
In September 2007 the European HD Radio Alliance (EHDRA) was formed by broadcasters and other interested groups to promote the adoption of HD Radio technology by European broadcasters, regulators and standards organizations.

=== France ===
France began broadcasting an HD Radio signal in March 2006 and plans to multicast two or more channels. The radio stations that use IBOC HD in France are SIRTI and NRJ Group. The owner of the transmitter is Towercast. The frequency of IBOC HD radio is 88.2 MHz. In May 2006, The Towercast group added a single channel of digital audio on 93.9 MHz.

=== Germany ===
Radio Regenbogen began HD Radio operations on 102.8 MHz in Heidelberg on December 3, 2007 pursuant to government testing authority.

=== Indonesia ===
Forum Radio Jaringan Indonesia had tested IBOC HD transmission from March 2006 to May 2006. The IBOC HD station in Jakarta was Delta FM (99.1 MHz). In April 2006, Radio Sangkakala (in Surabaya), the first AM HD radio station in Asia, went on the air on 1062 kHz.

=== Jamaica ===
Radio Jamaica began operating full-time with both HD Radio AM and FM signals in the city of Kingston in 2008.

=== Mexico ===
All Mexican radio stations within 320 km of the U.S. border are allowed to transmit their programs on the AM and FM bands utilizing HD Radio technology. Approximately six Mexican AM and FM stations are already operating with HD Radio technology along Mexico’s border area with the US. Grupo Imagen commenced HD Radio transmissions on XHDL-FM and XEDA-FM as well as Instituto Mexicano de la Radio on XHIMR-FM, XHIMER-FM and XHOF-FM in Mexico City in June 2012.

=== New Zealand ===
HD Radio transmission in Auckland, New Zealand was started on October 19, 2005. The frequency of IBOC HD radio is 106.1 MHz. The transmitter is located at Skytower. Following successful testing, the Radio Broadcasters Association (RBA) initiated a comprehensive trial of HD Radio technology in December 2006. The aim of the trial was to assess the coverage potential of the HD Radio system and to make a recommendation on the suitability of the technology for adoption.

=== Philippines ===
The first HD Radio station in the Philippines began broadcasting on November 9, 2005. The Philippines National Telecommunications Commission finalized its rules for FM digital radio operations on November 11, 2007.

=== Poland ===
An HD Radio trial began in Warsaw in 2006 in order to demonstrate the technology to local radio stations.

=== Puerto Rico ===
WPRM FM is the first station in San Juan, Puerto Rico (part of the US) to adopt HD Radio, in April 2005. WRTU in San Juan has also commenced broadcasting in HD Radio technology in 2007.

=== Switzerland ===
FM testing sponsored by Radio Sunshine and Ruoss AG began in Lucerne in April 2006. HD Radio operations in Switzerland continue and are spotlighted each year during “HD Radio Days”, an annual gathering in Lucerne of European broadcasters and manufacturers for the purpose of discussing the rollout of the technology in Europe.

Radio Sunshine has now switched to DAB+ 
due to the high penetration of DAB+ and lack of interest in HD Radio.
DAB+ penetration in Switzerland has now reached 99.5% as of 2018.

=== Thailand ===

HD Radio transmission in Thailand was started in April 2006. Radio of Thailand had created a public IBOC HD radio network targeting mass transit commuters in Thailand&#x27;s capital of Bangkok. To receive the broadcasts, more than 10,000 HD Radio receivers were installed in buses.

=== Ukraine ===

The first FM HD Radio broadcasts in Kyiv went on the air in October 2006 on two FM stations operated by the First Ukrainian Radio Group.

=== Vietnam ===

Voice of Vietnam (VOV) commenced AM and FM HD Radio transmissions in Hanoi in June, 2008 including multicasting, in anticipation of making HD Radio technology a standard.

=== United States ===
As of June 2008, more than 1,700 HD Radio stations were broadcasting 2,432 HD Radio channels. HD Radio technology is the only digital technology approved by the FCC for digital AM and FM broadcasting in the US. Over 60 different HD Radio receivers are on sale in over 12,000 stores nationwide, including Apple, Best Buy, Target, and Wal-Mart. 

As of May 2007, FMeXtra is on several dozen stations. Several hundred stations belonging to the Idea Bank consortium will also have FMeXtra installed.
