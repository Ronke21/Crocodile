<text>The Third Way is a predominantly centrist political position that attempts to reconcile centre-right and centre-left politics by synthesising a combination of economically liberal and social democratic economic policies. 

The Third Way is a reconceptualization of social democracy. It supports workfare instead of welfare, work training programs, educational opportunities, and other government programs that give citizens a &#x27;hand-up&#x27; instead of a &#x27;hand-out&#x27;. The Third Way seeks a compromise between a less interventionist economic system as supported by neoliberals and Keynesian Social democratic spending policy supported by social democrats and progressives.

The Third Way was born from a reevaluation of political policies within various centre to centre-left progressive movements in the 1980s in response to doubt regarding the economic viability of the state and the perceived overuse of economic interventionist policies that had previously been popularised by Keynesianism, but which at that time contrasted with the rise of popularity for neoliberalism and the New Right starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s.

The Third Way has been promoted by social liberal and social-democratic parties. In the United States, a leading proponent of the Third Way was Bill Clinton, who served as the country&#x27;s president from 1993 to 2001. In the United Kingdom, Third Way social-democratic proponent Tony Blair claimed that the socialism he advocated was different from traditional conceptions of socialism and said: &quot;My kind of socialism is a set of values based around notions of social justice. ... Socialism as a rigid form of economic determinism has ended, and rightly.&quot; Blair referred to it as a &quot;social-ism&quot; involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent and advocated social justice, social cohesion, equal worth of each citizen and equal opportunity.

Third Way social-democratic interpreter Anthony Giddens has said that the Third Way rejects the state socialist conception of socialism and instead accepts the conception of socialism as conceived of by Anthony Crosland as an ethical doctrine that views social democratic governments as having achieved a viable ethical socialism by removing the unjust elements of capitalism by providing social welfare and other policies and that contemporary socialism has outgrown the Marxist claim for the need of the abolition of capitalism as a mode of production. In 2009, Blair publicly declared support for a &quot;new capitalism&quot;.

Policies supported by self-described Third Way supporters vary by region, political circumstances, and ideological leanings. Third Way advocates generally support public-private partnerships, a commitment to fiscal conservatism, combining equality of opportunity with personal responsibility, improving human and social capital, and protection of the environment. But even in pursuit of these ends, Third Way advocates differ in their policies, owing to conflicting priorities. Anthony Giddens, for example – believing that society should be more inclusive to the elderly – called for abolishing the retirement age so people could exit the workforce whenever they have saved enough; Emmanuel Macron did the exact opposite, raising the retirement age to balance the budget. The Bill Clinton administration, influenced by the works of the controversial political scientist Charles Murray, was less friendly to the welfare state than Tony Blair.

The Third Way has been criticised by other social democrats, as well as anarchists, communists, and in particular democratic socialists as a betrayal of left-wing values, with some analysts characterising the Third Way as an effectively neoliberal movement. It has also been criticised by conservatives, classical liberals, and libertarians who advocate for &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism.

== Overview ==
=== Origins ===
As a term, the &quot;third way&quot; has been used to explain a variety of political courses and ideologies in the last few centuries. These ideas were implemented by progressives in the early 20th century. The term was picked up again in the 1950s by German ordoliberal economists such as Wilhelm Röpke, resulting in the development of the concept of the social market economy. Röpke later distanced himself from the term and located the social market economy as first way in the sense of an advancement of the free-market economy.

During the Prague Spring of 1968, reform economist Ota Šik proposed third way economic reform as part of political liberalisation and democratisation within the country. In historical context, such proposals were better described as liberalised centrally-planned economy rather than the socially-sensitive capitalism that Third Way policies tend to have been identified with in the West. In the 1970s and 1980s, Enrico Berlinguer, leader of the Italian Communist Party, came to advocate a vision of a socialist society that was more pluralist than the real socialism which was typically advocated by official communist parties whilst being more economically egalitarian than social democracy. This was part of the wider trend of Eurocommunism in the communist movement and provided a theoretical basis for Berlinguer&#x27;s pursuit of the Historic Compromise with the Christian Democrats.

=== Modern usage ===
Third Way politics is visible in Anthony Giddens&#x27; works such as &quot;Consequences of Modernity&quot; (1990), &quot;Modernity and Self-Identity&quot; (1991), &quot;The Transformation of Intimacy&quot; (1992), &quot;Beyond Left and Right&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Third Way: The Renewal of Social Democracy&quot; (1998). In &quot;Beyond Left and Right&quot;, Giddens criticises market socialism and constructs a six-point framework for a reconstituted radical politics that includes the following values:
# Repair damaged solidarities.
# Recognise the centrality of life politics.
# Accept that active trust implies generative politics.
# Embrace dialogic democracy.
# Rethink the welfare state.
# Confront violence.

In &quot;The Third Way&quot;, Giddens provides the framework within which the Third Way, also termed by Giddens as the &quot;radical centre&quot;, is justified. In addition, it supplies a broad range of policy proposals aimed at what Giddens calls the &quot;progressive centre-left&quot; in British politics.

Bill Clinton espoused the ideas of the Third Way during his 1992 presidential campaign.

The Third Way has been defined as such: [S]omething different and distinct from liberal capitalism with its unswerving belief in the merits of the free market and democratic socialism with its demand management and obsession with the state. The Third Way is in favour of growth, entrepreneurship, enterprise and wealth creation but it is also in favour of greater social justice and it sees the state playing a major role in bringing this about. So in the words of ... Anthony Giddens of the LSE the Third Way rejects top down socialism as it rejects traditional neo liberalism.

The Third Way has been advocated by its proponents as a &quot;radical-centrist&quot; alternative to both capitalism and what it regards as the traditional forms of socialism, including Marxian and state socialism. It advocates ethical socialism, reformism and gradualism that includes advocating the humanisation of capitalism, a mixed economy, political pluralism and liberal democracy.

The Third Way has been often hard to holistically summarize, partly due to its flexible nature of putting ends before means, that is prioritizing achieving social justice rather than focusing on the methods by which one achieves social justice. Often cited as the easiest summary of the Third Way is &#x27;rights with responsibilities&#x27;—for example, pairing the right to education with the responsibility to put effort towards achieving good grades. On economics specifically, a great deal of emphasize of the Third Way is placed on tax revenue, and the means by which it is generated. The Third Way argues that wealth must be enticed in a globalized economy, and that any capital flight caused by high taxes is counterproductive to generating tax revenue, for future tax revenue will be lost. The Third Way argues that growth is the best way to raise tax revenue, and that growth can be achieved through a free market economy, fiscal discipline and a healthy human capital stock.

=== Within social democracy ===
The Third Way has been advocated by proponents as competition socialism, an ideology in between traditional socialism and capitalism. Anthony Giddens, a prominent proponent of the Third Way, has publicly endorsed a modernized form of socialism within the social democracy movement. However, he argues that traditional socialist ideology, specifically referring to state socialism involving economic management and planning, is flawed. Giddens asserts that as a theory of the managed economy, it barely exists any longer.

In defining the Third Way, Tony Blair once wrote: &quot;The Third Way stands for a modernised social democracy, passionate in its commitment to social justice&quot;.

== History ==

=== Australia ===

Under the centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 1983 to 1996, the Bob Hawke and Paul Keating governments pursued many economic policies associated with economic rationalism such as floating the Australian Dollar in 1983, reductions in trade tariffs, taxation reforms, changing from centralised wage-fixing to enterprise bargaining, restrictions on trade union activities including on strike action and pattern bargaining, the privatisation of government-run services and enterprises such as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and wholesale deregulation of the banking system. Keating also proposed a Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 1985, but this was scrapped due to its unpopularity amongst both ALP and electorate. The party also desisted from other reforms such as wholesale labour market deregulation, the eventual GST, the privatisation of Telstra and welfare reform. The Hawke-Keating governments have been considered by some as laying the groundwork for the later development of both the New Democrats in the United States and New Labour in the United Kingdom. One political commentator agreed that it led centre-left parties towards the path to neoliberalism. Meanwhile, others, particularly former Labor MP and current National President Wayne Swan, acknowledge several economically conservative reforms, but at the same time disagreed and focused on the prosperity and social equality that they provided in the &quot;26 years of uninterrupted economic growth since 1991&quot;, seeing it as fitting well within &quot;Australian Laborism&quot;. Swan also mentioned the fact that the policies and reforms of the Hawke–Keating governments, described as Third Way, predated the idea by a decade or more.

Both Hawke and Keating made some criticism too. In the lead-up to the 2019 federal election, Hawke made a joint statement with Keating endorsing Labor&#x27;s economic plan and condemned the Liberal Party for &quot;completely [giving] up the economic reform agenda&quot;. They stated that &quot;[Bill] Shorten&#x27;s Labor is the only party of government focused on the need to modernise the economy to deal with the major challenge of our time: human induced climate change&quot;.

Various ideological beliefs were factionalised under reforms to the ALP under Gough Whitlam, resulting in what is now known as the Labor Left, who tend to favour a more interventionist economic policy, more authoritative top-down controls and some socially progressive ideals; and Labor Right, the now dominant faction that is pro-business, more economically liberal and in some cases, more socially conservative.

Former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd&#x27;s first speech to parliament in 1998 stated: Competitive markets are massive and generally efficient generators of economic wealth. They must therefore have a central place in the management of the economy. But markets sometimes fail, requiring direct government intervention through instruments such as industry policy. There are also areas where the public good dictates that there should be no market at all. We are not afraid of a vision in the Labor Party, but nor are we afraid of doing the hard policy yards necessary to turn that vision into reality. Parties of the Centre Left around the world are wrestling with a similar challenge—the creation of a competitive economy while advancing the overriding imperative of a just society. Some call this the &quot;third way&quot;. The nomenclature is unimportant. What is important is that it is a repudiation of Thatcherism and its Australian derivatives represented opposite. It is in fact a new formulation of the nation&#x27;s economic and social imperatives.

While critical of economists such as Friedrich Hayek, Rudd described himself as &quot;basically a conservative when it comes to questions of public financial management&quot;, pointing to his slashing of public service jobs as a Queensland governmental advisor. Rudd&#x27;s government has been praised and credited &quot;by most economists, both local and international, for helping Australia avoiding a post-global-financial-crisis recession&quot; during the Global Recession.

=== Brazil ===

Examples of Brazilian Third Way politicians include current Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Other politicians include Simone Tebet, José Serra, and to a lesser extent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Ciro Gomes.

=== France ===

Examples of French Third Way politicians include current President Emmanuel Macron, and to a lesser extent François Hollande, Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Manuel Valls.

=== Germany ===
Former German chancellor Gerhard Schroder (1998–2005) was a proponent of Third Way policies. Throughout his campaign for chancellor, he portrayed himself as a pragmatic &quot;new&quot; Social Democrat who would promote economic growth while strengthening Germany&#x27;s generous social welfare system. During Schröder&#x27;s time in office, economic growth slowed to only 0.2% in 2002 and Gross Domestic Product shrank in 2003, while German unemployment was over the 10% mark. Most voters soon associated Schröder with the Agenda 2010 reform program, which included cuts in the social welfare system (national health insurance, unemployment payments, pensions), lower taxes, and reformed regulations on employment and payment. He also eliminated capital gains tax on the sale of corporate stocks and thereby made the country more attractive to foreign investors.

Incumbent German chancellor Olaf Scholz (2021–present) has not explicitly stated support for Third way policies, but is widely seen as part of the moderate wing of within the SPD. During his tenure as minister of finance in the Fourth Merkel cabinet (2018–2021), Scholz prioritized not taking on new government debt and limiting public spending.

=== Italy ===

The Italian Democratic Party is a plural social democratic party including several distinct ideological trends. Politicians such as former Prime Ministers Romano Prodi and Matteo Renzi are proponents of the Third Way. Renzi has occasionally been compared to former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for his political views. Renzi himself has previously claimed to be a supporter of Blair&#x27;s ideology of the Third Way, regarding an objective to synthesise liberal economics and left-wing social policies.

Under Renzi&#x27;s secretariat, the Democratic Party took a strong stance in favour of constitutional reform and of a new electoral law on the road toward a two-party system. It is not an easy task to find the exact political trend represented by Renzi and his supporters, who have been known as &quot;Renziani&quot;. The nature of Renzi&#x27;s progressivism is a matter of debate and has been linked both to liberalism and populism. According to Maria Teresa Meli of &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, Renzi &quot;pursues a precise model, borrowed from the Labour Party and Bill Clinton&#x27;s Democratic Party&quot;, comprising &quot;a strange mix (for Italy) of liberal policy in the economic sphere and populism. This means that on one side he will attack the privileges of trade unions, especially of the CGIL, which defends only the already protected, while on the other he will sharply attack the vested powers, bankers, Confindustria and a certain type of capitalism&quot;.

After the Democratic Party&#x27;s defeat in the 2018 general election in which the party gained 18.8% and 19.1% of the vote (down from 25.5% and 27.4% in 2013) and lost 185 deputies and 58 senators, respectively, Renzi resigned as the party&#x27;s secretary. In March 2019, Nicola Zingaretti, a social democrat and prominent member of the party&#x27;s left-wing with solid roots in the Italian Communist Party, won the leadership election by a landslide, defeating Maurizio Martina (Renzi&#x27;s former deputy secretary) and Roberto Giachetti (supported by most &quot;Renziani&quot;). Zingaretti focused his campaign on a clear contrast with Renzi&#x27;s policies and his victory opened the way for a new party.

In September 2019, Renzi announced his intention to leave the Democratic Party and create a new parliamentary group. He officially launched Italia Viva to continue the liberal and Third Way tradition within a pro-Europeanism framework, especially as represented by the French President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s La République En Marche!.

=== United Kingdom ===

In 1939, Harold Macmillan wrote a book entitled &quot;The Middle Way&quot;, advocating a compromise between capitalism and socialism which was a precursor to the contemporary notion of the Third Way.

In 1979, the Labour Party professed a complete adherence to social democratic ideals and rejected the choice between a &quot;prosperous and efficient Britain&quot; and a &quot;caring and compassionate Britain&quot;. Coherent with this position, the main commitment of the party was the reduction of economic inequality via the introduction of a wealth tax. This was rejected in the 1997 manifesto, along with many changes in the 1990s like the progressive dismissal of traditional social democratic ideology and the transformation into New Labour, de-emphasising the need to tackle economic inequality and focusing instead on the expansion of opportunities for all whilst fostering social capital.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair is cited as a Third Way politician. According to a former member of Blair&#x27;s staff, Blair and the Labour Party learnt from and owes a debt to Bob Hawke&#x27;s government in Australia in the 1980s on how to govern as a Third Way party. Blair wrote in a Fabian pamphlet in 1994 of the existence of two prominent variants of socialism, namely one based on a Marxist–Leninist economic determinist and collectivist tradition and the other being an ethical socialism based on values of &quot;social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community&quot;. Blair is a particular follower of the ideas and writings of Giddens.
In 1998, Blair, then Labour Party Leader and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, described the Third Way, how it relates to social democracy and its relation with both the Old Left and the New Right, as follows:
In 2002, Anthony Giddens listed problems facing the New Labour government, naming spin as the biggest failure because its damage to the party&#x27;s image was difficult to rebound from. He also challenged the failure of the Millennium Dome project and Labour&#x27;s inability to deal with irresponsible businesses. Giddens saw Labour&#x27;s ability to marginalise the Conservative Party as a success as well its economic policy, welfare reform and certain aspects of education. Giddens criticised what he called Labour&#x27;s &quot;half-way houses&quot;, including the National Health Service and environmental and constitutional reform.

In 2008, Charles Clarke, a former United Kingdom Home Secretary and the first senior Blairite to attack Prime Minister Gordon Brown openly and in print, stated: &quot;We should discard the techniques of &#x27;triangulation&#x27; and &#x27;dividing lines&#x27; with the Conservatives, which lead to the not entirely unjustified charge that we simply follow proposals from the Conservatives or the right-wing media, to minimise differences and remove lines of attack against us&quot;.

Brown was succeeded by Ed Miliband&#x27;s One Nation Labour in 2010 and self-described democratic socialist Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 as the Leader of the Labour Party. This led some to comment that New Labour is &quot;dead and buried&quot;. Keir Starmer, now the Prime Minister, succeeded Corbyn in 2020, and has since reverted on his initial more left-wing pledges, in favour policies more associated with New Labour.

The Third Way as practised under New Labour has been criticised as being effectively a new, centre-right and neoliberal party. Some such as Glen O&#x27;Hara have argued that while containing &quot;elements that we could term neoliberal&quot;, New Labour was more left-leaning than it is given credit for.

=== United States ===
In the United States, Third Way adherents historically embraced fiscal conservatism to a greater extent than traditional economic liberals, advocated for some replacement of welfare with workfare, and sometimes held a stronger preference for market solutions to traditional problems (as in pollution markets) while rejecting pure &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics and other libertarian positions. The Third Way style of governing was firmly adopted and partly redefined during the administration of President Bill Clinton.

As a term, it was introduced by political scientist Stephen Skowronek. Third Way presidents &quot;undermine the opposition by borrowing policies from it in an effort to seize the middle and with it to achieve political dominance&quot;. Examples of this are Richard Nixon&#x27;s economic policies, which were a continuation of Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Great Society, as well as Clinton&#x27;s welfare reform later.

Along with Blair, Prodi, Gerhard Schröder and other leading Third Way adherents, Clinton organised conferences to promote the Third Way philosophy in 1997 at Chequers in England. The Third Way think tank and the Democratic Leadership Council are adherents of Third Way politics.

In 2013, American lawyer and former bank regulator William K. Black criticized then-extant Third Way movements: &quot;Third Way is this group that pretends sometimes to be centre-left but is actually completely a creation of Wall Street—it&#x27;s run by Wall Street for Wall Street with this false flag operation as if it were a center-left group. It&#x27;s nothing of the sort&quot;.

==Recent developments==
By the 2010s, social democratic parties that accepted Third Way politics such as triangulation and the neoliberal shift in policies such as austerity, deregulation, free trade, privatisation and welfare reforms such as workfare experienced a drastic decline as the Third Way had largely fallen out of favour in a phenomenon known as Pasokification. Scholars have linked the decline of social democratic parties to the declining number of industrial workers, greater economic prosperity of voters and a tendency for these parties to shift closer to the centre-right on economic issues, alienating their former base of supporters and voters. This decline has been matched by increased support for more left-wing and populist parties as well as Left and Green social-democratic parties that rejected neoliberal and Third Way policies.

Democratic socialism has emerged in opposition to Third Way social democracy on the basis that democratic socialists are committed to systemic transformation of the economy from capitalism to socialism whereas social-democratic supporters of the Third Way were more concerned about challenging the New Right and win social democracy back to power. This has resulted in analysts and critics alike arguing that in effect it endorsed capitalism, even if it was due to recognising that outspoken opposition to capitalism in these circumstances was politically nonviable; and that it was anti-social democratic in practice. Others saw it as theoretically fitting with modern socialism, especially liberal socialism, distinguishing it from both classical socialism and traditional democratic socialism or social democracy.

Third Way economic policies began to be challenged following the Great Recession, and the rise of right-wing populism has put the ideology into question. Many on the left have become more vocal in opposition to the Third Way, with the most prominent example in the United Kingdom being the rise of self-identified democratic socialist former Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn as well as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders in the United States.

== Criticism ==
The Third Way has been criticized as being a vague ideology with no specific commitments:
The Third Way is no more than a crude attempt to construct a bogus coalition between the haves and the haves not: Bogus because it entices the haves by assuring them that the economy will be sound and their interests would not be threatened, while promising the have-nots a world free from poverty and injustice. Based on opportunism, it has no ideological commitment at all.

After the dismantling of his country&#x27;s Marxist–Leninist government, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s conservative finance minister Václav Klaus declared in 1990: &quot;We want a market economy without any adjectives. Any compromises with that will only fuzzy up the problems we have. To pursue a so-called &#x27;third way&#x27; [between central planning and the market economy] is foolish. We had our experience with this in the 1960s when we looked for a socialism with a human face. It did not work, and we must be explicit that we are not aiming for a more efficient version of a system that has failed. The market is indivisible; it cannot be an instrument in the hands of central planners&quot;.

Left-wing opponents of the Third Way argue that it represents social democrats who responded to the New Right by accepting capitalism. The Third Way most commonly uses market mechanics and private ownership of the means of production and in that sense it is fundamentally capitalist. In addition to opponents who have noticed this, other reviews have claimed that Third Way social democrats adjusted to the political climate since the 1980s that favoured capitalism by recognising that outspoken opposition to capitalism in these circumstances was politically nonviable and that accepting capitalism as the current status quo and seeking to administer it to challenge &quot;laissez-faire&quot; liberals was a more pressing immediate concern. With the rise of neoliberalism in the late 1970s and early 1980s and the Third Way between the 1990s and 2000s, social democracy became synonymous with it. As a result, the section of social democracy that remained committed to the gradual abolition of capitalism and opposed the Third Way merged into democratic socialism. Many social democrats opposed to the Third Way overlap with democratic socialists in their committiment to an alternative to capitalism and a post-capitalist economy and have not only criticised the Third Way as anti-socialist and neoliberal, but also as anti-social-democratic in practice.

Democratic and market socialists argue that the major reason for the economic shortcomings of command economies was their authoritarian nature rather than socialism itself, that it was a failure of a specific model and that therefore socialists should support democratic models rather than abandon it. Economists Pranab Bardhan and John Roemer argue that Soviet-type economies and Marxist–Leninist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of state enterprises in their administrative, command allocation of resources and commodities and the lack of democracy in the political systems that the Soviet-type economies were combined with. According to them, a form of competitive socialism that rejects dictatorship and authoritarian allocation in favor of democracy could work and prove superior to the market economy.

Although close to New Labour and a key figure in the development of the Third Way, sociologist Anthony Giddens dissociated himself from many of the interpretations of the Third Way made in the sphere of day-to-day politics. For him, it was not a succumbing to neoliberalism or the dominance of capitalist markets. The point was to get beyond both market fundamentalism and top-down socialism—to make the values of the centre-left count in a globalising world. He argued that &quot;the regulation of financial markets is the single most pressing issue in the world economy&quot; and that &quot;global commitment to free trade depends upon effective regulation rather than dispenses with the need for it&quot;.

<doc id="292276" wikidata="Q1680558" url="?curid=292276" title="James Hewitt">
<text>James Lifford Hewitt (born 30 April 1958) is a former cavalry officer in the British Army. He came to public attention in the mid-1990s after he disclosed an affair with Diana, Princess of Wales, while she was still married to then-Prince Charles.

== Early life ==
Hewitt was born in Derry, Northern Ireland, where his father, 1952 Olympic pentathlete John Hewitt, was stationed with the Royal Marines. He grew up in Kent and Devon. His mother, Shirley Stamp, was daughter of a London dental surgeon who lived in Devon. Hewitt was educated at Norwood Preparatory School in Exeter before going to Millfield, a public school, in Street, Somerset.

== Career ==
=== Military ===
After graduating from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Hewitt was commissioned into the Life Guards, British Army, on 8 April 1978 as a second lieutenant. He was promoted to lieutenant on 8 April 1980. He transferred from a short service commission to a special regular commission on 1 October 1981. He was promoted to acting captain on 8 October 1984. On 21 October 1985, he transferred from a special regular commission to a regular commission. In 1991, he served as a Challenger tank squadron commander in the Gulf War. He was mentioned in despatches &quot;in recognition of service during the operation in the Gulf&quot; in June 1991. He failed the exam for promotion to major three times.

On 1 March 1994, he was retired from the British Army after 17 years of military service. The BBC reported in 2003 that in retirement, Hewitt was granted the rank of major which was &quot;in line with common army practice&quot;.

=== Business and media career ===
Hewitt opened a golf driving range in 1994.

He won the Channel 5 reality show &quot;Back to Reality&quot; in 2004; in 2006, Hewitt appeared as a contestant in &quot;The X Factor: Battle of the Stars&quot;, the celebrity version of &quot;The X Factor&quot;. He also appeared in the first episode of the UK &quot;Top Gear&quot; in Series 8 in May of the same year to participate with other celebrities in setting power lap times around the Top Gear Test Track in the show&#x27;s newest &quot;reasonably priced car&quot;: when the presenters seemingly did not recognise him upon his arrival, they were apparently too embarrassed to admit as much, and rather than ask him his name, they listed his lap time as &quot;Well Spoken Man&quot;.

In 2009, Hewitt opened a bar called the Polo House in the fashionable Golden Mile of Marbella, Spain. It closed in 2013.

Hewitt was portrayed by Daniel Donskoy in season four of &quot;The Crown&quot;, and by Gareth Keegan in the musical &quot;Diana&quot;.

== Personal life ==
=== Affair with the Princess of Wales ===

Hewitt&#x27;s affair with the princess began while he was still in the Household Cavalry and had been asked to give her riding lessons. News of the relationship leaked quickly and within months British newspapers published accounts of the romance, first hinted at in Nigel Dempster&#x27;s &quot;Daily Mail&quot; Diary and then with a full story in the &quot;News of the World&quot;.
Some years later, after he had left the army, Anna Pasternak published the book &quot;Princess in Love&quot; in 1994, for which Hewitt was a major source, and it alleged that he had a five-year affair with Diana, Princess of Wales from 1986 to 1991. Diana confirmed the affair in her 1995 &quot;Panorama&quot; interview. The following year, the film &quot;Princess in Love&quot; by David Greene was released, based on the book, with Julie Cox and Christopher Villiers playing the lead roles.

Hewitt considered suicide after the affair ended. He was preparing for a trip to France, and he wanted to shoot himself. He said, &quot;I got in my car and loaded a few things up to get on the ferry to go to France – to shoot myself ... And then my mother insisted on coming with me. And, if she hadn&#x27;t, I would have probably shot myself. So I owe her my life really.&quot;

In 2003, Hewitt tried to sell his 64 personal letters from Diana for £10 million. The act of selling the letters was considered to be a betrayal of trust, and Sarah, Duchess of York, who is also divorced from a British prince in Charles&#x27;s brother Prince Andrew, condemned his action. She was reported to have said, &quot;Betrayal, I think, is the most horrible, horrible, disloyal thing you can do to anyone.&quot;

Persistent suggestions have been made in the media that Hewitt, and not Charles, is the biological father of Diana&#x27;s second son, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex (born 1984). Hewitt stated to the press in 2002 and 2017 that Harry had already been born by the time of the affair, a statement also made by Diana&#x27;s royal protection officer, Inspector Ken Wharfe. Wharfe reiterated this in an interview in 2016, and in his memoir &quot;&quot; published in 2002 (and reissued in 2017) in which he says &quot;A simple comparison of dates proves it is impossible for Hewitt to be Harry&#x27;s father. ... Harry was born on September 15, 1984, which means he was conceived around Christmas 1983, when his brother, William, was 18 months old. Diana did not meet James Hewitt until the summer of 1986.&quot; 

Diana attributed Harry&#x27;s red hair colouration to her side of the family, calling him her &quot;little Spencer&quot;.

=== Legal and medical issues ===
In July 2004, Hewitt was arrested outside a restaurant in Fulham with Alison Bell, a CNN journalist, for the possession of cocaine. A drunken Hewitt had of cocaine in his pocket. He was given a warning, and Bell was released without charge. As a result, he was refused reinstatement of his firearms licences because of his &quot;intemperate habits&quot; after police found a disassembled 16-bore shotgun on his living room floor.

On 14 May 2017, it was reported that Hewitt had suffered from both a heart attack and stroke, leaving him fighting for his life in hospital. However, by the end of June 2017, Hewitt had been released from hospital and was said to be recovering well at home; in 2021, he was reportedly working as a gardener.

<doc id="292279" wikidata="Q2237599" url="?curid=292279" title="List of recurring The Simpsons characters">
<text>The American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; contains a wide range of minor and supporting characters like co-workers, teachers, students, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople, local celebrities, and even animals. The writers intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town of Springfield, where the series primarily takes place. A number of these characters have gained expanded roles and have subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to the creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the Canadian sketch comedy series &quot;Second City Television&quot;.

This article features the recurring characters from the series outside of the five main characters (Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson). Each of them are listed in order by their first name.
==A==
===Agnes Skinner===
Agnes Skinner (voiced by Tress MacNeille in most appearances, Maggie Roswell in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Rival&quot;) is the mother of Principal Skinner and first appears in the first-season episode &quot;The Crepes of Wrath&quot; as an old woman who embarrassingly addresses her son as &quot;Spanky&quot;. However, as episodes progress, her character turns bitter. She is very controlling of her son and often treats him as if he is a child, insulting and ridiculing him every chance she gets. She hates Edna Krabappel due to her son&#x27;s feelings for the other woman. Agnes has been married four times and has dated Comic Book Guy and Montgomery Burns. Many Springfield residents, including the Simpsons, are afraid of her. When &quot;the real Seymour Skinner&quot; arrives in Springfield in &quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot;, Agnes ends up rejecting him, in part because he stands up to her but also because, unlike Skinner/Tamzarian, her biological son is independent and does not need her anymore, while Skinner immediately reverts to a good-for-nothing without her.

Agnes&#x27;s first name was revealed in the seventh-season episode &quot;Bart the Fink&quot;. Before that, the character was known as &quot;Mrs. Skinner&quot;. In the beginning of the series, the writers make several references to Agnes and Seymour&#x27;s unhealthily close relationship as similar to that of Norman Bates and his mother. In &quot;Boy Meets Curl&quot;, it is revealed that Agnes&#x27;s resentment toward Seymour may have begun even before her son was born – during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Agnes competed in the pole vaulting event while nine months pregnant. When Seymour makes his first kick, he hits the bar, thus making Agnes lose and crushing her dreams (contradicting the earlier episode in which Seymour is not her birth son). In &quot;Grade School Confidential&quot;, it is revealed that Agnes enjoys collecting pictures of cakes that she cuts out of magazines, a hobby she began in 1941. However, she does not care for the dessert itself, finding it &quot;too sweet&quot;. In the 26th-season episode &quot;Sky Police&quot;, she mentions that she has a brother named Stevie.

===Akira Kurosawa===
Akira Kurosawa (voiced by George Takei in &quot;One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Bluefish&quot; and &quot;What Animated Women Want&quot;, Hank Azaria voice-matching the latter in &quot;When Flanders Failed&quot;, &quot;In Marge We Trust&quot; and &quot;Guess Who’s Coming to Criticize Dinner?&quot;) works as a waiter at The Happy Sumo, a Japanese restaurant in Springfield. He first appears in the second season episode &quot;One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish&quot;.

Actor George Takei originally voiced Akira in &quot;One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish&quot;. Since Akira&#x27;s speaking role in &quot;When Flanders Failed&quot; where the character is depicted as a karate teacher, Hank Azaria has voiced the character, doing an impression of Takei for the voice. Takei returned to voice Akira in season 24&#x27;s &quot;What Animated Women Want&quot;. The character&#x27;s name is a reference to the Japanese director Akira Kurosawa.

===Allison Taylor===
Allison Taylor (voiced by Winona Ryder in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Rival&quot;, Maggie Roswell in &quot;Lard of the Dance&quot;, Tress MacNeille in &quot;Moe Goes from Rags to Riches&quot;, and Pamela Hayden in later episodes) is in Lisa&#x27;s class but skipped a grade and has a lot in common with Lisa. She first appeared in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Rival&quot;, in which Lisa feels threatened by Allison&#x27;s talents and abilities. During a school competition, Lisa has Bart sabotage Allison&#x27;s Tell-Tale Heart diorama with a cow&#x27;s heart in a box and hide the original diorama beneath a floorboard. Wracked with guilt, Lisa returns Allison&#x27;s real diorama. Lisa and Allison both lose to Ralph Wiggum and his &quot;Star Wars&quot; figurines. Afterwards, Lisa apologizes, and the two make amends. Allison has had a few speaking roles since and has been friends with Lisa, Janey, Sherri, and Terri at school.

===Apu Nahasapeemapetilon===
===Arnie Pye===
Arnie Pye (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is a disgruntled, somewhat eccentric helicopter traffic reporter for Springfield&#x27;s KBBL-TV (Channel 6). He dislikes pompous anchorman Kent Brockman, with whom he often gets into arguments on the air. Brockman once snarled that Pye was a &quot;jackass&quot;, with Arnie responding that he believes Kent&#x27;s soul is &quot;as black as the ace of spades&quot;. On a few occasions when Kent has gotten fired from KBBL, Arnie has taken the job and done well while sounding very different from how he sounds the rest of the time (Arnie&#x27;s traffic reporter voice is high and reedy, while his anchorman voice is deep and sonorous). Arnie seems to be resigned to never surpassing his nemesis as his reaction to Kent getting the job back in &quot;Trust But Clarify&quot; was a resigned &quot;Go on, go do whatever it is you do&quot; before sulking away from the set.

===Arthur Crandall and Gabbo===
Arthur Crandall and Gabbo (both voiced by Hank Azaria) are a ventriloquist and his ventriloquist puppet who star in a children&#x27;s TV show that is in direct competition with Krusty the Clown&#x27;s. The show is a huge hit that ruins Krusty&#x27;s career, but Bart and Lisa help Krusty outdo the duo with a comeback special. The pair are later reduced to low-paying work such as a show at an Indian casino. Arthur Crandall maintains the illusion Gabbo is a person even without an audience, even having conversations with him when the camera is off. The pair mainly appeared in season four&#x27;s &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;, but they also appeared in &quot;Bart to the Future&quot;, &quot;Homerazzi&quot;, &quot;All About Lisa&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;. (See The Great Gabbo.)

===Artie Ziff===
Artie Ziff (voiced by Jon Lovitz in most appearances, Dan Castellaneta in a brief appearance in &quot;The Front&quot;) is a narcissistic Internet entrepreneur who is obsessively infatuated with Marge Simpson, his former high school classmate. Animator David Silverman based Ziff&#x27;s appearance and body language on a former high school classmate.

Ziff first appears in the episode &quot;The Way We Was&quot; (1991), in which he takes a young Marge Bouvier to senior prom. When Artie tries to grope her in his car, Marge rejects him and drives off, encountering Homer on her way home. In adulthood, Artie tries repeatedly to coerce Marge into choosing him over Homer, with Patty&#x27;s encouragement as she saw him more as the ideal husband for her sister. It is also implied that former principal Harlan Dondelinger favored Artie over Homer, believing that he would be a multimillionaire and do tasks that Homer and even Barney would never do.

In &quot;Half-Decent Proposal&quot; (2002), Marge learns that Artie is extremely wealthy, having made his fortune in computers by inventing an adapter that turns dial-up modem handshaking noises into easy-listening music. Marge reluctantly accepts a $1 million offer to spend a weekend at his mansion, in order to pay for an operation needed to cure Homer&#x27;s extremely loud snoring. Homer assumes the two are having an affair, but Artie admits that he could not win her over. Artie begins to acknowledge that his selfishness is to blame.

In &quot;The Ziff Who Came to Dinner&quot; (2004), the Simpsons discover Artie hiding in their attic after he squandered his money and started an accounting scandal at his company Ziffcorp. Artie manages to scapegoat Homer by deliberately letting Homer win 98% of Ziffcorp stocks in a poker game, thus making Homer legally liable for Artie&#x27;s deceit. However, he eventually confesses his guilt to the authorities after Marge berates Artie for his poor character, revealing that his own selfish behavior is the real reason no one likes him. After that, Artie is comforted by Selma and they spend the night together. As a result, Artie turns himself in. He was last seen about to be assaulted by angry prisoners after he doused their cigarettes with a squirt bottle.

In &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXIII&quot; (2012), Bart time-travels to 1974 and meets Marge, who is still a high school student. After he warns her not to marry Homer, Bart returns to 2012 and finds that Marge has married Artie, with Bart now named Bartie Ziff, and having inherited Artie&#x27;s curly hair. Marge leaves Artie after she instantly falls in love with a host of time-traveling Homers. She says seeing them made her realize she had married the wrong man.

In &quot;Hail to the Teeth&quot; (2020), Artie resurfaces and invites Homer and Marge to his wedding only to find out that the bride is a robot clone of Marge. He has made other robot clones of Marge that did not work well.

==B==
===Baby Gerald===
Gerald Samson, better known as Baby Gerald, also known as &quot;the one-eyebrowed baby&quot;, is Maggie Simpson&#x27;s mean-spirited archenemy, known for his large unibrow. He makes his first appearance in &quot;Sweet Seymour Skinner&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot;, where Lisa refers to Baby Gerald as Maggie&#x27;s rival. On a few occasions, Gerald has been shown being pushed in a stroller by his mother outside the Simpson house as in &quot;Lady Bouvier&#x27;s Lover&quot;, as the two toddlers glare at each other. He was also featured in the Simpsons theatrical short, &quot;The Longest Daycare.&quot; The character&#x27;s name was revealed in the episode &quot;The Canine Mutiny&quot;. In &quot;The Blue and the Gray&quot; and &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Leech&quot;, a possible romantic attraction between Maggie and Gerald is hinted at. In the non-canonical future of &quot;Days of Future Future&quot;, Gerald and Maggie are married. It is implied in &quot;Holidays of Future Passed&quot; that he is the father of Maggie Jr. and of whom her family knows except Abe. Baby Gerald appears in the show&#x27;s current title sequence (as of 2014).

===Barney Gumble===
===Bart Simpson===
===Benjamin, Doug, and Gary===
Benjamin, Doug, and Gary (voiced by Dan Castellaneta, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer, respectively) are geeks that were once Homer Simpson&#x27;s dormitory roommates at Springfield University. Benjamin carries a calculator on his belt, Doug is overweight and wears a pocket protector, and Gary wears horn-rimmed glasses and uses ear medicine. The writer of &quot;Homer Goes to College&quot;, Conan O&#x27;Brien partially based them on three guys he went to college with, who, he said, were &quot;incredible nerds&quot;. Director Jim Reardon used a caricature of animator Rich Moore and colored it black for Gary.

===Bernice Hibbert===
Bernice Hibbert (voiced by Tress MacNeille from 1999 to 2019, Maggie Roswell in &quot;Bart After Dark&quot;, Dawnn Lewis since 2021) is Dr. Julius Hibbert&#x27;s wife and is loosely based on the Clair Huxtable character from &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. The Hibberts have three children, two boys and a girl. Nevertheless, her marriage is on the rocks; she refuses to kiss her husband, even in front of an entire audience. Her drinking has been joked about on several occasions. She fainted when she read that &quot;Prohibition&quot; had been introduced to Springfield and attends Springfield Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

===Bill and Marty===
Bill and Marty (voiced by Harry Shearer and Dan Castellaneta) are two radio show hosts and DJs on Springfield&#x27;s own radio station KBBL. Bill is middle-aged and balding, while Marty is younger and has a full head of hair. They are responsible for giving Bart his elephant, Stampy, although they were surprised when Bart wanted Stampy, because they thought he would choose the other prize, $10,000. When Mr. Burns monopolized the local media in &quot;Fraudcast News&quot;, he fired the duo, but they returned to the job in later episodes.

===Billy===
Billy (voiced by Nancy Cartwright in &quot;Lisa the Simpson&quot; and Russi Taylor in &quot;Bart the Mother&quot;) is Troy McClure&#x27;s assistant who appeared in &quot;Lisa the Simpson&quot;, and &quot;Bart the Mother&quot;. He was supposed to appear in more episodes, but due to the death of McClure&#x27;s voice actor Phil Hartman, he was retired along with McClure. Billy is a child who appears in Troy McClure&#x27;s educational films. He appears in the films &quot;Birds: Our Fine Feathered Colleagues&quot;, and &quot;Someone&#x27;s in the Kitchen with DNA&quot;. A similar child named Jimmy (who at one point McClure also calls Billy) appears in &quot;The Meat Council Presents: &#x27;Meat and You: Partners in Freedom in the episode, &quot;Lisa the Vegetarian&quot;.

===Birch Barlow===
Birchibald &quot;Birch&quot; T. Barlow (voiced by Harry Shearer in &quot;Sideshow Bob Roberts&quot; and &quot;You Kent Always Say What You Want&quot;) is a conservative talk show host on the radio station KBBL, modeled after Rush Limbaugh. As of &quot;You Kent Always Say What You Want&quot;, he also has a show on Fox News, and serves as a parody of Fox News&#x27; conservative bias.

On his radio show, he declares himself to be &quot;the fourth branch of government&quot; and &quot;the fifty-first state&quot;. He authored the book &quot;Only Turkeys Have Left Wings&quot;. Barlow plays an important part in the episode &quot;Sideshow Bob Roberts&quot;, in which Sideshow Bob, while jailed, calls Barlow on his radio show, giving Bob an outlet to voice how the prison treats him unfairly. Barlow, knowing Bob is a fellow Republican, sympathizes with his complaints, and influences the rest of Springfield to do so as well. This leads to Bob&#x27;s prompt release and ensuing mayoral election-rigging. While Barlow endorses Bob for mayor to the Springfield Republican Party, it is implied he had nothing to do with the electoral fraud, as Bob clears his name in a fit of egomaniacal boasting when Lisa accuses Bob of being Barlow&#x27;s puppet.

Barlow appears in the episode &quot;We&#x27;re on the Road to D&#x27;ohwhere&quot; as a customer at Marge&#x27;s prescription drug-laden &quot;yard sale&quot;, a reference to Limbaugh&#x27;s Oxycontin addiction. Most recently Barlow appears with other Springfield Republicans in the episode &quot;E Pluribus Wiggum&quot;, in which he tells Lisa to make Ralph Wiggum decide whether he wants to run for president as a Republican or a Democrat.

===Bleeding Gums Murphy===
Oscar &quot;Bleeding Gums&quot; Murphy (voiced by Ron Taylor in &quot;Moaning Lisa&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Round Springfield&quot;, Daryl L. Coley in &quot;Dancin&#x27; Homer&quot;, Harry Shearer in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Pony&quot;, Kevin Michael Richardson in &quot;The Sound of Bleeding Gums&quot;) is a jazz musician, idol, and mentor of Lisa Simpson. His real name was Oscar as mentioned by his nephew in &quot;Lisa Gets the Blues&quot;. In his first appearance, Murphy explains the origins of his nickname: &quot;You ever been to the dentist? Not me.&quot;

His most significant roles were in the episodes &quot;Moaning Lisa&quot; and &#x27;Round Springfield&quot;. In &#x27;Round Springfield&quot;, it is revealed that at one point he enjoyed a fairly successful career, releasing an album (&quot;Sax on the Beach&quot;) and appearing on Steve Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, as well as on an episode of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; as one of the Cosby children&#x27;s grandfathers, but he quickly lost his money feeding his addiction to purchasing Fabergé eggs.

Murphy teaches Lisa to display her emotions through music, prompting Lisa to hold him as an important figure in her life. His last appearance was in &#x27;Round Springfield&quot;, when, after Bart ends up in the hospital, Lisa wanders off to find Murphy in a nearby ward. He explains about his life, family, and work to her, as well as giving her advice for her upcoming school performance, giving her his saxophone. When Lisa returns, she finds out that Murphy has died from circumstances which are never revealed. No one, except for Lisa, attends Murphy&#x27;s funeral. Lisa realizes that despite being gone physically, he still is alive in her, and honors his memory by having his album played at a local radio station. Murphy appears from the Heavens thanking Lisa for that.

It is strongly hinted in the same episode that Murphy and Dr. Julius Hibbert are long-lost brothers by Murphy&#x27;s quote: &quot;I don&#x27;t really have a family. All I had was a little brother who grew up to become a doctor. He used to laugh at the most inappropriate times.&quot; Hibbert laughs inappropriately and says, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;ve got an older brother that I&#x27;ll never see! He&#x27;s a jazz musician or some such. Oh well, bye-bye!&quot; Each fails to recognize the other.

The episode &quot;The Sound of Bleeding Gums&quot; reveals that Bleeding Gums Murphy has a deaf son named Monk (voiced by John Autry II). His ghost gives advice to Lisa on how to see eye to eye with Monk. When Monk gets a cochlear implant, Lisa plays his father&#x27;s song which he states that he can finally hear. Bleeding Gums Murphy&#x27;s ghost thanks Lisa for helping his son to hear his song.

Bleeding Gums Murphy is loosely based on Blind Willie Johnson, at whose feet the young Bleeding Gums character learned. His saxophone playing is provided by Dan Higgins. In &quot;The Great Wife Hope&quot;, Carl mentions he met Drederick Tatum while he was at a party with Dr. Hibbert at Murphy&#x27;s house. In &quot;Whiskey Business&quot;, Murphy appears as a hologram, causing Lisa to protest against his record label&#x27;s use of his image for commercials. He appears in other episodes such as &quot;Bart the Daredevil&quot; (where he is yellow), &quot;Dancin&#x27; Homer&quot;, &quot;Old Money&quot;, &quot;Flaming Moe&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Bart Gets an &#x27;F&#x27;, &quot;Radio Bart&quot;, and &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Pony&quot;.

===Blinky===
Blinky is a three-eyed orange fish featured primarily in &quot;Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish&quot;. Likely mutated by toxic waste from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant pouring into the river, Blinky became a major news story when he was caught by Bart Simpson. Mr. Burns defends the fish, arguing that his extra eye is merely the next step in evolution. Mr. Burns goes to the Simpsons&#x27; house for a meal to boost his race for governor. Marge, a supporter of Burns&#x27; opponent Mary Bailey, deliberately serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns spits the fish out and subsequently loses the election. Before then, Blinky made an earlier appearance in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;. He is later seen again in later episodes like &quot;Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in &#x27;The Curse of the Flying Hellfish&#x27;. Episodes have portrayed Blinky as iconography for Springfield, such as appearing on maps. Blinky also made a brief appearance in an underwater section of the tube-way Fry travels through in the pilot episode of the animated series &quot;Futurama&quot;, which was created by &quot;The Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening. Blinky also appears in an episode of &quot;Futurama&quot;″s seventh season titled &quot;T.: The Terrestrial&quot;, on a fish bowl on Jrrr&#x27;s desk.

===Blue-Haired Lawyer===
Mr. Burns&#x27; Lawyer, also known as The Blue-Haired Lawyer (voiced by Dan Castellaneta), is Springfield&#x27;s most prominent and powerful lawyer. His name has never been revealed. He first appeared in the second season episode &quot;Bart Gets Hit by a Car&quot;. He is known for his blue hair, authoritarian nature and nasal New York City accent. He also occasionally appears to serve as a prosecutor. Unlike Lionel Hutz or Gil Gunderson, he is competent, although not necessarily ethical. He has served as Mr. Burns&#x27; head lawyer, helping him out with threats of the Power Plant closing down and of Burns losing his money. He is a member of the Springfield Republican Party. His clients tend to be antagonists to the Simpsons, although he has also defended them on occasion. The Blue-Haired Lawyer also played a very important role in Bart&#x27;s emancipation in &quot;Barting Over&quot;.

The character&#x27;s demeanor and Castellaneta&#x27;s voice for the character are based on Roy Cohn, best known as Joe McCarthy&#x27;s chief counsel during the Second Red Scare of the 1950s, and later legal advisor and mentor to Donald Trump. Animator Jim Reardon modeled the character&#x27;s appearance on actor Charles Lane.

===Booberella===
Barbara Rellalinsky, more commonly known as Booberella (voiced by Tress MacNeille), is a buxom television host who dresses like a female vampire and speaks with a Romanian accent. She is a parody of Cassandra Peterson and her character Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. Booberella is proud of her ample breasts and takes every chance to mention &quot;her boobs&quot;, stretching out the &quot;oo&quot;. Booberella&#x27;s television show is a spoof of &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Movie Macabre&quot;, a horror film anthology series. Booberella first appears in the episode &quot;I&#x27;m Spelling as Fast as I Can&quot;, in which Bart and Homer watch her show. Booberella&#x27;s name alludes to Vampirella (Forrest James Ackerman&#x27;s comic book vampire character) and to the 1968 cult film &quot;Barbarella&quot;, which stars Jane Fonda in the title role.

===Brandine Spuckler===
Brandine Spuckler (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is married to Cletus Spuckler. Brandine and Cletus are depicted as stereotypical hillbillies. Throughout the series, there were outlandish theories that the two are siblings, boyfriend and girlfriend, mother and son, or father and daughter, have been suggested, with Cletus simply stating &quot;we&#x27;s all kinds of things&quot;. In one episode, she is apparently the daughter of Cletus and an alien. She has suffered from rabies, and admitted to being illiterate. This has been contradicted by the episode &quot;Pretty Whittle Liar&quot;. More recently, Brandine is shown fighting in the Iraq War. She comes back revealing Cletus is the father of only two of the kids, casting doubt over the paternity of all the other children. Assuming that all of the children believed to be Cletus&#x27; are also hers, Brandine has 45 specifically named children. Brandine and Cletus were married by Homer during his brief stint as a minister. On April 27, 2008, more is revealed about Cletus and Brandine in an episode entitled &quot;Apocalypse Cow&quot;; Brandine had married Cletus at the age of 13, having been married four times previously. Brandine has had several low-level jobs, such as working for Dairy Queen, a strip club, and an infantryman for the U.S. Army. She has also been in prison, where she developed a liking for indoor plumbing, which the Spuckler homestead lacks.

===Brunella Pommelhorst===
Brunella Pommelhorst (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is the gym teacher at Springfield Elementary School. Pommelhorst first appeared in &quot;Stark Raving Dad&quot;, although Pommelhorst&#x27;s name is not mentioned until &quot;The PTA Disbands&quot; (when a little girl left hanging on the gymnastic rings after the teachers walk out due to a strike calls for &quot;Mrs. Pommelhorst&quot; to let her down). Pommelhorst&#x27;s name is a play on &quot;pommel horse&quot; and she has blond hair and usually wears a whistle. She takes a tough-as-nails approach to teaching. In &quot;Little Girl in the Big Ten&quot;, Pommelhorst decides to fail Lisa because of an oath she took on &quot;&quot; but allows her to make it up by taking private lessons. In &quot;My Fair Laddy&quot;, Pommelhorst takes a leave of absence to get a sex-change operation and returns as &quot;Mr. Pommelhorst&quot; (implying that Pommelhorst is a transgender man), the new shop teacher. She is replaced by Coach Krupt. Despite this, the character has appeared in later episodes as a woman.

===Bumblebee Man===
Bumblebee Man (voiced by Hank Azaria from 1992 to 2020, Eric Lopez since 2020) is the star of a Mexican Spanish-language television sitcom on &quot;Channel Ocho&quot; in which he dresses in a bumblebee costume and performs Slapstick comedy. In the episode &quot;Team Homer&quot;, his bowling shirt suggests that his name is &quot;Pedro&quot;, though he is informally referred to as &quot;Chespirito&quot;. He works at the same studio as Kent Brockman. His first appearance was in &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy: The Movie&quot;. Bumblebee Man never takes off his costume in public, and almost never in private, except for the episode &quot;22 Short Films About Springfield&quot;, in which his private life is shown. In this short segment, he is portrayed as very clumsy rather than simply acting as such.

In general, Bumblebee Man only speaks in simple, over-enunciated (and often inaccurate) Spanish sentences. His catchphrases of choice are typically &quot;¡Ay, ay, ay, no me gusta!&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t like it!&quot;), &quot;¡Ay, no es bueno!&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s not good!&quot;) and &quot;¡Ay, Dios no me ama!&quot; (&quot;God doesn&#x27;t love me!&quot;). Quite commonly, his phrases will be intentionally sloppy Spanish. For example, in the episode &quot;22 Short Films About Springfield&quot;, there are several words used that are not real (such as &quot;wudpequero&quot; for &quot;woodpecker&quot;, rather than the correct &quot;pájaro carpintero&quot;). The crude Spanish is used so that English-speaking viewers would still understand it audibly rather than subtitled. However, the sole examples that feature him speaking English are briefly in &quot;Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington&quot; and in &quot;Bart Gets Famous&quot;, which is the episode that has a part where he anchors the news with an English accent, filling in for Kent Brockman, who would not report the news because he did not get his Danish pastry, which Bart stole to give to Krusty.

Bumblebee Man is a caricature parody of &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;, a character created and portrayed by Mexican television comedian Roberto Gómez Bolaños (a.k.a. &quot;Chespirito&quot;), and his show consists of simple skits, often involving heavy slapstick. The staff have said that whenever they watched Univision, this character was &quot;always on&quot;, thus they created Bumblebee Man, who is also always on the air when the Spanish-language channel is depicted. His costume was based on one used in the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch &quot;The Killer Bees&quot;.

In 2003, Azaria won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing Bumblebee Man, and various other characters.

==C==
===C.H.U.M.===
C.H.U.M. (voiced by Dan Castellaneta), short for Childlike Humanoid Urban Muchacho, is a robot that Martin Prince built in &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot; for a science fair at Springfield Elementary School. In &quot;Future-Drama&quot; Martin dances with it at the prom in the future and the robot activates the self-destruction mechanism. In &quot;Gorgeous Grampa&quot;, Bart hit C.H.U.M. over the head with a folding chair and then proceeded to climb to the blackboard ledge and jump on the robot, breaking it. In &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbart&quot; appears catching a Rattle Snitch on &quot;Peekimon Get&quot; on Frank Grimes&#x27; grave.

===Capital City Goofball===
The Capital City Goofball (voiced by Tom Poston) is the mascot for Capital City. His appearance seems to have been inspired by the mascot of the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team, the Phillie Phanatic. The costume is a creature with a baseball body, with a blue Capital City T-shirt, yellow arms and legs, a long flat-ended nose, tufts of fur at the side, a red hat with two springs, two costume eyes that look in either direction, and two more eyes that peek outside the mouth. The Capital City Goofball first appeared in the episode &quot;Dancin&#x27; Homer&quot; and shared the stage with Homer. He also appears in &quot;Radio Bart&quot; as one of many celebrities recording a charity single. After that, he is absent until &quot;Homer to the Max&quot;, where he walks past the Simpsons window alongside Mr Largo when Lisa talks about TV shows rewriting or dropping characters that appear early on. In &quot;Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade&quot;, the Capital City Goofball represents Capital City in the state legislature; he spent $80 million out of his own pocket to win the seat, and now is leading an effort to change the state&#x27;s embarrassing flag, a Confederate battle flag set between the ocean and the rays of the sun (especially as the state was in the North).

After Tom Poston&#x27;s death in 2007, the character was reduced to making minor background appearances and usual honking sounds, and has not spoken since &quot;Bart and Lisa vs. the Third Grade&quot;.

===Captain Lance Murdock===
Captain Lance Murdock (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is a professional stunt devil who appeared more in the early days of the show rather than the newer episodes. He first appeared in &quot;Bart the Daredevil&quot; which featured him in more scenes than other episodes. He later appeared in &quot;I Married Marge&quot;, &quot;Selma&#x27;s Choice&quot;, and &quot;Viva Ned Flanders&quot;. He was most recently featured when Krusty was flicking channels on his TV in &quot;Today I Am a Clown&quot;. He also appears in Lisa&#x27;s lecture about Lake Springfield in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; sitting in the audience. His stunts often end in disaster, such as in &quot;Viva Ned Flanders&quot;, and &quot;Bart the Daredevil&quot;, where he states that he has broken every bone in his body after a failed stunt (he did have one unbroken bone, his thumb, but broke it when trying to give Bart a thumbs-up). His signature bike is the Suicycle and he has his own action figure complete with an ambulance.

===Carl Carlson===
Carlton Carlson (voiced by Harry Shearer in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Night Out&quot; and &quot;Brush with Greatness&quot;; Hank Azaria from season 2 to 31; Alex Désert since season 32) is Homer&#x27;s friend and co-worker (sometimes identified as his supervisor) at the Nuclear Power Plant and is often seen with Lenny. He likes to call himself &quot;an urban Lenny.&quot; He attended Springfield A&amp;M University.

Carl is an Icelandic-African American, with a master&#x27;s degree in nuclear physics, fond of bowling and drinking at Moe&#x27;s Tavern. Carl is frequently said to be among the most attractive men in Springfield; in &quot;Principal Charming&quot;, Homer concludes that Carl is too attractive for Selma. According to &quot;They Saved Lisa&#x27;s Brain&quot;, he might be diabetic, while according to &quot;The Dad Who Knew Too Little&quot; he might be severely schizophrenic. In &#x27;Scuse Me While I Miss the Sky&quot;, it was revealed that Carl spent at least part of his boyhood in Iceland.

The episode &quot;The Saga of Carl&quot; provides his origin story, describing how he was raised in Iceland. The episode includes his reunion with his Icelandic parents, who adopted him at an unspecified age from an unspecified nation. The episode&#x27;s plot revolves around the Carlson family curse, which had tarnished their reputation in Iceland for centuries.

In the early seasons, Carl was rarely seen with Lenny and did not have a consistent voice – on some occasions, he can be heard with Lenny&#x27;s voice and vice versa. One example of Carl having Lenny&#x27;s voice is in &quot;Brush with Greatness&quot;. In an early 1991 episode, &quot;Principal Charming&quot;, Carl&#x27;s name is spelled &quot;Karl&quot;, the same spelling seen for an unrelated character of the same season.

Lenny and Carl are best friends, as they are rarely seen apart; their other friends are Homer, and regulars at Moe&#x27;s including Barney Gumble and Moe Szyslak. Homer repeatedly confuses Lenny and Carl, and is shocked to learn on one occasion that Lenny is white, and Carl is black. To guide himself, Homer has &quot;Lenny = White, Carl = Black&quot; on his hand. He once muttered to himself, &quot;Is that right?&quot; while reading it. In &quot;Helter Shelter&quot;, Homer exclaims, &quot;That&#x27;s Lenny? I wanted the black one!&quot; When Mr. Burns appears on a radio show in an attempt to boost his popularity in &quot;Monty Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, Homer tells him that he has a list of jokes explaining the differences between white and black people; Homer later states, &quot;White guys have names like Lenny, whereas black guys have names like Carl.&quot;

Lenny and Carl work at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant alongside Homer Simpson. 
Lenny and Carl together rank sixth on IGN&#x27;s Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters.

===Cecil Terwilliger===
Cecil Onderdonk Terwilliger (voiced by David Hyde Pierce) is the younger brother of Robert Onderdonk Terwilliger, a.k.a. Sideshow Bob. His first appearance was in the episode &quot;Brother from Another Series&quot;, where it was revealed that Bob only got the job as Krusty&#x27;s sideshow ten years ago because Cecil, who had always wanted to be a children&#x27;s entertainer, failed his audition. He later became Springfield&#x27;s &quot;Chief Hydrological and Hydrodynamical Engineer&quot; although he planned to blow up the new hydroelectric dam he was building, so that nobody would know how cheaply it was made. Cecil kept most of the building money for himself, making it look as if it was his brother. However, Sideshow Bob, Lisa and Bart worked together to successfully foil him. Eventually, after losing the money, Cecil attempted to kill Bart which Bob never could, but ironically, this was foiled by Bob himself. His second appearance was in the episode &quot;Funeral for a Fiend&quot;, where, following Robert&#x27;s death, he convinced Bart to go to his cremation. It turned out, though, that Sideshow Bob faked the whole thing in another elaborate plot to kill Bart.

He is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who also plays the younger brother of Sideshow Bob&#x27;s voice actor Kelsey Grammer&#x27;s character in &quot;Frasier&quot;. Cecil&#x27;s mannerisms and his relationship with his brother are also loosely based on Niles and Frasier&#x27;s relationship in &quot;Frasier&quot;. Cecil makes a third appearance in the episode &quot;O Brother, Where Bart Thou?&quot;, where he and Bob are happily flying kites across a park in Bart&#x27;s dream of wanting a younger brother.

===Cesar and Ugolin===
Cesar (voiced by Harry Shearer in most appearances, Hank Azaria in &quot;To Courier with Love&quot;) and Ugolin (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) are an uncle-and-nephew pair of stereotypical Frenchmen who, in &quot;The Crepes of Wrath&quot;, make Bart a slave at their &quot;Chateau Maison&quot; winery and put antifreeze in their wine to increase the profit.

In &quot;Lisa the Greek&quot;, they are briefly shown watching TV in their apartment.

In &quot;To Courier with Love&quot;, they are leathermakers who try to kill an endangered blue snake that Homer was supposed to send them to pay for a trip to France. They try to capture it on their own and fail.

They take their names from Cesar and Ugolin, shifty and greedy uncle-and-nephew characters from the films &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; and &quot;Manon des Sources&quot;.

===Charlie===
Charlie (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as the &#x27;Dangerous Emissions Supervisor&#x27;. Due to reporting gross safety violations (including a painted-on emergency exit door), he was briefly replaced by Mindy Simmons, but she got fired afterwards due to alcoholism and disruptive behavior. His first appearance was in &quot;Life on the Fast Lane&quot;. He was briefly out of work due to an unnamed on-the-job injury, where he collected workers&#x27; compensation; however, future episodes show him back to work. He has a wife and two kids, as well as a sister with a wooden leg (which Charlie used as a lucky bat). In &quot;The Trouble with Trillions&quot;, Charlie tells Homer (who is working undercover) that he has plans to overrun the American government due to their stalling on making HDTV available; he is soon arrested by FBI agents for conspiracy.

Dan Castellaneta said that he did &quot;an imitation of Lenny&quot; for the voice.

===Chase/Pyro===
Chase, also known as Pyro, (voiced by Hank Azaria) is an American Gladiator. He is a parody of the real-life Gladiator Nitro and first appears in the episode &quot;A Milhouse Divided&quot;, dating Luann after her divorce. Their relationship ends when she is caught cheating with his own best friend, Gladiator Gyro.

He also appears in &quot;Wild Barts Can&#x27;t Be Broken&quot;, &quot;Mom and Pop Art&quot;, &quot;Alone Again, Natura-Diddily&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge&quot;, &quot;Day of the Jackanapes&quot;, &quot;A Star Is Born Again&quot; and &quot;The Bart of War&quot;.

===Chief Wiggum===
===Cletus Spuckler===
Cletus Del Roy Montfort Bigglesworth Spuckler (voiced by Hank Azaria), commonly called Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel, is Springfield&#x27;s resident hillbilly stereotype, and speaks with a Southern United States accent. He is usually portrayed wearing a white sleeveless shirt and blue jeans.

He was named 7th in IGN&#x27;s Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters.

Cletus was introduced during the fifth season of the show, in &quot;Bart Gets an Elephant&quot;, as one of the &quot;slack-jawed yokels&quot; gawking at Bart&#x27;s elephant Stampy. Cletus&#x27; voice is slightly deeper in this initial appearance than in later episodes. He, like the Sea Captain before him, was the go-to character for a quick laugh on the show, and is a staff favorite. He made several generic appearances on the show before being given his first name in &quot;Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily&quot;.

Cletus&#x27; low intelligence is usually portrayed as the result of inbreeding and jokes are occasionally made which refer to his partner Brandine being related to him. It has been suggested that Brandine is Cletus&#x27; mother and sister. The two are shown to have a large number of children with stereotypical &quot;hillbilly&quot; names, and add to their family casually. In the episode &quot;Apocalypse Cow&quot;, one of his many daughters, Mary, received a cow from Bart, which Bart wanted Mary to care for. Cletus mistook this for a proposal, and almost married the two. He is said to have 70 kids, at least 45 of whom have been named in episodes.

The first name Cletus came from writer Jeff Martin&#x27;s boyhood little league baseball coach in Houston, Texas.

His last name was given as &quot;Del Roy&quot; in the episode &quot;Behind the Laughter&quot;. In &quot;Marge vs. Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens, and Gays&quot;, his name is given as &quot;Cletus Spuckler&quot; in a news report. In the episodes &quot;Sweets and Sour Marge&quot; and &quot;Yokel Hero&quot;, he signs his name as Cletus Spuckler.

===Coach Lugash===
Coach Lugash (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is a gym teacher who coached Lisa in the episodes &quot;Children of a Lesser Clod&quot; and &quot;Little Girl in the Big Ten&quot;. He has anger problems and later makes brief appearances. Springfield Elementary gym teacher Brunella Pommelhorst mentions that he defected into East Germany from the West.

===Coach Krupt===
Coach Krupt (voiced by Hank Azaria) is the gym teacher at Springfield Elementary School following Miss Pummelhorst&#x27;s departure to have a sex-change operation. He is obsessed with the game Bombardment and plays it relentlessly, spilling over into his personal life when, whilst dining at the Gilded Truffle, he pelts Groundskeeper Wille (who working there as a waiter) with bread rolls and yells &quot;bombardment&quot; when ordering. He can be seen in season 20&#x27;s &quot;How the Test Was Won&quot; training the students for their standardized tests and hurling rubber balls at those who give wrong answers and has since made minor cameos in later episodes. He has a wife, daughter, and son.

===Comic Book Guy===
===Cookie Kwan===
Cookie Kwan (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is an Asian American real estate broker who first appears in the episode &quot;Realty Bites&quot;. She is the stereotypical competitive woman with a thick Asian accent that she has been trying to lose since she was a child. She touts herself as being &quot;number one on the West Side&quot;, although she also works on the East Side. She is very aggressive toward anyone she deems a threat to her business, evidenced by when she threatens Gil Gunderson. She once attempted to seduce Ned Flanders, has had an illegitimate child with Mayor Quimby, and has flirted with Homer. She is friends with Lindsey Naegle. She is a Republican. She is played by MacNeille with a strong and harsh stereotypical Chinese accent.

===Count Dracula===
Count Dracula (voiced by Hank Azaria in later appearances, Dan Castellaneta in early appearances) is a vampire based on the character of the same name. He is often seen as a member in the Springfield Republican Party, as a vampire with white skin, and black suit and cloak.

===Cowboy Bob===
Cowboy Bob (voiced by Albert Brooks in &quot;The Call of the Simpsons&quot;, Dan Castellaneta in &quot;Mobile Homer&quot;) is an RV salesman in cowboy hat who first appeared in &quot;The Call of the Simpsons&quot;. Bob works at Bob&#x27;s RV Roundup, but claims he does not own the place – although this could be part of his sales pitch, given the manner he tells this to Homer. He is a typical hard-sell salesman who manages to sell Homer a cheap old RV due to his lack of financial funds. Cowboy Bob appears in the episodes &quot;The Call of the Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Bart Gets an &#x27;F&#x27;, &quot;When Flanders Failed&quot;, &quot;Mobile Homer&quot;, and &quot;Yellow Subterfuge&quot;. He also has a small part in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;.

===Crazy Cat Lady===
Eleanor Abernathy (voiced by Tress MacNeille), better known as the Crazy Cat Lady, is a woman with the appearance and behavior of a stereotypical mentally ill animal hoarder. She first appears in &quot;Girly Edition&quot;. Abernathy is always surrounded by a large number of cats, and in every appearance, she screams gibberish and/or throws cats at passersby. She gives Lisa one of her cats, Snowball V, who looks exactly like her original Snowball II. Despite appearing older by her white hair and careless appearance, she is the same age as Marge, Homer and Moe.

Abernathy was once a bright, vibrant young woman. When she was eight, Abernathy wanted to be both a doctor and a lawyer as she believed a woman can be whatever she wants to be if she just sets her mind to it. At 16, she began studying for law school, and by 24 she earned a law degree from Yale Law School and a medical degree from Harvard Medical School. When she turned 32, Abernathy suffered from psychological exhaustion, became an alcoholic, and sought solace in her pet cat. The once-promising young doctor/lawyer became a raving, cat-hoarding lunatic. Abernathy briefly reverts to her sanity and high intelligence thanks to some pills, but after Marge points out that the pills are actually Reese&#x27;s Pieces candy, Abernathy abruptly resumes her deranged behavior. When participating in a mayoral election, she lucidly discusses topics such as health care, economy and public education in between her screams and gibberish.

In the episode &quot;Eeny Teeny Maya Moe&quot;, Abernathy reveals that she once owned a cat with Moe Szyslak after he says that there &quot;Is a much creepier guy right next to me.&quot; from a public library computer. She yells &quot;You know I&#x27;m a woman!&quot; and also that their cat had kittens; she then proclaims that &quot;These are yours!&quot; and throws three cats at him. She is also seen in &quot;The Blue and the Gray&quot; flirting (and swapping animals) with another mentally ill person carrying dogs. In the episode &quot;A Midsummer&#x27;s Nice Dream&quot;, Abernathy is shown to be a hoarder. After Marge helps her clean up her house, she begins speaking normally and wearing proper clothing. Later, in an attempt to fix Marge&#x27;s new hoarding problem, Abernathy reverts to her crazy self, reclaiming all of the hoarded junk and calling her cats back to her.

In the episode &quot;Monty Burns&#x27; Fleeing Circus&quot;, Abernathy shows she has an opera-quality singing voice.

===Crusher and Lowblow===
Joey &quot;Crusher&quot; (voiced by Hank Azaria) and Lowblow (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) are a pair of stereotypical henchmen often found in the employment of Montgomery Burns as he prefers the hands-on touch you only get with hired goons. Crusher&#x27;s first appearance was in the second-season episode &quot;Blood Feud&quot; where he is seen escorting Homer off the premises of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The two seem to be on first name terms as Homer calls him Joey. Their first appearance together was in the episode &quot;Last Exit to Springfield&quot; when the two of them kidnap Homer and take him to Burns Manor so that Mr. Burns can speak to him. They introduce themselves as &quot;hired goons&quot;. Crusher and Lowblow rarely had speaking roles and were often used as Mr Burns&#x27; henchmen (and the henchmen for The Blue-Haired Lawyer as seen in the beginning of &quot;Lisa the Beauty Queen&quot; and several scenes in &quot;Lady Bouvier&#x27;s Lover&quot;).

==D==
===Database===
Database (alternatively voiced by Nancy Cartwright, Tress MacNeille, and Pamela Hayden; real name Kyle according to &quot;Yellow Subterfuge&quot;) is a nerdy student who attends Springfield Elementary School. He first appeared in the episode &quot;Bart&#x27;s Comet&quot; as a member of &quot;the Super Friends&quot;. He has since had speaking parts in several episodes. He is usually seen with his fellow nerd Martin Prince. Database is a common target for Nelson, Dolph, Jimbo and Kearney. Database is part of the group of boys who invade Shelbyville in &quot;Lemon of Troy&quot;. He is one of the Pre-Teen Braves in the episode &quot;The Bart of War&quot;. He is a member of the school band, as seen in &quot;The PTA Disbands&quot;. Database is known for his annoying, nerdy voice which is supplied by Nancy Cartwright. Database&#x27;s father is shown in &quot;Lemon of Troy&quot;, although he utters no dialogue and is only in the background. Matt Groening has stated that Database is his least favorite character in the show.

===Dave Shutton===
Dave Shutton (voiced by Harry Shearer) is a reporter for &quot;The Springfield Shopper&quot;. Writer John Swartzwelder named Shutton after a friend of his. His first appearance was in &quot;Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish&quot;.

Since then, his roles have become less relevant and have been reduced to short appearances. According to &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)&quot;, Kent Brockman does not like Dave Shutton and thinks he is unprofessional.

===Declan Desmond===
Declan Desmond (voiced by Eric Idle) is an odd and skeptical English documentary filmmaker who has directed several films, including &quot;Do You Want Lies with That?&quot;, &quot;American Boneheads: A Day In The Life Of Springfield Elementary&quot;, &quot;Growing Up Springfield&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain: A Blind Man Climbs Everest&quot;, and &quot;The Spy Who Learned Me&quot;. &quot;Growing Up Springfield&quot; is his most notable documentary. It follows the lives of the inhabitants of Springfield, starting when they were in third grade and continuing every eight years. Desmond appeared in the episodes &#x27;Scuse Me While I Miss the Sky&quot; and &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot; and his &quot;Growing Up Springfield&quot; series were featured in the episode &quot;Springfield Up&quot;. A documentary directed by him appeared in &quot;The Spy Who Learned Me&quot;.

The character appears to be loosely based on British director Michael Apted, who is known for his &quot;Up&quot; Series of documentaries following groups of individuals as they age.

===Dewey Largo===
Dewey Largo (voiced by Harry Shearer) is the music teacher, whom Lisa credited with proving that any piece of music could have the soul sucked out of it. Like most of the staff of Springfield Elementary, Largo has long since lost all passion for his job as conductor, and cares little for creativity or music anymore. He is always seen in the opening sequence, teaching his class and throwing Lisa out of his band class when she plays a tune on her saxophone. His last name, &quot;Largo&quot;, is also an Italian word for a slow, broad, musical tempo, likely a reference to the fact that he can make any piece of music uninteresting. He is a lover of the music of John Philip Sousa, and is incredulous when Lisa suggests the school band plays something different. However, he does seem to have some appreciation for Lisa&#x27;s musical talent, as shown when he advises his replacement to &quot;just teach the one with the starfish head, and you&#x27;ll be okay&quot;.

He has not played a large role in the series, but was originally intended to be an uptight foil for Lisa and her non-conformist ways. After the first few seasons, Mr. Largo was rarely seen. However, he has since resurfaced as a recurring character in the seventeenth season, making appearances in several episodes after. In the episode &quot;Homer&#x27;s Paternity Coot&quot;, it is revealed that Largo was accepted to the Juilliard School, but never got the letter as it was frozen atop Mount Springfield. He ended up at Springfield Elementary instead. In season 22&#x27;s &quot;Elementary School Musical&quot;, after attending a performing arts camp, Lisa is warned by Mr Largo that he also attended one as a child, and that they just &quot;fill your head with sugarcandy dreams that can&#x27;t come true.&quot; A recurring gag since the 17th-season episode &quot;See Homer Run&quot;, are allusions that Largo is gay. The 22nd-season episode &quot;Flaming Moe&quot; confirmed that Largo is gay and in a relationship with an older man, also named Dewey. In &quot;Eeny Teeny Maya Moe&quot;, Dr. Nick mistakenly makes Mr Largo shorter, instead of Moe. It is implied Dr. Nick was about to give Moe the sex-change operation that was originally meant for Largo, as he is heard to cry: &quot;I look nothing like Julie Newmar!&quot;. The 30th-season episode &quot;Girl&#x27;s in the Band&quot; depicts him with a partner named Geoffrey, who appears alongside him in subsequent episodes. &quot;My Fair Laddy&quot; reveals that he is considered the second least important employee of the school after Willie, as he is demoted to groundskeeper after Willie leaves.

===Disco Stu===
Disco Stu, real name Stuart Discothèque (voiced by Hank Azaria), is a man who is mentally stuck in the disco era. He is normally featured wearing a rhinestone-encrusted leisure suit. Stu was introduced as the punchline to a joke in &quot;Two Bad Neighbors&quot;. In a rummage sale, Homer attempts to sell a jacket on which he had once tried to write &quot;Disco Stud&quot; in rhinestones, but having made the letters too big he did not have room for the final &quot;d&quot;. After Marge remarks that nobody would ever want to buy a jacket that read &quot;Disco Stu&quot;, another customer recommends it to Stu, but Stu replies, &quot;Disco Stu does &quot;not&quot; advertise.&quot;

Stu&#x27;s speech pattern is similar to that of Duffman, also voiced by Hank Azaria; he speaks in the third person, often referring to himself as &quot;Disco Stu&quot; (emphasizing &quot;Stu&quot; and then pausing before saying anything else; whatever follows usually rhymes with &quot;Stu&quot;). According to &quot;How I Spent My Strummer Vacation&quot;, Stu actually is aware disco is dead, does not like disco music at all, and worries that his personality may make him a &quot;one-note guy&quot;. His brief marriage to Selma Bouvier was annulled by Pope John Paul II. In &quot;How I Wet Your Mother&quot;, Professor Frink creates a device that allows people to enter the dreams of others. He stated he had already used the device &quot;To cure another Springfielder of his particular obsession&quot; at which point Stu walks into the frame in khakis and a collared shirt saying, &quot;Normal Stu likes normal things.&quot; In &quot;Homer Scissorhands&quot;, Stu is seen attending a ball alone, saying his girlfriend is not feeling well. She is then seen arriving arm-in-arm with Krusty the Clown. In the episode &quot;Springfield Up&quot;, it is revealed that in his younger years, he had a budding career as a sea captain, going by the name of &quot;Nautical Stu&quot;, and only finds the joy of disco music when Marge puts some on while taking his picture for his captain&#x27;s license.

Show runner Bill Oakley described the original Disco Stu as &quot;an old, wrinkly John Travolta&quot;. Stu was originally to be voiced by repeat guest star Phil Hartman. However, when the animators remodeled the character, Hartman was not available to dub the voice and so Hank Azaria took over the role. Out of 25, IGN named Stu the 24th top peripheral character in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

===Doctor Colossus===
Doctor Hector von Colossus (voiced by Hank Azaria) is a supervillain and mad scientist who resides in Springfield. He has light blue skin and wears a white laboratory coat, gloves and goggles. Doctor Colossus is a minor character and usually only appears in the background.

The character first appeared in the episode &quot;Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy&quot; as one of Stacy Lovell&#x27;s ex-husbands.

In &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot;, Doctor Colossus is the archenemy of Professor Frink. His full name was revealed in the Bart Simpson comic series.

===Dolph Shapiro===
Dolph Shapiro, formerly known as Dolph Starbeam (voiced by Tress MacNeille in most appearances, Pamela Hayden in &quot;The Telltale Head&quot; and &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot;) is a bully and student at Springfield Elementary School who is one of Jimbo Jones&#x27; friends. Dolph is recognized by his asymmetrical haircut which covers one eye; he wears cutoff shorts and basketball shoes. He made his first appearance in the episode &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;. In a later episode, it is revealed that he is Jewish and goes to Hebrew School after elementary school, wherein he is preparing for his bar mitzvah, an event held for Jewish boys upon turning 13, although it had been previously established he is 14 years old.

===Drederick Tatum===
Drederick Tatum (voiced by Hank Azaria from season 2 to 31; Jay Pharoah since season 33) has appeared in several episodes. He is a professional boxer and the reigning world heavyweight boxing champion. He features prominently in the episode &quot;The Homer They Fall&quot;, in which Homer takes up boxing and is lined up as an opponent for Tatum, soon to be released from prison. The fight proves one-sided, and Homer is rescued by Moe just as he is about to be knocked unconscious by Tatum. Tatum grew up in Springfield, but in &quot;Flaming Moe&#x27;s&quot; he calls the city &quot;a dump&quot; and says &quot;if you ever see me back there, you know I really [bleeped expletive] up bad.&quot;

The 1984 Olympic gold medalist, he first became world champion after defeating Watson in the heavily promoted &quot;Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out&quot;, a fight Homer and his friends watched on his illegal cable hookup. He was so feared inside prison, he could stop riots just by telling the rioters to &quot;shut up&quot;. Tatum also appears in &quot;Bye Bye Nerdie&quot;, in which Lisa swabs him with nerd sweat, which forces Nelson Muntz to involuntarily get up and start punching Tatum and give him a wedgie, to little effect. A sobbing Nelson tries to apologize, begging him not to punch him, but Tatum rolls up his sleeves and declares &quot;you leave me little recourse&quot;.

Tatum is a parody of Mike Tyson, with a high-pitched, lisping voice, a menacing demeanor, a criminal record, financial problems, and a tendency to speak in a surprisingly formal manner (&quot;I insist that you desist&quot;, &quot;your behavior is unconscionable”). In the episode &quot;Highway to Well&quot;, he even sports a facial tattoo resembling Tyson&#x27;s. He also has an unscrupulous manager named Lucius Sweet who closely resembles Tyson&#x27;s promoter and manager Don King. Indeed, in &quot;The Homer They Fall&quot;, Homer notes that Sweet &quot;is as rich and famous as Don King, and looks just like him&quot;. King and Tyson were asked to appear in the episode, but declined. Paul Winfield, who played King in a 1995 Tyson biopic, took the role instead. Another episode shows him in the role of a shoe company endorser who is extremely candid, describing the shoes as &quot;butt-ugly&quot; before ruefully stating &quot;My forthrightness is my undoing&quot;.

===Duffman===

==E==
===Eddie===
Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; (voiced by Harry Shearer) is one of the Springfield police officers. He first appeared in the first season episode &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot;. Like Lou, he does not have a surname.

In &quot;Bart vs. Thanksgiving&quot;, Eddie was animated to Lou&#x27;s voice and Lou was animated to Eddie&#x27;s.

===Edna Krabappel===
===Elizabeth Hoover===
Elizabeth Hoover (voiced by Maggie Roswell, understudied by Marcia Mitzman Gaven) is a second grade teacher at Springfield Elementary. In early episodes, Miss Hoover seemed proud to have a student as bright as Lisa in her class. However, in later seasons it seems she has been worn down by her years in the public school system and, in &quot;Lisa Gets an &#x27;A&#x27;, implies that she frequently drinks during lunch.

In the episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Substitute&quot;, she thought she had lyme disease. She is very apathetic and bored with her job. She is often seen smoking even while teaching, once even under a &quot;No Smoking&quot; sign in the assembly hall. Her desperate attempts to regain her stability include rushing out of class to recite &quot;Calm blue ocean, calm blue ocean&quot; with her eyes closed, getting into her car and driving off on two occasions, and even letting Ralph teach the class after she was granted tenure and therefore free to do almost anything she wants.

Marcia Mitzman Gaven substituted as Elizabeth Hoover when Maggie Roswell was involved in a pay dispute.

==F==
===Fallout Boy===
In the series, Fallout Boy (alternatively voiced by Dan Castellaneta and Harry Shearer) first appears in a 1950s &quot;Radioactive Man&quot; serial film shown at a comic book convention in the episode &quot;Three Men and a Comic Book&quot;. However, unlike many &quot;Simpsons&quot; characters, he has only made a handful of appearances since. While Radioactive Man is a broad parody of many superheroes, most obviously containing elements of Batman and Superman (and the comic incorporates an origin story similar to Marvel&#x27;s Hulk), among others, Fallout Boy is mainly a parody of Robin (with his costume, references as being the &#x27;young ward&#x27; of Radioactive Man, and his younger age and sidekick status) with elements of Spider-Man (his fictional comic book origin, for example). His catchphrase is &quot;Jiminy Jillickers!&quot;

Fallout Boy also appears in a real-life comic book titled &quot;Radioactive Man&quot;, published by Bongo Comics (a comic created in part by Matt Groening, the creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;). In these comic books, Fallout Boy&#x27;s real name is Rod Runtledge, he has a brother named Dodd. They live in Zenith City. Rod is a high school nerd living with his aunt, Aunt June. Fallout Boy was an average book worm, until one day, he was at a Radioactive demonstration, where he met up with Claude Kane. A tall piece of machinery fell towards them. Claude grabbed Rod and jumped over the rail, Claude holding onto the machine. The machine came to life, and as the ray passed through Claude, who became Radioactive Man, it hit Rod. Rod then got a pint-sized version of Radioactive Man&#x27;s powers and became Fallout Boy.

In the episode &quot;Radioactive Man&quot;, Milhouse was chosen over Bart to play Fallout Boy in the Radioactive Man movie to be filmed in Springfield.

The rock band Fall Out Boy took their name from this character.

===Fat Tony===
===Francesca Terwilliger===
Francesca Terwilliger (voiced by Maria Grazia Cucinotta in &quot;The Italian Bob&quot;, Tress MacNeille in &quot;Funeral for a Friend&quot;) is married to Robert Onderdonk Terwilliger, better known as Sideshow Bob. She first appears in the season 17 episode &quot;The Italian Bob&quot;, when Sideshow Bob moved to Italy to get away from Bart for a fresh start. He became the mayor of a small Tuscan village and married Francesca, with whom he had a son called Gino, although Sideshow Bob never told her, or indeed anyone about his murderous past. However, when the Simpsons visited Italy, Lisa got drunk at a feast and told the whole town of the things he had done. After being thrown out of his village, Bob swore a vendetta against the Simpsons, which Francesca encouraged, saying they brought dishonor to the whole family. She helped her husband try (and fail) to kill them at the Colosseum.

Her second appearance comes in the season 19 episode &quot;Funeral for a Fiend&quot; in which Sideshow Bob fakes his own death in a convoluted plot to kill Bart.

===Frank Grimes===
Franklin &quot;Frank&quot; A. Grimes Sr. (voiced by Hank Azaria), occasionally referred to as &quot;Grimey&quot; much to his displeasure, was a 35-year-old everyman and consummate professional who had struggled through a lifetime of hardship. Grimes makes his only canonical appearance in the series in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; in which he is a new employee at the power plant. Throughout the episode, Grimes&#x27;s professionalism is repeatedly contrasted with Homer Simpson&#x27;s idiocy, gluttony, and laziness, making Grimes increasingly frustrated and angry with Homer. True to the name of the episode, Grimes eventually declares Homer his enemy after his co-worker gets him into serious trouble with his new boss Mr. Burns. After several failed attempts to expose Homer&#x27;s stupidity and irresponsibility, Grimes makes one final attempt by tricking Homer into entering a nuclear power plant design contest intended for kids. After Homer is declared the winner, Grimes snaps, declaring that he can also be as lazy and moronic as Homer, and should be able to get away with it just as Homer does. As he runs amok through the plant, Grimes, declaring that he does not need safety gloves, grabs two high-voltage wires and is fatally electrocuted. As a final inadvertent insult, Homer sleeps through the funeral and amuses the assembled mourners with his insensitivity, who laugh as Grimes&#x27;s coffin is lowered. Grimes has been referenced in several later episodes, first in &quot;Natural Born Kissers&quot;, where Homer finds an old pamphlet to Grimes&#x27;s funeral.

In &quot;Treehouse of Horror XII&quot;, Grimes is one of the faces on the Wailing Wall. His tombstone appears in &quot;Alone Again, Natura-Diddily&quot; and was also kicked by Homer in &quot;My Mother the Carjacker&quot;.

His alleged son Frank Grimes Jr. sought to avenge his father&#x27;s death by killing Homer in &quot;The Great Louse Detective&quot;.

In the non-canon season 28 episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXVII&quot;, the ghost of Frank Grimes appears as part of Sideshow Bob&#x27;s army of the Simpsons&#x27; enemies.

His tombstone can also be seen in the new opening sequence for the show (during the flash through the town from Marge and Maggie in the car to the front of the Simpsons&#x27; house, Ralph Wiggum can be seen playing in the dirt in front of the tombstone).

===Frankie the Squealer===
Frankie the Squealer (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is a mafia member and associate of Fat Tony. However, he does not appear to be very useful to his colleagues in criminal activity due to his uncontrollable habit of squealing. On several occasions, the mob has attempted to kill him for his squealing, though they have repeatedly been unsuccessful. Frankie first appeared in the episode &quot;Insane Clown Poppy&quot; where his squealing habits are introduced after he squeals on himself for squealing.

==G==
===Gil Gunderson===
Gil Gunderson, a.k.a. Ol&#x27; Gil (voiced by Dan Castellaneta), first appeared in the ninth season episode &quot;Realty Bites&quot; as a real estate agent with Lionel Hutz&#x27;s Red Blazer Realty. He is a spoof of actor Jack Lemmon&#x27;s portrayal of Shelley Levene in the 1992 film adaptation of the play &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;. (Lemmon himself voiced a character similar to Levene in the eighth season episode &quot;The Twisted World of Marge Simpson&quot;.) Show runner Mike Scully said that the writers thought that Gil would be &quot;a one-shot thing&quot;. &quot;Castellaneta was so funny at the table read doing the character [that] we kept making up excuses in subsequent episodes to put him in&quot;, Scully said. Writer Dan Greaney said it was a great take-off on Levene to make Gil more desperate than he was. Even so, the writers like to write Gil with &quot;a little bit of the old sparkle&quot; left in him.

Since the retirement of the character Lionel Hutz (after voice actor Phil Hartman&#x27;s death), Gil has been working as the Simpsons&#x27; lawyer in later episodes, though he has appeared in that role much less frequently than Lionel did (most scenes where one of the Simpsons is in court have either made their attorney an anonymous figure or simply ignored him or her). Gil&#x27;s work history includes many unsuccessful sales jobs, a position where he committed theft and was busted by the IRS for it, another job where he lost the entire company payroll at a Las Vegas casino, and a 2009 stint when he was hired by the Springfield Police Department after he was able to free Chief Wiggum after he handcuffed himself to his desk. He always gets fired, often for just being incompetent but sometimes out of bad luck (he lost his job as Santa at Costington&#x27;s when he refused to take back a Malibu Stacey doll, he gave to Lisa so that the CEO&#x27;s granddaughter could have it, and Marge fires him from her Mother Hubbard&#x27;s Sandwich Shop for no real reason). His way of selling is disastrous, as he is usually very unconfident, naturally bumbling, and tends to come off as needy, especially as he almost always refers to himself in the third person, as &quot;Ol&#x27; Gil&quot;. The only time he has been fired for something illegal or on purpose was revealed in the episode &quot;Do Pizza Bots Dream of Electric Guitars&quot;, being arrested (and fired) for drug trafficking cocaine. In &quot;Natural Born Kissers&quot; it was mentioned that Gil lives in a balloon, and he is seen in &quot;Rise of the Guardians&quot; noting that he resides in the city&#x27;s sewer system. In 2006, &quot;Kill Gil, Volumes I &amp; II&quot;, the only episode to center on Gil, won a Writers Guild of America Award in the animation category. It is also revealed in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episodes that he is a grandfather now, and is seen with his granddaughter at daycare. In the Season 34 premiere &quot;Habeas Tortoise&quot;, Gil and Miss Hoover fall in love and get married.

===Gino Terwilliger===
Gino Terwilliger (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is Sideshow Bob and his wife Francesca&#x27;s toddler son. He has the same bizarre hair as his father and his paternal grandmother, as well as the same hatred for Bart Simpson. He first appears in the episode &quot;The Italian Bob&quot;, when Sideshow Bob moved to Italy to start a new life, without anyone knowing, not even his own family, about his murderous history. That is, until Lisa became drunk at a feast and told the whole town everything, even though the Simpson family had promised not to mention anything since Bob fixed their car. The Simpsons flee the town, with Gino and his parents in hot pursuit. When they finally corner the Simpsons at the Colosseum, Gino is seen to be extremely agile and adept with a knife, as well as having a taste for violence; so much so, in fact, that Bob is heard to whisper to Francesca: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to brag, but he&#x27;s evil at an eighth-grade level.&quot; Unfortunately, for him, they were saved by Krusty, who needed some people to help him smuggle antiquities. Gino makes his second appearance in the episode &quot;Funeral for a Fiend&quot;, where it is mentioned that after leaving Italy, he and his parents toured around London for a while before sneaking into America on a train. He, and all of the other members of Bob&#x27;s family played a part in a complicated plan to finish off Bart for good. However, they were foiled by Lisa Simpson and were arrested by Chief Wiggum.

===Gloria===
Gloria Dickson (voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is Snake&#x27;s girlfriend. She is a meter maid. She first appears in &quot;A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love&quot;, dating Mr. Burns. She ends up leaving him to return to her ex-boyfriend Snake. Gloria visits Snake in prison in &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;, and refuses to do whatever he asks of her.

She appears once again in &quot;Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes&quot;, where she is now pregnant. However, in &quot;Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words&quot;, she and Snake have broken up. Then, in &quot;Wedding For Disaster&quot;, Gloria and Snake got back together and apparently got married.

===God===
God (voiced by Harry Shearer) has had many appearances in the series, including &quot;My Way or the Highway to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Homer the Heretic&quot;, &quot;Thank God, It&#x27;s Doomsday&quot;, and &quot;Pray Anything&quot;. He also appears in the opening sequence. He is portrayed in the traditional depiction of the Abrahamic god: a gray-haired man in a white robe with a booming voice. In most episodes, only his beard is seen. One of God&#x27;s distinctive features is that he and Jesus are the only two &quot;The Simpsons&quot; characters drawn with five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot. According to showrunner Al Jean, &quot;&quot;The Simpsons&quot; is one of the few shows on TV where God is not only very real, but he&#x27;s a kind of vengeful Old Testament God.&quot;

===Grady===
Grady Little (voiced by Scott Thompson) is Julio&#x27;s lover. In &quot;Three Gays of the Condo&quot;, Marge finds a note that says she wanted to dump Homer before they get married. This upsets Homer and he finds a new place to live. Julio and Grady needed a third person in the apartment. He agrees to stay with them. Later, Homer loves Marge again; he moves out. Before Homer moved out, it is revealed Grady loves Homer. Homer runs away saying &quot;I will only hurt you!&quot;

Grady and Julio make small appearances in several other episodes.

===Grampa Simpson===
===Groundskeeper Willie===
===Greta Wolfcastle===
Greta Wolfcastle (voiced by Reese Witherspoon in “The Bart Wants What It Wants” and Tress MacNeille in “Treehouse of Horror XXXII”) is the daughter of action movie star Rainier Wolfcastle. She first appeared in &quot;The Bart Wants What It Wants&quot; when Milhouse develops a crush on her, yet Bart goes out on a date with her instead. After Bart decided he was becoming too needy, the two broke up, which causes Milhouse to go back to Canada with Greta &amp; the two get in a fight during a curling game.

===The Grumple===
The Grumple (voiced by Hank Azaria) is a green monster who is an obvious parody of The Grinch. He first appeared as a running gag in &quot;Kill Gil, Volumes I &amp; II&quot;, fighting Homer in various locations. He incidentally appears in many later episodes, attending Lady Gaga&#x27;s concert in &quot;Lisa Goes Gaga&quot;, in a video game in &quot;White Christmas Blues&quot;, he does the Homer Shake, and he was mentioned by Matt Selman in the April 15, 2014 TV Guide article promoting &quot;Brick Like Me&quot; in which he jokes that he will be one of the few Simpsons characters to not be portrayed in Lego form during the episode.

===Gunter and Ernst===
Gunter Schmidt (voiced by Harry Shearer) and Ernst Hammerstein (voiced by Hank Azaria), Las Vegas-style magicians and entertainers, are obvious parodies of Siegfried &amp; Roy: they speak with German accents, their act involves magic and white tigers, and one has black hair while the other has bleached-blond hair. The duo appear in &quot;Viva Ned Flanders&quot;, &quot;$pringfield&quot;, &quot;The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons&quot;, and &quot;Jazzy and the Pussycats&quot;. In &quot;Jazzy and the Pussycats&quot;, they are seen at Amber Simpson&#x27;s funeral. In video game The Simpsons Game, it is revealed they performed at an aquarium.

===Handsome Pete===
Handsome Pete is a one-time character that looks like a miniature Krusty the Clown, and dances for nickels at the pier while playing the concertina. If paid a quarter, he&#x27;ll play for hours - to Captain McCallister&#x27;s dismay. He was featured in season 7 episode 15: &quot;Bart the Fink&quot;.

===Hank Scorpio===
Hank Scorpio (voiced by Albert Brooks) is a one-time character. He is a supervillain who used to be Homer&#x27;s boss when they moved to Cypress Creek in the second episode of season 8, &quot;You Only Move Twice&quot;. He is the owner of &quot;Globex Corporation&quot; and his office is in a volcano. When Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie wanted to go back to Springfield, Homer had to quit while Hank was fighting off the government. Since Homer was a big help, Hank gave him the Denver Broncos in return.

===Hans Moleman===
Hans Moleman (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is the retconned name of an earlier character named &quot;Ralph Melish&quot;. A character similar in appearance is seen briefly in the episode &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;. He was renamed when a writer noticed he looked like a mole man.

A seemingly elderly man, Moleman is sometimes portrayed as a resident of the Springfield Retirement Castle, although in a deleted scene from the episode &quot;Brother from Another Series&quot; he is shown to live in a house under a dam. He has cataracts and is almost entirely blind, which has severely impaired his reading ability and has led to repeated revokings of his driver&#x27;s license. He carries a cane to walk with. Although he appears to be elderly, in fact, Hans Moleman claims to be 31 years old, and that &quot;drinking has ruined [his] life&quot;. He is also the host of a radio program, &quot;Moleman in the Morning&quot;, on Springfield radio station KJAZZ.

In episode 13 of season 26, &quot;Walking Big &amp; Tall&quot;, Hans is revealed to be the former mayor of Springfield, who was briefly banished from Springfield, riding a horse, by the angry townsfolk when Moe Szyslak discovered that a song Moleman had made Springfield&#x27;s city anthem 30 years before was in fact a rip-off of another town&#x27;s anthem and used by other towns.

In 2015, Hans appears as a non-playable character in the toys-to-life video game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;. In game, he only appears in the Simpsons levels and all his voice lines are archive audio from Dan Castellaneta.

His character is based on a character created by Tex Avery, Droopy.

Like many recurring characters, Hans Moleman has had a wide variety of careers over the course of the series. Hans Moleman&#x27;s appearances usually come in the form of a running gag where he is killed by various accidents, yet inexplicably returns unharmed in subsequent episodes. He has been driven off a cliff while hauling Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s house, torched by a solar ray, drilled in the head by Mr. Burns, executed via the electric chair, thrown out of a window, eaten by alligators, sucked up by roombas, buried alive, smothered by a Rover, killed by the Grim Reaper&#x27;s touch of death, drowned after driving his truck off a broken bridge, has had his car explode after bumping into a tree, and has been crushed by various different objects on several occasions. In &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, Homer&#x27;s car runs him over. He has also suffered many non-fatal accidents such as getting hit in the groin by a football during his indie film and crashing his car into the Planet Hype restaurant. In &quot;The Simpsons: Road Rage&quot; opening cutscene, he gets horrifically irradiated by the Burns Atomic Mega-bus.

===The Happy Little Elves===
The Happy Little Elves are a parody of The Smurfs, who appeared more often in the show&#x27;s earlier episodes, e.g. watched on videocassette in &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;. They are a favorite of Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Bart, however, hates them; he mainly refers to them as either &quot;those stupid elves&quot;, &quot;The Crappy Little Elves&quot;, or &quot;The Little Green Idiots&quot;. Their movies include &quot;Return of The Happy Little Elves&quot;, an unnamed Christmas movie as seen in &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;, &quot;The Happy Little Elves Meet The Curious Bear Cubs&quot; (&quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;), &quot;The Happy Little Elves in Tinkly Winkly Town&quot;, and &quot;The Happy Little Elves meet Fuzzy Snuggleduck&quot; (which was listed as an R-rated movie along with &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; and &quot;The Erotic Awakening of S&quot; on Rancho Relaxo&#x27;s cable system). They were first mentioned in a short on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; entitled &quot;Scary Movie&quot;. The most recent appearance they had was in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Adventures Through the Windshield Glass&quot; in 2023. In more current episodes, they appear as wall decorations in Maggie&#x27;s and Lisa&#x27;s rooms. They were also seen in The Simpsons Ride.

===Helen Lovejoy===

Helen Lovejoy (née Schwartzbaum; voiced by Maggie Roswell; understudied by Marcia Mitzman Gaven in &quot;Tennis the Menace&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; to Praiseland&quot; and &quot;Large Marge&quot; while Roswell was in a pay dispute) is Rev. Lovejoy&#x27;s judgmental and gossipy wife, and the mother of Jessica Lovejoy. She introduced herself in the episode &quot;Life on the Fast Lane&quot; as &quot;the gossipy wife of the minister&quot;. Her catchphrase is &quot;What about the children?! Won&#x27;t somebody &quot;please&quot; think of the children!?&quot; which she always says among a crowd when something bad is happening in the city. In &quot;Wedding for Disaster&quot;, the Parson implies Helen is a transgender woman who used to be named Harold Schwartzbaum. In &quot;E Pluribus Wiggum&quot;, it is revealed that Helen is a Republican (she is seen at the Springfield Republican meeting, which takes place in a scary castle atop a hill). In the non-canon &quot;Treehouse of Horror XX&quot; story, &quot;Don&#x27;t Have a Cow, Mankind&quot;, Helen is Lisa&#x27;s godmother. She also serves as an antagonist to Marge Simpson as she usually is the one who opposes or antagonizes her. While in her extrovert &quot;Belladonna&quot; personality she displayed bisexual tendencies, inviting Marge to join her and Timothy&#x27;s tryst - albeit unaware that it&#x27;s Marge&#x27;s voice she can hear.

===Herman Hermann===
Herman Hermann (voiced by Harry Shearer) is the one-armed owner of Herman&#x27;s Military Antiques. In reply to a question by Bart, he insinuates that he lost his arm when he stuck it out the window of a school bus. In the episode &quot;To Cur with Love&quot;, he is seen in a flashback losing his arm hitchhiking when he is sideswiped by an animal control van. A brilliant military tactician, Herman was instrumental in Bart&#x27;s victory in water balloon combat against Nelson and in the negotiation of the peace treaty between the two combatants in &quot;Bart the General&quot;, which is his first and most significant appearance.

Herman is often portrayed as a crook, having sold Abraham Simpson a fez by falsely claiming it was previously owned by Napoleon; Herman then advertised Abe&#x27;s old hat as &quot;the hat McKinley was shot in&quot;. He also tried to sell counterfeit jeans out of the Simpsons&#x27; garage, but was foiled by Marge Simpson in &quot;The Springfield Connection&quot;. In a parody of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; he once captured Chief Wiggum and Snake and held them hostage, but was accidentally knocked unconscious by Milhouse with a medieval flail, rescuing them. He is always seen as a somewhat dangerous character, dressing in military fatigues, and speaking in a slow, gravelly voice (he is also often seen with an unlit cigarette in his mouth). In the opening credits of a later episode the billboard reads, &#x27;Herman&#x27;s Military Antiques (and guns)&#x27;. It is revealed and mentioned at various points that he keeps a loaded shotgun under the counter, and has various other firearms at his disposal.

Harry Shearer does an impression of George H. W. Bush for the voice. Herman&#x27;s facial appearance is modeled after &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer John Swartzwelder. The original idea behind Herman, said Groening, was that each time he appeared, he would give a different explanation for how he lost his arm. However, the second joke, involving Herman having stuck his arm in a ball return at a bowling alley, got cut, and the writers never pursued the idea until &quot;To Cur with Love&quot;.

===Homer Simpson===

==J==
===Dr. J. Loren Pryor===
Dr. J. Loren Pryor (voiced by Harry Shearer) is the school psychologist. He is based on an early design for Seymour Skinner and first appears in &quot;Bart the Genius&quot; where he decides to send Bart to a school for gifted children after Bart cheats on a test. Bart later approaches him to request returning to Springfield Elementary.

In &quot;Bart Gets an &#x27;F&#x27;, he tells him that if Bart does not shape up, he may have to repeat the fourth grade.

He appears again, discussing Bart&#x27;s problems at school and Lisa&#x27;s special gift in a flashback sequence of &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Sax&quot;. In this episode he also inadvertently reveals that Milhouse Van Houten possesses &quot;flamboyantly homosexual&quot; tendencies. Pryor does not appear again for several years until the episode &quot;See Homer Run&quot;, in which he tells Lisa that she is going through a developmental condition. Jon Vitti named the character for his prying into the children&#x27;s lives.

===Jack Marley===
Jack Marley (voiced by Dan Castellaneta with a voice resembling Droopy Dog) is a former worker at the Nuclear Plant who was forced to retire with a lavish retirement party. He tries to get out of it by saying his job was all he had, since he never married and his dog died, but Mr. Burns&#x27; hired goons throw him out anyway. He is seen in &quot;Marge in Chains&quot; at the court as the foreman of Marge&#x27;s trial.

Jack is later seen in &quot;Simpson Tide&quot; mopping the floor and informs Homer he is off the hook when all the Naval Judges leave, having been indicted in various scandals. He possibly lives in the Retirement Castle and is rarely seen in the series.

===Jamshed Nahasapeemapetilon===
Jamshed &quot;Jay&quot; Nahasapeemapetilon (voiced by Nancy Cartwright as a child, Utkarsh Ambudkar as a young adult) is Apu&#x27;s nephew and Sanjay&#x27;s son. His first appearance is in &quot;Homer the Heretic&quot;, when he is left in charge of the Kwik-E-Mart alone, he pulls out a gun, scaring Jimbo, Kearney and Dolph.

In &quot;Much Apu About Something&quot;, he is a young adult and is now called &quot;Jay&quot;. After Sanjay retires, he gives his share of the store to Jay and turns the Kwik-E-Mart into a healthy food market called Quick &amp; Fresh.

===Janey Powell===
Janey Powell (voiced by Pamela Hayden from 1990 to 2020, Maggie Roswell in &quot;Bart the Daredevil&quot;, Tress MacNeille in &quot;The Burns Cage&quot;, Kimberly Brooks since 2022) is a classmate and friend of Lisa Simpson. Janey first appeared in &quot;Moaning Lisa&quot; and is Lisa&#x27;s closest friend. She has been at Lisa&#x27;s sleepovers, and Lisa is seen watching cartoons at her house on numerous occasions. Her description on The Simpsons POG set described her as &quot;Lisa&#x27;s fair-weather friend&quot;. Though she is sometimes seen spending time with Lisa, other times she teases her along with the other children. She is not portrayed as being nearly as intelligent or nerdy as Lisa. Janey may have had a crush on Milhouse Van Houten, who has a crush on Lisa. She enjoys reading, babysitting, books, and she hates ice cream.

===Jasper Beardsley===
Jasper Beardsley (voiced by Harry Shearer) is one of the older residents of Springfield, often portrayed as Abraham Simpson&#x27;s best friend. They have been friends since their youth, as seen in &quot;$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)&quot;. His most distinguishing features are his ultra-low, gravelly voice and very long and hard beard. Jasper made his first appearance in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;. He is a veteran of World War II, but (according to the episode &quot;Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play&quot;) he attempted to avoid the draft by disguising himself as a woman. He stayed in Springfield to play in the local women&#x27;s baseball league, along with his friend Abe, who was also avoiding the war but was exposed during a game. In a deleted scene, it was shown that Jasper was the town pastor, prior to Reverend Lovejoy. He briefly served as substitute teacher of Lisa&#x27;s class during which time he confiscated everything made of tin, got his beard caught in a pencil sharpener and threatened paddling for minor infractions such as looking out the window, talking out of turn or staring at his sandals.

In the subplot of the season nine episode, &quot;Lisa the Simpson&quot;, Jasper put himself in crude &quot;suspended animation&quot; in the Kwik-E-Mart&#x27;s freezer, and under advice from Dr. Nick, Apu kept him frozen. When Jasper&#x27;s frozen form became popular with customers, Apu started exploiting the spectacle, and transformed the Kwik-E-Mart into a special interest store dealing with weird items, or perfectly ordinary ones which had been made out to be abnormal, called the Freak-E-Mart. Jasper was accidentally unfrozen, and stepped out into what he thought was a future world, just as Apu was considering selling him to the Rich Texan. In the episode &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; Jasper mentions he is a diabetic (which would explain why he has a wooden leg, as seen in part two of the &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns&quot; two-parter, though past episodes, such as &quot;Boy Scoutz &#x27;n the Hood&quot;, &quot;A Streetcar Named Marge&quot;, and &quot;The PTA Disbands&quot; all show that Jasper&#x27;s legs are real).

In &quot;The Simpsons Super Spectacular #13&quot;, published by Bongo Comics, it is revealed that in the &#x27;60s, Jasper was part of a group called &#x27;the League of Superheroes&#x27;, under the name Super Jasper. He fought crime alongside the Komedian (Krusty the Clown), Betty Firecrocker (Jacqueline Bouvier), and the original Pie Man (Abraham Simpson).

===Jay Sherman===
Jay Sherman (voiced by Jon Lovitz) is a film critic who was the main character of &quot;The Critic&quot;. In &quot;A Star is Burns&quot;, he came to Springfield to be a judge during the film festival. In &quot;Hurricane Neddy&quot;, he was a patient at the Calmwood Mental Hospital. He also apparently became a regular patron to Moe&#x27;s Tavern as is seen in &quot;The Ziff Who Came to Dinner&quot;.

Sherman was originally the main character on &quot;The Critic&quot;, which was created by Al Jean and Mike Reiss.

His appearance in &quot;A Star is Burns&quot; was a crossover to promote &quot;The Critic&quot; which made its FOX debut after the episode following its time on ABC. &quot;The Critic&quot; was later canceled.

===Jebediah Springfield===
Jebediah Obadiah Zachariah Jedediah Springfield (a.k.a. Hans Sprungfeld; voiced by Harry Shearer in later appearances, Hank Azaria in &quot;McMansion &amp; Wife&quot;) is the founder of the town of Springfield. According to legend, Jebediah Springfield and his partner Shelbyville Manhattan led a band that left Maryland in search of &quot;New Sodom&quot; due to a misinterpretation of the Bible, but they parted ways over political differences: though both men are devoted to chastity and abstinence, Manhattan wanted to let people be free to marry their cousins if they wish, which Springfield strongly opposed. It was then that Manhattan went on to found the rival town of Shelbyville, taking half of the settlers with him.

Springfield had many famous quotations, such as &quot;A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man&quot;. He also wears a coonskin cap. The Springfield Marathon commemorates an occasion on which he ran across six states to avoid his creditors. In &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;, Bart beheaded the statue, thinking that this would make him more popular. In reality, the town became depressed and angry, leaving Bart to endure &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;-style guilt before putting it back on. This episode is referenced in multiple &quot;Simpsons&quot; video games such as &quot;The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants&quot;, where the statue&#x27;s head serves as a power-up item, or &quot;The Simpsons: Road Rage&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run&quot;, where characters can kick or ram Jebediah&#x27;s head off the statue. This was also referenced in the 2009–present opening sequence used since the twentieth season.

Many Jebediah legends have been debunked during the run of the series. For instance, &quot;The Telltale Head&quot; repeatedly refers to Jebediah killing a bear with his bare hands, but on the news, Kent Brockman reveals that recent historical evidence suggests the bear actually killed Jebediah. On a field trip to Springfield&#x27;s historic &quot;Olde Springfield Towne&quot;, Bart uncovers other inconsistencies in the Jebediah legend, such as that he fought at Fort Ticonderoga the same day as the first Whacking Day; it turned out that Whacking Day only began in 1924 as an excuse to beat up the Irish.

Most of Springfield&#x27;s biography is revealed in the 1996 episode &quot;Lisa the Iconoclast&quot;, wherein Lisa Simpson discovers Jebediah Springfield&#x27;s biggest secret: he was formerly a bloodthirsty pirate named Hans Sprungfeld, who once brawled with George Washington and lost after Washington crushed Sprungfeld&#x27;s genitals in one of his sets of iron false teeth. Sprungfeld fled and changed his name in 1795 to hide his identity. He was well known for his &quot;silver tongue&quot; (literally; a metal prosthetic tongue, his original tongue having been bitten off by a Turkish pirate in a grog house fight). Before he died of diphtheria, he wrote his confession on a scrap of canvas that he hid in a fife. The canvas scrap formed the &quot;missing piece&quot; of the famously incomplete 1796 Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington; Sprungfeld picked it up during a fight against Washington which occurred while the latter was having his portrait painted. Lisa decides not to reveal this secret to the people of Springfield, seeing that the myth of Jebediah has brought out the good in everyone and that the true story will cause them to lose hope and morale within themselves.

===Jimbo Jones===
Corky James &quot;Jimbo&quot; Jones (voiced by Tress MacNeille in &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;, &quot;When Flanders Failed&quot;, &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot;, &quot;Lisa on Ice&quot;, &quot;Lisa the Skeptic&quot; and &quot;The Joy of Sect&quot;, Pamela Hayden in later episodes) is a bully at Springfield Elementary who wears a purple knit cap and a black T-shirt emblazoned with a menacing skull. He is a sixth-grader and is often seen hanging out with Dolph, Kearney, and sometimes Nelson. He made his first appearance in the episode &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;. He is acknowledged as the leader of the gang of bullies in Nelson&#x27;s absence. He enjoys intimidating his schoolmates and shoplifting. It is hinted that he comes from a well-off family, most notably in season six&#x27;s &quot;The PTA Disbands&quot; when—with the school closed for a teacher&#x27;s strike—he and his mother watch soap operas and sip tea together in a well-furnished living room. In season four&#x27;s &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot;, he briefly dates Laura Powers until she leaves him for crying in front of Moe after Bart exposed his true personality by prank-calling him.

In season seven&#x27;s &quot;Bart the Fink&quot;, Bart discovers that Jimbo&#x27;s real name is Corky.

In &quot;Beware My Cheating Bart&quot;, it is revealed that he is bald on top, with hair around it. Jimbo&#x27;s other known aliases are Jamesbo, Dr. J and Hector Gutierrez. In season eighteen&#x27;s &quot;24 Minutes&quot; it is revealed that his mother&#x27;s name is Carol. Jimbo is a portmanteau nickname for executive producer James L. Brooks. Jimbo runs for mayor in the Season 17 episode &quot;See Homer Run&quot;, with a campaign slogan of &quot;Tough on Nerds. Tougher on Dorks&quot;.

===Johnny Tightlips===
Jonathan &quot;Johnny Tightlips&quot; Schmallippe (voiced by Hank Azaria) born Giovanni Silencio, is a Springfield Mafia gangster who is the second-in-command of Fat Tony. He usually says very little, for fear of being accused of being a &quot;squealer,&quot; but his reticence is so extreme it backfires, becoming unhelpful to everyone, including Fat Tony and himself. However, in recent episodes, he &quot;does&quot;, sometimes, elaborate whenever he feels like it, just as long he as he doesn&#x27;t say too much.

In his debut episode &quot;Insane Clown Poppy,&quot; there is a shootout in Fat Tony&#x27;s mansion and Johnny was shot by accident. When the shootout ended, Louie, one of Fat Tony&#x27;s capos, then asked in concern to Johnny on where he is injured, resulting Johnny to say, &quot;I ain&#x27;t sayin&#x27; nuthin&#x27;!&quot;, and when Louie asked in concern on what he, himself, will tell the doctor, Johnny, again in his usual reticent nature, says, &quot;Tell him to suck a lemon.&quot; Afterwards, he then officially became a supporting minor character working for Fat Tony and the Mafia in the series, starting in the Season 13 episode, &quot;Poppa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Badge.&quot;

===Jub-Jub===
Jub-Jub is Selma Bouvier&#x27;s pet iguana and was originally owned by Aunt Gladys. He was first seen in &quot;Selma&#x27;s Choice&quot;. Gladys gives Jub-Jub to Jacqueline Bouvier, who is highly unattached to him. As a result, she later passes him on to Selma. Selma once said that Jub-Jub will eat her remains after she dies. The name Jub-Jub was coined by then-writer Conan O&#x27;Brien. He often said nonsensical things around the office for no apparent reason, one of which was &quot;Jub-Jub&quot; (There is, however, a Jubjub bird in &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot;).

Fans of Sports Radio 1310 in Dallas voted that Jub-Jub be the new nickname of morning radio host George Dunham. O&#x27;Brien, on October 17, 2007, mentioned his creation of Jub Jub and asked Joe Buck, the play-by-play commentator of the MLB World Series on FOX, to say it during his broadcast. O&#x27;Brien promised $1,000 to the charity of the announcer&#x27;s choice. On October 24, 2007, during Game 1 of the 2007 World Series, Buck called field level reporter, Chris Myers, &quot;our own little Jub-Jub&quot;. Jub-Jub was used as the first Twitter hash tag for O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour&quot; in 2010.

===Judge Constance Harm===
Judge Constance Harm (voiced by Jane Kaczmarek) is a harsh, unforgiving judge and disciplinarian. She enjoys creating cruel punishments for criminals in her court and frightening them with a miniature guillotine on the bench. Her name is a play on &quot;constant harm&quot;. In &quot;The Parent Rap&quot;, she says &quot;When I was a little boy,&quot; revealing that she is transgender. The character is a parody of Judge Judy Sheindlin.

In &quot;On a Clear Day I Can&#x27;t See My Sister&quot;, she reveals she has a husband. Although Judge Snyder resolves court cases, Judge Harm has mainly been used for handing down negative verdicts such as sentencing a family member to prison. She also appears in &quot;Brawl in the Family&quot;, &quot;Barting Over&quot;, &quot;The Wandering Juvie&quot;, &quot;Brake My Wife, Please&quot;, &quot;Chief of Hearts&quot;, and &quot;One Angry Lisa&quot;.

===Judge Snyder===
Judge Roy Snyder (voiced by Harry Shearer in season 2 to 32, Kevin Michael Richardson since season 36) is a Springfield judge known for his lenient punishments and somewhat unorthodox rulings (as in the episode &quot;Sweets and Sour Marge&quot; when he bans sugar from Springfield).

Lionel Hutz once described his problem with Judge Snyder in the episode &quot;Marge in Chains&quot;: Well, he&#x27;s had it in for me ever since I kinda ran over his dog... Well, replace the word &quot;kinda&quot; with the word &quot;repeatedly&quot; and the word &quot;dog&quot; with &quot;son&quot;.

The character was originally named &quot;Judge Moulton&quot; (as mentioned in the episode &quot;Bart Gets Hit by a Car&quot;), but show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein did not know that, and called him &quot;Snyder&quot;. His appearance is modeled on Robert Bork. Snyder&#x27;s skin color has gone back and forth between yellow and brown repeatedly throughout the series. His skin is currently brown.

===Julio===
Julio Franco (voiced by Hank Azaria from season 14 to 31, Tony Rodriguez since season 32, singing voice provided by Mario Jose) is a gay man who is attracted to Grady, although Grady breaks up with him. He is employed as a hairdresser. According to &quot;Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind&quot;, Julio is from Costa Rica, though this is contradicted in &quot;The Burns Cage&quot; which states he is from Cuba. He later married Tada, and has an affair with Duffman. He also is a photographer and takes photos of Marge and her friends. He is seen attending First Church of Springfield. In the episode &quot;E Pluribus Wiggum&quot;, he attends a Democratic Party meeting. In &quot;The Burns Cage&quot; he starts dating Smithers, but breaks up with him after realizing that Smithers is still in love with Mr. Burns.

===Dr. Julius Hibbert===
===Just Stamp the Ticket Man===
&quot;Just Stamp the Ticket&quot; Man (voiced by Hank Azaria) appeared in a number of earlier episodes, but was never named. This man first appears in &quot;When Flanders Failed&quot; when he goes to the Leftorium to get his parking validated because it is the only store that does it without requiring a purchase. Ned Flanders says he is &quot;right as rain, or, as we say around here, left as rain&quot; but the man bluntly responds &quot;Just stamp the ticket&quot;. His next appearance is in &quot;Homer Alone&quot;, when the Squeaky Voiced Teen tries to hand him a flyer, he brushes him off by saying &quot;Don&#x27;t touch me&quot;. In a later episode, &quot;Mr. Plow&quot;, he tells Barney Gumble (who is handing out flyers dressed as Lullabuy$&#x27;s Big Baby) that he &quot;sickens&quot; him. He reappears again in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Barbershop Quartet&quot;, at the Springfield Swap Meet, he derides Marge&#x27;s &quot;cool&quot; wishbone necklaces, stating he doubted his &quot;son or daughter is that stupid&quot;. The character also appears in the episodes &quot;Homer Loves Flanders&quot; (who tells Homer that, if Homer actually went to work for eight days instead of camping out outside the ticket window for football tickets, he would have earned enough to get his tickets from a scalper), &quot;Homer and Apu&quot; (as one of the angry customers in the beginning of the episode), &quot;Bart of Darkness&quot; (in which he punched a hippie for singing &quot;Sunshine on My Shoulders&quot; during a town-wide heat wave) and &quot;Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy&quot; (in which he punches Homer in the face for questioning his ability to sexually satisfy his wife). In &quot;Simpson Tide&quot; he has his biggest appearance as the Naval Reserve recruiter who begs Homer not to read the &quot;Are you a homosexual?&quot; question on the application due to the &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; policy that was in effect at the time.

==K==
===Kang and Kodos===
===Kearney Zzyzwicz===
Kearney Zzyzwicz ( , voiced by Nancy Cartwright) is one of Springfield Elementary&#x27;s many bullies. He is a 5th grader and has a buzz cut. He wears a torn white T-shirt, blue shorts, and studded wristbands. He made his first appearance in the episode &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;. Although he looks and sounds to be around Jimbo and Dolph&#x27;s age, Kearney is actually older (a latter-day episode revealed that Kearney is 19 years old, though, according to his voice actress, Nancy Cartwright, Kearney is actually 14). He is the only Springfield Elementary School student who remembers the Watergate scandal and the 1976 Bicentennial (according to Principal Skinner), was in the third-grade class of Otto the bus driver (according to Otto), owns a car (even though he rode the school bus on &quot;A Milhouse Divided&quot;, &quot;The Mook, the Chef, the Wife, and Her Homer&quot;, and &quot;How the Test Was Won&quot;), regularly shaves, has custody of a child from a divorce, is old enough to vote in a general U.S. election, was sent to prison (though &quot;Marge Be Not Proud&quot; and &quot;Lisa the Skeptic&quot; depicted Kearney in juvenile hall), and pays taxes.

In &quot;She of Little Faith&quot;, it is revealed that Kearney dated Jimbo&#x27;s mother, Carol. In the same episode, it is revealed that he is on the church council of the First Church of Springfield and is &quot;a teenager and the parent of a teenager&quot; (implying that the son he introduced in &quot;A Milhouse Divided&quot; may also be older than his outward appearance, though past episodes also imply that Kearney is not a teenager). Despite being of the legal age in the United States to purchase and drink it (as seen in &quot;El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer&quot;), Kearney often relies on (or tricks) Homer into procuring alcohol for him and his friends, as seen in &quot;The Springfield Connection&quot; when Homer tells Marge that he is double-parked because he is buying beer for &quot;those kids over there&quot;, &quot;Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious&quot; when Kearney applies for the nanny job and Homer tells him that he keeps some Schnapps in Maggie&#x27;s crib, and &quot;Last Tap Dance in Springfield&quot;, in which Kearney tricks Homer into driving him, Dolph, and Jimbo to the liquor store to buy Jack Daniels and &quot;a carton of smokes&quot; by impersonating Marge, and once used a fake ID (which Apu overlooked, as he was too depressed about being deported to care that Kearney was committing a crime—and ultimately asked him about getting one for himself—as seen in &quot;Much Apu About Nothing&quot;).

Kearney&#x27;s last name (Zzyzwicz) was revealed in a computer file in season 18&#x27;s &quot;24 Minutes&quot;. Prior to that episode, Kearney&#x27;s surname was never mentioned. Kearney&#x27;s newly revealed last name implies that he may be of Polish descent, or may also be inspired by the town of Zzyzx. In &quot;Bart Gets a &#x27;Z&#x27;, he can be seen sitting in the back row of Bart&#x27;s classroom, implying Kearney is a fourth grader. His father was shown on the season eight episode &quot;The Homer They Fall&quot;, but in &quot;O Brother, Where Bart Thou?&quot;, Kearney reveals that both his parents are incarcerated and they only meet when the prison and insane asylum have their annual mixer.

===Kearney Zzyzwicz Jr.===
Kearney Zzyzwicz Jr. (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) is the son of Kearney. He first appeared in &quot;A Milhouse Divided&quot; in the school bus when Kearney was mentioning his divorce, after that having recurring minor appearances throughout the series.

===Kent Brockman===
===Kirk Van Houten===
Kirk Evelyn Van Houten (voiced by Hank Azaria) is the father of Milhouse, and the remarried husband (and cousin) of Luann Van Houten. He is friends with Homer Simpson. Kirk bears a striking resemblance to his wife, and wears glasses just like her and their son. He first appeared in the season 3 episode &quot;Bart&#x27;s Friend Falls in Love&quot;, but it would not be until season eight&#x27;s &quot;A Milhouse Divided&quot; that Kirk was portrayed as a stereotypical middle-aged male loser and deadbeat dad. Much of his character revolves around his extreme emotional depression after his divorce from his wife Luann. Luann got custody of Milhouse when they divorced, but Kirk has visiting rights and is often seen with Milhouse in later episodes. The Van Houtens got back together in season 17&#x27;s Milhouse of Sand and Fog and officially remarried in the nineteenth season episode &quot;Little Orphan Millie&quot;. In that episode it was established that Kirk is of Dutch ancestry on his father&#x27;s side and has a feud with the members of the family that have a Danish ancestry. Kirk previously served in the U.S. Army, and attended Gudger College. Kirk&#x27;s mother apparently is of Greek ancestry, based on the nineteenth-season episode &quot;Husbands and Knives&quot;, in which Milhouse says, &quot;But that&#x27;s the money Yiayia Sophia gave me for Greek Orthodox Easter!&quot;

According to Luann, Kirk was not a very good provider, and she had to borrow money from her sister to make ends meet and steal donated clothes from the town&#x27;s church so she could have a wardrobe. When Luann demands a divorce, Kirk is all too happy to oblige. Unfortunately, he loses his middle-management job at Southern Cracker, a job given to him by Luann&#x27;s father, as a result. Kirk briefly attempts a career as a singer-songwriter, recording a demo tape of an original song titled &quot;Can I Borrow A Feeling&quot;, with mediocre results. Later, he attempts to get back together with Luann by singing the song to her. Luann does not reciprocate Kirk&#x27;s feelings.

Kirk reveals in &quot;I Am Furious (Yellow)&quot;, in which he visits his son&#x27;s school on career day, that he was currently employed as an assistant to the guy who puts fliers under people&#x27;s windshield wipers. Kirk also had a job standing on the curb holding a sign directing people to a condo development and worked as a scarecrow protecting a soy-bean crop, which resulted in his eye being gouged by a crow. Since being fired from the cracker company, Kirk seems to be unable to maintain a steady job. He once shouted at Luann that she had to keep up the alimony payments she owed him, and he has been seen at the Springfield unemployment office, perhaps suggesting that alimony and unemployment benefits are his only steady sources of income. Kirk was put in jail in the episode &quot;Pranksta Rap&quot; for &quot;kidnapping&quot; Bart which he greatly enjoyed due to him being envied by women and fed three meals a day. In &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, Kirk is briefly seen attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

Azaria has stated that Kirk&#x27;s voice is &quot;a bad Milhouse impression&quot;.

===Krusty the Clown===
===Kumiko Albertson===
Kumiko Albertson (née Nakamura) (voiced by Tress MacNeille from season 25 to 31, Jenny Yokobori since season 32) is a Japanese manga fan and artist from Osaka, Japan. Kumiko first appears in &quot;Married to the Blob&quot; when she walked past Comic Book Guy&#x27;s shop, but stopped when she saw him through the window and liked him. Kumiko and Comic Book Guy get married in the Android&#x27;s Dungeon. Often in her appearances in the series, she is seen next to Comic Book Guy. In &quot;Springfield Splendor&quot;, she finds Lisa&#x27;s art therapy drawings, and sells them at The Android&#x27;s Dungeon as a graphic novel, called &quot;Sad Girl&quot;.

==L==
===Legs and Louie===
Legs (voiced by Hank Azaria from 1991 to 1995, 1998 and 2003, Harry Shearer since 1995, Karl Wiedergott in &quot;Trilogy of Error&quot; and &quot;Chief of Hearts&quot;) and Louie (voiced by Dan Castellaneta in most episodes, Harry Shearer in &quot;Mayored to the Mob&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; to Praiseland&quot; and &quot;Chief of Hearts&quot;) are two gangsters and members of the Springfield Mafia who accompany Fat Tony at all times. The two lack any real definitive characteristic and are almost always seen together. Legs has a dark blonde short haircut and raspy voice. Louie has a slight black afro and a more high-pitched, even squeaky tone. Castellaneta based the voice on actor Joe Pesci, one of the several references to &quot;Goodfellas&quot; used in the episode &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot;. Louie says that tear gas is &quot;[his] one weakness&quot;, though this is likely an embellishment. Dan Castellaneta was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 2011 for the voice of Louie, Homer Simpson, Barney Gumble, and Krusty the Clown thanks to the episode &quot;Donnie Fatso&quot;.

===Lenny Leonard===
Lenford &quot;Lenny&quot; Leonard (voiced by Harry Shearer) is friends with Carl Carlson, Homer Simpson, Moe Szyslak, and Barney Gumble. Although he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and possesses a master&#x27;s degree in nuclear physics, he is often portrayed as a blue-collar working man.

Lenny appears to be well liked by the Simpson family; on one occasion, Marge and the kids build a prayer shrine for him when thinking he was hospitalized in &quot;Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder.&quot; In &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot;, the Simpson family has a cake inscribed &quot;Happy Labor Day Lenny&quot;. In &quot;Pranksta Rap&quot;, it is revealed Marge has a picture of Lenny in her hair.

Lenny&#x27;s full name has not been treated with consistency. After years of being identified only as &quot;Lenny&quot;, Homer addressed him as &quot;Lenford&quot; in the season 13 episode &quot;The Frying Game&quot;, and Lisa addressed him as &quot;Mr. Leonard&quot; in the season 15 episode &quot;The Ziff Who Came To Dinner&quot;. This would appear to make his full name &quot;Lenford Leonard&quot;—but Bart addresses him as &quot;Lenny Lenford&quot; in the season 23 episode &quot;At Long Last Leave&quot;.

Lenny and Carl are best friends, as they are rarely seen apart; their other friends are Homer, and regulars at Moe&#x27;s including Barney Gumble and Moe Szyslak. Homer repeatedly confuses Lenny and Carl, and is shocked to learn on one occasion that Lenny is white, and Carl is black. To guide himself, Homer has &quot;Lenny = White, Carl = Black&quot; on his hand. He once muttered to himself, &quot;Is that right?&quot; while reading it. In &quot;Helter Shelter&quot;, Homer exclaims, &quot;That&#x27;s Lenny? I wanted the black one!&quot; When Mr. Burns appears on a radio show in an attempt to boost his popularity in &quot;Monty Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, Homer tells him that he has a list of jokes explaining the differences between white and black people; Homer later states, &quot;White guys have names like Lenny, whereas black guys have names like Carl.&quot;

Lenny and Carl work at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant alongside Homer Simpson. Despite his steady job, Lenny has been featured with several other jobs. On one occasion, he is promoted to head of the power plant when Mr. Burns goes bankrupt; which Smithers later describes to Homer Simpson as a &quot;reign of terror&quot;. Homer considers Lenny to be the second richest man he knows. However, Lenny is once shown living in a dilapidated house, and asks Marge not to tell anyone how he lives. In one episode, he also works at a call center for the power company in Springfield. In another episode, he is shown living in a fancy, well-furnished modern apartment that happens to share a wall with a Jai-alai court. In a &quot;future episode&quot;, it is shown Lenny is once again in charge of the power plant. On one occasion, it is implied he is an undercover agent whose target is Homer. At the Adult Education Annex, Lenny teaches a class on &quot;How To Chew Tobacco&quot;. In one of Homer&#x27;s daydreams, it is shown that Lenny is the President of the United States.

Lenny and Carl together rank sixth on IGN&#x27;s Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters.

===Leopold===
Leopold John (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is Superintendent Chalmers&#x27; personal assistant. He is a large, surly, snarling man who frequently speaks through clenched teeth, and is one of the few characters on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; to have eyebrows. When Principal Skinner has to be temporarily replaced in the episode &quot;Sweet Seymour Skinner&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot;, Leopold stomps in, issues several threats, and terrifies the children by making them think he is the replacement, and then suddenly politely introduces the actual substitute, Ned Flanders. The children then collectively sigh with relief. The gag was repeated when Marge Simpson becomes a substitute teacher in the episode &quot;The PTA Disbands&quot;. Leopold often refers to the children of Springfield Elementary as &quot;little freaks&quot;.

===Lewis===
Lewis Clark (voiced by Jo Ann Harris in 4 episodes, Nancy Cartwright in 7 episodes, Pamela Hayden in 2 episodes, Russi Taylor in 3 episodes, Tress MacNeille in 5 episodes, Kevin Michael Richardson in &quot;Marge the Lumberjill&quot;, Kimberly Brooks since 2021) is an African-American character and one of Bart&#x27;s friends and classmates at Springfield Elementary School. He can be seen playing the bassoon in the opening sequence of the show. He is usually seen with his best friend Richard. Although one of the most minor characters in the show, Lewis was shown in earlier seasons as part of Bart&#x27;s main circle of friends, although his time lessened as the series progressed. Despite this, Lewis still appears frequently in scenes involving the Springfield children, and occasionally speaks. While Lewis has never had significant dialogue, he has been voiced by various characters throughout the series. Lewis&#x27;s seeming insignificance to the show is underscored in the episode &quot;Das Bus&quot;, in which Bart mistakenly calls him &quot;Wendell&quot;. When corrected, Bart replies, &quot;Just tell Wendell I said bye.&quot;

===Lindsey Naegle===
Lindsey Naegle (voiced by Tress MacNeille) first appeared in the eighth season episode &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot;. In that episode, she had no name and was known only as &quot;The Generic Female TV Executive&quot;. She appeared again in &quot;Girly Edition&quot;, also as a generic female TV executive (only her hair and facial features differed from her first appearance).

In &quot;They Saved Lisa&#x27;s Brain&quot;, she was introduced as &quot;Lindsey Naegle&quot;, a member of the Springfield Chapter of Mensa, and has since become a recurring character. The writers modeled Naegle on a number of network executives that they have encountered while working on the show.

The character&#x27;s surname comes from Hollywood talent agent Sue Naegle, president of HBO Entertainment and wife of &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer Dana Gould. Writer Matt Selman chose the first name &quot;Lindsey&quot; because he thought it sounded like the name of an annoyingly talkative woman. Naegle-like characters have appeared throughout the series, such as the OmniTouch Rep from &quot;Make Room for Lisa&quot; and Laramie executive Mindy from &quot;E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)&quot;. In &quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot;, she readily explains that she frequently changes jobs because she is a sexual predator. Chris Turner, author of the book &quot;Planet Simpson&quot;, called Naegle &quot;an excellent allegory for the modern corporate age: you don&#x27;t see through her because there&#x27;s nothing else to see.&quot; Her political allegiances are not concrete: In &quot;You Kent Always Say What You Want&quot;, she is shown at the Republican Party headquarters; in &quot;E Pluribus Wiggum&quot;, she is conversely depicted as a Democrat. In &quot;Marge vs. Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens and Gays&quot;, she is seen to lead SSCCATAGAPP&#x27;s anti-youth campaign, declaring, &quot;Children are the future, today belongs to me!&quot;

===Ling Bouvier===

Ling Bouvier (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) is Selma&#x27;s adopted daughter, the adopted niece of Marge and Homer, and the adopted cousin of Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. In Season 16&#x27;s &quot;Goo Goo Gai Pan&quot;, Selma experiences menopause symptoms and becomes concerned that she will never fulfill her dream of being a mother. After an unsuccessful attempt to adopt one of Cletus&#x27;s children (Cletus having given up the baby by mistake. &quot;Seems I misheard my wife. What she said was, she&#x27;s tired of having &quot;rabies&quot;.&quot;), she takes up Lisa&#x27;s proposal to adopt a baby from China. Since China does not allow unmarried people to adopt children, Selma convinces Homer to pretend that he is her husband. Although she succeeds in getting a baby from the adoption agency in Beijing, it is later discovered that her marriage to Homer is fake and Ling gets taken away from her. The Simpsons attempt to kidnap Ling back, but run into a confrontation with the head of the adoption agency, Madame Wu. Selma entreats her to let her keep the baby, to which Madame Wu agrees. Since then, Ling has made several appearances on the show including as Maggie&#x27;s playmate in &quot;Rome-old and Julie-eh&quot;. In Season 24&#x27;s &quot;The Changing of the Guardian&quot;, she has grown to a preschooler and shown as precociously talented, able to play musical instruments and practice painting.

===Lionel Hutz===
===Llewellyn Sinclair===
Llewellyn Sinclair (voiced by Jon Lovitz) is a theater director introduced in &quot;A Streetcar Named Marge&quot; who often works in Springfield, known for his perfectionism and sour temperament. He is most notable for directing the musical theatrical production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; dubbed &quot;Oh, Streetcar!&quot; in which Marge Simpson played the role of Blanche Dubois. He told the actors of this production at the time that he had directed three plays in his lifetime and had three heart attacks, and that he cared so much about his work that he was planning on a fourth.

Years later he directed Krusty the Clown in &quot;The Salesman&#x27;s Bad Day&quot;, a heavily reworked take on &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; since the rights were too much for him to afford. He also directed one of Springfield Elementary&#x27;s second grade plays where he got frustrated at Ralph Wiggum, and attempted to direct a play of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; until his sour attitude turned everybody else on the production against him and Marge took control of the production. His sister runs the Ayn Rand School for Tots.

===Lois Pennycandy===
Lois Pennycandy (voiced by Pamela Hayden) is the executive assistant to Krusty the Clown. She swayed Krusty into visiting Bart after he saved Krusty from jail time, and later reunited him with his estranged father the Rabbi Hyman Krustofski. She was at Krusty&#x27;s side during the auditions in which Robert Terwilliger became Krusty&#x27;s new sidekick, and was at Krusty&#x27;s &quot;funeral&quot; when he was presumed dead after crashing his private plane into a cliff. In a phone conversation, Marge once asked her, &quot;How can [Krusty] hurt someone who loves him so?&quot; While looking at a framed photo of Krusty, Pennycandy replied, &quot;Oh, Mrs. Simpson, I&#x27;ve wasted my womanhood asking that same question.&quot; Her only speaking roles are in &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot; and &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled. Her name alludes to both Miss Moneypenny from the James Bond series and the actress who originated the role, Lois Maxwell. Although rarely featured on the show, she has been a recurring character in the Simpsons comic book series.

===Lou===
Lou (voiced by Hank Azaria from season 1 to 31; Harry Shearer in &quot;Saddlesore Galactica&quot; and &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXVII&quot;; Alex Désert since season 32) is the police sergeant of the Springfield Police Department and by far the most intelligent and competent officer of the Springfield Police. He primarily serves as a foil to Chief Wiggum, and often takes the time to point out his chief&#x27;s mistakes, as well as resent Wiggum, and be aware of his ineptitude. He was also married to a woman named Amy, but later divorced.

Al Jean and Mike Reiss named Lou after Major League Baseball player Lou Whitaker, and Azaria based Lou&#x27;s voice on that of actor Sylvester Stallone. Though he has nearly always been African-American, he was mistakenly animated with yellow in &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot; and his other first-season appearances. Lou permanently became an African-American character in &quot;Bart vs. Thanksgiving&quot;, where he was animated to Eddie&#x27;s voice of Harry Shearer and vice versa.

===Luann Van Houten===
Luann Van Houten (née Mussolini; voiced by Maggie Roswell) is the mother of Bart&#x27;s childhood best friend Milhouse. For the period from 1999 to 2002, during which Roswell left the show, she became a primarily nonspeaking character. Since the season 8 episode, &quot;A Milhouse Divided&quot;, Luann was depicted as a promiscuous single mother, who pushed her love life in the face of her ex-husband, Kirk. She first appeared in &quot;Homer Defined&quot;, as a concerned mother who barred Milhouse from being Bart&#x27;s friend due to Bart being a bad influence. She wears glasses and has blue hair, traits she shares with her husband and son. Her mother is an Italian who abused Milhouse whenever he spoke English. In &quot;Lemon of Troy&quot;, it is revealed that Luann originally came from Springfield&#x27;s bitter rival, Shelbyville, but moved to Springfield early in life, presumably with her father, as her mother remained in Italy. In &quot;A Milhouse Divided&quot;, it is revealed she has a sister (from whom she borrows money, as her husband does not provide for her at all), but whom we never meet. In &quot;Marge Be Not Proud&quot;, Bart turned to Luann for motherly comfort after Marge has become distant with him.

Luann was married to her cousin Kirk for several years, giving birth to a son, Milhouse, yet the marriage was an unhappy one. After an argument over a game of &quot;Pictionary&quot;, she left Kirk after he remarks he cannot draw &quot;dignity&quot;, since he gave it up when he married her. Although Kirk found the new liberty of a single life tough, Luann uses her newfound freedom to live life in the fast lane, advising Marge to forget everything she thought she knew about her, to which Marge replied that she really did not know anything about Luann at all. Luann began dating American Gladiator Pyro shortly after her divorce with Kirk for a few seasons, but was caught cheating on him with his best friend, &quot;Gladiator Gyro&quot;. When Apu Nahasapeemapetilon was a bachelor, Luann was one of his bachelorettes. In &quot;Milhouse of Sand and Fog&quot;, it is revealed that Luann had also gone out with Disco Stu as well and had begun a relationship with Sea Captain.

In &quot;Milhouse of Sand and Fog&quot; the Van Houtens reunited. Since then, they are often seen together (although in the episode &quot;Ice Cream of Margie (with the Light Blue Hair)&quot;, Kirk was seen with Milhouse at a single father&#x27;s outing, indicating the couple had split up, yet again). As of &quot;Little Orphan Millie&quot;, they are remarried. In the 2014 episode &quot;The War of Art&quot;, Kirk and Luann sell a painting to the Simpsons, which later turns out to be a forgery of a valuable piece.

===Lucille Botzkowski===
Lucille Botzkowski (voiced by Penny Marshall) aka &quot;Babysitter Bandit&quot; who is wanted on &quot;America&#x27;s Most Armed and Dangerous&quot; (a parody of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;) is hired by Homer Simpson in &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;. &quot;Ms. Botz&quot; ties up the children and robs the house-only to be captured by the Simpson children. Thanks to Homer&#x27;s stupidity, she escapes. She makes a few cameo appearances such as in &quot;Family Guy&quot;/&quot;Simpsons&quot; crossover &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants&quot;. In one of her last appearances, she is seen in a cell at Springfield&#x27;s Calmwood Hospital in &quot;Stark Raving Dad&quot;.

===Lucius Sweet===
Lucius Sweet (voiced by Paul Winfield) is modeled after Don King. He is the former boxing manager for Moe Szyslak and current boxing manager for Drederick Tatum. He learned Homer&#x27;s talent when Homer started boxing people like Boxcar Bob. He asked Moe for him to fight heavy weight champ Drederick Tatum. They made a deal for Homer to make three rounds against Tatum. When Homer was fighting, he could not even make one round which ticked him off and declared Moe was a loser.

Lucius has a speaking role in &quot;The Trouble with Trillions&quot;.

He later appeared a few more times in the series and &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;. Lucius is on the Springfield Wall of Fame.

===Luigi Risotto===
Luigi Risotto (voiced by Hank Azaria) is the proprietor of Luigi&#x27;s, a Springfield Italian restaurant. He is a parody of the &quot;Italian pasta/pizza chef&quot; stereotype (and in fact is on a bowling team called &quot;The Stereotypes&quot;, along with Cletus Spuckler, Captain Horatio McCallister, and Groundskeeper Willie), but seems to be aware of his status as a stock character. He is polite to his customers and treats them with respect when they order and then loudly insults and belittles them to his cook Salvatore, fully aware that they can hear him from the kitchen. In the episode &quot;The Last of the Red Hat Mamas&quot;, he reveals that he does not speak Italian, only Italian-accented English. It is hinted that Luigi is an illegal immigrant, even though he tried to run for mayor, telling Springfielders, &quot;I make-a you the good government, just how-a you like it!&quot; The animators copied Luigi&#x27;s appearance from a chef that was on the front of a pizza box.

===Lunchlady Dora===

Lunchlady Dora, formerly known as Lunchlady Doris, (voiced by Doris Grau from 1991 to 1997, Tress MacNeille since 2006) is a sardonic cafeteria chef and lunch lady for Springfield Elementary. She can frequently be seen serving deeply unpleasant meals made from horse testicles, grade-F meat (made of circus animals and filler), beef hearts that have been on the cafeteria kitchen floor, shredded newspapers, and ground-up gym mats due to school budget cuts. She made a handful of appearances in her secondary job as a school nurse. In &quot;Whacking Day&quot;, Doris took the job as school nurse to earn two paychecks, but in &#x27;Round Springfield&quot;, she reveals that she was put in the position of school nurse because of school budget cuts (even having Groundskeeper Willie as a French teacher). In &quot;Team Homer&quot;, it is suggested she is the mother of the Squeaky-voiced Teen.

In &quot;The Simpsons Comics&quot;, when asked by Milhouse on the school&#x27;s new chat show, &quot;Moments with Milhouse&quot; (formerly &quot;Moments with Martin&quot;) why the school meals are so bad, Doris admits that a third-grader had once mistakenly eaten her beloved hamster, and she had &quot;sworn culinary revenge ever since&quot;.

After Grau&#x27;s death in 1995, Lunchlady Doris was retired out of respect for over 10 years. Due to the delay between recording some episodes and the time they actually air, Grau&#x27;s voice was included in episodes airing as late as 1997 such as &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Sax&quot;.

Lunchlady Dora is seen as a silent background character until she speaks in the 18th season during &quot;The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer&quot;, where she is voiced by Tress MacNeille, season 19&#x27;s &quot;The Debarted&quot;, where she is again voiced by Tress MacNeille but with a different voice, and season 20&#x27;s &quot;Father Knows Worst&quot;. Lunchlady Dora has been seen dating Hans Moleman.

In &quot;Dark Knight Court&quot;, Groundskeeper Willie refers to her as &quot;Lunchlady Dora&quot;. According to Simpsons writer Michael Price, this name change happened out of respect for Grau&#x27;s death. Al Jean later confirmed on Twitter that Dora was Doris&#x27; sister, meaning the two are separate characters.

===Lurleen Lumpkin===
Lurleen Lumpkin (voiced by Beverly D&#x27;Angelo in &quot;Colonel Homer&quot; and &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Leech&quot;, Doris Grau in &quot;Marge vs. the Monorail&quot;) is an aspiring country singer who is initially managed by Homer in &quot;Colonel Homer&quot;. Homer discovers her in a redneck bar in the middle of nowhere and is amazed by her voice. He decides to help her launch a singing career, much to the chagrin of Marge. Grateful for Homer&#x27;s help, she becomes attracted to him and tries to lure him with an erotic song called &quot;Bunk with Me Tonight&quot;. Homer, who had been ignorant of this, suddenly realizes that managing Lurleen could hurt his marriage, so he quits as her manager. A saddened Lurleen sings a song called &quot;Stand By Your Manager&quot;.

Lurleen next appears briefly in &quot;Marge vs. the Monorail&quot;, sporting torn clothing and an unkempt hairstyle; the episode reveals that she has recently undergone treatment at the Betty Ford Clinic and &quot;spent last night in a ditch&quot;. Her voice matches that of Lunchlady Doris, rather than her soft, Southern voice she had when she was first introduced. In &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;, she is again briefly seen in the center square of &quot;Springfield Squares&quot;.

The nineteenth-season episode &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Leech&quot; follows up on her story with her moving into the Simpsons&#x27; home and taking a waitress job at Moe&#x27;s to pay a $12 million tax bill, having lost most of her earnings over the course of several failed marriages to men who all heavily resembled Homer. In this episode she is again voiced by Beverly D&#x27;Angelo, who also wrote the songs. She has a father named Royce &quot;Boss Hogg&quot; Lumpkin, who was never supportive of her and was missing for years. Marge undertakes efforts to find him and reunite him with Lurleen. As soon as it happens, Lurleen writes a new, upbeat composition called &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Back&quot;, but Royce sells the song, taking the writing credits for himself (but altering some lyrics) to the Dixie Chicks. Lurleen confronts Royce and reveals the truth to the Dixie Chicks, who assault him with their musical instruments and invite Lurleen to join their tour. Lurleen once again ends up engaged to a man who looks very much like Homer and tours as an opening act for the Dixie Chicks.

==M==
===Maggie Simpson===
===Dr. Marvin Monroe===
Dr. Marvin Monroe (voiced by Harry Shearer) is a psychotherapist who first appeared in the first-season episode &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot;. Homer pawns the family television to afford a session with Monroe for him and his dysfunctional family. The failed attempt at therapy culminates with the Simpsons electroshocking each other endlessly, to the point of causing a chaotic brownout. Unable to help the Simpsons, Monroe refunds double what the Simpsons paid, and the Simpsons buy a new TV.

Monroe appears in &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; in which 70% of that episode&#x27;s original animation had to be redone, although the scenes involving Monroe were mostly untouched, said co-director David Silverman. The script of &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; describes Monroe as &quot;a heavy, chain-smoking, compulsive eater.&quot; The original idea behind the character, said Matt Groening, was that he was born Marilyn Monroe and was &quot;very caught up over that&quot;, which is why he became a therapist. Monroe&#x27;s voice is based on psychiatrist David Viscott&#x27;s. Among Monroe&#x27;s works is &quot;Dr. Marvin Monroe&#x27;s Guide to Etiquette&quot;, which Bart receives as a birthday gift in &quot;Radio Bart&quot;.

Since the seventh season, the character Monroe has been retired, as voicing the character strained Shearer&#x27;s throat. The character&#x27;s retirement was marked by the broadcast of a Dr. Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital over Lou&#x27;s walkie-talkie in &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)&quot;. Since then, several references to Monroe being dead have been made: a glimpse of his gravestone in &quot;Alone Again, Natura-Diddily&quot;, a Dr. Marvin Monroe Memorial Gymnasium seen in &quot;Bye Bye Nerdie&quot;, and a trivia interstitial in the &quot;138th Episode Spectacular&quot; regarding which popular characters had recently died. However, Monroe is seen alive in the fifteenth season in &quot;Diatribe of a Mad Housewife&quot; purchasing a copy of Marge&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Harpooned Heart&quot;, stating simply that he had &quot;...been very sick&quot; when asked about his long absence by Marge. He is later seen &quot;stuck in limbo&quot; but seemingly lacking full ghost abilities in &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXV&quot;, and again in &quot;Flanders&#x27; Ladder&quot; as part of a dream Lisa conjures for Bart.

===Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon===
Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon (voiced by Jan Hooks from season 9 to 14, Tress MacNeille from season 7 in the 23rd episode &quot;Much Apu About Nothing&quot;, since season 13) is married to Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and the mother of their octuplets. She first appeared as a little girl in Apu&#x27;s flashback in the seventh season episode &quot;Much Apu About Nothing&quot;, in which Apu tells her that he is sorry that their arranged marriage will not happen, before getting on a plane departing for the U.S. to pursue the American Dream. 

Her first adult appearance is in the ninth season episode &quot;The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons&quot;. She claims &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; is her favorite book, movie, and food. She has excellent culinary skills, demonstrated by her ability to make a wide variety of dishes using only chickpeas, lentils, and sometimes rice. Apu is seen to be very romantically awkward, as well as quite distant from Manjula, and he previously told her that it was customary in America to work long hours, seven days a week, and to never see your wife. In another episode he dons a blonde wig, intending to ditch his family and return to India under the name Steve Barnes.

In &quot;Eight Misbehavin&#x27;&quot;, Manjula gives birth to octuplets after using a fertility drug. In &quot;The Sweetest Apu&quot;, Apu has an affair with the Squishee lady. After Homer discovers this, he and Marge confront Apu, who caves under the guilt and vows to apologize to Manjula, who sets him a number of grueling tasks in penance.

Writer Richard Appel had pitched the idea of Apu marrying years before he wrote &quot;The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons&quot; for season nine. For that episode, it took several attempts by the character designers to model Manjula because making women look appealing in Matt Groening&#x27;s drawing style is hard for the animators to do. Writer David Cohen named Manjula after a friend of much of the staff.

Manjula appeared in the season 26 episode &quot;Covercraft&quot; but did not speak.

===Marge Simpson===
===Martha Prince===
Martha &quot;Gloria&quot; Prince (voiced by Russi Taylor in &quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot;, Tress MacNeille in &quot;Orange Is the New Yellow&quot; and Pamela Hayden since season 33) is married to Martin Prince Sr. and mother of Martin Prince. Martha attempted to sell Martin&#x27;s valuable &quot;Star Wars&quot; merchandise to Comic Book Guy for almost nothing, despite a warning not to do so by Bart and Milhouse. According to Martin she shoplifts &quot;stuff she doesn&#x27;t even need&quot;. She was responsible for all of the guests, even her own son getting sick at his birthday party, by serving diseased oysters instead of cake, with the exception of Bart (who fed his oysters to Martin&#x27;s pet cat), Lisa (who feigned sick to get out of the boring party) and Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel (who were having a romantic encounter in Martin&#x27;s kid-sized pink playhouse).

===Martha Quimby===
Martha Quimby (voiced by Maggie Roswell in later appearances, Tress MacNeille in &quot;The Last of the Red Hat Mamas&quot;, &quot;Homerazzi&quot; and &quot;E Pluribus Wiggum&quot;) is married to the Mayor of Springfield: Joseph Quimby. She wears a pink outfit and a pillbox hat similar to the outfit worn by Jackie Kennedy on the day of the Kennedy assassination. According to Mayor Quimby, the couple met while Martha was working at the &quot;Maison Derrière&quot;, a local burlesque house. She first appeared in &quot;Bart Gets Famous&quot;, when she walks in on Mayor Quimby in bed with another woman, an event she laughs off when he defends himself with &quot;I didn&#x27;t do it.&quot; She is humiliated when Marge accidentally uncovers her husband&#x27;s lothario ways in &quot;The Last of the Red Hat Mamas&quot; and kicks Marge and her friends out before they can have tea.

===Martin Prince===
Martin Prince Jr. (voiced by Russi Taylor from season 1 to 30, Grey DeLisle since season 31, Jo Ann Harris in &quot;Homer’s Night Out&quot;, Michael Jackson in &quot;Do the Bartman&quot;, Nancy Cartwright in &quot;Principal Charming&quot;, &quot;Bart’s Dog Gets an F&quot; and &quot;Lisa the Beauty Queen&quot;, Pamela Hayden in &quot;Cape Feare&quot; and &quot;Rosebud&quot;, Dan Castellaneta in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot;) is a fourth grade student at Springfield Elementary School, is Bart Simpson&#x27;s classmate (and a temporary tutor on &quot;Bart Gets an &#x27;F&#x27;), Lisa Simpson&#x27;s intellectual rival, and Nelson Muntz&#x27;s favorite target for bullying. He is academically brilliant, a teacher&#x27;s pet, and is portrayed as a stereotypical nerd, enthusiastic about topics like science fiction and role-playing games. In line with the stereotype, he also has poor fashion sense and once dressed up as Calliope for Halloween. It is sometimes implied that Martin is gay but closeted.

He is the son of Martin Sr. and Martha. He has an IQ of 216 (which was thought to be Bart&#x27;s IQ). As the class nerd, he becomes the perfect target for ruthless bullying at Springfield Elementary School. He is a member of the Springfield band, and is often seen with a French horn. Martin&#x27;s most famous catchphrases are &quot;Behold!&quot; and &quot;Excelsior!&quot; In &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, Martin gets revenge for all the years of bullying by hitting Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney with a plank of wood. In &quot;Dial &#x27;N&#x27; for Nerder&quot;, Bart&#x27;s prank causes Martin to fall off a cliff, which he survives (although Bart and Lisa think he is dead and try a cover-up). In &quot;Girls Just Shauna Have Fun&quot;, it is revealed that he has an older brother in high school.

===Martin Prince Sr.===
Martin &quot;Gareth&quot; Prince Sr. (voiced by Harry Shearer in &quot;Bart the Genius&quot; and &quot;Bart on the Road&quot;, Dan Castellaneta from season 2 to 32, Hank Azaria since season 33) is the father of Martin Prince, and husband of Martha Prince. He is a stockbroker in Springfield and was shown bringing his son to work on &quot;Go To Work With Your Parents Day&quot;, where Martin made over $1 million trading soy futures (and subsequently lost all but $600). He appears to be a nerd much like his son, and has a slight lisp. Martin Sr. was also one of the fathers who traveled in Ned Flanders&#x27;s RV to locate their sons in Shelbyville.

===Mary Bailey===
Mary Bailey (voiced by Maggie Roswell in later appearances, Tress MacNeille in &quot;The Seven-Beer Snitch&quot;) is the Democratic governor of Springfield&#x27;s state. She ran against Mr. Burns in &quot;Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish&quot;, winning in a landslide after Mr. Burns spit out a piece of baked Three eyed Fish during a photo-op at the Simpsons&#x27; home. Mary Bailey would later appear briefly in the episode &quot;Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade&quot; when Bart and Lisa&#x27;s class visit Capital City. They show Bailey their class projects (designing a new state flag). Mary Bailey wails in disgust after unfurling Lisa&#x27;s flag: Bart had redesigned it to look like a butt, with &quot;Learn to Fart&quot; underneath. She appears in &quot;The Seven-Beer Snitch&quot; where a prison is built out of a defunct concert hall. She decides to release all the abused prisoners to a garbage barge where they would &quot;bare-knuckle box until one of you emerges as king of your floating hell&quot;.

===Mary Spuckler===
Mary Wrestlemania Spuckler (voiced by Zooey Deschanel) is one of Cletus and Brandine&#x27;s many children. She first appeared in &quot;Apocalypse Cow&quot;, in which she befriends Bart when he joins the 4-H club. Later in the episode, after Bart frees his cow, Lou, from the slaughterhouse, he brings him to Mary&#x27;s home, where he discovers that she is Cletus&#x27; daughter. However, after Mary agrees to take Lou, much to her and Bart&#x27;s dismay, Cletus informs Bart that to them, a cow is a token of marriage. After some convincing from Lisa, Bart agrees to go along with the wedding to prevent Lou from being sent back to the slaughterhouse. However, before Bart and Mary can be wed, Marge crashes the wedding, and on her influence, Bart calls it off.

Mary later reappeared in the twenty fourth season episode, &quot;Moonshine River&quot;. In it, she is deemed as Bart&#x27;s last hope in his quest to find true love (in the form of one of his many former dates). When Bart arrives at the Spuckler house, Cletus informs him that she ran away after he scheduled her for marriage again. Her brother, Dubya, tells Bart that Mary ran away to New York City and gives him her address. After Bart and the rest of his family travel to The Big Apple, he eventually finds her at her address, and discovers that she has matured, becoming slightly taller and slimmer, and also learns that she now works as a writer and has a performance option on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Mary and several citizens of New York sing a song for Bart, and the two realize that they truly love one another.

Before they can kiss, Cletus arrives, having somehow found out where Mary is, and asks her to return home. Mary accepts, but while at the train station, she and Bart take advantage of Cletus&#x27;s distraction to flee to another departing train. Mary tells Bart that there will be more Mary Spucklers out there, and gives him their first kiss before she leaves. The family and Cletus arrive, with Cletus demanding where Mary is heading for, but Bart, not wanting to ruin his last chance at true love, refuses, and Cletus then accepts the fact that he must let his daughter go. Mary reappeared again in the season, in the episode &quot;Love is a Many-Splintered Thing&quot;.

===Maude Flanders===
Maude Flanders, (voiced by Maggie Roswell, Pamela Hayden in &quot;A Star Is Burns&quot;, understudied by Marcia Mitzman Gaven between 1999 and 2000) is the first wife of Ned Flanders, and the mother of Rod and Todd. While she was not employed outside the home, Maude was a busy homemaker and advocate for children, whose innocence was often sullied by cartoon violence, liberal education, and the insidious influences of popular culture. Although she spent much of her free time in prayer, reading the Bible, and helping out her husband at the Leftorium, she let her hair down for the occasional dinner parties at the home of her neighbors, the Simpsons. Homer often made statements insinuating his attraction to Maude. In the season 2 episode &quot;The War of the Simpsons&quot;, Homer ogled Maude&#x27;s cleavage at a dinner party, which resulted in him and Marge going to marriage camp.

In the season 11 episode &quot;Alone Again, Natura-Diddily&quot;, Maude was killed by a T-shirt cannon at the Springfield Speedway when Homer ducked at the last second to pick up a bobby pin on the ground. She was knocked off the grandstand and her timely rescue was delayed because Homer had parked in the ambulance zone. Ned was devastated by her death. One of the most controversial moments in the show among fans, this kill-off was met with strong criticism but was decided by the show&#x27;s producers to open new story lines for the series. The character was voiced by Marcia Mitzman Gaven at that time.

Roswell returned to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in 2002 after reaching a deal with producers to allow her to record her lines from her home in Denver. Since returning, she has voiced Maude in flashbacks and as a ghost.

Maude&#x27;s ghost appears in the opening sequence for &quot;Treehouse of Horror XIII&quot;, and during the credits of &quot;Bart Has Two Mommies&quot; she is seen in heaven with Bob Hope and God. She appears through flashbacks in &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot;, &quot;Take My Life, Please&quot;, &quot;Postcards from the Wedge&quot; and &quot;Fland Canyon&quot;. She had a small role in &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXII&quot;, and she appeared as a ghost in the couch gag for season 23 episode &quot;Them, Robot&quot;. Maude once again appears in Bart&#x27;s dream-state in &quot;Flanders&#x27; Ladder&quot; where she plays a more pivotal role, and is almost successful in her desire for revenge against Homer. She also appears in season 31 episode 9 &quot;Todd, Todd, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?&quot;, as well as in season 32 episode 16 &quot;Manger Things&quot;.

===Mayor Quimby===
===Mayor Quimby&#x27;s bodyguards===
Mayor Quimby&#x27;s Bodyguards (both voiced by Dan Castellaneta) are two unnamed large and expressionless men in dark suits and sunglasses. They are usually seen flanking the mayor at town meetings, but sometimes they appear as members of a crowd. On one occasion they neglected their duties while admiring passing clouds, oblivious to Quimby being in danger. This resulted in their being temporarily replaced by Homer. When Cookie Kwan presented a baby that she claimed was Quimby&#x27;s, the mayor passed it off to one of the bodyguards and told him to raise the child as his own. The bodyguard put sunglasses on the baby.

===Milhouse Van Houten===
===Ms. Albright===
Ms. Teresa Albright (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is the First Church of Springfield Sunday school teacher, who is constantly forced to deal with the children&#x27;s questions about the more difficult to explain aspects of religion, leading her to yell &quot;Is a little blind faith too little to ask?&quot;. She first appeared in &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;. She speaks with a harsh Southern accent. She appears to be good friends with Helen Lovejoy and is occasionally seen in the background of various episodes as well as in church scenes (such as in the episode titled &quot;The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star&quot;).

===Miss Springfield===
Miss Springfield (voiced by Nancy Cartwright in &quot;Whacking Day&quot; and &quot;You Kent Always Say What You Want&quot;, Tress MacNeille in later appearances) is a beauty pageant winner, who first appears in &quot;Whacking Day&quot;. She is the lover of Mayor Quimby, and is seen several times in bed with him. She only appears with the sash and the crown of Miss Springfield. She has a distinctive, high-pitched voice, which Quimby had originally not heard due to nearby air traffic drowning her out during their romantic encounters, and regrets naming an opera house after her once he hears it.

In &quot;Mayored to the Mob&quot;, she is one of two women escorting Mayor Quimby to a convention. Since then, she is often seen escorting him to Springfield events such as conventions, recitals, and plays. In one episode, it is revealed she is illiterate. Quimby scolds her for lying about her graduating from &quot;typing school&quot;. She then admits she has trouble with the space bar. In &quot;Smoke on the Daughter&quot;, she appears (and claims to be) pregnant, and Quimby believes he may be the father.

===Moe Szyslak===
===Mona Simpson===
Mona Simpson (voiced by most prominently by Glenn Close, but also Maggie Roswell, Tress MacNeille, and Pamela Hayden) was the estranged wife of Abe Simpson, the mother of Homer Simpson, and the mother-in-law of Marge Simpson. 

The character appeared briefly in flashbacks in the early seasons of the show and was absent from Homer&#x27;s life but no reason was given. The season seven episode &quot;Mother Simpson&quot; was the first to focus on the character. It was established that Homer believed that his mother was dead, a lie his father, Abe, told him when in reality she was on the run from the law after she sabotaged Mr. Burns&#x27;s biological warfare laboratory, living under the name &quot;Anita Bonghit&quot;. She also had a large role in &quot;My Mother the Carjacker&quot;. The character appeared again in season 19&#x27;s &quot;Mona Leaves-a&quot;, and dies during the episode. An &quot;Inception&quot;-inspired dream version of her appears in season 23&#x27;s &quot;How I Wet Your Mother&quot;. In the episode &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Fly a Coot&quot;, a flashback reveals she met Abe when she was a waitress in a cantina and he broke the sound barrier to impress her. 

In an alternative retconned story introduced in &quot;Mothers and Other Strangers&quot;, Homer discovered Mona&#x27;s whereabouts in Utah when he was a teenager and went with Grampa to track her down, while unknowingly being tailed by FBI agents. The agents pursued Homer, Grampa and Mona to a canyon where Grampa got stuck in a small gap. Forced to choose between both his parents, Homer went back to save Grampa, while Mona managed to flee on a bus to San Francisco. In the present, Grampa and Homer lament to a therapist how they were never able to find Mona again, but Homer does reveal to his family that Mona secretly visited him in the hospital when Bart was born, disguising herself as a doctor.

Glenn Close has been well received as the voice of Mona. IGN ranked Close as the 25th-best guest star in the show&#x27;s history for her first two performances as Mona. In 2007, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called Close one of &quot;fourteen guest stars whose standout performances on TV make us wish they&#x27;d turn up in a &quot;Simpsons Movie 2&quot;&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also named Close one of the 16 best &quot;Simpsons&quot; guest stars. The Phoenix.com placed Close in the second position on their list of the best 20 &quot;Simpsons&quot; guest stars. Star News Online listed Close as one of the four hundred reasons why they love &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Close appeared on AOL&#x27;s list of their favorite 25 &quot;Simpsons&quot; guest stars. Robert Canning of IGN wrote that Close &quot;gave us the sweet voice of Mona Simpson. She&#x27;s a perfect fit, able to convey a loving, motherly tone, while still convincing the audience she&#x27;s a headstrong hippie activist.&quot;

===Mr. Burns===
===Mr. Costington===
Mr. Bruce Costington (voiced by Hank Azaria) is the president of Costington&#x27;s Department Store. He first appeared as &quot;Chairman&quot; in the season nine episode &quot;Trash of the Titans&quot;, in which he invented &quot;Love Day&quot;, and later in &quot;Homer vs. Dignity&quot;. He is one of very few characters on the show who has eyebrows. Costington&#x27;s catchphrase is &quot;You&#x27;re fiiired!&quot;, delivered while shaking his jowls. In &quot;The Boys of Bummer&quot;, he hires Homer with a jowl-shaking &quot;You&#x27;re hiiired!&quot; Homer has worked for him on three occasions: as a Thanksgiving Day Parade Santa Claus, mattress salesman, and model for top-brand jeans. He also employs the Yes Guy, who is seen working at the store in most of his appearances. Although he is usually generous, he can sometimes be insensitive. He has admitted to having a shoe-sniffing problem, and is still banned from the shoe department in his own store.

===Mr. Teeny===
Louis &quot;Mr. Teeny&quot; Toot, also known as Joseph Teeny (vocal effects provided by Dan Castellaneta), is Krusty&#x27;s trained chimpanzee who frequently appears on the show. He first appeared in &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge&quot;. Like Krusty, he is a heavy smoker, and often seems depressed off-stage. He is sometimes seen as Krusty&#x27;s driver and butler. Teeny&#x27;s uncle was former head monkey at the ministry of tourism in Brazil. Three other monkeys have died while working for Krusty known by the same name. Krusty once said he missed the third Mr. Teeny and the current one could not hold a candle to him. In the episode &quot;Day of the Jackanapes&quot;, Teeny saves Krusty from a bomb that Sideshow Bob has attached to Bart. His mother&#x27;s name is Toot-Toot, and she refers to him as Louis when they are reunited in &quot;Bart Has Two Mommies&quot;. Teeny also was a writer for the &quot;Good Guy Awards&quot; and quit after being insulted on-stage by Krusty. He is an immigrant from Brazil and has been deported but was returned. He wears a pink hat and bow tie but has also been seen in a tuxedo and golden encrusted thong. Krusty has implied that if he can not find a human willing to donate a lung when he gets cancer, he is planning on harvesting one from Mr. Teeny. As of &quot;Wedding For Disaster&quot;, there have been seven Mr. Teenys.

===Mrs. Glick===
Alice Glick (voiced by Cloris Leachman in &quot;Three Men and a Comic Book&quot;, Nancy Cartwright in &quot;Whacking Day&quot;, Tress MacNeille in later appearances) is an elderly recluse for whom Bart did chores in &quot;Three Men and a Comic Book&quot;; he did not get paid very well, so he started to hate her. She had a brother named Asa, mentioned in the same episode, who died during World War I; he was killed by his own grenade, which he held for too long while naming off the men in his company (His last words were, &quot;This one&#x27;s for you, Kaiser Bill. Special delivery from Uncle Sam and all the boys in &#x27;D&#x27; Company: Johnny, Harrison, Brooklyn Bob, and Reggie. Yeah, even Reggie! He ain&#x27;t so stuck up once you get to kno--&quot;). Doctor Hibbert once confessed to leaving his car keys inside her. She is occasionally seen in the background of various episodes, often with a toothless laugh. She is a stereotypical lonely old woman, who spends her days &quot;watching her stories&quot;.

She later dies from a heart attack caused by Bart and Martin&#x27;s robotic seal on the episode &quot;Replaceable You&quot;. Her final scene is dancing with Jesus in Heaven.

===Mrs. Muntz===
Mrs. Marilyn Muntz (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is Nelson&#x27;s mother. Nelson receives his trademark laugh from her. Early on in the series, Nelson would mention his parents and it became apparent that Mrs. Muntz does not care much about her son. In &quot;A Milhouse Divided&quot;, Nelson tells Milhouse that his mom is addicted to cough drops, which is why his father left the family. Mrs. Muntz works at Hooters in &quot;Bart Star&quot;, but was fired in a later episode for gaining weight. She owns a dilapidated house and is depicted as a jailbird, a prostitute, a stripper, et al.

In &#x27;Tis the Fifteenth Season&quot;, she appears, telling Nelson that his father simply did not like him, and he left with her golden tooth. Nelson&#x27;s mother was fully introduced in &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot;, after years of being mentioned. A loud, high-pitched contemptuous woman, she neglects her son. She implies she misses Nelson&#x27;s father (who, depending on episode, is either divorced from Nelson&#x27;s mom, went insane and never came home, or was forced to work as a sideshow freak after suffering a peanut allergy). At the end of the episode, Nelson and his parents reunite, and she gets a job as Lady Macbeth with &quot;the third director she slept with&quot;. Since then, she is often seen around in Springfield. Curiously, in Season 18&#x27;s &quot;The Haw-Hawed Couple&quot;, she appears with brown hair. As revealed in &quot;Dial &#x27;N&#x27; for Nerder&quot;, Nelson refers to her as Mrs. Muntz. She has a brief appearance in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, at the end of the sequence where Bart skateboards to the Krustyburger in the nude, laughing along with Nelson at Bart who is tied to a post.

===Mrs. Risotto===
Mrs. &quot;Mama&quot; Risotto (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is the mother of Luigi Risotto who is also an expert chef.

==N==
===Dr. Nick===

Nicholas Riviera, M.D. (voiced by Hank Azaria), usually referred to as Dr. Nick, is an inept physician. Upon entering a scene, Dr. Nick&#x27;s catchphrase is &quot;Hi, everybody!&quot;, with the characters present responding &quot;Hi, Dr. Nick!&quot;. He frequently appears on infomercials, pitching all sorts of bizarre medical offers or endorsing dubious devices and products such as &quot;Sun and Run&quot; (laxative sunscreen), and often turns his operations into TV spectacles. He is also shown as an inventor/huckster on the television show &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe They Invented It!&quot; The design of Dr. Nick is modeled physically on Gábor Csupó, the co-founder of Klasky Csupo animation studios (which animated the series for its first three seasons and &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; shorts). The animators mistakenly believed that Hank Azaria was impersonating Csupó, when in fact he was doing an impression of Ricky Ricardo from the TV series &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. He is named after George C. Nichopoulos, a former physician best known for overprescribing prescription drugs to Elvis Presley and contributing to his death from cardiac arrest in 1977. &quot;IGN&quot; placed Dr. Nick 23rd on their list of the &quot;Top 25 &quot;Simpsons&quot; Peripheral Characters&quot;. The character was listed in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;30 Great TV Doctors and Nurses&quot; and in &quot;Philadelphia Magazine&quot; &quot;10 Best Doctors on Television&quot;. In a tongue-in-cheek analysis, the &quot;Canadian Medical Association Journal&quot; (&quot;CMAJ&quot;) compared the services of Riviera and Dr. Hibbert. It concluded that Riviera was a better role model for physicians.

===Nahasapeemapetilon octuplets===
The Nahasapeemapetilon octuplets are the children of Apu and Manjula, four boys and four girls, called: Anoop, Nabendu, Sandeep, Gheet, Uma, Poonam, Pria and Sashi. Introduced in the episode &quot;Eight Misbehavin&#x27;, they are the result of Manjula being slipped fertility drugs not only by her husband, but by most of the Simpson family as well as part of trying to help Apu and Manjula conceive after weeks of failure.

===Ned Flanders===
===Nelson Muntz===
;

==O==
===Old Barber===
Jake the Barber (voiced by Dan Castellaneta in most episodes, Harry Shearer in &quot;Lisa the Tree Hugger&quot;) is a barber who originated in one of the Tracey Ullman shorts, &quot;Bart&#x27;s Haircut&quot;. In the short, he cuts Bart&#x27;s hair not to his liking and Bart tries several ways to hide it. Dan Castellaneta based the voice on comedian Bob Elliott.

The Old Barber made his last appearance in the twelfth season episode &quot;Lisa the Tree Hugger&quot;. David Silverman had to create a model sheet of the Old Barber for Jim Reardon, who directed &quot;22 Short Films about Springfield&quot;. Before then, there was no model sheet for the character.

===Old Jewish Man===
Asa Hassan, a.k.a. Old Jewish Man, or Crazy Old Man (according to &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;; voiced by Hank Azaria) is Abraham Simpson and Jasper Beardly&#x27;s friend. Mayor Quimby once referred to him as &quot;Old Jewish Man&quot;; also, a list of heart recipients in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Paternity Coot&quot; listed him as &quot;Old Jewish Man&quot;. He speaks with a stereotypical Yiddish accent and curses in Yiddish in one episode. He is apparently friendly with Krusty the Clown and Krusty&#x27;s father, according to &quot;Simpsons Christmas Stories&quot;. He is often seen yelling at people, and as seen in &quot;Attack of the 50-Foot Eyesores&quot;, owns a store called Zip Boys, a parody of Pep Boys. He once had a brief period of stardom after his act of dancing on a street corner singing &quot;The Old Gray Mare&quot; with his pants down became a hit on television. In &quot;Natural Born Kissers&quot;, it was revealed that he worked as a studio executive during the making of &quot;Casablanca&quot; and suppressed an alternate ending to the film (and also suppressed an alternate ending to &quot;It&#x27;s A Wonderful Life&quot; that would have included a killing spree). He observes that the quality of studio management has changed over the years. In &quot;Love Is a Many Strangled Thing&quot; he dies from overexerting himself while dancing (though this does not stop his ghost from dancing), but in &quot;Replaceable You&quot;, he is alive.

===Opal===
Opal (voiced by Tress MacNeille from 2006 to 2007, Dawnn Lewis since 2023) is a talk show host. This celebrity is based on Oprah Winfrey and her eponymous television show. She first appears in &quot;Ice Cream of Margie (with the Light Blue Hair)&quot; where her segment on successful women depresses Marge, who feels her life of chores and child-raising has left her without any purpose. She later appeared in the back-to-back nineteenth season episodes &quot;Husbands and Knives&quot; and &quot;Funeral for a Fiend&quot;. Marge is a fan and was interviewed by Opal after achieving success through her chain of &quot;Shapes&quot; gyms for women. She also appeared in the episode &quot;Fan-ily Feud&quot;, in which she uses Homer Simpson against her rival, Ashlee Starling. She was voiced by Jade Novah, who also did Starling&#x27;s voice.

===Otto Mann===
Otto Mann (voiced by Harry Shearer) is the school bus driver for Springfield Elementary School. He is notable for his bad driving (which got him temporarily fired on the season three episode &quot;The Otto Show&quot;), his drug use (mostly marijuana and hallucinogenics, as mentioned on season seven&#x27;s &quot;Homerpalooza&quot;), and his love of heavy metal music. Despite his irresponsible and illicit behavior, he is generally well-intentioned and has a positive relationship with the children at Springfield Elementary. His father is an admiral with the US Navy who does not like that his son wasted his youth and never amounted to anything. He was modelled upon early &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer Wallace Wolodarsky, who at the time wore long black hair, shorts and a baseball cap.

==P==
===The Parson===
The Parson (voiced by Hank Azaria) is a charismatic major leader of the Presbylutheran faith practiced in Springfield. He is a former college roommate and close friend to Reverend Lovejoy. His world spiritual headquarters is in Michigan City, Indiana. His appearance and mannerisms are similar to those of Bing Crosby.

===Patches and Poor Violet===
Patches and Poor Violet (voiced by Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille) are two of Springfield&#x27;s orphans. Introduced in &quot;Miracle on Evergreen Terrace&quot;, Patches gives the dollar they were saving to Bart, which was their vitamin money. They have since had appearances in &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; to Praiseland&quot; and &quot;Simple Simpson&quot;, but are seen in many other episodes. Poor Violet often has a cough, while Patches seems to vaguely resemble Tiny Tim from Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. Their skin color is not the &quot;healthy&quot; yellow of the Simpson family, but rather a more sallow, sickly tone.

===Patty and Selma===
===Plopper===

Plopper, also known as Spider-Pig (a play on the popular fictional character Spider-Man) and Harry Plopper (a play on the popular fictional character Harry Potter), is a domestic pig who first appears in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;. Plopper has since become memetic, gaining popularity in the real world and on the internet, with his theme song &quot;Spider-Pig&quot; peaking at number 23 in the UK Singles Chart. The pig is voiced by Tress MacNeille. Plopper has since made appearances in the episodes and comics, and also appears in the reanimated opening sequence, featuring in the pan across Springfield.

Plopper&#x27;s first appearance is in the movie, where he stars in a TV ad to promote Krusty&#x27;s new burger, The Clogger. After the filming is completed, Krusty orders the pig to be killed. Homer becomes upset about this, and immediately adopts him. Homer then spends a lot of time with Plopper and neglects Bart. Later in the movie, Homer is seen making the pig walk on the ceiling while singing &quot;Spider Pig&quot;, a parody of the Spider-Man theme song. Homer later calls him Harry Plopper, and the pig is seen with glasses and a lightning bolt-shaped scar, based on the character Harry Potter. Homer then creates a large container in which to put Plopper&#x27;s &quot;leavings&quot;, which he dumps in a lake and pollutes the whole area, leading to the shutdown and near-destruction of Springfield (to which Homer does not want to return).

At one point in the movie, the Simpsons&#x27; house is completely destroyed after being sucked into a sinkhole in their backyard. This led to several people assuming that Plopper was killed. However, during the 2007 San Diego Comic Convention, an official Simpsons Panel revealed that there was a scene at the end of the movie involving the pig that was cut which later appeared on the DVD. This removed sequence is a slightly alternate ending of the movie when the townspeople are rebuilding the Simpsons&#x27; house and involves Plopper, a squirrel mutated by the lake&#x27;s pollution and Santa&#x27;s Little Helper painting a doghouse. During the following seasons, Plopper makes a few more appearances, including a main role in the 2017 episode &quot;Pork and Burns&quot;.

===Poochie===

Poochie (voiced by Dan Castellaneta when voiced by Homer Simpson, Alex Rocco when voiced by Roger Meyers Jr. in &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show”) is an anthropomorphic dog that appeared in &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot;. When network executives decided that &quot;The Itchy and Scratchy Show&quot; needed an update to keep the &quot;interest&quot; of its audience, they devised Poochie, a cartoon dog &quot;with an attitude&quot;. After widespread auditions, Homer was chosen to provide Poochie&#x27;s voice. The character debuted to an unimpressed audience, following a massive publicity campaign; he only served to interfere with the well-oiled machine of hyperviolent slapstick that Itchy and Scratchy had perfected over the years. When dissatisfied viewers flooded the network with letters crying for Poochie&#x27;s immediate removal, if not death, the executives decided to get rid of the character. Homer begged for another chance, insisting that Poochie would grow on the audience; this argument held little weight until the actress who performed voices for both Itchy and Scratchy declared her support for Poochie as well. However, Homer was shocked when the next cartoon aired: it contained a hastily animated, retroscripted segment stating that Poochie had decided to return to his &quot;home planet&quot;, and that he died on the way there.

Poochie has since been seen once at a funeral in an &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; cartoon featured in &quot;Little Big Mom&quot;.

In &quot;Treehouse of Horror IX&quot;, he skateboards in the road and gets run over by Scratchy driving a car when he and Itchy are chasing after Bart and Lisa at the time when they were transported into their cartoon. However, he survives, only to have his skateboard fall from the sky and hit him in the head. He continues to be released in Itchy &amp; Scratchy-related merchandise such as T-shirts in &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot;.

A matrix Poochie appears in &quot;Kill Gil Vols. 1 &amp; 2&quot; during the Krusty on Ice show, and a Poochie balloon appears in the cartoon in &quot;Funeral for a Fiend&quot;.

Poochie reappeared in &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot; as a boss on the &quot;Grand Theft Scratchy&quot; level.

===Professor Frink===
===Princess Kashmir===
Princess Kashmir (voiced by Maggie Roswell) is the belly dancer who first appears in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Night Out&quot; (and was the first woman who almost ruined Homer&#x27;s marriage to Marge as Marge saw Homer dancing with her as a bad example for Bart in how to treat women). She dated Apu in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Pony&quot;, dated Apu&#x27;s brother Sanjay on a few occasions, is seen dancing with Otto in the episode &quot;Flaming Moe&#x27;s&quot;, and with Chief Wiggum in the episode &quot;Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment&quot; (which also shocked and offended the women in town, much like what happened with Homer).

She has appeared in two couch gags (the one on &quot;Marge vs. The Monorail, in which the Simpsons sit on the couch, followed by three rows of recurring extras and secondary characters, and the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; album parody on &quot;Bart After Dark&quot; and the original airing of &quot;The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochy Show&quot;), and is seen dancing on the stage in the Maison Derrière in the episode &quot;Bart After Dark&quot;. Her nickname is &#x27;Queen of the Mysterious East&#x27;. Her real name is Shauna Tifton, and also goes by April Flowers when performing in strip clubs. According to the DVD commentary for the season eight episode &quot;Bart After Dark&quot;, Princess Kashmir was originally going to be an actual bachelor party stripper on her premiere episode, but the FOX censors at the time objected (though they had no problem letting Princess Kashmir tell Bart that she works under the name &quot;April Flowers&quot; when she performs at strip clubs). She was also seen in The Simpsons Movie during a crowd scene.

===Principal Dondelinger===
Harlan Dondelinger (voiced by Harry Shearer) was Springfield High School&#x27;s principal, first seen in the episode &quot;The Way We Was&quot;, a flashback to Homer and Marge&#x27;s senior year in high school. He later appeared in the episode &quot;The Front&quot; at Homer and Marge&#x27;s high school reunion and teaches night classes to ease the pain of his wife&#x27;s recent death. He appeared in &quot;Half-Decent Proposal&quot; when Artie Ziff, Marge&#x27;s high school prom date, recreated their prom. Dondelinger made his most recent appearance in the twentieth season episode &quot;Take My Life, Please&quot;, in which it is revealed that he rigged the high-school senior class presidential election against Homer, after hearing that the students were going to vote for Homer as a joke. Upon finding out, Homer was angry with Dondelinger, who claimed that he had only done it to spare Homer&#x27;s feelings. Homer&#x27;s anger escalated when a mystic saucier at Luigi&#x27;s restaurant shows him that Homer would have had a more successful life had he become Class President.

===Principal Skinner===

==R==
===Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky===
Hyman Krustofsky (voiced by Jackie Mason, understudied by Dan Castellaneta) was a rabbi and the father of Krusty the Clown. Rabbi Krustofsky first appeared in the third season episode &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot;.

In &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot;, Rabbi Krustofsky had been estranged from his son for 25 years, having kicked Krusty out when the young man chose to become a clown rather than follow the family tradition of becoming a rabbi. Years later, after much exchanging of Talmud passages with Bart, a quote Bart provides from Sammy Davis Jr. admiring the Jews finally convinced Rabbi Krustofsky to accept his son for his career in entertainment. He and Krusty reunited on air during Krusty&#x27;s show. The episode &quot;Like Father Like Clown&quot; is a parody of the film &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;. The parody was writer Jay Kogen&#x27;s idea. He thought it would be a funny parallel—and a chance to do a lot of easy jokes—if it were a clown instead of a singer who gets rejected by his father. The character&#x27;s casting was fitting in that the real-life Mason, like Krusty, also came from a family of rabbis but instead became a comedian.

Rabbi Krustofsky later conducted Krusty&#x27;s Bar Mitzvah in &quot;Today I Am a Clown&quot;, admitting that he had not previously, out of fear that the young Krusty would just make fun of the whole thing. In &quot;Clown in the Dumps&quot;, Krusty comes to him for advice, and he dies when telling Krusty that his jokes were &quot;Eh&quot;.

Jackie Mason won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his performance as Krustofsky in &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot; in 1992. &quot;The Phoenix&quot; named Mason one of the show&#x27;s 20 best guest stars.

===Rachel Jordan===
Rachel Jordan (voiced by Shawn Colvin) is the lead singer of Kovenant, a fictional Christian rock band. She is first seen in &quot;Alone Again, Natura-Diddily&quot;, when she befriends the widower Ned Flanders. She appears towards the end of the episode singing the song &quot;He&#x27;s the Man&quot; while the organist at the church was on a much needed vacation. The song was featured on &quot;The Simpsons: Testify&quot;. She returns in &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; to Praiseland&quot;. She stays at the Flanders&#x27; house with Ned, and leaves horrified after Ned attempted to mold her in the image of his deceased wife Maude. At the end of the episode, she returns and has a date with Ned, wearing a wig to cover up the Maude haircut and helping him move on from Maude&#x27;s death. She has not made an appearance since.

===Radioactive Man===
Radioactive Man (voiced by Harry Shearer) is a fictional comic book superhero. The character was heavily featured in the episodes &quot;Three Men and a Comic Book&quot; and &quot;Radioactive Man&quot;. Within the &quot;Simpsons&quot; universe, he was created by Morty Mann. He has been portrayed in many media since his debut in &quot;Interesting Stories&quot; No. 27. The first issue of &quot;Radioactive Man&quot; appeared in 1952. He was featured in at least one 1950s era black-and-white serial, sponsored by Laramie Cigarettes. There was also a campy early 1970s television series resembling &quot;Batman&quot;. This version was played by an actor named Dirk Richter, who was allegedly murdered in a brothel some time after the show ended, a parody of George Reeves and the controversy surrounding his death. In the episode &quot;Radioactive Man&quot;, a Hollywood studio attempted to film a Radioactive Man movie in Springfield. The movie starred Rainier Wolfcastle as Radioactive Man. The role of Fallout Boy, Radioactive Man&#x27;s sidekick, was cast from local children and went to Milhouse Van Houten. The movie was never completed due to budget overruns caused by constant price-gouging by Springfield vendors, and Milhouse snapping from the pressure of the role, and refusing to continue to portray Fallout Boy. A last-ditch attempt at replacing Milhouse with Mickey Rooney fails, and the movie is cancelled.

Outside &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the Radioactive Man character also appeared in a real comic book series based on him that was first published by Bongo Comics in 1993. The Bongo comics expanded more on the character, including his powers, giving him several which parodied those of Superman including super speed, flight, and the power to fire beams of &quot;clean, nuclear heat&quot; from his eyes. In the comics, his regular personality, Claude Kane III, is seen as a useless layabout. Claude&#x27;s main love interest, journalist Gloria Grand, has little interest in him and dismisses him as a &#x27;rich kid&#x27;. The character has also appeared in issues of &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot; and &quot;Simpsons Super Spectacular&quot;, and in the 1992 video game &quot;Bartman Meets Radioactive Man&quot;.
===Rainier Wolfcastle===
Rainier Luftwaffe Wolfcastle (voiced by Harry Shearer) is an action hero star and a close parody of Arnold Schwarzenegger. This basis has been drawn out over the series. Wolfcastle is a native of Austria, as is Schwarzenegger; he got his start as a child acting in national commercials, most notably for the bratwurst company Fritz Schnackenpfefferhausen. Wolfcastle&#x27;s wife is named Maria, just like the real Schwarzenegger&#x27;s former wife Maria Shriver, related to the Kennedy family. Maria is a member of the political Quimby dynasty. Like Schwarzenegger, Wolfcastle is an active member of the Republican Party and owns a Hummer. In the episode &quot;The Boy Who Knew Too Much&quot;, Bart Simpson tells Wolfcastle that his &quot;last movie really sucked&quot; (along with Chief Wiggum&#x27;s line of Magic Ticket&#x27; my ass, McBain!&quot;), alluding to Schwarzenegger&#x27;s then-recent film &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, which had been a disappointment at the box office. Wolfcastle owns a restaurant named Planet Springfield, a parody of Planet Hollywood, which Schwarzenegger co-owned with other celebrities. Wolfcastle has starred in many action movies, most notably the &quot;McBain&quot; series (a parody of action movies such as &quot;Die Hard&quot;) and the movie of &quot;Radioactive Man&quot;, a loose parody of the &quot;Batman&quot; television series. When clips of the &quot;McBain&quot; films are played in the order in which they aired, they form a mini-movie with a full storyline. The credits of the mini-movie had captions, &quot;But McBain will be back in &quot;You Have The Right To Remain DEAD&quot;&quot; parodying the early James Bond movies along with the style of music traditionally used in those films. Wolfcastle&#x27;s more recent movies have gained less renown, and he is even forced to do comedies. Wolfcastle has made appearances as an Academy Award presenter, a celebrity spokesperson, and a celebrity judge. In a recall election of Mayor Quimby, Wolfcastle ran for his seat. He has a daughter named Greta who had a crush on Bart in the episode &quot;The Bart Wants What It Wants&quot;.

The writers invented Wolfcastle as the action hero McBain for the episode &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; Because they liked the scene involving the character from that episode, they used him again in &quot;The Way We Was&quot;, which was recorded and aired before &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; The &quot;McBain&quot; films satirize clichés of action films. The character was originally named McBain, until an actual film called &quot;McBain&quot; was released in 1991. That film&#x27;s producers refused to allow the show to use the name, so &quot;Rainier Wolfcastle&quot; became the name of the actor playing the McBain role. Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson, doubles as Wolfcastle when Harry Shearer is absent from table reads.

In &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, a characterization of Arnold Schwarzenegger is the President of the United States. He is very similar to the design of Wolfcastle but with more wrinkles under his eyes and a different hairstyle.

===Ralph Wiggum===
===Reverend Lovejoy===
===Rich Texan===
Richard O&#x27;Hara, mainly known as The Rich Texan (voiced by Dan Castellaneta), is a stereotypical rich, callous but gregarious businessman and owner of the Springfield Atoms football team and the fictional &quot;Simpsons&quot; version of the Boston Celtics, which he lost to Mr. Burns in a poker game at Billionaire Camp in the episode &quot;The Burns and the Bees&quot;. He is an active member of the Springfield Republican Party and speaks with a heavy Texas drawl. His morality can wildly vary from episode to episode: sometimes selfish and sadistic, and at other times polite and friendly. In the fifth-season episode &quot;$pringfield&quot; (the Rich Texan&#x27;s debut, though a similar character once appeared in the season two episode &quot;Old Money&quot;), Homer addresses the Rich Texan as Senator, although this was never again referenced. Rich Texan sports a bolo tie and a white cowboy hat. He is also obsessive-compulsive, as revealed in &quot;The Seemingly Never-Ending Story&quot;. He claimed in &quot;Marge&#x27;s Son Poisoning&quot; that he enjoys moonlit walks on the beach; in the same episode he held Homer and Moe at gunpoint while forcing them to walk with him after the duo carried out a deception on him.

He is seen pulling out a pair of revolvers and firing them into the air while yelling &quot;Yee Haw!&quot; whenever he is happy or excited. He was briefly incarcerated due to one of his stray bullets hitting a Texas Ranger. He has a gay grandson, as revealed in &quot;Million Dollar Abie&quot; and a daughter named Paris Texan (who looks and acts like hotel heiress Paris Hilton). In the episode &quot;Havana Wild Weekend&quot; the Rich Texan says New Hampshire is his home state, and in &quot;Revenge Is a Dish Best Served Three Times&quot;, he is from Connecticut, despite his brash, stereotypically Southern persona (parodying the fact that although former president George H.W. Bush is most closely associated with Texas, he was actually born in Milton, Massachusetts). The popular culture perception of Lyndon B. Johnson also contributed to the Rich Texan&#x27;s characterization.

===Richard===
Richard (alternatively voiced by Nancy Cartwright, Jo Ann Harris, Pamela Hayden and Maggie Roswell) is a gray-haired student at Springfield Elementary School and is one of Bart&#x27;s friends. He is first seen in &quot;Bart the Genius&quot;. He is usually seen with his best friend Lewis and has a leather jacket and a shirt with a small diamond embroidered on the center. Richard appears frequently in scenes involving the Springfield children, and in the early seasons was often involved with mischief. In early seasons he and Lewis were commonly seen hanging out with Bart and Milhouse, but in recent years they are mostly seen in the classroom and in crowd scenes. He had a brief speaking part in &quot;The Haw-Hawed Couple&quot;, in which he was voiced by Pamela Hayden. His hair color changes from black to gray, to brown, and then to blue throughout the course of the show. However, in &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot;, his hair always appears gray.

===Rod Flanders===
Rodney &quot;Rod&quot; Flanders (voiced by Pamela Hayden in 1989–2025, Chris Edgerly since 2024) is Ned Flanders&#x27; ten-year-old son. Rod prays often; first thing in the morning and last thing before bed. He prays for God to watch over him and his younger brother, Todd, as well as for the success of his father&#x27;s business. He also prays for all of the other children like his neighbor Bart Simpson, who do not pray for themselves. Ned has described Rod&#x27;s hobbies as including &quot;being quiet during trips, clapping with songs and diabetes&quot;. Rod&#x27;s largest role was in &quot;Bart Has Two Mommies&quot;, where he obtains new climbing skills and rescues Bart from a chimpanzee atop a church. This episode also reveals that Rod thinks of Marge as the most fun he has had since his mother died.

In earlier episodes (&quot;When Flanders Failed&quot; and &quot;Dead Putting Society&quot;), Rod is overshadowed by his younger brother, who plays parts in both. In &#x27;Tis the Fifteenth Season&quot;, he mentions that he is &quot;jealous of girls &#x27;cause they get to wear dresses&quot;, suggesting nascent transvestism. In a &quot;freeze-frame gag&quot; in the episode &quot;Homer Badman&quot;, Rod is stated to be the younger Flanders child. In the flash-forward episode &quot;Bart to the Future&quot;, Flanders justifies lending Bart money as a gesture of goodwill due to Bart&#x27;s having apparently not outed Rod and Todd as being gay. In later episodes, Rod seems to have developed a taste for comedy as he has had a habit of watching comedy shows and during the 34th treehouse of horror episode, the second segment depicts him as a badmouthed prop comedian and in the next one, he is in church reading a magazine about Carrot Top.

===Roger Meyers Jr.===
Roger Meyers Jr. (voiced by Alex Rocco in 1990 and from 1996 to 1997, Hank Azaria from 1993 to 1994) is the current Chairman of I&amp;S Studios, and is the son of Roger Meyers Sr. He distributes the cartoon, which is frequently criticized by parents because of its violent nature. He is a jaded and selfish businessman who has nothing but contempt for the children who comprise his audience.

In the episode &quot;The Day the Violence Died&quot;, when I&amp;S Studios is bankrupted following their trial against Chester J. Lampwick and Bart and Lisa are too late in providing information that could save the company, he tells them condescendingly &quot;Great, mail it to last week when I might have cared. I&#x27;ve got cartoons to make.&quot;

He has an obnoxious and short tempered personality. This is displayed in his contempt for the writers of Itchy and Scratchy when Abe Simpson becomes the flavour of the month, going as far as physically abusing a fired writer and sending Lisa and Bart a letter filled with explicit and rude language in the process. And again when holding auditions for the voice of Poochie. After first hiring Otto, he then chooses Troy McClure, telling Otto, &quot;Take a hike you bum&quot;, when seconds earlier he was &quot;perfect&quot;.

In &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot;, he creates Poochie in an attempt to bring the show&#x27;s ratings back up. Homer is asked to voice Poochie, and does so. The show&#x27;s ratings plummet, and Poochie is despised. He is nearly killed off in the next episode (after only one appearance), but ends up being dubbed over to have returned to his own planet (and died on the way).

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; arcade game mobile, he appears as a boss in the Springfield Mall and uses an axe, a mallet, and bombs that look like Itchy and Scratchy.

===Ruth Powers===
Ruth Powers (voiced by Pamela Reed in &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot;, &quot;Marge on the Lam&quot;, &quot;Strong Arms of the Ma&quot;, and &quot;The Wayz We Were&quot;; Maggie Roswell in &quot;The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons&quot; and &quot;When You Dish Upon a Star&quot;; Pamela Hayden in other appearances) is the Simpsons&#x27; next-door neighbor, introduced when she moves to their neighborhood in the episode &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot;. She is divorced and has a daughter named Laura Powers. According to &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot;, Ruth divorced her husband because his career got in the way with his family life, but in &quot;Marge on the Lam&quot;, Ruth tells Marge that all her husband ever did was &quot;eat, sleep, and drink beer&quot; and never gave her money for child support (which led to Ruth stealing her husband&#x27;s convertible). She is usually seen as a background character, sometimes in events that occurred even before she moved next door (such as the baby shower for Maggie in &quot;And Maggie Makes Three&quot;). She even continues to be a background character despite her later imprisonment. She nearly always wears a red headscarf. In the episode &quot;The Cartridge Family&quot;, she was part of the NRA. David Mirkin said that Pamela Reed always would give great performances and that he does not know why they did not use her more.

The episode &quot;Marge on the Lam&quot; features Ruth and Marge going on the run from the law in a stolen convertible in a light parody of &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;. Ruth makes an appearance in the episode &quot;Strong Arms of the Ma&quot;, as a huge female bodybuilder, advising Marge (who is taking up weightlifting) to use steroids. It is also revealed in the episode that Ruth Powers went to jail and entered a beauty contest in which she was named &quot;Miss Mexican Mafia&quot;. Her daughter Laura has not been seen after &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot;. In &#x27;Tis the Fifteenth Season&quot; and The Wayz We Were&quot; she is shown still living next door to the Simpsons.

==S==
===Sam and Larry===
Sam and Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; Dalrymple (voiced by Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer respectively), also known as &quot;Barfly #1&quot; and &quot;Barfly #2&quot;, are two regular patrons of Moe&#x27;s Tavern. Their first appearance is in &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;. Virtually nothing is known about them, except that Sam, whose design is based on co-creator Sam Simon, always wears a cap and glasses and Larry has an orange jacket and a balding head and either looks extremely drunk or very depressed. Sam has spoken only a few times throughout the series; on the season three episode &quot;Lisa the Greek&quot;, Sam asks Homer what he bet on outcome of the Super Bowl, and in &quot;Radioactive Man&quot; he simultaneously says &quot;That makes sense&quot; to Moe, along with others at the bar, when Moe tells the barflies that the child actor who played Alfalfa that Moe killed was an orphan who was owned by the studio. In &quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot; Sam is shot in the back by Moe, for trying to pay in Sacagawea dollars. Larry also rarely speaks, except simultaneously with Sam, Barney Gumble and Homer Simpson in &quot;Radioactive Man&quot; and in fantasy sequences (in &quot;Marge Be Not Proud&quot;, Larry utters a garbled, &quot;Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year&quot; after Bart receives a soiled wig during Bart&#x27;s image of spending Christmas in juvenile hall and in &quot;Simpson Tide&quot;, Larry grumbles, &quot;This stupid machine took my money!&quot; when Apu was thinking of his loved one—in this case, his Kwik-E-Mart cigarette machine that steals money and does not dispense cigarettes).

Larry dies while drinking at the bar in &quot;Cremains of the Day&quot;. After his death, it is revealed that he had been smuggling sapphires for Fat Tony. He apparently considered the other regulars at Moe&#x27;s to be his best friends even though they knew very little about him. It is also revealed that Larry&#x27;s home address was 652 8th Avenue, enjoyed fishing and Larry told his mother, Iris Dalrymple, about the regulars being his best friends.

===Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon===
Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon (voiced by Harry Shearer) is Apu Nahasapeemapetilon&#x27;s younger brother and uncle of Apu&#x27;s eight children. He has a daughter named Pahusacheta (who performed in a beauty pageant) and a son named Jamshed (who, despite his young age, can wield a shotgun and run The Kwik-E-Mart when Apu is not there to do so). Sanjay has a wife, as he asked Apu to promise not to sleep with her if he dies (Apu&#x27;s response to this request was a cheery &quot;I promise nothing!&quot;). Sanjay was shown as Apu&#x27;s business partner at the Kwik-E-Mart in the earlier episodes. &quot;I&#x27;m with Cupid&quot; was his final speaking appearance until &quot;Covercraft&quot;.

However, he has appeared as a background character in &quot;Moe Letter Blues&quot;, &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot; (as pitcher for Fort Springfield), and &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;. Sanjay can also be seen in the season nine episode &quot;Dumbbell Indemnity&quot; on a sign outside &quot;Stu&#x27;s Disco&quot; that reads, &quot;You Must Be This Swarthy To Enter&quot;.

===Santa&#x27;s Little Helper===
===Sarah Wiggum===
Sarah Wiggum (née Kanneke, voiced by Pamela Hayden in most episodes, and Megan Mullally in &quot;Uncut Femmes&quot;, &quot;Poorhouse Rock&quot;, &quot;Lisa the Boy Scout&quot;, &quot;Iron Marge&quot; and &quot;Bart&#x27;s Brain&quot;) is the gentle wife of Chief Wiggum and mother of Ralph Wiggum. She first appeared in the fourth season episode &quot;Duffless&quot;. Like Bernice Hibbert and Martha Quimby, she is a background character who appears most frequently in a nonspeaking role. However, in &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot; she only ever says &quot;Clancy!&quot;, whether hit by or in Marge&#x27;s mob.

In the episode, &quot;A Star Is Born Again&quot;, at the Jellyfish Dance, Clancy mentions she was more beautiful at that moment than the day he arrested her, to which she giggles in reply. He then mentions he only planted the crystal meth on her so she would &quot;notice&quot; him so he has an excuse to arrest her and fall in love with her, despite not doing the crystal meth, any drugs, or any crimes in general. Sarah (according to Clancy) is his &quot;home force&quot; and he lovingly calls her &quot;Poppin&#x27; Fresh&quot;.

In the episode &quot;Grade School Confidential&quot;, she immediately dials the authorities to Clancy&#x27;s command. Ralph apparently gets his appearance from her, as the two look very similar. According to &quot;Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind&quot;, Marge does not like Sarah at all and tried to keep her from Homer&#x27;s cruise party. But in later episodes such as &quot;The Great Wife Hope&quot;, and &quot;The Devil Wears Nada&quot;, Sarah is seen with Marge in groups with other Springfield moms in outings or charity meetings, apparently making an effort to get to know her better.

In the episode &quot;Uncut Femmes&quot;, her only major role to date, she reveals her true self to Marge entirely different than what she was before, including flashbacks of how she and Clancy met, of which the story was heavily retconned from what was said previously. She was a professional criminal tasked with distracting Clancy, then a security guard, in the course of a heist gone wrong. In the present, she and Marge retrieve one of the stolen items from the heist and she eventually reveals her past to Clancy, who is intrigued by her history.

In the episode &quot;Poorhouse Rock&quot; Sarah is seen again in her new retconned voice and personality, but is in the original character design in a guest appearance. In one of the unaired &quot;storylines&quot; leaked in the episode &quot;Lisa the Boy Scout&quot;, Clancy confronts Sarah for cheating on him with Eddie the cop, who is revealed to be the actual father of Ralph. In this appearance, she acted like her old self when it comes to her mannerisms.

===Scott Christian===
Scott Christian (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is a newsreader from the early seasons of the show. Christian and Kent Brockman shared the anchor desk equally, but eventually Brockman started to become the more commonly used anchor. In his final appearances, Christian was used mostly when Kent was in the field and an introduction was needed. His final speaking appearance was &quot;The Boy Who Knew Too Much&quot;, save for one syllable in &quot;Radioactive Man&quot;.

Christian was supposed to be permanent anchor, always filling in for an absent Brockman, but was quickly phased out as the show progressed. He briefly appeared (with red colored hair) with the other Springfield celebrities in the season 18 episode &quot;Homerazzi&quot; and made an appearance in &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Criticize Dinner?&quot;.

He reappears, then dies in &quot;Burger Kings&quot;.

He was back in &quot;Cremains of the Day&quot;.

===Sea Captain===
Captain Horatio McCallister (voiced by Hank Azaria), more commonly known as &quot;The Sea Captain&quot;, created by Conan O&#x27;Brien. His character is based on the stereotype of sailors and pirates, including the stereotypical pirate catchphrase, &quot;Yarr!&quot; He is a member of the Springfield Alcoholics Anonymous and has a peg leg in which he keeps liquor. In &quot;The Bart of War&quot; he uses his wooden leg to have a vicious sword fight with Sideshow Mel&#x27;s bone. He is commonly referred to simply as &quot;the Sea Captain&quot;, though when he took the witness stand in &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot;, Lionel Hutz clearly addresses him as &quot;Captain McCallister&quot;.

The Sea Captain is always seen holding a corncob pipe and squinting (because he has at least one glass eye, though once he was seen tapping both of his eyes, stating he has two glass eyes). He also has an artificial leg. As an entrepreneur, McCallister is equally incompetent. On several occasions, he acknowledges his incompetence with a depressed: &quot;Yarr, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doin&#x27;.&quot; Although he once states under oath (in &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot;) that he is not a real sea captain, at various occasions in later episodes he is indeed shown captaining a ship (even though &quot;Bart&#x27;s Girlfriend&quot; revealed that he &quot;...hate[s] the sea and everything in it&quot; during the part where he watches ships crash). His restaurant, &quot;The Frying Dutchman&quot;, is a failing business venture that does not generate enough income to support its owner. During the episode &quot;Mr. Plow&quot;, the Captain pitches his 90 track sea shanties CD set in a commercial, which aired on public-access television cable TV channel 92. In the episode &quot;Lisa Gets an &#x27;A&#x27;, the captain appears as a penniless bum. When seeing Homer and Marge walking Homer&#x27;s pet lobster at the beach, he approaches them and claims that he runs a &quot;small academy for lobsters&quot;. However, when Marge refuses to send the lobster away to &quot;some snobby boarding school&quot;, McCallister asks her for spare change instead. It is implied that he may be bisexual; in the episode &quot;A Star Is Born Again&quot;, he responds to what he believes as Ned Flanders showing interest in him with, &quot;Are you hitting on me? Because I don&#x27;t do that...on land.&quot;

His only main roles were in episodes &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot; and in &quot;The Wettest Stories Ever Told&quot;. In the former, Homer sues his restaurant, The Frying Dutchman, because they kicked him out at the restaurant&#x27;s closing time before Homer had eaten all he could eat. In the latter, he cannot bring the Simpsons their food for numerous reasons like the &quot;chef having problems with tonight&#x27;s special&quot;, which was an octopus. He then ignores the family while playing pickup basketball games with the restaurant&#x27;s staff.

Azaria modeled the voice on Robert Newton, who played pirates in several movies. The writers&#x27; &quot;love of sea talk&quot; is what inspired them to invent the Sea Captain.

===Shauna Chalmers===
Shauna Chalmers (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is a rebellious, promiscuous teenager who is Superintendent Chalmers&#x27; daughter. She is usually portrayed as Jimbo&#x27;s girlfriend, but in &quot;The D&#x27;oh-cial Network&quot;, she apparently sent a message to everybody promising to make out with them.

In &quot;Beware My Cheating Bart&quot;, she has a relationship with Bart.

In &quot;Girls Just Shauna Have Fun&quot;, she and Lisa discover that they have a shared passion of playing instruments.

===Sherri and Terri===
Sherri and Terri Mackleberry (both voiced by Russi Taylor from season 1 to 30, Tress MacNeille in &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge&quot;, Grey DeLisle since season 31) are identical twin sisters with long purple hair and pale skin. They perpetually reinforce their identities as twins, with things such as making up their own &quot;twin&quot; language. They are in the same class as Bart at Springfield Elementary School. In &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot; it is revealed that their father is Homer&#x27;s supervisor at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He fires Homer for causing an accident while waving to Bart from a cart during a school tour of the plant. Homer, however, has the last laugh when he is promoted above the twins&#x27; father to safety inspector by his boss Mr. Burns. Their mother is shown in &quot;Bart Sells His Soul&quot; and looks just like her daughters. Sherri is two seconds older than Terri; they share their birthday with Rod Flanders. In one episode when it seemed as if Springfield was going to be lost in a nuclear explosion, it was Sherri—rather than Terri—who was picked for survival by Principal Skinner.

The girls themselves dress identically, reinforcing their &quot;twin-ness&quot;. They are quite rude and snobbish, and never miss an opportunity to berate Bart and make fun of Lisa. Bart appears to have a crush on one of them, as admitted in &quot;Hungry, Hungry Homer&quot;. Sherri referred to Bart as an ugly, smelly dork, but was persuaded by Homer to go on a date with Bart after he told her that she could not do much better. Sherri stated that Terri had a crush on Bart in &quot;Bart Star&quot;. Another time, in &quot;Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder&quot;, Homer openly addressed Sherri as &quot;the girl Bart has a crush on&quot;. In &quot;The Way We Weren&#x27;t&quot;, they introduce a cousin who has a crush on Bart. In &quot;The Blue and the Gray&quot;, it was revealed that they were actually conjoined triplets, and that the third triplet is seeking revenge. The third triplet is seen by Marge in &quot;The Daughter Also Rises&quot;, but they suggest that she may only be hallucinating. In &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Substitute&quot;, they nominate Bart as the class president.

===Sideshow Bob===
===Sideshow Mel===
Melvin Van Horne, better known as Sideshow Mel (voiced by Dan Castellaneta), is Krusty the Clown&#x27;s sidekick. He replaced Sideshow Bob after Bob was incarcerated for framing Krusty for armed robbery. Mel&#x27;s hiring was never explicitly shown in the series and his full name was only revealed when he announced himself while trying to solve the mystery of who shot Mr. Burns in the episode &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)&quot; and in the episode &quot;All About Lisa&quot; on the portrait of Sideshow Mel in the past. He first appeared in &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge&quot;, shortly after Sideshow Bob was sent to prison, filling the exact role that Bob once did. Little is known about Mel. He is a Cornell University graduate, and a former &quot;Gulp &#x27;n Blow&quot; employee (during the time that Krusty&#x27;s show was cancelled, and Bart and Lisa set out to create a comeback special). Sideshow Mel is revealed, in the episode entitled &quot;All About Lisa&quot;, to have been the winner of the prestigious Springfield Entertainer of the Year award. The intoxication of applause made him reduce himself to ridiculous behavior for laughter, which he compared to doing heroin and checking email. Sideshow Mel uses a slide whistle to communicate on camera, just like Bob. When not in character, Mel speaks in a grandiose English/Received Pronunciation accent (Castellaneta&#x27;s play on Kelsey Grammer&#x27;s character, Sideshow Bob) and owns poodles. When Springfield inhabitants form an angry mob, Mel often takes a leading role. Mel wears a bone in his hair that has been used as a weapon. In &quot;22 Short Films About Springfield&quot;, Mel reveals that he got the bone stuck in his hair by trying to dig gum out with it. In &quot;Homerazzi&quot; it was revealed that Mel was in a bitter custody battle and that he has a son, who looks just like him except without a bone in his hair. In &quot;I&#x27;m with Cupid&quot;, he reveals he has a wife named Barbara, who appears in &quot;Realty Bites&quot; where they are bowling in a house that Marge tries to sell to them. She is revealed to be giving birth in the episode &quot;All About Lisa&quot;, suggesting that Mel has at least two children. She looks like a European woman, and has light hair. It has been suggested that Mel is very wealthy, able to afford betting thousands of dollars on football regularly.

Sideshow Mel is often subject to abuse by Krusty, just as Sideshow Bob was before him. Such occurrences include &#x27;Krusty&#x27;s Slide&#x27;, where he is forced into a mixture of pudding, pickle brine and laundry detergent, a tub of rancid Béarnaise sauce and a tub of refried beans; another unseen one is in &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot; where he states that Krusty once poured liquid nitrogen down his pants and cracked his buttocks with a hammer. In the episode &quot;Day of the Jackanapes&quot;, it is shown that Krusty can remember Sideshow Bob&#x27;s name, but not Sideshow Mel&#x27;s.

===Snake===
Chester Turley or Albert Knickerbocker Aloysius Snake (voiced by Hank Azaria), better known as Snake or Jailbird, is a recurring character who is Springfield&#x27;s resident recidivist felon, always getting arrested but rarely staying in jail. He made his debut appearance in &quot;The War of the Simpsons&quot; in which he was not named but wore the prisoner ID 7F20, matching the episode&#x27;s production code.

His first name was first mentioned by his cellmate Sideshow Bob in the season 3 episode &quot;Black Widower&quot;. In the script, the writers had simply mentioned a character named Snake and it had been the directors who had assigned that existing character design to the name. Snake was named the 19th (out of 25) of IGN&#x27;s Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters.

===Snowball II===

Snowball II is the Simpson family&#x27;s pet cat. The first Snowball II debuted in &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;, and died in the episode &quot;I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot&quot;, where she was later replaced by a cat Lisa named with the same name.

===Sophie Krustofsky===
Sophie Krustofsky (voiced by Drew Barrymore in &quot;Insane Clown Poppy&quot;, Natasha Lyonne in later appearances) is the illegitimate daughter of Krusty and a Gulf War veteran who debuts in &quot;Insane Clown Poppy&quot; when she meets her father for the first time and though he loses her trust by gambling away her violin, both Krusty and Homer work together to get it back. She makes a minor reappearance in &quot;Marge Gamer&quot;. Later she has major appearances in &quot;The Nightmare After Krustmas&quot; where she wants to spend Christmas with her father despite the fact the difference in their religious faiths (as she was raised a Christian unlike Krusty who was Jewish) to where Krusty almost converts to Christianity, and &quot;E My Sports&quot;, where she participates in an esports game as a member of Bart&#x27;s team. In &quot;When Nelson Met Lisa&quot;, set in a possible future, she is shown in a relationship with Jimbo, with both ending up getting married.

===Squeaky-Voiced Teen===
Squeaky-Voiced Teen (voiced by Dan Castellaneta), a.k.a. Pimple-Faced Teen, real name Jeremy Friedman or Steve Friedman, is one of few teenagers on the show and is perpetually trapped in a series of entry-level jobs, usually working at Krusty Burger (as a cashier, a cook, or, in the case of &quot;Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy&quot;, a supervisor in charge of training new employees), the grocery store (as a bagboy as seen in &quot;Selma&#x27;s Choice&quot; and &quot;Simpson Safari&quot;), or at a movie theater (as either a ticket master in &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy: The Movie&quot;, a concession stand clerk in &quot;E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)&quot;, or an usher in &quot;Jaws Wired Shut&quot;; in the video game &quot;The Simpsons: Road Rage&quot; he also talks about cleaning out the urinals). The Squeaky Voiced Teen has acne, and his voice is in the process of breaking. While the Squeaky Voiced Teen&#x27;s personality is seemingly shy and awkward, he does appear to have a notable degree of peer popularity, as he has been shown to score or at least get along with girls on several instances. He is often concerned about others and usually reports them to his boss; however, when he very rarely is the boss himself, he seizes opportunity and becomes stubborn and evil. Beginning with &quot;Team Homer&quot;, it is revealed that the Squeaky-Voiced Teen&#x27;s mother is Lunchlady Doris (who disowns him after he mentions that he cannot give a bowling lane to his own mother on League Night).

Castellaneta lifted his voice for the character from actor Richard Crenna&#x27;s as Walter Denton in the sitcom &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;. Several different models of Squeaky-Voiced Teen have been used throughout the series, featuring counterparts in Mexico, Australia, and England. Steven Dean Moore uses them all as waiters at the ice cream parlor the Simpsons eat at in &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge&quot;. Matt Groening called Squeaky-Voiced Teen his second favorite &quot;unnamed&quot; character after Comic Book Guy, whose name was finally revealed to be &quot;Jeff Albertson&quot; in the episode &quot;Homer and Ned&#x27;s Hail Mary Pass&quot;. He is also seen in the pre-show of The Simpsons Ride as one of the ride operators.

===Stampy===
Stampy is a male African elephant first appearing in the episode &quot;Bart Gets an Elephant&quot;. Bart wins the elephant in a radio contest called &quot;KBBL Is Gonna Gimme Something Stupid&quot;. As a prize, Bart was offered either an elephant or $10,000 in cash, with the elephant option as a joke. Bill and Marty had anticipated all winners would opt for the cash and were caught off guard when Bart chose the elephant. With the prospect of being fired looming, they eventually get Bart an elephant. Bart decides to name the elephant Stampy, who soon starts to cause trouble and costs a large amount of money in upkeep. Anxious to escape this, Homer offers Stampy to a wildlife reserve. However, on his realization that he will get nothing in return, he elects to sell Stampy to local poacher and ivory dealer, Mr. Blackheart. Homer later changes his mind after Stampy rescues him from a tar pit. Stampy likes peanuts and putting people in his mouth. He does not like other elephants, as can be seen when he is first introduced to the wildlife reserve.

Stampy is alluded to in other episodes. At Apu&#x27;s wedding, Bart sees Apu riding an elephant. Bart comments that he wishes that he had an elephant. Lisa responds, &quot;You did. His name was Stampy. You loved him.&quot; Bart simply replies, &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; Stampy also appears in &quot;Miracle on Evergreen Terrace&quot; in Bart&#x27;s water dream, and made a second (and more important) appearance on season 14&#x27;s &quot;Large Marge&quot;, where he was involved in an attempt to restore the public opinion of Krusty the Clown. Stampy also attacks a bear in the final scene of &quot;The Fat and the Furriest&quot;, but then the bear fights back by hitting Stampy on the head with a club several times, much to Stampy&#x27;s dismay. Stampy also appears in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, where he cracks the dome that covers Springfield, prompting the government&#x27;s drastic decision to implement Option No. 4 as a solution to the Springfield Problem.

===State Comptroller Atkins===
State Comptroller Atkins (voiced by Hank Azaria in later appearances, Karl Wiedergott in &quot;We’re on the Road to D’ohwhere&quot;) is the comptroller of Springfield&#x27;s state. In &quot;Lisa Gets an &#x27;A&#x27; he is sent to deliver the basic assistance grant to Springfield Elementary after Lisa cheats on a test and raises the school&#x27;s GPA up to the state&#x27;s minimum requirement. Otto&#x27;s impersonation of Atkins suggests that he is of Canadian origin. He appears later in &quot;Saddlesore Galactica&quot;, where he moderates the elementary school band competition at the state fair. He plans to give Lisa the unusually large good sportsmanship award until he hears her brand the first-place band &quot;cheaters&quot; for using glow-sticks in their performance.

Atkins&#x27; most recent appearance was in &quot;Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts&quot; where he gives Chalmers his job back.

He is also on Lisa&#x27;s list of &quot;interesting adults&quot; in &quot;Moe&#x27;N&#x27;a Lisa&quot;.

===Steve Mobbs===
Steve Mobbs (voiced by Hank Azaria) was the founder of Mapple and is a parody of Steve Jobs. He appeared in &quot;Mypods and Broomsticks&quot;. When Mobbs was giving an announcement, Bart played a prank and made it look like he was insulting his customers.

He also appears in &quot;A Tree Grows in Springfield&quot; where he is dead and shows off the MyPad in heaven. Steve Mobbs&#x27; death is a reference to when Steve Jobs died.

===Superintendent Chalmers===
Superintendent Garibaldi &quot;Gary&quot; Chalmers (voiced by Hank Azaria) is the superintendent of Springfield&#x27;s school district. He first appears in the episode &quot;Whacking Day&quot;. Chalmers is strict and humorless, with a short temper and low tolerance for disorder or rule-breaking. He is also the father of Shauna Chalmers.

Whenever Chalmers visits Springfield Elementary, some sort of disaster strikes. He produces extreme anxiety in Principal Skinner, who offers increasingly improbable excuses for the problems. As a running gag, despite his antipathy towards Skinner and his initial skepticism, Chalmers will still wind up accepting Skinner&#x27;s desperate explanations. Chalmers is known for throwing open the doors to the room and bellowing &quot;SEYMOUR!!!&quot; or &quot;SKINNER!!!&quot;, to which Skinner stammers &quot;S-Superintendent Chalmers!&quot; His catchphrase has caused some paranoia in Skinner (as seen in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Date with Density&quot;). On a few occasions, he says Skinner&#x27;s name this way when absolutely nothing has gone wrong, implying that he either pronounces Skinner&#x27;s name this way by habit, or does it on purpose to scare him. In &quot;Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words&quot;, he even pronounces the words &quot;skimmer&quot; and &quot;dinner&quot; in a similar manner to Skinner&#x27;s name, who mistakes it as Chalmers wanting his attention.

However, Chalmers does on at least two occasions show a fondness for Skinner. In &quot;The Debarted&quot;, both Skinner and Chalmers are lost in the foam of a massive explosion resulting from the mixture of Mentos and Diet Coke, he screams Skinner&#x27;s name and upon not receiving an answer, says it again in a softer manner. Skinner then replies to which Chalmers tells him in a frightened voice, &quot;Don&#x27;t ever scare me like that again.&quot; In &quot;How Munched is That Birdie in the Window?&quot;, when Edna uses a pigeon to taunt Skinner about how much better her life is without him, Chalmers shows compassion for Skinner until Edna reveals that she had an affair with Chalmers, leaving Skinner angry and forcing Chalmers to flee. In &quot;Lisa Simpson, This Isn&#x27;t Your Life&quot;, it is revealed that Chalmers has nothing personal against Skinner and that he is aware that the antics within the school are a result of the students&#x27; reckless nature and the teachers&#x27; indifference, but scolds Skinner because he would have to face the ire of the parents or of the teachers&#x27; union otherwise, and because he likes Groundskeeper Willie.

Chalmers&#x27; own competence and dedication to his job are questionable. He lets Ned Flanders allow the school to descend into anarchy when Flanders is principal, freely admitting that he had fired Skinner for far less, explaining simply that &quot;Skinner really bugged me.&quot; He seems disturbingly unconcerned with the school&#x27;s decline, stating that American public schools are already on the decline and will most likely end up just like Springfield Elementary (or worse) and tells Bart to sit back and enjoy the ride (though Chalmers does ultimately fire Flanders for mentioning God in a public school). He also promotes people based on personal bias as opposed to actual competence, promoting Principal Holloway, described by Skinner as a &quot;drunk&quot; and by Chalmers as a &quot;pill-popper&quot;, to assistant superintendent after getting run over by a tractor driven by Bart and blaming Skinner for letting it happen.

Chalmers&#x27; first name is revealed to be Gary in &quot;Yokel Chords&quot; and in &quot;Wild Barts Can&#x27;t Be Broken&quot; it is revealed that he is a Spanish immigrant named &quot;Señor Chalmers&quot;. In the episode &quot;Replaceable You&quot;, it is implied that Chalmers wears a toupee (according to Dolph&#x27;s science project, a toupee detector). In the episode &quot;22 Short Films About Springfield&quot;, he mentions he is from Utica, New York, though in &quot;The Old Man and the &#x27;C&#x27; Student&quot; he says that he was born in Queens, New York. He has also mentioned that he attended Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, after which he moved to Intercourse, Pennsylvania. In several episodes, such as &quot;Bart the Fink&quot;, Chalmers is seen dating Agnes Skinner (much to Seymour&#x27;s chagrin), although in other episodes, he mentions he is married. In &quot;Pranksta Rap&quot;, he takes a job as a bodyguard for rapper Alcatraaz, but only because his wife is really sick. In &quot;Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts&quot;, Chalmers mentions that he was once married and is now a widower, implying his wife died from her illness.

&quot;Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts&quot; is the first (and so far only) episode in which Superintendent Chalmers is given a protagonist role. In the episode, Chalmers is challenged by Principal Skinner to get Bart interested in learning, and finds it in the form of teaching him about Theodore Roosevelt. After an unauthorized school field trip, Chalmers is fired for letting Nelson fall off a cliff, but is re-hired and given the title of Super-Duper-Intendent. In &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, in addition to appearances in crowd scenes Superintendent Chalmers is shown in attendance at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting on Day 97 under the Dome. He is one of those who panics when a book thrown from outside the meeting room smashes through a window and knocks over the Bunn-type coffee maker, apparently destroying the last of AA&#x27;s coffee supply in Springfield.

In the DVD commentaries to &quot;22 Short Films About Springfield&quot; and &quot;Grade School Confidential&quot;, it is noted that Superintendent Chalmers seems to be one of the few &quot;normal&quot; characters on the show and is frequently alone in his awareness of the show&#x27;s zaniness (much like one-shot character Frank Grimes from &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot;).

===Surly Duff===
Surly Duff (voiced by Hank Azaria) is a mascot for Duff and one of the seven duffs. He first appears in &quot;Selma&#x27;s Choice&quot; and has appeared multiple times since.

==T==
===Todd Flanders===
Todd Homer Flanders (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) is Ned Flanders&#x27; eight-year-old son, who according to the episode &quot;Manger Things&quot; was born six years ago. His middle name is Homer because Homer helped deliver him when Ned could not get there on time. His voice is based on Sherman&#x27;s from &quot;Peabody and Sherman&quot;. Todd is the most impressionable member of the Flanders family. When exposed to profanity, he himself starts to curse (&quot;Hell, no&quot; and &quot;I said I don&#x27;t want any damn vegetables&quot;). When Moe Szyslak loses his temper at Uncle Moe&#x27;s Family Feedbag, Todd responds with &quot;Ow, my freaking ears!&quot; prompting the Flanders to leave, after Ned comments that Moe&#x27;s foul language is more at home at Denny&#x27;s (in most international versions, &quot;Denny&#x27;s&quot; is replaced with &quot;McDonald&#x27;s&quot;). Whether due to immaturity or a means to break away from his parents&#x27; (his father&#x27;s especially) relentless sheltering, whenever Todd comes into contact with anything outside his family and their pious ways, such as the time he was tricked into eating a Pixy Stix by Bart Simpson, he turns aggressive. Todd can play the violin quite well, and is a part of the Springfield Elementary School band (despite that later episodes do not show Rod or Todd Flanders as Springfield Elementary School students, before it was revealed that they attended a Christian school before their new step-mother Edna Krabappel enrolled them in Springfield Elementary). &quot;Dead Putting Society&quot; reveals that Todd is good at mini-golf and capable (presumably unlike his brother) to defy his father. However, he is much less willing than Bart.

===Troy McClure===
;

==U==
===Üter Zörker===
Üter Zörker (voiced by Russi Taylor) is an overweight German foreign exchange student with a sweet tooth, and strange habits such as offering his already-licked lollipops to others as a sign of friendship, and eating marzipan candies (called &quot;Joy Joy&quot;) fortified with iodine. He was left behind on the Civil War field trip, according to the season six episode &quot;The PTA Disbands&quot;, but was back in school, playing in the band in the season eight episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Date with Density&quot;. His subsequent disappearance from the show for a significant period of time has become a running joke. In &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Criticize Dinner?&quot; his biological parents from Germany asked Skinner where their missing son was, and in &quot;24 Minutes&quot; he is seen stuck in a cobweb in the school air vents. It is revealed in the episode &quot;Jazzy and the Pussycats&quot; that he can play the trumpet quite well. He even makes a &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; diorama, but eats it before it can be graded in &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Rival&quot;. During the school science fair in the season 23 episode &quot;Replaceable You&quot; Kearney has a human skull on display with a sign on it that reads, &quot;Is This Üter?&quot; In the German dub of the show, Üter is an exchange student from Switzerland.

==V==
===The Vanderbilts===
The Vanderbilts (voiced by Harry Shearer in &quot;Saddlesore Galactica&quot;, Hank Azaria in later appearances and Tress MacNeille) are an elderly rich couple who are frequently shocked by Homer Simpson&#x27;s antics. They first appear in &quot;Saddlesore Galactica&quot; where Mr. Vanderbilt breaks his monocle after being shocked. This gag is reused in &quot;A Tale of Two Springfields&quot;. In &quot;Homer vs. Dignity&quot;, Mrs. Vanderbilt is shocked by Homer&#x27;s antics twice. In &quot;The Frying Game&quot;, Mrs. Vanderbilt is shown as friends with Mrs. Bellamy, Mrs. Glick, and Agnes Skinner. They are a parody of the actual Vanderbilt family.

==W==
===Warden===

The Warden (voiced by Charles Napier) is the unnamed prison warden of both Springfield Prison and Springfield Juvenile Hall.

He first appears in the episode &quot;Pokey Mom&quot; as the announcer of the Springfield Prison rodeo, as well as sitting in on Jack Crowley&#x27;s parole hearing. He is shown as a very strict bureaucrat, and has little compassion for the prisoners under his control. He releases Crowley into Marge&#x27;s care after she vouches for him.

He reappears in &quot;The Wandering Juvie&quot;, now in charge of the juvenile detention center, which he runs just like a prison.

A sign in his office reads &quot;HIS JUDGEMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON&quot;, which is a reference to the sign in Warden Norton&#x27;s office from &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;.

===Waylon Smithers===
===The Weasels===
The Weasels are fraternal twin bullies at Springfield Elementary School and Nelson&#x27;s henchmen despite being in the 2nd grade with Lisa Simpson. They first appeared in &quot;Bart the General&quot;. They are almost identical except for their skin colors (one is white and the other is black) and their outfits. The White Weasel (voiced by Susan Blu in &quot;Bart the General&quot; and Nancy Cartwright in later appearances) wears a red T-shirt, tan shorts, and red shoes and the Black Weasel (voiced by Jo Ann Harris in &quot;Bart the General&quot; and Pamela Hayden in later appearances) wears an orange T-shirt, tan shorts, and orange shoes with tan soles (although in his first appearance, his outfit was a yellow T-shirt, green shorts, and yellow shoes with green soles). While only continuing to serve Nelson on very rare instances after much earlier seasons, the Weasels still appear frequently throughout the series, sometimes in scenes involving the other bullies yet primarily as background characters, especially in Lisa&#x27;s 2nd grade class. During the episode &quot;The Winter of His Content&quot;, it is revealed that the Weasels now attend Shelbyville Elementary School. In following appearances however, they still occasionally appear among the children of Springfield.

===Wendell Borton===
Wendell Borton (alternatively voiced by Jo Ann Harris, Pamela Hayden, Nancy Cartwright, Russi Taylor and Grey DeLisle) is a perpetually nauseated and very pale boy with worried eyes and curly hair. He first appears in &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;, although his first speaking appearance is in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;. He becomes especially sick on field trips, with a tendency to become even paler than usual. He makes frequent appearances at the school nurse&#x27;s office at Springfield Elementary School. A classmate of Bart Simpson, Wendell is most often seen with classmates Richard, Lewis, and Martin. He was the only kid to support Martin Prince, when the latter ran against Bart for class president. He is one of the few characters whose hair is the same color as his skin. In an episode error, he is called Wendell Queasly in &quot;Yellow Subterfuge.&quot;

===The Winfields===
The Winfields are an elderly couple who live next door to the Simpson family early in the series and often complain about how crude and uncivilized the Simpsons are. Mr. Winfield&#x27;s (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) first name is unknown and Mrs. Winfield&#x27;s first name is Sylvia (voiced by Russi Taylor in &quot;Homer’s Odyssey”, Tracey Ullman in &quot;Bart&#x27;s Dog Gets an &quot;F&quot;, Maggie Roswell in later appearances). They first appear in the season one episode &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;. The couple appear in the season two episodes &quot;Simpson and Delilah&quot; and &quot;Bart&#x27;s Dog Gets an &quot;F&quot;, as well as the season three episode &quot;Separate Vocations&quot;. The couple eventually move to Florida in the season four episode &quot;New Kid on the Block&quot; and have not been seen since.

===Wiseguy===
Raphael (voiced by Hank Azaria, Dan Castellaneta in &quot;500 Keys&quot;), a.k.a. Wiseguy, is the chauffeur hired to take Homer to the prom (despite that Marge was going with Artie Ziff) in the second season in &quot;The Way We Was&quot;, but he has held numerous other jobs in the series. &quot;Simpsons&quot; sound editor Bob Beecher commented on alt.tv.simpsons that, &quot;He doesn&#x27;t have &quot;one&quot; name. His character&#x27;s name always fits the scene so he&#x27;s gone by many names, &#x27;Clerk&#x27;, &#x27;Shopkeeper&#x27;, etc. But in the script the direction given to the voice is &#x27;Wiseguy Voice&#x27;. So call him &#x27;Wiseguy&#x27; if you want.&quot;

Azaria does a Charles Bronson impression for the voice. In &quot;Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious&quot;, Al Jean and Mike Reiss had Azaria voice a Simpsonized Charles Bronson as a reference to this. Like his profession, the character&#x27;s hair and facial features varied widely for a number of years, with the voice being the only constant; eventually, he was standardized as a balding, greying man with a moustache. Wiseguy has been dubbed &quot;The Sarcastic Middle-Aged Man&quot; by the show&#x27;s Internet fans. In &quot;Day of the Jackanapes&quot;, Sideshow Bob calls Wiseguy by the name &quot;Raphael&quot;.

==Y==
===Yes Guy===

The Frank Nelson Type (voiced by Dan Castellaneta), also known as &quot;The Yes Guy&quot;, first appeared in season ten&#x27;s episode &quot;Mayored to the Mob&quot; as the maître d&#x27;hôtel at the Springfield Dinner Theater. He is a character known for bellowing &quot;Ye-e-e-s?!&quot; in a falling, then rising intonation, and appears to be highly eccentric in both his speech and appearance. The Yes Guy is a tribute to Frank Nelson, a supporting actor in &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, and &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, whose trademark greeting in all his characters was a loud, drawn-out &quot;Ye-e-e-s?!&quot; Nelson was inexplicably found working behind the service counter of whatever shop Benny or Fred Sanford might be patronizing, and his Springfield counterpart is similar.

In the Yes Guy&#x27;s first appearance, Homer asks why his voice is always stretched, and the Yes Guy replies by saying &quot;I had a stro-o-o-oke&quot;. He also appears in &quot;Homer vs. Dignity&quot;. He works at Costington&#x27;s department store, as an executioner at Springfield Penitentiary, and is juror number twelve of the Springfield jury. Homer refers to him as &quot;that jerk that goes &#x27;Ye-e-e-es?. A Brazilian version of him was seen in &quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot;, uttering &quot;Si-i-i-m?!&quot; (&quot;Yes&quot; in Portuguese).

In a deleted scene of &quot;The Dad Who Knew Too Little&quot;, his surname is revealed to be Pettigrew, but this has not been confirmed in any canonical scene.

<doc id="292280" wikidata="Q1508510" url="?curid=292280" title="Perforation">
<text>A perforation is a small hole in a thin material or web. There is usually more than one perforation in an organized fashion, where all of the holes collectively are called a &quot;perforation&quot;. The process of creating perforations is called perforating, which involves removing bits of the workpiece with a tool. Old-fashioned lick-and-stick postage stamps are perforated. When a tool makes small cuts in the material (without removing anything) it is called &#x27;rouletting&#x27;, because that tool often resembles a roulette wheel, with blades around the edge. Raffle tickets are a good example of rouletting.

Perforations are usually used to allow easy separation of two sections of the material, such as allowing paper to be torn easily along the line. Packaging with perforations in paperboard or plastic film is easy for consumers to open. Other purposes include filtrating fluids, sound deadening, allowing light or fluids to pass through, and to create an aesthetic design.

Various applications include plastic films to allow the packages to breathe, medical films, micro perforated plate and sound and vapor barriers.

==Processes==
===Pins and needles===

Rotary pinned perforation rollers are precision tools that can be used to perforate a wide variety of materials. The pins or needles can be used cold or heated. Cold perforation tools include needle punches.

There are a handful of manufacturers that specialize in hot and cold needle perforation tooling and equipment. In materials that have elasticity this can result in a &quot;volcano&quot; hole that is preferred in many applications.

Pinned rollers can be made from a variety of materials, including plastic, steel, and aluminum.

In more brittle films, cold perforation can cause slitting rather than creating a round hole, which can jeopardize the material&#x27;s integrity under pressure. The solution to this is often heating the pin; i.e. hot pin perforation. Hot perforation melts a hole in the material, causing a reinforced ring around the hole. Hot needle perforation also assists when high density pin patterns are utilized, as the heat aids the perforation of the material.

===Die and punch===
Die and punch sets can be used for thicker materials or materials that require large holes; this process is the most common for metalworking. The workpiece is sheared by pressing (either by machine or hand tool) the punch through the workpiece and into the die. The middle section of the workpiece is scrap; commonly known as the chad in paper and similar materials. The punch and die are shaped to produce the desired shaped hole. The clearance (the distance between the outside circumference of the punch and the inner circumference of the die) must be properly maintained to ensure a clean cut. Burrs are produced on the side of the workpiece that is against the die.

Common applications are fruit and vegetable bags, hole punching and ticket punching.

===Laser perforation===
Laser cutting can place many precise holes in a web. Laser perforations look similar in many respects to hot needle perforations. However, laser systems are expensive. The big advantage of laser perforation is the consistency of the hole size, compared to mechanical perforation. This is very important in modified atmosphere packaging for fresh produce. The laser perforation is often carried out on roll slitting machines (slitter rewinder) as the printed material is slit down to the finished roll size.

==Applications==
Perforation frequently refers to the practice of creating a long series of holes or slits so that paper or plastics can be torn more easily along a given line: this is used in easy-open packaging. Since the creation of perforation devices in the 1840s and 1850s, it has seen use in several areas.

Postage stamps are one common application of this, where small round holes are cut in lines to create individual pieces. Perforations on stamps are rather large, in the order of a millimeter, in comparison other perforated materials often have smaller holes.

It is common for cheque-books, notebooks and legal pads to have perforations making it easier to tear out individual pages or leaves. Perforation is used in ways to separate loose leaf (or even a form of graph paper from a ringed binder). A fine perforation next to the rings allows the page to be separated from the book with no confetti.

Screwcaps on glass or plastic bottles are sealed with a ring at the bottom of the cap attached by perforation. Twisting the cap has the effect of rupturing the material between the perforations and indicating that the original seal has been broken.
The edges of film stock are perforated to allow it to be moved precise distances at a time continuously. Similarly, punched cards for use in looms and later in computers input and output devices in some cases were perforated to ensure correct positioning of the card in the device, and to encode information.

Perforation of steel strips is used in the manufacture of some zesters and rasps.

Historically, perforation patterns other than linear were used to mark stamps. A series of patents had been issued in the late 19th century for perforation machines to be used on rail lines for ticketing. Libraries and private collections used similar perforating stamps to mark ownership of books. End sheets, title pages, and image plates were punched with the namesake of the collection. Today, similarly elaborate perforation patterns continue to be used in orienteering.

Bread bags for some bread often have micro-perforations in the plastic, which is supposed to keep the bread fresh by releasing excess moisture. Similarly, bags of concrete use small perforations to allow air to escape while they are being filled.

<doc id="292285" wikidata="Q188213" url="?curid=292285" title="State religion">
<text>A state religion (also called official religion) is a religion or creed officially endorsed by a sovereign state. A state with an official religion (also known as confessional state), while not a secular state, is not necessarily a theocracy. State religions are official or government-sanctioned establishments of a religion, where public spending on the maintenance of church property and clergy is unrestricted, but the state does not need to be under the legislative control of the clergy as it would be in a theocracy.

Official religions have been known throughout human history in almost all types of cultures, reaching into the Ancient Near East and prehistory. The relation of religious cult and the state was discussed by the ancient Latin scholar Marcus Terentius Varro, under the term of &quot;theologia civilis&quot; (). The first state-sponsored Christian denomination was the Armenian Apostolic Church, established in 301 CE. In Christianity, as the term &quot;church&quot; is typically applied to a place of worship for Christians or organizations incorporating such ones, the term &quot;state church&quot; is associated with Christianity as sanctioned by the government, historically the state church of the Roman Empire in the last centuries of the Empire&#x27;s existence, and is sometimes used to denote a specific modern national branch of Christianity. Closely related to state churches are ecclesiae, which are similar but carry a more minor connotation.

In the Middle East, the majority of states with a predominantly Muslim population have Islam as their official religion, though the degree of religious restrictions on citizens&#x27; everyday lives varies by country. Rulers of Saudi Arabia use religious power, while Iran&#x27;s secular presidents are supposed to follow the decisions of religious authorities since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Turkey, which also has Muslim-majority population, became a secular country after Atatürk&#x27;s Reforms, although unlike the Russian Revolution of the same time period, it did not result in the adoption of state atheism.

The degree to which an official national religion is imposed upon citizens by the state in contemporary society varies considerably; from high as in Saudi Arabia and Iran, to none at all as in Greenland, Denmark, England, Iceland, and Greece (in Europe, the state religion might be called in English, the established church).

==Types==
The degree and nature of state backing for denomination or creed designated as a state religion can vary. It can range from mere endorsement (with or without financial support) with freedom for other faiths to practice, to prohibiting any competing religious body from operating and to persecuting the followers of other sects. In Europe, competition between Catholic and Protestant denominations for state sponsorship in the 16th century evolved the principle &quot;Cuius regio, eius religio&quot; (states follow the religion of the ruler) embodied in the text of the treaty that marked the Peace of Augsburg in 1555. In England, Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534, being declared the Supreme Head of the Church of England, the official religion of England continued to be &quot;Catholicism without the Pope&quot; until after his death in 1547.

In some cases, an administrative region may sponsor and fund a set of religious denominations; such is the case in Alsace-Moselle in France under its local law, following the pre-1905 French concordatory legal system and patterns in Germany.

===State churches===

A state church (or &quot;established church&quot;) is a state religion established by a state for use exclusively by that state. In the case of a &quot;state church&quot;, the state has absolute control over the church, but in the case of a &quot;state religion&quot;, the church is ruled by an exterior body; for example, in the case of Catholicism, the Vatican has control over the church.

===Disestablishment===
Disestablishment is the process of repealing a church&#x27;s status as an organ of the state. In a state where an established church is in place, opposition to such a move may be described as antidisestablishmentarianism.

==Current states with a state religion==

===Buddhism===
Governments where Buddhism, either a specific form of it, or Buddhism as a whole, has been established as an official religion:
* Bhutan: The Constitution of Bhutan defines Tibetan Buddhism as the &quot;spiritual heritage of Bhutan&quot;. The Constitution is based on Buddhist philosophy. It also mandates that the Druk Gyalpo (King) should appoint the Je Khenpo and Dratshang Lhentshog (The Commission for Monastic Affairs).
* Cambodia: The Constitution declared Theravada Buddhism as the official religion of the country. About 98% of Cambodia&#x27;s population is Buddhist.
* Myanmar: Section 361 of the Constitution states that &quot;The Union recognizes the special position of Theravada Buddhism as the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens of the Union.&quot; The 1961 State Religion Promotion and Support Act requires the government to teach Buddhist lessons in schools, to give priority to Buddhist monasteries in founding of primary schools, to make Uposatha days holidays during Vassa months, to broadcast Buddhist sermons by State media on Uposatha days, and otherwise promote and support Buddhism as State Religion.
* Sri Lanka: The constitution of Sri Lanka states under Chapter II, Article 9, &quot;The Republic of Sri Lanka declares Theravada Buddhism as the state religion and accordingly it shall be the duty of the Head of State and Head of Government to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana&quot;.

In some countries, Buddhism is not recognized as a state religion, but holds special status:
* Thailand: Article 67 of the Constitution of Thailand states: The State should support and protect Buddhism [...] In supporting and protecting Buddhism, [...] the State should promote and support education and dissemination of dharmic principles of Theravada Buddhism [...], and shall have measures and mechanisms to prevent Buddhism from being undermined in any form. The State should also encourage Buddhists to participate in implementing such measures or mechanisms.
* Japan: As of 2022, around 70.8 million people, or about 67% of Japan&#x27;s total population identify as Buddhist. Japan has the second largest Buddhist population in the world, after China. The largest sects of Japanese Buddhism are Pure Land Buddhism with 22 million believers, followed by Nichiren Buddhism with 10 million believers, Shingon Buddhism with 5.4 million, Zen Buddhism with 5.3 million, Tendai Buddhism with 2.8 million, and only about 700,000 for the six old schools established in the Nara period.
* Laos: According to the Lao Constitution, Buddhism is given special privilege in the country. The state respects and protects all the lawful activities of Buddhism.
* Mongolia: The Emblem of Mongolia has multiple Buddhist symbols, including a Wheel of Dharma and the Three Jewels. The Buddha&#x27;s Birthday is also a public holiday in Mongolia. Moreover, the 100 tögrög coin depicts Janraisig Temple, a Buddhist monastery, on its obverse. 
* Kalmykia (Russia): The Kalmyk local government supports Tibetan Buddhism and also encourages Buddhist teachings and traditions. It also builds various Buddhist temples and sites. Various efforts are taken by the Government for the revival of Tibetan Buddhism in the republic.
* China: Chinese Buddhism is the largest institutionalized religion in mainland China. Buddhism is the largest officially recognized and the most prevalent religion in China. China is also the home to the largest Buddhist population in the world, Studies from 2023 suggest that there are around 470 million Buddhists in China, or about 33.4% of the country&#x27;s 1.4 billion residents. There are three main branches of Buddhism in China: Han or Chinese Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism, and Theravada Buddhism. There is no definitive answer to the time when Buddhism was first introduced to China, but it is generally believed that this occurred around the time of the Han dynasty.

===Christianity===

The following states recognize some form of Christianity as their state or official religion or recognize a special status for it (by denomination):

====Non-denominational Christianity====
* : In June 2017, Parliament voted to amend the wording of Article1 of the constitution, thereby making Christianity the state religion. Part 1, Section (1)(3) reads &quot;Samoa is a Christian nation founded on God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.&quot; The status of the religion had previously only been mentioned in the preamble, which Prime Minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi considered legally inadequate.
* : The preamble to the Zambian Constitution of 1991 declares Zambia to be &quot;a Christian nation&quot;, while also guaranteeing freedom of religion.

====Catholicism====
Jurisdictions where Catholicism has been established as a state or official religion:
* : Article 75 of the Constitution of Costa Rica confirms that &quot;The Catholic and Apostolic Religion is the religion of the State, which contributes to its maintenance, without preventing the free exercise in the Republic of other forms of worship that are not opposed to universal morality or good customs.&quot;
* : It is an elective, theocratic (or sacerdotal), absolute monarchy ruled by the Pope, who is also the Vicar of Christ. The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins. It is the sovereign territory of the Holy See () and the location of the Pope&#x27;s official residence, referred to as the Apostolic Palace.
* : The Constitution of Liechtenstein describes the Catholic Church as the state religion and enjoying &quot;the full protection of the State&quot;. The constitution does however ensure that people of other faiths &quot;shall be entitled to practice their creeds and to hold religious services to the extent consistent with morality and public order&quot;.
* : Article 2 of the Constitution of Malta declares that &quot;the religion of Malta is the Catholic and Apostolic Religion&quot;.
* : Article 9 of the Constitution of Monaco describes the &quot;Catholic, and apostolic religion&quot; as the religion of the state.

Jurisdictions that give various degrees of recognition in their constitutions to Roman Catholicism without establishing it as the State religion:
* : Article 2 of the Constitution of Argentina explicitly states that the government supports the Roman Catholic Apostolic Faith, but the constitution does not establish a state religion. Before its 1994 amendment, the Constitution stated that the President of the Republic must be a Roman Catholic.
* : Although Article 3 of the Constitution of El Salvador states that &quot;no restrictions shall be established that are based on differences of nationality, race, sex or religion&quot;, Article 26 states that the state recognizes the Catholic Church and gives it legal preference.
* : The Constitution of Guatemala recognises the juridical personality of the Catholic Church. Other churches, cults, entities, and associations of religious character will obtain the recognition of their juridical personality in accordance with the rules of their institution.
* : The Constitution of Italy does not establish a state religion, but recognizes the state and the Catholic Church as &quot;independent and sovereign, each within its own sphere&quot;. The Constitution additionally reserves to the Catholic faith singular position in regard to the organization of worship, as opposed to all other confessions.
* : The Constitution of Panama recognizes Catholicism as &quot;the religion of the majority&quot; of citizens but does not designate it as the official state religion.
* : The Constitution of Paraguay recognizes the Catholic Church&#x27;s role in the nation&#x27;s historical and cultural formation.
* : The Constitution of Peru recognizes the Catholic Church as an important element in the historical, cultural, and moral formation of Peru and lends it its cooperation.
* : The Constitution of Poland states that &quot;The relations between the Republic of Poland and the Roman Catholic Church shall be determined by international treaty concluded with the Holy See, and by statute.&quot;
* : The Constitution of Spain of 1978 abolished Catholicism as the official state religion, while recognizing the role it plays in Spanish society. The State allocates the 0.7% of the personal income tax corresponding to taxpayers who express their will to support the Catholic Church 
* : While the Constitution of Timor-Leste enshrines the principles of freedom of religion and separation of church and state in Section 45 Comma 1, it also acknowledges &quot;the participation of the Catholic Church in the process of national liberation&quot; in its preamble (although this has no legal value).

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
The jurisdictions below give various degrees of recognition in their constitutions to Eastern Orthodoxy, but without establishing it as the state religion:
* : The Church of Greece is recognized by the Greek Constitution as the prevailing religion in Greece. However, this provision does not give exclusivity of worship to the Church of Greece, while all other religions are recognized as equal and may be practiced freely.
* : In the Bulgarian Constitution, Eastern Orthodoxy is recognized as &quot;the traditional religion&quot; of the Bulgarian people, but the state itself remains secular.
* : The Constitution of Cyprus states: &quot;The Autocephalous Greek-Orthodox Church of Cyprus shall continue to have the exclusive right of regulating and administering its own internal affairs and property in accordance with the Holy Canons and its Charter in force for the time being and the Greek Communal Chamber shall not act inconsistently with such right.&quot;
* : Both the Finnish Orthodox Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland have judicial ties to the state.
* : The Georgian Orthodox Church has a constitutional agreement with the state, the constitution recognizing &quot;the special role of the Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Georgia in the history of Georgia and its independence from the state&quot;. (See also Concordat of 2002)

====Protestantism====
The following states recognize some form of Protestantism as their state or official religion:

====The Commonwealth====
=====Anglicanism=====
The Anglican Church of England is the established church in England as well as all three of the Crown Dependencies:
* : The Church of England is the established church in England, but not in the United Kingdom as a whole. It is the only established Anglican church worldwide. The Anglican Church in Wales, the Scottish Episcopal Church and the Church of Ireland are not established churches and they are independent of the Church of England. The British monarch is the titular Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The 26 most senior bishops in the Church of England are Lords Spiritual and have seats in the House of Lords of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
* : The Church of England is the established church in the Bailiwick of Guernsey, and the leader of the Church of England in the territory is the Dean of Guernsey.
* : The Church of England is the established church on the Isle of Man. The Bishop of Sodor and Man is an ex officio member of the Legislative Council (the upper house of Tynwald).
* : The Church of England is the established church in Jersey, and the leader of the church on the island is the Dean of Jersey, a non-voting member of the States of Jersey.

=====Calvinism=====
* : The Church of Scotland is the national church, but not of the United Kingdom as a whole. While it is the national church, it &#x27;is not State controlled&#x27; and the monarch is not the &#x27;supreme governor&#x27; as in the Church of England.
* : The Church of Tuvalu is the state religion, although in practice this merely entitles it to &quot;the privilege of performing special services on major national events&quot;. The Constitution of Tuvalu guarantees freedom of religion, including the freedom to practice, the freedom to change religion, the right not to receive religious instruction at school or to attend religious ceremonies at school, and the right not to &quot;take an oath or make an affirmation that is contrary to his religion or belief&quot;.

====Nordic countries====

=====Lutheranism=====
Jurisdictions where a Lutheran church has been fully or partially established as a state recognized religion include the Nordic States.
* : Section 4 of the Constitution of Denmark confirms the Church of Denmark as the established church.
** : The Church of the Faroe Islands is the state church of the Faroe Islands, an autonomous administrative division within the Danish Realm.
** : The Church of Denmark is the state church of Greenland, an autonomous administrative division within the Danish Realm.
* : The Constitution of Iceland confirms the Church of Iceland as the state church of Iceland.

Jurisdictions that give various degrees of recognition in their constitutions to Lutheranism without establishing it as the state religion:
* : The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland has a special relationship with the Finnish state, its internal structure being described in a special law, the Church Act. The Church Act can be amended only by a decision of the synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and subsequent ratification by the Parliament of Finland. The Church Act is protected by the Constitution of Finland and the state cannot change the Church Act without changing the constitution. The church has the power to tax its members. The state collects these taxes for the church, for a fee. On the other hand, the church is required to give a burial place for everyone in its graveyards. The President of Finland also decides the themes for intercession days. The church does not consider itself a state church, as the Finnish state does not have the power to influence its internal workings or its theology, although it has a veto in those changes of the internal structure which require changing the Church Act. Neither does the Finnish state accord any precedence to Lutherans or the Lutheran faith in its own acts.
* : Until 2012, the Church of Norway was not a separate legal entity from the government. It was disestablished and became a national church, a legally distinct entity from the state with special constitutional status. The King of Norway is required by the Constitution to be a member of the Church of Norway, and the church is regulated by special canon law, unlike other religions.
* : The Church of Sweden was the state church of Sweden between 1527 when King Gustav Vasa broke all ties with Rome and 2000 when the state officially became secular. Much like in Finland, it does have a special relation to the Swedish state unlike any other religious organizations. For example, there is a special law that regulates certain aspects of the church and the members of the royal family are required to belong to it in order to have a claim to the line of succession. A majority of the population still belongs to the Church of Sweden.

====Other/mixed====
* : The Armenian Orthodox Church has a constitutional agreement with the State: &quot;The Republic of Armenia shall recognise the exclusive mission of the Armenian Orthodox Holy Church, as a national church, in the spiritual life of the Armenian people, in the development of their national culture and preservation of their national identity.&quot;
* : The constitution of the Dominican Republic specifies that there is no state church and provides for freedom of religion and belief. A concordat with the Holy See designates Catholicism as the official religion and extends special privileges to the Catholic Church not granted to other religious groups. These include the legal recognition of church law, use of public funds to underwrite some church expenses, and complete exoneration from customs duties.
* : While Catholicism has not been the state religion since 1987, a 19th-century concordat with the Holy See continues to confer preferential treatment to the Catholic Church, in the form of stipends for clergy and financial support to churches and religious schools. The Catholic Church also retains the right to appoint certain amounts of clergy in Haiti without the government&#x27;s consent.
* : The preamble to the Hungarian Constitution of 2011 describes Hungary as &quot;part of Christian Europe&quot; and acknowledges &quot;the role of Christianity in preserving nationhood&quot;, while Article VII provides that &quot;the State shall cooperate with the Churches for community goals.&quot; However, the constitution also guarantees freedom of religion and separation of church and state.
* : The Nicaraguan Constitution of 1987 states that the country has no official religion, but defines &quot;Christian values&quot; as one of the &quot;principles of the Nicaraguan nation&quot;.
* : Although Church and State are formally separate, the Catholic Church in Portugal still receives certain privileges.

===Islam===
Many Muslim-majority countries have constitutionally established Islam, or a specific form of it, as a state religion. Proselytism (converting people away from Islam) is often illegal in such states.
* Afghanistan: Officially, Afghanistan has continuously been an Islamic state under various constitutions since at least 1987. Since 2021, the Taliban has made Sunni Islam according to the Hanafi school official, and has discriminated systematically against the Shia minority.
* Algeria: &quot;Islam shall be the religion of the State.&quot;
* : Article (2A) of the Constitution of Bangladesh declares: &quot;Islam is the state religion of the republic&quot;.
* Bahrain: &quot;The religion of the State is Islam.&quot;
* Brunei: Article 3 of the Constitution of Brunei: &quot;The official religion of Brunei Darussalam shall be the Islamic Religion...&quot;
* Djibouti: Article 1 of the Constitution of Djibouti: &quot;Islam is the Religion of the State.&quot;
* Egypt: Article 2 of the Egyptian Constitution of 2014: &quot;Islam is the religion of the State&quot;.
* Iran: Article 12 of the Constitution of Iran: &quot;The official religion of Iran is Islam and the Twelver Ja&#x27;farî school [in usul al-Dîn and fiqh], and this principle will remain eternally immutable.&quot; Islam has been Iran&#x27;s state religion since 1501 dating back to the Safavid dynasty and has continued ever since, excluding the period of breaks in the Pahlavi dynasty.
* Iraq: Article 2 of the Constitution of Iraq: &quot;Islam is the official religion of the State and is a foundation source of legislation...&quot;
* Jordan: Article 2 of the Constitution of Jordan: &quot;Islam is the religion of the State and Arabic is its official language.&quot;
* Kuwait: Article 2 of the Constitution of Kuwait: &quot;The religion of the State is Islam and Islamic Law shall be a main source of legislation.&quot;
* Libya: Article 1 of the Libyan interim Constitutional Declaration: &quot;Islam is the Religion of the State and the principal source of legislation is Islamic Jurisprudence (Shari&#x27;a).&quot;
* Malaysia: Article 3 of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia: &quot;Islam is the religion of the Federation; but other religions may be practised in peace and harmony in any part of the Federation.&quot;
* Maldives: Article 10 of the Maldives&#x27;s Constitution of 2008: &quot;The religion of the State of the Maldives is Islam. Islam shall be the one of the bases of all the laws of the Maldives.&quot;
* Mauritania: Article 5 of the Constitution of Mauritania: &quot;Islam is the religion of the people and of the State.&quot;
* Morocco: Article 3 of the Constitution of Morocco: &quot;Islam is the religion of the State, which guarantees to all the free exercise of beliefs [cultes].&quot;
* Oman: Article 2 of the Constitution of Oman: &quot;The religion of the State is Islam and Islamic Sharia is the basis for legislation.&quot;
* Pakistan: Article 2 of the Constitution of Pakistan: &quot;Islam shall be the State religion of Pakistan.&quot;
* Palestine: Article 4 of the Basic Law of the State of Palestine: &quot;Islam is the official religion in Palestine. Respect and sanctity of all other heavenly religions shall be maintained.&quot;
* Qatar: Article 1 of the Constitution of Qatar: &quot;Qatar is an independent sovereign Arab State. Its religion is Islam and Shari&#x27;a law shall be a main source of its legislations.&quot;
* Saudi Arabia: Article 1 of the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia: &quot;The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a sovereign Arab Islamic State. Its religion is Islam.&quot;
* : Article 2 of the Constitution of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic declares that Islam is the state religion and law origin.
* Somalia: Article 2 of the Provisional Constitution of the Federal Republic of Somalia: &quot;Islam is the religion of the State.&quot;
* Syria: Article 3 of the Constitution of the Syrian Arab Republic: The religion of the President of the Republic is Islam; Islamic jurisprudence shall be a major source of legislation.
* United Arab Emirates: Article 7 of the Constitution of the United Arab Emirates: &quot;Islam shall be the official religion of the Union.&quot;
* Yemen: Article 2 of the Constitution of Yemen: &quot;Islam is the religion of the state, and Arabic is its official language.&quot;

In some countries, Islam is not recognized as a state religion, but holds special status:

* Tajikistan: Although there is a separation of religion from politics, certain aspects of law also privilege Islam. One such law declares &quot;Islam to be a traditional religion of Tajikistan, with more rights and privileges given to Islamic organizations than to religious groups of non-Muslim origin&quot;.
* Tunisia: Article 5 of the Constitution declares that &quot;Tunisia is part of the Muslim world, and the state alone must work to achieve the goals of pure Islam in preserving honourable life of religious freedom&quot;. Islam has been given special privileges by the Constitution, though it is no longer the state religion.
* Turkmenistan: The Constitution claims to uphold a secular system in which religious and state institutions are separate. However, in Turkmenistan, the state actively privileges a form of traditional Islam. The culture, including Islam, is a key facet, contributes to the Turkmen national identity. The state encourages the conceptualization of &quot;Turkmen Islam&quot;.
* Uzbekistan: Since independence, Islam has taken on an altogether new role in the nation-building process in Uzbekistan. The government affords Islam in special status and declared it as a national heritage and a moral guideline.

===Judaism===

* : Since the Proclamation of Israeli independence in 1948, Judaism is defined in several of its laws as a &quot;Jewish and democratic state&quot; (&quot;medina yehudit ve-demokratit&quot;). However, the term &quot;Jewish&quot; is a polyseme that can describe the Jewish people as either an ethnic or a religious group. The debate about the meaning of the term &quot;Jewish&quot; and its legal and social applications is one of the most profound issues with which Israeli society deals. The problem of the status of religion in Israel, even though it is relevant to all religions, usually refers to the status of Judaism in Israeli society. Thus, even though from a constitutional point of view Judaism is not the state religion in Israel, its status nevertheless determines relations between religion and state and the extent to which religion influences the political center. The Law of Return, passed on 5 July 1950, gives the global Jewish diaspora the right to relocate to Israel and acquire Israeli citizenship. Section - (1) of that law declares that &quot;Every Jew has the right to come to this country as an &quot;Oleh&quot;&quot;(&#x27;immigrant&#x27;). In the Law of Return, the State of Israel gave effect to the Zionist movement&#x27;s &quot;credo&quot; which called for the establishment of Israel as a Sovereign Jewish state with Democratic setups, ideals and values. The State of Israel supports religious institutions, particularly Orthodox Jewish ones, and recognizes the &quot;religious communities&quot; as carried over from those recognized under the British Mandate—in turn derived from the pre-1917 Ottoman system of &quot;millets&quot;. These are Jewish and Christian (Eastern Orthodox, Latin Catholic, Gregorian-Armenian, Armenian-Catholic, Syriac Catholic, Chaldean, Melkite Catholic, Maronite Catholic, and Syriac Orthodox). The fact that the Muslim population was not defined as a religious community does not affect the rights of the Muslim community to practice their faith. At the end of the period covered by the 2009 U.S. International Religious Freedom Report, several of these denominations were pending official government recognition; however, the Government has allowed adherents of not officially recognized groups the freedom to practice. In 1961, legislation gave Muslim Shari&#x27;a courts exclusive jurisdiction in matters of personal status. Three additional religious communities have subsequently been recognized by Israeli law: the Druze (prior under Islamic jurisdiction), the Evangelical Episcopal Church, and followers of the Baháʼí Faith.

===Political religions===
In some countries, there is a political ideology sponsored by the government that may be called political religion.

===Multiple religion recognition===
* : The government of China officially espouses state atheism, and officially recognizes only five religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Christianity (Catholicism and Protestantism). Despite limitations on certain forms of religious expression and assembly, religion is not banned, and religious freedom is nominally protected under the Chinese constitution. Among the general Chinese population there is a wide variety of religious practices. The Chinese government&#x27;s attitude to religion is one of skepticism and non-promotion.
* : The local law in Alsace-Moselle accords official status to four religions in this specific region of France: Judaism, Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism and Calvinism. The law is a remnant of the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801, which was abrogated in the rest of France by the law of 1905 on the separation of church and state. However, at the time, Alsace-Moselle had been annexed by Germany. The Concordat, therefore, remained in force in these areas, and it was not abrogated when France regained control of the region in 1918. Therefore, the separation of church and state, part of the French concept of Laïcité, does not apply in this region.
* is officially a presidential republic and a unitary state that does not declare or designate a state religion. Officially, the government recognizes six religions: Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Confucianism, as well as traditional and indigenous beliefs. Pancasila comes from the Jakarta Charter whose first article was changed from &quot;Divinity, with the obligation to carry out Islamic law for its adherents&quot; to &quot;the One Divinity&quot;, to respect other religions. The Constitution of Indonesia guarantees freedom of religion and the practice of other religions and beliefs, including traditional animistic beliefs. Atheism, although not prosecuted, is discouraged by the state ideology of &quot;Pancasila&quot;. In addition, the province of Aceh receives a special status and a higher degree of autonomy, in which it may enact laws (&quot;qanuns&quot;) based on the Sharia and enforce it, especially to its Muslim residents.
* : There are 18 officially recognized religious groups in Lebanon, each with its own family law legislation and set of religious courts. Under the terms of an agreement known as the National Pact between the various political and religious leaders of Lebanon, the president of the country must be a Maronite, the Prime Minister must be a Sunni, the Speaker of Parliament must be a Shia, and the Deputy Prime Minister must be Greek Orthodox.
* is a secular state, but the Grand Duchy recognizes and supports several denominations, including the Catholic Church, Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Romanian Orthodox, Serbian Orthodox, Anglican and some Protestantism denominations as well as to Jewish congregations.
* is a secular nation, and secularism in Nepal under the interim constitution (Part 1, Article 4) is defined as &quot;religious and cultural freedom, along with the protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial&quot;. That is, &quot;the state government is bound for protecting and fostering Hindu religion&quot; while maintaining &quot;religious&quot; and &quot;cultural&quot; freedom throughout the nation as fundamental rights.
* : Though a secular state under the constitution, Russia is often said to have Russian Orthodoxy as the &quot;de facto&quot; national religion, despite other minorities: &quot;The Russian Orthodox Church is de facto privileged religion of the state, claiming the right to decide which other religions or denominations are to be granted the right of registration&quot;.

Islam in Russia is recognized under the law and by Russian political leaders as one of Russia&#x27;s traditional religions, Islam is a part of Russian historical heritage, and is subsidized by the Russian government. The position of Islam as a major Russian religion, alongside Orthodox Christianity, dates from the time of Catherine the Great, who sponsored Islamic clerics and scholarship through the Orenburg Assembly.

* is officially a secular country and does not have a state religion, and has been named in one study as the &quot;most religiously diverse nation in the world&quot;, with no religious group forming a majority. However, the government gives official recognition to ten different religions, namely Buddhism, Confucianism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Taoism, Sikhism, Shintoism, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Jainism, and the Baháʼí Faith, and Singapore&#x27;s penal code explicitly prohibits &quot;wounding religious feelings&quot;. The Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and Unification Church are also banned in Singapore, as the government deems them to be a threat to national security.
* is officially secular at the federal level but 24 of the 26 cantons support both the Swiss Reformed Church and the Roman Catholic Church in various ways.
* Turkey: The Republic of Turkey is officially a secular country. None of the past and the latest constitutions recognizes an official religion nor promotes any. But; the Directorate of Religious Affairs, an official state institution established by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in 1924, expresses opinions only on religious matters regarding Sunni institutions. The directorate regulates the operation of the country&#x27;s hundreds of thousands of registered mosques and employs local and provincial imams (who are civil servants) who are appointed and paid by the state, whilst other sects of Islam with a sizeable minority such as Alevism are not being regulated nor being funded by the directorate.

In addition, the Treaty of Lausanne explicitly guarantees the security and protection of both Greek and Armenian Orthodox Christian minorities and the Turkish-Jews. Their religious institutions are recognized officially by the state.

* is officially atheist (although sometimes also referred as atheist-Buddhist), but recognizes only 38 religious organizations and one &quot;dharma&quot; practice.

==Former state religions==
=== Roman religion and Christianity ===
Catholic Christianity, as opposed to Arianism and other ideologies deemed heretical, was declared to be the state religion of the Roman Empire on 27 February 380 by the decree &quot;De fide catolica&quot; of Emperor Theodosius I.

=== Han dynasty Confucianism ===
In China, the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) advocated Confucianism as the &quot;de facto&quot; state religion, establishing tests based on Confucian texts as an entrance requirement into government service—although, in fact, the &quot;Confucianism&quot; advocated by the Han emperors may be more properly termed a sort of Confucian Legalism or &quot;State Confucianism&quot;. This sort of Confucianism continued to be regarded by the emperors, with a few notable exceptions, as a form of state religion from this time until the collapse of the Chinese monarchy in 1912. Note, however, there is a debate over whether Confucianism (including Neo-Confucianism) is a religion or purely a philosophical system.

=== Yuan dynasty Buddhism ===
During the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty of China (1271–1368 CE), Tibetan Buddhism was established as the &quot;de facto&quot; state religion by the Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty. The top-level department and government agency known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) to supervise Buddhist monks throughout the empire. Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important. Before the end of the Yuan dynasty, 14 leaders of the Sakya sect had held the post of Imperial Preceptor (Dishi), thereby enjoying special power.

=== Golden Horde and Ilkhanate ===
The Mongol rulers Ghazan of Ilkhanate and Uzbeg of Golden Horde converted to Islam in 1295 CE because of the Muslim Mongol emir Nawruz and in 1313 CE because of Sufi Bukharan sayyid and sheikh Ibn Abdul Hamid respectively. Their official favoring of Islam as the state religion coincided with a marked attempt to bring the regime closer to the non-Mongol majority of the regions they ruled. In Ilkhanate, Christian and Jewish subjects lost their equal status with Muslims and again had to pay the poll tax; Buddhists had the starker choice of conversion or expulsion.

=== Former state churches in British North America ===
=== Other states ===
* The State of Deseret was an unrecognised provisional state of the United States, proposed in 1849, by Mormon settlers in Salt Lake City. The provisional state existed for slightly over two years, but attempts to gain recognition by the United States government floundered for various reasons. The Utah Territory which was then founded was under Mormon control, and repeated attempts to gain statehood met resistance, in part due to concerns that the principle of separation of church and state conflicted with the practice of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints placing their highest value on &quot;following counsel&quot; in virtually all matters relating to their church-centered lives. The state of Utah was eventually admitted to the union on 4January 1896, after the various issues had been resolved.
* : From 1862 to 1893 the Church of Hawaii, an Anglican body, was the official state and national church of the Kingdom of Hawaii.
* : see details in the State Shintō article.
* : Article 133 of the 1814 Constitution stipulated the Sovereign Prince should be a member of the Reformed Church; this provision was dropped in the 1815 Constitution. The 1815 Constitution also provided for a state salary and pension for the priesthood of established religions at the time (Protestantism, Catholicism and Judaism). This settlement, nicknamed &quot;de zilveren koorde&quot; (the silver cord), was abolished in 1983.
* was the world&#x27;s only Hindu state until 2015, when the new constitution declared it a secular state. Proselytizing remains illegal.
* : the Millet system (; ) was the independent court of law pertaining to &quot;personal law&quot; under which a confessional community (a group abiding by the laws of Muslim Sharia, Christian Canon law, or Jewish Halakha) was allowed to rule itself under its own laws.
* : Spain was traditionally a Catholic confessional state with the exception of the 1st and 2nd Republics, and currently is a non-confessional state.
* had Islam as the official religion during the rule of Omar al-Bashir according to the Constitution of Sudan of 2005. It was declared a secular state in September 2020.
* Tunisia: Article 5 of the Constitution declares that &quot;Tunisia is part of the Muslim world, and the state alone must work to achieve the goals of pure Islam in preserving honorable life of religious freedom&quot;. Although Islam has been given special privileges by the Constitution, it is no longer the state religion.
* sanctioned Buddhism and Confucianism as the state religions. Buddhism became an arm of the shogunate, and temples were used for population registration. Distinctive schools of Japanese Buddhism such as Zen, Pure Land, and Nichiren structured Japanese religious life until the 19th century. Confucian Zhu Xi&#x27;s teaching became a major intellectual force, and the Four Books became available to virtually every educated person.

==Established churches and former state churches==

<text>A plague pit is the informal term used to refer to mass graves in which victims of the Black Death were buried. The term is most often used to describe pits located in Great Britain, but can be applied to any place where bubonic plague victims were buried.

==Origin==
The plague which swept across China, Middle East, and Europe in the 14th century is estimated to have killed between one-third and two-thirds of Europe&#x27;s population. Disposal of the bodies of those who died presented huge problems for the authorities, and eventually the normal patterns of burial and funerary observance broke down.

==Major plague outbreaks==
Plague pits were used especially often during major plague outbreaks, such as the London epidemic of 1665. Graveyards rapidly filled and parishes became strained; for example the number of deaths in the parish of St Bride&#x27;s Church, Fleet Street, in 1665 was almost six times normal.

<doc id="292314" wikidata="Q849216" url="?curid=292314" title="Ex-gay movement">
<text>The ex-gay movement consists of people and organizations that encourage people to refrain from entering or pursuing same-sex relationships, to eliminate homosexual desires and to develop heterosexual desires, or to enter into a heterosexual relationship. Beginning with the founding of Love In Action and Exodus International in the mid-1970s, the movement saw rapid growth in the 1980s and 1990s before declining in the 2000s.

It relies on the involvement of individuals who formerly identified themselves as gay, lesbian, or bisexual but no longer do; these individuals may state either that they have eliminated their attraction to the same sex altogether or that they abstain from acting on such attraction.

After the collapse of Exodus International in 2013, a small number of ex-gay ministries continue as the Restored Hope Network. The movement&#x27;s ongoing impact on conservative religious discourse can be seen in an aversion to use of the term &quot;gay&quot; to refer to sexual orientation and its substitute with the language of &quot;same-sex attraction&quot;.

There have been various scandals related to this movement, including some self-claimed ex-gays having been found in same-sex relationships despite having denied this, as well as controversies over gay minors being forced to go to ex-gay camps against their will, and overt admissions by organizations related to the movement that conversion therapy does not work.

A large body of research and global scientific consensus indicates that being gay, lesbian, or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and social adjustment. Because of this, major mental health professional organizations discourage and caution individuals against attempting to change their sexual orientation to heterosexual, and warn that attempting to do so can be harmful.

== Characteristics ==
Various ex-gay organizations have working definitions of change. Prior to disbanding and renouncing the idea of a cure, Exodus International described change as, &quot;attaining abstinence from homosexual behaviors, lessening of homosexual temptations, strengthening their sense of masculine or feminine identity, correcting distorted styles of relating with members of the same and opposite gender&quot;. People Can Change defines change as, &quot;any degree of change toward greater peace, satisfaction and fulfillment, and less shame, depression and darkness&quot;, and emphasizes that for most people, heterosexuality is not the ultimate goal. When the term &quot;ex-gay&quot; was introduced to professional literature in 1980, E. Mansell Pattison defined it as describing a person who had &quot;experienced a basic change in sexual orientation&quot;. Some ex-gays advocate entering (or remaining) in a heterosexual marriage as part of the process. Some in mixed-orientation marriages acknowledge that their sexual attractions remain primarily homosexual, but seek to make their marriages work anyway.

Some people no longer identify as gay since they became Christians or with prayer, without going to conversion therapy.

== Objectives ==

Aside from achieving a degree of change in sexual orientation, the ex-gay movement pursues several broad goals and these include:

* coordination with individuals and organizations, particularly opponents of gay and lesbian civil equality to influence public perception and public policy;
* offering gays and lesbians a procedure that is claimed to solve many of their problems by making them heterosexual;
* promotion of ex-gay movement leaders as legitimate representatives in gay cultural/political discourse;
* the destigmatization of therapeutic attempts to change sexual orientation to undermine the American Psychological Association&#x27;s long-standing position that homosexuality is not a mental disorder.

==Motivation of participants==
The American Psychological Association reported that some ex-gay groups may help counteract and buffer minority stress, marginalization, and isolation in ways similar to other support groups, such as offering social support, fellowship, role models, and new ways to view a problem through unique philosophies or ideologies. Additionally, the same researchers also found that people joined ex-gay groups due to: a lack of other sources of social support; a desire for active coping, including both cognitive and emotional coping; and access to methods of sexual orientation identity exploration and reconstruction. The same report found that some have described the ex-gay groups as, &quot;a refuge for those who were excluded both from conservative churches and from their families, because of their same-sex sexual attractions, and from gay organizations and social networks, because of their conservative religious beliefs&quot;. According to the APA report, &quot;Ex-gay groups appear to relieve the distress caused by conflicts between religious values and sexual orientation and help participants change their sexual orientation identity, but not their sexual orientation&quot;. The APA goes on to report that some believed that by, &quot;taking on &#x27;ex-gay&#x27; cultural norms and language and finding a community that enabled and reinforced their primary religious beliefs, values, and concerns&quot;, they could resolve identity conflicts by:
*Adopting a new discourse or worldview.
*Engaging in a biographical reconstruction.
*Embracing a new explanatory model.
*Forming strong interpersonal ties.
One of the APA&#x27;s sources for the report found that, &quot;ex-gay groups recast homosexuality as an ordinary sin, and thus salvation was still achievable&quot;. Another one of their sources is summarized as having observed that, &quot;such groups built hope, recovery, and relapse into an ex-gay identity, thus expecting same-sex sexual behaviors and conceiving them as opportunities for repentance and forgiveness&quot;. The APA report warns, however, that &quot;some [ex-gay] groups may reinforce prejudice and stigma by providing inaccurate or stereotyped information about homosexuality&quot;.

==Ex-gay organizations==

The first contemporary ex-gay ministry, Love in Action, was formed in 1973. Three years later, with other ex-gay organizations, it formed Exodus International, the largest ex-gay organization and the largest organization under the Exodus Global Alliance. In May 1983, during a conference in the Netherlands, a European chapter was founded. In June 2013, the Exodus board decided to cease operations, with president Alan Chambers apologizing for the pain and hurt the group had caused and saying that he no longer believed sexual orientation could be changed. Chambers apologized for what he identified as regrettable techniques, and the narrow message of a cure and marriage rather than a relationship with Christ for all. Shortly after, Chambers and his wife started Speak.Love., an organisation for promoting conversations on sexual orientation for all. In September 2014, Speak.Love. was merged into Chambers&#x27; personal website. Exodus Global Alliance, however, no longer affiliated with Exodus International, has continued operations.

Other ex-gay organizations cater to specific religious groups, such as Courage International for Catholics, North Star for the LDS Church, JONAH for Jews, Joel 2:25 International for Catholic and Protestant Christians and OneByOne for Presbyterians.

Some groups follow a specific technique, such as Homosexuals Anonymous, modeled after the Alcoholics Anonymous twelve-step program. Other ex-gay organizations include Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays.

In the United States, the organization The Changed Movement hosts public &quot;Freedom March&quot; events where ex-gays discuss their changes.

== People ==
=== People associated with the ex-gay movement ===

*Joe Dallas is the program director of Genesis Counseling and the author of six books on human sexuality.
*Donnie McClurkin wrote about his experience with homosexuality in his book, &quot;Eternal Victim, Eternal Victor&quot;. He describes himself as going through a process by which he became &quot;saved and sanctified&quot;. McClurkin has been criticized for stating homosexuality is a curse. He speaks openly about sexual issues since becoming the biological father of a child with a woman to whom he was not married. He uses these experiences in his concerts and speaking engagements. In 2004, he sang at the Republican National Convention. The appearance generated criticism for the event organizers and McClurkin for his statements on homosexuality.
*Joseph Nicolosi was an American clinical psychologist, founder and director of the Thomas Aquinas Psychological Clinic in Encino, California, and a founder and former president of the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH).
*Jeffrey Satinover is an American psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, and physicist. He is a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of NARTH.
*Charles Socarides was an American psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, physician, educator, and author. He helped found NARTH in 1992.

=== People who no longer support the ex-gay movement ===

*John Paulk, then leader of Focus on the Family&#x27;s &quot;Love Won Out&quot; conference and chairman of the board for Exodus International North America, was spotted visiting a Washington, D.C. gay bar in September 2000. He was photographed outside of the bar from behind by Wayne Besen, and later stepped down from the two organizations. In 2013, he formally apologized for his involvement in promoting the ex-gay concept and for the harm his work had done.
*Peterson Toscano, because he adhered to Conservative Christian beliefs, spent seventeen years as part of the ex-gay movement attempting to alter his sexual orientation through conversion therapy and faith-based ex-gay programs. In addition to receiving pastoral counseling, conversion therapy, and discipleship training, he attended several ex-gay programs, including Life Ministries in New York City (1983–1991) and the residential ex-gay program Love in Action in Memphis, Tennessee (July 1996-October 1998). In April 2007, Toscano and Christine Bakke co-founded Beyond Ex-Gay, an organization that supports people who feel they have been wounded by such organizations.
*Anthony Venn-Brown is a former Australian evangelist in the Assemblies of God and an author whose book describes his experience in Australia&#x27;s first ex-gay program. Venn-Brown co-founded Freedom2b which offers support to LGBT people from church backgrounds and who have been displaced from the ex-gay movement. In 2007 he co-ordinated the release of a statement from five Australian ex-gay leaders who publicly apologized for their past actions.
*John Smid was the leader of Love In Action in Memphis. He resigned that position in 2008, and in 2010 apologized for any harm that he had caused, noting that his teen program &quot;further wounded teens that were already in a very delicate place in life&quot;. He has announced that he is still homosexual and admitted never seeing a man successfully converting to heterosexuality in his group.
*Warren Throckmorton is a past president of the American Mental Health Counselors Association. He wrote and produced the documentary &quot;I Do Exist&quot; about ex-gay people, but subsequently came to &quot;believe that categorical change in sexual attractions, especially for men, is rare&quot; and repudiated some of the claims he made in the film.

==Controversy==
=== Sexual orientation change efforts ===
Prior to disbanding, Exodus International recommended to their members that they undertake sexual orientation change efforts, such as conversion therapy. Exodus warned against going to counselors who tell a patient that they &quot;can definitely eliminate all attractions to your same gender, or that you can definitely acquire heteroerotic attractions&quot;. Evergreen International did not advocate any particular form of therapy, and warned that &quot;therapy will likely not be a cure in the sense of erasing all homosexual feelings&quot;.

Sexual orientation change efforts are controversial and the American Psychological Association reported that, &quot;the available evidence, from both early and recent studies, suggests that although sexual orientation is unlikely to change, some individuals modified their sexual orientation identity (i.e., individual or group membership and affiliation, self-labeling) and other aspects of sexuality (i.e. values and behavior)&quot;. Virtually all major mental health organizations have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public against treatments that purport to change sexual orientation.

In 2012, the Pan American Health Organization (the North and South American branch of the World Health Organization) released a statement cautioning against services that purport to &quot;cure&quot; people with non-heterosexual orientations as they lack medical justification and represent a serious threat to the health and well-being of affected people, and noted that the global scientific and professional consensus is that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of human sexuality and cannot be regarded as a pathological condition. The Pan American Health Organization further called on governments, academic institutions, professional associations and the media to expose these practices and to promote respect for diversity. The World Health Organization affiliate further noted that gay minors have sometimes been forced to attend these &quot;therapies&quot; involuntarily, being deprived of their liberty and sometimes kept in isolation for several months, and that these findings were reported by several United Nations bodies. Additionally, the Pan American Health Organization recommended that such malpractices be denounced and subject to sanctions and penalties under national legislation, as they constitute a violation of the ethical principles of health care and violate human rights that are protected by international and regional agreements.

In March 2018, the European parliament voted by 435 to 109 members of parliament to stop conversion therapies in memberstates of the European Union.

===Controversy over teenagers===
A controversial aspect of the ex-gay movement has been the focus of some ex-gay organizations on gay teenagers, including occasions where teenagers have been forced to attend ex-gay camps by their parents. A 2006 report by the National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce outlined evidence that ex-gay and conversion therapy groups were at the time increasingly focusing on children. Several legal researchers have responded to these events by arguing that parents who force their children into aggressive conversion therapy programs are committing child abuse under various state statutes.

One case of emancipation involved Lyn Duff. Duff was admitted to Rivendell Psychiatric Center in West Jordan, Utah on December 19, 1991, at age 15, after being involuntarily transported there at her mother&#x27;s behest. Duff was subjected to a regimen of conversion therapy, including aversion therapy, hypnosis, psychotropic drugs, solitary confinement, therapeutic messages linking lesbian sex with &quot;the pits of hell&quot;, behavior modification techniques, unreasonable forms of punishment for small infractions, and &quot;positive peer pressure&quot; group sessions in which patients demeaned and belittled each other for both real and perceived inadequacies. On May 19, 1992, after 168 days of incarceration, Duff escaped from Rivendell and traveled to San Francisco, where she lived on the streets and in safe houses. In 1992, Duff initiated legal action against the facility and her mother.

The ex-gay organization Love in Action was involved in a controversy surrounding a teenager. In July 2005, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a feature story about 16-year-old Zachary Stark, whose parents forced him to attend an ex-gay camp run by the group. In July 2005, Stark was released from the camp. An investigation of the camp by the Tennessee Department of Children&#x27;s Services did not uncover signs of child abuse. In September 2005, Tennessee authorities discovered that unlicensed staff had been administering prescription drugs. A settlement was reached shortly thereafter. LIA closed the camp in 2007.

<text>Luigia &quot;Gina&quot; Lollobrigida (4 July 1927 – 16 January 2023) was an Italian actress, model, photojournalist, and sculptor. She was one of the highest-profile European actresses of the 1950s and 1960s, a period in which she was an international sex symbol. Dubbed &quot;the most beautiful woman in the world&quot;, at the time of her death she was among the last surviving high-profile international actors from the Golden Age of Hollywood cinema.

As her film career slowed, Lollobrigida established a second career as a photojournalist. In the 1970s she achieved a scoop by gaining access to Fidel Castro for an exclusive interview.

Lollobrigida continued as an active supporter of Italian and Italian-American causes, particularly the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF). In 2008 she received the NIAF Lifetime Achievement Award at the Foundation&#x27;s Anniversary Gala. In 2013, she sold her jewellery collection and donated the nearly US$5 million from the sale to benefit stem-cell therapy research. She won the Henrietta Award at the 18th Golden Globe Awards.

==Youth==
Luigia Lollobrigida was born in Subiaco, Lazio, about from Rome, the daughter of a furniture maker and his wife. She had three sisters: Giuliana, Maria and Fernanda. After the end of World War II in 1945, the family moved to Rome, where Lollobrigida took singing lessons, did some modelling, and participated in several beauty contests, placing third in the 1947 Miss Italy contest. In 1946, she began appearing in Italian films in minor roles.

In 1945 at age 18, Lollobrigida played a part in the comedy &quot;Santarellina&quot; by Eduardo Scarpetta at the Teatro della Concordia of Monte Castello di Vibio, the smallest theatre &quot;all&#x27;italiana&quot; in the world.

==Acting career==

===Film===

In 1950, Howard Hughes signed Lollobrigida on a preliminary seven-year contract to make three pictures a year. She refused the final terms of the contract, preferring to remain in Europe, and Hughes suspended her. Despite selling RKO Pictures in 1955, Hughes retained Lollobrigida&#x27;s contract. The dispute prevented her from working in American movies filmed in the U.S. until 1959, but allowed for American productions shot in Europe, although Hughes often threatened legal action against the producers.

Her performance in the Italian romantic comedy &quot;Bread, Love and Dreams&quot; (&quot;Pane, amore e fantasia&quot;, 1953) led to its becoming a box-office success and her receiving a BAFTA nomination. Furthermore, she won a Nastro d&#x27;Argento award from the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists for her role in the picture. Lollobrigida appeared in &quot;The Wayward Wife&quot; (1953) and in &quot;Woman of Rome&quot; (1954). These were three of her most renowned Italian films, but she worked also in the French industry on such films as &quot;Fearless Little Soldier&quot; (&quot;Fanfan la Tulipe&quot;, 1952), &quot;Beauties of the Night&quot; (&quot;Les Belles de nuit&quot;, 1952), and &quot;Le Grand Jeu&quot; (1954).

Her first widely seen English-language film, &quot;Beat the Devil&quot; (1953), was shot in Italy, and directed by John Huston. In this film she played the wife of Humphrey Bogart, with Jennifer Jones and Robert Morley as her costars. She then took part in the Italian-American production &quot;Crossed Swords&quot; (1954), co-starring with Errol Flynn. Her performance in &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Woman&quot; (also known as &quot;Beautiful But Dangerous&quot;, 1955) led to her receiving the first David di Donatello for Best Actress award. In this movie Lollobrigida played Italian soprano Lina Cavalieri and sang all the songs in the movie, including arias from &quot;Tosca&quot;, in her own voice. She played the principal female lead in the circus drama &quot;Trapeze&quot; (1956) directed by Carol Reed and co-starring with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis and in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1956) appeared as Esmeralda with Anthony Quinn as Quasimodo. The film was directed by Jean Delannoy.

She appeared in the French movie &quot;The Law&quot; (1959), alongside Yves Montand and Marcello Mastroianni; then, she co-starred with Frank Sinatra in &quot;Never So Few&quot; (1959) and with Yul Brynner in &quot;Solomon and Sheba&quot; (1959). The latter was the last film directed by King Vidor and features a dance routine which was supposed to depict an orgy scene. Brynner had been chosen to substitute for Tyrone Power, who died before the shots were completed.

In the romantic comedy &quot;Come September&quot; (1961), Lollobrigida had a leading role along with Rock Hudson, Sandra Dee, and Bobby Darin. It was a film for which she won a Golden Globe Award. She appeared, also in 1961, with Ernest Borgnine and Anthony Franciosa in the drama &quot;Go Naked in the World&quot;.
She attended the 1961 Academy Awards ceremony, hosted by Bob Hope, delivering the Academy Award for Best Director to Billy Wilder for the film The Apartment.

Jean Delannoy then directed her again, this time in &quot;Venere Imperiale&quot; (1962). She co-starred with Stephen Boyd and received Nastro d&#x27;Argento and David di Donatello awards. She co-starred with Sean Connery in the thriller &quot;Woman of Straw&quot; (1964), with Rock Hudson again in &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot; (1965), and appeared with Alec Guinness in &quot;Hotel Paradiso&quot; (1966).

Lollobrigida starred in &quot;Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell&quot; (1968) with Shelley Winters, Phil Silvers, Peter Lawford, and Telly Savalas. For this role, she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and won a third David di Donatello award. Lollobrigida co-starred with Bob Hope in the comedy &quot;The Private Navy of Sgt. O&#x27;Farrell&quot; (1968) and also accompanied Hope on his visits to military troops overseas.
During this stage of her career, she rejected roles in many films, including &quot;Lady L&quot; (1965) with Tony Curtis, directed by George Cukor, due to conflicts with Cukor (the leading role then went to Sophia Loren); &quot;Five Branded Women&quot; (1960), directed by Martin Ritt (the leading role went to Silvana Mangano); and &quot;The Lady Without Camelias&quot; (1953), directed by Michelangelo Antonioni (the leading role went to Lucia Bosè). She later revealed regret for having refused a supporting role in &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960). The film&#x27;s director, Federico Fellini, wanted to cast her in the film but, she explained, proposed projects were arriving too often at the time and her husband accidentally misplaced the script.

By the 1970s, her film career had slowed down. She appeared in &quot;King, Queen, Knave&quot; (1972), co-starring with David Niven, and in a few other poorly received productions in the early part of the decade. In 1973, she was a member of the jury at the 8th Moscow International Film Festival.

===Television===

In the mid-1980s, she guest starred in a multi-episode arc on the television series &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; as Francesca Gioberti, a role originally written for Sophia Loren, who had turned it down. For the role, she received a third Golden Globe nomination. She also had a supporting role in the 1985 television miniseries &quot;Deceptions&quot;, co-starring with Stefanie Powers. The following year, she appeared as a guest star in the TV series &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

==Judging==
In 1986, she was invited to head the jury at the 36th Berlin International Film Festival, which awarded the Golden Bear to Reinhard Hauff&#x27;s film &quot;Stammheim&quot;. She said the majority decision was &quot;prefabricated&quot;, and opposed it. In 1997 she was in the jury at Film Fest Gent and similarly distanced herself from the Grand Prix winner The Witman Boys, which she deemed &#x27;immoral&#x27;.

==Photojournalism==
By the end of the 1970s, Lollobrigida had embarked on what she developed into a successful second career as a photographic journalist. She photographed, among others, Paul Newman, Salvador Dalí, Henry Kissinger, David Cassidy, Audrey Hepburn, Ella Fitzgerald, and the Germany national football team. In 1974 she managed to obtain an exclusive interview with Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Between 1972 and 1994 she published six collections of her photographs, including the 1973 title &quot;Italia Mia&quot;.

==Politics==

In 1999, Lollobrigida unsuccessfully ran for election to the European Parliament as a candidate for The Democrats, a party led by Romano Prodi. In 2020, she publicly endorsed Pope Francis&#x27; view on LGBT rights. In the 2022 Italian general election, Lollobrigida, at the age of 95, attempted to win a seat in the Senate of the Republic, by standing for election as candidate for the Sovereign and Popular Italy (ISP), a newly founded Eurosceptic alliance opposed to Mario Draghi, in Latina, Lazio. She was unsuccessful, as the party garnered only 1% of the constituency vote, below the 3% electoral threshold. In an interview with &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; prior to the election, Lollobrigida said she was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s &quot;way of doing things&quot;. She also claimed to have been close to Indira Gandhi.

==Personal life==

In 1949 Lollobrigida married a Slovenian physician, Milko Škofič. Their only child, Andrea Milko (Milko Škofič Jr.), was born on 28 July 1957. Škofič gave up the practice of medicine to become her manager. In 1960, Lollobrigida moved from her native Italy to Toronto, with Škofič and their son. The couple meant to solve the legal situation of their son who was considered stateless by the Italian bureaucracy. The couple divorced in 1971.

In October 2006, at age 79, she announced to Spain&#x27;s &quot;¡Hola!&quot; magazine her engagement to a 45-year-old Spanish businessman, Javier Rigau y Rafols ().

They had met at a party in Monte Carlo in 1984 and had since become companions. The engagement was called off on 6 December 2006, reportedly because of the strain of intense media interest.

In 2006 Lollobrigida and Rigau signed a prenuptial agreement and married in Spain.

In January 2013, she started legal action against Rigau, claiming that her ex-boyfriend had staged a secret ceremony in which he &quot;married&quot; an imposter pretending to be her at a registry office in Barcelona. She said he intended to lay claim to her estate after her death. Lollobrigida accused Rigau of fraud, saying that he had earlier obtained the legal right to act on her behalf with a power of attorney, and carried out the plot to get extra power. &quot;A while ago he convinced me to give him my power of attorney. He needed it for some legal affairs. But instead, I fear that he took advantage of the fact that I don&#x27;t understand Spanish ... Who knows what he had me sign.&quot; In March 2017, she lost her court action, but subsequently said that she would appeal.

Lollobrigida had a habit of referring to herself in the third person.

Lollobrigida retired from filming in 1997. She told &quot;PARADE&quot; in April 2000: &quot;I studied painting and sculpting at school and became an actress by mistake ... I&#x27;ve had many lovers and still have romances. I am very spoiled. All my life, I&#x27;ve had too many admirers.&quot; After retirement she divided her time between her house on Via Appia Antica in Rome and a villa in Monte Carlo. After 2009, she refused visitors to her home.

In 2013, Lollobrigida sold her jewelry collection through Sotheby&#x27;s. She donated nearly $5 million to benefit stem-cell therapy.

In 2019, the Roman Rota, with the consent of Pope Francis, issued a declaration of nullity for her marriage with Rigau after a two-year review.

At the end of the 2010s, Andrea Piazzolla became Lollobrigida&#x27;s main collaborator, general director and trustee of some Monegasque real estate and financial societies. In July 2020 he was charged for circumvention of an incapable person.

In 2021, the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation, at the request of her son, ruled that Lollobrigida should have a legal guardian appointed to manage her affairs and prevent predation. Although the court determined she was mentally capable, medical evidence had indicated that there was &quot;a weakening in her correct perception of reality&quot; and that she was in a state of &quot;vulnerability&quot;.

Lollobrigida died at a clinic in Rome on 16 January 2023, at the age of 95. She is buried in her birthplace, Subiaco, Lazio.

The lawyer and politician, and current Minister of Agriculture of Italy, Francesco Lollobrigida, is her great-nephew.

In 2022, sports media noted that Olympic speed skating silver medalist Francesca Lollobrigida is her great-niece, though the two had never met.

In November 2023, Andrea Piazzolla was convicted of embezzling Lollobrigida&#x27;s millions.

==Awards and nominations==
Lollobrigida won three David di Donatello, two Nastro d&#x27;Argento, and six Bambi awards. She was nominated three times for the Golden Globe and won once in 1961 as &quot;World Film Favorite&quot;– &quot;Female&quot;. She was nominated once for a BAFTA award.

In 1985, she was nominated as an officer of France&#x27;s &quot;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; by Jack Lang, for her achievements in photography and sculpture.

Lollobrigida was awarded the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; by François Mitterrand.

On 16 October 1999, Lollobrigida was nominated as a Goodwill Ambassador of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.

On 1 February 2018, Lollobrigida received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

<text>The green-veined white (&quot;Pieris napi&quot;) is a butterfly of the family Pieridae.

==Appearance and distribution==
A circumboreal species widespread across Europe and Asia, including the Indian subcontinent, Japan, the Maghreb and North America. It is found in meadows, hedgerows and woodland glades but not as often in gardens and parks like its close relatives the large and small whites, for which it is often mistaken. Like other &quot;white&quot; butterflies, the sexes differ. The female has two spots on each forewing, the male only one. The veins on the wings of the female are usually more heavily marked. The underside hindwings are pale yellow with the veins highlighted by black scales giving a greenish tint, hence green-veined white. Unlike the large and small whites, it rarely chooses garden cabbages to lay its eggs on, preferring wild crucifers. Males emit a sex pheromone that is perceptible to humans, citral, the basic flavor-imparting component of lemon peel oil.

Some authors consider the mustard white and West Virginia white of North America to be conspecific with &quot;P. napi&quot; or consider &quot;P. napi&quot; to be a superspecies. Despite this, the American butterflies, unlike &quot;P. napi&quot;, cannot successfully use garlic mustard as a host plant. Females will lay eggs on it, mistaking this non-native species for a compatible native mustard, resulting in the death of the offspring. Classification is also an issue concerning the European dark-veined white.
==Life cycle and food plants==
The eggs are laid singly on a wide range of food plants including hedge mustard (&quot;Sisymbrium officinale&quot;), garlic mustard (&quot;Alliaria petiolata&quot;), cuckooflower (&quot;Cardamine pratense&quot;), water-cress (&quot;Rorippa nastutium-aquaticum&quot;), charlock (&quot;Sinapis arvensis&quot;), large bitter-cress (&quot;Cardamine amara&quot;), wild cabbage (&quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;), and wild radish (&quot;Raphanus raphanistrum&quot;), and so it is rarely a pest in gardens or field crops. The caterpillar is green and well camouflaged. When full grown it is green above with black warts, from which arise whitish and blackish hairs. There is a darker line along the back and a yellow line low down on the sides. Underneath the colour is whitish-grey. The spiracular line is dusky but not conspicuous, and the spiracles are blackish surrounded with yellow. There is extensive overlap with other leaf-feeding larvae of large and small whites in some wild populations (e.g. in Morocco). It is often found feeding on the same plant as the orange tip but rarely competes for food because it usually feeds on the leaves whereas the orange tip caterpillar feeds on the flowers and developing seed pods. Like other &quot;Pieris&quot; species it overwinters as a pupa. This is green in colour, and the raised parts are yellowish and brown. This is the most frequent form, but it varies through yellowish to buff or greyish, and is sometimes without markings.

==Habitat==
&quot;P. napi&quot; is found in damp, grassy places with some shade, forest edges, hedgerows, meadows and wooded river valleys. The later generations widen their habitat use in the search for alternative food plants in drier, but flowery places. In the Mediterranean the insect is also found in scrub around mountain streams or springs and on floodplains with &quot;Nasturtium officinale&quot;. It is found from sea level to high elevations (2500 m in central Europe, 2600 m in Italy, 3600 m in Morocco).

==Flight times==
The generations vary with location, elevation and season. In northern Europe there are two or three generations from April to early September. In warmer areas and in some good years there is a fourth generation. In southern Europe there are three or more partially overlapping generations from March to October.

==Seasonal variation==

In Great Britain, April, May and June specimens have the veins tinged with grey and rather distinct, but are not so strongly marked with black as those belonging to the second flight, which occurs in late July and throughout August. This seasonal variation, as it is called, is also most clearly exhibited on the underside. In the May and June butterfly (plate 13, left side) the veins below are greenish grey, and those of the hindwings are broadly bordered also with this colour. In the bulk of the July and August specimens (plate 13, right side) only the nervures are shaded with greenish grey, and the nervures are only faintly, or not at all, marked with this colour. Now and then a specimen of the first brood may assume the characters properly belonging to the specimens of the second brood; and, on the other hand, a butterfly of the second brood may closely resemble one of the first brood. As a rule, however, the seasonal differences referred to are fairly constant. By rearing this species from the egg it has been ascertained that part (sometimes the smaller) of a brood from eggs laid in June attains the butterfly stage the same year, and the other part remains in the chrysalis until the following spring, the butterflies in each set being of the form proper to the time of emergence.

==Other variation==
In the typical form -&quot;forma typica&quot;- the forewings are creamy-white, irrorated with black towards the base. There is an apical blackish blotch, sometimes broken into several terminal spots; and a black spot between 3 and 4 (in male sometimes absent) In the female there is a black subdorsal posterior spot, and a dorsal confluent mark. The hindwings are creamy-white, the base black-sprinkled and a black costal spot before the apex (in male sometimes
absent). The underside of the hindwings and underside apex of the forewings is pale yellow the veins edged with a shading of fine black lines, in the hindwings more broadly.

The ground colour varies from white to cream, sulphur-yellow, chrome yellow and light hues of buff or brown. The spot markings also vary and may be joined or absent. The vein shading varies in colour and in intensity and the shaded bands may be broad or narrow.

Variants, many named, are described by Röber (Europe), Langham (Ireland) and Anon (Britain)


==Behaviour==

===Senses===
Recent research has shown that when males mate with a female, they inject methyl salicylate along with their sperm. The smell of this compound repels other males, thus ensuring the first male&#x27;s paternity of the eggs—a form of chemical mate guarding.

After a female mates, she will display a mate refusal posture that releases methyl salicylate during a subsequent courtship. The release of this anti-aphrodisiac will quickly terminate the courtship. Males are very sensitive to differences in methyl salicylate levels, and will use this sense to influence their mating behaviour. However, a virgin female displaying a very similar posture will release a different chemical that will prolong the courtship ritual. Males are sensitive to these chemical and postural differences, and can discriminate between a receptive virgin female and an unreceptive mated female.

The adult male of this species has a distinctive odour that resembles lemon verbena. This smell is associated with specialized androconial scales on male wings.

===Mating system===

In the usually polyandrous &quot;P. napi&quot;, females who mate multiple times have higher lifetime fecundity, lay larger eggs, and live longer compared to females who mate only once. In most organisms it is the female who contributes the most to the reproduction of offspring as she must invest an egg and then carry the zygote. Males, on the other hand, need only provide a sperm that is of low cost. In &quot;P. napi,&quot; however, mating is unusually costly to males as the ejaculate matter produced contains not only sperm but accessory substances as well. These substances average 15% of male body mass and are incorporated into female soma and reproductive tissues during the mating process. Therefore, the nuptial gift given by &quot;P. napi&quot; males qualifies both as paternal investment and mating effort. Despite the presence of nuptial gifts and the known benefits to females and offspring, some females are still monogamous. There are multiple reasons in why other species are monogamous like access to males, low sperm population, and age. Some &quot;P. napi&quot; are likely monogamous due to variation in egg production between polygamous and monogamous females. Polygamous females rely on male mates in order to increase their reproductive output, but polygamous females that only mate twice may not have as high of reproductive output as monogamous females do. This system is unlike other types of butterflies such as &quot;Pararge aegeria&quot;, where female reproductive effort is independent of male ejaculate.

The amount of ejaculate of virgin males during mating is larger than that of non-virgin males. Females therefore must mate more frequently with non-virgin males in order to obtain the necessary amount of male-derived nutrition.

===Sexual cooperation and conflict===

In &quot;P. napi&quot;, the nuptial gift is an example of sexual cooperation towards a common interest of both males and females. The existence of nutrients in the ejaculate is beneficial to the females because it increases female fecundity and longevity, and eventually promotes re-mating. The existence of the anti-aphrodisiac, methyl salicylate, is effective in reducing female harassment by other males.

However, the transfer of this ejaculate can cause a conflict over re-mating due to sperm competition. After a female mates, infertile sperm ejaculated by the male will fill the female&#x27;s sperm storage organ and prevent her from mating. The amount of infertile sperm stored is correlated with the refractory period of a female after mating. Infertile sperm makes up 90% of the sperm count, showing that males manipulate females by preventing them from mating with another male for a certain period of time. Although polyandry benefits females of &quot;P. napi&quot; by maximizing the amount of transferred nutrients from the male, the infertile sperm storage prolongs female re-mating.

This refractory period makes it harder for females to mate, and females will continue to have difficulty as their age and mating frequency increase. Males who have recently copulated will not transfer as many nutrients to their next mate, but will spend a longer duration of time for each mating. This increases the mating costs for females because they are spending more time copulating and receiving fewer nutrients from the ejaculate. Males take advantage of this because females do not reduce their mating costs by copulating with virgin males. In addition, males will transfer the most methyl salicylate to their first mate to ensure its paternity. However, a female who mates with a virgin male will have the most difficulty re-mating, therefore delaying her from engaging in the preferred polyandry. Males tailor their ejaculate in the sense that the first ejaculate is meant to prolong the refractory period of the female, and every subsequent ejaculate is meant to maximize efficiency in sperm competition.

=== Monandry and polyandry ===

==== Fecundity benefits of polyandry ====
Fecundity in &quot;P. napi&quot; varies with the number of eggs produced as well as the lifespan of the female, and is positively influenced by body mass, other genetic factors independent of body size, and with the degree of polyandry. Fecundity increases with the amount of spermatophore material and ejaculate received from males during mating. In particular, mating with recently unmated males can increase overall female reproductive output, though small females are unable to compensate for the negative effects of size on fecundity by mating multiply. However, by mating multiply, polyandrous females have overall higher lifetime fecundity, produce more offspring, and have faster-developing offspring compared to monandrous females.

==== Polyandry versus monandry is a genetically based mating strategy ====
Despite the benefits of mating multiply, many female &quot;P. napi&quot; only mate once, irrespective of the number of high quality, more fit, mates available. Monandry is more common in northern populations of &quot;P. napi&quot;, and sperm competition is correspondingly lower in the north. This polymorphic mating system is partially determined by genetic variability within the females genomes. Monandrous and polyandrous females exhibit different heritable reproductive tactics with monandrous females relying on larval derived resources to realize their fecundity and polyandrous females relying on male donations. When genetically polyandrous females are forced into monandry, due to suboptimal mating conditions, they experience reduced life spans. Monandrous and polyandrous females exhibit different life history strategies: at the start of reproduction females that are monandrous produce more eggs than polyandrous females. It is hypothesized that this life history difference is why monandry is more common in the most northern parts of the species&#x27; range, as early investment in reproduction can be more beneficial with shorter mating seasons.

==== Maintenance of the monandry/polyandry genetic polymorphism ====
The maintenance of the two mating systems had been hypothesized to be due to the availability of male nutrients, which can vary within the male-biased operational sex ratio. The male biased sex-ratio can lead to strong competition for mates among the males as well as the males are unlikely to encounter more than one female during the mating season. As a result, females often encounter males that have not recently mated that provide large nuptial gifts. Given the size of the nuptial gift provided by males, means that polyandrous females can substantially increase their lifetime fecundity. However, higher mating rates in females comes with a cost, which can explain the presence of monandrous females in primarily polyandrous populations. Polyandrous females have a higher cost of mating characterized by an increase in time spent looking for mates and time spent mating. This results in a decreased time spent looking for food.

==Taxonomy==
Some authorities consider &quot;P. napi&quot; to be a superspecies that includes the American species mustard white and West Virginia white as well as the European dark-veined white.

However, the American butterflies cannot successfully reproduce by laying eggs on the invasive weed garlic mustard, &quot;Alliaria petiolata&quot;, a fact that threatens their survival as garlic mustard out-competes native mustard plants due to having no biological control species present in North America. In Europe, where garlic mustard is native, 76 things consume it.

<text>The Pieridae are a large family of butterflies with about 76 genera containing about 1,100 species, mostly from tropical Africa and tropical Asia with some varieties in the more northern regions of North America and Eurasia. Most pierid butterflies are white, yellow, or orange in coloration, often with black spots. The pigments that give the distinct coloring to these butterflies are derived from waste products in the body and are a characteristic of this family. The family was created by William Swainson in 1820.

The name &quot;butterfly&quot; is believed to have originated from a member of this family, the brimstone, &quot;Gonepteryx rhamni&quot;, which was called the &quot;butter-coloured fly&quot; by early British naturalists.

The sexes usually differ, often in the pattern or number of the black markings.

The larvae (caterpillars) of a few of these species, such as &quot;Pieris brassicae&quot; and &quot;Pieris rapae&quot;, commonly seen in gardens, feed on brassicas, and are notorious agricultural pests.

Males of many species exhibit gregarious mud-puddling behavior when they may imbibe salts from moist soils.

== Morphology ==

The Pieridae have the radial vein on the forewing with three or four branches and rarely with five branches. The forelegs are well developed in both sexes, unlike in the Nymphalidae, and the tarsal claws are , unlike in the Papilionidae.

Like the Papilionidae, the Pieridae also have their pupae held at an angle by a silk girdle, but running at the first abdominal segment, unlike the thoracic girdle seen in the Papilionidae. But some species such as the madrone butterfly that belong to this family do not shows the presence of this abdominal silk girdle.

== Subfamilies ==

The Pieridae are generally divided into these four subfamilies:

* Dismorphiinae (six genera), mostly Neotropical; this group includes several mimetic species. The host plants are in the family Fabaceae.
* Pierinae (55 genera), whites, yellows, and orange-tips; many of these species are strongly migratory. Host plants are in the families Capparidaceae, Brassicaceae, Santalaceae, and Loranthaceae.
* Coliadinae (14 genera), sulphurs or yellows; many of these species are sexually dimorphic. Some, such as &quot;Colias&quot;, have wing patterns that are visible only under ultraviolet.
* Pseudopontiinae includes only the genus &quot;Pseudopontia&quot;, which was formerly considered monotypic. Its type species—formerly the sole species in this subfamily—&quot;Pseudopontia paradoxa&quot;, is endemic to West Africa.

According to the molecular phylogenetic study of Braby et al. (2005), sister group relationships among Pieridae subfamilies are ((Dismorphiinae + Pseudopontiinae) + (Coliadinae + Pierinae)).

== Some common species ==
* Brimstone, &quot;Gonepteryx rhamni&quot;
* California dogface, &quot;Zerene eurydice&quot;
* Catalina orangetip, &quot;Anthocharis cethura catalina&quot;
* Cloudless sulphur, &quot;Phoebis sennae&quot;
* Clouded yellow, &quot;Colias croceus&quot;
* Orange tip, &quot;Anthocharis cardamines&quot;
* Psyche butterfly, &quot;Leptosia nina&quot;
== Some pest species ==

* &quot;Colias eurytheme&quot;, alfalfa butterfly or orange sulphur

* &quot;Colias philodice&quot; clouded sulphur
* &quot;Pieris rapae&quot;, small white or cabbage white
* &quot;Pieris brassicae&quot;, large white or cabbage white

<text>Nils Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld (; 18 November 183212 August 1901) was a Finland-Swedish aristocrat, geologist, mineralogist and Arctic explorer. He was a member of the noble Nordenskiöld family of scientists and held the title of a friherre (baron).

Born in the Grand Duchy of Finland in the Russian Empire, he was forced to move to Sweden in 1857 due to his political activity, where he became a member of the Parliament of Sweden and of the Swedish Academy. He led the &quot;Vega&quot; Expedition along the northern coast of Eurasia in 1878–1879. This was the first complete crossing of the Northeast Passage. Initially a troubled enterprise, the successful expedition is considered to be among the highest achievements in the history of Swedish science.

==Nordenskiöld family==
The Nordenskiölds were an old Fenno-Swedish family, and members of the nobility. Nordenskiöld&#x27;s father, Nils Gustaf Nordenskiöld, was a Finnish mineralogist, civil servant and traveller. He was also a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Adolf Erik was the father of Gustaf Nordenskiöld (explorer of Mesa Verde) and Erland Nordenskiöld (ethnographer of South America) and maternal uncle of Nils Otto Gustaf Nordenskjöld (another polar explorer). Nils Otto Gustaf Nordenskjöld&#x27;s parents were cousins — Otto Gustaf Nordenskjöld (born in 1831 in Hässleby, Sweden) and Anna Elisabet Sofia Nordenskiöld (born in 1841 in Finland), who was the sister of Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld. The Swedish side of the family used the spelling &quot;Nordenskjöld&quot;, whereas the Finnish side of the family used the &quot;Nordenskiöld&quot; spelling.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Nordenskiöld was born in 1832 in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, but he spent his early youth on the family estate, the Alikartano Manor (&quot;Frugård&quot;), located in the Numminen village in Mäntsälä. He went to school in Porvoo, a small town on the south coast of Finland. He then entered the Imperial Alexander University in Helsinki in 1849 where he studied mathematics, geology, and applied himself especially to chemistry and mineralogy. He received his master&#x27;s degree in 1853. Two years later he published his doctoral dissertation, entitled &quot;Om grafitens och chondroditens kristallformer&quot; (&quot;On the crystal forms of graphite and chondrodite&quot;).

Upon his graduation, in 1853, Nordenskiöld accompanied his father to the Ural Mountains and studied the iron and copper mines at Tagilsk; on his return he received minor appointments both at the university and the mining office.

=== Political activity and exile ===
Having studied under Johan Ludvig Runeberg, Nordenskiöld belonged to Liberal, anti-tsarist circles that agitated for Finland&#x27;s liberation from Russia by the Swedes during the Crimean War. An unguarded speech at a convivial entertainment in 1855 drew the attention of the Imperial Russian authorities to his political views, and led to a dismissal from the university.

He then visited Berlin, continuing his mineralogical studies, and in 1856 obtained a travelling stipend from the university in Helsinki and planned to expend it in geological research in Siberia and Kamchatka. In 1856, Nordenskiöld was also appointed Docent in Mineralogy at the university. In 1857 he aroused the suspicion of the authorities again, so that he was forced to leave Finland, practically as a political refugee, and was deprived of the right of ever holding office in the university of Finland. He fled to Sweden.

In 1862, he was one of the founding members of Sällskapet Idun, a men&#x27;s association founded in Stockholm.

In 1863 he married Anna Maria Mannerheim, the aunt of Marshal C. G. E. Mannerheim.

=== Settling in Stockholm, and Arctic exploration ===
Nordenskiöld settled in Stockholm, and soon he received an offer from Otto Torell, a geologist, to accompany him on an expedition to Spitsbergen. To the observations of Torell on glacial phenomena Nordenskiöld added the discovery at Bell Sound of remains of Tertiary plants, and on the return of the expedition he received the appointment of a curator and Director of the Mineralogical Department of the Swedish Museum of Natural History &quot;(Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet)&quot; and a professorship in Mineralogy at the Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was also awarded the 1869 Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Medal.

Nordenskiöld&#x27;s participation in three geological expeditions to Spitsbergen, followed by longer Arctic explorations in 1867, 1870, 1872 and 1875, led him to attempt the discovery of the long-sought Northeast Passage. This he accomplished in the voyage of the &quot;SS Vega&quot;, navigating for the first time the northern coasts of Europe and Asia. Starting from Karlskrona on 22 June 1878, the &quot;Vega&quot; doubled Cape Chelyuskin in the following August, and after being frozen in at the end of September near the Bering Strait, completed the voyage successfully in the following summer. He edited a monumental record of the expedition in five volumes, and himself wrote a more popular summary in two volumes. On his return to Sweden he received an enthusiastic welcome, and in April 1880 was made a baron and a commander of the Order of the North Star.

In 1883, he visited the east coast of Greenland for the second time, and succeeded in taking his ship through the great ice barrier, a feat attempted in vain during more than three centuries. The captain on the &quot;Vega&quot; expedition, Louis Palander, was made a nobleman at the same time, and took the name &quot;Palander af Vega&quot;.

=== Later life and death ===
In 1893, Nordenskiöld was elected to the 12th chair of the Swedish Academy. In 1900 he received the Murchison Medal from the Geological Society of London. He was nominated for the first Nobel Prize in Physics but died before the prizes were awarded.

Nordenskiöld died on 12 August 1901, in Dalbyö, Södermanland, Sweden, at the age of 68.

==Historian of early cartography==
As an explorer, Nordenskiöld was interested in the history of Arctic exploration, especially as evidenced in old maps. This interest in turn led him to collect and systematically study early maps. He wrote two substantial monographs, which both included many facsimiles, on early printed atlases and geographical mapping and medieval marine charts, respectively the &quot;Facsimile-Atlas to the Early History of Cartography&quot; (1889) and &quot;Periplus: An essay on the early history of charts and sailing directions&quot; (1897).

He left his huge personal collection of early maps to the University of Helsinki, and it was inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register in 1997.

==Expeditions==
* In 1858, Nordenskiöld took part in Torell&#x27;s first expedition to Svalbard in the sloop &quot;Frithiof&quot;. The expedition made biological and geological observations along the coast of Spitsbergen.
* In 1861, he took part in Torell&#x27;s second Svalbard expedition on board the &quot;Æolus&quot;. This included a boat journey along the scarcely explored northern coast of Nordaustlandet as far as Prins Oscars Land. They also began to measure a meridian arc, but did not complete the work.
* In 1864, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences placed Nordenskiöld in command of the schooner &quot;Axel Thordsen&quot; to complete the meridian arc survey. After conducting the necessary measurements in the south of Svalbard, they rescued 27 men who had to abandon their ice-locked ships.
* In 1868 on the schooner-rigged iron steamer &quot;Sofia&quot;, he went farther north than any vessel had ever been in the Eastern hemisphere. He reached , surpassing William Scoresby&#x27;s previous record by 12&#x27;.
* In 1870, he visited Greenland to find out whether using sledge dogs was advisable for a polar expedition. He came to the conclusion that it would be impractical to procure and rely on a large number of dogs from Greenland in view of recent outbreaks of a contagious dog sickness. He made a journey ca. onto the inland ice. At Uivfaq on Disko Island, several large blocks of native iron were found that Nordenskiöld assumed to be meteorites. Nowadays it is thought that the iron accumulated in basalt formations through volcanic eruptions.
* In 1872, Nordenskiöld embarked on an expedition to reach the North Pole using reindeer. To this end, the steamer &quot;Polhem&quot;, the steamer &quot;Onkel Adam&quot;, and the brig &quot;Gladan&quot; met by Spitsbergen. At Mosselbukta, the three ships were unexpectedly frozen in. Nordenskiöld was faced with feeding the 67 men throughout the winter, as well as helping out the crews from six Norwegian hunting vessels that had suffered the same fate. The situation was worsened when all but one of the reindeer escaped. Instead of a sledge journey to the pole, only a trip to Nordaustlandet could be undertaken during which one expedition member disappeared while searching for driftwood. The supplies ran dangerously low and scurvy was rampant. Only one sailor succumbed to it however, because Benjamin Leigh Smith on the steamer &quot;Diana&quot; found the beset ships and donated his provisions. Two weeks later, the ice opened up and the ships could return to Sweden.
* In 1875, he went to the Yenisei River in Siberia, on board the sloop &quot;Pröven&quot;, which he sent back while he went up the river in a boat and returned home by land.
* In 1876, Nordenskiöld repeated the journey to the mouth of the Yenisei with the steamer &quot;Ymer&quot; to prove that this route was not dependent on unusually favourable ice conditions.
* In 1878–1879 he was the first to complete the entire Northeast passage along the northern coast of Eurasia. This he accomplished in the voyage of the &quot;Vega&quot;. Starting from Karlskrona on 22 June 1878, the &quot;Vega&quot; doubled Cape Chelyuskin in August. &quot;Vega&quot; was initially accompanied by the ships &quot;Lena&quot;, &quot;Fraser&quot;, and &quot;Express&quot;. The latter two parted way at the mouth of the Yenisei and traveled upstream. &quot;Lena&quot; navigated up the River Lena to Yakutsk. At the end of September, &quot;Vega&quot; was frozen in near the Bering Strait and passed the winter among the coastal Chukchi. By sailing through Bering Strait in July 1879, &quot;Vega&quot; completed the Northeast Passage.
* In 1882–1883 – &quot;2nd Dickson Expedition&quot; (&quot;Den andra Dicksonska Expeditionen till Grönland&quot;), he took &quot;Sofia&quot; to Disko Bay where, together with three Saami, he made an expedition to the inland ice sheet. He expected the interior of Greenland to be ice-free and perhaps covered in forests. Nordenskiöld quickly had to give up due to technical problems, but the Saami penetrated 230 kilometres eastward before returning. On the east coast of Greenland, the expedition penetrated the great ice barrier—as the first after 300 years of attempts—and landed at Ammasalik (&quot;Kung Oscars Hamn&quot;) 65° 37&#x27; N, only slightly to the north of where Wilhelm August Graah was forced to turn his Umiak expedition round in 1830.

<text>Restoration Path, known as Love in Action (LIA) until March 2012, was an ex-gay Christian ministry founded in 1973.

==History==
The organization was founded in 1973 by Frank Worthen, John Evans, and Kent Philpott in Marin County, California, just north of San Francisco. In 2010, Tommy Corman became the Executive Director of Love In Action. In March 2012, Love In Action changed its name to Restoration Path. In October 2012, David Jones became the executive director of Restoration Path; as of August 2018, he remains the Executive Director.

On July 5, 2007, Love in Action announced the initiation of Family Freedom Intensive, a monthly four-day program for parents with teens &quot;struggling with same-sex attraction, pornography, and/or promiscuity&quot;. Teenagers who they would like to join their parents may be considered for inclusion. As of 2018, there is no mention of this program on the Restoration Path website.

As of October 2019, both the organization&#x27;s website and Facebook page were offline. According to the California Secretary of State, the organization has been dissolved.

==Controversies==
After Jack McIntyre, a friend of co-founder John Evans, died by suicide because of his inability to change, Evans left Love in Action and denounced it as dangerous. He said: &quot;They&#x27;re destroying people&#x27;s lives. If you don&#x27;t do their thing, you&#x27;re not of God, you&#x27;ll go to hell. They&#x27;re living in a fantasy world.&quot;

John Smid recounts becoming a Christian in 1982. He found that his religious conviction was incompatible with his homosexuality. He entered into a relationship with a woman and married. In 1986 he joined the leadership of Love In Action, eventually becoming executive director. Smid left LIA in 2008. In 2011, on his website, he stated that homosexuality is an intrinsic part of one&#x27;s being, and that &quot;change, repentance, reorientation and such&quot; cannot occur, and noted that he had &quot;never met a man who experienced a change from homosexual to heterosexual&quot;. On November 16 2014, John Smid married his same-sex partner, Larry McQueen.

===Zach Stark===
In June 2005, a 16-year-old Tennessee boy, Zach Stark, posted a blog entry on his MySpace site, part of which includes:

Somewhat recently, as many of you know, I told my parents I was gay... Well today, my mother, father, and I had a very long &quot;talk&quot; in my room where they let me know I am to apply for a fundamentalist christian program for gays. They tell me that there is something psychologically wrong with me, and they &quot;raised me wrong.&quot; I&#x27;m a big screw up to them, who isn&#x27;t on the path God wants me to be on. So I&#x27;m sitting here in tears, joing the rest of those kids who complain about their parents on blogs - and I can&#x27;t help it.

The program Stark noted is a Love In Action-run camp known as Refuge.

On August 14, Stark updated his blog, stating that LIA had not pressured him into doing anything and he got along well with most of the clients there. He said his parents no longer let him hang out with girls as friends because it was unhealthy and that his father had asked him to stop blogging. Stark has since accepted his homosexuality, and appears in the documentary from director Morgan Jon Fox, entitled &quot;This Is What Love In Action Looks Like&quot;, which features an exclusive interview with Stark about the controversy.

A Tennessee investigation against the camp began shortly after Stark&#x27;s story appeared online. As of June 28, 2005, the investigation was dropped, with Tennessee officials citing a lack of evidence of child abuse at the facilities. &quot;Department of Children&#x27;s Services dispatched its special investigations unit to the facility, and after conducting a full investigation, determined that the child abuse allegations were unfounded&quot;, Rob Johnson, an agency spokesman, told the Associated Press. On September 12, 2005, the Tennessee-based Love in Action facility was determined by the Tennessee Department of Mental Health to have been operating two &quot;unlicensed mental health supportive living facilities&quot;. LIA stopped accepting the mentally ill and dispensing medications and, in February 2006, the state of Tennessee ceased legal action.

In 2005, Tommy Corman, the spokesman for Love In Action, said the facility did not need to be licensed because it was &quot;not doing anything therapeutic&quot;.

Love in Action sued the state of Tennessee for discrimination against the facility. The suit was settled on October 27, 2006. Tennessee agreed that Love in Action would not need licensing as a mental health facility, and LIA agreed to make sure none of its employees administered or regulated the medication of its clients. The state of Tennessee was told to pay Love in Action&#x27;s legal fees.

In June 2007, LIA discontinued the Refuge program.

==In media==
The 2012 book &quot;The Miseducation of Cameron Post&quot;, the debut novel of American author Emily M. Danforth, was inspired by the Stark controversy. The book was adapted as a 2018 film with the same name.

The program is described in the 2016 book &quot;Boy Erased: A Memoir&quot; by Garrard Conley. The book was adapted in 2018 as &quot;Boy Erased&quot;, a film directed by Joel Edgerton starring Lucas Hedges.

<doc id="292333" wikidata="Q6961879" url="?curid=292333" title="Naming of military air bases">
<text>Most countries with military aviation forces have a system for naming of military airbases. &quot;Air Force Base&quot; (&quot;AFB&quot;) is part of the name of military airbases of the United States Air Force (USAF) and the South African Air Force (SAAF), with the USAF using it at the end of the name of the base (e.g. &quot;Dover AFB&quot;), and the SAAF using it at the start (e.g. &quot;AFB Hoedspruit&quot;). The Royal Australian Air Force uses a slightly different format referring to bases as &quot;RAAF Base&quot; (Royal Australian Air Force Base). The Canadian Forces also uses a different format referring to any base as &quot;CFB&quot; (Canadian Forces Base) or &quot;BFC&quot; in French (&quot;Base des Forces Canadiennes&quot;).

== Naming of British airbases ==
The Royal Air Force (RAF) identify their bases as &quot;Royal Air Force stations&quot;, but for modern purposes this is usually abbreviated to &quot;RAF&quot; plus the name, e.g. RAF Marham. They are generally named after the closest railway station as rail travel was the main means of transport for service personnel in the early days of the RAF. Many RAF stations have long since lost their local railway station. Other bases were named after the local village, or used the name of the building in which they resided, such as RAF Bentley Priory. There is no difference in nomenclature for non-flying RAF stations, and overseas RAF stations have followed the same principles.

The aviation division of the Royal Navy, the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) generally follow the same principles of naming as the RAF, but are instead prefixed with Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS), such as RNAS Yeovilton. However, in maintaining the maritime link, all Royal Navy air stations are additionally named in the same manner as the Navy&#x27;s ships – in Yeoviltons&#x27; instance, it is also called HMS Heron.

The British Army Air Corps uses a variety of terms due to the very mixed nature of its bases, sharing facilities with the RAF (at RAF Odiham), the Royal Navy (at RNAS Yeovilton), the tri-service Joint Aviation Command (at Aldergrove Flying Station), and the SAS (at Stirling Lines, Hereford). The remaining two bases are Middle Wallop Flying Station, and Wattisham Flying Station, formerly &#x27;Wattisham Airfield&#x27;, and before that RAF Wattisham.

== Naming of United States airbases ==

United States Air Force bases are often but not always named after a person of military or governmental significance. Examples include Edwards Air Force Base, Selfridge Air National Guard Base and General Mitchell Air Reserve Base. Sometimes bases are named after a nearby city. Examples include Little Rock Air Force Base, Dover Air Force Base, and Los Angeles Air Force Base. &quot;Air Force Station&quot; is usually used in the name of those with very little or no flight activity, although there are cases where installations with no flight activity use the term Base instead of Station (e.g., Bolling Air Force Base). USAF bases located in other countries are usually named after the city or region where they&#x27;re located and are referred to as Air Bases rather than Air &quot;Force&quot; Bases (e.g. Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany). (For USAF bases in the UK, see section below)

The United States Army call their air bases &quot;Army Airfields&quot; and like the Air Force, names most of them after a military or government figure (e.g. Biggs Army Airfield). Some Army Airfields are named for the Army base where they&#x27;re located as well (e.g. Campbell Army Airfield, located at Fort Campbell). The Army also has &quot;Army Heliports&quot; such as Hanchey Army Heliport. As titled, these airfields are used by helicopters only.

The United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard generally prefer to name their bases for the area where they&#x27;re located (e.g. Naval Air Station Pensacola, &#x27;NAS Pensacola&#x27;, Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, &#x27;MCAS Cherry Point&#x27; and Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City). This is also to avoid longer names given by the pilots if names of persons are added. The Navy also operates a number of &quot;Naval Outlying Landing Fields&quot;, auxiliary air fields primarily used for flight training purposes.

There are also a number of &quot;joint air bases&quot; throughout the U.S. These bases are owned &amp; operated by one particular military component (usually the US Navy or US Air Force) and will have other military units (and sometimes non-military governmental air units) garrisoned at the base. Examples include Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans, Minneapolis–Saint Paul Joint Air Reserve Station, and Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth.

== USAFE bases in Britain ==
US bases located in the United Kingdom exist on land owned by the (UK) Ministry of Defence, and are identified on road signage as if they were simply RAF bases e.g. &#x27;RAF Lakenheath&#x27;. This principle extends to USAF media (e.g. usafe.af.mil), mainstream US media (e.g. NBC News), and signs at main entrances such as &#x27;Royal Air Force / Mildenhall / United States Air Force&#x27;.
Other examples of USAF bases located in the UK include; RAF Alconbury, RAF Lakenheath, RAF Bentwaters/RAF Woodbridge (closed), RAF Upper Heyford (closed), RAF Burtonwood (closed), RAF Sculthorpe, RAF Molesworth, etc.

<doc id="292340" wikidata="Q3561192" url="?curid=292340" title="Flavonoid">
<text>Flavonoids (or bioflavonoids; from the Latin word &quot;flavus&quot;, meaning yellow, their color in nature) are a class of polyphenols or polyphenolic secondary metabolites found in plants, and thus commonly consumed in the diets of humans.

Chemically, flavonoids have the general structure of a 15-carbon skeleton, which consists of two phenyl rings (A and B) and a heterocyclic ring (C, the ring containing the embedded oxygen). This carbon structure can be abbreviated C6-C3-C6. According to the IUPAC nomenclature,
they can be classified into:
*flavonoids or bioflavonoids
*isoflavonoids, derived from 3-phenylchromen-4-one (3-phenyl-1,4-benzopyrone) structure
*neoflavonoids, derived from 4-phenylcoumarin (4-phenyl-1,2-benzopyrone) structure

The three flavonoid classes above are all ketone-containing compounds and as such, anthoxanthins (flavones and flavonols). This class was the first to be termed bioflavonoids. The terms flavonoid and bioflavonoid have also been more loosely used to describe non-ketone polyhydroxy polyphenol compounds, which are more specifically termed flavanoids. The three cycles or heterocycles in the flavonoid backbone are generally called ring A, B, and C. Ring A usually shows a phloroglucinol substitution pattern.

== History ==
In the 1930s, Albert Szent-Györgyi and other scientists discovered that Vitamin C alone was not as effective at preventing scurvy as the crude yellow extract from oranges, lemons or paprika. They attributed the increased activity of this extract to the other substances in this mixture, which they referred to as &quot;citrin&quot; (referring to citrus) or &quot;Vitamin P&quot; (a reference to its effect on reducing the permeability of capillaries). The substances in question (hesperidin, eriodictyol, hesperidin methyl chalcone and neohesperidin) were however later shown not to fulfil the criteria of a vitamin, so that this term is now obsolete.

== Biosynthesis ==

Flavonoids are secondary metabolites synthesized mainly by plants. The general structure of flavonoids is a fifteen-carbon skeleton, containing two benzene rings connected by a three-carbon linking chain. Therefore, they are depicted as C6-C3-C6 compounds. Depending on the chemical structure, degree of oxidation, and unsaturation of the linking chain (C3), flavonoids can be classified into different groups, such as anthocyanidins, flavonols, flavanones, flavan-3-ols, flavanonols, flavones, and isoflavones. Chalcones, also called chalconoids, although lacking the heterocyclic ring, are also classified as flavonoids. Furthermore, flavonoids can be found in plants in glycoside-bound and free aglycone forms. The glycoside-bound form is the most common flavone and flavonol form consumed in the diet.


==Functions of flavonoids in plants==
Flavonoids are widely distributed in plants, fulfilling many functions. They are the most important plant pigments for flower coloration, producing yellow or red/blue pigmentation in petals designed to attract pollinator animals. In higher plants, they are involved in UV filtration, symbiotic nitrogen fixation, and floral pigmentation. They may also act as chemical messengers, physiological regulators, and cell cycle inhibitors. Flavonoids secreted by the root of their host plant help &quot;Rhizobia&quot; in the infection stage of their symbiotic relationship with legumes like peas, beans, clover, and soy. Rhizobia living in soil are able to sense the flavonoids and this triggers the secretion of Nod factors, which in turn are recognized by the host plant and can lead to root hair deformation and several cellular responses such as ion fluxes and the formation of a root nodule. In addition, some flavonoids have inhibitory activity against organisms that cause plant diseases, e.g. &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot;.

==Subgroups==
Over 5000 naturally occurring flavonoids have been characterized from various plants. They have been classified according to their chemical structure, and are usually subdivided into the following subgroups (for further reading see):

===Anthocyanidins===

Anthocyanidins are the aglycones of anthocyanins; they use the flavylium (2-phenylchromenylium) ion skeleton.
:Examples: cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, petunidin

===Anthoxanthins===
Anthoxanthins are divided into two groups:

===Flavanones===
Flavanones
===Flavanonols===
Flavanonols
===Flavans===

Include flavan-3-ols (flavanols), flavan-4-ols and flavan-3,4-diols.

*Flavan-3-ols (flavanols)
** Flavan-&quot;3-ols&quot; use the 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2&quot;H&quot;-chromen-&quot;3-ol&quot; skeleton
*:Examples: Catechin (C), Gallocatechin (GC), Catechin 3-gallate (Cg), Gallocatechin 3-gallate (GCg), Epicatechins (Epicatechin (EC)), Epigallocatechin (EGC), Epicatechin 3-gallate (ECg), Epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCg)
** Theaflavin
*:Examples: Theaflavin-3-gallate, Theaflavin-3&#x27;-gallate, Theaflavin-3,3&#x27;-digallate
** Thearubigin
** Proanthocyanidins are dimers, trimers, oligomers, or polymers of the flavanols

===Isoflavonoids===
*Isoflavonoids
**Isoflavones use the 3-phenylchromen-&quot;4-one&quot; skeleton (with no hydroxyl group substitution on carbon at position 2) 
*:Examples: Genistein, Daidzein, Glycitein
**Isoflavanes
**Isoflavandiols
**Isoflavenes
**Coumestans
**Pterocarpans

==Dietary sources==


Flavonoids (specifically flavanoids such as the catechins) are &quot;the most common group of polyphenolic compounds in the human diet and are found ubiquitously in plants&quot;. Flavonols, the original bioflavonoids such as quercetin, are also found ubiquitously, but in lesser quantities. The widespread distribution of flavonoids, their variety and their relatively low toxicity compared to other active plant compounds (for instance alkaloids) mean that many animals, including humans, ingest significant quantities in their diet. 

Foods with a high flavonoid content include parsley, onions, blueberries and strawberries, black tea, bananas, and citrus fruits. One study found high flavonoid content in buckwheat.

Citrus flavonoids include hesperidin (a glycoside of the flavanone hesperetin), quercitrin, rutin (two glycosides of quercetin, and the flavone tangeritin. The flavonoids are less concentrated in the pulp than in the peels (for example, 165 versus 1156 mg/100 g in pulp versus peel of satsuma mandarin, and 164 vis-à-vis 804 mg/100 g in pulp versus peel of clementine).

Peanut (red) skin contains significant polyphenol content, including flavonoids.

==Dietary intake==
Food composition data for flavonoids were provided by the USDA database on flavonoids. In the United States NHANES survey, mean flavonoid intake was 190 mg per day in adults, with flavan-3-ols as the main contributor. In the European Union, based on data from EFSA, mean flavonoid intake was 140 mg/d, although there were considerable differences among individual countries. The main type of flavonoids consumed in the EU and USA were flavan-3-ols (80% for USA adults), mainly from tea or cocoa in chocolate, while intake of other flavonoids was considerably lower.
== Research ==
Neither the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nor the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has approved any flavonoids as prescription drugs. The U.S. FDA has warned numerous dietary supplement and food manufacturers, including Unilever, producer of Lipton tea in the U.S., about illegal advertising and misleading health claims regarding flavonoids, such as that they lower cholesterol or relieve pain.

===Metabolism and excretion===
Flavonoids are poorly absorbed in the human body (less than 5%), then are quickly metabolized into smaller fragments with unknown properties, and rapidly excreted. Flavonoids have negligible antioxidant activity in the body, and the increase in antioxidant capacity of blood seen after consumption of flavonoid-rich foods is not caused directly by flavonoids, but by production of uric acid resulting from flavonoid depolymerization and excretion. Microbial metabolism is a major contributor to the overall metabolism of dietary flavonoids.

===Inflammation===
Inflammation has been implicated as a possible origin of numerous local and systemic diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus, and celiac disease. There is no clinical evidence that dietary flavonoids affect any of these diseases.

===Cancer===
Clinical studies investigating the relationship between flavonoid consumption and cancer prevention or development are conflicting for most types of cancer, probably because most human studies have weak designs, such as a small sample size. There is little evidence to indicate that dietary flavonoids affect human cancer risk in general.

===Cardiovascular diseases===

Although no significant association has been found between flavan-3-ol intake and cardiovascular disease mortality, clinical trials have shown improved endothelial function and reduced blood pressure (with a few studies showing inconsistent results). Reviews of cohort studies in 2013 found that the studies had too many limitations to determine a possible relationship between increased flavonoid intake and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, although a trend for an inverse relationship existed.

In 2013, the EFSA decided to permit health claims that 200 mg/day of cocoa flavanols &quot;help[s] maintain the elasticity of blood vessels.&quot; The FDA followed suit in 2023, stating that there is &quot;supportive, but not conclusive&quot; evidence that 200 mg per day of cocoa flavanols can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. This is greater than the levels found in typical chocolate bars, which can also contribute to weight gain, potentially harming cardiovascular health.

== Synthesis, detection, quantification, and semi-synthetic alterations ==

=== Color spectrum ===
Flavonoid synthesis in plants is induced by light color spectrums at both high and low energy radiations. Low energy radiations are accepted by phytochrome, while high energy radiations are accepted by carotenoids, flavins, cryptochromes in addition to phytochromes. The photomorphogenic process of phytochrome-mediated flavonoid biosynthesis has been observed in &quot;Amaranthus&quot;, barley, maize, &quot;Sorghum&quot; and turnip. Red light promotes flavonoid synthesis.

=== Availability through microorganisms ===
Research has shown production of flavonoid molecules from genetically engineered microorganisms.

=== Tests for detection ===
====Shinoda test====
Four pieces of magnesium filings are added to the ethanolic extract followed by few drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid. A pink or red colour indicates the presence of flavonoid. Colours varying from orange to red indicated flavones, red to crimson indicated flavonoids, crimson to magenta indicated flavonones.

====Sodium hydroxide test====
About 5 mg of the compound is dissolved in water, warmed, and filtered. 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide is added to 2 ml of this solution. This produces a yellow coloration. A change in color from yellow to colorless on addition of dilute hydrochloric acid is an indication for the presence of flavonoids.

====p-Dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde test====
A colorimetric assay based upon the reaction of A-rings with the chromogen p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (DMACA) has been developed for flavanoids in beer that can be compared with the vanillin procedure.

=== Quantification ===
Lamaison and Carnet have designed a test for the determination of the total flavonoid content of a sample (AlCI3 method). After proper mixing of the sample and the reagent, the mixture is incubated for ten minutes at ambient temperature and the absorbance of the solution is read at 440 nm. Flavonoid content is expressed in mg/g of quercetin.

=== Semi-synthetic alterations ===
Immobilized &quot;Candida antarctica&quot; lipase can be used to catalyze the regioselective acylation of flavonoids.

<text>French Algeria ( until 1839, then afterwards; unofficially , ), also known as Colonial Algeria, was the period of Algerian history when the country was a colony and later an integral part of France. French rule lasted until the end of the Algerian War which resulted in Algeria gaining independence on 5 July 1962.

The French conquest of Algeria began in 1830 with the invasion of Algiers which toppled the Regency of Algiers, though Algeria was not fully conquered and pacified until 1903. It is estimated that by 1875, approximately 825,000 indigenous Algerians were killed. Various scholars describe the French conquest as genocide. Algeria was ruled as a colony from 1830 to 1848, and then as multiple departments, an integral part of France, with the implementing of the Constitution of French Second Republic on 4 November 1848, until Algerian independence in 1962. For a period between 1860 and 1870, the then-French emperor Napoleon III transformed Algeria into a client state, expanding freedoms and limiting colonisation (an unpopular stance with the French colonists).

As a recognized jurisdiction of France, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of European immigrants. They were first known as &quot;colons&quot;, and later as , a term applied primarily to ethnic Europeans born in Algeria. The indigenous Muslim population comprised the majority of the territory throughout its history. Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, due to their lack of political and economic freedom, fueled calls for greater political autonomy, and eventually independence from France. The Sétif and Guelma massacre, in 1945, marked a point of no return in Franco-Algerian relations and led to the outbreak of the Algerian War which was characterised by the use guerrilla warfare by National Liberation Front, and crimes against humanity by the French. The war ended in 1962, with Algeria gaining independence following the Évian Accords in March 1962 and a self-determination referendum in July 1962.

During its last years as part of France, Algeria was a founding member of the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community.

==History==

===Initial conflicts===

Since the capture of Algiers in 1516 by the Ottoman admirals, brothers Ours and Hayreddin Barbarossa, Algeria had been a base for conflict and piracy in the Mediterranean basin. In 1681, French King Louis XIV asked Admiral Abraham Duquesne to fight the Berber pirates. He also ordered a large-scale attack on Algiers between 1682 and 1683 on the pretext of assisting and rescuing enslaved Christians, usually Europeans taken as captives in raids. Again, Jean II d&#x27;Estrées bombarded Tripoli and Algiers from 1685 to 1688. An ambassador from Algiers visited the Court in Versailles, and a treaty was signed in 1690 that provided peace throughout the 18th century.

During the Directory regime of the First French Republic (1795–99), the Bacri and the Busnach, Jewish merchants of Algiers, provided large quantities of grain for Napoleon&#x27;s soldiers who participated in the Italian campaign of 1796-1797. But Bonaparte refused to pay the bill, claiming it was excessive. In 1820, Louis XVIII paid back half of the Directory&#x27;s debts. The Dey, who had loaned the Bacri 250,000 francs, requested the rest of the money from France.
The Dey of Algiers was weak politically, economically, and militarily. Algeria was then part of the Barbary States, along with today&#x27;s Tunisia; these depended on the Ottoman Empire, then led by Mahmud II but enjoyed relative independence. The Barbary Coast was the stronghold of Berber pirates, who carried out raids against European and American ships. Conflicts between the Barbary States and the newly independent United States of America culminated in the First (1801–05) and Second (1815) Barbary Wars. An Anglo-Dutch force, led by Admiral Lord Exmouth, carried out a punitive expedition, the August 1816 bombardment of Algiers. The Dey was forced to sign the Barbary treaties, because the technological advantage of U.S., British, and French forces overwhelmed the Algerians&#x27; expertise at naval warfare.

Following the conquest under the July monarchy, France referred to the Algerian territories as &quot;French possessions in North Africa&quot;. This was disputed by the Ottoman Empire, which had not given up its claim. In 1839 Marshal General Jean-de-Dieu Soult, Duke of Dalmatia, first named these territories as &quot;Algeria&quot;.

===French conquest of Algeria===

The invasion of Algeria against the Regency of Algiers (Ottoman Algeria) was initiated in the last days of the Bourbon Restoration by Charles X, as an attempt to increase his popularity amongst the French people. He particularly hoped to appeal to the many veterans of the Napoleonic Wars who lived in Paris. His intention was to bolster patriotic sentiment, and distract attention from ineptly handled domestic policies by &quot;skirmishing against the dey.&quot;

====Fly Whisk Incident (April 1827)====

In the 1790s, France had contracted to purchase wheat for the French army from two merchants in Algiers, Messrs. Bacri and Boushnak, and was in arrears paying them. Bacri and Boushnak owed money to the dey and claimed they could not pay it until France paid its debts to them. The dey had unsuccessfully negotiated with Pierre Deval, the French consul, to rectify this situation, and he suspected Deval of collaborating with the merchants against him, especially when the French government made no provisions in 1820 to pay the merchants. Deval&#x27;s nephew Alexandre, the consul in Bône, further angered the dey by fortifying French storehouses in Bône and La Calle, contrary to the terms of prior agreements.

After a contentious meeting in which Deval refused to provide satisfactory answers on 29 April 1827, the dey struck Deval with his fly whisk. Charles X used this slight against his diplomatic representative to first demand an apology from the dey, and then to initiate a blockade against the port of Algiers. France demanded that the dey send an ambassador to France to resolve the incident. When the dey responded with cannon fire directed toward one of the blockading ships, the French determined that more forceful action was required.

====Invasion of Algiers (June 1830)====


Pierre Deval and other French residents of Algiers left for France, while the Minister of War, Clermont-Tonnerre, proposed a military expedition. However, the Count of Villèle, an ultra-royalist, President of the council and the monarch&#x27;s heir, opposed any military action. The Bourbon Restoration government finally decided to blockade Algiers for three years. Meanwhile, the Berber pirates were able to exploit the geography of the coast with ease. Before the failure of the blockade, the Restoration decided on 31 January 1830 to engage a military expedition against Algiers.

Admiral Duperré commanded an armada of 600 ships that originated from Toulon, leading it to Algiers. Using Napoleon&#x27;s 1808 contingency plan for the invasion of Algeria, General de Bourmont then landed west of Algiers, at Sidi Ferruch on 14 June 1830, with 34,000 soldiers. In response to the French, the Algerian dey ordered an opposition consisting of 7,000 janissaries, 19,000 troops from the beys of Constantine and Oran, and about 17,000 Kabyles. The French established a strong beachhead and pushed toward Algiers, thanks in part to superior artillery and better organization. The French troops took the advantage on 19 June during the battle of Staouéli, and entered Algiers on 5 July after a three-week campaign. The dey agreed to surrender in exchange for his freedom and the offer to retain possession of his personal wealth. Five days later, he exiled himself with his family, departing on a French ship for the Italian peninsula. 2,500 janissaries also quit the Algerian territories, heading for Asia, on 11 July.

The French army then recruited the first (a title given to certain light infantry regiments) in October, followed by the regiments, while France expropriated all the land properties belonging to the Turkish settlers, known as . In the western region of Oran, Sultan Abderrahmane of Morocco, the Commander of the Faithful, could not remain indifferent to the massacres committed by the French Christian troops and to belligerent calls for jihad from the marabouts. Despite the diplomatic rupture between Morocco and the Two Sicilies in 1830, and the naval warfare engaged against the Austrian Empire as well as with Spain, then headed by Ferdinand VII, Sultan Abderrahmane lent his support to the Algerian insurgency of Abd El-Kader. The latter fought for years against the French. Directing an army of 12,000 men, Abd El-Kader first organized the blockade of Oran.

Algerian refugees were welcomed by the Moroccan population, while the Sultan recommended that the authorities of Tetuan assist them, by providing jobs in the administration or the military forces. The inhabitants of Tlemcen, near the Moroccan border, asked that they be placed under the Sultan&#x27;s authority in order to escape the invaders. Abderrahmane named his nephew Prince Moulay Ali Caliph of Tlemcen, charged with the protection of the city. In retaliation France executed two Moroccans: Mohamed Beliano and Benkirane, as spies, while their goods were seized by the military governor of Oran, Pierre François Xavier Boyer.

Hardly had the news of the capture of Algiers reached Paris than Charles X was deposed during the Three Glorious Days of July 1830, and his cousin Louis-Philippe, the &quot;citizen king ,&quot; was named to preside over a constitutional monarchy. The new government, composed of liberal opponents of the Algiers expedition, was reluctant to pursue the conquest begun by the old regime, but withdrawing from Algeria proved more difficult than conquering it.

Alexis de Tocqueville&#x27;s views on Algeria were instrumental in its brutal and formal colonization. He advocated for a mixed system of &quot;total domination and total colonization&quot; whereby French military would wage total war against civilian populations while a colonial administration would provide rule of law and property rights to settlers within French occupied cities.

====Characterization as genocide====

Some governments and scholars have called France&#x27;s conquest of Algeria a genocide.

For example, Ben Kiernan, an Australian expert on Cambodian genocide wrote in &quot;Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur&quot; on the French conquest of Algeria:

&quot;By 1875, the French conquest was complete. The war had killed approximately 825,000 indigenous Algerians since 1830. A long shadow of genocidal hatred persisted, provoking a French author to protest in 1882 that in Algeria, &quot;we hear it repeated every day that we must expel the native and, if necessary, destroy him.&quot; As a French statistical journal urged five years later, &quot;the system of extermination must give way to a policy of penetration.&quot;&quot;

—Ben Kiernan, &quot;Blood and Soil&quot;
When France recognized the Armenian genocide, Turkey accused France of having committed genocide against 15% of Algeria&#x27;s population.

==Popular revolts against the French occupation==

===Conquest of the Algerian territories under the July Monarchy (1830–1848)===

On 1 December 1830, King Louis-Philippe named the Duc de Rovigo as head of military staff in Algeria. De Rovigo took control of Bône and initiated colonisation of the land. He was recalled in 1833 due to the overtly violent nature of the repression. Wishing to avoid a conflict with Morocco, Louis-Philippe sent an extraordinary mission to the sultan, mixed with displays of military might, sending war ships to the Bay of Tangier. An ambassador was sent to Sultan Moulay Abderrahmane in February 1832, headed by the Count Charles-Edgar de Mornay and including the painter Eugène Delacroix. However the sultan refused French demands that he evacuate Tlemcen.

In 1834, France annexed as a colony the occupied areas of Algeria, which had an estimated Muslim population of about two million. Colonial administration in the occupied areas — the so-called (government of the sword) — was placed under a governor-general, a high-ranking army officer invested with civil and military jurisdiction, who was responsible to the minister of war. Marshal Bugeaud, who became the first governor-general, headed the conquest.

Soon after the conquest of Algiers, the soldier-politician Bertrand Clauzel and others formed a company to acquire agricultural land and, despite official discouragement, to subsidize its settlement by European farmers, triggering a land rush. Clauzel recognized the farming potential of the Mitidja Plain and envisioned the large-scale production there of cotton. As governor-general (1835–36), he used his office to make private investments in land and encouraged army officers and bureaucrats in his administration to do the same. This development created a vested interest among government officials in greater French involvement in Algeria. Commercial interests with influence in the government also began to recognize the prospects for profitable land speculation in expanding the French zone of occupation. They created large agricultural tracts, built factories and businesses, and hired local labor.

Among others testimonies, Lieutenant-colonel Lucien de Montagnac wrote on 15 March 1843, in a letter to a friend:
All populations who do not accept our conditions must be despoiled. Everything must be seized, devastated, without age or sex distinction: grass must not grow any more where the French army has set foot. Who wants the end wants the means, whatever may say our philanthropists. I personally warn all good soldiers whom I have the honour to lead that if they happen to bring me a living Arab, they will receive a beating with the flat of the saber... This is how, my dear friend, we must make war against Arabs: kill all men over the age of fifteen, take all their women and children, load them onto naval vessels, send them to the Marquesas Islands or elsewhere. In one word, annihilate everything that will not crawl beneath our feet like dogs.

Whatever initial misgivings Louis Philippe&#x27;s government may have had about occupying Algeria, the geopolitical realities of the situation created by the 1830 intervention argued strongly for reinforcing French presence there. France had reason for concern that Britain, which was pledged to maintain the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire, would move to fill the vacuum left by a French withdrawal. The French devised elaborate plans for settling the hinterland left by Ottoman provincial authorities in 1830, but their efforts at state-building were unsuccessful on account of lengthy armed resistance.
The most successful local opposition immediately after the fall of Algiers was led by Ahmad ibn Muhammad, of Constantine. He initiated a radical overhaul of the Ottoman administration in his by replacing Turkish officials with local leaders, making Arabic the official language, and attempting to reform finances according to the precepts of Islam. After the French failed in several attempts to gain some of the &#x27;s territories through negotiation, an ill-fated invasion force, led by Bertrand Clauzel, had to retreat from Constantine in 1836 in humiliation and defeat. However, the French captured Constantine under Sylvain Charles Valée the following year, on 13 October 1837.

Historians generally set the indigenous population of Algeria at 3 million in 1830. Although the Algerian population decreased at some point under French rule, most certainly between 1866 and 1872, the French military was not fully responsible for the extent of this decrease, as some of these deaths could be explained by the locust plagues of 1866 and 1868, as well as by a rigorous winter in 1867–68, which caused a famine followed by an epidemic of cholera.

The French began their occupation of Algiers in 1830, starting with a landing in Algiers. As occupation turned into colonization, Kabylia remained the only region independent of the French government. Pressure on the region increased, and the will of her people to resist and defend Kabylia increased as well.

In about 1849, a mysterious man arrived in Kabiliya. He presented himself as Mohamed ben Abdallah (the name of the Prophet), but is more commonly known as Sherif Boubaghla. He was probably a former lieutenant in the army of Emir Abdelkader, defeated for the last time by the French in 1847. Boubaghla refused to surrender at that battle, and retreated to Kabylia. From there he began a war against the French armies and their allies, often employing guerrilla tactics. Boubaghla was a relentless fighter, and very eloquent in Arabic. He was very religious, and some legends tell of his thaumaturgic skills.

Boubaghla went often to Soumer to talk with high-ranking members of the religious community, and Lalla Fadhma was soon attracted by his strong personality. At the same time, the relentless combatant was attracted by a woman so resolutely willing to contribute, by any means possible, to the war against the French. With her inspiring speeches, she convinced many men to fight as (volunteers ready to die as martyrs) and she herself, together with other women, participated in combat by providing cooking, medicines, and comfort to the fighting forces.

Traditional sources tell that a strong bond was formed between Lalla Fadhma and Boubaghla. She saw this as a wedding of peers, rather than the traditional submission as a slave to a husband. In fact, at that time Boubaghla left his first wife (Fatima Bent Sidi Aissa) and sent back to her owner a slave he had as a concubine (Halima Bent Messaoud). But on her side, Lalla Fadhma wasn&#x27;t free: even if she was recognized as (&quot;woman who left her husband to get back to his family ,&quot; a Kabylia institution), the matrimonial tie with her husband was still in place, and only her husband&#x27;s will could free her. However he did not agree to this, even when offered large bribes. The love between Fadhma and Bou remained platonic, but there were public expressions of this feeling between the two.

Fadhma was personally present at many fights in which Boubaghla was involved, particularly the battle of Tachekkirt won by Boubaghla forces (18–19 July 1854), where the French general Jacques Louis César Randon was caught but managed to escape later. On 26 December 1854, Boubaghla was killed; some sources claim it was due to treason of some of his allies. The resistance was left without a charismatic leader and a commander able to guide it efficiently. For this reason, during the first months of 1855, on a sanctuary built on top of the Azru Nethor peak, not far from the village where Fadhma was born, there was a great council among combatants and important figures of the tribes in Kabylie. They decided to grant Lalla Fadhma, assisted by her brothers, the command of combat.

===Resistance of Emir Abd al Qadir===

The French faced other opposition as well in the area. The superior of a religious brotherhood, Muhyi ad Din, who had spent time in Ottoman jails for opposing the bey&#x27;s rule, launched attacks against the French and their makhzen allies at Oran in 1832. In the same year, jihad was declared and to lead it tribal elders chose Muhyi ad Din&#x27;s son, twenty-five-year-old Abd al Qadir. Abd al Qadir, who was recognized as Amir al-Muminin (commander of the faithful), quickly gained the support of tribes throughout Algeria. A devout and austere marabout, he was also a cunning political leader and a resourceful warrior. From his capital in Tlemcen, Abd al Qadir set about building a territorial Muslim state based on the communities of the interior but drawing its strength from the tribes and religious brotherhoods. By 1839, he controlled more than two-thirds of Algeria. His government maintained an army and a bureaucracy, collected taxes, supported education, undertook public works, and established agricultural and manufacturing cooperatives to stimulate economic activity.

The French in Algiers viewed with concern the success of a Muslim government and the rapid growth of a viable territorial state that barred the extension of European settlement. Abd al Qadir fought running battles across Algeria with French forces, which included units of the Foreign Legion, organized in 1831 for Algerian service. Although his forces were defeated by the French under General Thomas Bugeaud in 1836, Abd al Qadir negotiated a favorable peace treaty the next year. The treaty of Tafna gained conditional recognition for Abd al Qadir&#x27;s regime by defining the territory under its control and salvaged his prestige among the tribes just as the shaykhs were about to desert him. To provoke new hostilities, the French deliberately broke the treaty in 1839 by occupying Constantine. Abd al Qadir took up the holy war again, destroyed the French settlements on the Mitidja Plain, and at one point advanced to the outskirts of Algiers itself. He struck where the French were weakest and retreated when they advanced against him in greater strength. The government moved from camp to camp with the amir and his army. Gradually, however, superior French resources and manpower and the defection of tribal chieftains took their toll. Reinforcements poured into Algeria after 1840 until Bugeaud had at his disposal 108,000 men, one-third of the French army.

One by one, the amir&#x27;s strongholds fell to the French, and many of his ablest commanders were killed or captured so that by 1843 the Muslim state had collapsed.
Abd al Qadir took refuge in 1841 with his ally, the sultan of Morocco, Abd ar Rahman II, and launched raids into Algeria. This alliance led the French Navy to bombard and briefly occupy Essaouira (Mogador) under the Prince de Joinville on August 16, 1844. A French force was destroyed at the Battle of Sidi-Brahim in 1845. However, Abd al Qadir was obliged to surrender to the commander of Oran Province, General Louis de Lamoricière, at the end of 1847.

Abd al Qadir was promised safe conduct to Egypt or Palestine if his followers laid down their arms and kept the peace. He accepted these conditions, but the minister of war — who years earlier as general in Algeria had been badly defeated by Abd al Qadir — had him consigned in France in the Château d&#x27;Amboise.

===Demography===



=== French atrocities against the Algerian indigenous population ===
According to Ben Kiernan, colonization and genocidal massacres proceeded in tandem. Within the first three decades (1830–1860) of French conquest, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Algerians, out of a total of 3 million, were killed due to war, massacres, disease and famine. Atrocities committed by the French during the Algerian War during the 1950s against Algerians include deliberate bombing and killing of unarmed civilians, rape, torture, executions through &quot;death flights&quot; or burial alive, thefts and pillaging. Up to 2 million Algerian civilians were also deported in internment camps.

During the Pacification of Algeria (1835-1903) French forces engaged in a scorched earth policy against the Algerian population. Colonel Lucien de Montagnac stated that the purpose of the pacification was to &quot;destroy everything that will not crawl beneath our feet like dogs&quot; The scorched earth policy, decided by Governor General Thomas Robert Bugeaud, had devastating effects on the socio-economic and food balances of the country: &quot;we fire little gunshot, we burn all douars, all villages, all huts; the enemy flees across taking his flock.&quot; According to Olivier Le Cour Grandmaison, the colonization of Algeria led to the extermination of a third of the population from multiple causes (massacres, deportations, famines or epidemics) that were all interrelated. Returning from an investigation trip to Algeria, Tocqueville wrote that &quot;we make war much more barbaric than the Arabs themselves [...] it is for their part that civilization is situated.&quot;

French forces deported and banished entire Algerian tribes. The Moorish families of Tlemcen were exiled to the Orient, and others were emigrated elsewhere. The tribes that were considered too troublesome were banned, and some took refuge in Tunisia, Morocco and Syria or were deported to New Caledonia or Guyana. Also, French forces also engaged in wholesale massacres of entire tribes. All 500 men, women and children of the El Oufia tribe were killed in one night, while all 500 to 700 members of the Ouled Rhia tribe were killed by suffocation in a cave. The Siege of Laghouat is referred by Algerians as the year of the &quot;Khalya ,&quot; Arabic for emptiness, which is commonly known to the inhabitants of Laghouat as the year that the city was emptied of its population. It is also commonly known as the year of Hessian sacks, referring to the way the captured surviving men and boys were put alive in the hessian sacks and thrown into dug-up trenches.
From 8 May to June 26, 1945, the French carried out the Sétif and Guelma massacre, in which between 6,000 and 80,000 Algerian Muslims were killed. Its initial outbreak occurred during a parade of about 5,000 people of the Muslim Algerian population of Sétif to celebrate the surrender of Nazi Germany in World War II; it ended in clashes between the marchers and the local French gendarmerie, when the latter tried to seize banners attacking colonial rule. After five days, the French colonial military and police suppressed the rebellion, and then carried out a series of reprisals against Muslim civilians. The army carried out summary executions of Muslim rural communities. Less accessible villages were bombed by French aircraft, and cruiser &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot;, standing off the coast in the Gulf of Bougie, shelled Kherrata. Vigilantes lynched prisoners taken from local jails or randomly shot Muslims not wearing white arm bands (as instructed by the army) out of hand. It is certain that the great majority of the Muslim victims had not been implicated in the original outbreak. The dead bodies in Guelma were buried in mass graves, but they were later dug up and burned in Héliopolis.

During the Algerian War (1954-1962), the French used deliberate illegal methods against the Algerians, including (as described by Henri Alleg, who himself had been tortured, and historians such as Raphaëlle Branche) beatings, torture by electroshock, waterboarding, burns, and rape. Prisoners were also locked up without food in small cells, buried alive, and thrown from helicopters to their death or into the sea with concrete on their feet. Claude Bourdet had denounced these acts on 6 December 1951, in the magazine &quot;L&#x27;Observateur&quot;, rhetorically asking, &quot;Is there a Gestapo in Algeria? .&quot;
D. Huf, in his seminal work on the subject, argued that the use of torture was one of the major factors in developing French opposition to the war. Huf argued, &quot;Such tactics sat uncomfortably with France&#x27;s revolutionary history, and brought unbearable comparisons with Nazi Germany. The French national psyche would not tolerate any parallels between their experiences of occupation and their colonial mastery of Algeria.&quot; General Paul Aussaresses admitted in 2000 that systematic torture techniques were used during the war and justified it. He also recognized the assassination of lawyer Ali Boumendjel and the head of the FLN in Algiers, Larbi Ben M&#x27;Hidi, which had been disguised as suicides. Bigeard, who called FLN activists &quot;savages ,&quot; claimed torture was a &quot;necessary evil .&quot; To the contrary, General Jacques Massu denounced it, following Aussaresses&#x27;s revelations and, before his death, pronounced himself in favor of an official condemnation of the use of torture during the war.
In June 2000, Bigeard declared that he was based in Sidi Ferruch, a torture center where Algerians were murdered. Bigeard qualified Louisette Ighilahriz&#x27;s revelations, published in the &quot;Le Monde&quot; newspaper on June 20, 2000, as &quot;lies.&quot; An ALN activist, Louisette Ighilahriz had been tortured by General Massu. However, since General Massu&#x27;s revelations, Bigeard has admitted the use of torture, although he denies having personally used it, and has declared, &quot;You are striking the heart of an 84-year-old man.&quot; Bigeard also recognized that Larbi Ben M&#x27;Hidi was assassinated and that his death was disguised as a suicide.

In 2018 France officially admitted that torture was systematic and routine.

In October 2021, the office of Algerian president Abdelmadjid Tebboune stated that 5.6 million Algerians died during French colonial rule.

===Hegemony of the ===

====Political organization====
A commission of inquiry established by the French Senate in 1892 and headed by former Prime Minister Jules Ferry, an advocate of colonial expansion, recommended that the government abandon a policy that assumed French law, without major modifications, could fit the needs of an area inhabited by close to two million Europeans and four million Muslims. Muslims had no representation in the French National Assembly before 1945 and were grossly under-represented on local councils. Because of the many restrictions imposed by the authorities, by 1915 only 50,000 Muslims were eligible to vote in elections in the civil communes. Attempts to implement even the most modest reforms were blocked or delayed by the local administration in Algeria, dominated by , and by the 27 representatives in the National Assembly (six deputies and three senators from each department).

Once elected to the National Assembly, became permanent fixtures. Because of their seniority, they exercised disproportionate influence, and their support was important to any government&#x27;s survival. The leader of the delegation, Auguste Warnier (1810–1875), succeeded during the 1870s in modifying or introducing legislation to facilitate the private transfer of land to settlers and continue the Algerian state&#x27;s appropriation of land from the local population and distribution to settlers. Consistent proponents of reform, like Georges Clemenceau and socialist Jean Jaurès, were rare in the National Assembly.

Napoleon III set up a Project of Arab kingdom in Algeria between 1860 and 1870. His goal was to take Algeria out of legal limbo and make it a kingdom associated with France before his project was abandoned by the Third Republic.

====Economic organization====

The bulk of Algeria&#x27;s wealth in manufacturing, mining, agriculture, and trade was controlled by the . The modern European-owned and -managed sector of the economy centered on small industry and a highly developed export trade, designed to provide food and raw materials to France in return for capital and consumer goods. Europeans held about 30% of the total arable land, including the bulk of the most fertile land and most of the areas under irrigation. By 1900, Europeans produced more than two-thirds of the value of output in agriculture and practically all agricultural exports. The modern, or European, sector was run on a commercial basis and meshed with the French market system that it supplied with wine, citrus, olives, and vegetables. Nearly half of the value of European-owned real property was in vineyards by 1914. By contrast, subsistence cereal production—supplemented by olive, fig, and date growing and stock raising—formed the basis of the traditional sector, but the land available for cropping was submarginal even for cereals under prevailing traditional cultivation practices.

In 1953, sixty per cent of the Muslim rural population were officially classed as being destitute. The European community, numbering at the time about one million out of a total population of nine million, owned about 66% of farmable land and produced all of the 1.3 million tons of wine that provided the base of the Algerian economy. Exports of Algerian wine and wheat to France were balanced in trading terms by a flow of manufactured goods.

The colonial regime imposed more and higher taxes on Muslims than on Europeans. The Muslims, in addition to paying traditional taxes dating from before the French conquest, also paid new taxes, from which the were normally exempted. In 1909, for instance, Muslims, who made up almost 90% of the population but produced 20% of Algeria&#x27;s income, paid 70% of direct taxes and 45% of the total taxes collected. And controlled how these revenues would be spent. As a result, towns had handsome municipal buildings, paved streets lined with trees, fountains and statues, while Algerian villages and rural areas benefited little if at all from tax revenues.

In financial terms Algeria was a drain on the French tax-payer. In the early 1950s the total Algerian budget of seventy-two billion francs included a direct subsidy of twenty-eight billion contributed from the metropolitan budget. Described at the time as being a French luxury, continued rule from Paris was justified on a variety of grounds including historic sentiment, strategic value and the political influence of the European settler population.

====Schools====

The colonial regime proved severely detrimental to overall education for Algerian Muslims, who had previously relied on religious schools to learn reading and writing and engage in religious studies. Not only did the state appropriate the habus lands (the religious foundations that constituted the main source of income for religious institutions, including schools) in 1843, but officials refused to allocate enough money to maintain schools and mosques properly and to provide for enough teachers and religious leaders for the growing population. In 1892, more than five times as much was spent for the education of Europeans as for Muslims, who had five times as many children of school age. Because few Muslim teachers were trained, Muslim schools were largely staffed by French teachers. Even a state-operated &quot;madrasah&quot; (school) often had French faculty members. Attempts to institute bilingual, bicultural schools, intended to bring Muslim and European children together in the classroom, were a conspicuous failure, rejected by both communities and phased out after 1870. According to one estimate, fewer than 5% of Algerian children attended any kind of school in 1870. As late as 1954 only one Muslim boy in five and one girl in sixteen was receiving formal schooling. The level of literacy amongst the total Muslim population was estimated at only 2% in urban areas and half of that figure in the rural hinterland.

Efforts were begun by 1890 to educate a small number of Muslims along with European students in the French school system as part of France&#x27;s &quot;civilizing mission&quot; in Algeria. The curriculum was entirely French and allowed no place for Arabic studies, which were deliberately downgraded even in Muslim schools. Within a generation, a class of well-educated, gallicized Muslims — the (literally, the evolved ones)—had been created. Almost all of the handful of Muslims who accepted French citizenship were ; ironically, this privileged group of Muslims, strongly influenced by French culture and political attitudes, developed a new Algerian self-consciousness.

====Relationships between the colons, Indigènes and France====
Reporting to the French Senate in 1894, Governor-General Jules Cambon wrote that Algeria had &quot;only a dust of people left her.&quot; He referred to the destruction of the traditional ruling class that had left Muslims without leaders and had deprived France of (literally, valid go-betweens), through whom to reach the masses of the people. He lamented that no genuine communication was possible between the two communities.

The who ran Algeria maintained a dialog only with the . Later they thwarted contact between the and Muslim traditionalists on the one hand and between and official circles in France on the other. They feared and mistrusted the Francophone , who were classified either as assimilationist, insisting on being accepted as Frenchmen but on their own terms, or as integrationists, eager to work as members of a distinct Muslim elite on equal terms with the French.

===Separate personal status===

Two communities existed: the French national and the people living with their own traditions.
Following its conquest of Ottoman-controlled Algeria in 1830, for well over a century, France maintained what was effectively colonial rule in the territory, though the French Constitution of 1848 made Algeria part of France, and Algeria was usually understood as such by French people, even on the Left.

Algeria became the prototype for a pattern of French colonial rule.

With nine million or so &#x27;Muslim&#x27; Algerians &quot;dominated&quot; by one million settlers, Algeria had similarities with South Africa, that has later been described as &quot;quasi-apartheid&quot; while the concept of apartheid was formalized in 1948.

This personal status lasted the entire time Algeria was French, from 1830 till 1962, with various changes in the meantime.

When French rule began, France had no well-established systems for intensive colonial governance, the main existing legal provision being the 1685 &quot;Code Noir&quot; which was related to slave-trading and owning and incompatible with the legal context of Algeria.

Indeed, France was committed in respecting the local law.

====Status before 1865====
On 5 July 1830, Hussein Dey, regent of Algiers, signed the act of capitulation to the Régence, which committed General de Bourmont and France &quot;not to infringe on the freedom of people of all classes and their religion .&quot; Muslims still remain submitted to the Muslim Customary law and Jews to the Law of Moses; all of them remained linked to the Ottoman Empire.

That same year and the same month, the July Revolution ended the Bourbon Restoration and began the July Monarchy in which Louis Philippe I was King of the French.

The royal &quot;Ordonnance du 22 juillet 1834&quot; organized general government and administration of the French territories in North Africa and is usually considered as an effective annexation of Algeria by France; the annexation made all people legally linked to France and broke the legal link between people and the Ottoman Empire, because International law made annexation systematically induce a régnicoles. This made people living in Algeria &quot;French subjects ,&quot; without providing them any way to become French nationals. However, since it was not positive law, this text did not introduce legal certainty on this topic.
This was confirmed by the French Constitution of 1848

As French rule in Algeria expanded, particularly under Thomas-Robert Bugeaud (1841–48), discriminatory governance became increasingly formalised. In 1844, Bugeaud formalised a system of European settlements along the coast, under civil government, with Arab/Berber areas in the interior under military governance. An important feature of French rule was &quot;cantonnement&quot;, whereby tribal land that was supposedly unused was seized by the state, which enabled French colonists to expand their landholdings, and pushed indigenous people onto more marginal land and made them more vulnerable to drought; this was extended under the governance of Bugeaud&#x27;s successor, Jacques Louis Randon.

A case in 1861 questioned the legal status of people in Algeria. On 28 November 1861, the &quot;conseil de l&#x27;ordre des avocats du barreau d&#x27;Alger&quot; (Bar association of Algiers) declined to recognise Élie Énos (or Aïnos), a Jew from Algiers, since only French citizens could become lawyers. On 24 February 1862 (&quot;appeal&quot;) and on 15 February 1864 &quot;(cassation)&quot;, judges reconsidered this, deciding that people could display the qualities of being French (without having access to the full rights of a French citizen).

====Status since 1865====

Napoleon III was the first elected president of the French Second Republic before becoming Emperor of the French by the 1852 French Second Empire referendum after the French coup d&#x27;état of 1851. In the 1860s, influenced by Ismael Urbain, he introduced what were intended as liberalizing reforms in Algeria, promoting the French colonial model of assimilation, whereby colonised peoples would eventually become French. His reforms were resisted by colonists in Algeria, and his attempts to allow Muslims to be elected to a putative new assembly in Paris failed.

However, he oversaw an 1865 decree (&quot;sénatus-consulte du 14 juillet 1865 sur l&#x27;état des personnes et la naturalisation en Algérie&quot;) that &quot;stipulated that all the colonised indigenous were under French jurisdiction, i.e., French nationals subjected to French laws ,&quot; and allowed Arab, Jewish, and Berber Algerians to request French citizenship—but only if they &quot;renounced their Muslim religion and culture .&quot;

This was the first time &quot;indigènes&quot; (natives) were allowed to access French citizenship, but such citizenship was incompatible with the &quot;statut personnel&quot;, which allowed them to live within the Muslim traditions.
* Flandin argued that French citizenship was not compatible with Muslim status, since it had opposing laws on marriage, repudiation, divorce, and children&#x27;s legal status.
* Claude Alphonse Delangle, senator, also argued that Muslim and Jewish religions allowed polygamy, repudiation, and divorce.

Later, Azzedine Haddour argued that this decree established &quot;the formal structures of a political apartheid .&quot; Since few people were willing to abandon their religious values (which was seen as apostasy), rather than promoting assimilation, the legislation had the opposite effect: by 1913, only 1,557 Muslims had been granted French citizenship.

Special penalties were managed by the &quot;cadis&quot; or tribe head but because this system was unfair it was decided by a Circulaire on 12 February 1844 to take control of those specific fines. Those fines were defined by various prefectural decrees, and were later known as the &quot;Code de l&#x27;indigénat.&quot; Lack of codification means that there is no complete text summary of these fines available.

On 28 July 1881, a new law (&quot;loi qui confère aux Administrateurs des communes mixtes en territoire civil la répression, par voie disciplinaire, des infractions spéciales à l&#x27;indigénat&quot;) known as the &quot;Code de l&#x27;indigénat&quot; was formally introduced for seven years to help administration. It enabled district officials to issue summary fines to Muslims without due legal process, and to extract special taxes.
This temporary law was renewed by other temporary laws: the laws of 27 June 1888 for two years, 25 June 1890, 25 June 1897, 21 December 1904, 24 December 1907, 5 July 1914, 4 August 1920, 11 July 1922 and 30 December 1922. By 1897, fines could be changed into forced labor.

Periodic attempts at partial reform failed:
* In 1881, Paul Leroy-Beaulieu created the &quot;Société française pour la protection des Indigènes des colonies (French society for the protection of natives)&quot; to give &quot;indigènes&quot; the right of vote.
* In 1887, Henri Michelin and Alfred Gaulier proposed the naturalisation of the &quot;indigènes&quot;, keeping the personal status from the local law but removing the personal status of common right from the Civil Code.
* In 1890, Alfred Martineau proposed a progressive French naturalisation of all Muslim &quot;indigènes&quot; living in Algeria.
* In 1911, &quot;La revue indigène&quot; published several articles signed by law professors (André Weiss, Arthur Giraud, Charles de Boeck and Eugène Audinet) advocating naturalization of the &quot;indigènes&quot; with their status.
* In 1912, the Jeunes Algériens movement claimed in its &quot;Manifeste&quot; that the naturalization with their status and with conditions of the Algerian &quot;indigènes&quot;.

In 1909, 70% of all direct taxes in Algeria were paid by Muslims, despite their general poverty.

Opportunities for Muslims improved slightly from the 1890s, particularly for urban elites, which helped ensure acquiescence to the introduction of military conscription for Muslims in 1911.

Napoléon III received a petition signed by more than 10,000 local Jews asking for collective access to French citizenship. This was also the desire, between 1865 and 1869, of the &quot;Conseils généraux des départements algériens&quot;. The Jews were the main part of the population that desired French citizenship.

Under the French Third Republic, on 24 October 1870, based on a project from the Second French Empire, Adolphe Crémieux, founder and president of the Alliance israélite universelle and minister of Justice of the Government of National Defense defined with Mac Mahon&#x27;s agreement a series of seven decrees related to Algeria, the most notable being number 136 known as the &quot;Crémieux Decree&quot; which granted French citizenship to Algerian indigenous Jews. A different decree, numbered 137, related to Muslims and foreigners and required 21 years of age to ask for French citizenship.

In 1870, the French government granted Algerian Jews French citizenship under the &quot;Crémieux Decree&quot;, but not Muslims. This meant that most Algerians were still &#x27;French subjects&#x27;, treated as the objects of French law, but were still not citizens, could still not vote, and were effectively without the right to citizenship.

In 1919, after the involvement of 172,019 Algerians in the First World War, the Jonnart Law eased access to French citizenship for those who met one of several criteria, such as working for the French army, a son in a war, knowing how to read and write in the French language, having a public position, being married to or born of an indigène who became a French citizen. Half a million Algerians were exempted from the &quot;indigénat&quot; status, and this status became void in 1927 in the mixed towns but remained applicable in other towns until its abrogation in 1944.

Later, Jewish people&#x27;s citizenship was revoked by the Vichy government in the early 1940s, but was restored in 1943.

====Muslim French====
Despite periodic attempts at partial reform, the situation of the &quot;Code de l&#x27;indigénat&quot; persisted until the French Fourth Republic, which formally began in 1946.

On 7 March 1944 &quot;ordonnance&quot; ended the &quot;Code de l&#x27;indigénat&quot; and created a second electoral college for 1,210,000 non-citizen Muslims and made 60,000 Muslims French citizen and with a vote in the first electoral college. The 17 August 1945 &quot;ordonnance&quot; gave each of the two colleges 15 MPs and 7 senators. On 7 May 1946, the &quot;Loi Lamine Guèye&quot; gave French citizenship to every overseas national, including Algerians, giving them a right to vote at 21 years old. The French Constitution of the Fourth Republic conceptualized the dissociation of citizenship and personal status (but no legal text implements this dissociation).

Although Muslim Algerians were accorded the rights of citizenship, the system of discrimination was maintained in more informal ways. Frederick Cooper writes that Muslim Algerians &quot;were still marginalized in their own territory, notably the separate voter roles of &quot;French&quot; civil status and of &quot;Muslim&quot; civil status, to keep their hands on power.&quot;

In the specific context following the second war, in 1947 is introduced the 1947 statute which granted a local status citizenship to the &quot;indigènes&quot; who became &quot;Muslim French&quot; (&quot;Français musulmans&quot;), while other French were &quot;Français non-musulmans&quot; remain civil status citizens The rights differences are no longer implied by a status difference, but by the difference between the two territories, Algerian and French.

This system is rejected by some European for introducing Muslims into the European college, and rejected by some Algerian nationalists for not giving full sovereignty to the Algerian nation.

This &quot;internal system of apartheid&quot; met with considerable resistance from the Muslims affected by it, and is cited as one of the causes of the 1954 insurrection.

====Algerian citizens====
On 18 March 1962, the Évian Accords guaranteed protection, non-discrimination and property rights for all Algerian citizens and the right of self-determination to Algeria. In France it was approved by the 1962 French Évian Accords referendum.

The agreement addressed various statuses:
* Algerian civil rights
* Rights and freedoms of Algerian citizens of ordinary civil status
* French nationals residing in Algeria as aliens.

The Évian Accords offered French nationals Algerian civil rights for three years, but required them to apply for Algerian nationality. The agreement stated that during this three-year period:

The European French community (the &quot;colon&quot; population), the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; and indigenous Sephardi Jews in Algeria were guaranteed religious freedom and property rights as well as French citizenship with the option to choose between French and Algerian citizenship after three years. Algerians were permitted to continue freely circulating between their country and France for work, although they would not have political rights equal to French citizens.

The OAS right-wing movement opposed this agreement.

==Government and administration==

===Initial settling of Algeria (1830–48)===

In November 1830, French colonial officials attempted to limit the arrivals at Algerian ports by requiring the presentation of passports and residence permits. The regulations created by the French government in May 1831 required permission from the Interior Ministry to enter Algeria and other French controlled territories.

By 1839, there were 25,000 Europeans living in Algeria, while only just less than half of these being French; the others being Spanish, Italian and Germans. And of these, the majority of them stayed within the coastal towns. These recent arrivals were mostly men, outnumbering women by five times. Of the minority that ventured into the countryside were soldier-settlers that were provided land concessions by the French government while Cistercian monks built monasteries and farms.

This allowed merchants with trading interests easy access to passports because they were not permanent settlers, and wealthy persons who planned to found agricultural enterprises in Algeria were also freely given access to move. The circular forbade passage to indigents and needy unskilled workers. During the 1840s, the French government assisted certain emigrants to Algeria, who were mostly urban workers from the Paris basin and France&#x27;s eastern frontier and were not the agricultural workers that the colonial officials wanted to be sent from France. Single men received 68 percent of the free passages and only 14 percent of the emigrants were women because of varying policies about the emigration of families that all favored unaccompanied males who were seen as more flexible and useful for laborious tasks. Initially in November 1840, families were eligible only if they had no small children and two-thirds of the family was able to work.

Later, in September 1841, only unaccompanied males could travel to Algeria for free and a complicated system for families was developed that made subsidized travel almost unavailable. These emigrants were offered many different forms of government assistance including free passage (both to the ports of France and by ship to Algeria), wine rations and food, land concessions, and were promised high wages. Between 1841 and 1845, about 20,000 individuals were offered this assisted emigration by the French government, though it is unknown exactly how many actually went to Algeria. These measures were funded and supported by the French government (both local and national) because they saw the move to Algeria as a solution to overpopulation and unemployment; those who applied for assisted emigration emphasized their work ethic, undeserved employment in France, a presumption of government obligation to the less fortunate. By 1848, Algeria was populated by 109,400 Europeans, only 42,274 of whom were French.

===Colonisation and military control===
A royal ordinance in 1845 called for three types of administration in Algeria. In areas where Europeans were a substantial part of the population, elected mayors and councils for self-governing &quot;full exercise&quot; communes (). In the &quot;mixed&quot; communes, where Muslims were a large majority, government was in the hands of appointed and some elected officials, including representatives of the (great chieftains) and a French administrator. The indigenous communes (), remote areas not adequately pacified, remained under the (rule of the sword).

By 1848 nearly all of northern Algeria was under French control. Important tools of the colonial administration, from this time until their elimination in the 1870s, were the (Arab Bureaus), staffed by Arabists whose function was to collect information on the indigenous people and to carry out administrative functions, nominally in cooperation with the army. The on occasion acted with sympathy to the local population and formed a buffer between Muslims and .

Under the , the had been permitted limited self-government in areas where European settlement was most intense, but there was constant friction between them and the army. The charged that the hindered the progress of colonization. They agitated against military rule, complaining that their legal rights were denied under the arbitrary controls imposed on the colony and insisting on a civil administration for Algeria fully integrated with metropolitan France. The army warned that the introduction of civilian government would invite Muslim retaliation and threaten the security of Algeria. The French government vacillated in its policy, yielding small concessions to the &quot;colon&quot; demands on the one hand while maintaining the &quot;régime du sabre&quot; to control the Muslim majority on the other.

===Under the French Second Republic and Second Empire (1848–70)===


Shortly after Louis Philippe&#x27;s constitutional monarchy was overthrown in the revolution of 1848, the new government of the Second Republic ended Algeria&#x27;s status as a colony and declared in the 1848 Constitution the occupied lands an integral part of France. Three civil territories — Alger, Oran, and Constantine — were organized as Departments of France (local administrative units) under a civilian government. This made them a part of France proper as opposed to a colony. For the first time, French citizens in the civil territories elected their own councils and mayors; Muslims had to be appointed, could not hold more than one-third of council seats, and could not serve as mayors or assistant mayors. The administration of territories outside the zones settled by colons remained under the French Army. Local Muslim administration was allowed to continue under the supervision of French Army commanders, charged with maintaining order in newly pacified regions, and the . Theoretically, these areas were closed to European colonization.

===Land and colonisers===

Even before the decision was made to annex Algeria, major changes had taken place. In a bargain-hunting frenzy to take over or buy at low prices all manner of property—homes, shops, farms and factories—Europeans poured into Algiers after it fell. French authorities took possession of the lands, from which Ottoman officials had derived income. Over time, as pressures increased to obtain more land for settlement by Europeans, the state seized more categories of land, particularly that used by tribes, religious foundations, and villages.

Called either (settlers), Algerians, or later, especially following the 1962 independence of Algeria, (literally, black feet), the European settlers were largely of peasant farmer or working-class origin from the poor southern areas of Italy, Spain, and France. Others were criminal and political deportees from France, transported under sentence in large numbers to Algeria. In the 1840s and 1850s, to encourage settlement in rural areas, official policy was to offer grants of land for a fee and a promise that improvements would be made. A distinction soon developed between the (great settlers) at one end of the scale, often self-made men who had accumulated large estates or built successful businesses, and smallholders and workers at the other end, whose lot was often not much better than that of their Muslim counterparts. According to historian John Ruedy, although by 1848 only 15,000 of the 109,000 European settlers were in rural areas, &quot;by systematically expropriating both pastoralists and farmers, rural colonization was the most important single factor in the destructuring of traditional society.&quot;

European migration, encouraged during the Second Republic, stimulated the civilian administration to open new land for settlement against the advice of the army. With the advent of the Second Empire in 1852, Napoleon III returned Algeria to military control. In 1858 a separate Ministry of Algerian Affairs was created to supervise administration of the country through a military governor general assisted by a civil minister.

Napoleon III visited Algeria twice in the early 1860s. He was profoundly impressed with the nobility and virtue of the tribal chieftains, who appealed to the emperor&#x27;s romantic nature, and was shocked by the self-serving attitude of the leaders. He decided to halt the expansion of European settlement beyond the coastal zone and to restrict contact between Muslims and the , whom he considered to have a corrupting influence on the indigenous population. He envisioned a grand design for preserving most of Algeria for the Muslims by founding a (Arab kingdom) with himself as the (king of the Arabs). He instituted the so-called politics of the to deal with the Muslims directly through their traditional leaders.

To further his plans for the , Napoleon III issued two decrees affecting tribal structure, land tenure, and the legal status of Muslims in French Algeria. The first, promulgated in 1863, was intended to renounce the state&#x27;s claims to tribal lands and eventually provide private plots to individuals in the tribes, thus dismantling &quot;feudal&quot; structures and protecting the lands from the . Tribal areas were to be identified, delimited into (administrative units), and given over to councils. Arable land was to be divided among members of the over a period of one to three generations, after which it could be bought and sold by the individual owners. Unfortunately for the tribes, however, the plans of Napoleon III quickly unraveled. French officials sympathetic to the colons took much of the tribal land they surveyed into the public domain. In addition, some tribal leaders immediately sold communal lands for quick gains. The process of converting arable land to individual ownership was accelerated to only a few years when laws were enacted in the 1870s stipulating that no sale of land by an individual Muslim could be invalidated by the claim that it was collectively owned. The cudah and other tribal officials, appointed by the French on the basis of their loyalty to France rather than the allegiance owed them by the tribe, lost their credibility as they were drawn into the European orbit, becoming known derisively as .

Napoleon III envisaged three distinct Algerias: a French colony, an Arab country, and a military camp, each with a distinct form of local government. The second decree, issued in 1865, was designed to recognize the differences in cultural background of the French and the Muslims. As French nationals, Muslims could serve on equal terms in the French armed forces and civil service and could migrate to France proper. They were also granted the protection of French law while retaining the right to adhere to Islamic law in litigation concerning their personal status. But if Muslims wished to become full citizens, they had to accept the full jurisdiction of the French legal code, including laws affecting marriage and inheritance, and reject the authority of the religious courts. In effect, this meant that a Muslim had to renounce some of the mores of his religion in order to become a French citizen. This condition was bitterly resented by Muslims, for whom the only road to political equality was perceived to be apostasy. Over the next century, fewer than 3,000 Muslims chose to cross the barrier and become French citizens. A similar status applied to the Jewish natives.

===Under the Third Republic (1870–1940)===

When the Prussians captured Napoleon III at the Battle of Sedan (1870), ending the Second Empire, demonstrations in Algiers by the led to the departure of the just-arrived new governor general and the replacement of the military administration by settler committees. Meanwhile, in France the government of the Third Republic directed one of its ministers, Adolphe Crémieux, &quot;to destroy the military regime ... [and] to completely assimilate Algeria into France.&quot; In October 1870, , whose concern with Algerian affairs dated from the time of the Second Republic, issued a series of decrees providing for representation of the Algerian départements in the National Assembly of France and confirming control over local administration. A civilian governor general was made responsible to the Ministry of Interior. The Crémieux Decrees also granted full French citizenship to Algerian Jews, who then numbered about 40,000. This act set them apart from Muslims, in whose eyes they were identified thereafter with the &quot;colons&quot;. The measure had to be enforced, however, over the objections of the &quot;colons&quot;, who made little distinction between Muslims and Jews. (Automatic citizenship was subsequently extended in 1889 to children of non-French Europeans born in Algeria unless they specifically rejected it.)

The loss of Alsace-Lorraine to Prussia in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War, led to pressure on the French government to make new land available in Algeria for about 5,000 Alsatian and Lorrainer refugees who were resettled there. During the 1870s, both the amount of European-owned land and the number of settlers were doubled, and tens of thousands of unskilled Muslims, who had been uprooted from their land, wandered into the cities or to colon farming areas in search of work.

====Comte and colonialism in the Third Republic====
====Kabylie insurrection====

The most serious native insurrection since the time of Abd al Qadir broke out in 1871 in Kabylia and spread through much of Algeria. The revolt was triggered by Crémieux&#x27;s extension of civil (that is, ) authority to previously self-governing tribal reserves and the abrogation of commitments made by the military government, but it had its basis in more long-standing grievances. Since the Crimean War (1854–56), the demand for grain had pushed the price of Algerian wheat up to European levels. Storage silos were emptied when the world market&#x27;s impact was felt in Algeria, and Muslim farmers sold their grain reserves — including seed grain — to speculators. But the community-owned silos were the fundamental adaptation of a subsistence economy to an unpredictable climate, and a good year&#x27;s surplus was stored away against a bad year&#x27;s dearth. When serious drought struck Algeria and grain crops failed in 1866 and for several years following, Muslim areas faced starvation, and with famine came pestilence. It was estimated that 20% of the Muslim population of Constantine died over a three-year period. In 1871 the civil authorities repudiated guarantees made to tribal chieftains by the previous military government for loans to replenish their seed supply. This act alienated even pro-French Muslim leaders, while it undercut their ability to control their people. It was against this background that the stricken Kabyles rose in revolt, following immediately on the mutiny in January 1871 of a squadron of Muslim spahis in the French Army who had been ordered to embark for France. The withdrawal of a large proportion of the army stationed in Algeria to serve in the Franco-Prussian War had weakened France&#x27;s control of the territory, while reports of defeats undermined French prestige amongst the indigenous population.

In the aftermath of the 1871 uprising, French authorities imposed stern measures to punish and control the entire Muslim population. France confiscated more than of tribal land and placed Kabylia under a (extraordinary rule), which denied due process guaranteed French nationals. A special (native code) listed as offenses acts such as insolence and unauthorized assembly not punishable by French law, and the normal jurisdiction of the cudah was sharply restricted. The governor general was empowered to jail suspects for up to five years without trial. The argument was made in defense of these exceptional measures that the French penal code as applied to Frenchmen was too permissive to control Muslims. Some were deported to New Caledonia, see Algerians of the Pacific.

====Conquest of the southwestern territories====

In the 1890s, the French administration and military called for the annexation of the Touat, the Gourara and the Tidikelt, a complex that during the period prior to 1890, was part of what was known as the Bled es-Siba (land of dissidence)), regions that were nominally Moroccan but which were not submitted to the authority of the central government.

An armed conflict opposed French 19th Corps&#x27; Oran and Algiers divisions to the Aït Khabbash, a faction of the Aït Ounbgui &quot;khams&quot; of the Aït Atta confederation. The conflict ended by the annexation of the Touat-Gourara-Tidikelt complex by France in 1901.

In the 1930s, the Saoura valley and the region of Tindouf were in turn annexed to French Algeria at the expense of Morocco, then under French protectorate since 1912. In 1938, the French government was given further control of military affairs in French Algeria following a decree from the President giving the Minister of the Interior Albert Sarraut control over Algeria.

====Conquest of the Sahara====

The French military expedition led by Lieutenant-Colonel Paul Flatters, was annihilated by Tuareg attack in 1881.

The French took advantage of long-standing animosity between Tuareg and Chaamba Arabs. The newly raised &quot;Compagnies Méharistes&quot; were originally recruited mainly from the Chaamba nomadic tribe. The &quot;Méhariste&quot; camel corps provided an effective means of policing the desert.

In 1902, Lieutenant penetrated Hoggar Mountains and defeated Ahaggar Tuareg in the battle of Tit.

===During World War II (1940–45)===
Colonial troops of French Algeria were sent to fight in metropolitan France during the Battle of France in 1940. After the Fall of France, the Third French Republic collapsed and was replaced by the Philippe Pétain&#x27;s French State, better known as Vichy France.

On 3 July 1940, the British Royal Navy attacked the French Navy&#x27;s fleet at Mers El Kébir, killing more than 1,200 men.

===Under the Fourth Republic (1946–58)===
Many Algerians had fought as French soldiers during the Second World War. Thus Algerian Muslims felt that it was even more unjust that their votes were not equal to those of the other Algerians, especially after 1947 when the Algerian Assembly was created. This assembly was composed of 120 members. Algerian Muslims, representing about 6.85 million people, could designate 50% of the Assembly members, while 1,150,000 non-Muslim Algerians could designate the other half. Moreover, a massacre occurred in Sétif on 8 May 1945. It opposed Algerians who were demonstrating for their national claim to the French Army. After skirmishes with police, Algerians killed about 100 French. The French army retaliated harshly, resulting in the deaths of approximately 6,000 to 45,000 Algerians. This triggered a radicalization of Algerian nationalists and could be considered the beginning of the Algerian War.

In 1956, about 512,000 French soldiers were in Algeria. No resolution was imaginable in the short term. An overwhelming majority of French politicians were opposed to the idea of independence while independence was gaining ground in Muslim Algerians&#x27; minds. France was deadlocked and the Fourth Republic collapsed over this dispute.

===Under the Fifth Republic (1958–62)===
In 1958, Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s return to power in response to a military coup in Algiers in May was supposed to keep Algeria&#x27;s status quo as departments of France as hinted by his speeches delivered in Oran and Mostaganem on 6 June 1958, in which he exclaimed (lit. &quot;Long live French Algeria!&quot;). De Gaulle&#x27;s republican constitution project was approved through the September 1958 referendum and the Fifth Republic was established the following month with de Gaulle as its president.

The latter consented to independence in 1962 after a referendum on Algerian self-determination in January 1961 and despite a subsequent aborted military coup in Algiers led by four French generals in April 1961.

==Post-colonial relations==

Relations between post-colonial Algeria and France have remained close throughout the years, although sometimes difficult. In 1962, the Évian Accords peace treaty provided land in the Sahara for the French Army, which it had used under de Gaulle to carry out its first nuclear tests (&quot;Gerboise Bleue&quot;). Many European settlers () living in Algeria and Algerian Jews, who unlike Algerian Muslims had been granted French citizenship by the Crémieux decrees at the end of the 19th century, were expelled to France where they formed a new community. On the other hand, the issue of the , the Muslims who had fought on the French side during the war, still remained unresolved. Large numbers of were killed in 1962, during the immediate aftermath of the Algerian War, while those who escaped with their families to France have tended to remain an unassimilated refugee community. The present Algerian government continues to refuse to allow and their descendants to return to Algeria.

On 23 February 2005, the French law on colonialism was an act passed by the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) conservative majority, which imposed on high-school (lycée) teachers to teach the &quot;positive values&quot; of colonialism to their students, in particular in North Africa (article 4). The law created a public uproar and opposition from the whole of the left-wing, and was finally repealed by President Jacques Chirac (UMP) at the beginning of 2006, after accusations of historical revisionism from various teachers and historians.

There were fears that the French law on colonialism would hinder confronting the dark side of French rule in Algeria because article four of the law decreed among other things that &quot;School programmes are to recognise in particular the positive role of the French presence overseas, especially in North Africa.&quot; Benjamin Stora, a leading specialist on French Algerian history of colonialism and a pied-noir himself, said &quot;France has never taken on its colonial history. It is a big difference with the Anglo-Saxon countries, where post-colonial studies are now in all the universities. We are phenomenally behind the times.&quot; In his opinion, although the historical facts were known to academics, they were not well known by the French public, and this led to a lack of honesty in France over French colonial treatment of the Algerian people.

In 2017, President Emmanuel Macron described France&#x27;s colonization of Algeria as a &quot;crime against humanity .&quot; He also said: &quot;It&#x27;s truly barbarous and it&#x27;s part of a past that we need to confront by apologizing to those against whom we committed these acts.&quot; Polls following his remarks reflected a decrease in his support.

In July 2020, the remains of 24 Algerian resistance fighters and leaders, who were decapitated by the French colonial forces in the 19th century and whose skulls were taken to Paris as war trophies and held in the Musee de l&#x27;Homme in Paris, were repatriated to Algeria and buried in the Martyrs&#x27; Square at El Alia Cemetery.

In January 2021, Macron stated there would be &quot;no repentance nor apologies&quot; for the French colonization of Algeria, colonial abuses or French involvement during the Algerian independence war. Instead efforts would be devoted toward reconciliation.
 was a slogan used about 1960 by those French people who wanted to keep Algeria ruled by France. Literally &quot;French Algeria&quot;, it means that the three of Algeria were to be considered integral parts of France. By integral parts, it is meant that they have their deputies (representatives) in the French National Assembly, and so on. Further, the people of Algeria who were to be permitted to vote for the deputies would be those who universally accepted French law, rather than sharia (which was used in personal cases among Algerian Muslims under laws dating back to Napoleon III), and such people were predominantly of French origin or Jewish origin. Many who used this slogan were returnees.

In Paris, during the perennial traffic jams, adherence to the slogan was indicated by sounding a car horn in the form of four telegraphic dots followed by a dash, as &quot; .&quot; Whole choruses of such horn soundings were heard. This was intended to be reminiscent of the Second World War slogan, &quot;V for Victory&quot;, which had been three dots followed by a dash. The intention was that the opponents of were to be considered as traitorous as the collaborators with Germany during the Occupation of France.

<text>Flavone is an organic compound with the formula . A white solid, flavone is a derivative of chromone with a phenyl (Ph) substituent adjacent to the ether group. The compound is of little direct practical importance, but substituted derivatives, the flavones and flavonoids are a large class of nutritionally important natural products. Flavone can be prepared in the laboratory by cyclization of 2-hydroxacetophenone. Isomeric with flavone is isoflavone, where the phenyl group is adjacent to the ketone.

<text>Flavan-3-ols (sometimes referred to as flavanols) are a subgroup of flavonoids. They are derivatives of flavans that possess a 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2&quot;H&quot;-chromen-3-ol skeleton. Flavan-3-ols are structurally diverse and include a range of compounds, such as catechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, proanthocyanidins, theaflavins, thearubigins. They play a part in plant defense and are present in the majority of plants.

== Chemical structure ==

The single-molecule (monomer) catechin, or isomer epicatechin (see diagram), adds four hydroxyls to flavan-3-ol, making building blocks for concatenated polymers (proanthocyanidins) and higher order polymers (anthocyanidins).

Flavan-3-ols possess two chiral carbons, meaning four diastereoisomers occur for each of them. They are distinguished from the yellow, ketone-containing flavonoids such as quercitin and rutin, which are called flavonols. Early use of the term bioflavonoid was imprecisely applied to include the flavanols, which are distinguished by absence of ketone(s). Catechin monomers, dimers, and trimers (oligomers) are colorless. Higher order polymers, anthocyanidins, exhibit deepening reds and become tannins.

Catechin and epicatechin are epimers, with (–)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin being the most common optical isomers found in nature. Catechin was first isolated from the plant extract catechu, from which it derives its name. Heating catechin past its point of decomposition releases pyrocatechol (also called catechol), which explains the common origin of the names of these compounds.

Epigallocatechin and gallocatechin contain an additional phenolic hydroxyl group when compared to epicatechin and catechin, respectively, similar to the difference in pyrogallol compared to pyrocatechol.

Catechin gallates are gallic acid esters of the catechins; an example is epigallocatechin gallate, which is commonly the most abundant catechin in tea. Proanthocyanidins and thearubigins are oligomeric flavan-3-ols.

In contrast to many other flavonoids, flavan-3-ols do not generally exist as glycosides in plants.
=== Biosynthesis of (–)-epicatechin ===

The flavonoids are products from a cinnamoyl-CoA starter unit, with chain extension using three molecules of malonyl-CoA. Reactions are catalyzed by a type III PKS enzyme. These enzyme do not use ACPSs, but instead employ coenzyme A esters and have a single active site to perform the necessary series of reactions, e.g. chain extension, condensation, and cyclization. Chain extension of 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA with three molecules of malonyl-CoA gives initially a polyketide (Figure 1), which can be folded. These allow Claisen-like reactions to occur, generating aromatic rings. Fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) can be used to detect flavanols in plant cells.

=== Aglycones ===
== Dietary sources ==
Flavan-3-ols are abundant in teas derived from the tea plant &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;, as well as in some cocoas (made from the seeds of &quot;Theobroma cacao&quot;), although the content is affected considerably by processing, especially in chocolate. Flavan-3-ols are also present in the human diet in fruits, in particular pome fruits, berries, vegetables, and wine. Their content in food is variable and affected by various factors, such as cultivar, processing, and preparation.

== Bioavailability and metabolism==

The bioavailability of flavan-3-ols depends on the food matrix, type of compound and their stereochemical configuration. While monomeric flavan-3-ols are readily taken up, oligomeric forms are not absorbed. Most data for human metabolism of flavan-3-ols are available for monomeric compounds, especially epiatechin. These compounds are taken up and metabolized upon uptake in the jejunum, mainly by &quot;O&quot;-methylation and glucuronidation, and then further metabolized by the liver. The colonic microbiome has also an important role in the metabolism of flavan-3-ols and they are catabolized to smaller compounds such as 5-(3′/4′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactones and hippuric acid. Only flavan-3-ols with an intact (epi)catechin moiety can be metabolized into 5-(3′/4′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactones (image in Gallery).

==Possible adverse effects==
As catechins in green tea extract can be hepatotoxic, Health Canada and EFSA have advised for caution, recommending intake should not exceed 800 mg per day. 

==Research==

Research has shown that flavan-3-ols may affect vascular function, blood pressure, and blood lipids, with only minor effects demonstrated, as of 2019. In 2015, the European Commission approved a health claim for cocoa solids containing 200 mg of flavanols, stating that such intake &quot;may contribute to maintenance of vascular elasticity and normal blood flow&quot;. As of 2022, food-based evidence indicates that intake of 400–600 mg per day of flavan-3-ols could have a small positive effect on cardiovascular biomarkers.

<text>Anthocyanidins are common plant pigments, the aglycones of anthocyanins. They are based on the flavylium cation, an oxonium ion, with various groups substituted for its hydrogen atoms. They generally change color from red through purple, blue, and bluish green as a function of pH.

Anthocyanidins are an important subclass of the polymethine dyes and flavonoids. The flavylium cation is a chromenylium cation with a phenyl group substituted in position 2; and chromenylium (also called benzopyrylium) is a bicyclic version of pyrylium. The positive charge can move around the molecule.

At least 31 monomeric anthocyanidins have been properly identified in living organisms, mostly as the core components of anthocyanins. The latter are responsible for the red, purple, blue, or black color of many fruits (like grapes and blueberries), flowers (like roses), leaves (like purple cabbage), and even tubers (like radishes and purple yams). They are also found in some animals.

== Classification ==
3-Deoxyanthocyanidins such as luteolinidin are a class of anthocyanidins lacking an hydroxyl group on carbon 3.

== Natural occurrence ==

Most plant anthocyanins are based on cyanidin (30%), delphinidin (22%), and pelargonidin (18%), respectively. Altogether 20% of the anthocyanins are based on the three common anthocyanidins (peonidin, malvidin, and petunidin) that are methylated.

Around 3%, 3%, and 2% of the anthocyanins or anthocyanidins are respectively labeled as 3-desoxyanthocyanidins, rare methylated anthocyanidins, and 6-hydroxyanthocyanidins, respectively.

In bryophytes, anthocyanins are usually based on 3-desoxyanthocyanidins located in the cell wall. A new anthocyanidin, riccionidin A, has been isolated from the liverwort &quot;Ricciocarpos natans&quot;. It could be derived from 6,7,2′,4′,6′-pentahydroxyflavylium, having undergone ring closure of the 6’ -hydroxyl at the 3-position. Its visible spectrum in methanolic HCl is at 494 nm. This pigment was accompanied by riccionidin B, which most probably is based on two molecules of riccionidin A linked via the 3′- or 5′-positions. Both pigments were also detected in the liverworts &quot;Marchantia polymorpha&quot;, &quot;Riccia duplex&quot;, and &quot;Scapania undulata&quot;.

== Effect of pH ==
The stability of anthocyanidins is dependent on pH. At a low pH (acidic conditions), colored anthocyanidins are present, whereas at a higher pH (basic conditions) the colorless chalcones forms are present.

<text>CC, for &quot;&quot; or &quot;Carbon Copy&quot; (December 22, 2001 – March 3, 2020), was a brown tabby and white domestic shorthair and the first cloned pet. She was cloned by scientists at Texas A&amp;M University in conjunction with Genetic Savings &amp; Clone Inc. CC&#x27;s surrogate mother was a tabby, but her genetic donor, Rainbow, was a calico domestic longhair. The difference in hair coloration between CC and Rainbow is due to X-inactivation and epigenetic re-programming, which normally occurs in a fertilized embryo before implantation.

In December 2006, CC gave birth to four kittens. The litter was fathered naturally by another lab cat named Smokey. It included two males named Tim and Zip and one female named Tess. Another kitten (a female) was stillborn. This incident was the first time a cloned pet gave birth. Throughout her life, CC appeared to be free of the cloning-related health problems that have arisen in some other animal clones. &quot;CC has always been a perfectly normal cat and her kittens are just that way, too,&quot; according to Shirley Kraemer, CC&#x27;s owner. &quot;We&#x27;ve been monitoring their health and all of them are fine, just like CC has been for the past five years.&quot;

On March 3, 2020, CC died at 18 years old in College Station, Texas.
