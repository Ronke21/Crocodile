<text>Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Marquise of Montespan (5 October 1640 – 27 May 1707), commonly known as Madame de Montespan (), was a French noblewoman and the most celebrated royal mistress of King Louis XIV. During their romantic relationship, which lasted from the late 1660s to the late 1670s, she was sometimes referred to by contemporaries as the &quot;true Queen of France&quot;due to the pervasiveness of her influence at court.

Born into the House of Rochechouart, one of the oldest noble families of France, Françoise-Athénaïs married the Marquis of Montespan in 1663. She then became a maid of honour to Princess Henrietta, Duchess of Orléans, and later a lady-in-waiting to Queen Maria Theresa. Noted for her great beauty and wit, she carefully cultivated a relationship with Louis XIV and eventually supplanted Louise de La Vallière as his favourite. She had seven children by the king, six of them later legitimised but only four survived infancy .

Madame de Montespan&#x27;s alleged involvement in the Affair of the Poisons, which began in 1677, severely damaged her reputation and resulted in her fall from royal favour. In 1691, she withdrew to the convent of Filles de Saint-Joseph in Paris, but left thirteen years later when she relocated to the Château d&#x27;Oiron. She devoted the rest of her life to charity, patronage and penance until her death in 1707 at the age of 66. She is an ancestress of several royal houses in Europe, including those of Spain, Italy, Bulgaria, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg.

==Early life==
Françoise-Athénaïs was born in October 1640 and was baptised on 5 October 1640 at the Château of Lussac-les-Châteaux, today&#x27;s Vienne department, in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region in France. Françoise (as a &quot;précieuse&quot;, she later adopted the name &quot;Athénaïs&quot;), or more formally, Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, possessed the blood of two of the oldest noble families of France through her parents, Gabriel de Rochechouart, the Duke of Mortemart and the Prince of Tonnay-Charente, and Diane de Grandseigne, a lady-in-waiting to Anne of Austria, queen consort of France.

From her father, she inherited the famous Mortemart &quot;esprit&quot; (&quot;wit&quot;). As a young girl, she often travelled with her mother between the family estates and the court at the Louvre in Paris. At the age of 12, she began her formal education at the Convent of St Mary at Saintes, where her sister Gabrielle had started hers almost a decade earlier. She was very religious and took Communion once a week, a practice that she would continue as a young woman.

At the age of 20, Françoise-Athénaïs became a maid-of-honour to the king&#x27;s sister-in-law, Princess Henrietta, Duchess of Orléans, who was known at court by the traditional honorific of &quot;Madame&quot;. Later, because of the relationship between her mother and the queen dowager, Anne of Austria, Françoise-Athénaïs was appointed to be a lady-in-waiting to the king&#x27;s wife, Maria Theresa of Spain.

===Marriage===
On 28 January 1663, Françoise-Athénaïs married Louis Henri de Pardaillan de Gondrin, Marquis of Montespan, who was one year her junior. Madame de La Fayette says in her &quot;Histoire de madame Henriette d&#x27;Angleterre&quot; that Françoise-Athénaïs was in love with another young man, Louis de La Trémoille, who was the elder son and heir to the Duc de Noirmoutier (one of the leaders of the Fronde). However, La Trémoille had to flee to Spain after a disastrous duel, and Françoise-Athénaïs was betrothed to Montespan. The wedding ceremony took place in a chapel at the Église Saint-Eustache, Paris. Françoise later recounted that as she had neglected to bring along the proper kneeling cushions for the ceremony, the couple had to kneel on dog cushions. She soon became pregnant with her first child, Christine. Two weeks after her daughter&#x27;s birth she danced in a Court Ballet, and less than a year later her second child was born.

The couple lived in a small house close to the Louvre, which allowed Madame de Montespan to attend court and carry out her duties there as a lady-in-waiting to the Duchess of Orléans. She quickly established herself as the &quot;reigning beauty of the court&quot;. Beauty, however, was only one of Madame de Montespan&#x27;s many charms. She was a cultured and amusing conversationalist, who won the admiration of such literary figures as letter-writer Madame de Sévigné and diarist Saint-Simon. In addition, she kept abreast of political events. This had the effect of making her even more appealing to men of intellect and power. She was courted by a number of suitors including Louis de Buade de Frontenac and Charles Auguste de la Fare.

==Rise as &quot;Maîtresse-en-titre&quot;==

Madame de Montespan astounded the court by openly resenting the position of Queen Maria Theresa of Spain. The daughter of King Philip IV of Spain and Elisabeth de France, the Queen&#x27;s Spanish title, before her marriage, was &quot;Infanta María Teresa de Austria&quot;. In France, she was known as &quot;Marie-Thérèse d&#x27;Autriche&quot;. A scandal arose when the Duchess of Montausier, Governess of the Children of France and lady-in-waiting to the Queen, was accused of acting as a go-between in order to secure the governorship of the Dauphin for her husband, the Duke of Montausier.

By 1666, Madame de Montespan was trying to take the place of Louis XIV&#x27;s current mistress, Louise de La Vallière. Using her wit and charm, she sought to ingratiate herself with the king. She also became close to the Dauphin, whose affection for her never wavered. Even though Louise de La Vallière knew that Montespan was trying to conquer the King&#x27;s heart and reportedly laughed at her miserable efforts, she definitely underestimated her new rival. Montespan cleverly cultivated friendships with both Louise and Queen Maria Theresa and when both ladies were pregnant, Madame de Montespan was asked to help them entertain the King during private dinners. Soon they regretted their decision, for Montespan now cultivated an intimate relationship with the King. Madame de Montespan was also said to have seduced the King by dropping her towel obligingly when she spotted Louis spying on her while she showered. Shortly after, Louise&#x27;s position was diminished to second place. To conceal his new relationship, the King placed the ladies in connected rooms so he could have access to both. Louise left court and joined a convent perhaps through regret and religiosity or because she had no other option. The spotlight belonged now to the twenty-five-year-old Athénaïs de Montespan.

She also became friends at court with another lady-in-waiting to the queen, Louise Boyer, the wife of Anne Jules de Noailles. Montespan&#x27;s youngest son, the Count of Toulouse, would later marry one of Boyer&#x27;s granddaughters.

===Illegitimate children===

The first of Madame de Montespan&#x27;s seven children with the king was born in 1669. The newborn child, a girl, is thought to have been named Louise-Françoise. The upbringing of this first child (and subsequent children) was entrusted to one of Madame de Montespan&#x27;s friends, Madame Scarron (the future &quot;marquise de Maintenon&quot;). A son, Louis-Auguste, was born in 1670. When the third child, Louis-César, was born in 1672, a house was purchased for Scarron and the children on the Rue Vaugirard.

In 1673, the couple&#x27;s three living illegitimate children were legitimised by Louis XIV and given the royal surname of &quot;de Bourbon&quot;. The eldest, a son, Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, became the &quot;duc du Maine&quot;; the second child, a son, Louis-César de Bourbon, became the &quot;comte de Vexin&quot;; and the third, a daughter, Louise-Françoise de Bourbon, became &quot;Mademoiselle de Nantes&quot; and, in 1685, married the son of the head of the House of Condé, a cadet branch of the reigning House of Bourbon. As Madame de Montespan spent most of her time immersed in the social whirl of the court, the three had little contact with their busy mother and spent most of their childhood with their governess, Madame Scarron.

In 1674, an official separation with her husband was declared by the &quot;Procureur général&quot; Achille de Harlay, assisted by six judges at the Châtelet.

Due to her role in royal adultery, the Roman Catholic Church soon became her adversary. In 1675, the priest Lécuyer refused to give her absolution, which was necessary for her to take Easter communion, a requisite for all Catholics. Father Lécuyer raged,

The King appealed to the priest&#x27;s superiors, but the Church refused to yield to the king&#x27;s demands. After a short separation, the King and Madame de Montespan resumed their relationship, resulting in the birth of two more children, Françoise Marie de Bourbon, &quot;Mademoiselle de Blois&quot;, in 1677, and Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, &quot;comte de Toulouse&quot;, in 1678. Both were to be legitimised in 1681.
==Royal scandal and fall==

===&quot;Affaire des Poisons&quot;===

The &quot;Affaire des Poisons&quot;, which erupted in September 1677, was to be the beginning of the end of the reign of &quot;La Montespan&quot;. Suspicion that Madame de Montespan might be capable of murder or worse began when the King&#x27;s eye strayed to another beauty, the Duchess of Fontanges. Madame de Montespan&#x27;s relegation to the position of superintendent of the Queen&#x27;s household as a result brought matters to a head. Before any further developments in her romance with the King could occur, Mlle de Fontanges died in 1681. Many at the time suspected that she had been poisoned by her rival, although none could prove it. It is now believed that Mlle de Fontanges died from natural causes.

Long assumed to have been involved in the infamous &quot;Affaire des Poisons&quot;, Madame de Montespan has never been conclusively implicated. Gabriel Nicolas de La Reynie, Paris&#x27; first Lieutenant General of Police and the chief judge of the court, before whom the famous poisoning cases were brought, heard testimony that placed Madame de Montespan&#x27;s first visits to the so-called witch Catherine Monvoisin, known as La Voisin, in 1665. In 1666, Madame de Montespan supposedly went so far as to allow a priest, Étienne Guibourg, to perform a black mass over her nude body in a blood-soaked ceremony, which also, allegedly, included infant sacrifice. Whatever the truth in these allegations, in July 1667, Madame de Montespan became the king&#x27;s new mistress even though Louise de La Vallière was carrying his child, Louis de Bourbon, &quot;comte de Vermandois&quot;.

In addition to seeking Louis&#x27; love, some charged Madame de Montespan with also conspiring to kill him, but inconsistencies in this testimony suggest that the royal mistress was innocent of these charges. However, suspicion was thrown onto Madame de Montespan because the name of her maid, Mlle Desœillets, was frequently mentioned in connection with &quot;La Voisin&quot; in the evidence brought before the &quot;Chambre Ardente&quot;.

Indeed, if anyone was attempting to kill the king, it was more likely Claude de Vin des Œillets, who had an illegitimate child fathered but not publicly acknowledged by Louis. Presumably, the maid resented the loss of Louis&#x27; attention.
Olympia Mancini, Countess of Soissons, herself a former mistress of the king and well-known intrigante, was also implicated in the conspiracy.

From the end of 1680 onwards, Louvois, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, and Madame de Maintenon all helped to hush up the affair in order to prevent further scandal about the mother of the king&#x27;s legitimised children. Concerning the king&#x27;s need to avoid shocking scandal, Police Chief La Reynie said:
===Exile===

In 1691, no longer in royal favour, Madame de Montespan retired to the &quot;Filles de Saint-Joseph&quot; convent, in the &quot;rue Saint-Dominique&quot; in Paris, with a pension of half a million francs. In gratitude for her departure, the king made her brother the duc de Vivonne, a marshal of France. Louis had previously made one of her sisters, Gabrielle, whose vows were only four years old, the abbess of the wealthy Fontevraud Abbey. Gabrielle was appointed abbess in 1670 and it is said that her beauty, wit, and knowledge surpassed Athénaïs&#x27; qualities. The King wanted her to stay for longer periods at court but Gabrielle always declined and stayed only for very short times.

In 1700, Madame de Montespan acquired the Château d&#x27;Oiron, thereby abandoning the hospice of Fontevraud from 1703 and moved there in 1704 after the death of her sister Gabrielle.
In her long retirement, Madame de Montespan donated vast sums to hospitals and charities. She was also a generous patron of the arts and letters and befriended Corneille, Racine, and La Fontaine.

===Death===
The last years of Madame de Montespan&#x27;s life were given up to a very severe penance. Real sorrow over her death was felt by her three youngest children. She died on 27 May 1707 at the age of almost sixty-seven while taking the waters at Bourbon-l&#x27;Archambault in order to try to heal an illness. The king forbade her children to wear mourning for her. 

==Appearance and personality==
Athénaïs was considered &quot;astonishingly beautiful&quot; by the standards of her time. She had large blue eyes, long, thick, corn-coloured hair that fell in curls about her shoulders, and a curvaceous, voluptuous body. She was droll, amusing and used her considerable wit to mock others.

She also had an extravagant and demanding nature and possessed enough charm to get what she wanted. She was expensive and glorious, like the Palace of Versailles itself. Her apartments were filled with pet animals and thousands of flowers and she had a private gallery. Costly jewels were showered upon her and she was highly discriminating regarding the quality of the gems, returning them if they did not meet her exacting standards. She was given the nickname &quot;Quanto&quot; (&quot;How much&quot;, in Italian). Her love for food and her numerous pregnancies caused her to gain weight in her late thirties.

==Legacy==

===Château de Clagny===

The Château de Clagny in Versailles was built between 1674 and 1680 from the drawings of Jules Hardouin-Mansart, &quot;Premier architecte du Roi&quot;, (First architect of the King), on land bought by Louis XIV in 1665. Madame de Sévigné wrote that its construction employed 1,200 workers and the cost was no less than 2 million livres. The royal gardener André Le Nôtre created the gardens, which looked west toward the much larger palace of Versailles, of which Clagny was a smaller version. The Château de Clagny was also famed for its gallery. In 1685, Louis XIV gave the magnificent palace to Madame de Montespan. At her death, her oldest son, the &quot;duc du Maine&quot;, inherited Clagny and, in turn, passed it on to his son, Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, &quot;prince de Dombes&quot;. The château reverted to the French crown in 1766 and was demolished in 1769.

===Trianon de porcelaine===

Louis XIV also had a pleasure pavilion, called the Trianon de Porcelaine near Versailles, purchased and built for Madame de Montespan, surrounded by gardens, on the site of the former hamlet of Trianon. It was meant as a hideaway for the couple. Because of the fragility of the earthenware tiles used in its construction, the &quot;Trianon de porcelaine&quot; was demolished in 1687 and replaced by the Grand Trianon of pink marble (&quot;marbre rose des Pyrénées&quot;).

== Children by Louis XIV ==
 

== In popular culture ==
In the 1979 comedy movie &quot;Love at First Bite&quot;, Dracula&#x27;s servant Renfield mentions one of his master&#x27;s past loves, the Countess de Montespan.

In the 2000 film, Vatel (film), Madame de Montespan is portrayed by Marine Delterme.

<text>Catherine Monvoisin, or Montvoisin, née &quot;Deshayes&quot;, known as &quot;La Voisin&quot; (c. 1640 – 22 February 1680), was a French fortune teller, commissioned poisoner, and professional provider of alleged sorcery. She was the head of a network of fortune tellers in Paris providing poison, aphrodisiacs, abortion, purported magical services and the arranging of black masses, with clients among the aristocracy and became the central figure in the famous &quot;affaire des poisons&quot;. Her purported organization of commissioned black magic and poison murder was suspected to have killed 1,000 people, but it is believed that upwards of 2,500 people might have been murdered.

==Life==
Little is known of Catherine Deshayes&#x27; early life. She learned fortune telling as a child and later married Antoine Monvoisin, who was active as a jeweller and silk merchant with a shop at Pont-Marie in Paris.

When her husband&#x27;s trade business led to bankruptcy, La Voisin supported the family by practising chiromancy and face-reading. In addition to being a fortune teller, she was also active as a midwife, which developed into providing abortions. Her business as a fortune teller gradually developed into manufacturing and selling purported magical objects and potions, arranging black masses and selling aphrodisiacs and poison to profit from her clients&#x27; wishes upon their future.

From the late 1660s, La Voisin had become a wealthy and famous fortune teller with clients among the highest aristocracy of France. Among her clients were Olympia Mancini, comtesse de Soissons; Marie Anne Mancini, duchess de Bouillon; Elizabeth, comtesse de Gramont, and François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg.

She resided at Villeneuve-sur-Gravois, where she received her clients all day, and entertained the Parisian upper-class society at parties with violin music in her garden at night. La Voisin regularly attended service at the church of the Jansenist abbé de Sant-Amour, principal of the Paris University, and the godmother of her daughter was the noblewoman Mme de la Roche-Guyon.

She supported a family of six, including her husband, her mother and her children. She was known to have at least six lovers: the executioner Andre Guillaume, Monsieur Latour, vicomte de Cousserans, the count de Labatie, the alchemist Blessis, the architect Fauchet and the magician Adam Lesage. At one point, Adam Lesage tried to induce her to kill her husband, but while he was initially successful, she changed her mind and aborted the process.

La Voisin was interested in science and alchemy and financed several private projects and enterprises, some of them concocted by con artists who tried to swindle her. She was known to suffer from alcoholism, was apparently abused by Latour, and engaged in several conflicts with her rival, the poisoner Marie Bosse.

===Abortion provider===

La Voisin apparently started to include abortions, illegal at the time, for-profit within her services as a midwife, and her clients eventually included wealthy members of the aristocracy. She had a network of abortion providers working for her, notably Catherine Lepère, who stated that she received her clients from La Voisin, who referred clients to her and took the majority of the profit as a fee.

Marie Bosse claimed that fetuses, who had been aborted late in the pregnancy, were burned in a furnace at the house of La Voisin and buried in the garden of her house. However, as Louis XIV gave the order that the part of La Voisin&#x27;s enterprise which had to do with abortions should not be pursued further, this part of her business is the least investigated and unknown one, and the claims of Marie Bosse therefore remain unconfirmed.

===Fortune telling===

La Voisin later said that as a fortune teller, she had merely used and developed what God had given her. She stated that she was taught the art of fortune telling at the age of nine, and that after her husband became ruined, she decided to profit by it.

She developed her art by studying the modern methods of physiology, and the art of reading the client&#x27;s future by studying their face and hands.

She spent a great deal of money in order to provide an atmosphere which would make her clients more inclined to believe her prophecies: for example, she had a special robe of crimson red velvet embroidered with eagles in gold made for a price of 1,500 livres to perform in.

In 1665 or 1666, her divination was questioned by the Congregation of the Mission at the Saint Vincent de Paul&#x27;s order and she was called for questioning, but La Voisin defended herself successfully before the professors at Sorbonne University and was allowed to continue her business as a fortune teller.

===Professional sorcery===

Her business as a fortune teller gradually developed into a business of professional alleged black magic. During her activity as a fortune teller, she noticed similarities among her clients&#x27; wishes about their future: almost all wanted to have someone fall in love with them, that someone would die so that they might inherit, or that their spouses would die so that they might marry someone else.

La Voisin decided to profit financially from her clients&#x27; wishes by offering services of purported magic to make their wishes come true. Initially, she told her clients that their wish would come true if it was also the will of God. Secondly, she started to recommend to her clients some actions that would make their dreams come true. These actions were initially to visit the church of some particular saint; then she started to sell amulets, and gradually, she recommended more and more alleged magical objects or rituals of various kinds.

For those clients who wished for someone to fall in love with them, she manufactured love powders: the bones of toads, the teeth of moles, Spanish fly, iron filings, human blood and &quot;mummy&quot;, and the dust of human remains were among the alleged ingredients of the love powders concocted by La Voisin.

Finally, her most radical and expensive recommended practices were the black mass, which she arranged for clients for profit, during which the client could pray to Satan for their wish to come true. During some of these masses, a woman performed as an altar, upon which a bowl was placed: a baby was held above the bowl, and the blood from it was poured into the bowl. Whether the baby in question was actually killed on this occasion, or whether the baby was already dead by natural causes, such as being stillborn, could vary.

She had several associates working for her arranging and participating in her professional magic services, notably Adam Lesage, who performed alleged magical tasks; and the priest Étienne Guibourg and abbé Mariotte, who officiated at the black masses.

===Poison commission===

La Voisin finally took the step from purported magical potions, amulets and rituals, to selling aphrodisiacs to those who wished for someone to fall in love with them, and fatal poison was given to those who wished for someone to die.

The art of poisoning had become a regular science at the time, having been perfected, in part, by Giulia Tofana, a professional female poisoner in Italy, only a few decades before La Voisin. La Voisin provided a large variety of poisons for her clients and had a network of poison providers working for her, notably the apothecary Catherine Trianon.

===Connection to Madame de Montespan===
The most important client of La Voisin was Madame de Montespan, the official royal mistress to King Louis XIV of France. Their contact was often performed through the companion of Montespan, Claude de Vin des Œillets. Montespan was alleged to have hired La Voisin in 1667 to arrange a black mass. This mass was celebrated in a house in Rue de la Tannerie. Adam Lesage and abbé Mariotte officiated, while Montespan prayed to win the love of the king. The same year, Montespan became the official mistress of the King, and after this, she employed La Voisin whenever a problem occurred in her relationship with the King.

In 1673, when the King&#x27;s interest in Montespan seemed to wane, Montespan again employed La Voisin, who provided a series of black masses officiated by Étienne Guibourg. On at least one occasion, Montespan herself acted as the human altar during the mass. La Voisin also provided Montespan with an aphrodisiac, with which Montespan drugged the King. During the King&#x27;s affair with Madame de Soubise, Montespan used an aphrodisiac provided by Voisin&#x27;s colleague Françoise Filastre and made by Louis Galet in Normandy.

In 1677, Montespan made it clear that if the King should abandon her, she would have him killed. When the King entered into a relationship with Angélique de Fontanges in 1679, Montespan called for La Voisin and asked her to have both the King and Fontanges killed. La Voisin hesitated but was eventually convinced to agree. At the house of her colleague, Catherine Trianon, La Voisin constructed a plan to kill the King together with the poisoners Trianon, Bertrand and Romani, the last being the fiancé of her daughter. Trianon was unwilling to participate and tried to make her change her mind by constructing an ill-fated fortune for her, but Voisin refused to change her mind. The group decided to murder the King by poisoning a petition, to be delivered to his own hands.

On 5 March 1679, La Voisin visited the royal court in Saint-Germain to deliver the petition. That day, however, there were too many petitioners and the King did not take their petitions, which foiled her plan. Upon her return to her home in Paris, she was castigated by a group of monks. She handed the petition to her daughter Marguerite Montvoisin and asked her to burn it, which she also did. The next day, she made plans to visit Catherine Trianon after mass, to plan the next murder attempt upon Louis XIV.

=== Arrest ===

The death of the King&#x27;s sister-in-law, the duchesse d&#x27;Orléans, had been falsely attributed to poison, and the crimes of Madame de Brinvilliers (executed in 1676) and her accomplices were still fresh in the public mind. In parallel, a riot took place where people accused witches of abducting children for the black masses, and priests reported that a growing number of people were confessing to poisoning in their confessions.

In 1677, the fortune teller Magdelaine de La Grange was arrested for poisoning, and claimed that she had information about crimes of high importance. The arrest of the successful fortune teller and poisoner Marie Bosse and Marie Vigoreaux in January 1679 made the police aware that there existed a network of fortune tellers in Paris who dealt in the distribution of poison.

On 12 March 1679, La Voisin was arrested outside Notre-Dame de Bonne-Nouvelle after having heard mass, just before her meeting with Catherine Trianon. In April 1679, a commission appointed to inquire into the subject and to prosecute the offenders met for the first time. Its proceedings, including some suppressed in the official records, are preserved in the notes of one of the official court reporters, Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie.

===Investigation and trial===

At the arrest of La Voisin, her maid Margot stated that the arrest would mean the end of a number of people at all levels of society. La Voisin was imprisoned at Vincennes, where she was subjected to questioning. On 27 December 1679, Louis XIV issued an order that the whole network should be exterminated by all methods regardless of rank, sex, or age. The arrest of La Voisin was followed by the arrest of her daughter Marguerite Monvoisin, Guibourg, Lesage, Bertrand, Romani and the rest of her network of associates.

La Voisin was never subjected to torture: although a formal order was issued permitting the use of torture, it was made clear that the order was not to be put in effect, and consequently, it was never made use of. The reason is suggested to have been the fear that she might reveal the names of influential people if she was questioned under torture. Aware of her alcoholism, however, her interrogators reportedly did not limit her access to alcohol but instead kept her in a state of drunkenness during her interrogations. Her confrontations with other accused, particularly those with Adam Lesage and Marie Bosse, was especially effective. Initially, she claimed to have referred all those clients wishing to buy poison to Marie Bosse. In March, however, she named Marguerite Leféron and Francoise de Dreux as clients, and on 10 October, she admitted having sold poison and magical services to several members of the royal court; she also described the development of her career.

La Voisin denied ever meeting or serving Montespan. She did admit that &quot;Paris is full of this kind of thing and there is an infinite number of people engaged in this evil trade&quot; but refused to mention further clients nor did she mention having arranged or participated in black masses. She once mentioned to the guards that the question she feared most was that they would ask her about her visits to the royal court. It is likely that she was referring to Montespan as her client and her attempt at murdering the King, and that she feared that such a confession should result in her execution for regicide. Her list of clients, the arranging of the black masses, her connection to Montespan and the murder attempt on the King were not revealed until after her death, when it was stated by her daughter and confirmed by the testimonies of her former associates.

She also denied claims of using her oven to burn the bones of aborted infants that were too large for the grave area in her garden. She also counterclaimed any usage of poisons and that she only possessed purgatives for personal use or for her family. Another accusation she denied includes injecting syringes with fatal liquids into the bodies of pregnant women to &quot;empty&quot; them, after which the aborted foetuses were subsequently buried in the same manner at the garden grave.

===Trial and execution===
On 17 February 1680, La Voisin was put on trial, and was convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to execution by burning two days later. In the days following her verdict until her execution, she was formally interrogated under torture, and the official document stated that she was tortured enough to beg for mercy. However, while an official permit for torture was issued, the police were given to understand that the permit was not to be used, and Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie stated that La Voisin was in reality never subjected to torture. Madame de Sevigne, who observed La Voisin shortly before her execution, described her as being able to move so freely and so seemingly healthy that it did not seem possible for her to have been subjected to torture. These final interrogations did not reveal anything new.

La Voisin was executed in public on the Place de Grève in Paris on 22 February 1680. On her way to her execution, she reportedly pushed away the priest, and when fastened on the stake, she desperately pushed away the hay which was piled up around her.

In July, her daughter Marguerite Monvoisin revealed her connection to Montespan, which was confirmed by the statements of the other accused. This caused the monarch to eventually close the investigation, seal the testimonies and place the remaining accused outside of the public justice system by imprisoning them under a lettre de cachet.

<text>In mathematics, specifically differential calculus, the inverse function theorem gives a sufficient condition for a function to be invertible in a neighborhood of a point in its domain: namely, that its &quot;derivative is continuous and non-zero at the point&quot;. The theorem also gives a formula for the derivative of the inverse function.
In multivariable calculus, this theorem can be generalized to any continuously differentiable, vector-valued function whose Jacobian determinant is nonzero at a point in its domain, giving a formula for the Jacobian matrix of the inverse. There are also versions of the inverse function theorem for holomorphic functions, for differentiable maps between manifolds, for differentiable functions between Banach spaces, and so forth.

The theorem was first established by Picard and Goursat using an iterative scheme: the basic idea is to prove a fixed point theorem using the contraction mapping theorem.

==Statements==
For functions of a single variable, the theorem states that if formula_1 is a continuously differentiable function with nonzero derivative at the point formula_2; then formula_1 is injective (or bijective onto the image) in a neighborhood of formula_2, the inverse is continuously differentiable near formula_5, and the derivative of the inverse function at formula_6 is the reciprocal of the derivative of formula_1 at formula_2:
formula_9

It can happen that a function formula_1 may be injective near a point formula_2 while formula_12. An example is formula_13. In fact, for such a function, the inverse cannot be differentiable at formula_14, since if formula_15 were differentiable at formula_6, then, by the chain rule, formula_17, which implies formula_18. (The situation is different for holomorphic functions; see #Holomorphic inverse function theorem below.)

For functions of more than one variable, the theorem states that if formula_1 is a continuously differentiable function from an open subset formula_20 of formula_21 into formula_22, and the derivative formula_23 is invertible at a point (that is, the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of at is non-zero), then there exist neighborhoods formula_24 of formula_2 in formula_20 and formula_27 of formula_14 such that formula_29 and formula_30 is bijective. Writing formula_31, this means that the system of equations formula_32 has a unique solution for formula_33 in terms of formula_34 when formula_35. Note that the theorem &quot;does not&quot; say formula_1 is bijective onto the image where formula_37 is invertible but that it is locally bijective where formula_37 is invertible.

Moreover, the theorem says that the inverse function formula_39 is continuously differentiable, and its derivative at formula_5 is the inverse map of formula_23; i.e.,
:formula_42
In other words, if formula_43 are the Jacobian matrices representing formula_44, this means:
:formula_45
The hard part of the theorem is the existence and differentiability of formula_15. Assuming this, the inverse derivative formula follows from the chain rule applied to formula_47. (Indeed, formula_48) Since taking the inverse is infinitely differentiable, the formula for the derivative of the inverse shows that if formula_1 is continuously formula_50 times differentiable, with invertible derivative at the point , then the inverse is also continuously formula_50 times differentiable. Here formula_50 is a positive integer or formula_53.

There are two variants of the inverse function theorem. Given a continuously differentiable map formula_54, the first is
*The derivative formula_23 is surjective (i.e., the Jacobian matrix representing it has rank formula_56) if and only if there exists a continuously differentiable function formula_57 on a neighborhood formula_27 of formula_14 such that formula_60 near formula_6,
and the second is
*The derivative formula_23 is injective if and only if there exists a continuously differentiable function formula_57 on a neighborhood formula_27 of formula_14 such that formula_66 near formula_2.

In the first case (when formula_23 is surjective), the point formula_14 is called a regular value. Since formula_70, the first case is equivalent to saying formula_14 is not in the image of critical points formula_2 (a critical point is a point formula_2 such that the kernel of formula_23 is nonzero). The statement in the first case is a special case of the submersion theorem.

These variants are restatements of the inverse functions theorem. Indeed, in the first case when formula_23 is surjective, we can find an (injective) linear map formula_76 such that formula_77. Define formula_78 so that we have:
:formula_79
Thus, by the inverse function theorem, formula_80 has inverse near formula_81; i.e., formula_82 near formula_6. The second case (formula_23 is injective) is seen in the similar way.

==Example==
Consider the vector-valued function formula_85 defined by:
:formula_86
The Jacobian matrix of it at formula_87 is:
:formula_88
with the determinant:
:formula_89

The determinant formula_90 is nonzero everywhere. Thus the theorem guarantees that, for every point in formula_91, there exists a neighborhood about over which is invertible. This does not mean is invertible over its entire domain: in this case is not even injective since it is periodic: formula_92.

== Counter-example ==

If one drops the assumption that the derivative is continuous, the function no longer need be invertible. For example formula_93 and formula_94 has discontinuous derivative
formula_95 and formula_96, which vanishes arbitrarily close to formula_97. These critical points are local max/min points of formula_1, so formula_1 is not one-to-one (and not invertible) on any interval containing formula_97. Intuitively, the slope formula_101 does not propagate to nearby points, where the slopes are governed by a weak but rapid oscillation.

==Methods of proof==
As an important result, the inverse function theorem has been given numerous proofs. The proof most commonly seen in textbooks relies on the contraction mapping principle, also known as the Banach fixed-point theorem (which can also be used as the key step in the proof of existence and uniqueness of solutions to ordinary differential equations).

Since the fixed point theorem applies in infinite-dimensional (Banach space) settings, this proof generalizes immediately to the infinite-dimensional version of the inverse function theorem (see Generalizations below).

An alternate proof in finite dimensions hinges on the extreme value theorem for functions on a compact set. This approach has an advantage that the proof generalizes to a situation where there is no Cauchy completeness (see ).

Yet another proof uses Newton&#x27;s method, which has the advantage of providing an effective version of the theorem: bounds on the derivative of the function imply an estimate of the size of the neighborhood on which the function is invertible.

=== Proof for single-variable functions ===
We want to prove the following: &quot;Let formula_102 be an open set with formula_103 a continuously differentiable function defined on formula_104, and suppose that formula_105. Then there exists an open interval formula_106 with formula_107 such that formula_1 maps formula_106 bijectively onto the open interval formula_110, and such that the inverse function formula_111 is continuously differentiable, and for any formula_112, if formula_113 is such that formula_114, then formula_115.&quot; 

We may without loss of generality assume that formula_116. Given that formula_104 is an open set and formula_37 is continuous at formula_119, there exists formula_120 such that formula_121 andformula_122 

In particular,formula_123

This shows that formula_1 is strictly increasing for all formula_125. Let formula_126 be such that formula_127. Then formula_128. By the intermediate value theorem, we find that formula_1 maps the interval formula_130 bijectively onto formula_131. Denote by formula_132 and formula_133. Then formula_134 is a bijection and the inverse formula_135 exists. The fact that formula_135 is differentiable follows from the differentiability of formula_1. In particular, the result follows from the fact that if formula_138 is a strictly monotonic and continuous function that is differentiable at formula_107 with formula_105, then formula_141 is differentiable with formula_142, where formula_143 (a standard result in analysis). This completes the proof.

=== A proof using successive approximation ===

To prove existence, it can be assumed after an affine transformation that formula_144 and formula_145, so that formula_146.

By the mean value theorem for vector-valued functions, for a differentiable function formula_147, formula_148. Setting formula_149, it follows that

:formula_150

Now choose formula_151 so that formula_152 for formula_153. Suppose that formula_154 and define formula_155 inductively by formula_156 and formula_157. The assumptions show that if formula_158 then

:formula_159.

In particular formula_160 implies formula_161. In the inductive scheme formula_162
and formula_163. Thus formula_164 is a Cauchy sequence tending to formula_165. By construction formula_166 as required.

To check that formula_167 is C1, write formula_168 so that
formula_169. By the inequalities above, formula_170 so that formula_171.
On the other hand if formula_172, then formula_173. Using the geometric series for formula_174, it follows that formula_175. But then

:formula_176

tends to 0 as formula_50 and formula_178 tend to 0, proving that formula_57 is C1 with formula_180.

The proof above is presented for a finite-dimensional space, but applies equally well for Banach spaces. If an invertible function formula_1 is Ck with formula_182, then so too is its inverse. This follows by induction using the fact that the map formula_183 on operators is Ck for any formula_50 (in the finite-dimensional case this is an elementary fact because the inverse of a matrix is given as the adjugate matrix divided by its determinant).
 The method of proof here can be found in the books of Henri Cartan, Jean Dieudonné, Serge Lang, Roger Godement and Lars Hörmander.

=== A proof using the contraction mapping principle ===
Here is a proof based on the contraction mapping theorem. Specifically, following T. Tao, it uses the following consequence of the contraction mapping theorem.

Basically, the lemma says that a small perturbation of the identity map by a contraction map is injective and preserves a ball in some sense. Assuming the lemma for a moment, we prove the theorem first. As in the above proof, it is enough to prove the special case when formula_185 and formula_186. Let formula_187. The mean value inequality applied to formula_188 says:
:formula_189
Since formula_190 and formula_191 is continuous, we can find an formula_120 such that
:formula_193
for all formula_194 in formula_195. Then the early lemma says that formula_196 is injective on formula_195 and formula_198. Then
:formula_199
is bijective and thus has an inverse. Next, we show the inverse formula_15 is continuously differentiable (this part of the argument is the same as that in the previous proof). This time, let formula_201 denote the inverse of formula_1 and formula_203. For formula_204, we write formula_205 or formula_206. Now, by the early estimate, we have
:formula_207
and so formula_208. Writing formula_209 for the operator norm,
:formula_210
As formula_211, we have formula_212 and formula_213 is bounded. Hence, formula_57 is differentiable at formula_215 with the derivative formula_216. Also, formula_191 is the same as the composition formula_218 where formula_219; so formula_191 is continuous.

It remains to show the lemma. First, we have:
:formula_221
which is to say
:formula_222
This proves the first part. Next, we show formula_223. The idea is to note that this is equivalent to, given a point formula_215 in formula_225, find a fixed point of the map
:formula_226
where formula_227 such that formula_228 and the bar means a closed ball. To find a fixed point, we use the contraction mapping theorem and checking that formula_229 is a well-defined strict-contraction mapping is straightforward. Finally, we have: formula_230 since
:formula_231

As might be clear, this proof is not substantially different from the previous one, as the proof of the contraction mapping theorem is by successive approximation.

== Applications ==
===Implicit function theorem===
The inverse function theorem can be used to solve a system of equations
:formula_232
i.e., expressing formula_34 as functions of formula_234, provided the Jacobian matrix is invertible. The implicit function theorem allows to solve a more general system of equations:
:formula_235
for formula_215 in terms of formula_165. Though more general, the theorem is actually a consequence of the inverse function theorem. First, the precise statement of the implicit function theorem is as follows:
*given a map formula_238, if formula_239, formula_1 is continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of formula_241 and the derivative of formula_242 at formula_6 is invertible, then there exists a differentiable map formula_244 for some neighborhoods formula_245 of formula_246 such that formula_247. Moreover, if formula_248, then formula_249; i.e., formula_250 is a unique solution.
To see this, consider the map formula_251. By the inverse function theorem, formula_252 has the inverse formula_253 for some neighborhoods formula_254. We then have:
:formula_255
implying formula_256 and formula_257 Thus formula_258 has the required property. formula_259

===Giving a manifold structure===
In differential geometry, the inverse function theorem is used to show that the pre-image of a regular value under a smooth map is a manifold. Indeed, let formula_260 be such a smooth map from an open subset of formula_21 (since the result is local, there is no loss of generality with considering such a map). Fix a point formula_2 in formula_263 and then, by permuting the coordinates on formula_21, assume the matrix formula_265 has rank formula_266. Then the map formula_267 is such that formula_268 has rank formula_269. Hence, by the inverse function theorem, we find the smooth inverse formula_253 of formula_229 defined in a neighborhood formula_272 of formula_273. We then have
:formula_274
which implies
:formula_275
That is, after the change of coordinates by formula_253, formula_1 is a coordinate projection (this fact is known as the submersion theorem). Moreover, since formula_278 is bijective, the map
:formula_279
is bijective with the smooth inverse. That is to say, formula_57 gives a local parametrization of formula_263 around formula_2. Hence, formula_263 is a manifold. formula_259 (Note the proof is quite similar to the proof of the implicit function theorem and, in fact, the implicit function theorem can be also used instead.)

More generally, the theorem shows that if a smooth map formula_285 is transversal to a submanifold formula_286, then the pre-image formula_287 is a submanifold.

== Global version ==
The inverse function theorem is a local result; it applies to each point. &quot;A priori&quot;, the theorem thus only shows the function formula_1 is locally bijective (or locally diffeomorphic of some class). The next topological lemma can be used to upgrade local injectivity to injectivity that is global to some extent.

Proof: First assume formula_289 is compact. If the conclusion of the theorem is false, we can find two sequences formula_290 such that formula_291 and formula_292 each converge to some points formula_194 in formula_20. Since formula_1 is injective on formula_20, formula_297. Now, if formula_298 is large enough, formula_292 are in a neighborhood of formula_297 where formula_1 is injective; thus, formula_302, a contradiction.

In general, consider the set formula_303. It is disjoint from formula_304 for any subset formula_305 where formula_1 is injective. Let formula_307 be an increasing sequence of compact subsets with union formula_289 and with formula_309 contained in the interior of formula_310. Then, by the first part of the proof, for each formula_298, we can find a neighborhood formula_312 of formula_313 such that formula_314. Then formula_315 has the required property. formula_259 (See also for an alternative approach.)

The lemma implies the following (a sort of) global version of the inverse function theorem:

Note that if formula_20 is a point, then the above is the usual inverse function theorem.

== Holomorphic inverse function theorem ==
There is a version of the inverse function theorem for holomorphic maps.

The theorem follows from the usual inverse function theorem. Indeed, let formula_318 denote the Jacobian matrix of formula_1 in variables formula_292 and formula_321 for that in formula_322. Then we have formula_323, which is nonzero by assumption. Hence, by the usual inverse function theorem, formula_1 is injective near formula_81 with continuously differentiable inverse. By chain rule, with formula_326,
:formula_327
where the left-hand side and the first term on the right vanish since formula_328 and formula_329 are holomorphic. Thus, formula_330 for each formula_50. formula_259

Similarly, there is the implicit function theorem for holomorphic functions.

As already noted earlier, it can happen that an injective smooth function has the inverse that is not smooth (e.g., formula_333 in a real variable). This is not the case for holomorphic functions because of:
== Formulations for manifolds ==
The inverse function theorem can be rephrased in terms of differentiable maps between differentiable manifolds. In this context the theorem states that for a differentiable map formula_334 (of class formula_335), if the differential of formula_229,
:formula_337
is a linear isomorphism at a point formula_338 in formula_339 then there exists an open neighborhood formula_24 of formula_338 such that
:formula_342

is a diffeomorphism. Note that this implies that the connected components of and containing &quot;p&quot; and &quot;F&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) have the same dimension, as is already directly implied from the assumption that &quot;dF&quot;&quot;p&quot; is an isomorphism.
If the derivative of is an isomorphism at all points in then the map is a local diffeomorphism.

==Generalizations==

===Banach spaces===
The inverse function theorem can also be generalized to differentiable maps between Banach spaces &#x27; and &#x27;. Let &#x27; be an open neighbourhood of the origin in &#x27; and formula_343 a continuously differentiable function, and assume that the Fréchet derivative formula_344 of &#x27; at 0 is a bounded linear isomorphism of &#x27; onto &#x27;. Then there exists an open neighbourhood &#x27; of formula_345 in &#x27; and a continuously differentiable map formula_346 such that formula_347 for all &#x27; in &#x27;. Moreover, formula_348 is the only sufficiently small solution &#x27; of the equation formula_349.

There is also the inverse function theorem for Banach manifolds.

===Constant rank theorem===
The inverse function theorem (and the implicit function theorem) can be seen as a special case of the constant rank theorem, which states that a smooth map with constant rank near a point can be put in a particular normal form near that point. Specifically, if formula_350 has constant rank near a point formula_351, then there are open neighborhoods of and of formula_352 and there are diffeomorphisms formula_353 and formula_354 such that formula_355 and such that the derivative formula_356 is equal to formula_357. That is, &quot;looks like&quot; its derivative near . The set of points formula_358 such that the rank is constant in a neighborhood of formula_338 is an open dense subset of ; this is a consequence of semicontinuity of the rank function. Thus the constant rank theorem applies to a generic point of the domain.

When the derivative of is injective (resp. surjective) at a point , it is also injective (resp. surjective) in a neighborhood of , and hence the rank of is constant on that neighborhood, and the constant rank theorem applies.

===Polynomial functions===
If it is true, the Jacobian conjecture would be a variant of the inverse function theorem for polynomials. It states that if a vector-valued polynomial function has a Jacobian determinant that is an invertible polynomial (that is a nonzero constant), then it has an inverse that is also a polynomial function. It is unknown whether this is true or false, even in the case of two variables. This is a major open problem in the theory of polynomials.

===Selections===
When formula_360 with formula_361, formula_1 is formula_50 times continuously differentiable, and the Jacobian formula_364 at a point formula_365 is of rank formula_56, the inverse of formula_1 may not be unique. However, there exists a local selection function formula_368 such that formula_369 for all formula_215 in a neighborhood of formula_371, formula_372, formula_368 is formula_50 times continuously differentiable in this neighborhood, and formula_375 (formula_376 is the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of formula_20).

=== Over a real closed field ===
The inverse function theorem also holds over a real closed field &quot;k&quot; (or an O-minimal structure). Precisely, the theorem holds for a semialgebraic (or definable) map between open subsets of formula_378 that is continuously differentiable.

The usual proof of the IFT uses Banach&#x27;s fixed point theorem, which relies on the Cauchy completeness. That part of the argument is replaced by the use of the extreme value theorem, which does not need completeness. Explicitly, in , the Cauchy completeness is used only to establish the inclusion formula_198. Here, we shall directly show formula_380 instead (which is enough). Given a point formula_215 in formula_382, consider the function formula_383 defined on a neighborhood of formula_384. If formula_385, then formula_386 and so formula_114, since formula_388 is invertible. Now, by the extreme value theorem, formula_389 admits a minimal at some point formula_119 on the closed ball formula_384, which can be shown to lie in formula_195 using formula_393. Since formula_394, formula_395, which proves the claimed inclusion. formula_259

Alternatively, one can deduce the theorem from the one over real numbers by Tarski&#x27;s principle.

<text>Maprotiline, sold under the brand name Ludiomil among others, is a tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) that is used in the treatment of depression. It may alternatively be classified as a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), specifically a secondary amine. In terms of its chemistry and pharmacology, maprotiline is closely related to such-other secondary-amine TCAs as nortriptyline and protriptyline and has similar effects to them, albeit with more distinct anxiolytic effects. Additionally, whereas protriptyline tends to be somewhat more stimulating and in any case is distinctly more-or-less non-sedating, mild degrees of sedation may be experienced with maprotiline.

==Medical uses==
Maprotiline is used in the treatment of depression, such as depression associated with agitation or anxiety and has similar efficacy to the antidepressant drug moclobemide. This finding has also been validated by a group of general practitioners who compared the respective efficacy and tolerability of maprotiline and moclobemide.
* Treatment of depression of all forms and severities (endogenous, psychotic, involutional, and neurotic), especially depression associated with agitation or anxiety
* Panic disorder
* Neuropathic pain, including painful polyneuropathy in diabetics and non-diabetics alike.
* Treatment of the depressive phase of bipolar affective disorder
* For the symptomatic relief of anxiety, tension or insomnia

The use of maprotiline in the treatment of enuresis in pediatric patients has so far not been systematically explored and its use is not recommended. Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population in general have not been established. Anyone considering the use of maprotiline in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.

A very small body of research has also explored the potential of maprotiline in treating diabetic kidney disease and it has been measured against amitriptyline in this regard.

Maprotiline and fluoxetine have also been found, among certain lines of research, to have quite potent anti-profilerative effects against certain forms of cancer of the Burkitt lymphoma type. One study also bore ought a certain level of evidence regarding maprotiline’s ability to suppress both cholesterol biosynthesis and hepatocellular carcinoma liver-cancer progression.

Maprotiline was also measured against imipramine, fluoxetine and ketamine in an experiment-model involving two different kinds of chicken differently-conditioned against stress, including (black) Australorps in the proposed treatment of treatment-resistant depression in humans.

In general, lower dosages are recommended for patients over 60 years of age. Dosages of 50 mg to 75 mg daily are usually satisfactory as maintenance therapy for elderly patients who do not tolerate higher amounts. In any case, 225 m.g./d. is the absolute-maximum highest recommended dose for this drug, as any more can predispose more significantly to seizures. 150 m.g. is the average optimal daily dose for otherwise-healthy patients who can tolerate a full dose.

===Available forms===
* Coated tablets: 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg
* Injectable concentrate, 25 mg

==Contraindications==
In generalised theory, maprotiline (as with other tricyclic antidepressants, besides trimipramine and possibly clomipramine) may somewhat worsen certain features of schizophrenia, necessitating caution in prescribing them to someone with it and continuation of the antipsychotic treatment (e.g., with risperidone or olanzapine). However, certain bodies of evidence have found maprotiline a useful augment in treating some of the &quot;negative&quot;, or &quot;anaesthetic&quot;, symptoms of schizophrenia and in probable extension pronounced &quot;schizoidia&quot; (including the characteristic deterioration in personal grooming/appearance). It has also been weighed against fluvoxamine in this overall regard (i.e., treating the &quot;negative symptoms&quot; of schizophrenia), with fluvoxamine evidencing clear superiority therein. Maprotiline, however, may be specifically useful for the &quot;negative symptom&quot; of alogia (poverty of thought and/or speech) and in this regard was found demonstrably superior to the other control-drugs (alprazolam, bromocriptine, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, nortriptyline) in one study. Citalopram, clomipramine and fluvoxamine appeared particularly useful in the study for reducing &quot;affective blunting&quot;, with alprazolam (Xanax) and maprotiline ranking joint-next.

Patients with bipolar affective disorder should not receive antidepressants whilst in a manic phase (including hypomania) under any circumstances whatsoever. (By the same analogy, people with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type should not be taking maprotiline or other antidepressants while manic.) This is because antidepressants are known to come with the risk of worsening acute mania or precipitating it in so vulnerably-predisposed people.

They (antidepressants) may also negatively interfere with the treatment of mixed bipolar states (pure or schizo-affective), where electro-convulsive therapy (generally bilateral), valproate and antipsychotics prove more beneficial (lithium should not be administered concurrently with E.C.T. treatment, as it may induce severe confusion). However, maprotiline (at a high dose) was put to good use in one particular case, of one young man presenting with what was very-possibly a mixed-manic episode with a heavy preponderance of depressive symptoms (appearing as depression with significant narcissistic traits; including &quot;extrapunitive&quot; tendencies/blame-shifting, entitlement and interpersonal exploitation; and provisionally considered &quot;narcissistic depression&quot;). The maprotiline was combined with mirtazapine (low-dose), sodium valproate and aripiprazole.

===Absolute===
* Hypersensitivity to maprotiline or to other TCAs and TeCAs
* Hypertrophy of the prostate gland with urine hesitancy
* Closed angle glaucoma

===Special caution needed===
* Concomitant treatment with a MAO inhibitor
* Serious impairment of liver and kidney function
* Epilepsy and other conditions that lower the seizure threshold (active brain tumors, alcohol withdrawal, other medications)
* Serious cardiovascular conditions (arrhythmias, heart insufficiency, state after myocardial infarction etc.)
* Treatment of patients under age 18

===Suicidal patients===
As with other antidepressants, maprotiline increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of maprotiline or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Maprotiline is not approved for use in pediatric patients.

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Reproduction studies have been performed in female laboratory rabbits, mice, and rats at doses up to 1.3, 7, and 9 times the maximum daily human dose respectively and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to maprotiline. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Maprotiline is excreted in breast milk. At steady-state, the concentrations in milk correspond closely to the concentrations in whole blood. Caution should be exercised when maprotiline hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman.

==Side effects==
The side-effect profile is comparable to other TCAs and TeCAS and many of the following are due to anticholinergic (which are less prominent than those of most TCAs) and antihistamine effects. Most often seen are:
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Somnolence
* Fatigue
* Dry mouth (and complications of long-term uncontrolled dry mouth such as dental caries) 
* Constipation
* Vertigo
* Nausea (rare, incidence of ~2%) and vomiting
* Increased appetite and weight gain
* Orthostatic hypotension, hypertension, sinus tachycardia, heart-block, arrhythmias and other cardiac effects
* Sexual dysfunction in men: impotence, priapism, delayed ejaculation, anejaculation, decreased libido
* Sexual dysfunction in women: decreased libido, vaginal dryness, painful sexual intercourse, anorgasmia
* Allergic skin reactions such as rash or urticaria (more often than with other antidepressants). Rarely, severe skin reactions such as erythema multiforme can occur.
* Photosensitivity
* Agitation, confusion
* Induction of hypomania or mania in patients with underlying bipolar affective disorder
* Psychotic symptoms
* Tremor
* Extrapyramidal symptoms
* Headache
* Seizures (at high doses)
* Rare haematological complications: leukopenia and agranulocytosis (dangerous fall in white blood cells)
* Fever
* Urinary retention

Maprotiline causes a strong initial sedation (first 2 to 3 weeks of therapy) and is therefore indicated to treat agitated patients or those with suicidal risks. It causes anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, constipation, urinary hesitancy, etc.) with much lower incidence than amitriptyline. Originally, the manufacturer claimed that maprotiline is better tolerated than other TCAs and TeCAs. However, seizures, leukopenia and skin reactions occur more often with maprotiline than with comparable drugs (e.g., amitriptyline, protriptyline, mirtazapine). Indeed, seizures are greater risk for concern with maprotiline than with all other tricyclic antidepressants (rising from 75 mg, becoming significant at daily doses ≥ 200 m.g.), including clomipramine. It should thus be prescribed with particular, if not extreme, caution to people with a history of epilepsy/seizures of any other kind. In any case, the total daily dose should be kept to ≤ 225 milligrams.

Maprotiline has no known potential for abuse and psychological dependence.

===Withdrawal===
Withdrawal symptoms frequently seen when treatment with maprotiline is stopped abruptly (agitation, anxiety, insomnia, sometimes activation of mania or rebound depression) can be avoided by reducing the daily dose of maprotiline gradually by approximately 25% each week. If treatment has to be stopped at once for medical reasons, the use of a benzodiazepine (e.g., lorazepam, clonazepam, diazepam) for a maximum of 4 weeks as needed will usually suppress withdrawal symptoms.

== Interactions ==

Maprotiline does have a wide range of possible interactions. Some are typical for TCAs and TeCAs, others are caused by specific metabolic effects (e.g., high plasma-protein-binding) of maprotiline:

Increased drug actions:
* Other antidepressants, barbiturates, narcotics, sedating antihistamines, anticonvulsive drugs, alcohol resulting in increased central depression and necessitating some caution when using any of these drugs alongside maprotiline 
* Drugs with potential anti-muscarinic/anti-cholinergic activity (antiparkinsonian agents, atropine, amantadine, clozapine and tricyclic antidepressants besides maprotiline) resulting in increased anti-muscarinic effects (dry mouth, constipation, etc.)
* Sympathomimetics (also those used in local anesthetics like noradrenaline) sympathomimetic effects increased (increased blood-pressure, pulse-rate, paleness of skin, etc.)
* Nitrates and antihypertensives (e.g., beta-blockers) increased antihypertensive action with pronounced fall in blood pressure

Although concurrent administration of tricyclic antidepressants (likewise with SSRIs) and MAOIs has been considered particularly dangerous, even fatal, across various medical and pharmaceutical lines across the decades, the premise for this line of thinking, although commonly accepted, may be erroneous. Specialist-research into this and practical clinical experience involving the co-administration of tricyclics and MAOIs have suggested that it is only tricyclics with strong specific serotonin-reuptake inhibitory action (clomipramine and, to a lesser extent, imipramine) that are dangerous to give in combination with MAOIs. Other antidepressants; which may or may not have a significant serotoninergic background otherwise but either way lack in particularly appreciable reuptake-inhibition therein specifically (e.g., mirtazapine, amitriptyline, trazodone, lofepramine, nortriptyline); may be safe to take alongside MAOIs, where the likes of venlafaxine, SSRIs and clomipramine are not. With maprotiline, this has been demonstrated to be the case with moclobemide, a drug it is often compared and considered somewhat analogous (along certain lines) to, and, tentatively, brofaromine (a research-agent MAOI which was never brought to full marketing development). Moclobemide specifically, however, may increase maprptiline plasma-levels and may necessitate dose-modification(s).

In any case, however, it is very-strongly advised that an MAOI is added to the (compatible) tricyclic and not the other way around, as adding a tricyclic to an existing treatment-regime involving an MAOI may significantly increase the risk of going into hypertensive crisis.

Decreased drug actions:
* Guanethidine, reserpine, guanfacine: anti-hypertensive effects decreased
* Clonidine: anti-hypertensive effects decreased and risk of (massive) rebound hypertension.

Other types of interaction:
* Drugs which induce certain enzymes in the liver, e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine and oral anti-conceptive drugs, enhance the elimination of maprotiline and decrease its antidepressant effects. Additionally the blood-concentrations of phenytoin or carbamazepine may be increased, leading to a higher incidents of side effects.
* The concomitant use of maprotiline and neuroleptics can lead to increased maprotiline blood-levels and to seizures. Combining maprotiline and thioridazine could induce severe arrhythmias.
* Additionally, increased blood-levels of maprotiline are possible, if certain beta-blocking agents (e.g., propranolol) are given concomitantly.
* Maprotiline may amplify the actions of coumarin-type anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, phenprocoumon). The plasma-prothrombin-activity must be assessed closely in order to avoid overt bleedings.
* Maprotiline can increase the actions of oral antidiabetic drugs (sulfonylureas) and insulin. Diabetic patients should have regular assessments of their blood-glucose-levels.
* The concomitant application with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine may lead to significantly increased plasma-levels of maprotiline, with a correspondingly (and substantially) incidence of maprotiline side effects. Owing to the long half-lives of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, this effect may persist for quite-some time.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===

Maprotiline exhibits strong effects as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with only weak actions the reuptake of serotonin and dopamine. It is also a strong antagonist of the H1 receptor, a moderate antagonist of the 5-HT2 and α1-adrenergic receptors, and a weak antagonist of the D2 and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Maprotiline has also more recently been identified as a potent antagonist of the 5-HT7 receptor, with this action potentially playing an important role in its antidepressant effectiveness. The drug is a strong antihistamine, but unlike most TCAs, has minimal anticholinergic effects.

The pharmacological profile of maprotiline explains its antidepressant, sedative, anxiolytic, and sympathomimetic activities. In accordance to the pharmacological characteristics it is used in the treatment of depression, such as depression associated with agitation or anxiety. Additionally, it shows strong antagonism against reserpine-induced effects in animal studies, as do the other &#x27;classical&#x27; antidepressants. Although maprotiline behaves in most regards as a &#x27;first-generation antidepressant&#x27; it is commonly referred to as &#x27;second-generation antidepressant&#x27;.

The postulated mechanism of maprotiline is that it acts primarily by potentiation of central adrenergic synapses by blocking reuptake of norepinephrine at nerve endings. This pharmacological action is thought to be primarily responsible for the drug&#x27;s antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. It is a strong norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with only weak effects on serotonin and dopamine reuptake. At higher doses, however, maprotiline increases serotonergic transmission and increases the level of serotonin available.

===Pharmacokinetics===
After oral use absorption is good. It binds to plasma proteins 80–90%. Maximal plasma concentration is reached 6 hours after use. The mean time to peak is 12 hours. The terminal half-life of averages 51 hours.

==Chemistry==

Maprotiline is a tetracyclic compound and is grouped with the TeCAs. Its chemical name is &quot;N&quot;-methyl-9,10-ethanoanthracen-9(10&quot;H&quot;)-propylamine. The drug has a dibenzobicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene (9,10-dihydro-9,10-ethanoanthracene) ring system; that is, a tricyclic anthracene ring system with an ethylene bridge across the central ring. This results in it having a unique three-dimensional central ring (a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane or 1,4-endoethylenecyclohexane ring) and being a tetracyclic rather than a tricyclic compound. However, it could also or alternatively be considered to be a tricyclic and hence a TCA. In addition to its heterocyclic ring system, maprotiline has an alkylamine side chain attached similarly to other TCAs (but notably unlike other TeCAs). In terms of the side chain, it is a secondary amine, and its chemical structure, aside from the ethylene link in the central ring, is similar to that of secondary amine TCAs like nortriptyline and protriptyline. In accordance, the pharmacology of maprotiline is very similar to that of secondary amine TCAs.

Maprotiline is very similar in structure to the anxiolytic, sedative, and muscle relaxant drug benzoctamine (Tacitin). The only structural difference between the two compounds is in the length of their side chain. However, this modification results in considerable differences in their pharmacological and therapeutic effects.

==History==
Maprotiline was developed by Ciba (now operated by Novartis). It was patented in 1966 and was first described in the literature in 1969. The drug was introduced for medical use in 1974. Generics are now widely available. It was introduced after most of the other TCAs but was the first TeCA to be developed and marketed, with the TeCAs mianserin and amoxapine following shortly thereafter and mirtazapine being introduced later on.

==Society and culture==

<text>Paulus Johannes &quot;Paul&quot; Biegel (25 March 1925 – 21 October 2006) was a Dutch writer of children&#x27;s literature.

==Biography==
Paul Biegel was born in Bussum in 1925. His father, Hermann Biegel, was of German descent, and owned a building materials shop. With his wife Madeleine Povel-Guillot he had nine children, six girls and three boys, of whom Paul was the youngest. He was not a prolific reader as a child, preferring to play outside. His favourite books were the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm and the works of Jules Verne. He studied in Bussum (primary school) and Amsterdam, graduating in 1945.

His first story, &quot;De ontevreden kabouter&quot; (&quot;The unhappy gnome&quot;), written when he was 14 years old, was printed in the newspaper &quot;De Tijd&quot;. He wanted to become a pianist, but decided that he didn&#x27;t have enough talent. He went to the United States for a year after World War II, where he worked for &#x27;. After his return, he worked as an editor for Dutch magazines like the &#x27;. He commenced Law Studies, but stopped these in 1953. He wrote several newspaper comics, the most important of which was &quot;Minter and Hinter&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Het Vrije Volk&quot; for ten stories and 579 episodes. In 1959, he started working in the comic studio of Marten Toonder as a comics writer for the &quot;Kappie&quot; series.

He only published his first book, &quot;De gouden gitaar&quot;, in 1962. He became one of the most important Dutch writers for children in 1965, when he received the Gouden Griffel for &quot;Het sleutelkruid&quot;. In 1973, he won the Staatsprijs voor kinder- en jeugdliteratuur literary award. He has written over 50 books, mostly published by Holland, and many of his books have been translated in English, French, German, Danish, Swedish, Welsh, South African, Japanese, Turkish, Greek, and Spanish. His own favourites were &quot;De tuinen van Dorr&quot; and &quot;De soldatenmaker&quot;. Other authors he appreciated included J. R. R. Tolkien, J. K. Rowling, and Hans Christian Andersen.

Paul Biegel lived in Amsterdam. He married Marijke Sträter in 1960, with whom he had a daughter, Leonie, in 1963, and in 1964 a son, Arthur, who committed suicide when he was 28. His marriage ultimately failed, and only at a later age did he publicly admit to being homosexual. He died in 2006 and was buried at Zorgvlied cemetery. In 2007, publishers Holland and Lemniscaat started reissuing twenty of his best works in the &quot;Biegelbibliotheek&quot;.

<doc id="287250" wikidata="Q220210" url="?curid=287250" title="George Steinbrenner">
<text>George Michael Steinbrenner III (July 4, 1930July 13, 2010) was an American businessman who was the principal owner and managing partner of Major League Baseball&#x27;s New York Yankees from 1973 until his death in 2010. He was the longest-serving owner in club history, and the Yankees won seven World Series championships and 11 American League pennants under his ownership. His outspokenness and role in driving up player salaries made him one of the sport&#x27;s most controversial figures. Steinbrenner was also involved in the Great Lakes and Gulf Coast shipping industry.

Originally known as a very hands-on owner, Steinbrenner earned the nickname &quot;the Boss&quot;. He had a tendency to meddle in daily on-field decisions, and to hire and fire (and sometimes re-hire) managers. Former Yankees manager Dallas Green gave him the derisive nickname &quot;Manager George&quot;. However, from the early 1990s onward, he mostly left the Yankees in the hands of the baseball operations staff and rarely interfered. He officially retired from day-to-day control of the team in 2008.

He died after suffering a heart attack in his Tampa home on the morning of July 13, 2010, the day of the 81st All-Star Game. The Yankees are now owned by Yankee Global Enterprises, for which Steinbrenner&#x27;s four children have served as general partners.

==Early life and education==
Steinbrenner was born in Rocky River, Ohio, the only son of Rita (née Haley) and Henry George Steinbrenner II. His mother was an Irish immigrant who had changed her name from O&#x27;Haley to Haley. His father was of German descent and was a world-class track and field hurdler while at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which he graduated in engineering in 1927, first in his class and a distinguished scholar in naval architecture. The elder Steinbrenner later became a wealthy shipping magnate who ran the family firm operating freight ships hauling ore and grain on the Great Lakes, inherited from his great-grandmother Sophia Steinbrenner and her mother Anna Minch. George III was named after his paternal grandfather, George Michael Steinbrenner II. Steinbrenner had two younger sisters, Susan and Judy. At age nine, the elder Steinbrenner staked George to a couple of hundred chickens, and he peddled hens and their eggs door to door. &quot;I learned a lot about business from raising chickens,&quot; he told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. &quot;Half of my customers began buying because they were afraid of me.&quot;

In 1944, Steinbrenner entered Culver Military Academy in Northern Indiana, graduating in 1948. He received his B.A. from Williams College in 1952. While at Williams, George was an average student who led an active extracurricular life. He was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He was an accomplished hurdler on the varsity track and field team, and served as sports editor of &quot;The Williams Record&quot;, played piano in the band, and played halfback on the football team in his senior year. He joined the United States Air Force after graduation, was commissioned a second lieutenant and was stationed at Lockbourne Air Force Base in Columbus, Ohio. Following honorable discharge in 1954, he did post-graduate study at Ohio State University (1954–55), earning his master&#x27;s degree in physical education.

He met his wife-to-be, Elizabeth Joan Zieg, in Columbus, and married her on May 12, 1956. The couple had two sons, Hank and Hal, and two daughters, Jessica Steinbrenner and Jennifer Steinbrenner-Swindal. The Steinbrenners also have numerous grandchildren. All four of the Steinbrenners&#x27; children eventually got divorced, some multiple times, resulting in several former-in-laws being removed from the Yankees&#x27; management.

==Pre-Yankees career==

While studying at Ohio State, he served as a graduate assistant to Buckeye football coach Woody Hayes. The Buckeyes were undefeated national champions that year, and won the Rose Bowl. Steinbrenner served as an assistant football coach at Northwestern University in 1955, and at Purdue University from 1956 to 1957.

Steinbrenner joined Kinsman Marine Transit Company in 1957, the Great Lakes shipping company that his great-grandfather Henry had purchased in 1901 from The Minch Transit Company, which was owned by a family relation, and renamed. Steinbrenner worked hard to successfully revitalize the company, which was suffering hardship during difficult market conditions. In its return to profitability, Kinsman emphasized grain shipments over ore. A few years later, with the help of a loan from a New York bank, Steinbrenner purchased the company from his family. He later became part of a group that purchased the American Shipbuilding Company, and, in 1967, he became its chairman and chief executive officer. By 1972, the company&#x27;s gross sales were more than $100 million annually.

In 1960, against his father&#x27;s wishes, Steinbrenner entered the sports franchise business for the first time with basketball&#x27;s Cleveland Pipers, of the National Industrial Basketball League (NIBL). Steinbrenner had hired John McClendon, who became the first African American coach in professional basketball and persuaded Jerry Lucas to join his team instead of the rival National Basketball Association. The Pipers switched leagues, to the new professional ABL in 1961; the new circuit was founded by Abe Saperstein, owner of the Harlem Globetrotters. The league and its teams experienced financial problems, and McClendon resigned in protest halfway through the season. However, the Pipers had won the first half of a split season. Steinbrenner replaced McClendon with former Boston Celtics star Bill Sharman, and the Pipers won the ABL championship in 1961–62. The ABL folded in December 1962, just months into its second season. Steinbrenner and his partners lost significant money on the venture, but Steinbrenner paid off all of his creditors and partners over the next few years.

With his burgeoning sports aspirations put on hold, Steinbrenner turned his attention to the theatre. His involvement with Broadway began with a short-lived 1967 play, &quot;The Ninety Day Mistress&quot;, in which he partnered with another rookie producer, James M. Nederlander. Whereas Nederlander threw himself into his family&#x27;s business full-time, Steinbrenner invested in a mere half-dozen shows, including the 1974 Tony Award nominee for Best Musical, &quot;Seesaw&quot;, and the 1988 Peter Allen flop, &quot;Legs Diamond&quot;.

==New York Yankees career==

The Yankees had been struggling during their years under CBS ownership, which had acquired the team in 1965. In 1972, CBS chairman William S. Paley told team president E. Michael Burke the media company intended to sell the club. As Burke later told writer Roger Kahn, Paley offered to sell the franchise to Burke if he could find financial backing. Steinbrenner, who had participated in a failed attempt to buy the Cleveland Indians from Vernon Stouffer one year earlier, and who had been an investor in Buffalo&#x27;s failed 1969 Major League Baseball expansion bid, was brought together with Burke by veteran baseball executive Gabe Paul.

On January 3, 1973, Steinbrenner and minority partner Burke led a group of investors, which included Nederlander, Lester Crown, John DeLorean, Nelson Bunker Hunt, and Marvin L. Warner, in purchasing the Yankees from CBS. For years, the selling price was reported to be $10 million. However, Steinbrenner later revealed that the deal included two parking garages that CBS had bought from the city, and soon after the deal closed, CBS bought back the garages for $1.2 million. The net cost to the group for the Yankees was, therefore, $8.8 million.

The announced intention was that Burke would continue to run the team as club president. But Burke later became angry when he found out that Paul had been brought in as a senior Yankee executive, reducing his authority, and quit the team presidency in April 1973. (Burke remained a minority owner of the club into the following decade, but as fellow minority owner John McMullen stated, &quot;There is nothing in life quite so limited as being a limited partner of George Steinbrenner.&quot;) Paul was officially named president of the club on April 19. It would be the first of many high-profile departures with employees who crossed paths with &quot;The Boss&quot;. At the conclusion of the 1973 season, two more prominent names departed: manager Ralph Houk, who resigned and took a similar position with the Detroit Tigers; and general manager Lee MacPhail, who became president of the American League.

The 1973 off-season would continue to be controversial when Steinbrenner and Paul fought to hire former Oakland Athletics manager Dick Williams, who had resigned immediately after leading the team to its second straight World Series title. However, because Williams was still under contract to Oakland, the subsequent legal wrangling prevented the Yankees from hiring him. On the first anniversary of the team&#x27;s ownership change, the Yankees hired former Pittsburgh Pirates manager Bill Virdon to lead the team on the field.

During the 1981 World Series, Steinbrenner provided a colorful backdrop to the Yankees&#x27; loss of the series. After a Game 3 loss in Los Angeles, Steinbrenner called a press conference in his hotel room, showing off his left hand in a cast and various other injuries that he claimed were earned in a fight with two Dodgers fans in the hotel elevator. Nobody came forward about the fight, leading to the belief that he had made up the story of the fight to light a fire under the Yankees. After the series, he issued a public apology to the City of New York for his team&#x27;s performance, while at the same time assuring the fans that plans to put the team together for 1982 would begin immediately. He was criticized heartily by players and press alike for doing so, as most people felt losing in the World Series was not something requiring an apology.

===Facial hair policy===

Steinbrenner enforced a military-style grooming code: All players, coaches, and male executives were forbidden to display any facial hair other than mustaches (except for religious reasons), and scalp hair could not be grown below the collar. (Long sideburns and &quot;mutton chops&quot; were not specifically banned.) The policy led to some unusual and comical incidents.

During the 1973 home opener against the Cleveland Indians, as the Yankees, caps removed, were standing at attention for the National Anthem, Steinbrenner, in the owner&#x27;s box next to the New York dugout, noticed that several players&#x27; hair was too long for his standards. As he did not yet know the players&#x27; names, he wrote down the uniform numbers of the offenders (Thurman Munson, Bobby Murcer, and Sparky Lyle), and had the list, along with the demand that their hair be trimmed immediately, delivered to Houk. The order was reluctantly relayed to the players.

In 1983, at Steinbrenner&#x27;s behest, Yankee coach Yogi Berra ordered Goose Gossage to remove a beard he was growing. Gossage responded by shaving away the beard but leaving a thick exaggerated mustache extending down the upper lip to the jaw line, a look Gossage still sports to this day.

The most infamous incident involving facial hair occurred in 1991. Although Steinbrenner was suspended, Yankees management ordered Don Mattingly, who was then sporting a mullet-like hairstyle, to get a haircut. When Mattingly refused, he was benched. This led to a huge media frenzy with reporters and talk radio repeatedly mocking the team. The WPIX broadcasting crew of Phil Rizzuto, Bobby Murcer, and Tom Seaver lampooned the policy on a pregame show with Rizzuto playing the role of a barber sent to enforce the rule. Mattingly would eventually be reinstated. Coincidentally, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;, which was filmed earlier that year, included Mattingly as a guest star who is suspended from play by Mr. Burns for his sideburns being too long, despite shaving the area of his head above where sideburns grow. In 1995, Mattingly again ran afoul of the policy when he grew a goatee.

In 2005, after signing with the Yankees, former Boston Red Sox center fielder Johnny Damon, who was known for his long beard and shoulder-length hair during his time with the Red Sox, said about the policy: &quot;Without a doubt, George Steinbrenner has a policy and I&#x27;m going to stick to it. Our policy with the Yankees is to go out there and win and we&#x27;re going to try and bring another championship to them.&quot; Steinbrenner later noted, &quot;He looks like a Yankee, he sounds like a Yankee and he is a Yankee.&quot; Damon claimed he was already planning on cutting his hair after the 2005 season.

===Criticism of Dave Winfield===
After the 1980 season, Steinbrenner made headlines by signing Dave Winfield to a 10-year, $23 million contract, making Winfield baseball&#x27;s highest-paid player. In 1985, Steinbrenner derided Winfield&#x27;s poor performance in a key September series against the Toronto Blue Jays:

This criticism eventually became somewhat of an anachronism, as many believed Steinbrenner made the statement following the 1981 World Series. Part of that comment later led Ken Griffey Jr. to list the Yankees as one team for which he would never play.

In 2001, Winfield cited Steinbrenner&#x27;s animosity as a factor in his decision to enter the Hall of Fame as a representative of his first team, the San Diego Padres, rather than the team that increased his national recognition, the Yankees.

===Reinstatement and championship years===
Steinbrenner was reinstated in 1993. Unlike past years, he was somewhat less inclined to interfere in the Yankees&#x27; baseball operations. He left day-to-day baseball matters in the hands of Gene Michael and other executives and allowed promising farm-system players such as Bernie Williams to develop instead of trading them for established players. Steinbrenner&#x27;s having &quot;got religion&quot; (in the words of &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reporter Bill Madden) paid off. After contending only briefly two years earlier, the 1993 Yankees were in the American League East race with the eventual champion Toronto Blue Jays until September.

The 1994 Yankees were the American League East leaders when a players&#x27; strike wiped out the rest of the season. Coincidentally, a players&#x27; strike had aided their 1981 playoff effort.

In 1995 the team returned to the playoffs for the first time since 1981. However, Steinbrenner elected to fire manager Buck Showalter after the series ended in a decisive Game 5 loss to the Seattle Mariners. He also fired Michael from the GM spot after the season ended. Three days after firing Showalter on October 31, rankled by the angry responses by fans, he attempted to woo him back (while presumably moving Joe Torre to a desk job rather than the manager position). Showalter elected to honor the word he gave to the Arizona Diamondbacks and thus Steinbrenner went with Torre to manage the team. In 1996, the Yankees beat the Atlanta Braves in six games to win the World Series. They went on to Series wins in , , and , and fell short of a fourth straight title in with a seventh-game loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks.

The Yankees then made the playoffs every season through 2007. In 2003, they beat the Boston Red Sox to win the AL pennant, but lost the World Series to the Florida Marlins, denying Steinbrenner—who had won the Stanley Cup in June of that year as part-owner of the New Jersey Devils—the distinction of winning championships in two major sports leagues in the same year.

In 2008, the Yankees ended their postseason run with a third-place finish in the American League East. However, in 2009, the Yankees defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series to win a 27th championship, seven of which had been won under Steinbrenner&#x27;s ownership.

==Retirement==
Steinbrenner named Steve Swindal, his son-in-law, to be his successor in June 2005. When Swindal and Jennifer Steinbrenner divorced in 2007, the Yankees bought Swindal out of his financial stake in the team, with Hal Steinbrenner succeeding Swindal as chairman of Yankee Global Enterprises.

From 2006 to his death, Steinbrenner spent most of his time in Tampa, Florida. After the 2007 season and the decision not to bring back manager Joe Torre, Steinbrenner was in poor enough health that he officially retired and handed control of the Yankees to his sons Hal and Hank Steinbrenner. The transition was formally completed in 2008.

After ceding day-to-day control of the team, Steinbrenner made few public appearances and gave no interviews. Associates and family members refused to comment on rampant speculation concerning his declining health, specifically rumors that he was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. A 2007 interviewer said: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t look all right. In fact, he looks dreadful. His body is bloated; his jawline has slackened into a triple chin; his skin looks as if a dry-cleaner bag has been stretched over it. Steinbrenner&#x27;s face, pale and swollen, has a curiously undefined look. His features seem frozen in a permanent rictus of careworn disbelief.&quot; The Yankees went to great lengths to prevent anyone outside Steinbrenner&#x27;s immediate family and closest business associates from speaking to him, or even getting a glimpse of him on the rare occasions when he made an appearance at Yankee Stadium. Temporary curtains were set up to block views of his entry and exit routes, and no one was allowed near the vehicles transporting him. The press elevator carrying media members downstairs to the interview areas was shut down before he arrived, and again toward the end of the game while he departed.

Steinbrenner made a rare appearance in the Bronx on the field for the 79th All-Star Game on July 15, 2008. Wearing dark glasses, he walked slowly into the stadium&#x27;s media entrance with the aid of several companions, leaning upon one of them for support. He later was driven out on to the field along with his son Hal at the end of the lengthy pre-game ceremony in which the All-Stars were introduced at their fielding positions along with 49 of the 63 living Hall of Famers.

In subsequent occasional visits to spring training, regular-season games, and other outings, he used a wheelchair.

On April 13, 2010, Derek Jeter and Joe Girardi privately presented the first 2009 World Series Championship ring to Steinbrenner in his stadium suite. He was &quot;almost speechless&quot;, according to reports.

Steinbrenner&#x27;s estimated net worth was $1.15 billion in 2009 according to the Forbes 400 List in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine issued in September 2009. He was the first owner of a baseball team to sell cable TV rights (to MSG Network).

==Death==

On July 13, 2010, the morning of the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Steinbrenner died of a heart attack at St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in Tampa, Florida. His death came nine days after his 80th birthday, two days after the death of longtime Yankee Stadium public address announcer Bob Sheppard, and eight days before that of former Yankee manager Ralph Houk. On July 14, the Yankees announced that players and coaches would wear a Steinbrenner commemorative patch on the left breast of their home and road uniforms, and a Bob Sheppard commemorative patch on the left arm. July 15 marked the Yankees&#x27; first home game at Yankee Stadium after both the All-Star break and Steinbrenner&#x27;s passing. Prior to the game, the team presented a mural above the right-center field bleachers in the late owner&#x27;s honor while closer Mariano Rivera laid a bouquet of flowers on home plate.
The Steinbrenner family added a monument to Monument Park on September 20, 2010, to honor Steinbrenner. He is buried at Trinity Memorial Gardens in Trinity, Florida.
==Off the field==
In addition to being an intense boss to his on-field employees, Steinbrenner was also known for pressuring and changing off-field employees (including various publicity directors), sometimes chewing them out in public. Longtime Cardinals announcer Jack Buck once said that he had seen Steinbrenner&#x27;s yacht and that, &quot;It was a beautiful thing to observe, with all 36 oars working in unison.&quot; Former sportscaster Hank Greenwald, who called Yankee games on WABC radio for two years, once said he knew when Steinbrenner was in town by how tense the office staff was.

Steinbrenner usually kept his complaints about the team broadcasters he approved of (except for the YES Network crew, who have generally not been his direct employees) out of the newspapers. However, he was known to be upset with the sometimes blunt commentary of former broadcaster Jim Kaat and former analyst Tony Kubek.

The 1986 World Series was called &quot;Steinbrenner&#x27;s nightmare&quot;, because it was a showdown between two of the Yankees&#x27; biggest rivals, their cross-town rival the New York Mets and their most hated rival, the Boston Red Sox. As a result, Steinbrenner wrote articles in the &quot;New York Post&quot; on the World Series. The Mets won that World Series, which relieved many Yankee fans. In addition, Yankees fans attended the parade saying that &quot;anyone who beats Boston is worth coming down for.&quot;

Steinbrenner had a reputation as a domineering boss. Only three Yankee employees were continuously employed from the start of Steinbrenner&#x27;s ownership in 1973 until the end of his tenure. One of those is long time Head Athletic Trainer Gene Monahan, who in 2010 missed his first spring training in 48 years after being diagnosed with cancer.

Harvey Greene, the Yankees&#x27; Director of Media Relations from 1986 to 1989, talked about the experience of working under Steinbrenner:
:&quot;When the team was on the road, you&#x27;d come back to your hotel late at night, and if your phone light was on, you knew that either there had been a death in the family or George was looking for you. After a while, you started to hope that there had been a death in the family.&quot;

Steinbrenner was involved with thoroughbred horse racing from the early 1970s. He owned Kinsman Stud Farm in Ocala, Florida and raced under the name Kinsman Stable.

===Charitable work===
Steinbrenner gave to many charitable causes. In 1982, George, &quot;while attending the funeral of a police officer killed in the line of duty, was deeply moved by the ceremony in which the American flag was folded military-style and presented to the officer&#x27;s surviving spouse and young children&quot;. &quot;He was concerned about their education and who would help with the cost, so he established the Silver Shield Foundation,&quot; said Foundation&#x27;s Co-founder James E. Fuchs, a close friend of Mr. Steinbrenner&#x27;s. He often donated to the families of fallen police officers in the Tampa Police Department and the New York City Police Department in addition to college scholarships for many poor children.

During the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, Steinbrenner comforted United States Olympic Swimming medalist Ron Karnaugh through his father&#x27;s death and maintained a relationship with him until his death. At his residence in Tampa, Steinbrenner supported numerous individuals and charities including the Boys and Girls Club as well as the Salvation Army. Mel Stottlemyre recalled that during his myeloma cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital he had mentioned in passing to Steinbrenner how he regretted not being able to watch Yankee games from his room. Stottlemyre heard that Steinbrenner went all the way to Mayor Rudy Giuliani to ensure he was able to watch the broadcasts from his room. Steinbrenner had also donated $1 million to St. Joseph&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospital where a wing was named in his honor.

=== Politics ===
Although Steinbrenner was a registered Republican, he donated money to numerous Democratic senators and representatives, including $6,300 to Chuck Schumer, $9,600 to Charles Rangel, $1,000 to Peter W. Rodino, and $750 to George J. Mitchell. Steinbrenner generally voted Republican at the presidential level, having supported George H. W. Bush in the 1988 and 1992 elections, as well as George W. Bush in 2000 (and donating $5,000 to the Bush-Cheney Florida recount fund). However, in 2008, Steinbrenner&#x27;s presidential donations crossed party lines, as he donated to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton along with Republican candidates Rudy Giuliani and John McCain, contributing $2,300 to Clinton&#x27;s campaign, $4,600 to Giuliani&#x27;s campaign, and $15,000 to McCain Victory 2008.

== Controversies ==

=== Management style ===
Early on, Steinbrenner became infamous in Cleveland circles for berating anyone who dared cross him. This style followed him to the Yankees; he quickly became infamous for overseeing rapid turnover of management personnel. In his first 23 seasons, he changed managers 20 times; Billy Martin alone was fired and rehired five times. During his first 26 years with the club, he went through 13 public relations directors. &quot;The first time George fires you, it&#x27;s very traumatic,&quot; oft-fired Yankees flack Harvey Greene said. &quot;The three or four times after that, it&#x27;s like, Great! I&#x27;ve got the rest of the day off.&quot; Greene, the Yankees&#x27; PR director was fired by Steinbrenner, however the next day Steinbrenner&#x27;s assistant called Greene and asked why he wasn&#x27;t at work. After arriving at work late, Steinbrenner told Greene &quot;If you&#x27;re late again, you&#x27;re fired.&quot;

Steinbrenner employed 11 general managers over 30 years. He was equally famous for pursuing high-priced free agents (i.e., Catfish Hunter, Reggie Jackson, and Dave Winfield) and then feuding with them. In July 1978, Billy Martin famously said of Steinbrenner and his $3 million outfielder Reggie Jackson, &quot;The two were meant for each other. One&#x27;s a born liar, and the other&#x27;s convicted.&quot; The comment resulted in Martin&#x27;s first departure, though officially he resigned (tearfully), before Yankees President Al Rosen could carry out Steinbrenner&#x27;s dictum to fire him.

David Wells recalled he and Steinbrenner almost got into a fight during a heated argument. Wells later apologized to Steinbrenner for threatening to fight him.

===Illegal campaign contributions to Nixon===
The &quot;convicted&quot; part of Billy Martin&#x27;s famous 1978 &quot;liar and convicted&quot; comment referred to Steinbrenner&#x27;s connection to Richard Nixon; in 1974, Steinbrenner pleaded guilty to making illegal contributions to Nixon&#x27;s re-election campaign, and to a felony charge of obstruction of justice. Faced with a cost overrun problem with the United States Commerce Department, Steinbrenner gave six of his American Shipbuilding employees &quot;special bonuses&quot; of $25,000 and directed them to then turn around and personally donate the funds to Nixon&#x27;s Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP).

Steinbrenner originally said he would fight the charges in court, but in August 1974, two weeks after Nixon resigned, Steinbrenner pleaded guilty to two charges in the case. He was personally fined $15,000 and his company American Shipbuilding was assessed an additional $20,000. On November 27 of that year, MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn suspended him for two years, but later commuted it to fifteen months. Ronald Reagan pardoned Steinbrenner in January 1989, one of the final acts of his presidency.

=== Ban from management and reinstatement ===
On July 30, 1990, Steinbrenner was banned permanently from day-to-day management (but not ownership) of the Yankees by MLB Commissioner Fay Vincent for paying a gambler named Howard Spira $40,000 to dig up &quot;dirt&quot; on Winfield. Winfield had sued the Yankees for failing to contribute $300,000 to his foundation, a guaranteed stipulation in his contract. Vincent proposed a two-year suspension, but Steinbrenner wanted to have it worded as an &quot;agreement&quot; that had him leave baseball rather than a suspension in order to protect his reputation with the U.S. Olympic Committee (he also cited a reason of wanting to see his son take over). After considerable negotiation with Vincent&#x27;s office, Robert Nederlander, one of Steinbrenner&#x27;s theatre partners and a limited partner in the Yankees organization, became the managing general partner. After Nederlander resigned in 1992, he was succeeded by Joe Molloy, George&#x27;s son-in-law. A year later, Steinbrenner asked to be reinstated (having been convinced by owners such as Jerry Reinsdorf that he had made a terrible mistake). Vincent agreed to reinstate him on the condition that he would drop some lawsuits he had others file against Vincent. However, Vincent was removed from his job as commissioner not long after, and Steinbrenner would be reinstated by Vincent&#x27;s successor, Bud Selig.

==In the media==

Steinbrenner poked fun at himself in the media; his frequent firings and rehirings of manager Billy Martin were lampooned in a &#x27;70s Miller Lite beer commercial in which Steinbrenner tells Martin &quot;You&#x27;re fired!&quot; to which Martin replies &quot;Oh, no, not again!&quot; After one of Martin&#x27;s real-life rehirings, the commercial was resurrected, only with Steinbrenner&#x27;s line redubbed to say &quot;You&#x27;re &quot;hired!&quot;&quot; The two commercials would sometimes alternate depending on Martin&#x27;s status with the team.

In 1988, he was featured heavily in the William Goldman and Mike Lupica book &quot;Wait Till Next Year&quot; which looked at life inside the Yankees over a whole season (among other New York sports teams).

Steinbrenner hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) on October 20, 1990, at the same time his former outfielder and Yankee manager, Lou Piniella, led the Cincinnati Reds to a World Series victory. In the opening sketch, he dreamt of a Yankees team managed, coached, and entirely played by himself. In other sketches, he chewed out the &quot;SNL&quot; &quot;writing staff&quot; (notably including Al Franken) for featuring him in a mock Slim Fast commercial with other ruthless leaders such as Saddam Hussein and Idi Amin and played a folksy convenience store manager whose business ethic is virtually the complete opposite of that of the real Steinbrenner.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;, Mr. Burns fires Don Mattingly for refusing to shave sideburns only Burns could see. It is often assumed that this was a parody of an argument Steinbrenner and Mattingly had in real life regarding Mattingly&#x27;s hair length. However, the episode was actually recorded a year before the suspension occurred, and was nothing more than a coincidence. As Mattingly walks off the baseball field, he states, &quot;I still like him [Burns] better than Steinbrenner.&quot;

Steinbrenner appeared as himself in the Albert Brooks comedy &quot;The Scout&quot;. In 1991, he played himself in of &quot;Good Sports&quot;, with Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O&#x27;Neal.

In the 1994 computer game &quot;Superhero League of Hoboken&quot;, one of the schemes of the primary antagonist, Dr. Entropy, is to resurrect George Steinbrenner to bring chaos to the world and rule together. The superheroes foil his plan by resurrecting Billy Martin.

After a public chastising of Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter for &quot;partying too much&quot;, the two appeared in a Visa commercial club-hopping. A 2004 Visa commercial depicted Steinbrenner in the trainer&#x27;s room at Yankee Stadium, suffering from an arm injury, unable to sign any checks, including that of his then-current manager Joe Torre, who spends most of the commercial treating Steinbrenner as if he were an important player.

George Will once described Steinbrenner as an &quot;error machine&quot; and a &quot;baseball dumb-o-meter&quot;.

Steinbrenner also was a fan of professional wrestling. He wrote the foreword of the 2005 Dusty Rhodes autobiography and was a regular at old Tampa Armory cards in the 1970s and 1980s. In March 1989, he appeared in the front row of the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF) &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XX&quot; broadcast, even interacting with manager Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan at one point (Heenan remarked about the guy he managed in the ring at the time to Steinbrenner &quot;I&#x27;ve got a ring full of Winfield&quot;). In December 1990, Steinbrenner made another appearance on WWF TV in the front row during a &quot;Superstars of Wrestling&quot; taping held in Tampa&#x27;s SunDome. Once again he interacted with Heenan and the wrestler he was managing at the time Curt Hennig. At WWF WrestleMania VII, Steinbrenner, WWF owner Vince McMahon, and NFL announcer Paul Maguire filmed a skit with the trio debating instant replay. He was also present in the front row of an edition of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; in 1996, and in the front row of another edition as well early 1998, when the event took place in Tampa.

At the funeral of his long-time friend Otto Graham in December 2003, Steinbrenner fainted, leading to extensive media speculation that he was in ill health.

&quot;New York Daily News&quot; cartoonist Bill Gallo often cited Steinbrenner&#x27;s German heritage by drawing him in a Prussian military uniform, complete with spiked helmet, gold epaulettes and medals, calling him &quot;General von Steingrabber&quot;.

In ESPN&#x27;s miniseries &quot;The Bronx is Burning&quot;, Steinbrenner is portrayed by Oliver Platt.

In the Donald Trump biopic &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, Mr Steinbrenner is briefly portrayed by Jason Blicker.

===&quot;Seinfeld&quot; caricature===
George Steinbrenner appeared as a character in the situation comedy &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, when George Costanza worked for the Yankees for several seasons. Mitch Mitchell and Lee Bear portrayed the character, and Larry David provided voice-over performances whenever the character spoke. Steinbrenner&#x27;s full face was never shown, and the character was always viewed from the back in scenes set in his office at Yankee Stadium. The character appeared in the episodes &quot;The Opposite&quot;, &quot;The Secretary&quot;, &quot;The Race&quot;, &quot;The Jimmy&quot;, &quot;The Wink&quot;, &quot;The Hot Tub&quot;, &quot;The Caddy&quot;, &quot;The Calzone&quot;, &quot;The Bottle Deposit&quot;, &quot;The Nap&quot;, &quot;The Millennium&quot;, &quot;The Muffin Tops&quot;, and &quot;The Finale&quot;.

The fictional Steinbrenner talks nonstop, regardless of whether anyone is listening, and sometimes refers to himself as &quot;Big Stein&quot;. In &quot;The Wink&quot;, Steinbrenner mentions all of the people he fired, saying Billy Martin four times, and mentions then-current manager Buck Showalter, but then quickly swears Costanza to silence. Though intended as a joke, two weeks after the episode aired the Yankees announced that they had parted ways with Showalter.

Steinbrenner&#x27;s involvement with &quot;Seinfeld&quot; began when he refused a request to make a cameo appearance and permit a Yankees pennant to appear; the show nonetheless used the pennant. A year later, Steinbrenner was asked to permit a Yankees uniform to appear on the sixth-season episode, &quot;The Chaperone&quot;. The owner was still angry about the unauthorized pennant, and knew so little about the show that after reading the script he believed George Costanza had been named after him as an insult. He refused to permit the uniform&#x27;s use unless the character was renamed. After watching the show and enjoying both it and the Costanza character, however, Steinbrenner approved the uniform, and later said he felt the show&#x27;s portrayal of him was unflattering but essentially accurate to how he was at the time. He filmed three scenes for the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; season 7 finale, &quot;The Invitations&quot;, but they were edited out when the time of the episode ran longer than allowed.

Jerry Seinfeld said after Steinbrenner&#x27;s death: &quot;Who else could be a memorable character on a television show without actually appearing on the show? You felt George even though he wasn&#x27;t there. That&#x27;s how huge a force of personality he was.&quot;

<text>The West Midlands Metro is a light-rail/tram system in the county of West Midlands, England. The network has 33 stops with a total of of track; it currently consists of a single route, Line 1, which operates between the cities of Birmingham and Wolverhampton via the towns of Bilston, West Bromwich and Wednesbury, on a mixture of former railway lines and urban on-street running. The system is owned by the public body Transport for West Midlands, and operated by Midland Metro Limited, a company wholly owned by the West Midlands Combined Authority.

During August 1995, a 25-year contract for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of Line 1 was awarded to the Altram consortium; construction commenced three months later. It was launched on 30 May 1999 as Midland Metro, partly using the disused Birmingham Snow Hill to Wolverhampton Low Level Line. During 2006, Ansaldo and John Laing Group both withdrew from the consortium, thus day-to-day operation of the Metro was taken over by the remaining partner, National Express. In October 2018, the National Express concession ended and the system was taken over by Transport for West Midlands, the transport arm of the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA).

The line originally terminated at Birmingham Snow Hill station at the edge of the city centre, but following an extension opened in December 2015 it now serves the central core of Birmingham, including the principal regional mainline station, Birmingham New Street. Following further extensions the line has terminated at Edgbaston Village since 2022. At the other end of the line, an extension to Wolverhampton station was opened on 17 September 2023. The Metro was originally operated by a fleet of 16 AnsaldoBreda T-69 trams; these were replaced during the 2010s by a newer fleet of 42 CAF Urbos 3.

Construction of a new branch line from Wednesbury to Brierley Hill was approved in March 2019, started in February 2020 and was intended to be completed for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, but has been severely delayed; it is currently scheduled to be completed at least to Dudley by 2025. An additional branch line running to Birmingham&#x27;s Eastside via Curzon Street – the region&#x27;s planned High Speed 2 terminus – and terminating at Digbeth is also under construction as of 2024. There are also proposals to expand this branch further towards Chelmsley Wood (Solihull) and out to Birmingham Airport.

==History==
Birmingham once had an extensive tram network run by Birmingham Corporation Tramways. However, as in most British cities, the network was wound down and closed by the local authority, with the last tram running in 1953.

===1984 proposals===
Proposals for a light-rail or Metro system in Birmingham and the Black Country had been put forward as early as the 1950s and 1960s, paradoxically at a time when some of the region&#x27;s lines and services were beginning to be cut back. Serious inquiry into the possibility started in 1981, when the West Midlands County Council and the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive formed a joint planning committee to look at light rail as a means of solving the conurbation&#x27;s congestion problems. In summer 1984 they produced a report, &quot;Rapid Transit for the West Midlands&quot;, which set out ambitious proposals for a £500 million network of ten light-rail routes that would be predominantly street-running, but would include some underground sections in Birmingham city centre. One of the proposed routes would have used part of the existing line as far as West Bromwich.

The scheme suffered from several drawbacks, one being that three of the proposed routes, from Birmingham to Sutton Coldfield, Shirley, and Dorridge, would take over existing railways, and would have included the conversion into a tramway of the Cross-City Line between Aston and Blake Street, ending direct rail services to Lichfield. The northern section of the North Warwickshire Line was also to be converted as far as Shirley station, leaving a question mark over existing train services to Stratford-upon-Avon. Tram tracks would also run alongside the existing line to Solihull and Dorridge, and local train services would have ended.

The most serious drawback, however, which proved fatal to the scheme, was that the first proposed route of the network, between Five Ways and Castle Bromwich via the city centre, would have involved the demolition of 238 properties. This invoked strong opposition from local residents. The scheme was spearheaded by Wednesfield Labour councillor Phil Bateman, but was eventually abandoned in late 1985 in the face of public opposition to demolishing hundreds of houses, and the Transport Executive was unable to find a member of parliament willing to sponsor an enabling Bill.

===1988 proposals===

Following the abolition of the West Midlands County Council and establishment of a new Passenger Transport Authority in 1986, a new light-rail scheme under the name &quot;Midland Metro&quot; was revived with a different set of lines. The first of up to 15 lines was intended to be operating by the end of 1993, and a network of 200 kilometres was planned to be in use by 2000.

In February 1988, it was announced that the first route, Line 1, would be between Birmingham and Wolverhampton, using much of the mothballed trackbed of the former Birmingham Snow Hill to Wolverhampton Low Level Line, a route not included in the 1984 recommended network, partly as at that stage the section between Wednesbury and Bilston was still in use, not closing until 1992. The Wednesbury to Birmingham section had closed back in 1972, and the section between Bilston and Wolverhampton was last used in 1983.

A Bill to give West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive powers to build the line was deposited in Parliament in November 1988, and became an Act of Parliament a year later, with completion expected by the mid-1990s.

A three-line network was initially planned, and powers were also obtained to build two further routes. Firstly an extension of Line 1 through the city centre to Five Ways, then a second line, Midland Metro Line 2, running to Chelmsley Wood, and then Birmingham Airport. A third line, Line 3 was also proposed, running from Line 1 at Wolverhampton to Walsall, using much of the disused trackbed of the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway, and then, using the Wednesbury to Brierley Hill trackbed of the South Staffordshire Line (which would close in 1993), running southwards to Dudley intersecting with Line 1 along the route. This would provide a direct link with the new Merry Hill Shopping Centre, which was built between 1984 and 1989.

===Construction of Line 1===
During August 1995, a 25-year contract for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of Line 1 was awarded to the Altram consortium; construction commenced three months later. The estimated construction cost in 1995 was £145 million () of which loans and grants from central government accounted for £80M, the European Regional Development Fund contributed £31M, while the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority provided £17.1M and Altram contributed £11.4M.

By May 1997, construction work was reportedly 50 per cent complete and track-laying had been progressing at 0.5 km per week. However, the targeted completion date of August 1998 was missed by ten months, leading to compensation being paid by Altram. The original part of Line 1, Birmingham to Wolverhampton, was opened on 30 May 1999.

===Further development===
Some 25 years later, Line 2 and Line 3 have not been built. In 1997, Centro accepted that they were unable to get funding for the proposed lines, and therefore adopted a strategy of expanding the system in &quot;bite-sized chunks&quot;, with the city-centre extension of Line 1 as the first priority. The intention was that the first decade of the 21st century would see the completion of the first of these projects.

Work on the Birmingham Metro tram extension began in June 2012, launched by transport minister Norman Baker. The dig was begun at the junction of Corporation Street and Bull Street, with work to move water pipes and power cables. On 6 December 2015, trams entered service on the extension to Bull Street.

==Current network==
===Route===
For nearly two decades, Line 1 between Birmingham to Wolverhampton was the solitary operating section of the Midland Metro. It runs mostly along the trackbed of the former Great Western Railway line between the two cities which was closed in phases between 1972 and 1992. The line originally terminated at Birmingham Snow Hill station, using one of the former rail platforms. Between 2015 and 2016 the line was extended across Birmingham city centre as far as Grand Central. From December 2019, trams terminated at Library tram stop next to the Library of Birmingham, and in July 2022 the line was further extended to Edgbaston Village.

From Grand Central, which allows interchange with the National Rail network at Birmingham New Street station, West Midlands Metro then runs on streets through the city centre to Birmingham Snow Hill station. From there, the line runs north-west, and for the first few miles it runs alongside the Birmingham to Worcester railway line, before the two diverge. Two stations on this stretch (Jewellery Quarter and The Hawthorns) are also tram/railway interchange stations.

At the northern end of the route trams leave the railway trackbed at Priestfield to run along Bilston Road to Wolverhampton St George&#x27;s. From September 2023 trams terminate at Wolverhampton station instead although the original terminus remains open.

The original proposal was to run into the former Wolverhampton Low Station but this was abandoned as the terminus would be too remote from the city centre. A loop around the city centre was also planned but this has not been implemented.

===Stops===

There are 33 tram stops in use on the route.

===Frequencies===
Mondays to Saturdays, services run at ten-minute intervals during the day. Sunday day service is twelve-minute intervals and all Evening service is at fifteen-minute intervals. Trams take roughly 55 minutes to complete the route.

==Rolling stock==
===Current fleet===
West Midlands Metro operates 42 trams, with more on option. In summary:

In February 2012, Centro announced that it was planning a £44.2million replacement of the entire existing T-69 tram fleet. CAF was named preferred bidder for 19 to 25 Urbos 3 trams. A£40million order for 20 was signed, with options for five more. The new fleet provided an increased service of ten trams per hour in each direction, with an increased capacity of 210 passengers per tram (compared to 156 passengers on the T69 trams).

The first four new trams entered service on 5 September 2014; all of the T-69s had been replaced by August 2015.

In October 2019, WMCA awarded CAF a contract to supply an additional 21 Urbos 3 trams worth £83.5million for the expanding network, with the option to purchase a further 29. The contract includes technical support and battery management services over 30years.

Cracks were found in a couple of the new trams during routine inspection in June 2021 leading to all services being briefly suspended. Services were suspended again in November 2021 for four weeks as further inspections had discovered that more significant permanent repairs were required.

The service was suspended again on 20 March 2022 for replacement of body panels and recommenced on 9 June 2022.

===Former fleet===
West Midlands Metro has previously operated the following trams:

====T-69====
The T-69s were built in Italy by AnsaldoBreda (now Hitachi Rail Italy), and were used only on the Midland Metro (as it was called then).
After withdrawal, all 16 were transferred to the tram test centre at Long Marston.

==Infrastructure==

===Track===
The West Midlands Metro is a standard-gauge double-track tramway. Trams are driven manually under a mix of line-of-sight and signals. Turnback crossovers along the line, including in the street section, have point indicators.

On the trackbed section Birmingham to Priestfield, signals are at Black Lake level crossing, Wednesbury Parkway, and Metro Centre. The street section has signals at every set of traffic lights, tied into the road signals to allow tram priority.

===Tram stop design===
The tram stops are unstaffed raised platforms with two open-fronted cantilever shelters equipped with seats, a &#x27;live&#x27; digital display of services, closed-circuit television, and an intercom linked to Metro Centre.

===Power supply===
Some of the line is electrified at 750 V DC using overhead lines, and that system was renewed in 2010/11, requiring short-term closures. The current trams have batteries, and charge at specially adapted tram stops, eliminating the need for visible power infrastructure within certain city sections.

===Depot===
The Metro Centre control room, stabling point and depot is near Wednesbury Great Western Street tram stop, on land once used as railway sidings.

In January 2023, construction began to expand the depot.

==Fares and ticketing==
Unlike many other tram and train networks in the UK, West Midlands Metro does not offer ticket machines or ticket offices at tram stops although machines were provided when the system opened. They were later replaced by conductors. Single, return, and all-day tickets are sold by the on-tram conductors. Tickets valid for 1, 4, or 52 weeks are sold from seven &quot;Travel Shops&quot; located around the West Midlands, though only four are in locations served by the Metro.

Up until 2018 single, return, and day tickets could only be purchased with cash or Swift cards, but Contactless payment cards are now accepted. 

As well as the above, West Midlands Metro accepts a range of interavailable Transport for West Midlands (TfWM) tickets such as nbus+Metro and , which can be bought on buses and at railway stations, as well as on the trams.

Cash fares were distance-related. The scale was originally intended to be broadly comparable with buses, but this caused the system to run at a significant loss and fares rose. In January 2013, the adult single fare from Birmingham to Wolverhampton was £2 by bus and £3.60 by tram, although the tram journey is much quicker even when the bus routes are congestion-free. By 2016 the tram fare had risen to £4. In November 2013, Birmingham City Council indicated plans to introduce a smart-card system (similar to Transport for London&#x27;s Oyster card) to improve access, alongside a range of measures including a new Tube-style map and electric bus networks. This has now launched and is called the Swift card.

In March 2022, the fare system was amended again, with the graduated fares replaced by four zones:

* &quot;Zone 1&quot; – Edgbaston Village to Jewellery Quarter (Birmingham City Centre)
* &quot;Zone 2&quot; – Jewellery Quarter to Black Lake
* &quot;Zone 3&quot; – Black Lake to Priestfield
* &quot;Zone 4&quot; – Priestfield to Wolverhampton station (Wolverhampton City Centre)

Fares are now charged on a per-zone basis, with fares payable for travel in Zone 1 slightly higher than Zones 2-4 (this applies to single zone, two zone and three zone fares). The stops at Jewellery Quarter, Black Lake and Priestfield are &quot;boundary stations&quot;, meaning they sit in both zones.

==Corporate affairs==
===Operator===
When the Midland Metro system opened in 1999, it was originally operated by Altram, a joint venture of the infrastructure company John Laing, the engineering firm Ansaldo, and the transport group National Express. During 2006, Ansaldo and Laing officially withdrew from the venture after financial difficulties, and day-to-day operation was taken over by the remaining partner, National Express, who ran the system as National Express Midland Metro.

In October 2018, the National Express concession ended and the system was taken over by Transport for West Midlands, the transport arm of the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA). Operation of Midland Metro was taken over by Midland Metro Ltd, a company wholly owned by WMCA, and the system was rebranded &quot;West Midlands Metro&quot;. WMCA subsequently set up a consortium of various engineering and consultancy firms, the Midland Metro Alliance, to design and construct future network extensions.

===Business trends===
The current operator, Midland Metro, has produced accounts from 1 October 2017. Between 1999 and 2003, Altram had operated Midland Metro unsuccessfully on a for-profit basis. However, operating revenue did not cover costs, and in February 2003, auditors refused to sign off Midland Metro&#x27;s accounts as a going concern. From 2006, under sole National Express control, losses were largely covered by cross-subsidy from other parts of the National Express group, but the figures were not shown separately in their published accounts.

Passenger revenue and passenger numbers are published by the Department for Transport.

The key available trends in recent years for West Midlands Metro are (years ending 31 March):
===Passenger numbers===
Detailed passenger journeys since the system commenced operations on 30 May 1999 were:

Usage on the initial line averaged about five million passenger journeys annually, but numbers remained static for many years. This was not seen as successful, as 14 to 20million passengers per year had been projected.

Numerous reasons were suggested for the underperformance, including: that the line has lacked visibility, being confined to Snow Hill station at the edge of Birmingham city centre; that there are quicker trains running between Birmingham and Wolverhampton; that the line did not serve New Street station or any of Birmingham&#x27;s major visitor attractions (except for the Jewellery Quarter, already well-served by suburban trains). Nonetheless, overcrowding sometimes occurred on trams at peak hours.

Passenger numbers increased sharply following the opening of the extension into Birmingham city centre in June 2016, with figures for 2016/17 exceeding six million for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;16/17DfTstats&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Branding and livery===

The original Midland Metro branding consisted of a blue, green and red livery on tram vehicles with yellow doors. Upon the change to National Express operation in 2006, Midland Metro was rebranded with Network West Midlands livery, then a sub-brand of the transport authority Centro, and trams were painted in a magenta and silver livery with blue doors.

Since 2017, West Midlands Metro has adopted shared branding with other transport modes consisting of a common hexagonal logo formed from the letters &quot;WM&quot;. This common brand has been introduced in order to create a common identity for an integrated transport system for the region. Each mode bears a coloured variant of the logo: blue for trams, red for buses, orange for trains, magenta for roads, purple for taxis and green for cycling and walking initiatives. The primary typeface is LL Circular by Lineto.

==Expansion plans==
The Midland Metro Alliance was set up in 2017 by WMCA as a long-term framework agreement with transport contractors Colas Rail, Barhale, Thomas Vale, Auctus Management Group, Egis Rail, Tony Gee and Pell Frischman to design and construct future extensions of the West Midlands Metro system.

Continuing on from the original route (Line 1), two extensions in three phases have since been opened in Birmingham:

* The Birmingham City Centre extension was completed in 2015 and opened in 2016, roughly coinciding with the opening of a renovated Birmingham New Street station. This moved the Birmingham terminus (and primary interchange) from Snow Hill to New Street, located on Stephenson Street and called Grand Central.
* The Birmingham Westside extension was constructed in two phases. Phase 1, which extended the line from New Street to Birmingham Library, opened in 2019. Phase 2, which extended the line from the Library to Edgbaston Village near Five Ways, opened in 2022.

The Birmingham Eastside extension is currently under construction. This new branch line, diverging between Bull Street and Corporation Street tram stops, is expected to open with a temporary terminus at Moor Street Queensway in 2025 or 2026 until track can be laid on the site of HS2&#x27;s Curzon Street terminus. Work on the extension has been completed on the other side of the site, continuing to Digbeth.

The Wolverhampton city centre extension was completed in September 2023. The same opening date was given for a new line from Wednesbury to Brierley Hill through Dudley Town Centre; this is scheduled to open in 2024.


===Birmingham extensions===
====Birmingham City Centre extension====

Until 2015, the southern end of the Metro line terminated at Snow Hill station, on the periphery of Birmingham city centre. From its inception, Midland Metro had failed to attain projected passenger numbers and to operate at a profit, and this was attributed to the fact that the line could not carry passengers all the way into the urban centre. The Birmingham City Centre Extension (BCCE) was conceived to solve this problem by extending the route into the streets of central Birmingham.

This extension serves to facilitate the expansion of the metro network through Birmingham&#x27;s Eastside and Westside. Originally it was planned to terminate the extension at Stephenson Street, adjacent to New Street railway station, but the plans were revised to continue the extension to Birmingham Library, and eventually as far as Five Ways. A Transport and Works Order authorising the BCCE was made in July 2005, and Government approval was given in February 2012. A new fleet of trams and a new depot at Wednesbury were also authorised, with a budget of £128million, of which £75million was to be funded by the Department for Transport (DfT). Extension works began in June 2012. The first phase of the extension, to Bull Street, was completed in December 2015; it was the first time in 62 years that trams were serving passengers on the streets of central Birmingham.

The extension from to was completed in 2016. This extension used a new route to the east of Snow Hill station which diverged from the original line along a new viaduct and descended to street level. The former tram terminus inside Snow Hill station was closed, releasing a fourth platform at Snow Hill to be reinstated for mainline railway use although , little work has been carried out at the former terminus. Interchange between National Rail services and trams is now provided at , approximately from Snow Hill station. From Snow Hill a new tramway was built along Colmore Circus, Upper Bull Street, Corporation Street, and Stephenson Place, terminating at . This opened on 30 May 2016. A temporary reversing spur was built in Stephenson Street to allow trams to turn back for the return journey to Wolverhampton. On 19 November 2015, The Queen visited Birmingham and named one of the new trams. Despite only being in use for five years, this track and the concrete trackbed was removed and replaced in May 2021.

====Birmingham Westside extension====

The extension from Grand Central to Library began on 5 September 2017. and was opened to passenger service in December 2019. Trams now run from Stephenson Street along Pinfold Street, through Victoria Square with a new stop at Town Hall, along Paradise Street and Broad Street, and terminated at Library in Centenary Square until 16 July 2022.

The Birmingham Westside extension will continue the line from Birmingham Library along Broad Street to Hagley Road in Edgbaston (just west of Five Ways). Additional local enterprise partnership funding was made available in 2014 for the extension from Five Ways to . The extension opened in July 2022 with new tram stops at , , and .

====Birmingham Eastside extension====

In November 2013, Centro announced a proposal for a tram or bus rapid transit route from Birmingham city centre to Coventry, with a loop connecting the Birmingham Airport with Birmingham city centre via Small Heath and Lea Hall, and a line to , however Coventry may be connected to the Metro by a line of the Coventry Very Light Rail, which is planned to terminate at Birmingham Interchange HS2. The line would also serve the planned High Speed 2 interchange at . In February 2014, it was announced that funding had been secured for the first phase of the Line 2 Eastside extension as far as Curzon Street, before a terminus at Adderley Street.

The new route will branch off from the existing route at a junction at meeting point of Bull St and Corporation St. In 2014, Centro considered two proposed routes, one running via Bull Street and Carrs Lane and serving Moor Street station, and a more direct route via Bull Street and Albert Street, bypassing Moor Street.

A Transport and Works Act application was submitted by the Metro Alliance for the first phase of the Eastside extension, following the route via Albert Street and Curzon Street and terminating at Digbeth.

Construction of the first part of the Eastside extension, including a new tramway junction at Lower Bull St and Corporation St, began in June 2021. The first phase of the works involved utility upgrades and diversions in the area. The closure of Lower Bull Street was expected to be in place until Spring 2022, but the street reopened in July 2023. As of 2024, construction is underway from Bull Street to Digbeth, via the HS2 Curzon Street station. Plans are also in place for the extension to be partially opened in 2025 or 2026 up to Moor Street Queensway.

====East Birmingham to Solihull extension====

The East Birmingham to Solihull extension (EBSE) was originally investigated in 2004 as a route to Birmingham Airport and National Exhibition Centre, serving suburbs along the A45. Journey time from central Birmingham (Bull Street) to the airport was estimated at 29minutes. This proposal has now been incorporated into the proposals for an expansion beyond the Digbeth terminus of the Eastside extension.

As of March 2024, the route is planned to continue eastwards by approximately to serve north Solihull via the B4128 to terminate at the HS2 Birmingham Interchange station, allowing passenger access by West Midlands Metro to the airport, National Exhibition Centre, Resorts World, and Resorts World Arena when open for passenger service. The proposed route would also pass directly by St Andrew&#x27;s Stadium, home of Birmingham City FC, intended as an alternative to Bordesley station.

===Wolverhampton extensions===
====Wolverhampton City Centre extension====

The northern part of the extension scheme was the addition of a tram line into Wolverhampton city centre. The laying of the new track was completed in December 2019 and it was anticipated that passenger services would commence in 2021 once the renovation of Wolverhampton railway station has been completed. However, the project has been delayed.

It was originally proposed in 2009 as a single-track loop running clockwise from the existing St George&#x27;s terminus via Princess Street, Lichfield Street and Pipers Row (for Wolverhampton bus station), with a spur to Wolverhampton station. An earlier plan would have served more of the city centre with the loop running along Lichfield Street, Queen Square, Victoria Street, Cleveland Street and Garrick Street to the Wolverhampton St George&#x27;s tram stop. The 2009 scheme had an estimated cost of £30million. In 2010 Centro considered revised proposals that involved an extended route along part of the Wolverhampton Ring Road, serving the University of Wolverhampton campus. The original loop scheme was selected and in 2012 Centro decided to proceed by constructing it in phases. A Transport and Works Act Order was approved in 2016, and in March 2014, a £2billion connectivity funding package was announced to support a number of transport projects, including phase 1 of the Wolverhampton extension.

The first phase will see the construction of the eastern section of the Wolverhampton loop, consisting of a line branching off before the existing St George&#x27;s terminus and running north up Pipers Row to terminate at the station. Northbound trams will terminate alternately at the station and at St George&#x27;s. The estimated completion date was 2015, although a succession of delays means that this section actually opened on 17 September 2023. The remaining part of the Wolverhampton loop will be completed at a later date, subject to funding.

===Wednesbury–Brierley Hill extension===
Wednesbury–Brierley Hill extension (WBHE) is an line which will run south-west from the existing route, branching off east of . The route would be constructed on the track bed of the disused South Staffordshire Line, running through Tipton and close to the former Dudley Town station. The line would then run on-street into Dudley town centre, before following the A461 Southern Bypass to rejoin the railway corridor. After running along part of the former Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Line, the tram line would diverge south to serve the Waterfront Business Park and Merry Hill Shopping Centre, terminating at Brierley Hill. In 2012, the estimated cost of the WBHE was £268million, and a frequency of ten trams per hour was envisaged, alternately serving Wolverhampton and Birmingham. A further extension to Stourbridge has also been proposed, with a junction at Canal Street, allowing trams to access the remainder of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Line to Stourbridge Junction and possibly Stourbridge Town.

Network Rail have announced plans to reopen the South Staffordshire Line for the use of freight trains. Metro planners considered operating light rail trams on segregated tracks, but in 2011 put forward proposals to introduce tram-train operation on the route to allow Metro vehicles to share tracks with heavy rail freight trains.

Due to funding constraints, it was decided to construct this extension in phases, with the first section from Wednesbury to Dudley opening first.

In early 2017, work began to clear vegetation and disused track from the former railway line. In early 2021, work started on construction of the line. It was estimated that the entire line to Brierley Hill would be completed by 2023. The estimated cost of the extension is now £449million. In July 2022, it was announced that due to spiralling costs, the line to Brierley Hill will be built in two phases. Phase 1 will see a line open to Dudley, construction of which is well underway. Phase 2 will extend the line to Brierley Hill and construction started in February 2025, estimated to cost £295 million.

===Other new lines===
In September 2021, £2.1billion in funding was applied for, of which £1billion was received, for new Metro and upgraded bus routes around the West Midlands, consisting of many new lines and extensions, these are:
* Extension from Edgbaston to Quinton
** This may be cut or extended depending on how much funding is given
* Extension from Brierley Hill to Stourbridge Junction
* New Line from Walsall to Wednesbury (offering two routes to Birmingham)
* New Line to New Cross Hospital
** This would likely be an extension of the line to Wolverhampton Railway Station.
*Possible New Line branching off the Airport Line to Solihull Town Centre
** First part under construction as part of the Birmingham Eastside Metro Extension, from Bull Street to Digbeth.

===Historic planned extensions===
In 2004, the proposed Phase Two expansion included five routes:

;Birmingham City Centre to Great Barr
:A , 17-stop route from the city centre through Lancaster Circus and along the A34 corridor to the Birmingham/Walsall boundary, terminating near the M6 motorway junction 7. Transport for the West Midlands have since decided that a &quot;West Midlands Sprint&quot; concept, based on bus rapid transit is the way forward for this route.

;Birmingham City Centre to Quinton
:A route from the BCCE terminus at Five Ways along the Hagley Road to Quinton.

;Wolverhampton City Centre to Wednesfield, Willenhall, Walsall and Wednesbury
:This &quot;5Ws&quot; route would connect Wolverhampton city centre to Wednesfield, Willenhall, Walsall and Wednesbury, and provide direct access to New Cross and Manor Hospitals, partially using the trackbed of the former Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway. This link was officially declared dead in the Express &amp; Star on 23 October 2015. In place of this line, restoration of passenger services along the railway line between Wolverhampton and Walsall including new stations at Willenhall and Darlaston (James Bridge) was proposed.

;Birmingham Airport links
:*via the A45 (now part of the East Birmingham to Solihull extension scheme).
:*via the A47: In September 2010, the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; reported that a &quot;£425million rapid transit system&quot; between Birmingham city centre and the airport &quot;could involve a new light rail scheme&quot;. Centro strategy director Alex Burrows stated &quot;the Birmingham City Centre to Birmingham Airport Rapid Transit plan will provide connectivity between the city centre, Birmingham Business Park and Chelmsley Wood&quot;.

During the mid-2000s, Birmingham City Council also evaluated the possibility of constructing an underground railway, and the scheme was advocated by the leader of the council, Mike Whitby, and deputy leader of the council, Paul Tilsley. A feasibility report by Jacobs Engineering and Deloitte concluded that the tunnelling scheme would be unaffordable and not meet government funding criteria.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 8 June 2006, T-69 tram, fleet number 06, collided with a taxi on New Swan Lane Level Crossing. The taxi was pushed across the junction and collided with a stationary lorry. The two occupants of the taxi were taken to hospital and released after two hours; neither the tram passengers nor the lorry driver suffered any injuries. The RAIB enquiry found that the tram driver failed to stop at the signal; the report noted that this was then the only level crossing on the network, and that there had been seven previous collisions there since the metro came into operation in 1999, but all of these had been a result of failures by road traffic users.
* On 19 December 2006, trams 09 and 10 collided in Winson Green, injuring a group of people while en route to the Metro&#x27;s then Birmingham Snow Hill terminus.
* On 19 August 2019, tram 31 was derailed after colliding with a vehicle in Wolverhampton.
* On 11 June 2021, all 21 tram cars were taken out of service &quot;after a fault was discovered.&quot; Services resumed step by step following Tuesday onwards. 
* On 13 November 2021, services were suspended again due to cracks being found in the bodywork of some more trams. The limitations in services lasted until 12 February 2022.
* On 20 March 2022, services were suspended until further notice due to even more cracks in the bodywork of some older trams.
* On 13 June 2024, a woman was seriously injured after being hit by a tram in West Bromwich.
* On 8 October 2024, a tram was derailed after colliding with a car in Wolverhampton.

<doc id="287255" wikidata="Q7627809" url="?curid=287255" title="Student and Exchange Visitor Program">
<text>The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) is a program within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, to manage foreign students and exchange visitors in the United States through the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The SEVP encompasses the F status (for foreign students in the United States in academic programs and their dependents), J status (for exchange visitors in the United States and their dependents), and M status (for foreign students in the United States in vocational programs and their dependents). The exchange visitor part of the program (J visa) is managed by the U.S. Department of State, although the SEVIS system is maintained by ICE.

The SEVP does not manage the issuance of the visas themselves. Visas are issued at United States consulates and embassies in other countries, which fall under the United States Department of State&#x27;s Bureau of Consular Affairs. However, having the correct status and information in the SEVIS system is necessary for a person to be able to receive a F, J, or M visa.

The SEVP does not cover some other statuses that can be used by foreign students in the United States, such as the H-4 status and other statuses for dependents of people in non-student statuses.

=== Pre-origins: CIPRIS ===
In the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, a truck bomb was detonated below the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. In the aftermath of this incident, the student visa came under increased scrutiny when it was discovered that Eyad Ismoil, one of the terrorists involved was in the United States on an expired student visa.

A memorandum from the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Office of Investigative Agency Policies to the Deputy Attorney General dated September 24, 1994, mentioned the need to subject foreign students to thorough and continuing scrutiny before and during their stay in the United States. On April 17, 1995, the Deputy Attorney General asked the INS Commissioner to address this issue. This led to the formation of an INS task force in June 1995 to conduct a comprehensive review of the F, M, and J visa processes. Besides the INS, the task force included members from the State Department and the United States Information Agency, and experts in the administration of international student programs. The task force report, issued on December 22, 1995, identified problems in the tracking and monitoring of students by schools, problems in the certification of schools by the INS, and problems with INS receiving and maintaining up-to-date records from schools. As a result of these findings, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 directed the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to develop and conduct a program to collect certain information on nonimmigrant foreign students and exchange visitors from approved institutions of higher education and designated exchange visitor programs.

In June 1997, the INS launched a pilot program for a centralized electronic reporting system for institutions, called the Coordinated Interagency Partnership Regulating International Students (CIPRIS). The CIPRIS pilot officially ended in October 1999, as the INS felt it had gathered enough data from the prototype to start working on the nationwide system. The INS began working on a new system that would be called the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) with the associated information system called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Service (SEVIS). During the rollout, CIPRIS and SEVIS met with considerable opposition from the and the American Council on Education. However, they claimed that the opposition was not against the programs in principle but due to the concern that a botched rollout by the INS could result in many students suffering.

=== Launch after the September 11 attacks ===
In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks (September 11, 2001) and the Patriot Act passed in response (October 26, 2001), there was further increase in scrutiny of student visas, increasing the momentum in favor of the adoption of SEVIS. This was partly because one of the attackers, Hani Hanjour, had come to the United States on a student visa.

Below is a timeline of the key events in the two years after the attacks describing the key steps in the evolution of SEVIS:

=== History of release versions ===
SEVIS has undergone six major releases since its launch. The release is numbered using a major release version number followed by a dot and a minor release version number. Below is a partial list of release dates:

During the first half of 2012, changes that affect all colleges, universities, and other educational institutions that provide English language training (&quot;ESL&quot;) programs began. These changes stem from the Accreditation of English Language Training Act (&quot;Accreditation Act&quot;), which became effective in June 2011. Pursuant to the Accreditation Act, ESL programs that enroll foreign nonimmigrant students must obtain accreditation from a regional or national accreditation agency recognized by the United States Department of Education. The Accreditation Act applies to two types of ESL programs: Stand-Alone ESL Schools whose officials have indicated on the school&#x27;s Form I-17 the intention to offer only ESL programs of study; and Combined Schools whose officials have indicated on the school&#x27;s Form I-17 that the school offers an ESL program of study, as well as other programs of study. A Combined School may either contract out the ESL program of study or wholly own and operate the ESL program of study under the institution&#x27;s governance.

=== Mandatory reporting requirements ===
Schools and programs approved to host students and scholars on these visas are required to report certain information. Information that must be reported includes:
* Change of legal name
* Change of U.S. address
* Change of major field of study
* Change of education degree level
* Change of funding
* Authorization for off-campus employment

In addition, they must report events that constitute a violation of the international visitor&#x27;s visa status, such as academic suspension, criminal conviction, failure to enroll and unauthorized off-campus employment.

=== COVID-19 pandemic change===
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the SEVP program allowed international students to take more online coursework in the spring and summer semesters of 2020 to accommodate the various state-mandated school closures and stay-at-home orders without penalizing the students. On July 6, 2020, ICE issued a regulation that stated that for any current international visitor under SEVP to remain in the country come the fall 2020 semesters, they must return to taking most of their coursework in person, limiting any online coursework to a maximum of one class or three credit hours online, or be enrolled in a hybrid system but still required to take some physical classes. Students failing to meet these would be face &quot;immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings&quot;, and students who had indicated they would be taking only online classes would be denied visas.

The new change was criticized by students, schools, and states alike, as with the pandemic worsening in most of the United States at the time, many schools did not have plans to commit to opening to physical classes in the fall semester, leaving these international students at risk of deportation. At least three separate lawsuits were filed against ICE on the changed within the week on the basis that the decision was arbitrary and capricious and failed the Administrative Procedure Act: A joint suit by Harvard University and MIT, the state of California, and a separate collation of 17 states and the District of Columbia. Prior to a second hearing where it was expected that a preliminary injunction was to be placed on the new ruling on July 14, 2020, ICE affirmed it would rescind the new rule and continue to allow international students to participate in online classes.

== Fee ==
=== Fee for students and exchange visitors ===
In 2004, the United States Congress mandated that all international students and exchange visitors pay the I-901 SEVIS fee, which funds the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) and SEVIS. The fee can be paid online at fmjfee.com. As of June 24, 2019, the fees are as follows:

The SEVIS fee must be paid after receiving the initial document (I-20 or DS-2019) and is a prerequisite for obtaining the F, J, or M visa, or if transitioning to student status using Form I-539.

The fee needs to be paid only for the principal (the F-1, J-1, or M-1). Dependents (F-2, J-2, and M-2) do not need to pay the fee. Also, the fee needs to be paid only once per initial SEVIS record, and in particular, does not need to be paid again if applying for a new visa on the same status. It is distinct from the visa fees, which need to be paid for each visa application.

=== Fee for schools seeking SEVP certification ===
Below is the list of fees for schools seeking SEVP certification (through Form I-17) or re-certification, as of January 2017.

<text>Uthai Thani (, ), one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) lies in lower northern Thailand. Neighbouring provinces are (from north clockwise) Nakhon Sawan, Chai Nat, Suphan Buri, Kanchanaburi and Tak. It lies somewhat off the route between Bangkok, 200 km distant and Chiang Mai.

==Geography==
The province stretches from the upper plains of the Chao Phraya River valley, to forested mountains in the west. The Sakae Krang River, a tributary of the Chao Phraya River, is the main watercourse of in the province.
The total forest area is or 51.4 percent of provincial area.&lt;br&gt;
The Huai Kha Khaeng wildlife sanctuary, at the western boundary bordering Tak province, was declared a World Heritage Site in 1991. It is home to most of the forest animals of Southeast Asia, including tigers and elephants.&lt;br&gt; 
Huai Kha Kaeng wildlife sanctuary, along with one other wildlife sanctuary, make up region 12 (Nakhon Sawan) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, 

==History==
Originally Mon and Lawa settled in the area. The first Thai settlement in the area was Muang U Thai during the Sukhothai Kingdom, but it was later abandoned when the river changed course. The Patabeut people, of Karen ethnicity, revived the settlement at its current site during the Ayutthaya Kingdom. It served as a fort protecting the boundary of the kingdom.

Uthai Thani is the hometown of the father of King Rama I. He later changed the city&#x27;s old name &quot;Uthai&quot; to &quot;Uthai Thani&quot;.

In 1892, King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) added the area of Uthai Thani to the Monthon Nakhon Sawan and in 1898 formed the province.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal depicts the pavilion at Wat Khao Sakae Krang. It houses the statue of Thongdee, the father of King Rama I and a Buddha footprint. The mountain in the background symbolizes the location of the pavilion on top of Khao Sakae Krang.

The provincial flower is the yellow cotton tree (&quot;Cochlospermum regium&quot;). The provincial tree is the neem (&quot;Azadirachta indica v. siamensis&quot;). Giant gourami (&quot;Osphronemus goramy&quot;) is the provincial aquatic animal.

The flag of Uthai Thani depicts the provincial seal of Uthai Thani in the middle. The yellow colour at the top of the flag is the colour of the Chakri dynasty, symbolizing gold. The green colour at the bottom is the colour of King Rama I as he was born on a Wednesday, which is associated with green in the Thai calendar. The text below the seal says &quot;Uthai Thani province&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===

The province is divided into eight districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). These are further divided into 70 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 642 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).


===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Uthai Thani Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 14 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Uthai Thani has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. There are a further 13 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 49 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations (SAO) (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

In 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand began tracking progress on human development at the sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="287264" wikidata="Q11695" url="?curid=287264" title="DEFCON">
<text>The defense readiness condition (DEFCON) is an alert state used by the United States Armed Forces. For security reasons, the US military does not announce a DEFCON level to the public.

The DEFCON system was developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and unified and specified combatant commands. It prescribes five graduated levels of readiness (or states of alert) for the U.S. military. It increases in severity from DEFCON 5 (least severe) to DEFCON 1 (most severe) to match varying military situations, with DEFCON 1 signaling the impending outbreak of nuclear warfare.

DEFCONs are a subsystem of a series of &quot;Alert Conditions&quot;, or LERTCONs, which also include Emergency Conditions (EMERGCONs).

==Definition==
The DEFCON level is controlled primarily by the U.S. president and the U.S. Secretary of Defense through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commanders; each level defines specific security, activation and response scenarios for the personnel in question.

Different branches of the U.S. Armed Forces (i.e. U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Space Force) and different bases or command groups can be activated at different defense conditions. According to &quot;Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian&quot;, , the U.S. DEFCON level has never been more severe than DEFCON 3. The DEFCON 2 levels in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and 1991 Gulf War applied only to the U.S. Strategic Air Command (SAC).

DEFCONs should not be confused with similar systems used by the US military, such as Force Protection Conditions (FPCONS), Readiness Conditions (REDCONS), Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) and its future replacement Cyber Operations Condition (CYBERCON), and Watch Conditions (WATCHCONS), or the former Homeland Security Advisory System used by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Although a higher DEFCON number refers to a more relaxed defence posture, the term has been misused in popular culture in which &quot;DEFCON 5&quot; is incorrectly used to describe an active conflict situation (such as in the title of the video game &quot;Defcon 5&quot;), or more figuratively, to describe an aggravated state of mind (&quot;going to DEFCON five&quot;).

==Levels==
Defense readiness conditions vary between many commands and have changed over time, and the United States Department of Defense uses exercise terms when referring to the DEFCON levels during exercises. This is to prevent confusing exercise commands with actual operational commands.

On January 12, 1966, NORAD &quot;proposed the adoption of the readiness conditions of the JCS system&quot;, and information about the levels was declassified in 2006:
==History==
After NORAD was created, the command used different readiness levels (Normal, Increased, Maximum) subdivided into eight conditions, e.g., the &quot;Maximum Readiness&quot; level had two conditions &quot;Air Defense Readiness&quot; and &quot;Air Defense Emergency&quot;. In October 1959, the JCS Chairman informed NORAD &quot;that Canada and the U.S. had signed an agreement on increasing the operational readiness of NORAD forces during periods of international tension.&quot; After the agreement became effective on October 2, 1959, the JCS defined a system with DEFCONs in November 1959 for the military commands. The initial DEFCON system had &quot;Alpha&quot; and &quot;Bravo&quot; conditions (under DEFCON 3) and Charlie/Delta under DEFCON 4, plus an &quot;Emergency&quot; level higher than DEFCON 1 with two conditions: &quot;Defense Emergency&quot; and the highest, &quot;Air Defense Emergency&quot; (&quot;Hot Box&quot; and &quot;Big Noise&quot; for exercises).

The United States has never declared a readiness condition of DEFCON 1 to prepare for nuclear war.

== Instances of DEFCON 2 or 3 ==

===DEFCON 2===

====Cuban Missile Crisis====
During the Cuban Missile Crisis on October 16–28, 1962, the U.S. Armed Forces (with the exception of United States Army Europe (USAREUR)) were ordered to DEFCON 3. On October 24, Strategic Air Command (SAC) was ordered to DEFCON 2, while the rest of the U.S. Armed Forces remained at DEFCON 3. SAC remained at DEFCON 2 until November 15. While at DEFCON 2, 92.5% of SAC&#x27;s weapons systems (approx. 1,479 strike aircraft; 182 Atlas, Titan, and Minuteman missiles; 2,962 total nuclear weapons; and 1,003 refueling tankers) were ready to launch within one hour, while its airborne alert program expanded to include 1/8th of SAC&#x27;s bomber forces, allowing an average of 65 planes in the air in position to be directed at targets in the Soviet Union at any given time.

===DEFCON 3===

====Yom Kippur War====
On October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria launched a joint attack on Israel resulting in the Yom Kippur War. The United States became concerned that the Soviet Union might intervene, and on October 25, US forces, including Strategic Air Command, Continental Air Defense Command, European Command and the Sixth Fleet, were placed at DEFCON 3.

According to documents declassified in 2016, the move to DEFCON 3 was motivated by CIA reports indicating that the Soviet Union had sent a ship to Egypt carrying nuclear weapons along with two other amphibious vessels. Soviet troops never landed and the declassified documents did not disclose the fate of the ship and its cargo.

Over the following days, the various forces reverted to normal status with the Sixth Fleet standing down on November 17.

====Operation Paul Bunyan====

Following the axe murder incident at Panmunjom on August 18, 1976, readiness levels for US forces in South Korea were increased to DEFCON 3, where they remained throughout Operation Paul Bunyan.

====September 11 attacks====
During the September 11 attacks, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ordered the DEFCON level be increased to 3, and also a stand-by for a possible increase to DEFCON 2. It was lowered to DEFCON 4 on September 14.

<text>The United States Army Pacific (USARPAC) is an Army Service Component Command which serves as the Army service component for United States Indo-Pacific Command. It may also serve as a Joint Task Force headquarters. The command has forces in Alaska, Hawaii, Japan, and South Korea. It also performs missions in Southeast Asia, in the countries stretching from the Philippines all the way to Bangladesh and India. United States Forces Korea (USFK) has had operational command and control of US Forces in Korea since January 2012, and USARPAC headquarters oversees the manning, training, and equipping of US Army forces assigned to USFK.

However, subordinate units of this command sometimes perform humanitarian missions in places such as Haiti, Cuba, and the Middle East.

==History==
USARPAC traces its lineage back to 1898 when the United States became a major power in the Pacific. In 1921 Fort Shafter became the headquarters for the Hawaiian Department. When the United States entered World War II, the Hawaiian Department became subordinate to the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas.

===History of designations===
Throughout its history the command was designated:

* US Army Forces, Central Pacific Area (1943–44)
* US Army Forces, Pacific Ocean Areas (1944–69)
* US Army Forces, Middle Pacific (1945–47)
* US Army, Pacific (1947–1974)
* US Army Western Command (1979–1990)
* United States Army Pacific (1990–present)

===Historical summary===
During the Korean War, USARPAC provided combat forces, training, and logistics.

During the Vietnam War, the command provided the same support to United States Army Vietnam. After the war the Army cut its presence in the region as there was no longer a need for such a large number of combat forces in the Pacific. Subsequently, USARPAC was eliminated as a component command and Army forces in Korea and Japan became separate major commands. In Hawaii, USARPAC headquarters was superseded by US Army Support Command Hawaii (USASCH) and a Department of the Army field operating agency, US Army CINCPAC Support Group.

In 1979 the Army established US Army Western Command (WESTCOM) as a major command and the Army component of US Pacific Command. WESTCOM took command of Army forces in Hawaii. In 1989 it added United States Army Alaska and in 1990 United States Army, Japan. In 1990 WESTCOM was renamed USARPAC. USARPAC has sent forces on multiple humanitarian missions, disaster relief, and defense support of civil authorities.

In October 2000 the headquarters reorganized as a multi-component Army service component command.

Since 9/11, the command plays a major role in the homeland defense of the United States. The command has also sent soldiers in support of the Global War on Terrorism to fill operational gaps.

The command insignia was designed in 1944. It depicts the axis of advance of U.S. forces across the pacific.

Former units include the U.S. Army Chemical Activity, Pacific, at Johnston Atoll, which traced some of its history to the 267th Chemical Company and the Project 112 biological warfare defense experiments. This became the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System, which was finally deactivated in 2001.

<doc id="287289" wikidata="Q2746987" url="?curid=287289" title="It Ain't Half Hot Mum">
<text>It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum is a British television sitcom about a Royal Artillery concert party based in Deolali in British India and the fictional village of Tin Min in Burma, during the final months of the Second World War. It was written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft, who had both served in similar roles in India during that war.

Fifty-six episodes were broadcast across eight series on BBC1 between 1974 and 1981, covering a real-time historical period of approximately thirteen weeks. Each episode ran for thirty minutes. The title originates from the first episode, in which young Gunner Parkin (Christopher Mitchell) writes home to his mother in England. In 1975, a recording of &quot;Whispering Grass&quot; performed by Don Estelle and Windsor Davies in character as Gunner &quot;Lofty&quot; Sugden and Sergeant Major Williams (respectively), reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart and remained there for three weeks.

The series, which attracted up to seventeen million viewers in its heyday, has been accused of racism, homophobia and a pro-imperialist attitude. One specific criticism has been the casting of a white actor, Michael Bates, as an Indian character, with darkening makeup that some have described as brownface.

==Premise==
Set in 1945, the series follows a Royal Artillery concert party during the final months of the Second World War. The main characters are performers in the base&#x27;s concert party; their duties involve performing comic acts and musical numbers (similar to those seen in a music hall) for other soldiers prior to their departure for the front lines. The concert party prevents the soldiers from partaking in combat duty; thus, the soldiers love being part of the outfit. Some even daydream of becoming world-famous actors when they leave the army.

Many songs of the era were performed by the cast in their re-enactment of wartime variety shows.

== Production ==

=== Development and casting ===
&quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; is set in 1945 during the final months of the Second World War, in the period after the German surrender, when the Allies were attempting to finish the war by defeating Japan in Asia. The scripts make clear that the performers are members of a concert party of the Royal Artillery and are thus enlisted soldiers, rather than being members of ENSA. Initially, the British soldiers are stationed at the Royal Artillery Depot in Deolali, British India, where soldiers were kept before being sent to fight at the front lines. The series was based on the experiences of its creators during the Second World War; Jimmy Perry, aged nineteen, had been a member of a Royal Artillery concert party in Deolali, India, while David Croft had been an entertainments officer in Poona (now in the Indian state of Maharashtra).

The characters in the series were based on colleagues co-writer Jimmy Perry knew while stationed in Deolali as a Royal Artillery concert party member. Perry recalled: &quot;I assure you that all those wonderful characters were based on real people in that concert party. They know who they are!&quot; The character of Battery Sergeant Major Williams, played by Windsor Davies, was based on Perry&#x27;s own Battery Sergeant Major; according to Perry, Davies&#x27;s character was less harsh than Perry&#x27;s own Sergeant had been.

George Layton left his previous show in which he wrote and starred, &quot;Doctor in Charge&quot;, to appear as Bombardier &quot;Solly&quot; Solomons in &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;. In 1975, after two series, Layton left to pursue other interests. Michael Bates, who played Indian bearer Rangi Ram, died after the fifth series had been broadcast. The part of chai wallah Muhammad, played by Dino Shafeek, was increased as a result.

=== Music ===
The theme song, &quot;Meet the Gang&quot;, was written and composed by Jimmy Perry and Derek Taverner. Two singles were released, featuring songs performed in-character by Don Estelle and Windsor Davies. The first, &quot;Whispering Grass&quot;, reached No. 1 in the British singles chart for three weeks from 7 June 1975. The second, &quot;Paper Doll&quot;, reached No. 41 later that year. They also recorded a top 10 LP titled &quot;Sing Lofty&quot;.

==Characters==

===Officers===
*Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Arthur Digby St John Reynolds (Donald Hewlett)
Lieutenant-Colonel Reynolds is the most senior officer in charge of the concert party and enjoys their shows immensely. He thinks army life in Asia is very hard, while all he does is sit around sipping pink gin and dining with the elite. He is having an affair with Daphne Waddilove-Evans, whose husband, Major Waddilove-Evans, has left for the Punjab. He is a stereotypical British Army officer, with a &quot;stiff upper lip&quot; and prim and proper manner. Captain Ashwood&#x27;s utter stupidity does occasionally infuriate him, but he is effectively good-natured and tries at all costs to avoid losing the easy life he has. Reynolds is revealed to be a solicitor in civilian life.
*Captain Jonathan Tarquin &quot;Tippy&quot; Ashwood (Michael Knowles)
Captain Ashwood is an even bigger fan of the concert party than Colonel Reynolds, especially when they dress up as girls. He is not very bright, and often unknowingly ruins other people&#x27;s plans, especially the Sergeant Major&#x27;s. His catchphrase is &quot;It&#x27;s a tricky one, sir&quot;, which he says in reply to Colonel Reynolds asking for his opinion when the concert party runs into a particular problem. He occasionally writes skits for the concert party, which they reluctantly accept, although they are, on the whole, of very low quality. He has absolutely no military bearing, which makes it very easy for the Sergeant Major and the others to manipulate him into using his authority to achieve their own ends. He is known for his stupidity, high-pitched voice, and love of gardening. He is exceptionally devoted to his wife, Fiona, though he does at one point have a fling with a local girl.

===Warrant officer===
*Battery Sergeant Major Tudor Bryn &quot;Shut Up&quot; Williams (Windsor Davies)
The Sergeant Major is the only professional soldier among the concert party and its officers. He is extremely bigoted in his views, making every effort to bully the Indian camp staff and remind everyone of British supremacy in Asia. He has only one goal in life: to get his soldiers posted up the jungle and into action as fast as he can. Williams has a cunning and fierce pirate-like look. He is disgusted that his soldiers &quot;prance about&quot; on the stage wearing dresses and make-up all the time, and frequently calls them a &quot;lot of poofs&quot;. He is sometimes portrayed as a stereotypical &quot;devious&quot; Welshman, using cunning schemes to turn events in his favour. He dislikes all members of the concert party, apart from Parkin, whom he believes to be his son. He has a particular loathing for &quot;Lah-Di-Dah&quot; Gunner Graham, owing to Graham&#x27;s university education, although Williams will praise him for it if it serves his purposes. Williams often mispronounces long words, turning &quot;hysterical&quot; into &quot;historical&quot; or &quot;hysterectical&quot;, &quot;misapprehension&quot; into &quot;mishappropriation&quot;, &quot;education&quot; into &quot;heducation&quot; and &quot;ignorant&quot; into &quot;higorant&quot;. Williams also has a tendency to roar &quot;Shut up!&quot; when he hears something that meets his disapproval, hence his nickname, and is also remembered for his sarcastic remark, &quot;Oh dear, how sad, never mind!&quot; invariably delivered in a flat monotone. He plans, when at some future time he should leave the army, to marry a widow who owns a pub.

(In one episode, a letter addressed to Gunner Parkin and intended to be opened only in the event of the Sergeant Major&#x27;s death falls into the hands of the Concert Party, who read that he is only being hard on the men in order to turn them into soldiers, and he actually thinks that &quot;they are all grand lads, especially little Lofty&quot;.)

There is inconsistency over Williams&#x27;s full name. In the Series 3 episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Take the Micky&quot;, Williams&#x27;s thoughts are broadcast and he uses the name Tudor Bryn Williams to refer to himself, but in the final episode he reads out the name on his newly issued ration book as &quot;B.L. Williams&quot;.

===Concert party===
*Bombardier &quot;Solly&quot; Solomons (George Layton)
&quot;Solly&quot; is a showbiz man who always plays the male leads in the concert party&#x27;s shows and is also the party&#x27;s producer. He is very intelligent, and often has some sort of devious plot to avoid being posted or to get one over on the Sergeant Major. His father was a pawnbroker in Bond Street, and he is Jewish. He leaves at the end of Series 2 when he is demobbed and returns to England.
*Gunner/Bombardier &quot;Gloria&quot; Beaumont (Melvyn Hayes)
&quot;Gloria&quot; Beaumont is a very effeminate person who cannot handle the violence, heat and mosquitoes of army life in India very well. He considers himself an &quot;artiste&quot;, and does not believe he should be in the Army, often trying to emphasise his show business angle and ignore the &quot;soldier&quot; parts of his job. He has a passion for show business and always dresses up as famous film stars during the concert party shows, especially Ginger Rogers. He was later promoted to Bombardier when Bombardier Solomons was demobbed. Despite Beaumont&#x27;s effeminacy, he meets a nurse in the episode &quot;Ticket to Blighty&quot; and they announce they are to be wed. However, no more is heard of this plot line.
*Gunner Nigel &quot;Parky&quot; Parkin (Christopher Mitchell)
&quot;Parky&quot; is the youngest member of the concert party and has tried everything to become part of them, including being a ventriloquist, comedian, and singer, although he is very clumsy and never does anything right. The Sergeant Major falsely believes that Parkin is his son (Williams had a relationship with Parkin&#x27;s mother Edith in Colchester, which is why he treats him much better than he treats the others, and keeps telling him he has &quot;a fine pair of shoulders&quot;). He is not Williams&#x27; son, but when the rest of the concert party discover what the Sgt Major believes, Parkin is welcomed into the party, for the Sgt Major would want to stop it being sent into battle as long as Parkin is a member. In an early episode, the party get hold of Williams&#x27; and Parkin&#x27;s medical records; they discover that Parkin&#x27;s blood group O and Williams&#x27; is AB, so Parkin cannot be his son, but they alter the record of Parkin&#x27;s blood group so that Williams will still believe he is his son. Consequently, Williams becomes very selective about Parkin&#x27;s achievement – praising him when he does something right and ignoring the failure when he makes huge blunders. Lacking any talent as a putative entertainer in the concert party Parkin is appointed as the Battery Clerk, but misunderstands orders. Sergeant-Major Williams instructs him to &quot;remove the mess by the Officers&#x27; lines&quot;, referring to a pile of old beds that were to be discarded. Instead, Parkin proceeds to have the Officer&#x27;s Mess demolished. Later, Colonel Reynolds tells him to order 200 tent pegs, and he instead orders 200 tents. 

Comedy historian Robert Ross describes Parky as being a &quot;beloved staple of the show&quot;, whose naivety, dim-wittedness misunderstandings and letters home to his mother &quot;humanised&quot; the show&#x27;s comedy. Ross wrote that Parky&#x27;s relationship with Sergeant Major Williams gave the series &quot;real heart&quot;.

Parkin references the show&#x27;s title in its first episode, when he signs off a letter to his mother with the words &quot;I&#x27;ve been in India now two days, and it ain&#x27;t half hot, Mum.&quot; He was born on 2 October 1924, and celebrates his 21st birthday at the end of Series 4, in the episode &quot;Twenty-One&quot;.
*&quot;La-De-Dah&quot; Gunner &quot;Paderewski&quot; Jonathan Graham (John Clegg)
Gunner Graham is the concert party&#x27;s pianist. His appearance – bald and bespectacled – marks him out as a stereotypical &quot;boffin&quot;. He has a university degree in English literature (in early episodes, he claims to have attended Oxford, but later this is changed to Cambridge). He is very clever, speaking in an educated manner. This is why the Sergeant Major frequently repeats what he says in an exaggeratedly effete tone, as well as mockingly addressing him as &quot;Mister La-De-Dah Gunner Graham&quot;. Graham often produces difficult and ingenious plans to solve the concert party&#x27;s problems, but these plans never seem to work and often result in him saying &quot;Oh well, bang goes that theory.&quot; The others (even the Sergeant Major and the officers) often rely on his intelligence to get them out of awkward situations.
*Gunner &quot;Atlas&quot; Mackintosh (Stuart McGugan)
&quot;Atlas&quot; Mackintosh (nicknamed after the bodybuilder Charles Atlas) performs the strong man act in the show, which involves tearing telephone directories in half. He is rather short-tempered, especially when Beaumont calls him a &quot;great, big, butch, hairy haggis&quot;. He is very masculine, and is a bit of a contradiction to what Beaumont thinks is right for the concert party. Nevertheless, Mackintosh always tries his best and copes with what is given to him.
*Gunner &quot;Lofty&quot; Harold Horace Herbert Willy Sugden (Don Estelle)
&quot;Lofty&quot; is a soldier whose appearance can be summarised by quoting the Sergeant Major: &quot;Is it a mushroom? No. Is it a soldier? No. It&#x27;s Gunner Sugden.&quot; Lofty is the diminutive, rotund lead singer of the concert party usually seen in an old-fashioned pith helmet. He has an amazing tenor voice, which even the Sergeant Major cannot resist when he sings. Unfortunately, he is always picked out by the Sergeant Major as a &quot;volunteer&quot; when there is a particularly unpleasant or dangerous task to be carried out. He has been married three times; his two previous wives were called Agatha and Betty. Sugden&#x27;s third and present wife is mentioned as sharing a house with Betty.
*Gunner &quot;Nosher&quot; Evans (Mike Kinsey)
&quot;Nosher&quot; Evans does a paper-tearing act. He is always eating something (and once stayed on punishment in the canteen for four hours after he was relieved, as he was enjoying himself); this results in him spraying the contents of his mouth all around him when he speaks.
*Gunner &quot;Nobby&quot; Clark (Kenneth MacDonald)
&quot;Nobby&quot; Clark performs a whistling act in the show, and can do excellent bird impersonations. He is not particularly clever and often makes nonsense comments or observations about situations in which they find themselves.

===Indians===
*Bearer Rangi Ram (Michael Bates)
Rangi Ram is the concert party&#x27;s Indian bearer and very proud to be of service to the army. The Sergeant Major shouts at him more than at anyone else, but Rangi is also the one he confides in when he wants to talk about problems. Rangi often breaks the fourth wall, providing the audience with an &quot;old Hindu proverb&quot; at the end of each episode, such as &quot;There is an old Hindu proverb which say that if you see two eyes looking at you in the dark, it is not always a tiger. It might be two one-eyed tigers!&quot; He is devious, and can often manipulate the situation for his own ends, usually financial. A frequently recurring gag connected with Rangi Ram is his continual references to &quot;we British&quot; and &quot;us British&quot; while at the same time referring to the other Indian characters as &quot;ignorant coolies&quot; or &quot;damned natives&quot;. However, when asked to burn the Indian flag by the Sergeant Major, he refuses. He frequently clears his throat with a hacking sound. Following the death of Michael Bates, Rangi is written out of the series without explanation at the end of Series 5.
*Chai Muhammad (Dino Shafeek)
Muhammed the char walks around the camp all day, selling tea from his urn. He also sings the musical interruptions between the scenes, which are mostly American hit songs, accompanied by a sitar. At the end of the credits, he starts to sing &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; only to be interrupted by the Sergeant Major shouting &quot;SHUT UP!!!&quot;. After Rangi leaves, he takes on the role of Bearer to the concert party, as well as still being the Char Wallah.
*Punkah Wallah Ramzan (Barbar Bhatti)
Ramzan the punkah wallah always sits outside the officers&#x27; quarters, pulling a string that is attached to a large fan indoors. He comments on everything in Urdu, and always adds a few words in English at the end. Rangi often tells him to &quot;sit up straight while you are punkah-ing&quot; (with the word &quot;sit&quot; pronounced with an initial &quot;sh&quot; sound for comedic effect) and not to &quot;be such Clever Dickie&quot;. He is far more intelligent than the others give him credit for, and much of what he observes early on is often borne out in the end, but no one notices. He disappears without explanation at the end of Series 6.

===Others===

====Deolali, India====
*Mrs Daphne Waddilove-Evans (Margaret Courtenay/Frances Bennett)
Mrs Waddilove-Evans is the wife of a local major, who lives in a large house near the camp in Deolali. In the earlier episodes, she is the lover of Colonel Reynolds; the two have a strong relationship, to the point when she accompanies the patrol on a journey to a nearby town. However, the group&#x27;s vehicle breaks down and Rangi recommends that they spend the night in a nearby fort. The Colonel and Mrs Waddilove-Evans agree to meet at midnight and they do so. As Colonel Reynolds is distracted, Mrs Waddilove-Evans is kidnapped by a group of Pathan tribesmen and the concert party, Rangi, Muhammed and Rumzan attempt to save her. They are surprised when they meet her on a horse further on, having gained her freedom. It is implied that she escaped by granting sexual favours to the smugglers.
*Ling Soo (Yasuko Nagazumi)
Ling Soo is a local girl who works as a maid for Major and Mrs Waddilove-Evans. She and Sergeant Major Williams have a continuing relationship. Her father, the owner of the Deolali Chinese restaurant, arranges for Williams and Ling Soo to elope to the mountains and marry secretly. This horrifies Williams, for he would be classed as a deserter, and creates a dilemma for him; should he stay on at the camp, or should he marry Ling Soo? Eventually he reluctantly chooses his profession, and his relationship is not mentioned again.
*Inspector Singh (Nik Zaran)
The Inspector is the head of police in Deolali, who warns Colonel Reynolds and Captain Ashwood on a few occasions when the locals are rioting, demanding that the British go home.

====Tin Min, Burma====
*&quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Me Thant (Burt Kwouk)
Me Thant is a Burmese smuggler, who is bribed by GHQ with twenty pieces of gold a week to keep away from, and avoid assaulting, the local British troops. Later on, he challenges Sergeant Major Williams to a test to see which of the two is more &quot;manly&quot;. Me Thant cheats to make sure he wins the test, but his gang is infiltrated by members of GHQ, resulting in him and his gang being tied against a small plank, &quot;Burmese style&quot;.
*Ah Syn (Andy Ho)
Ah Syn is the cook for the camp later in the series, a man of Chinese ethnicity who served food that Captain Ashwood describes as &quot;furniture stuffing&quot;. Gunner Graham in particular moans that the food is inedible and disgusting. When Captain Ashwood asks if he knows about spotted dick and toad in the hole, he misunderstands entirely and thinks that spotted dick is an illness.

==Episodes==

The series ran for eight series from 1974 to 1981. Each series had between six and eight episodes. In total, there were 56 episodes, and each had a duration of 30 minutes.

===Missing episodes===
Two episodes from the first series, &quot;A Star is Born&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Wise Child&quot;, are currently missing from the BBC Archives, since they were wiped after their repeat broadcasts. In 1988, two off-air VHS recordings of the missing episodes were discovered in Australia by Dave Homewood, the founder of the New Zealand branch of the Dad&#x27;s Army Appreciation Society. They had been recorded from Australian broadcasts on Channel 7; however, they are incomplete, since Channel 7 edited certain scenes from the episodes so that they would fit within the channel&#x27;s timeslot. An estimated four minutes has been edited from these episodes.

==Reception==

===Contemporary reception===
&quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; attracted up to seventeen million viewers during its run.

American actor John Wayne was filming in London in 1974, and caught an episode on television. Unimpressed with what he was seeing, he is reported to have said: &quot;Well, at least the guy playing the sergeant-major has a great voice&quot;.

Spike Milligan is reported to have considered Windsor Davies&#x27; performance the most comedic he had seen.

===Accusations of racism and homophobia===
Unlike other sitcoms written by Perry and Croft, such as &quot;Dad’s Army&quot;, the series does not get repeated by the BBC, as it is regarded as falling short of modern broadcasting standards concerning its content. In 2014, Ed Richards, then chief executive of Ofcom, said 1970s and 1980s sitcoms with racist and offensive content &quot;are unimaginable today&quot;, with all viewers objecting to such broadcasts. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; specified &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; as one of the shows to which he was referring.

Perry told &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Stuart Jeffries in 2003, &quot;It is without doubt the funniest series that David Croft and I wrote. Of course, it is also the show that we&#x27;re not allowed to talk about any more.&quot; Jeffries reported, &quot;It&#x27;s regarded as a racist show, and banished to the televisual margin that is UK Gold&quot;. In the opinion of journalist Neil Clark, for a profile of Perry written for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; a decade later, it &quot;appears to have fallen victim to political correctness&quot;. Clark maintains the show is a classic of the sitcom genre.

The casting of the white actor Michael Bates as the Indian bearer Rangi Ram has been described as an example of blackface. In the 2013 &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; interview, Perry rejected the accusation that Bates &quot;blacked-up&quot;, saying &quot;all he wore was a light tan&quot;. David West Brown wrote, in &quot;English and Empire&quot;, that the case for Bates&#x27; character rests on an assumption that his &quot;dramatic and social functions are not derogatorily comic in the way that depictions of African diaspora identities are&quot; in a series like &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot;. The BBC website article about the series describes Bates as having &quot;blacked up&quot;. The show&#x27;s creators had been aware of the issues around the casting of a white actor wearing darkening makeup to play one of the Indian characters, but went ahead owing to the creators&#x27; belief that there was a lack of suitable Indian actors at the time. In his 2013 &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; interview, Perry defended the casting, commenting that Bates, who was born in India to English parents, &quot;spoke fluent Urdu, and was a captain in the Gurkhas&quot;. Comedian and actor Sanjeev Bhaskar, who is of Indian ethnicity, stated in a 2010 interview: &quot;I&#x27;ve always felt that the criticism of him was too simplistic. Michael Bates was a very funny actor ... and had great comic timing. Rather than race it was really about the class differences between the officer toffs and the sergeant major. [Bates&#x27;s character] Randhi was like Bilko, he had the quick lines and I never felt that he was taking the mickey out of Indians.&quot;

Perry told an interviewer from &quot;Radio Times&quot; in 2014 about this rejection: &quot;You might as well be in Stalin&#x27;s Russia. You don&#x27;t want to upset anyone&quot;. Jeffries asked Perry about the exchanges between the Battery Sergeant Major and the troupe which went &quot;You&#x27;re a load of poofs! What are you?&quot;, followed by the standard response &quot;We&#x27;re a load of poofs!&quot;. Perry commented: &quot;People complain that the language was homophobic, and it was, but it was exactly how people spoke.&quot; He referred to the behaviour of his own Sergeant Major in the concert party in India, who told them: &quot;&#x27;No man who puts on make-up and ponces about on a stage is normal - what are you?&#x27; &#x27;We&#x27;re a bunch of poofs!&#x27; we&#x27;d reply&quot;. Of the depiction of the Melvyn Hayes character &#x27;Gloria&#x27; Beaumont, Croft told interviewer Simon Morgan-Russell that the character &quot;never expressed any interest in other males&quot; and, in fact, &quot;was a transvestite, not a homosexual&quot;.

The series&#x27; overall tone of sympathy towards imperialism is believed to be at least partly responsible for it being no longer repeated on British television in later years, along with, according to Darren Lee writing for the British Film Institute&#x27;s Screenonline website, a belief that it contains &quot;national stereotyping and occasionally patronising humour&quot;, or in the words of Stuart Jeffries in 2015, it contained &quot;obliging underlings sporting cheerful grins that, even when I was a boy, made me cringe.&quot; A. A. Gill wrote in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 2013, &quot;Rather than being satirical, or dramatic, or even a parable, it relied solely on English prejudice and nostalgia&quot;. According to Mark Duguid, again for Screenonline, it suffers &quot;from its narrow stereotypes of its handful of Indian supporting characters as alternately servile, foolish, lazy or devious&quot;. Neil Clark, in a 2005 article for &quot;The Times&quot;, said the series &quot;delightfully lampooned the attitudes of the British in India&quot;. Its perceived flaws have not stopped it appearing in several retrospectives.

Concerning the issues with &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;, Alex Massie wrote in January 2019, shortly after the death of Windsor Davies, that &quot;even when judged by modern standards&quot; the series is a &quot;relatively minor offender when compared with programmes&quot; such as &quot;Mind Your Language&quot;, &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; and &quot;Curry and Chips&quot;.

On 16 June 2023, the series began repeats on That&#x27;s TV. The intention was to screen all episodes of the series (including those retrieved from off-air recordings) in their complete broadcast form, without editing any potentially offensive material.

==Home releases==
All eight series have been released on DVD region codes 2 and 4. A complete collection box set, containing all eight series of the sitcom, was released on 4 October 2010 in Region 2 and re-released in 2018. No complete series boxset has been released in Australia, Region 4.

The missing episodes of the first series (&quot;A Star is Born&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Wise Child&quot;), although not of broadcast quality, are included as special features on both the first series DVD and the complete collection box set.

<text>The Great Depression in the United Kingdom also known as the Great Slump, was a period of national economic downturn in the 1930s, which had its origins in the global Great Depression. It was Britain&#x27;s largest and most profound economic depression of the 20th century. The Great Depression originated in the United States in late 1929 and quickly spread to the world. Britain did not experience the boom that had characterized the U.S., Germany, Canada and Australia in the 1920s, so its effect appeared less severe. Britain&#x27;s world trade fell by half (1929–33), the output of heavy industry fell by a third, employment profits plunged in nearly all sectors. At the depth in summer 1932, registered unemployed numbered 3.5 million, and many more had only part-time employment. However at the same time, from 1929 to 1933 employment dipped only to 94.9% relative to 1929 employment metrics and recovery was seen as early at 1933 (numbers are across the entire country, and unemployment did double over this period relative to 1929 metrics). The positive trend continued across real national income and wages. New houses built increased by 33% from 1929 to 1933, while profits, prices, export volume and value, and imports volume and value dropped. Overall, while all these metrics were concerning to parliament and businessmen along with devastating industrial regions, the common person especially in areas around London did not experience major hardship and even prospered.

Particularly hardest hit by economic problems were the industrial and mining areas in the north of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Unemployment reached 70% in some areas at the start of the 1930s (with more than 3 million out of work nationally) and many families depended entirely on payments from local government known as the dole.

== Background ==
The Great Depression of 1929–32 broke out at a time when the United Kingdom was still far from having recovered from the effects of the First World War. Economist Lee Ohanian showed that economic output fell by 25% between 1918 and 1921 and did not recover until the end of the Great Depression, arguing that the United Kingdom suffered a 20-year great depression beginning in 1918. Relative to the rest of the world, economic output declined mildly in the UK between 1929 and 1934.

Heavy industries which formed the bedrock of Britain&#x27;s export trade (such as coal mining, shipbuilding and steel) were heavily concentrated in certain areas of Britain, such as northern England, South Wales, Northern Ireland and central Scotland, while the newer industries were heavily concentrated in southern and central England. British industrial output during the 1920s ran at about 80–100%, and exports at about 80% of their pre-war levels.

==Gold standard==
From 1921 Britain began a slow economic recovery from the world war one and the subsequent slump. But in April 1925, the Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill, on advice from the Bank of England, restored the Pound Sterling to the gold standard at its prewar exchange rate of $4.86 US dollars to one pound. This made the pound convertible to its value in gold, but at a level that made British exports more expensive on world markets. The price of gold was over-estimated by 10–14% leading to coal and steel as an export becoming less competitive. The economic recovery immediately slowed. To offset the effects of the high exchange rate, the export industries tried to cut costs by lowering workers&#x27; wages.

The industrial areas were in recession during the rest of the 1920s. These industries received little investment or modernization. Throughout the 1920s, unemployment stayed at a steady one million.

==Economic crisis and the Labour minority government==
In May 1929, a minority Labour government headed by Ramsay MacDonald came to office with Liberal support. This was only the second time a Labour government had been in office (they had briefly been in office in 1924). Few of the government&#x27;s members had any deep knowledge of economics or experience of running the economy. MacDonald&#x27;s Labour Party was not radical in economic thinking, and was wedded to the orthodoxy of classical economics with its emphasis on maintaining a balanced budget at any cost.

In October 1929, the Stock Market Crash in New York heralded the worldwide Great Depression. John Maynard Keynes, who had not predicted the slump, said, &quot;There will be no serious direct consequences in London. We find the look ahead decidedly encouraging.&quot;

Doomsayers on the left such as Sidney and Beatrice Webb, J. A. Hobson, and G. D. H. Cole repeated the dire warnings they had been making for years about the imminent death of capitalism, only now far more people paid attention. Starting in 1935 the Left Book Club provided a new warning every month, and built up the credibility of Soviet-style socialism as an alternative.

The ensuing American economic collapse shook the world: World trade contracted, prices fell and governments faced financial crisis as the supply of American credit dried up. Many countries adopted an emergency response to the crisis by erecting trade barriers and tariffs, which worsened the crisis by further hindering global trade. The British Empire tried to hang together by lower tariffs among the members, known as Imperial Preference, while raising them against the U.S. and others.

The effects on the industrial areas of Britain were immediate and devastating, as demand for British products collapsed. By the end of 1930, unemployment had more than doubled from 1 million to 2.5 million (from 12% to 20% of the insured workforce), and exports had fallen in value by 50%. During this time there were little to no unemployment benefits, so this mass unemployment led to many of Britain&#x27;s population becoming impoverished. Government revenues contracted as national income fell, while the cost of assisting the jobless rose. The industrial areas were hardest hit, along with the coal mining districts. London and the south-east of England were hurt less. In 1933, 30% of Glaswegians were unemployed due to the severe decline in heavy industry.

Under pressure from its Liberal allies as well as the Conservative opposition, the Labour government appointed a committee to review the state of public finances. The May Report of July 1931 urged public sector wage cuts and large cuts in public spending (notably in benefit payments (&quot;dole&quot;) to the unemployed) to avoid incurring a budget deficit. The sense was that the deficit was dangerous and had to be reduced; the proposal was to meet £24 million by increased taxes on the rich, and £96 million by economies, of which £64 million would come from unemployment relief. This proposal proved deeply unpopular within the Labour Party and among its main supporters, the trade unions, which along with several government ministers refused to support any such measures. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, insisted that the Report&#x27;s recommendations be adopted to avoid incurring a budget deficit.

In a memorandum in January 1930, one junior government minister, Oswald Mosley, proposed that the government take control of banking and exports, as well as increase pensions to boost purchasing power. When his ideas were turned down, he left Labour to form the New Party, and later the British Union of Fascists.

==National Government==

The dispute over spending and wage cuts split the Labour government: as it turned out, beyond recovery. The political deadlock that resulted caused investors to take fright, and a flight of capital and gold further de-stabilised the economy. In response, MacDonald, on the urging of King George V, decided to form a &quot;National Government&quot; with the Conservatives and the Liberals.

On 24 August, MacDonald submitted the resignation of his ministers and led his senior colleagues in forming the new National Government. MacDonald and his supporters were expelled from the Labour Party and adopted the label &quot;National Labour&quot;. The Labour Party and some Liberals, led by David Lloyd George, went into opposition. The Labour Party denounced MacDonald as a &quot;traitor&quot; and a &quot;rat&quot; for what they saw as his betrayal.

Soon after this, a general election was called. The 1931 general election resulted in a Conservative landslide victory, with the now leaderless Labour Party winning only 46 seats in Parliament. After the 1931 election the national government was Conservative-dominated, although MacDonald continued as prime minister until 1935.

===Emergency measures===
In an effort to balance the budget and restore confidence in the pound, on 10 September 1931 with Philip Snowden still as Chancellor, the new national government issued an emergency budget, which immediately instituted a round of cuts in public spending and wages. Public sector wages and unemployment pay were cut by 10%, and income tax was raised from 4&quot;s&quot; 6&quot;d&quot; up to 5&quot;s&quot; on the pound (from 22.5% to 25%). The pay cuts did not go down well, however, and resulted in a non-violent &quot;mutiny&quot; in the Royal Navy protesting the pay cut.

These measures were deflationary and merely reduced purchasing power in the economy, worsening the situation, and by the end of 1931 unemployment had reached nearly 3 million. The measures were also unsuccessful at defending the gold standard, which the National Government had ostensibly been created to defend.

The flight of gold continued, however, and the Treasury finally was forced to abandon the gold standard in September 1931. Until now the government had religiously followed orthodox policies which demanded balanced budgets and the gold standard. Instead of the predicted disaster, cutting loose from gold proved a major advantage. Immediately the exchange rate of the pound fell by 25%, from $4.86 for one pound to $3.40. British exports were now much more competitive, which laid the ground for a gradual economic recovery. The worst was over.

Also, in 1932 following the Ottawa Agreement, Neville Chamberlain, who had become Chancellor after the 1931 election, introduced tariffs on industrial and agricultural imports at a rate of 10% on all imports except those from the countries of the British Empire. The introduction of tariffs caused a split in the Liberal Party, some of whom, along with Phillip Snowden, withdrew support for the National Government.

==During the recession==
Although the overall picture for the British economy in the 1930s was bleak, the effects of the depression were uneven. Some parts of the country, and some industries, fared better than others. Some parts of the country such as the South Wales Valleys experienced mass unemployment and poverty, while some areas in the Home Counties did not.

The brightest spot was in home building. From 1926 through 1939 over 200,000 new houses were built every year, with the peak reaching 365,000 in 1936. Many suburban districts in London and other cities were built at this time, and Brighton shows many signs of more &quot;high deco&quot; home architecture.

===The South and the Midlands===
In London and the south east of England unemployment was initially as high as 13.5%, the later 1930s were a prosperous time in these areas, as a suburban house-building boom was fuelled by the low interest rates which followed the abolition of the gold standard, and as London&#x27;s growing population buoyed the economy of the Home Counties.

The south was also the home of new developing industries such as the electrical industry, which prospered from the large-scale electrification of housing and industry. Mass production methods brought new products such as electrical cookers and radios into the reach of the middle classes, and the industries which produced these prospered. Nearly half of all new factories that opened in Britain between 1932 and 1937 were in the Greater London area.

Another industry that prospered during the 1930s was the British motor industry. For cities that had a developed motor industry such as Birmingham, Coventry and Oxford, the 1930s were also a boom time. Manufacturers such as Austin, Morris and Ford dominated the motor industry during the 1930s, and the number of cars on British roads doubled within the decade. British agriculture also flourished in the 1930s.

===In the North and industrial heartlands===
Northern England, however, was a quite different matter. The north was the home to most of Britain&#x27;s traditional heavy industries, such as coal mining in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, shipbuilding on Tyneside and Wearside, steel in Sheffield and textiles in Lancashire which were heavily export-orientated. The north bore the brunt of the depression, and the 1930s were the most difficult time in living memory for people in these areas. The north was hit so hard in the Great Depression because of the structural decline in British industry. Staple industries such as coal, steel and shipbuilding were smaller, less modern and efficient and over-staffed compared to continental rivals.

In the north east (including Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Newcastle-upon-Tyne) this was especially so. The north east was a major centre of the shipbuilding industry. The Depression caused a collapse in demand for ships. Between 1929-32 ship production declined by 90%, and this in turn affected all the supply industries such as steel and coal. In some towns and cities in the north east, unemployment reached as high as 70%. Among the worst affected towns was Jarrow, where unemployment led to the famous Jarrow March, in which unemployed workers marched to London to protest against unemployment.

The north west, a centre of the textile industries, was also hard hit, with places such as Manchester and Lancashire suffering a slump. The South Wales Valleys, a centre of the coal mining and steel industries, was also devastated by the depression where towns such as Merthyr Tydfil and Swansea had unemployment rates reaching above 25% at certain times. The industrial belt of central Scotland, also a major shipbuilding centre in Glasgow, was also hard hit by the slump.

In these areas, millions of unemployed and their families were left destitute, and queueing at soup kitchens became a way of life. A government report in the mid-1930s estimated that around 25% of the UK&#x27;s population existed on a subsistence diet, often with signs of child malnutrition such as scurvy, rickets and tuberculosis. In his book &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;, George Orwell described life for the unemployed in northern England during the depression: &quot;Several hundred men risk their lives and several hundred women scrabble in the mud for hours... searching eagerly for tiny chips of coal in slagheaps so they could heat their own homes. For them, this arduously-gained &#x27;free&#x27; coal was more important almost than food.&quot;

==Welfare state during the 1930s==
In the 1920s and 1930s, Britain had a relatively advanced welfare system compared to many of the industrialised countries. In 1911 a compulsory national unemployment and health insurance scheme had been put in place by the Liberal government of H. H. Asquith (see Liberal reforms). This scheme had been funded through contributions from the government, the employers and the workers. At first the scheme only applied to certain trades but, in 1920, it was expanded to include most manual workers.

However, the scheme only paid out according to the level of contributions made rather than according to need, and was only payable for 15 weeks. Anyone unemployed for longer than that had to rely on poor law relief paid by their local authority. In effect, millions of workers who had been too poorly paid to make contributions, or who had been unemployed long term, were left destitute by the scheme. With the mass unemployment of the 1930s, contributions to the insurance scheme dried up, resulting in a funding crisis.

In August 1931, the 1911 scheme was replaced by a fully government-funded unemployment benefit system. This system, for the first time, paid out according to need rather than the level of contributions. This unemployment benefit was subject to a strict means test, and anyone applying for unemployment pay had to have an inspection by a government official to make sure that they had no hidden earnings or savings, undisclosed source(s) of income or other means of support. For many poor people, this was a humiliating experience and was much resented.

==Slow recovery==
Following Britain&#x27;s withdrawal from the gold standard and the devaluation of the pound, interest rates were reduced from 6% to 2%. As a result, British exports became more competitive on world markets than those of countries that remained on the gold standard. This led to a modest economic recovery, and a fall in unemployment from 1933 onwards. Although exports were still a fraction of their pre-depression levels, they recovered slightly.

Unemployment began a modest fall in 1934 and fell further in 1935 and 1936, but the rise in employment levels occurred mostly in the south, where lower interest rates had spurred the house building boom, which in turn spurred a recovery in domestic industry. The North and Wales remained severely depressed for most of the decade. In severely depressed parts of the country, the government enacted a number of policies to stimulate growth and reduce unemployment, including road building, loans to shipyards, and tariffs on steel imports. These policies helped but were not, however, on a sufficiently large scale to make a huge impact on the unemployment levels.

==Rearmament and recovery==
Since Britain&#x27;s debt was 180% of the national GDP economic recovery was difficult. The United Kingdom was able to recover more quickly than other countries that were equally as developed, because their economic growth had been stagnant for some time. This meant that they did not have exponential growth, as the United States did, leaving them with less room to fall. Due to the abandonment of the gold standard in 1931 Britain was able to cut interest rates which led to a drop in real interest rates. This drop in interests rates subsequently led to a boom in construction in the south of Britain; stimulating some renewed economic growth. Also, the government began spending money on goods and services within Britain which aided in the foundation of financial recovery.
From 1936 onwards, the National Government followed a policy of mass rearmament in the face of the rise of Nazi Germany. By 1937 unemployment had fallen to 1.5 million, but rose again to 1,810,000 by January 1938 suggesting that the recovery was to be short lived.

==Consequences of the Great Depression==
By the end of the Second World War in 1945, the majority of the British people, and particularly the working class and returning servicemen and women, were keenly dissatisfied. They rejected a return to pre-war Conservative economic policies, which they blamed for the hardship of the 1930s. They demanded widespread social change. At the 1945 general election, to the surprise of most observers, Conservatives led by Winston Churchill were defeated by the Labour Party headed by Clement Attlee.

The Labour government built up from pre-war foundations what was to become a comprehensive &#x27;cradle-to-grave&#x27; welfare state, and established a tax funded National Health Service, which gave treatment according to need rather than ability to pay as the previous tax funded system had been. The Labour government also enacted Keynesian economic policies, to create artificial economic demand leading to full employment. These policies became known as the &quot;post-war consensus&quot;, and were accepted by all major political parties at different times.

There were noted disagreements about the involvement of the state with the steel industry. With one government, it was state-owned, to then be sold off with the following Conservative ministry only to be then re-nationalised by the following Labour government. For the most part, the post-war consensus lasted until the late-1970s. Throughout the 1970s, it was becoming clear from all sides that radical change was needed as a result of such economic crises as the 1973 oil shock, high inflation, industrial unrest and sterling devaluation.

==Historic evaluation==
The events of the 1930s, and the response of the Labour and National governments to the depression, have generated much historical controversy.

In the decades immediately following the Second World War, most historical opinion was critical of the governments of the period. Certain historians, such as Robert Skidelsky in his &quot;Politicians and the Slump&quot;, compared the orthodox policies of the Labour and National governments unfavourably with the more radical proto-Keynesian measures advocated by David Lloyd George and Oswald Mosley, and the more interventionist and Keynesian responses in other economies: Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal in the United States, the Labour government in New Zealand, and the Social Democratic government in Sweden. Since the 1970s opinion has become less uniformly hostile. In the preface to the 1994 edition, Skidelsky argues that recent experience of currency crises and capital flight make it hard to be so critical of the politicians who wanted to achieve stability by cutting labour costs and defending the value of the currency.

<text>Robert Hyde Greg (24 September 1795 – 21 February 1875), was an English industrialist, economist, antiquary, and - briefly - a Member of Parliament.

Born in Manchester, he was the son of Samuel Greg and Hannah Lightbody, the creators of Quarry Bank Mill, a pioneering factory of the early Industrial Revolution. His family were Unitarians, part of the prosperous dissenting community that characterised the entrepreneurial class of factory owners. He was brother to William Rathbone Greg and the junior Samuel Greg. He attended the University of Edinburgh and, after the obligatory Grand Tour of the antiquities of Continental Europe, joined his father&#x27;s textile manufacturing enterprise.

He was active in the city&#x27;s intellectual life as a member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society and was a founder of 
its Mechanics&#x27; Institute. He was an active member of the Liberal Party and the Anti-Corn Law League. Though he was elected to Parliament for Manchester in 1839, it was without his consent and he resigned in the following year. He was an opponent of factory reform, trades unions and worker health and safety legislation.

He died at Norcliffe Hall, Styal, Cheshire and is buried at the Dean Row Unitarian Chapel, Wilmslow.

Greg was also a slaveholder; tenant-in-common of Cane Garden, St Vincent Island, with 82 enslaved people.

<text>Percy Greg (7 January 1836 Bury – 24 December 1889, Chelsea), son of William Rathbone Greg, was an English writer.

Percy Greg, like his father, wrote about politics, but his views were violently reactionary: his &quot;History of the United States to the Reconstruction of the Union&quot; (1887) can be said to be more of a polemic, rather than a history.

His &quot;Across the Zodiac&quot; (1880) is an early science fiction novel, said to be the progenitor of the sword-and-planet genre. For that novel, Greg created what may have been the first artistic language that was described with linguistic and grammatical terminology. It also contained what is possibly the first instance in the English language of the word &quot;astronaut&quot;.

In 2010,a crater on Mars was named Greg in recognition of his contribution to the lore of Mars.

Percy Greg used the pseudonym &#x27;Lionel H. Holdreth&#x27; when writing for George Jacob Holyoake&#x27;s freethinking periodical, &quot;The Reasoner&quot;, in the 1850s, and he edited the paper for a while in 1859 when Holyoake was ill.

<doc id="287299" wikidata="Q193894" url="?curid=287299" title="Sarcoidosis">
<text>Sarcoidosis (; also known as Besnier–Boeck–Schaumann disease) is a disease involving abnormal collections of inflammatory cells that form lumps known as granulomata. The disease usually begins in the lungs, skin, or lymph nodes. Less commonly affected are the eyes, liver, heart, and brain, though any organ can be affected. The signs and symptoms depend on the organ involved. Often, no symptoms or only mild symptoms are seen. When it affects the lungs, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain may occur. Some may have Löfgren syndrome with fever, enlarged hilar lymph nodes, arthritis, and a rash known as erythema nodosum.
The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. Some believe it may be due to an immune reaction to a trigger such as an infection or chemicals in those who are genetically predisposed. Those with affected family members are at greater risk. Diagnosis is partly based on signs and symptoms, which may be supported by biopsy. Findings that make it likely include large lymph nodes at the root of the lung on both sides, high blood calcium with a normal parathyroid hormone level, or elevated levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme in the blood. The diagnosis should be made only after excluding other possible causes of similar symptoms such as tuberculosis.
Sarcoidosis may resolve without any treatment within a few years. However, some people may have long-term or severe disease. Some symptoms may be improved with the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen. In cases where the condition causes significant health problems, steroids such as prednisone are indicated. Medications such as methotrexate, chloroquine, or azathioprine may occasionally be used in an effort to decrease the side effects of steroids. The risk of death is 1–7%. The chance of the disease returning in someone who has had it previously is less than 5%.
In 2015, pulmonary sarcoidosis and interstitial lung disease affected 1.9 million people globally and they resulted in 122,000 deaths. It is most common in Scandinavians, but occurs in all parts of the world. In the United States, risk is greater among black people as opposed to white people. It usually begins between the ages of 20 and 50. It occurs more often in women than men. Sarcoidosis was first described in 1877 by the English doctor Jonathan Hutchinson as a non-painful skin disease.

==Signs and symptoms==
Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ, although it can be asymptomatic and is discovered by accident in about 5% of cases. Common symptoms, which tend to be vague, include fatigue (unrelieved by sleep; occurs in up to 85% of cases), lack of energy, weight loss, joint aches and pains (which occur in about 70% of cases), arthritis (14–38% of cases), dry eyes, swelling of the knees, blurry vision, shortness of breath, a dry, hacking cough, or skin lesions. Less commonly, people may cough up blood. Sarcoidosis is also accompanied by psychological distress and symptoms of anxiety and depression, which are also associated with fatigue. The cutaneous symptoms vary, and range from rashes and noduli (small bumps) to erythema nodosum, granuloma annulare, or lupus pernio. Sarcoidosis and cancer may mimic one another, making the distinction difficult.

The combination of erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and joint pain is called Löfgren syndrome, which has a relatively good prognosis. This form of the disease occurs significantly more often in Scandinavian patients than in those of non-Scandinavian origin.

===Respiratory tract===
Localization to the lungs is by far the most common manifestation of sarcoidosis. At least 90% of those affected experience lung involvement. Overall, about 50% develop permanent pulmonary abnormalities, and 5 to 15% have progressive fibrosis of the lung parenchyma. Sarcoidosis of the lung is primarily an interstitial lung disease in which the inflammatory process involves the alveoli, small bronchi, and small blood vessels. In acute and subacute cases, physical examination usually reveals dry crackles. At least 5% of cases include pulmonary arterial hypertension. The upper respiratory tract (including the larynx, pharynx, and sinuses) may be affected, which occurs in between 5 and 10% of cases.

The four stages of pulmonary involvement are based on radiological stage of the disease, which is helpful in prognosis:
* Stage I: bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL) alone
* Stage II: BHL with pulmonary infiltrates
* Stage III: pulmonary infiltrates without BHL
* Stage IV: fibrosis

Use of the Scadding scale only provides general information regarding the prognosis of the pulmonary disease over time. Caution is recommended, as it only shows a general relation with physiological markers of the disease and the variation is such that it has limited applicability in individual assessments, including treatment decisions.

===Skin===

Sarcoidosis involves the skin in between 9 and 37% of cases and is more common in African Americans than in European Americans. The skin is the second-most commonly affected organ after the lungs. The most common lesions are erythema nodosum, plaques, maculopapular eruptions, subcutaneous nodules, and lupus pernio. Treatment is not required, since the lesions usually resolve spontaneously in 2–4 weeks. Although it may be disfiguring, cutaneous sarcoidosis rarely causes major problems. Sarcoidosis of the scalp presents with diffuse or patchy hair loss.

===Heart===
Histologically, sarcoidosis of the heart is an active granulomatous inflammation surrounded by reactive oedema. The distribution of affected areas is patchy with localised enlargement of heart muscles. This causes scarring and remodelling of the heart, which leads to dilatation of heart cavities and thinning of heart muscles. As the situation progresses, it leads to aneurysm of heart chambers. When the distribution is diffuse, there would be dilatation of both ventricles of the heart, causing heart failure and arrhythmia. When the conduction system in the intraventricular septum is affected, it would lead to heart block, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular arrhythmia, causing sudden death. Nevertheless, the involvement of pericardium and heart valves are uncommon.

The frequency of cardiac involvement varies and is significantly influenced by race; in Japan, more than 25% of those with sarcoidosis have symptomatic cardiac involvement, whereas in the US and Europe, only about 5% of cases present with cardiac involvement. Autopsy studies in the US have revealed a frequency of cardiac involvement of about 20–30%, whereas autopsy studies in Japan have shown a frequency of 60%. The presentation of cardiac sarcoidosis can range from asymptomatic conduction abnormalities to fatal ventricular arrhythmia.

Conduction abnormalities are the most common cardiac manifestations of sarcoidosis in humans and can include complete heart block. Second to conduction abnormalities, in frequency, are ventricular arrhythmias, which occurs in about 23% of cases with cardiac involvement. Sudden cardiac death, either due to ventricular arrhythmias or complete heart block is a rare complication of cardiac sarcoidosis. Cardiac sarcoidosis can cause fibrosis, granuloma formation, or the accumulation of fluid in the interstitium of the heart, or a combination of the former two. Cardiac sarcoidosis may also cause congestive heart failure when granulomas cause myocardial fibrosis and scarring. Congestive heart failure affects 25-75% of those with cardiac sarcoidosis. Diabetes mellitus and sarcoidosis-related arrhythmias are believed to be strong risk factors of heart failure in sarcoidosis. A small (20-40%) increased risk of acute myocardial infarction has also been described. Pulmonary arterial hypertension occurs by two mechanisms in cardiac sarcoidosis: reduced left heart function due to granulomas weakening the heart muscle or from impaired blood flow.

===Eye===
Eye involvement occurs in about 10–90% of cases. Manifestations in the eye include uveitis, uveoparotitis, and retinal inflammation, which may result in loss of visual acuity or blindness. The most common ophthalmologic manifestation of sarcoidosis is uveitis. The combination of anterior uveitis, parotitis, VII cranial nerve paralysis and fever is called uveoparotid fever or Heerfordt syndrome (). Development of scleral nodule associated with sarcoidosis has been observed.

===Nervous system===

Any of the components of the nervous system can be involved. Sarcoidosis affecting the nervous system is known as neurosarcoidosis. Cranial nerves are most commonly affected, accounting for about 5–30% of neurosarcoidosis cases, and peripheral facial nerve palsy, often bilateral, is the most common neurological manifestation of sarcoidosis. It occurs suddenly and is usually transient. The central nervous system involvement is present in 10–25% of sarcoidosis cases. Other common manifestations of neurosarcoidosis include optic nerve dysfunction, papilledema, palate dysfunction, neuroendocrine changes, hearing abnormalities, hypothalamic and pituitary abnormalities, chronic meningitis, and peripheral neuropathy. Myelopathy, that is spinal cord involvement, occurs in about 16–43% of neurosarcoidosis cases and is often associated with the poorest prognosis of the neurosarcoidosis subtypes. Whereas facial nerve palsies and acute meningitis due to sarcoidosis tend to have the most favourable prognosis, another common finding in sarcoidosis with neurological involvement is autonomic or sensory small-fiber neuropathy. Neuroendocrine sarcoidosis accounts for about 5–10% of neurosarcoidosis cases and can lead to diabetes insipidus, changes in menstrual cycle and hypothalamic dysfunction. The latter can lead to changes in body temperature, mood, and prolactin (see the endocrine and exocrine section for details).

===Endocrine and exocrine===
Prolactin is frequently increased in sarcoidosis, between 3 and 32% of cases have hyperprolactinemia this frequently leads to amenorrhea, galactorrhea, or nonpuerperal mastitis in women. It also frequently causes an increase in 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, the active metabolite of vitamin D, which is usually hydroxylated within the kidney, but in sarcoidosis patients, hydroxylation of vitamin D can occur outside the kidneys, namely inside the immune cells found in the granulomas the condition produces. 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D is the main cause for hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis and is overproduced by sarcoid granulomata. Gamma-interferon produced by activated lymphocytes and macrophages plays a major role in the synthesis of 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3. Hypercalciuria (excessive secretion of calcium in one&#x27;s urine) and hypercalcemia (an excessively high amount of calcium in the blood) are seen in &lt;10% of individuals and likely results from the increased 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D production.

Thyroid dysfunction is seen in 4.2–4.6% of cases.

Parotid enlargement occurs in about 5–10% of cases. Bilateral involvement is the rule. The gland is usually not tender, but firm and smooth. Dry mouth can occur; other exocrine glands are affected only rarely. The eyes, their glands, or the parotid glands are affected in 20–50% of cases.

===Gastrointestinal and genitourinary===
Symptomatic gastrointestinal (GI) involvement occurs in less than 1% of cases (if one excludes the liver), and most commonly the stomach is affected, although the small or large intestine may also be affected in a small portion of cases. Studies at autopsy have revealed GI involvement in less than 10% of people. These cases would likely mimic Crohn&#x27;s disease, which is a more commonly intestine-affecting granulomatous disease. About 1–3% of people have evidence of pancreatic involvement at autopsy. Symptomatic kidney involvement occurs in just 0.7% of cases, although evidence of kidney involvement at autopsy has been reported in up to 22% of people and occurs exclusively in cases of chronic disease. Symptomatic kidney involvement is usually nephrocalcinosis, although granulomatous interstitial nephritis that presents with reduced creatinine clearance and little proteinuria is a close second. Less commonly, the epididymis, testicles, prostate, ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, or the vulva may be affected, the latter may cause vulva itchiness. Testicular involvement has been reported in about 5% of people at autopsy. In males, sarcoidosis may lead to infertility.

Around 70% of people have granulomas in their livers, although only in about 20–30% of cases, liver function test anomalies reflecting this fact are seen. About 5–15% of patients exhibit hepatomegaly. Only 5–30% of cases of liver involvement are symptomatic. Usually, these changes reflect a cholestatic pattern and include raised levels of alkaline phosphatase (which is the most common liver function test anomaly seen in those with sarcoidosis), while bilirubin and aminotransferases are only mildly elevated. Jaundice is rare.

===Blood===
Abnormal blood tests are frequent, accounting for over 50% of cases, but are not diagnostic. Lymphopenia is the most common blood anomaly in sarcoidosis. Anemia occurs in about 20% of people with sarcoidosis. Leukopenia is less common and occurs in even fewer cases but is rarely severe. Thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia are fairly rare. In the absence of splenomegaly, leukopenia may reflect bone marrow involvement, but the most common mechanism is a redistribution of blood T cells to sites of disease. Other nonspecific findings include monocytosis, occurring in the majority of sarcoidosis cases, increased hepatic enzymes or alkaline phosphatase. People with sarcoidosis often have immunologic anomalies like allergies to test antigens such as &quot;Candida&quot; or purified protein derivative. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia is also a fairly common immunologic anomaly seen in sarcoidosis.

Lymphadenopathy (swollen glands) is common in sarcoidosis and occurs in 15% of cases. Intrathoracic nodes are enlarged in 75 to 90% of all people; usually this involves the hilar nodes, but the paratracheal nodes are commonly involved. Peripheral lymphadenopathy is very common, particularly involving the cervical (the most common head and neck manifestation of the disease), axillary, epitrochlear, and inguinal nodes. Approximately 75% of cases show microscopic involvement of the spleen, although only in about 5–10% of cases does splenomegaly appear.

===Bone, joints, and muscles===
Sarcoidosis can be involved with the joints, bones, and muscles. This causes a wide variety of musculoskeletal complaints that act through different mechanisms.
About 5–15% of cases affect the bones, joints, or muscles.

Arthritic syndromes can be categorized as acute or chronic.
Sarcoidosis patients with acute arthritis often also have bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and erythema nodosum. These three associated syndromes often occur together in Löfgren syndrome. The arthritis symptoms of Löfgren syndrome occur most frequently in the ankles, followed by the knees, wrists, elbows, and metacarpophalangeal joints. Usually, true arthritis is not present, but instead, periarthritis appears as a swelling in the soft tissue around the joints that can be seen by ultrasonographic methods.
These joint symptoms tend to precede or occur at the same time as erythema nodosum develops. Even when erythema nodosum is absent, it is believed that the combination of hilar lymphadenopathy and ankle periarthritis can be considered as a variant of Löfgren syndrome.
Enthesitis also occurs in about one-third of patients with acute sarcoid arthritis, mainly affecting the Achilles tendon and heels. Soft-tissue swelling of the ankles can be prominent, and biopsy of this soft tissue reveals no granulomas, but does show panniculitis similar to erythema nodosum.

Chronic sarcoid arthritis usually occurs in the setting of more diffuse organ involvement. The ankles, knees, wrists, elbows, and hands may all be affected in the chronic form and often this presents itself in a polyarticular pattern. Dactylitis similar to that seen in psoriatic arthritis, that is associated with pain, swelling, overlying skin erythema, and underlying bony changes may also occur. Development of Jaccoud arthropathy (a nonerosive deformity) is very rarely seen.

Bone involvement in sarcoidosis has been reported in 1–13% of cases. The most frequent sites of involvement are the hands and feet, whereas the spine is less commonly affected. Half of the patients with bony lesions experience pain and stiffness, whereas the other half remain asymptomatic.
Periostitis is rarely seen in sarcoidosis and has been found to present itself at the femoral bone.

==Cause==
The exact cause of sarcoidosis is not known. The current working hypothesis is, in genetically susceptible individuals, sarcoidosis is caused through alteration to the immune response after exposure to an environmental, occupational, or infectious agent. Some cases may be caused by treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors like etanercept.

===Genetics===
The heritability of sarcoidosis varies according to ethnicity. About 20% of African Americans with sarcoidosis have a family member with the condition, whereas the same figure for European Americans is about 5%. Additionally, in African Americans, who seem to experience more severe and chronic disease, siblings and parents of sarcoidosis cases have about a 2.5-fold increased risk for developing the disease. In Swedish individuals heritability was found to be 39%. In this group, if a first-degree family member was affected, a person has a four-fold greater risk of being affected.

Investigations of genetic susceptibility yielded many candidate genes, but only few were confirmed by further investigations and no reliable genetic markers are known. Currently, the most interesting candidate gene is &quot;BTNL2&quot;; several &quot;HLA-DR&quot; risk alleles are also being investigated. In persistent sarcoidosis, the HLA haplotype &quot;HLA-B7-DR15&quot; is either cooperating in disease or another gene between these two loci is associated. In nonpersistent disease, a strong genetic association exists with &quot;HLA DR3-DQ2&quot;. Cardiac sarcoid has been connected to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA) variants.

===Infectious agents===
Several infectious agents appear to be significantly associated with sarcoidosis, but none of the known associations is specific enough to suggest a direct causative role. The major implicated infectious agents include: mycobacteria, fungi, borrelia, and rickettsia. A meta-analysis investigating the role of mycobacteria in sarcoidosis found it was present in 26.4% of cases, but they also detected a possible publication bias, so the results need further confirmation. &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; catalase-peroxidase has been identified as a possible antigen catalyst of sarcoidosis. The disease has also been reported by transmission via organ transplants. A large epidemiological study found little evidence that infectious diseases spanning years before sarcoidosis diagnosis could confer measurable risks for sarcoidosis diagnosis in the future.

===Autoimmune===
Association of autoimmune disorders has been frequently observed. The exact mechanism of this relation is not known, but some evidence supports the hypothesis that this is a consequence of Th1 lymphokine prevalence. Tests of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity have been used to measure progression.

==Pathophysiology==
Granulomatous inflammation is characterized primarily by the accumulation of macrophages and activated T-lymphocytes, with increased production of key inflammatory mediators, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), interferon gamma, interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, IL-23 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), indicative of a T helper cell-mediated immune response.
Sarcoidosis has paradoxical effects on inflammatory processes; it is characterized by increased macrophage and CD4 helper T-cell activation, resulting in accelerated inflammation, but immune response to antigen challenges such as tuberculin is suppressed. This paradoxic state of simultaneous hyper- and hypoactivity is suggestive of a state of anergy. The anergy may also be responsible for the increased risk of infections and cancer. The regulatory T-lymphocytes in the periphery of sarcoid granulomas appear to suppress IL-2 secretion, which is hypothesized to cause the state of anergy by preventing antigen-specific memory responses.

While TNF is widely believed to play an important role in the formation of granulomas (this is further supported by the finding that in animal models of mycobacterial granuloma formation inhibition of either TNF or IFN-γ production inhibits granuloma formation), sarcoidosis can and does still develop in those being treated with TNF antagonists like etanercept.
B cells also likely play a role in the pathophysiology of sarcoidosis. Serum levels of soluble human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I antigens and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) are higher in people with sarcoidosis. Likewise the ratio of CD4/CD8 T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage is usually higher in people with pulmonary sarcoidosis (usually &gt;3.5), although it can be normal or even abnormally low in some cases. Serum ACE levels have been found to usually correlate with total granuloma load.

Cases of sarcoidosis have also been reported as part of the immune reconstitution syndrome of HIV, that is, when people receive treatment for HIV, their immune system rebounds and the result is that it starts to attack the antigens of opportunistic infections caught prior to said rebound and the resulting immune response starts to damage healthy tissue.

===Histopathology===
Sarcoidosis is characterized by the formation of non-necrotizing (&quot;non-caseating&quot;) granulomas in various organs and tissues. Giant cells, specifically Langhans giant cells, are often seen in sarcoidosis. Schaumann bodies seen in sarcoidosis are calcium and protein inclusions inside of giant cells as part of a granuloma. Asteroid bodies can be seen in sarcoidosis. Hamazaki–Wesenberg bodies can be seen in lymph nodes and more rarely in lung biopsies with sarcoidosis and are inclusion bodies of lysosomes with protein, glycoprotein and iron.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis of sarcoidosis is a matter of exclusion, as there is no specific test for the condition other than the Kveim-Siltzbach test. To exclude sarcoidosis in a case presenting with pulmonary symptoms might involve a chest radiograph, CT scan of chest, PET scan, CT-guided biopsy, mediastinoscopy, open lung biopsy, bronchoscopy with biopsy, endobronchial ultrasound, and endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration of mediastinal lymph nodes (EBUS FNA). Tissue from biopsy of lymph nodes is subjected to both flow cytometry to rule out cancer and special stains (acid fast bacilli stain and Gömöri methenamine silver stain) to rule out microorganisms and fungi.

Serum markers of sarcoidosis, include: serum amyloid A, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, lysozyme, angiotensin converting enzyme, and the glycoprotein KL-6. Angiotensin-converting enzyme blood levels are used in the monitoring of sarcoidosis. A bronchoalveolar lavage can show an elevated (of at least 3.5) CD4/CD8 T cell ratio, which is indicative (but not proof) of pulmonary sarcoidosis. In at least one study the induced sputum ratio of CD4/CD8 and level of TNF was correlated to those in the lavage fluid. A sarcoidosis-like lung disease called granulomatous–lymphocytic interstitial lung disease can be seen in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and therefore serum antibody levels should be measured to exclude CVID.

Differential diagnosis includes metastatic disease, lymphoma, septic emboli, rheumatoid nodules, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, varicella infection, tuberculosis, and atypical infections, such as &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot; complex, cytomegalovirus, and cryptococcus. Sarcoidosis is confused most commonly with neoplastic diseases, such as lymphoma, or with disorders characterized also by a mononuclear cell granulomatous inflammatory process, such as the mycobacterial and fungal disorders.

Chest radiograph changes are divided into four stages:
# bihilar lymphadenopathy
# bihilar lymphadenopathy and reticulonodular infiltrates
# bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
# fibrocystic sarcoidosis typically with upward hilar retraction, cystic and bullous changes
Although people with stage 1 radiographs tend to have the acute or subacute, reversible form of the disease, those with stages 2 and 3 often have the chronic, progressive disease; these patterns do not represent consecutive &quot;stages&quot; of sarcoidosis. Thus, except for epidemiologic purposes, this categorization is mostly of historic interest.

In sarcoidosis presenting in the Caucasian population, hilar adenopathy and erythema nodosum are the most common initial symptoms. In this population, a biopsy of the gastrocnemius muscle is a useful tool in correctly diagnosing the person. The presence of a noncaseating epithelioid granuloma in a gastrocnemius specimen is definitive evidence of sarcoidosis, as other tuberculoid and fungal diseases extremely rarely present histologically in this muscle.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is one modality for diagnosing cardiac sarcoidosis. It has 78% specificity in diagnosing cardiac sarcoidosis. Its T2-weighted imaging can detect acute inflammation. Meanwhile, late gadolinium contrast (LGE) can detect fibrosis or scar. Lesions at the subpericardium and midwall enhancement of basal septum or inferolateral wall is strongly suggestive of sarcoidosis. MRI can also follow up on the treatment efficacy of corticosteroids and prognosis of cardiac sarcoidosis.

PET scan is able to quantify disease activity which cannot be performed by CMR.

===Classification===
Sarcoidosis may be divided into the following types:

* Annular sarcoidosis
* Erythrodermic sarcoidosis
* Ichthyosiform sarcoidosis
* Hypopigmented sarcoidosis
* Löfgren syndrome
* Lupus pernio
* Morpheaform sarcoidosis
* Mucosal sarcoidosis
* Neurosarcoidosis
* Papular sarcoid
* Scar sarcoid
* Subcutaneous sarcoidosis
* Systemic sarcoidosis
* Ulcerative sarcoidosis
==Treatment==
Treatments for sarcoidosis vary greatly depending on the patient. At least half of patients require no systemic therapy. Most people (&gt;75%) only require symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen or aspirin. For those presenting with lung symptoms, unless the respiratory impairment is devastating, active pulmonary sarcoidosis is observed usually without therapy for two to three months; if the inflammation does not subside spontaneously, therapy is instituted.

Major categories of drug interventions include glucocorticoids, antimetabolites, biologic agents especially monoclonal anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies. Investigational treatments include specific antibiotic combinations and mesenchymal stem cells. If drug intervention is indicated, a step-wise approach is often used to explore alternatives in order of increasing side effects and to monitor potentially toxic effects.

Corticosteroids, most commonly prednisone or prednisolone, have been the standard treatment for many years. In some people, this treatment can slow or reverse the course of the disease, but other people do not respond to steroid therapy. The use of corticosteroids in mild disease is controversial because in many cases the disease remits spontaneously.

===Antimetabolites===
Antimetabolites, also categorized as steroid-sparing agents, such as azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolic acid, and leflunomide are often used as alternatives to corticosteroids. Of these, methotrexate is most widely used and studied. Methotrexate is considered a first-line treatment in neurosarcoidosis, often in conjunction with corticosteroids. Long-term treatment with methotrexate is associated with liver damage in about 10% of people and hence may be a significant concern in people with liver involvement and requires regular liver function test monitoring. Methotrexate can also lead to pulmonary toxicity (lung damage), although this is fairly uncommon and more commonly it can confound the leukopenia caused by sarcoidosis. Due to these safety concerns it is often recommended that methotrexate is combined with folic acid in order to prevent toxicity. Azathioprine treatment can also lead to liver damage. However, the risk of infection appears to be about 40% lower in those treated with methotrexate instead of azathioprine. Leflunomide is being used as a replacement for methotrexate, possibly due to its purportedly lower rate of pulmonary toxicity. Mycophenolic acid has been used successfully in uveal sarcoidosis, neurosarcoidosis (especially CNS sarcoidosis; minimally effective in sarcoidosis myopathy), and pulmonary sarcoidosis.

===Immunosuppressants===
As the granulomas are caused by collections of immune system cells, particularly T cells, there has been some success using immunosuppressants (like cyclophosphamide, cladribine, chlorambucil, and cyclosporine), immunomodulatory (pentoxifylline and thalidomide), and anti-tumor necrosis factor treatment (such as infliximab, etanercept, golimumab, and adalimumab).

In a clinical trial cyclosporine added to prednisone treatment failed to demonstrate any significant benefit over prednisone alone in people with pulmonary sarcoidosis, although there was evidence of increased toxicity from the addition of cyclosporine to the steroid treatment including infections, malignancies (cancers), hypertension, and kidney dysfunction. Likewise chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide are seldom used in the treatment of sarcoidosis due to their high degree of toxicity, especially their potential for causing malignancies. Infliximab has been used successfully to treat pulmonary sarcoidosis in clinical trials in a number of cases. Etanercept, on the other hand, has failed to demonstrate any significant efficacy in people with uveal sarcoidosis in a couple of clinical trials. Likewise golimumab has failed to show any benefit in those with pulmonary sarcoidosis. One clinical trial of adalimumab found treatment response in about half of subjects, which is similar to that seen with infliximab, but as adalimumab has better tolerability profile it may be preferred over infliximab.

===Specific organ treatments===
Ursodeoxycholic acid has been used successfully as a treatment for cases with liver involvement. Thalidomide has also been tried successfully as a treatment for treatment-resistant lupus pernio in a clinical trial, which may stem from its anti-TNF activity, although it failed to exhibit any efficacy in a pulmonary sarcoidosis clinical trial. Cutaneous disease may be successfully managed with antimalarials (such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) and the tetracycline antibiotic, minocycline. Antimalarials have also demonstrated efficacy in treating sarcoidosis-induced hypercalcemia and neurosarcoidosis. Long-term use of antimalarials is limited, however, by their potential to cause irreversible blindness and hence the need for regular ophthalmologic screening. This toxicity is usually less of a problem with hydroxychloroquine than with chloroquine, although hydroxychloroquine can disturb the glucose homeostasis.

Recently selective phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors like apremilast (a thalidomide derivative), roflumilast, and the less subtype-selective PDE4 inhibitor, pentoxifylline, have been tried as a treatment for sarcoidosis, with successful results being obtained with apremilast in cutaneous sarcoidosis in a small open-label study. Pentoxifylline has been used successfully to treat acute disease although its use is greatly limited by its gastrointestinal toxicity (mostly nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea). Case reports have supported the efficacy of rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and a clinical trial investigating atorvastatin as a treatment for sarcoidosis is under-way. ACE inhibitors have been reported to cause remission in cutaneous sarcoidosis and improvement in pulmonary sarcoidosis, including improvement in pulmonary function, remodeling of lung parenchyma and prevention of pulmonary fibrosis in separate case series&#x27;. Nicotine patches have been found to possess anti-inflammatory effects in sarcoidosis patients, although whether they had disease-modifying effects requires further investigation. Antimycobacterial treatment (drugs that kill off mycobacteria, the causative agents behind tuberculosis and leprosy) has also proven itself effective in treating chronic cutaneous (that is, it affects the skin) sarcoidosis in one clinical trial. Quercetin has also been tried as a treatment for pulmonary sarcoidosis with some early success in one small trial.

Because of its uncommon nature, the treatment of male reproductive tract sarcoidosis is controversial. Since the differential diagnosis includes testicular cancer, some recommend orchiectomy, even if evidence of sarcoidosis in other organs is present. In the newer approach, testicular, epididymal biopsy and resection of the largest lesion has been proposed.

===Symptoms===

People with sarcoidosis may have a range of symptoms that do not correspond with objective physical evidence of disease but that still decrease quality of life.

Physical therapy, rehabilitation, and counseling can help avoid deconditioning, and improve social participation, psychological well-being, and activity levels. Key aspects are avoiding exercise intolerance and muscle weakness.

Low or moderate-intensity physical training has been shown to improve fatigue, psychological health, and physical functioning in people sarcoidosis without adverse effects. Inspiratory muscle training has also decreased severe fatigue perception in subjects with early stages of sarcoidosis, as well as improving functional and maximal exercise capacity and respiratory muscle strength. The duration, frequency, and physical intensity of exercise needs to accommodate impairments such as joint pain, muscle pain, and fatigue.

Neurostimulants such as methylphenidate and modafinil have shown some effectiveness as an adjunct for treatment of sarcoidosis fatigue.

Treatments for symptomatic neuropathic pain in sarcoidosis patients is similar to that for other causes, and include antidepressants, anticonvulsants and prolonged-release opioids, however, only 30 to 60% of patients experience limited pain relief.

==Prognosis==

The disease can remit spontaneously or become chronic, with exacerbations and remissions. In some cases, it can progress to pulmonary fibrosis and death. In benign cases, remission can occur in 24 to 36 months without treatment but regular follow ups are required. Some cases, however, may persist several decades. Two-thirds of people with the condition achieve a remission within 10 years of the diagnosis. When the heart is involved, the prognosis is generally less favourable, though corticosteroids appear effective in improving AV conduction. The prognosis tends to be less favourable in African Americans than in white Americans. In a Swedish population-based analysis, the majority of cases who did not have severe disease at diagnosis had comparable mortality to the general population. The risk for premature death was markedly (2.3-fold) increased compared to the general population for a smaller group of cases with severe disease at diagnosis. Serious infections, sometimes multiple during the course of disease, and heart failure might contribute to the higher risk of early death in some patients with sarcoidosis.

Some 1990s studies indicated that people with sarcoidosis appear to be at significantly increased risk for cancer, in particular lung cancer, lymphomas, and cancer in other organs known to be affected in sarcoidosis. In sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome, sarcoidosis is followed by the development of a lymphoproliferative disorder such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This may be attributed to the underlying immunological abnormalities that occur during the sarcoidosis disease process. Sarcoidosis can also follow cancer or occur concurrently with cancer. There have been reports of hairy cell leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute myeloblastic leukemia associated with sarcoidosis. Sometimes, sarcoidosis, even untreated, can be complicated by opportunistic infections although these are rare.

==Epidemiology==
Sarcoidosis most commonly affects young adults of both sexes, although studies have reported more cases in females. Incidence is highest for individuals younger than 40 and peaks in the age-group from 20 to 29 years; a second peak is observed for women over 50.

Sarcoidosis occurs throughout the world in all races with an average incidence of 16.5 per 100,000 in men and 19 per 100,000 in women. The disease is most common in Northern European countries and the highest annual incidence of 60 per 100,000 is found in Sweden and Iceland. In the United Kingdom the prevalence is 16 in 100,000. In the United States, sarcoidosis is more common in people of African descent than Caucasians, with annual incidence reported as 35.5 and 10.9 per 100,000, respectively. Sarcoidosis is less commonly reported in South America, Spain, India, Canada, and the Philippines. There may be a higher susceptibility to sarcoidosis in those with celiac disease. An association between the two disorders has been suggested.

There also has been a seasonal clustering observed in sarcoidosis-affected individuals. In Greece about 70% of diagnoses occur between March and May every year, in Spain about 50% of diagnoses occur between April and June, and in Japan it is mostly diagnosed during June and July.

The differing incidence across the world may be at least partially attributable to the lack of screening programs in certain regions of the world, and the overshadowing presence of other granulomatous diseases, such as tuberculosis, that may interfere with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis where they are prevalent. There may also be differences in the severity of the disease between people of different ethnicities. Several studies suggest the presentation in people of African origin may be more severe and disseminated than for Caucasians, who are more likely to have asymptomatic disease. Manifestation appears to be slightly different according to race and sex. Erythema nodosum is far more common in men than in women and in Caucasians than in other races. In Japanese people, ophthalmologic and cardiac involvement are more common than in other races.

It is more common in certain occupations, namely firefighters, educators, military personnel, those who work in industries where pesticides are used, law enforcement, and healthcare personnel. In the year after the September 11 attacks, the rate of sarcoidosis incidence went up four-fold (to 86 cases per 100,000).

==History==

It was first described in 1877 by Dr. Jonathan Hutchinson, a dermatologist as a condition causing red, raised rashes on the face, arms, and hands. In 1889 the term lupus pernio was coined by Dr. Ernest Besnier, another dermatologist. Later in 1892 lupus pernio&#x27;s histology was defined. In 1902 bone involvement was first described by a group of three doctors. Between 1909 and 1910 uveitis in sarcoidosis was first described, and later in 1915 it was emphasised, by Dr. Jörgen Nielsen Schaumann, that it was a systemic condition. This same year lung involvement was also described. In 1937 uveoparotid fever was first described and likewise in 1941 Löfgren syndrome was first described. In 1958 the first international conference on sarcoidosis was called in London, likewise the first USA sarcoidosis conference occurred in Washington, D.C., in the year 1961. It has also been called Besnier–Boeck disease or Besnier–Boeck–Schaumann disease.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;sarcoidosis&quot; comes from Greek [σάρκο-] &quot;sarco-&quot; meaning &quot;flesh&quot;, the suffix &quot;-(e)ido&quot; (from the Greek εἶδος -eidos [usually omitting the initial e in English as the diphthong epsilon-iota in Classic Greek stands for a long &quot;i&quot; = English ee]) meaning &quot;type&quot;, &quot; resembles&quot; or &quot;like&quot;, and &quot;-sis&quot;, a common suffix in Greek meaning &quot;condition&quot;. Thus the whole word means &quot;a condition that resembles crude flesh&quot;. The first cases of sarcoïdosis, which were recognised as a new pathological entity, in Scandinavia, at the end of the 19th century exhibited skin nodules resembling cutaneous sarcomas, hence the name initially given.

==Society and culture==
The World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders (WASOG) is an organisation of physicians involved in the diagnosis and treatment of sarcoidosis and related conditions. WASOG publishes the journal &quot;Sarcoidosis, Vasculitis and Diffuse Lung Diseases&quot;. Additionally, the Foundation for Sarcoidosis Research (FSR) is devoted to supporting research into sarcoidosis and its possible treatments.

There have been concerns that World Trade Center rescue workers are at a heightened risk for sarcoidosis.

Comedian and actor Bernie Mac had sarcoidosis. In 2005, he mentioned that the disease was in remission. His death on August 9, 2008, was caused by complications from pneumonia, though Mac&#x27;s agent states the sarcoidosis was not related to his fatal pneumonia.

Karen &quot;Duff&quot; Duffy, MTV personality and actress, was diagnosed with neurosarcoidosis in 1995.

American football player Reggie White died in 2004, with pulmonary and cardiac sarcoidosis being contributing factors to his fatal heart arrhythmia.

Singer Sean Levert died in 2008 of sarcoidosis complications.

Manning Marable, a professor of public policy at Columbia University, died of pneumonia in 2011, less than a year after undergoing a double lung transplant following a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. In 2012, he was posthumously awarded a Pulitzer Prize in history for his biography &quot;Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention.&quot;

Joseph Rago, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer known for his work at &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, died of sarcoidosis complications in 2017.

Several historical figures are suspected of having sarcoidosis. In a 2014 letter to the British medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot;, it was suggested that the French Revolution leader Maximilien Robespierre may have had sarcoidosis, causing him impairment during his time as head of the Reign of Terror. The symptoms associated with Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s 1827 death have been described as possibly consistent with sarcoidosis. Author Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–1894) had a history of chronic coughs and chest complaints, and sarcoidosis has been suggested as a diagnosis.

==Pregnancy==
Sarcoidosis generally does not prevent successful pregnancy and delivery; the increase in estrogen levels during pregnancy may even have a slightly beneficial immunomodulatory effect. In most cases, the course of the disease is unaffected by pregnancy, with improvement in a few cases and worsening of symptoms in very few cases, although a number of the immunosuppressants (such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide) used in corticosteroid-refractory sarcoidosis are known teratogens. Increased risks associated with sarcoidosis ranging from 30 to 70% have been reported for preeclampsia/eclampsia, cesarian or preterm delivery as well as (non-cardiac) birth defects in first singleton pregnancies. In absolute numbers, birth defects and other complications such as maternal death, cardiac arrest, placental abruption or venous thromboembolism are extremely rare in sarcoidosis pregnancies.

<text>Allen Newell (March 19, 1927 – July 19, 1992) was an American researcher in computer science and cognitive psychology at the RAND Corporation and at Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s School of Computer Science, Tepper School of Business, and Department of Psychology. He, Herbert A. Simon, and Cliff Shaw contributed to the Information Processing Language (1956) and two of the earliest AI programs, the Logic Theorist (1956) and the General Problem Solver (1957). He and Simon were awarded the ACM&#x27;s A.M. Turing Award in 1975 for their contributions to artificial intelligence and the psychology of human cognition.

== Early studies ==
Newell completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics from Stanford in 1949. He was a graduate student at Princeton University from 1949 to 1950, where he studied mathematics. Due to his early exposure to an unknown field known as game theory and the experiences from the study of mathematics, he was convinced that he would prefer a combination of experimental and theoretical research to pure mathematics. 

In 1950, he left Princeton and joined the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica where he worked for &quot;a group that was studying logistics problems of the Air Force&quot;. His work with Joseph Kruskal led to the creation of two theories: A Model for Organization Theory and Formulating Precise Concepts in Organization Theory. Newell eventually earned his PhD from the now Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon with Herbert Simon serving as his advisor.

Afterwards, Newell &quot;turned to the design and conduct of laboratory experiments on decision making in small groups&quot;. He was dissatisfied, however, with the accuracy and validity of their findings produced from small-scale laboratory experiments. He joined with fellow RAND teammates John Kennedy, Bob Chapman, and Bill Biel at an Air Force Early Warning Station to study organizational processes in flight crews. They received funding from the Air Force in 1952 to build a simulator that would enable them to examine and analyze the interactions in the cockpit related to decision-making and information-handling. From these studies, Newell came to believe that information processing is the central activity in organizations.

==Artificial intelligence==
In September 1954, Newell enrolled in a seminar where Oliver Selfridge &quot;described a running computer program that learned to recognize letters and other patterns&quot;. This was when Allen came to believe that systems may be created and contain intelligence and have the ability to adapt. With this in mind, Allen, after a couple of months, wrote in 1955 &quot;The Chess Machine: An Example of Dealing with a Complex Task by Adaptation&quot;, which &quot;outlined an imaginative design for a computer program to play chess in humanoid fashion&quot;.

His work came to the attention of economist (and future nobel laureate) Herbert A. Simon, and, together with programmer J. C. Shaw, they developed the first true artificial intelligence program(see notes), the Logic Theorist. Newell&#x27;s work on the program laid the foundations of the field. His inventions included: list processing, the most important programming paradigm used by AI ever since; the application of means-ends analysis to general reasoning (or &quot;reasoning as search&quot;); and the use of heuristics to limit the search space.

They presented the program at the Dartmouth conference of 1956, an informal gathering of researchers who were interested in simulating intelligence with machines. The conference, now widely considered the &quot;birth of artificial intelligence&quot;, was enormously influential and those who attended became the leaders of AI research for the next two decades, Newell included.

==Later achievements==
Newell and Simon formed a lasting partnership. They founded an artificial intelligence laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University and produced a series of important programs and theoretical insights throughout the late fifties and sixties. This work included the General Problem Solver, a highly influential implementation of means–ends analysis, and the physical symbol systems hypothesis, the controversial philosophical assertion that all intelligent behavior could be reduced to the kind of symbol manipulation that Newell&#x27;s programs demonstrated.

Newell&#x27;s work culminated in the development of a cognitive architecture known as Soar and his unified theory of cognition, published in 1990, but their improvement was the objective of his efforts up to his death (one of the last Newell&#x27;s letters ). The field of cognitive architectures, that he initiated, is still active in both the artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science communities.

<doc id="287301" wikidata="Q7187757" url="?curid=287301" title="Photoflash capacitor">
<text>A photoflash capacitor is a high-voltage electrolytic capacitor used in camera flashes and in solid-state laser power supplies. Their usual purpose is to briefly power a flash lamp, used to illuminate a photographic subject or optically pump a laser rod. As flash tubes require very high current for a very short time to operate, photoflash capacitors are designed to supply high discharge current pulses without excessive internal heating.

== Fundamentals ==
The principal properties of a capacitor are capacitance, working voltage, equivalent series resistance (ESR), equivalent series inductance (ESL), and working temperature

Compared with electrolytic capacitors usually used for power supply filtering at power frequency, a photoflash capacitor is designed to have lower ESR, ESL, and capacitance manufacturing tolerance, but does not need as high a working temperature.

== Design ==
The light energy emitted by a flash is supplied by the capacitor, and is proportional to the product of the capacitance and the voltage squared; photoflash capacitors may have capacitance in the range 80-240 microfarads (μF) and voltages from 180 to 330 volts for flash units built into small disposable and compact cameras, increasing for units delivering higher light energy. A typical manufacturer&#x27;s range includes capacitors operating at 330–380V, with capacitance from 80 to 1,500 μF While normal electrolytic capacitors are often operated at not more than half their nominal voltage due to their high derating, photoflash capacitors are typically operated at their nominal working voltage (labelled as &quot;WV&quot; or &quot;W.V.&quot; rather than just &quot;V&quot;).

Photoflash capacitors are not subject to the high temperatures of cased electronic equipment in continuous operation, with nearby components and sometimes the capacitors themselves dissipating heat; they are often rated at a maximum operating temperature rate of typically 55 °C, compared to 85 °C–105 °C or more for capacitors for continuous use in electronic equipment. In most electronic applications an electrolytic capacitor can have a capacitance much larger than its nominal value without detracting from circuit performance; general-purpose electrolytics are often specified to have capacitance between 20% below and 80% above rated value, although tighter tolerances are available. The light energy of a flash is proportional to the capacitance and large variations are not acceptable, typical tolerance is -10+20%.

Photoflash capacitors are designed to deliver a brief pulse of very high current, and are consequently sometimes used in railgun and coilgun designs.

<doc id="287311" wikidata="Q324342" url="?curid=287311" title="All Hail, Liberia, Hail!">
<text>&quot;All Hail, Liberia, Hail!&quot; is the national anthem of Liberia. The lyrics were written by Daniel Bashiel Warner (1815–1880), who later became the third president of Liberia, and the music was composed by Olmstead Luca (1826–1869). It became the official national anthem upon Liberia&#x27;s independence in 1847.

==History==
=== 1974 proposed change to lyrics ===
On 22 July 1974, the Legislature of Liberia passed an act giving authorization to the president to establish a commission to give consideration to possible changes to a number of national symbols, including &quot;All Hail, Liberia, Hail!&quot; and the flag. President William Tolbert appointed 51 members to the Commission on National Unity. The commission was headed by McKinley Alfred Deshield Sr., and was also called the Deshield Commission. The commission sought to reexamine the symbols and remove divisive aspects of them. The commission submitted their report on 24 January 1978. The report recommended changing the word &quot;benighted&quot; in the anthem to the word &quot;undaunted&quot;. The proposed change to the anthem was never made.

<doc id="287314" wikidata="Q336374" url="?curid=287314" title="Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava">
<text>Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, (21 June 182612 February 1902), was a British public servant and prominent member of Victorian society. In his youth he was a popular figure in the court of Queen Victoria, and became well known to the public after publishing a best-selling account of his travels in the North Atlantic.

He is now best known as one of the most successful public servants of his time. His long career in public service began as a commissioner to Syria in 1860, where his skilful diplomacy maintained British interests while preventing France from instituting a client state in Lebanon. After his success in Syria, Dufferin served in the Government of the United Kingdom as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Under-Secretary of State for War. In 1872 he became Governor General of Canada, bolstering imperial ties in the early years of the Dominion, and in 1884 he reached the pinnacle of his official career as Viceroy of India.

He served as ambassador to France from 1891 to 1896. Following his retirement from the diplomatic service in 1896, his final years were marred by personal tragedy and a misguided attempt to secure his family&#x27;s financial position. His eldest son was killed in the Second Boer War and another son was badly wounded. He was chairman of a mining firm that went bankrupt after swindling people, although he was ignorant of the matter. His biographer Davenport-Hines says he was &quot;imaginative, sympathetic, warm-hearted, and gloriously versatile.&quot; He was an effective leader in Lebanon, Canada and India, averted war with Russia, and annexed Burma. He was careless with money but charming in high society on three continents.

==Early life==
He was born Frederick Temple Blackwood into &quot;the Ascendancy&quot;, Ireland&#x27;s Anglo-Irish aristocracy, the son of Price Blackwood, 4th Baron Dufferin and Claneboye. On his father&#x27;s side, Dufferin was descended from Scottish settlers who had moved to County Down in the early 17th century. The Blackwood family became prominent landowners in Ulster over the following two hundred years, and were created baronets in 1763, entering the Peerage of Ireland in 1800 as Baron Dufferin. The family had influence in parliament because they controlled the return for the borough of Killyleagh. Marriages in the Blackwood family were often advantageous to their landowning and high-society ambitions. His mother, Helen Selina Sheridan, was the granddaughter of the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan and through her, the family became connected to English literary and political circles.

Dufferin was born in 1826 in Florence, then the capital of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in the Italian peninsula, with great advantages. He was educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he became president of the Oxford Union Society for debate, although he left Oxford after only two years without obtaining a degree. While still an Oxford undergraduate, he visited Skibbereen in County Cork to see the impact of the Irish Famine first-hand. He was appalled by what he saw, prompting him to raise money on behalf of the starving poor. In 1841, while still at school, he succeeded his father as Baron Dufferin and Claneboye in the Peerage of Ireland and in 1849 was appointed a Lord-in-Waiting to Queen Victoria. In 1850 he was additionally created Baron Claneboye, of Clandeboye in the County of Down, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He inherited 18,000 acres in County Down.

In 1856, Dufferin commissioned the schooner &quot;Foam&quot; and set off on a journey around the North Atlantic. He first made landfall on Iceland, where he visited the then very small Reykjavík, the plains of Þingvellir, and Geysir. Returning to Reykjavík, &quot;Foam&quot; was towed north by Prince Napoleon, who was on an expedition to the region in the steamer La Reine Hortense. Dufferin sailed close to Jan Mayen Island, but was unable to land there due to heavy ice and caught only a very brief glimpse of the island through the fog. From Jan Mayen, &quot;Foam&quot; sailed on to northern Norway, stopping at Hammerfest before sailing for Spitzbergen.

On his return, Dufferin published a book about his travels, &quot;Letters From High Latitudes&quot;. With its irreverent style and lively pace, it was extremely successful and can be regarded as the prototype of the comic travelogue. It remained in print for many years and was translated into French, German and Urdu. The letters were nominally written to his mother, with whom he had developed a very close relationship after the death of his father when he was 15.

==A natural diplomat==
Despite the great success of &quot;Letters From High Latitudes&quot;, Dufferin did not pursue a career as an author, although he was known for his skilful writing throughout his career. Instead, he became a public servant, with his first major public appointment in 1860 as British representative on a commission to Syria to investigate the causes of a civil war earlier that year in which the Maronite Christian population had been subject to massacres by the Muslim and Druze populations. In light of this work in June 1861 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. Working with French, Russian, Prussian and Turkish representatives on the commission, Dufferin proved remarkably successful in achieving the objectives of British policy in the area. He upheld Turkish rule in the area, and prevented the French from establishing a client state in Lebanon, later securing the removal of a French occupying force in Syria. He also defended the interests of the Druze community, with whom Britain had a long association. The other parties on the commission were inclined to repress the Druze population, but Dufferin argued that had the Christians won the war they would have been just as bloodthirsty. The long-term plan agreed by the commission for the governance of the region was largely that proposed by Dufferin — that Lebanon should be governed separately from the rest of Syria, by a Christian Ottoman who was not a native of Syria. He was appointed a Knight of the Order of Saint Patrick on 28 January 1864.

Dufferin&#x27;s achievements in Syria launched his long and successful career in public service. In 1864 he became Under-Secretary of State for India, moving to Under-Secretary of War in 1866, and from 1868 he held the position of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in Prime Minister Gladstone&#x27;s government. In 1871 he was raised in the Peerage as Earl of Dufferin, in the County of Down, and Viscount Claneboye, of Clandeboye in the County of Down.

==Family==

Lord Dufferin took the name &quot;Hamilton&quot; by royal licence on 9 September 1862, shortly before his marriage to Hariot Georgina Rowan-Hamilton on 23 October 1862. He was distantly related to the Hamilton family by previous marriages, and the union was partly designed to eliminate some long-standing hostilities between the families. Dufferin also took the name of &quot;Temple&quot;, on 13 November 1872. They had seven surviving children; the two youngest, a son and a daughter, were born in Canada:

*Archibald James Leofric Temple Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, Earl of Ava (28 July 186311 January 1900), was a lieutenant in the 17th Lancers and a fellow of the Royal Colonial Institute. He was a war correspondent in South Africa during the Second Boer War and was wounded at Wagon Hill during the Siege of Ladysmith. Lord Ava died a week later. He was unmarried.
*Lady Helen Hermione Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood (1865–9 April 1941), GBE (1918), LLD, JP for Fife, was married on 31 August 1889 to Ronald Munro Ferguson (later 1st and last Viscount Novar), who later became Governor-General of Australia. They had no issue.
*Terence Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 2nd Marquess of Dufferin and Ava (16 March 18667 February 1918). Married and had issue, three daughters.
*Lady Hermione Catherine Helen Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood (1869–19 October 1960) trained as a nurse and qualified in 1901, serving in France during the First World War. She was awarded the Médaille de la Reconnaissance française for her services. She died unmarried.
*Lord Ian Basil Gawaine Temple Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood (4 November 18703 July 1917) was a barrister-at-law. He was at Balliol College, Oxford in 1891 and became part of the &#x27;kindergarten&#x27; of Lord Milner. He was appointed Deputy Judge Advocate in South Africa in 1900, secretary to the High Commissioner to South Africa in 1902, Assistant Colonial Secretary in the Orange River Colony in 1903, Colonial Secretary in Barbados from 1907 to 1909 and Assistant Secretary to the Land Development Commission of England from 1910 to 1914. He was attached to the 9th Lancers and Intelligence Corps from 1914 to 1916 and then appointed Private Secretary to Ivor Churchill Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in 1916. He returned to active service as a lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards and was killed in action in 1917. His most prominent legacy is the corpus of drawings he did for Hilaire Belloc&#x27;s books (over the signature `BTB&#x27;). He was unmarried.
*Lady Victoria Alexandrina Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood (1873–1938), whose chief sponsor at her christening was Queen Victoria, was married firstly in 1894 to William Lee Plunket, 5th Baron Plunket and had eight children by him, and secondly to Colonel Francis Powell Braithwaite CBE DSO. Her son Terence Conyngham Plunket, 6th Baron Plunket was married to Dorothé Mabel Lewis, the illegitimate daughter of Charles Stewart Henry Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 7th Marquess of Londonderry, and both were killed in an aircraft accident in 1938, while her younger son Flight Lieutenant the Honourable Brinsley Sheridan Bushe Plunket was married in 1927 to Aileen Guinness, the sister of Maureen Guinness, who was later to marry Basil Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 4th Marquess of Dufferin and Ava. Terence and Dorothé&#x27;s eldest son Patrick Terence William Span Plunket, 7th Baron Plunket was an equerry to The Queen and Deputy Master of the Household, and their second son was Robin Rathmore Plunket, 8th Baron Plunket.
*Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 3rd Marquess of Dufferin and Ava (26 February 187521 July 1930)
*In addition, they had a son, Sydney Temple Blackwood, who was born on 29 May 1867, but died the same day. His gravestone stands at St Katherine&#x27;s Church, in Friern Barnet Lane, London:

Shortly after his marriage, he was deeply upset when his mother married his friend George Hay, Earl of Gifford, a man some 17 years her junior. The marriage scandalised society, but Lord Gifford died only weeks afterwards. Despite his disapproval of his mother&#x27;s second marriage, Lord Dufferin was devastated by her death in 1867, and built Helen&#x27;s Tower, a memorial to her, on the estate at Clandeboye. A nearby bay was also named Helen&#x27;s Bay, and a railway station of that name was built there by him, seeding the growth of the modern Belfast commuter town of Helen&#x27;s Bay.

==Governor General of Canada==

After his mother&#x27;s death, Dufferin&#x27;s diplomatic career advanced rapidly. He became Governor General of Canada in 1872, and his six-year tenure was a period of rapid change in Canadian history. During his term, Prince Edward Island was admitted to Confederation, and several well-known Canadian institutions, such as the Supreme Court of Canada, the Royal Military College of Canada, and the Intercolonial Railway, were established.

In Dufferin&#x27;s opinion, his two predecessors in the post had not given the position the prominence it deserved. He consciously set out to assume a more active role, and to get to know ordinary Canadians as much as possible. He was at ease speaking with a wide variety of people, both in English and French, and became known for his charm and hospitality. At a time when a weak or uncharismatic Governor General might have loosened the ties to Empire, Dufferin felt that involving himself with the people of Canada would strengthen constitutional links to Britain. He visited every Canadian province, and was the first Governor General to visit Manitoba. He took a keen interest in the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards, organized in 1872.

Lord Dufferin involved himself as much as was permissible in Canadian politics, even going so far as to advise ministers to abandon policies which he thought were mistaken. He followed proceedings in the Parliament with interest, although as the Queen&#x27;s representative, he was barred from entering the House of Commons. He established an Office of the Governor General in a wing of the Parliament buildings, and Lady Dufferin attended many debates and reported back to him. In 1873, the Pacific scandal arose when the Conservative government of John A. Macdonald was accused by the Liberal opposition of financial impropriety in relation to the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Dufferin prorogued parliament, and established an enquiry which found against the Government, and Macdonald fell from power.

In 1873, Dufferin established the Governor General&#x27;s Academic Medals for superior academic achievement by Canadian students. These medals are the most prestigious that school students can be awarded, and more than 50,000 have been awarded. He also instituted several sporting prizes, including the Governor General&#x27;s Match for shooting, and the Governor General&#x27;s Curling Trophy.

Dufferin made several extensions and improvements to Rideau Hall, the Governor General&#x27;s official residence. He added a ballroom in 1873, and in 1876 built the Tent Room to accommodate the increasing number of functions being held at the Hall. He also attracted ordinary Canadians to the Hall grounds by constructing an ice skating rink, to which he contributed of his own money, which was later reimbursed by the government. Public use of the rink was on condition of being &quot;properly dressed&quot;. These additions enhanced Rideau Hall&#x27;s role as an important centre of social affairs.

The Dufferins also made extensive use of the Citadel of Quebec in Quebec City as a second vice-regal residence, having developed a strong attachment to the city and its significant historical ties with the British Empire. When Quebec city officials began to demolish the old city walls, Dufferin was appalled, persuading them to stop the demolition, and to repair and restore what had already been damaged (Old Quebec was eventually recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1985). Dufferin&#x27;s final public appearance as Governor General was in Quebec City, to lay the foundation stone for Dufferin Terrace, an expansive walkway overlooking the St Lawrence River built to his own design and arguably his best-known legacy in Canada In 1876 he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG).

Lady Dufferin also maintained a high profile during her husband&#x27;s term as Governor General, accompanying him on tours and frequently appearing in public. Visiting Manitoba in September 1877, Lord and Lady Dufferin each drove a spike in the line of the new Canadian Pacific Railway, and the first engine on the railway was christened &quot;Lady Dufferin&quot;. Throughout her time in Canada, Lady Dufferin wrote letters to her mother in Ireland, which were later collected and published as &quot;My Canadian Journal&quot;. She later said that of all her experiences, her happiest times had been spent in Canada.

The popularity and influence of the Dufferins in Canada is reflected by the large number of Canadian schools, streets and public buildings named after them. Lord Dufferin is particularly well remembered in Manitoba, being the first Governor General to visit the province; a statue of him is outside the provincial legislature.

==Russia and Turkey (1879–84)==
After leaving Ottawa in 1878 at the end of his term, Dufferin returned to Great Britain to continue his diplomatic career. He served as ambassador to Imperial Russia from 1879 to 1881 and to the Ottoman Empire from 1881 to 1884. Although he had previously served in Liberal governments, Dufferin had become increasingly alienated from William Ewart Gladstone over issues of home and Irish policy, particularly the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870 and the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881, both of which tried to resolve issues surrounding the property rights of tenants and landlords. He accepted the appointment as ambassador to Russia from the Conservative Benjamin Disraeli, further alienating the Liberal leader.

Dufferin&#x27;s time in Russia was quiet from a political and diplomatic point of view, and his papers from this time are concerned mainly with his social life. While in Russia, he began to set his sights on the ultimate diplomatic prize, the Viceroyalty of India. However, Lord Ripon succeeded Lord Lytton in 1880, largely because as a convert to Roman Catholicism, Ripon could not be accommodated in the Cabinet. Instead, Dufferin&#x27;s next diplomatic posting was to Constantinople.

His posting there saw Britain invade and occupy Egypt, then technically part of the Ottoman Empire, under the pretext of &quot;restoring law and order&quot; following anti-foreign riots in Alexandria which had left nearly 50 foreigners dead, and Dufferin was heavily involved in the events surrounding the occupation. Dufferin managed to ensure that the Ottoman Empire did not attain a military foothold in Egypt, and placated the population of Egypt by preventing the execution of Urabi Pasha, who had seized control of the Egyptian army. Urabi had led the resistance to foreign influence in Egypt, and after the occupation, many in the Cabinet were keen to see him hanged. Dufferin, believing this would only inspire further resistance, instead ensured that Urabi was exiled to Ceylon.

In 1882 Dufferin travelled to Egypt as British commissioner, to investigate the reorganization of the country. He wrote a report (known as the Dufferin Report) detailing how the occupation was to benefit Egypt, with plans for development which were to progressively re-involve Egyptians in running the country. Subsequent reforms proceeded largely along the lines he had proposed. He was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (civil division) on 15 June 1883.

==Viceroy of India (1884–88)==
His experiences in Russia and Turkey had further increased his awareness of the British Empire&#x27;s place in international affairs, and his time in Russia had provided great insight into the Russian threat to British rule in India. In 1884, he finally achieved his last great diplomatic ambition with his appointment as Viceroy of India. As such, he was ex officio Grand Master and Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) and Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire, though he was not appointed GCIE until 1887.

Just as in Canada, he presided over some great changes in India. His predecessor as Viceroy, Lord Ripon, while popular with the Indians, was very unpopular with the Anglo-Indians, who objected to the rapid pace of his extensive reforms. To rule with any success, Dufferin would need to gain the support of both communities. By all accounts, he was highly successful in this regard, and gained substantial support from all communities in India. He advanced the cause of the Indian Nationalists greatly during his term, without antagonising the conservative whites. Among other things, the Indian National Congress was founded during his term in 1885, and he laid the foundations for the modern Indian Army by establishing the Imperial Service Corps, officered by Indians.

He was frequently occupied with external affairs during his tenure. He handled the Panjdeh Incident of 1885 in Afghanistan, in which Russian forces encroached into Afghan territory around the Panjdeh oasis. Britain and Russia had for decades been engaged in a virtual cold war in Central Asia and India, known as the Great Game, and the Panjdeh incident threatened to precipitate a full-blown conflict. Dufferin negotiated a settlement in which Russia kept Panjdeh but relinquished the furthest territories it had taken in its advance. His tenure also saw the annexation of Upper Burma in 1886, after many years of simmering warfare and British interventions in Burmese politics.

In 1888, he published the &quot;Report on the Conditions of the Lower Classes of Population in Bengal&quot; (known as the Dufferin Report). The report highlighted the plight of the poor in Bengal, and was used by nationalists to counter the Anglo-Indian claim that British rule had been beneficial to the poorest members of Indian society. Following publication of the report, Dufferin recommended the establishment of provincial and central councils with Indian membership, a key demand of Congress at that time.

His time as Viceroy of India featured in the Rudyard Kipling poem &#x27;One Viceroy Resigns&#x27;, which was written from Dufferin&#x27;s point of view, giving advice to his successor, Lord Lansdowne.

His wife Lady Dufferin, Vicereine of India, accompanied her husband on his travels in India and made her own name as a pioneer in the medical training of women in India. Her extensive travel writings and photographs, in addition to her medical work, challenge some traditional assumptions about the role of women in colonial life.

==Later life==
Following his return from India, Dufferin resumed his ambassadorial career, serving as ambassador to Italy from 1888 to 1891. On 17 November 1888, he was advanced in the peerage as Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, in the County of Down and the Province of Burma, and Earl of Ava, in the Province of Burma. As ambassador to France from 1891 to 1896, he presided over some difficult times in Anglo-French relations, and was accused by some sections of the French press of trying to undermine Franco-Russian relations. During this time he helped establish the Anglo-French Guild which has since evolved into the University of London Institute in Paris (ULIP). After returning from France, Dufferin became President of the Royal Geographical Society, and Rector of the University of Edinburgh and the University of St Andrews. He received the honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901.

Throughout his life, Dufferin was known for living beyond his means and had heavily mortgaged his estates to fund his lifestyle and improvements to the estates. In 1875, with his debts approaching £300,000, he was facing insolvency and was forced to sell substantial amounts of land to pay off his creditors. After he retired from the diplomatic service in 1896, he received several offers from financial speculators hoping to use his high reputation to attract investors to their companies. In 1897, worried about the family&#x27;s financial situation, he was persuaded to become chairman of the London and Globe Finance Corporation, a mining promotion and holding company controlled by Whitaker Wright, but in November 1900 shares in the company crashed and led to its insolvency. It subsequently transpired that Wright was a consummate fraudster. Dufferin lost substantial money on his holdings in the company, but was not guilty of any deception and his moral standing remained unaffected.

Soon after this misfortune, Dufferin&#x27;s eldest son, Lord Ava, was killed in the Boer War. Dufferin returned to his country house at Clandeboye, near Bangor, in poor health, and died on 12 February 1902. Lady Dufferin died on 25 October 1936.

==Dufferin and the ghost==
Dufferin often told a tale of how he once saw a ghost which saved his life. Late one night in 1849, while staying in a house in Tullamore, County Offaly, Ireland, he heard a hearse draw up, and looked down and saw a man walking across the lawn carrying a coffin on his back. The man stopped and looked up at Dufferin and their eyes met for a moment, before he continued on into the shadows and disappeared. Dufferin thought the whole event might have been just a bad dream, but the next morning his hostess assured him that the next time he saw the apparition, he would die.

Some years later Dufferin – by this point, the British ambassador to France – recognised the lift operator at the Grand Hotel in Paris as the man he had seen in the garden in Ireland. He refused to get into the lift and a moment later it crashed, killing the occupants including the mysterious man, who had only begun work at the hotel that morning.

French journalist Paul Heuzé demonstrated that up to the time of his research in 1922, only one person had been killed in a Grand Hotel lift accident, in 1878, years before Dufferin was in Paris. A more recent investigation by BBC researcher Melvin Harris demonstrated that the story was an urban legend which Dufferin improved upon by telling as a personal anecdote.

The story itself was retold by E. F. Benson in his short story &quot;The Bus-Conductor&quot; in 1906, and was adapted in a segment of the anthology film, &quot;Dead of Night&quot;. It was again retold by Bennett Cerf in his collection &quot;Famous Ghost Stories&quot; in 1944, which in turn was adapted in the episode &quot;Twenty Two&quot; of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It was again published in &quot;Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark&quot;.

<text>Kristanna Loken (born October 8, 1979) is an American actress, model and director. After her modelling career, in which she participated in the 1994 Elite Model Look, Loken started her acting career in 1994 as the third actress to play Danielle &#x27;Dani&#x27; Andropoulos on an episode of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. She later appeared in several television shows and films, such as &quot;Mortal Kombat: Conquest&quot; and &quot;Air Panic&quot; (2001). Her breakthrough role was as the gynoid T-X in &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; (2003), for which she was nominated for two Saturn Awards. She has since starred in films such as &quot;BloodRayne&quot; (2005), in which she portrayed Rayne, &quot;Bounty Killer&quot; (2013), and &quot;Darkness of Man &quot; (2024), as well as the TV series &quot;Painkiller Jane&quot; (2007), &quot;The L Word&quot; (2007–2008) and &quot;Burn Notice&quot; (2011–2012).

==Early life==
Loken was born October 8, 1979, in Ghent, New York, to parents from a Norwegian community in Wisconsin. She is the daughter of Rande (née Porath), a model, and Merlin &quot;Chris&quot; Loken, a writer, apple farmer, and former Broadway and Hollywood actor. Loken has a sister named Tanya. Loken is of Norwegian descent from her great-grandparents, and her grandparents also spoke Norwegian. Regarding her ethnic heritage, Loken indicated in a 2003 interview that she calls herself both Norwegian and American, saying, &quot;We follow many of the Norwegian traditions...the holidays, especially at Christmas. This is something I hope to keep going when I have a family of my own.&quot; In a 2006 interview she also mentioned German heritage, stating, &quot;I do have Norwegian blood, with a little bit of German in there.&quot; She grew up in a town in Upstate New York, and took her first trip to Norway at age 12.

==Career==
Loken&#x27;s mother encouraged her to become a model. She participated at the 1994 Elite Model Look, placing third runner-up. Loken started her acting career in 1994 as the third actress to play Danielle &#x27;Dani&#x27; Andropoulos on an episode of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. She later appeared in several television shows and films, including regular appearances on the television shows &quot;Philly&quot;, &quot;Unhappily Ever After&quot; and &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;.

In 1998, Loken starred in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Conquest&quot; as Taja. She played the gynoid T-X (Terminatrix) in the 2003 movie &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;. In 2004, she appeared in a German television movie, &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot; (also known as &quot;Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King&quot; or &quot;Sword of Xanten&quot;), which aired as a two-part miniseries and set a ratings record. She starred as the leading character in the 2006 film adaptation of the video game &quot;BloodRayne&quot;, and appeared in director Uwe Boll&#x27;s film adaptation of the video game &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot;, called &quot;In the Name of the King&quot;.

She appeared in 10 episodes of the fourth season of &quot;The L Word&quot;, which debuted in January 2007. Additionally, she starred as the title character in the Sci-Fi Channel&#x27;s series &quot;Painkiller Jane&quot; which aired from April to September 2007. In December 2011, Loken appeared in the fifth-season finale of the USA Network TV series &quot;Burn Notice&quot; as CIA agent Rebecca Lang, and would reprise that role in three sixth-season episodes during mid-2012.

In 2014, she starred in the action movie &quot;Mercenaries&quot;, alongside Cynthia Rothrock, Brigitte Nielsen, Vivica A. Fox, Zoë Bell and Nicole Bilderback.

In 2017, she co-starred in the romantic thriller film &quot;Body of Deceit&quot;, alongside Sarai Givaty.

==Personal life==
Loken is bisexual. She stated in an interview with &quot;Curve&quot; magazine: &quot;I have dated and have had sex with men and women and have to say that the relationships I have had with certain women have been much more fulfilling, sexually and emotionally, than of those with certain men. I connect with an aura, with energy. And if the person with whom I connect happens to be a female, that&#x27;s just the way it is. That&#x27;s what makes my wheels turn.&quot;

On January 17, 2008, Loken announced on her website she was engaged to her &quot;Painkiller Jane&quot; co-star Noah Danby; the couple exchanged marriage vows at her family&#x27;s farm on May 10, 2008. In an interview published on November 16, 2009, she announced she had separated from Danby and was dating a woman.

Loken gave birth to a son in May 2016. The father of the child is her boyfriend, JP Morgan managing director Jonathan Bates.

<text>Alfred Manuel &quot;Billy&quot; Martin Jr. (May 16, 1928 – December 25, 1989) was an American Major League Baseball second baseman and manager who, in addition to leading other teams, was five times the manager of the New York Yankees. First known as a scrappy infielder who made considerable contributions to the championship Yankee teams of the 1950s, he then built a reputation as a manager who would initially make bad teams good, before ultimately being fired amid dysfunction. In each of his stints with the Yankees he managed them to winning records before being fired by team owner George Steinbrenner or resigning under fire, usually amid a well-publicized scandal such as Martin&#x27;s involvement in an alcohol-fueled fight.

Martin was born in a working-class section of Berkeley, California. His skill as a baseball player gave him a route out of his home town. Signed by the Pacific Coast League Oakland Oaks, Martin learned much from Casey Stengel, the man who would manage him both in Oakland and in New York, and enjoyed a close relationship with Stengel. Martin&#x27;s spectacular catch of a wind-blown Jackie Robinson popup late in Game Seven of the 1952 World Series saved that series for the Yankees, and he was the hitting star of the 1953 World Series, earning the Most Valuable Player award in the Yankee victory. He missed most of two seasons, 1954 and 1955, after being drafted into the Army, and his abilities never fully returned; the Yankees traded him after a brawl at the Copacabana club in New York during the 1957 season. Martin bitterly resented being traded, and did not speak to Stengel for years, a time during which Martin completed his playing career with various teams.

The last team for whom Martin played, the Minnesota Twins, gave him a job as a scout, and he spent most of the 1960s with them, becoming a coach in 1965. After a successful managerial debut with the Twins&#x27; top minor league affiliate, the Denver Bears, Martin was made the Twins&#x27; manager in 1969. He led the club to the American League West title, but was fired after the season. He then was hired by a declining Detroit Tigers franchise in 1971, and led that team to an American League East title in 1972 before being fired by the Tigers late in the 1973 season. He was quickly hired by the Texas Rangers, and he turned them for a season (1974) into a winning team, but was fired amid conflict with ownership in 1975. He was almost immediately hired by the Yankees.

As Yankee manager, Martin led the team to consecutive American League pennants in 1976 and 1977; the Yankees were swept in the 1976 World Series by the Cincinnati Reds but triumphed over the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games in the 1977 World Series. The 1977 season saw season-long conflict between Martin and Steinbrenner, as well as between the manager and Yankee slugger Reggie Jackson, including a near brawl between the two in the dugout on national television; but the season culminated in Martin&#x27;s only world championship as a manager. He was forced to resign midway through the 1978 season after saying of Jackson and Steinbrenner, &quot;one&#x27;s a born liar, and the other&#x27;s convicted&quot;; less than a week later, the news that he would return as manager in a future season was announced to a huge ovation from the Yankee Stadium crowd. He returned in 1979, but was fired at season&#x27;s end by Steinbrenner.

From 1980 to 1982, Martin managed the Oakland Athletics, earning a division title with an aggressive style of play known as &quot;Billyball&quot; that led them to the ALCS in 1981, but he was fired after the 1982 season. He was rehired by the Yankees, whom he managed three more times, each for a season or less, and each ending in his firing by Steinbrenner. Martin died in an automobile accident in upstate New York on Christmas night in 1989. He is fondly remembered by many Yankee fans.

==Early life==
Alfred Manuel Martin Jr. was born on May 16, 1928, in Berkeley, California. He was given his father&#x27;s name; the elder Martin, usually nicknamed Al, was a truck driver for the city of Berkeley. Al Martin had been born in Kauai, Hawaii, the son of Portuguese immigrants, and had moved to Oakland. Billy Martin&#x27;s mother&#x27;s birth name was Juvan Salvini, but she went by the first name Jenny for most of her life. The daughter of Italian immigrants who had lived in San Francisco, but who moved across the Bay about the time of the 1906 earthquake, she also changed her last name, first when she married Donato Pisani around 1918, by whom she had a son, Frank, nicknamed Tudo, before the marriage broke up (Jenny later claimed that Donato had been unfaithful). There is some doubt that Jenny and Al ever married, but they lived together as a wedded couple for a time, during which Billy Martin was born at his maternal grandmother&#x27;s house in West Berkeley.

Martin acquired the name &quot;Billy&quot; as a result of his grandmother, who never mastered English, saying &quot;bello&quot; (&quot;beautiful&quot;) repeatedly over the baby, who learned his birth name only when a teacher used it at school. The Martin couple broke up soon after Billy was born, and each later accused the other of infidelity. Martin would have no further contact with his father until he was in his thirties, and the conflict between his parents likely left him with emotional wounds.

With Al Martin having returned to his native Hawaii Territory, Jenny no longer used his name, either in conversation or as part of hers, and before Billy&#x27;s first birthday, she had met John &quot;Jack&quot; Downey, a laborer and jack-of-all-trades, whom she married in late 1929, and whose name she took for herself, but not for her sons. Billy Martin later called his stepfather a &quot;great guy&quot;. Jenny always regretted that fame came to her son under the name Billy Martin, not Billy Downey.

Martin was an indifferent student and, from the age of about 12, he was often in trouble with teachers or the principal. His unusual home situation, his small size and large nose, and his residence in poverty-stricken West Berkeley caused other children to mock him, leading to conflict. Intensely competitive and thin-skinned, he quickly gained a reputation as a street fighter who would do almost anything to win.

Sports proved an outlet for Martin&#x27;s competitiveness. He boxed at an amateur level, but it was baseball that proved to be his calling. His older brother Tudo, 10 years his senior, had grown up with Augie Galan, an outfielder for the Chicago Cubs from 1934 to 1941 who continued in the major leagues until his retirement in 1949. Galan, like other professional ballplayers, made James Kenney Park in Berkeley his off-season training ground, for there was a well-maintained baseball field there. Tudo was a good enough ballplayer that he was often invited to play, and Billy would follow along. As the boy got to play more and more as he grew, Galan took a special interest in tutoring Martin in the art of baseball.

When Martin reached Berkeley High School, which he attended from 1942 to 1946, he was dressed worse than many students from the more upscale housing east of San Pablo Avenue, but gained acceptance through sports, especially baseball, raising his batting average from a poor .210 as a sophomore to an outstanding .450 as a senior. He was an aggressive player, and was involved in fights both in and out of baseball uniform. One such on-field incident his senior year led to his dismissal from the team and concerned the professional baseball teams considering signing him. He was given a workout by the Brooklyn Dodgers, but they chose another California infielder, Jackie Robinson.

The Oakland Oaks, a Pacific Coast League team, had been quietly scouting Martin for years, impressed with everything but his temper. Soon after Martin&#x27;s high school graduation, Oaks trainer Red Adams persuaded the team&#x27;s new manager, Casey Stengel, to give Martin a tryout. Stengel had seen Martin play in a high school all-star game, and though Martin did not play well, Stengel had told him that he had a future in baseball. Within weeks of the tryout, an infielder for the Oaks&#x27; Class D affiliate, the Idaho Falls Russets, was injured, and Stengel recommended that team owner Brick Laws sign Martin. Laws did so but first attempted, without success, to put a clause in the contract that would have nullified it if Martin misbehaved in a way similar to the fight that had ended his high school career.

==Playing career==
===Minor leagues===
The 18-year-old Martin was unimpressive with Idaho Falls in 1946, hitting .254 while playing mostly third base, and racking up many throwing errors. He had a good spring training with the Oaks in 1947, but was sent to the Class C Phoenix Senators of the Arizona-Texas League. Martin felt he should have remained with the Oaks, and told Stengel so. The manager&#x27;s response: &quot;Prove me wrong&quot;.

Playing mostly day games in the arid Southwest in the era before widespread air conditioning, the Senators endured harsh playing and living conditions, as many of them boarded in a barracks beyond the right field fence. Nevertheless, Martin thrived there. Wearing the uniform number 1, a number he tried to secure with each team he played for, he hit .393, the highest average in organized baseball in 1947, drove in 173 runs, and was named the league&#x27;s most valuable player. When the team&#x27;s regular second baseman was injured in a fight with opposing catcher Clint Courtney — with whom Martin would lock horns himself — Martin was moved from third base, and would remain as a second baseman for most of the remainder of his playing career. Phoenix&#x27;s season ended before that of the Oaks, and Martin was called up to the parent club. Though he did not play much, Martin won two games with doubles, and was an instant hit with the fans at Oaks Park.

When not playing, Martin closely shadowed Stengel, wanting to learn why the manager made the decisions he did. This impressed Stengel, who during his time as an outfielder for the New York Giants had sought to learn from their manager, John McGraw. Stengel and Martin grew closer in what has sometimes been described as a father-son relationship, as Stengel had no children, and Martin had been abandoned by his father. According to Martin biographer Peter Golenbock, &quot;the two men, the punk kid and the old-time ballplayer, would develop a bond that would not be broken for a decade. Binding them was their deep love for the game of baseball.&quot;

Martin made the Oaks&#x27; roster in 1948, but was slow to get regular playing time, as the Oaks had a former major-leaguer at each position and Stengel did not want to use Martin until the young ballplayer was ready. Instead, the manager had Martin sit on the bench next to him as he pointed out nuances of the game. Martin also learned about life on and off the field from his teammates.

Stengel assigned veteran players to work with Martin and be his roommate on road trips; at first Mel Duezabou, a student of the art of hitting with a lifetime minor league batting average over .300, who improved Martin at the plate. Later in the season, Duezabou was replaced with Cookie Lavagetto, a fellow infielder and former Dodgers star who was able to help Martin with fielding and advise him on what to expect in the major leagues. As injuries depleted the Oaks&#x27; regulars, Martin got increasing playing time, and finished the season with a .277 batting average, 3 home runs and 42 runs batted in. He became a team leader, active in brawls on the field and a loud and annoying bench jockey in an era when a player often had to contend with a stream of insults from the opposing team&#x27;s dugout. The Oaks won the PCL pennant and the Governors&#x27; Cup playoffs. Martin&#x27;s reward for the championship was a new car, bought by Laws, but to his distress, Stengel&#x27;s reward was the manager&#x27;s job with the New York Yankees, leaving Martin feeling abandoned. He was especially dispirited because his lifelong desire was to be a Yankee.

Stengel&#x27;s replacement with the Oaks was Charlie Dressen. Highly knowledgeable about the game, Dressen was initially wary of Martin as a Stengel favorite, but was won over by the second baseman&#x27;s hard work and desire to learn. Martin&#x27;s education continued under Dressen, as he learned such things as the art of stealing signs, and learned to try to force the other team into game-deciding mistakes. Although the team did not play as well as it had in 1948, Martin improved his statistics, hitting .286 with 12 home runs and 92 runs batted in. At the same time, Stengel, who was managing the Yankees to the 1949 American League pennant and a World Series triumph, talked of Martin to the New York press, leading many to assume he would soon be a Yankee. On October 13, 1949, Martin and fellow Oak Jackie Jensen were acquired by the Yankees.

===New York Yankees (1950–1953, 1955–1957)===

Press coverage of Martin&#x27;s sale by the Oaks to the Yankees dismissed him as a &quot;utility infielder&quot;, calling him &quot;Alfred M. Martin&quot;, a name he detested. He was among those younger Yankees players, including Whitey Ford, Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle, who reported in February 1950 to a pre-spring training instructional camp in Phoenix to work on fundamentals under Stengel&#x27;s eye. Martin hoped to become the starting second baseman for the defending world champion Yankees, but the incumbent, Jerry Coleman, had just won the American League Rookie of the League award. On reporting to spring training in St. Petersburg, Florida, he stood out for his brashness if nothing else, taking care to correct the press on how to refer to him.

Confident of Stengel&#x27;s protection, Martin sometimes defied Yankee coaches such as Frank Crosetti and Jim Turner, but won over most of his teammates as he showed his desire to learn and win, goals consistent with the &quot;Yankee Way&quot;, that individual achievement was insignificant compared to team victory. Martin made his major league debut on April 18, 1950, Opening Day, for the Yankees as they visited the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, as a pinch hitter inserted in the eighth inning with the Yankees down, 9–4, with two men on base. Martin doubled off the Green Monster in left field to drive in the runners. The Yankees batted around and in his second at-bat of the inning, he singled with the bases loaded to drive in two more runs, the first time in major league history that a player got two hits in an inning in his debut game. Despite the feat, Martin was not made an everyday player, but sat next to Stengel in the dugout, listening and learning. When he did play, he quickly became a favorite of the Yankee Stadium crowd, and they would remain loyal to him for the rest of his life.

Despite his stellar start, Martin was little-used by the Yankees in 1950 and 1951, as Coleman remained the starting second baseman. Martin was sent to the minor leagues in May 1950 to give him everyday playing experience, a decision with which he vociferously disagreed, and so stated to Yankee general manager George Weiss, an outburst that Martin always believed poisoned the relationship between himself and the team front office. He was recalled after a month, but remained mostly on the bench, with only 39 plate appearances for the Yankees in 1950, batting .250. The Yankees won the pennant again, and swept the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1950 World Series, in which Martin did not play and Coleman was the Most Valuable Player. After the season, with the Korean War raging, the 22-year-old was drafted into the army, but gained a hardship discharge after two months, something that made him less of a hero in West Berkeley. He was discharged in late April, and rejoined the Yankees, but was used sparingly, Rookie of the Year Gil McDougald absorbing what playing time at second base was not used by Coleman. Martin, wearing uniform number 1 for the Yankees for the first time, hit .259 in 51 games. Martin helped bring rookie outfielder Mickey Mantle out of his shell, introducing him to New York nightlife. In the 1951 World Series, which the Yankees won in six games over the Giants, Martin did not bat, but was inserted as a pinch runner in Game Two with the Yankees leading by a run after losing Game One. Martin scored a crucial insurance run in the Yankee victory, evading the tag from the catcher, Roy Noble, and after the game was singled out for praise by Giants manager Leo Durocher.
Coleman&#x27;s induction into the armed forces before the 1952 season opened the way for Martin to be the regular Yankee second baseman. His debut as such was delayed when he broke his ankle demonstrating the technique of sliding into second base on a television show in March, and it was not until May 12 that he made his regular season debut. Once he did, he hit .267 in 109 games, his highest as an everyday player, becoming the &quot;sparkplug&quot; that Stengel had sought for his team, energizing it. When Stengel offered $100 to any player who let himself be hit by a pitch, Martin earned $300 for the game. In the 1952 World Series against the Dodgers, Martin got 5 hits in 23 at-bats, but that included a three-run home run to break open Game Two and tie the series. In Game Four, with the Dodgers leading the Series two games to one and threatening to tie the one-run game in the fifth inning, Charlie Dressen, who was coaching third base for the Dodgers, called for the squeeze play. Martin stole the sign and the runner was out when pitcher Allie Reynolds threw a pitchout, killing the rally. In Game Seven, with the Yankees up 4–2 in the seventh inning, two outs, and the bases loaded, Jackie Robinson hit a high, wind-blown pop fly. When first baseman Joe Collins appeared to lose the ball in the sun, Martin raced in from second base, catching the ball in fair ground near home plate only inches off the grass. All three runners would most likely have scored had the ball dropped, giving the Dodgers the lead going into the eighth inning; Martin biographer David Falkner called the catch &quot;one of the great moments in World Series history&quot;.

As Yankees&#x27; regular second baseman in 1953, Martin saw his average drop to .257, but set what would be career highs with 149 games played (146 at second base), 15 home runs and 75 runs batted in. He was also ejected for the first two occasions in his career, once for arguing balls and strikes, the other for fighting. With Martin&#x27;s growing reputation as a fighter, opposing players often slid into second base hard, hoping to injure him: Stengel stated, &quot;Billy&#x27;s being hit with the hardest blocks this side of a professional football field.&quot; Nevertheless, he finished second in the league in fielding percentage among second basemen. The Yankees won their fifth consecutive pennant, and in the 1953 World Series, Martin dominated, collecting 12 hits (tying a series record) with 23 total bases (breaking Babe Ruth&#x27;s record of 19) as the Yankees beat the Dodgers in six games; Martin&#x27;s hit in the ninth inning of Game Six scored the winning run. He was elected the Series&#x27; Most Valuable Player. Stengel exulted, &quot;Look at him. He doesn&#x27;t look like a great player—but he is a helluva player. Try to find something he can&#x27;t do. You can&#x27;t.&quot;
There had been congressional investigations into whether athletes and others were given preferable treatment to avoid conscription and, in early 1954, Martin was drafted into the army, his renewed request for a hardship discharge denied. He complained to a reporter that he was given worse treatment than his fellow soldiers, allowed fewer weekend passes and not allowed to play on the Fort Ord baseball team. He missed the entire 1954 season, in which the Yankees, uniquely during Martin&#x27;s career with them, did not win the pennant, and much of the 1955 season. He was transferred to Fort Carson in Colorado, where he was allowed to live off base. He played on and managed the baseball team, and rose to the rank of corporal. In August 1955, a furlough allowed him to return to the Yankees and, when they won the pennant, it was extended for the 1955 World Series. Although Martin batted .300 for the regular season, and .320 with four runs batted in during the Series, the Yankees lost to the Dodgers in seven games, and Martin berated himself for letting down Stengel. He was discharged from the army later in October, having been awarded the Good Conduct Medal.

During the 1956 season, Weiss began to hint to the media that Martin was a poor influence on his fellow players, especially on his roommate, Mantle, with whom he often caroused until the early hours of the morning. A dignified man, Weiss did not feel that Martin fit the image he wanted for the Yankees, and may have been offended by the player&#x27;s outburst on being sent to the minors in 1950. By 1956, the Yankees were developing the next wave of infielders, including Bobby Richardson and Tony Kubek. Weiss would have liked to trade Martin, but was deterred by the fact that the second baseman was extremely popular with Yankee fans and with the press covering the team. Although Martin appeared in the 1956 All-Star Game—his only All-Star appearance as a player—his abilities as a player never fully returned after leaving the army. With Richardson progressing rapidly through the Yankee farm system, Martin worried that his days with the team were numbered. Nevertheless, he hit .264 with nine home runs for the Yankees in 1956, and in the 1956 World Series against the Dodgers, Martin played well both in the field and at the plate, getting the hit that gave the Yankees the lead for good in Game Four to tie the Series, and hitting .296 with two home runs as the Yankees won in seven games, thus finishing his World Series career as a player with a .333 batting average.
Weiss warned Martin before the 1957 season to avoid trouble, and the infielder did nothing to aid his own cause by injuring both himself and Mantle (the reigning MVP) in an intentional collision between their golf carts as they played a round on a Florida course during spring training. While Martin recovered from this and other injuries, Bobby Richardson played, showing a fielding range that Martin no longer possessed. But the incident that gave Weiss the leeway to trade Martin was a brawl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York on May 16. Although it was fellow Yankee Hank Bauer who was accused of throwing the first punch, Martin believed that Weiss would blame him, and as the trade deadline of June 15 approached, his foreboding and tension grew. Stories differ about how Martin learned he had been traded to the Kansas City A&#x27;s on the trade deadline: biographer David Falkner stated that Martin, out of the lineup in the game at Kansas City&#x27;s Municipal Stadium, was informed by farm director Lee MacPhail, and that Stengel refused to see Martin, but Martin in his autobiography alleged that he had been sitting in the bullpen and that Stengel came to inform him. Marty Appel, in his biography of Stengel, stated that Martin was called in to see Stengel, was told of the trade, and Martin blamed the manager for not preventing it. According to Appel, &quot;No one had worn the Yankees uniform more proudly than Billy; it was like a fraternity jacket to him. An eighteen-year exile was beginning for him, and his sadness, bitterness, melancholy, resentment, and hurt never really faded. His career as a journeyman infielder—playing with six teams, none more than a year, and never to see the World Series again—had begun.&quot; Among the consequences of the trade was the loss of the relationship with Stengel, with whom he rarely spoke in the years that followed.

===Later career (1957–1961)===
Martin switched dugouts after the trade to the A&#x27;s, and in his first game got two hits, including a home run off the Yankees&#x27; Johnny Kucks. Then the Yankees left town, without Martin, who now faced playing for a seventh-place team with little hope of doing better. He hit .360 in his first ten games, but the A&#x27;s lost nine of them. Although Martin hit .257 with Kansas City, an improvement over the .241 he was hitting with the Yankees, the A&#x27;s lost 94 games, finishing 38 games behind the Yankees. At the end of the season, Martin was traded to the Detroit Tigers in a 13-player deal, and he stated angrily, &quot;They just can&#x27;t throw us [players] around from one club to another without us having a say-so.&quot;

Detroit manager Jack Tighe called Martin &quot;the key to our future&quot;; he was expected to electrify the team as he had the Yankees. Without talent on the field and Stengel in the dugout to back him up, Martin was unable to do that, as after a decent start, the Tigers settled down to a losing season, and the players became annoyed at Martin&#x27;s ways. The Tigers had him play shortstop, but he lacked the range and the throwing arm needed to be effective, and made 20 errors for the season. He hit .255 with seven home runs, but the Tigers finished fifth, 15 games behind the Yankees. After the season, Martin and Al Cicotte were traded to Cleveland in exchange for Don Mossi, Ray Narleski and Ossie Álvarez.

With Martin at second base, the Indians finished second in 1959, five games behind the Chicago White Sox and ahead of the third-place Yankees. Despite the relatively good finish, Martin was embittered, contending that if manager Joe Gordon had used him properly, the Indians would have won the pennant. In August, Martin, who did not wear a batting helmet, was hit on the head by a pitch from Tex Clevenger of the Washington Senators, breaking a cheekbone and giving him an unconscious fear of being hit again, diminishing his effectiveness at the plate. He was traded, after the season, to the Cincinnati Reds; manager Fred Hutchinson hoped Martin could instill some fight into his team. Although he could not make the Reds a winner with his diminished skills, he still was a battler on the field, notoriously fighting pitcher Jim Brewer of the Chicago Cubs on August 4, 1960. In the aftermath of his beaning by Clevenger, teams pitched Martin inside, as did Brewer. After one such pitch, Martin, on the next, swung and let his bat go, though it landed far from the pitching mound. When he went out to retrieve it, Brewer approached, Martin swung at him, and sometime during the brawl, a punch broke Brewer&#x27;s orbital bone, though whether it was Martin who did it or Reds pitcher Cal McLish is uncertain. Martin was ejected (his sixth and final ejection as a player), and was suspended for five games and fined by National League president Warren Giles. With Brewer out for the season, the Cubs sued Martin. Litigation dragged on for a decade and the case was eventually settled in 1969 for $10,000 plus $12,000 attorney&#x27;s fees. Martin, who in the press defended his actions as justified given pitchers threw inside to him, asked, &quot;Do they want a check or cash?&quot;

Although Martin played 103 games for the Reds in 1960, batting .246, he had only three home runs and 16 runs batted in, and following the season was sold to the Milwaukee Braves. His old manager with the Oaks, Dressen, led the Braves, but even he could not find a starting position for Martin. He had only six at-bats for the Braves, with no hits, and on June 1, 1961, was traded to the Minnesota Twins for Billy Consolo. Martin, given the starting second baseman position, started well and finished well for the Twins, but in between had a prolonged batting slump. Between the Braves and Twins, he batted .242 for 1961, his lowest full-season average. He reported for spring training in 1962, but was soon approached by manager Sam Mele, a longtime friend, and told that he had been released by the team. No longer able to compete on the field, Martin&#x27;s playing career was over at the age of 33.

Martin accepted an offer by Twins owner Calvin Griffith to be a scout for the team. He also took a job with Grain Belt Brewery in public relations. The combination worked well; Martin proved himself a competent evaluator of talent, while selling the Twins in bars across Minnesota. He urged the Twins to sign pitching prospect Jim Palmer, but Griffith was unwilling to pay the $50,000 signing bonus Palmer requested, and the pitcher went on to a Hall of Fame career with the Baltimore Orioles. With his survival in baseball on the line, Martin kept his nose clean, his drinking moderate, and his fists unclenched.

With manager Mele&#x27;s consent, Griffith made Martin third base coach before the 1965 season, leading to immediate media speculation that when the Twins hit a rough patch, Martin would be appointed as manager. Mele later denied having any feeling that Martin was after his job, and the Twins experienced few losing streaks in 1965, winning the American League pennant. Martin worked with the players to make them more aggressive on the base paths. He recognized the talent of the young Rod Carew, and spent much time working with him to make him a better ballplayer. The Twins had tried to trade shortstop Zoilo Versalles the previous winter; Martin worked on his hitting and base running and Versalles was voted the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. Although the Twins lost the 1965 World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games, Martin was given much of the credit for getting them there.

In 1966, Martin damaged his chances of promotion to the managerial job by getting in a fight with Twins traveling secretary Howard Fox. The Twins and Yankees shared a charter flight, and the players got rowdy. Martin refused Fox&#x27;s request that he intercede with his former teammates, including Mantle and Ford, to get them to quiet down. When the Twins reached their hotel, Fox was slow to give Martin his room key, violating baseball&#x27;s usual etiquette that the manager and coaches got theirs first. When Martin demanded it, Fox threw it at him, and after words were exchanged, Martin hit him in the face. Martin was fined by Griffith, a friend of Fox&#x27;s. When Mele was fired in 1967, his replacement was not Martin, as had been widely speculated, but Cal Ermer.

The Twins started the 1968 season poorly and Martin was called into Griffith&#x27;s office, expecting to be offered Ermer&#x27;s job. Instead, the owner wanted to make Martin the manager of the Denver Bears, the Twins&#x27; top affiliate, at that time with an 8–22 record. Martin was reluctant to accept, but did when his wife Gretchen told him that he needed to prove his ability as a manager before getting a job as one in the major leagues. The Bears started well under .500, but by the end of the season had a winning record. Martin had stressed to the team that they were a single unit, with him as boss. He instituted the aggressive base running he had used in Minnesota, and focused on fundamentals. When the team lost, he told them (and anyone else within earshot) exactly why they had lost; third baseman Graig Nettles, who would play again for Martin as a major leaguer, stated Martin made the players afraid to lose. He defended them before the outside world, confronting umpires—he was ejected from games eight times. The team was 65–50 under Martin, and by season&#x27;s end there was widespread speculation that Martin would be a major league manager in 1969. Despite the two AL expansion teams, the Seattle Pilots and Kansas City Royals, having vacancies, and expressing interest in hiring Martin, he stated that his loyalty was to the Twins, who had had another disappointing season. On October 11, 1968, the Twins gave Martin a one-year contract as manager. Said Griffith, &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m sitting on a keg of dynamite.&quot;

==Managerial career==
===Minnesota Twins (1969)===

As Twins manager, Martin continued the aggressive baseball he had urged on the team as third-base coach. The team lost the first four games of the season, on the road, but came home to the largest Opening Day crowd since the franchise moved to Minnesota. Winning streaks of 5 and 8 games in April established the team in first place in the new American League West and kept the fans coming to Metropolitan Stadium. Martin set a tone of willingness to do anything to win. When Oakland A&#x27;s slugger Reggie Jackson hit home runs in his first two at bats against the Twins, Minnesota pitcher Dick Woodson threw a pitch behind Jackson&#x27;s head. After a second pitch closer to Jackson&#x27;s head than to the plate, the slugger charged the mound, provoking a full-scale brawl, for which Jackson later blamed Martin, who he said had ordered the pitches.

Despite the winning baseball, owner Griffith was less than enamored with Martin&#x27;s conduct. Griffith wanted Martin to meet regularly with him to discuss the team; Martin repeatedly showed up during the time set aside for Griffith&#x27;s daily nap. When pitcher Dave Boswell and outfielder Bob Allison got into a fight outside the Lindell A. C. sports bar in August, Martin joined the battle, repeatedly punching Boswell, who won 20 games that year. Martin claimed that Boswell had come at him first, which Boswell denied. Although it was Boswell who was fined by the team, Griffith considered firing Martin, but decided that the victories on the field justified keeping him. The Twins won the Western Division by 9 games over Oakland, with Boswell winning 8 games down the stretch.

The Twins played the Orioles, who had won 109 games during the regular season (the Twins had won 97) and who were managed by Earl Weaver in the 1969 American League Championship Series (ALCS). Baltimore won the first two games of the best-of-five series at home, with both games going extra innings. At home for Game Three, Martin was expected to start star pitcher Jim Kaat but instead chose Bob Miller, who was knocked out of the box in the second inning, and the Twins were eliminated.

Martin had been given a one-year contract for 1969; he asked for a two-year deal for 1970 and 1971. Griffith was unhappy both that Martin had not pitched Kaat (a friend of his) and that the explanation he had asked Martin for had been &quot;Because I&#x27;m the manager&quot;. Martin&#x27;s decision was defensible, as Kaat had been struggling with injuries, and Miller had won during the pennant race. Other events during the season, such as the fight with Boswell and Martin kicking former US vice president Hubert Humphrey out of the locker room when he tried to visit after a Twins loss also embarrassed the team. Twins executives had also received numerous complaints about Martin drinking heavily during road trips, and were angered when Griffith told &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; columnist Sid Hartman off the record that the Twins were thinking of firing him. Although Martin had led the team to a division title, Fox and other Twins executives felt Martin was more trouble than he was worth and urged his dismissal. Griffith fired him on October 13, 1969. There was outrage among Twins fans, and attendance, which had been boosted by Martin&#x27;s presence and the team&#x27;s success, sank in 1970. The Twins won their second straight division title but again lost the ALCS to Baltimore in three games, this time with Kaat pitching—and losing—Game Three.

===Detroit Tigers (1971–1973)===
Martin spent the 1970 season out of baseball for the first time since 1946, but stayed in the Twin Cities as an interviewer for Minneapolis station KDWB. He received nibbles of interest, including from A&#x27;s owner Charlie Finley, and each later blamed the other for the failure to come to terms. The Detroit Tigers had won the World Series in 1968, but dropped below .500 two years later. Team general manager Jim Campbell felt that the team could win again with the right manager. On October 2, 1970, Campbell fired manager Mayo Smith and gave Martin a two-year deal (for 1971 and 1972) at an annual salary of $65,000. Martin seemed to be an odd fit for the Tigers, given their straitlaced reputation under Campbell, but the general manager felt that Martin was the spark the Tigers needed to return to contention.

Martin announced that the Tigers would win the 1971 American League East title, and that the Orioles were over the hill. He made it clear that he was going to run the team his way, and his clubhouse tirades for poor play even during spring training were reported in the media and concerned Detroit management. He had a well-publicized feud with slugger Willie Horton, whom Martin repeatedly benched and who kept himself out of the lineup with an alleged injury that Martin disputed. There were repeated conflicts with umpires, and with personnel off the field: he accused the organist in Oakland of trying to distract his players, and the scoreboard operators in Baltimore of spying on his team. After a poor April, Martin&#x27;s players won seven in a row to surge to within 4 games of the top-placing Red Sox near the start of June. The results helped establish Martin as one of the best managers in baseball, at least on the field. His generalship could not paper over the flaws in the ball club, and the Tigers finished second, 11 games behind the Orioles. Nevertheless, Martin led the Tigers to a 91–71 record, a 12-game improvement from 1970, proving to many people that his success in Minnesota had not been a fluke.

Martin was rewarded with a new two-year contract, through 1973, with an increase in salary. At spring training, Martin was relaxed and confident, his Tigers a favorite to win the American League East. The season started late, due to a player&#x27;s strike, and the missed games were not made up, which left the teams playing an unequal number of games. Once play started, Martin was his usual self, berating opposing managers and the umpires from the dugout, and being ejected for it in the second game of the season, against Baltimore and Weaver. This was his first ejection as Tigers manager. There was a close AL East pennant race in 1972, when the Tigers and Orioles were joined by the Yankees and Red Sox in contending for the division title. With Detroit winning, those players hostile to Martin remained silent. The season came down to a three-game set between the Tigers and Red Sox, with Boston a half game ahead. The Tigers won the first two, though they lost the meaningless third game, making them the AL East champs by a half game.

In the 1972 American League Championship Series, the Tigers faced the Oakland A&#x27;s. The Tigers lost Game One in extra innings. With the A&#x27;s up 5–0 in Game Two, Tigers pitcher Lerrin LaGrow hit the speedy A&#x27;s shortstop, Bert Campaneris, in the legs. Before a national television audience, Campaneris threw his bat towards the mound, and a brawl ensued. Many believed Martin had ordered Campaneris hit. The Tigers recovered from the 2–0 deficit by winning Games Three and Four at Tiger Stadium, but lost Game Five and the series. Martin was praised for taking the Tigers as far as he did, but his lineup choices for Game Five were questioned—playing catcher Bill Freehan with a broken thumb, while a healthy catcher, Duke Sims, played left field instead of Horton. Both of Martin&#x27;s choices were involved in plays that resulted in A&#x27;s runs, which a better-fielding player might have prevented. Nevertheless, Martin again received a revised two-year contract, through the 1974 season.

The 1973 season was not as successful for Martin and the Tigers. Nevertheless, Martin did have some successes, making John Hiller a successful closer after the pitcher had survived a heart attack, and discovering Ron LeFlore in a Michigan prison; LeFlore would go on to a successful major league career. Martin wanted Campbell to trade some aging veterans to renew the squad, but Campbell refused. Martin briefly quit during spring training when Campbell did not uphold a fine he had imposed on Horton. Factional conflict within the team, muted by the team&#x27;s 1972 success, resurged as the team fell behind in the standings after spending much of the summer in a spirited three-way race with the Orioles and Yankees. Martin angered Campbell, owner John Fetzer, and other Tigers executives by criticizing the front office in the media. Campbell had defended Martin in the past when Fetzer expressed concern about Martin&#x27;s off-field behavior, but became increasingly less willing to do so. In May of 1973, the Tigers were trailing the lowly Milwaukee Brewers in the standings, and when a sportswriter asked Martin if he thought the Brewers were legitimate contenders, Martin hotly replied, &quot;If [the Brewers] can win with that club, then I&#x27;m a Chinese aviator.&quot; This comment irked Brewers fans, and when the Tigers next visited Milwaukee, Brewers fans displayed signs responding to Martin&#x27;s comments, such as &quot;Fly the Friendly Skies of China with Billy Martin&quot;, while Milwaukee County Stadium&#x27;s organist would play the theme to &quot;Chinatown&quot; whenever Martin walked out to the pitching mound, as the crowd booed him. In August, when the Tigers returned to Milwaukee, the Brewers hosted a &quot;Chinese Aviator Night&quot;, with fans dressing up and Martin serving as a judge in a &quot;Chinese Aviator look-alike&quot; contest. Despite being in first place in June, the Brewers ended up with a losing record.

On August 30, frustrated that umpires were not calling Indians pitcher Gaylord Perry for spitballs, Martin ordered his pitchers to do the same, and told the media what he had done after the game. He was suspended by AL president Joe Cronin for breaching league rules. This was the last straw for Campbell, who fired Martin before the suspension ran out.

===Texas Rangers (1973–1975)===
Texas Rangers owner Bob Short was a person Martin knew and trusted from the time in the 1960s when Short was an executive with the Twins. After Martin was dismissed by the Tigers, Short told his manager, Whitey Herzog, that he would fire his own grandmother to have a chance to hire Martin. Short, days later, fired Herzog and hired Martin, provoking Herzog&#x27;s comment, &quot;I&#x27;m fired, I&#x27;m the grandmother.&quot;

Martin faced a serious challenge in trying to rebuild a team that was 47–81 and would lose 105 games that season. No pitcher on the staff won more than nine games that year, and the team had the worst fan attendance in baseball. But Martin felt Short understood him, and he was given a five-year contract that not only made him field manager, but gave him the powers of general manager as well. He would have complete authority over the 25-man roster, and would also be responsible for the farm system. Martin faced a receptive clubhouse; most of the players had grown up watching him as a Yankee on television.
Over the winter of 1973–1974, Martin made several trades, bringing Ferguson Jenkins from the Cubs in exchange for Bill Madlock. Jenkins and Jim Bibby would anchor the pitching staff. He promoted Jim Sundberg and Mike Hargrove to the Rangers from the lower minor leagues. Short sold the team to Brad Corbett just before the 1974 season began; the new owner retained Martin as manager, but did not allow him control of the roster.

The Rangers opened at Arlington Stadium against the two-time defending world champion A&#x27;s: Martin billed the series as the meeting of the top two AL West teams though Las Vegas put the Rangers at 50–1 to win the division. The A&#x27;s won two of three, but all the games were close. After winning a series at Oakland at the end of April marked by aggressive baserunning, the Rangers were in first place. Martin taught the Rangers to improve their play and to beware his rage; outfielder Tom Grieve later stated that he made the team afraid to lose.

The Rangers stayed close to the division lead through May and June, though they dropped to fourth place and eight games back at the All-Star break. The Rangers kept the race close until late September, and finished second, five games back, their record of 84–76 a considerable improvement on 1973. Martin was named AL Manager of the Year, and home attendance more than doubled. Wielding a fungo bat, he led his team onto the field to defend other players during the Ten Cent Beer Night riot.

Given their strong performance in 1974 and Martin&#x27;s reputation for building winners, the Rangers were the favorite in the AL West for 1975 over the three-time defending world champion A&#x27;s. The team underperformed, however, Jenkins going from 25 wins to 17 and other key players not doing as well as in 1974. After a slow start, the Rangers recovered to some extent, but near the end of June found themselves 12 games behind the A&#x27;s. Relations between Martin and the Ranger front office were strained by off-field issues, including Martin&#x27;s drinking and conflict with some of the players, including Sundberg. As he lost control of his team, Martin struck Rangers traveling secretary Burton Hawkins, allegedly for organizing a players&#x27; wives&#x27; club. In July, after a dispute with Corbett over whether to sign free agent catcher Tom Egan, Martin told the media that the owner, who had made a fortune selling plumbing pipes, &quot;knows as much about baseball as I do about pipe&quot;. Corbett began consulting the minority owners to decide whether to fire Martin, and informed the manager of this. One day later, on July 20, after Martin ordered the public address announcer to play &quot;Thank God I&#x27;m a Country Boy&quot; during the seventh inning stretch instead of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; (as Corbett had instructed), he was fired.

===New York Yankees (1975–1978, 1979)===
====1975 and 1976==== 
Martin was not out of work for very long. Two weeks after Texas fired Martin, manager Bill Virdon was fired by the Yankees. The former Yankee second baseman was hired to take his place, marking Martin&#x27;s first time in a Yankee uniform since the 1957 trade. Some players and writers have concluded that he had long campaigned for the Yankee job. What is beyond dispute is that after Martin was dismissed by Texas, New York general manager Gabe Paul, acting on behalf of owner George Steinbrenner, quickly got in touch with Martin. An agreement soon followed, and Martin officially returned to the Bronx on August 1. Well aware of Martin&#x27;s behavioral proclivities, Paul and Steinbrenner believed they could keep Martin under control. They not only wrote good-conduct clauses into Martin&#x27;s contract, but picked the coaching staff themselves.

With little chance of catching the first-place Red Sox, Martin spent the remainder of the 1975 season evaluating his team, cultivating the press and getting ready for 1976. At that time, Paul was operating head of the franchise; Steinbrenner had been suspended from baseball by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn following his conviction for making illegal contributions to Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 re-election campaign, but continued to make decisions (such as Martin&#x27;s hiring) behind the scenes. With Martin at the helm, the Yankees went 30–26 in their final 56 games of the 1975 season; they ended the season in third place, where they had been when he took over.

Martin worked with Paul during the offseason to dispose of players such as Bobby Bonds and Doc Medich, obtaining in return Mickey Rivers, Willie Randolph and others. The 1976 Yankee season was probably his most trouble-free as a major league manager. Martin endeared himself to his players quickly by effectively winning a game in Milwaukee. He pointed out that the first-base umpire had, almost unnoticed, called time out just before an apparent game-winning grand slam by Don Money. The Yankees held on to win that game and quickly moved into first place. Steinbrenner had returned to the helm of the Yankees when Kuhn shortened his suspension during spring training, but did not interfere with Martin&#x27;s managing, content to sit back and watch as the Yankees continued to win.
The Yankees won the AL East by 11 games over Baltimore, securing their first postseason appearance since 1964. In the 1976 American League Championship Series, they played Kansas City. Aggressive baserunning, plus bench jockeying that may have caused Royals third baseman George Brett to make two crucial errors, helped New York win Game One, but Kansas City won two of the next three. Martin&#x27;s choice of Ed Figueroa to pitch the decisive Game Five at Yankee Stadium was controversial as Figueroa had not pitched well late in the season and had lost Game Two, but he was in good form and helped the Yankees to a 6–3 lead in the eighth inning—when Brett tied the game with a three-run home run. Martin did not let the home run faze him, and had a verbal exchange with the next batter, John Mayberry, which helped wake the Yankees up from their stunned disbelief at Brett&#x27;s home run. Yankee first baseman Chris Chambliss drove the first pitch of the bottom of the ninth over the right field wall, garnering the Yankees their first pennant since 1964, and Martin his first as a manager. The Yankees faced the defending world champion Reds in the 1976 World Series, and lost in four straight games. Martin was ejected from Game Four, at Yankee Stadium, after rolling a baseball towards umpire Bruce Froemming, the only Yankee to ever be kicked out of a World Series game.

====1977 championship season====
In the offseason, Steinbrenner sought to sign free agent outfielder Reggie Jackson, convinced that he would add punch to the middle of the Yankee lineup. Steinbrenner wooed the slugger, taking him to lunch at the 21 Club and walking with him on Manhattan&#x27;s sidewalks as fans called out to Jackson, urging him to become a Yankee. Though New York did not make the highest offer, Jackson signed with the team. Sources record Martin&#x27;s views on Jackson&#x27;s signing differently: Pennington stated that Martin was not opposed and told Steinbrenner he could use a right fielder, whereas Golenbock deemed Martin &quot;&quot;certainly&quot; didn&#x27;t want Reggie&quot;, feeling that Jackson was too much of a prima donna, who might rebel against the manager&#x27;s authority, and be &quot;tougher to handle than a bull at a rodeo&quot;. Falkner wrote that while Martin did not see Jackson as filling the team&#x27;s needs, he was not opposed. Both Martin and Paul stated that once Bobby Grich was signed by the California Angels, Martin supported signing Jackson. Nevertheless, Martin was embittered by Steinbrenner taking Jackson to famous restaurants when he had not invited Martin to lunch, even though the manager was spending the offseason in nearby New Jersey.

When the Yankees lost six of the first eight games of the 1977 season, Steinbrenner called separate meetings with the players, the manager and the press, and told Martin that he had better get the team to turn things around or he could expect to be fired. Steinbrenner told the press what he had told Martin. In May, Jackson alienated most of his teammates by saying in an interview that he, rather than the respected team captain, Thurman Munson, was &quot;the straw that stirs the drink&quot; on the team. Martin was drinking heavily, and had briefly quit in spring training following an argument with Steinbrenner, who was, according to Falkner, &quot;the owner whose idea of &#x27;hands-on&#x27; was a stranglehold&quot;.
Jackson&#x27;s ties to Steinbrenner, who had given him his contract, made Martin powerless to discipline the slugger. Golenbock noted,

The question of whether the strife between Martin and Jackson involved a racial element has divided Yankee players and those who have written about the 1977 team. In his 2013 autobiography, Jackson stated that there was, and that Martin and some white Yankees would tell racist jokes. Among black Yankees who were there when Martin was, Elliott Maddox agreed with Jackson but others, such as Chambliss, denied there was racism.

Tensions between Martin and Jackson exploded on national television on June 18 at Fenway Park, the NBC Saturday afternoon Game of the Week, with the Yankees a half game behind the Red Sox. Martin pulled Jackson off the field mid-inning (replacing him with Paul Blair) for failing to hustle on a shallow outfield fly ball by Jim Rice, allowing Rice to reach second base. The enraged Martin had to be restrained by coaches Elston Howard and Yogi Berra from getting into a fight with Jackson in the dugout, scenes shown across the nation by NBC. Steinbrenner was convinced that he should fire Martin, but negotiations brokered by backup catcher Fran Healy secured a truce. Nevertheless, the rumors that Martin would be fired, some originated by Steinbrenner, would continue season-long. All of this went on in the full glare of New York&#x27;s newspapers and, with the public firmly on Martin&#x27;s side, Steinbrenner stayed his hand. According to Appel in his history of the Yankees, &quot;the team was winning, the turnstiles were clicking, and the Yanks were dominating the sports pages&quot;.

By August 7, there was renewed conflict on the team, including between Martin and Jackson, and the Yankees had fallen five games behind the Red Sox. Martin had pledged to bat Jackson cleanup, as he wanted, but had rarely done so. Healy and Munson interceded with Martin, and when Martin batted Jackson fourth on August 10, both Jackson and the team responded by going on hot streaks. Despite a season of turmoil, the Yankees won 40 of their last 50 games to take the division by 2 games over both Boston and Baltimore. Appel noted, &quot;The &#x27;77 Yanks won 100 games and the division title, but Billy Martin looked much more like a man who had taken each of the 62 defeats as a sock in the face. Hidden behind dark glasses, losing weight, drinking excessively, he had been through hell and back.&quot;

The Yankees played the Royals again in the 1977 American League Championship Series, the teams split the first two games, at Yankee Stadium, and the Royals won Game Three in Kansas City. Needing to win two straight on the road to win the pennant, the Yankees won Game Four, and Martin benched Jackson from the starting lineup in Game Five, feeling that he did not hit Royals pitcher Paul Splittorff well. In the eighth inning, with the Yankees losing 3–1, Martin put Jackson in as a pinch hitter and Jackson singled off reliever Doug Bird to drive in a run. The Yankees scored three runs in the ninth to win their second straight pennant, 5–3.

The 1977 World Series was against the Los Angeles Dodgers. In Game One in New York, the Yankees won 4–3 in 12 innings on a single by Blair, who had replaced Jackson late in the game for defensive reasons. The Yankees lost Game Two, and on the off day before Game Three at Dodger Stadium, there was more conflict in the press between Martin and Jackson. A conference in Gabe Paul&#x27;s hotel room smoothed matters over, and the Yankees won Games Three and Four, but lost Game Five to send the series back to New York. Prior to Game Six, the Yankees announced that Martin was being given a bonus and an extended contract, relieving some of the intense pressure on him—the media had reported that he would be fired if the Yankees lost the World Series. Jackson, who had been mockingly dubbed Mr. October by Munson during the conflict before Game Three, made the name his own by hitting three home runs off three Dodger pitchers on consecutive pitches, and the Yankees won 8–4, before a jubilant crowd which invaded the field after the final pitch. Jackson and Martin were interviewed for television with arms around each other. Golenbeck noted that Martin &quot;had fought the other teams in the league, fought his star player, and fought his owner, who respected no man&quot;. According to Appel, &quot;it would be the only world championship of Martin&#x27;s managing career, and it was a painful one&quot;.

====1978 and first departure====
The events of 1977 placed Martin among the most prominent New York celebrities, a status he would keep until his death, as headline writers would refer to &quot;Billy&quot; without fear of readers misunderstanding who was meant. He was seen in the city&#x27;s nightlife, often with different young women, at a time when his second marriage was disintegrating after years of turmoil. He also garnered numerous endorsement deals, but cashed the checks rather than pay taxes on them. As a result, he would be under constant scrutiny from the Internal Revenue Service for the last decade of his life. Paul left to run the Indians after the 1977 season and was replaced by Al Rosen. Paul&#x27;s departure removed one of the buffers between Martin and Steinbrenner; Martin blamed the owner for constant interference during the season.

There was no relief from conflict when the 1978 season began, with Mickey Rivers benched after appearing to loaf after a fly ball, and an alcohol-fueled altercation between team members on an airplane that helped put an end to the Yankees flying on commercial airlines in favor of charter flights. Steinbrenner blamed Martin for failure to keep discipline. Martin did not believe in trying to regulate the players&#x27; conduct off the field, something he had learned from Casey Stengel. Injuries to several players, including much of the starting staff, meant the Yankees did not commence the season as well as the previous year. By mid-June, the Yankees were seven games behind the Red Sox, and Steinbrenner was impatient. Martin was under extreme stress for much of the summer amid repeated rumors that he would be fired.

By July 17, the Yankees were 13 games behind Boston. That day, against the Royals, Jackson came to the plate in the bottom of the tenth inning with Munson on base and Martin put the bunt sign on. After Jackson fouled the first pitch off, the sign was taken off, with Jackson instructed to swing away. Jackson tried to bunt the next two pitches, and popped out. A furious Martin wanted Jackson suspended for the remainder of the season after the game, but agreed to suspend Jackson for five games after consulting with upper management. Matters came to a head when Jackson returned. Jackson told reporters that he did not know why Martin had suspended him. Martin also learned, from White Sox owner Bill Veeck, that Steinbrenner had been trying to arrange a trade of managers with the White Sox while publicly insisting that Martin would finish out the 1978 season. The plan called for White Sox manager Bob Lemon to go to the Yankees, with Martin succeeding Lemon in Chicago. However, the deal was not made and Lemon was subsequently fired by Veeck. Martin told reporters of Jackson and Steinbrenner (referring to the latter&#x27;s illegal contributions to Nixon), &quot;The two of them deserve each other. One&#x27;s a born liar; the other&#x27;s convicted.&quot;

The next day, July 24, 1978, Martin announced he was stepping aside for health reasons at a tearful press conference. He did so on the advice of his longtime legal adviser, Louisiana judge Eddie Sapir, who concluded earlier in the day that the Yankees would almost certainly fire him for cause. By resigning for reasons of health, Martin obligated Steinbrenner to honor his contract. Steinbrenner replaced Martin with Lemon. There was considerable anger among Yankee fans at Martin&#x27;s forced departure, and towards Steinbrenner; some holders of season tickets burned them outside Yankee Stadium.

===Billy II: Second stint with the Yankees (1979)===
Steinbrenner almost immediately had second thoughts about Martin&#x27;s departure, and negotiations for his return, including meetings between the two, began within two days of the resignation. At first, the plan was for Martin to return in 1979, working elsewhere in the organization until then, but Rosen felt Lemon, who replaced Martin, needed to be given a full year. The talks were successfully kept quiet, and at Old-Timers&#x27; Day at Yankee Stadium, July 29, 1978, Martin was introduced as the Yankee manager for 1980 and after by public address announcer Bob Sheppard, meeting an ovation from the crowd reputed to be second only to that given Lou Gehrig on his retirement in 1939. However, Golenblock believed it might have been greater, saying, &quot;The fans &quot;liked&quot; Gehrig. They &quot;loved&quot; Billy.&quot;
The re-hiring was only a verbal commitment, and was to some extent dependent on Martin staying out of trouble, which he did not do. During the offseason, Martin engaged in fisticuffs with &quot;Reno Gazette&quot; reporter Ray Hagar while visiting the city as a guest of the Reno Bighorns basketball team. Steinbrenner insisted that Martin could return to the Yankees only if there was neither conviction nor out-of-court settlement, and this occurred, though money likely changed hands behind the scenes. In the interim, the Yankees, under Lemon, had made a dramatic comeback to win the division, pennant and their second consecutive World Series over the Dodgers.

In 1979, the Yankees got off to a slow start under Lemon. Injuries to Jackson and Gossage, and key players proving less effective than the year before had the Yankees reeling. Steinbrenner fired Lemon on June 18 and brought back Martin. The Yankees failed to improve, and Munson&#x27;s death in a private plane crash on August 2 devastated the team. The Yankees were 34–30 when Martin took over and finished 89–71, in fourth place. After the season, Martin got into a fight with marshmallow salesman Joseph Cooper at a hotel in Minneapolis. Cooper said that Martin should not have won his American League Manager of the Year award, which he believed should have gone to Dick Williams or Earl Weaver. Martin, in his autobiography, replied by mocking Cooper&#x27;s profession and in the process angered him to the point where Cooper challenged Martin to a fight. Martin responded by wagering $500 that he could beat Cooper and proceeded to do so. Facing pressure from the commissioner&#x27;s office to do something about Martin&#x27;s off-field conduct, Steinbrenner fired Martin five days later.

===Oakland Athletics (1980–1982)===
Martin did not get any immediate interest after being dismissed by the Yankees, but in February 1980, Oakland owner Charlie Finley sought to hire him. The A&#x27;s had fallen far from their championship heyday of the early 1970s as Finley had refused to go along with the escalating salaries of free agency. In 1979, the team was , the second-worst record in baseball, and drew less than 4,000 per home game. In hopes of reviving the franchise, Finley turned to Martin. While the job brought Martin back to his East Bay roots, he was well aware that it might be his last chance, both because of the conflict that surrounded him and his lack of success with the 1979 Yankees.

One of the players under contract to the A&#x27;s was Glenn Burke, who in 1982 would become the first MLB former player to reveal he was gay. Claudell Washington later stated that Martin introduced Burke, &quot;Oh, by the way, this is Glenn Burke and he&#x27;s a f—-t.&#x27;&quot; Burke suffered a knee injury during 1980 spring training; Burke&#x27;s roommate Mike Norris stated that Martin used this as cover to send him to the minor leagues, not wanting him on the team. According to Norris, Martin cut Derek Bryant because the manager mistook him for Burke, stating &quot;get that m---------ing homosexual out of there&quot;; neither Burke nor Bryant ever played in MLB again.

The 1980 A&#x27;s had few standouts, and many of the young players were in awe of Martin: some who later became stars credited Martin with developing them. He had Rickey Henderson steal only on signs until Henderson learned how to read pitchers in their windup; then Martin turned Henderson loose. According to Pennington, &quot;under Billy&#x27;s tutelage, Henderson became the best leadoff hitter and base stealer in the history of Major League Baseball.&quot; Many in baseball were surprised to find the A&#x27;s only 2½ games behind the heavily favored Kansas City Royals at the end of May. The A&#x27;s finished second in the AL West with an 83–79 record. Although they were 14 games behind the Royals, the 29-game improvement was enough to garner Martin a Manager of the Year award. Attendance at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum rose by over 500,000, a 175% increase, enabling Finley to sell the team at a better price.

The new owners, the Haas family, owners of Levi Strauss, were inexperienced in baseball. They gave Martin the additional title of player development director, with complete authority over the baseball side of the operation–effectively making him his own general manager. Martin brought his aggressive style of play, which was dubbed &quot;Billyball&quot; by a sportswriter early in the 1981 season. The name stuck; the A&#x27;s later trademarked it. The A&#x27;s were at in early May, Martin appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and the five-man rotation was on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Mike Norris, Rick Langford, Matt Keough, Steve McCatty, and Brian Kingman had a cumulative ERA of 1.42. In 1980 the pitching staff threw 94 complete games–far and away the most in the American League–in part because Martin did not trust his untested bullpen. He was applauded by baseball fans across the country even when he was kicked out of a game and suspended by the league for a week for kicking dirt on the umpire. The Oakland momentum was finally checked by the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, which shut down baseball for nearly two months midseason. The season was split into two halves, the division leaders at the time of the strike (in the AL West, the A&#x27;s) to play the second-half winners (the Royals) in a special division series. The A&#x27;s won in three straight games to face the Yankees in the League Championship Series. The opportunity to beat the Yankees meant much to Martin, and Steinbrenner, seeing the Oakland success, was privately stating that he might have been too quick to fire Martin after the marshmallow salesman incident. But the veteran New York lineup and pitching staff was able to dominate the A&#x27;s as the Yankees swept the series in three games.

With the best combined record in the American League and second-best combined record in all of baseball in 1981, expectations were high for the A&#x27;s in 1982. However, the season did not go well for the A&#x27;s, who never got much over .500. They had a record after a win on May 10, then cooled down. By the All-Star break in mid-July, they were , twelve games back in sixth place, well out of the pennant race. None of the starting pitchers would match their 1981 form, and none ever would, leading to accusations from baseball historians and statisticians that Martin abbreviated their careers by overusing them in 1981. In 2006, Rob Neyer estimated that the four top starters from the 1981 team threw anywhere from 120 to 140 pitches per complete game—a heavy workload for pitchers as young as the A&#x27;s rotation had been in 1981. The A&#x27;s finished at , fifth in the AL West, easily the worst full-season record of Martin&#x27;s managerial career.

On October 20, 1982, three weeks after the season ended, the A&#x27;s fired him with three years remaining on his contract. Although the Haases did not hold Martin responsible for the on-field debacle, they had grown increasingly concerned about his off-field behavior and feared he was growing unstable. Incidents included considerable drinking and traveling with a mistress while on the road. The last straw came when Martin trashed his own office after team officials refused him a loan to pay a tax debt. There has been speculation that Martin had been assured by Steinbrenner that he would be Yankee manager in 1983 if he could get himself fired by Oakland, and he may have been acting to that end.

===Remaining stints with the Yankees (1983, 1985, 1988)===

The Yankees had finished fifth in 1982, their first losing record in the Steinbrenner era, doing so under three managers—Lemon, Gene Michael and Clyde King—all fired by Steinbrenner.

On January 11, 1983, the Yankees announced that Martin had been hired as manager under a long-term contract. He would remain on the Yankees&#x27; payroll for the rest of his life. Jackson had departed for the California Angels, but other Yankees from Martin&#x27;s earlier tenures remained, such as Randolph and Ron Guidry, and the team had added strong players like Dave Winfield and Don Baylor. Steinbrenner had pledged non-interference but, as the team struggled early in the season, resumed his second-guessing of Martin, both directly and by leak to the media. As relations between owner and manager deteriorated, Martin had conflicts with reporters and a brawl with a patron in an Anaheim bar.

During the 1983 season, Martin was involved in one of the most controversial regular season games, known as the Pine Tar Incident, when Martin challenged a home run by George Brett on the grounds that the amount of pine tar on the bat broke the rules. Brett was ruled out and the home run disallowed; as this occurred with two out in the top of the ninth, it ended the game with the Yankees leading 4–3. American League President Lee MacPhail ruled in favor of the Royals&#x27; protest. The game was resumed some weeks later with Kansas City leading 5–4 and two out in the top half of the ninth. At the start of the resumed game, Martin tried to protest on the grounds that Brett had missed a base. The umpires had anticipated this, and had obtained an affidavit from the crew who had worked the original game saying that Brett had indeed touched all the bases. The Yankees did not play as well during and after the distraction of the Pine Tar Game, and fell further behind the division-leading Orioles. The Yankees finished second, 91–71, seven games behind the Orioles. On December 16, Steinbrenner removed Martin as manager, giving him a scouting assignment, and replacing him with Berra.

The Yankees finished third under Berra, 17 games behind the Tigers. When, at the start of the 1985 season, Steinbrenner pledged that Berra would remain manager for the whole season, there was immediate speculation that Martin would return at the earliest opportunity. As it turned out, Steinbrenner fired Berra after 16 games and replaced him with Martin. Stated Martin, &quot;George and I have the greatest relationship I&#x27;ve ever had with him.&quot; With an MVP season from Don Mattingly and a strong effort from Rickey Henderson, who had been acquired by the Yankees, the team played well throughout the summer, coming to within a game and a half of the division-leading Toronto Blue Jays on September 12. They then lost eight in a row, and as the Yankees fell out of the race, according to Pennington, &quot;Martin seemed to melt down with it.&quot; On September 22, 1985, while at a hotel bar in Baltimore, Martin fought one of his pitchers, Ed Whitson, who was larger, heavier and trained in martial arts. Martin suffered a broken arm. The Yankees recovered to win 97 games, but finished two games back of the Blue Jays, eliminated on the second to last day of the season. On October 27, 1985, Martin was fired again as Yankee manager, replaced by longtime Yankee player Lou Piniella. Nevertheless, Steinbrenner, believing that Martin could again bring a championship to the Yankees and, fearing he might do so elsewhere, increased Martin&#x27;s salary; the four-time manager of the Yankees turned down lucrative offers from the White Sox and Indians.

Steinbrenner kept Martin as a close advisor in 1986; he was formally part of the broadcasting staff under his personal services contract, which the owner extended so that Martin was now earning over $300,000 per year, a sum he was unlikely to match as manager elsewhere. Steinbrenner had considerable affection for Martin and wanted him to be without financial worries. Martin had long wanted to see his number 1 retired by the Yankees. Seeking to keep his past and future manager happy, Steinbrenner agreed, and Billy Martin Day took place at Yankee Stadium on August 10, 1986. At the ceremony, during which the number was retired and Martin given a plaque in Monument Park, he stated, &quot;I may not have been the greatest Yankee to ever put on the uniform but I was the proudest.&quot;

New York finished second behind the Red Sox in 1986, but were never really in contention, and finished fourth in 1987. After the season, Piniella was asked to accept a promotion to general manager so that Steinbrenner could make Martin manager for a fifth time in 1988. Despite minimal expectations, Martin got the 1988 Yankees off to a good start. However, on the night of May 7, Martin was involved in a brawl at a Dallas-area nightclub in which he came out worst. Already foreseeing the end, and with marital troubles, on May 30, Martin was kicked out of a game against the A&#x27;s, flinging dirt on umpire Dale Scott. Martin was suspended for three games and fined by the league. However, the umpires&#x27; union thought this was too lenient. The American League crew chiefs announced that Martin would be ejected as soon as he left the Yankee dugout. A month later, Steinbrenner fired Martin, citing &quot;a combination of factors&quot; in explaining his decision; Pennington suggested that while many Yankee fans took to talk radio in anger at Martin&#x27;s firing, there was less outrage than there had been in the 1970s, and greater concern for Martin as a person. He became a special adviser to Steinbrenner, though in practice he had no duties and rarely visited New York.

Piniella returned as manager, but was fired at the end of the 1988 season after the Yankees played sub-.500 ball during his second stint. Steinbrenner replaced him with Dallas Green. The Yankees saw little success under Green in 1989, and he was fired in August, replaced by Bucky Dent. Steinbrenner was unconvinced that Dent could lead the Yankees back to a championship, and planned to keep Martin close at hand as manager-in-waiting should Dent falter in 1990. He apparently told Martin of this during a November meeting at Yankee Stadium. Soon afterward, Martin got in touch with several of his former coaches and told them to be ready to join him for a sixth managerial tenure with the Yankees.

==Death==

Martin was still a special consultant to Steinbrenner when he was killed in a low speed single-vehicle accident on Christmas Day 1989. His vehicle ran into a drainage culvert near the entrance of the driveway to his farm in Port Crane, north of Binghamton, New York. He was pronounced dead at a hospital in Johnson City, New York.

Also present in the vehicle that night was Martin&#x27;s friend Bill Reedy, who had been drinking with Martin at a local bar, and who was seriously injured in the accident. Reedy at first stated that he had driven the vehicle with Martin the passenger but after learning that Martin had died, changed his story, saying that he had lied to protect Martin against the consequences of a drunk driving conviction. He was convicted in a jury trial of driving with a blood alcohol level of .10, was fined, and his license suspended. A subsequent civil trial also found he was the driver. Golenbock, who wrote his book after the criminal trial but before the civil, was convinced that Martin was the driver. In this, he joined Martin&#x27;s children and some of his close friends, like Mickey Mantle, who believed Martin would not have allowed another to drive him that night. Martin&#x27;s biographers point to inadequacies in the police investigation. Pennington noted that those who believe Martin was the driver are the minority; Reedy was seen holding the car keys as the two left the bar, and the positions of the men when rescuers arrived pointed to Reedy being the driver. No autopsy was performed, allegedly due to opposition by Martin&#x27;s widow and by Steinbrenner; New York City Medical Examiner Michael Baden was allowed to examine the body.

Martin was eulogized by Cardinal John O&#x27;Connor at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, New York, before his interment at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York. His grave is located about from Babe Ruth&#x27;s, in Section 25. The following epitaph, spoken by Martin at his number retiring ceremony at Yankee Stadium in 1986, appears on the headstone: &quot;I may not have been the greatest Yankee to put on the uniform, but I was the proudest.&quot; Steinbrenner and former United States President Richard Nixon, along with many New York Yankee greats, attended Martin&#x27;s funeral service.

==Managerial record==
==Managerial techniques==

Bill James noted that &quot;Billy Martin, of course, improved every team he ever managed in his first year in control, usually by huge margins. Within a year or two, all of those teams were ready to get rid of him.&quot; According to Chris Jaffe in his book evaluating baseball managers, &quot;Martin was the perfect manager to hire if you wanted an immediate improvement and the worst manager for a team seeking sustained success.&quot; Part of this, Jaffe argued, was because Martin &quot;would do whatever it took to win that day, and not worry about any negative side effects in the future&quot;, even if it meant a shortened career for his players. The subsequent ineffectiveness of the young starting pitchers on the 1981 A&#x27;s is cited by Jaffe as one example of this; others include pitcher Catfish Hunter, who completed every game he started but one during Martin&#x27;s partial season with the 1975 Yankees, and who was never the same pitcher after that year, and Ferguson Jenkins with Texas in 1974, who pitched 29 complete games for the Rangers, and who declined thereafter. A similar attitude permeated his use of relief pitchers: &quot;he wanted who he wanted when he wanted without concern towards keeping their arms well rested.&quot;

In 1988, the Elias Sports Bureau proclaimed Martin the best manager in major league history, based on modeling that found that Martin&#x27;s teams won 7.45 more games per year than they should have as predicted by statistics, higher than any other manager. He was the first manager to have led four different teams to the postseason, a feat that would not be matched until 2012 nor bettered until 2020, by which time the postseason had expanded greatly from Martin&#x27;s day. Martin sought to catch the other team by surprise, using such techniques as stealing home—once having two Twins steal home on different pitches of the same at bat, with the slugger Harmon Killebrew at the plate. Stealing home is a tactic unlikely to succeed, yet Martin made it work, and his teams got better. Jaffe noted that with Minnesota in 1969, Martin ended such risky tactics well before the end of the season, by which time he had set the tone he wanted both with his team, and with opponents. According to Jimmy Keenan and Frank Russo in their biography of Martin for the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), &quot;He played the game hard and made no excuses for the way he handled himself on or off the field. Many people, including his off-and-on boss, George Steinbrenner, considered Martin a baseball genius for the intuitive way he managed his teams.&quot;

Hall of Fame Manager Tony La Russa stated of him, &quot;without reservation I would call Billy the most brilliant field manager I ever saw. He was unmatched. None of us felt up to him.&quot; Stengel stated in an interview a month before his death in 1975, &quot;He&#x27;s a good manager. He might be a little selfish about some things he does and he may think he knows more about baseball than anybody else and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if he was right.&quot; When asked why he had admired Martin as a player, Stengel replied, &quot;If liking a kid who never let you down in the clutch is favoritism, then I plead guilty.&quot; James deemed Martin the third-most successful manager of the 1970s, behind Sparky Anderson and Earl Weaver, and the most controversial. Pennington also noted that those who fired Martin for his off-field behavior went out of their way to praise what he had done on the field. Campbell, for instance, said that &quot;from foul line to foul line, Billy did a good job,&quot; while the A&#x27;s told Sapir that &quot;we won&#x27;t find a better manager&quot; than Martin.

Falkner noted that what Martin wanted was &quot;to win, period&quot;, and quoted him as saying, &quot;I would play Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo on my team if I thought it would help me win.&quot; Willie Randolph stated, &quot;you always knew if you got to the eighth or ninth inning and you were tied or one run down, Billy would find a way to win&quot;. Falkner noted, &quot;he wanted to win, that was all. And for the time he was in the game, everyone knew it. And he won.&quot; Jaffe suggested that the person Martin was most akin to was not any other baseball manager, but Hernando Cortez, the conquistador who burned his own ships after arriving in Mexico, forcing his soldiers to conquer or die. &quot;That was Billyball, sixteenth century style.&quot;

Pennington believed that Martin was very much a person of his times: &quot;In the age of several round-the-clock ESPN channels, the ceaseless chatter of sports talk radio, and omnipresent smartphone cameras, Billy could not exist. At least not as an employed baseball manager.&quot; Pennington suggested, though, that had Martin been born 20 years later, his friends would have confronted him about his drinking problem; in Martin&#x27;s day, such things were more often ignored. Pennington believes Martin&#x27;s reputation for brawling and drinking has kept him out of the Hall of Fame; even if other managers who are in the Hall, such as Weaver and Leo Durocher, got into fights and drank sometimes to excess, they did not acquire the same reputation for those things as did Martin. Golenbock suggested that Martin&#x27;s alcoholism, together with his pride in being a Yankee kept him in a relationship with Steinbrenner that kept him willing to try to manage the team again and again, despite the difficult relationship with the owner.

==Personal life and public image==
Martin was married four times and had two children, a daughter named Kelly Ann and a son named Billy Joe. His first marriage was to Lois Berndt, who was the mother of Kelly Ann. She divorced him in 1955, after he had contested the action for more than a year on the grounds that he was Catholic. He married Gretchen Winkler in 1961. Billy Joe was born of that marriage; his parents divorced in 1979. He was married a third time, to Heather Ervolino, while he was managing in Oakland. He married his mistress, freelance photographer Jillian Guiver, in January 1988.

Heather Ervolio sued Martin in 1986 for $500,000, aimed at halting her eviction from the luxury home they had shared for five years. She alleged that Martin began seeing her when she was 16 and was still married to his second wife, Gretchen Winkler, and then abruptly abandoned her. She alleged this was a pattern of behavior for Martin, that he had abandoned his previous wife Jill at a bar to marry Heather in 1982.
After his death the feud between Martin&#x27;s children and his widow Jill became a prominent story in the New York newspapers. Billy&#x27;s children and other relatives alleged that Jill was hiding their inheritance and in protest several family members refused to attend his funeral.

Martin and Steinbrenner appeared together in the series of &quot;Tastes Great!...Less Filling!&quot; commercials for Miller Lite beer. In one, filmed in 1978, during the final days of Martin&#x27;s first stint with the Yankees, Steinbrenner fires Martin, who says, &quot;Oh, not again&quot;. Within weeks, Martin was forced to resign over the &quot;one&#x27;s a born liar, and the other&#x27;s convicted&quot; statement. The commercial aired again in June 1979, following Martin&#x27;s return to manage the Yankees a second time, but with Steinbrenner saying &quot;You&#x27;re hired.&quot;

In 1978, Martin played himself in the CBS TV movie &quot;One in a Million: The Ron LeFlore Story&quot;. Martin was a guest ring announcer at the inaugural WrestleMania in March 1985. On May 24, 1986, on the season finale of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, co-host Martin was &quot;fired&quot; by executive producer Lorne Michaels for being &quot;drunk&quot; in a skit, slurring his lines. In retaliation, Martin set the dressing room on fire, a staged scene set as a cliffhanger for the following season.

In 1978, Martin and sports agent Doug Newton opened Billy Martin&#x27;s, a western wear boutique in New York City. Newton bought out Martin in 1982; the store remained open until 2010.

==Appraisal==
Pennington, writing over 20 years after Martin&#x27;s death, explained, &quot;Billy was beloved because he represented a traditional American dream: freedom. He lived independent from rules. He bucked the system ... He told his boss to shove it. Often.&quot; The biographer complained that Martin, in the era of video clips and ESPN, has been reduced to a caricature: the man who kicked dirt on umpires, battled with Reggie Jackson in a dugout and who was forever being hired and fired, something that ignores a record of achievement both as player and manager. Appel noted, &quot;There was never a more prideful Yankee. Or a more complicated one.&quot;

James wrote, &quot;I suppose one could say the same about Billy Martin or about Richard Nixon ... had he not been so insecure, he could have resisted the self-destructive excesses which gradually destroyed him&quot;. Pennington, who covered the Yankees as a newspaper reporter from 1985 to 1989, described Martin as &quot;without question one of the most magnetic, entertaining, sensitive, humane, brilliant, generous, insecure, paranoid, dangerous, irrational, and unhinged people I had ever met&quot;. Golenbock, who co-wrote Martin&#x27;s autobiography, said of him, &quot;but because Billy was an alcoholic who drank and fought publicly, and because the man for whom he worked destroyed his reputation through constant public denigrations and firings, he may never join the hallowed hall where he should rightfully be placed next to his mentor, Casey Stengel.&quot;

Mike Lupica of the &quot;Daily News&quot; wrote that &quot;Yankee fans never seemed to see him drunk, or nasty, or as Steinbrenner&#x27;s toady, the way others did. They looked the other way, again and again and again. They always saw him as Billy the Kid.&quot; Pennington noted that the new owners of Martin&#x27;s farm sometimes find fans wanting to see where he died, or makeshift memorials by the roadside where the accident occurred. Martin&#x27;s grave has remained well-visited by Yankee fans, sometimes before driving to the Bronx to take in a home game. Andrew Nagle, who oversaw the cemetery, stated &quot;people want to leave some acknowledgement of what he meant to them ... we don&#x27;t let go of the people that touched us ... It&#x27;s the same with Billy Martin. People won&#x27;t let him go. They won&#x27;t forget him.&quot;

<text>George Kuchar (August 31, 1942 – September 6, 2011) was an American underground film director and video artist, known for his &quot;low-fi&quot; aesthetic.

==Early life and career==
Kuchar trained as a commercial artist at the School of Industrial Art, now known as the High School of Art and Design, a vocational school in New York City. He graduated in 1960 and drew weather maps for a local news show. During this period, he and his twin brother Mike Kuchar were making 8mm movies, which were showcased in the then-burgeoning underground film scene alongside films by Andy Warhol, Kenneth Anger, and Stan Brakhage. Ken Jacobs brought attention of their work to Jonas Mekas, who championed their work in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; and elsewhere.

After being laid off from a commercial art job in New York City, Kuchar was offered a teaching job in the film department of the San Francisco Art Institute, where he taught from 1971 until early 2011.

In San Francisco, Kuchar became involved with underground comics via his neighbors Art Spiegelman and Bill Griffith. They both wound up in his movies and George wound up in their publications.

==Films==
George Kuchar directed over 200 films and videos (including over 15 with his twin brother Mike), many of them short films by students in his courses at the San Francisco Art Institute. In the Critics&#x27; Poll of the 100 best films of the 20th century, appearing originally in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; (4 January 2000), &quot;Hold Me While I&#x27;m Naked&quot; was ranked 52nd.

&quot;I, An Actress&quot;, a 1977 film featuring a screen test of student actress Barbera Lapsley, was selected by the National Film Registry in 2011.

His film work influenced the No Wave Cinema movement during the late 70s-early 80s.

==Video diaries==
After leaving New York City for San Francisco, Kuchar prolifically produced video diaries, the true quantity of which remains unknown. Varying in duration from five to ninety minutes, Kuchar&#x27;s video diaries inflect his everyday life with familiar themes of Kuchar&#x27;s oeuvre such as appetite, voluptuousness, the hilarity of bathos, campy appropriation, flatulence, the weather, urination, friendship, love, and the artificiality of cinema itself. The most well known of Kuchar&#x27;s video diaries are his &quot;Weather Diary Series&quot; that chronicle Kuchar&#x27;s annual pilgrimages to El Reno, Oklahoma, to observe tornadoes. In response to changes in media technology, Kuchar&#x27;s video diaries increasingly applied the tactics of camp appropriation to the stuff of the digital age. Kuchar&#x27;s later video diaries made use of consumer grade digital effects to generate something like postmodern psychedelia. His entire output of video work is archived at the Video Data Bank. Electronic Arts Intermix has a selection of titles.

Kuchar&#x27;s video work has clearly influenced the contemporary queer performance/video artists Ryan Trecartin and Felix Bernstein.

==Painting==
Kuchar&#x27;s paintings often reflect the same themes as his film and video works while also sharing their fauvist-like color scheme. According to Eileen Myles, Kuchar was used to working in boxes and found that painting and video didn&#x27;t feel all that different. Kuchar&#x27;s paintings were exhibited intermittently throughout his career, most recently at the Casey Kaplan Gallery in Manhattan and in 2012 at MoMA PS1 as a part of Kuchar&#x27;s posthumous retrospective: Pagan Rhapsodies.

&quot;Portrait George and Mike Kuchar&quot; (1977) by Rosa von Praunheim.

&quot;It Came from Kuchar&quot;, a documentary film of the life of George and Mike Kuchar by Jennifer Kroot, premiered at the South by Southwest film festival on 14 March 2009.

In 1997, the Kuchar brothers collaborated on a book &quot;Reflections from a Cinematic Cesspool&quot;, a memoir discussing four decades of filmmaking with an introduction by director John Waters.

==Death==
George Kuchar died on 6 September 2011 in San Francisco, just past his 69th birthday on August 31, of complications related to prostate cancer. He was remembered by The New York Times as &quot;a filmmaker whose campy yet ardent low-budget movies inspired underground directors like John Waters and David Lynch in the 1960s, and helped kindle the do-it-yourself moviemaking aesthetic now ubiquitous on YouTube.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, a transcendental extension formula_1 is a field extension such that there exists an element in the field formula_2 that is transcendental over the field formula_3; that is, an element that is not a root of any univariate polynomial with coefficients in formula_3. In other words, a transcendental extension is a field extension that is not algebraic. For example, formula_5 and formula_6 are both transcendental extensions of formula_7

A transcendence basis of a field extension formula_1 (or a transcendence basis of formula_2 over formula_3) is a maximal algebraically independent subset of formula_2 over formula_12 Transcendence bases share many properties with bases of vector spaces. In particular, all transcendence bases of a field extension have the same cardinality, called the transcendence degree of the extension. Thus, a field extension is a transcendental extension if and only if its transcendence degree is nonzero.

Transcendental extensions are widely used in algebraic geometry. For example, the dimension of an algebraic variety is the transcendence degree of its function field. Also, global function fields are transcendental extensions of degree one of a finite field, and play in number theory in positive characteristic a role that is very similar to the role of algebraic number fields in characteristic zero.

== Transcendence basis ==
Zorn&#x27;s lemma shows there exists a maximal linearly independent subset of a vector space (i.e., a basis). A similar argument with Zorn&#x27;s lemma shows that, given a field extension &quot;L&quot; / &quot;K&quot;, there exists a maximal algebraically independent subset of &quot;L&quot; over &quot;K&quot;. It is then called a transcendence basis. By maximality, an algebraically independent subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;L&quot; over &quot;K&quot; is a transcendence basis if and only if &quot;L&quot; is an algebraic extension of &quot;K&quot;(&quot;S&quot;), the field obtained by adjoining the elements of &quot;S&quot; to &quot;K&quot;.

The exchange lemma (a version for algebraically independent sets) implies that if &quot;S&quot; and &quot;S&#x27;&quot; are transcendence bases, then &quot;S&quot; and &quot;S&#x27;&quot; have the same cardinality. Then the common cardinality of transcendence bases is called the transcendence degree of &quot;L&quot; over &quot;K&quot; and is denoted as formula_13 or formula_14. There is thus an analogy: a transcendence basis and transcendence degree, on the one hand, and a basis and dimension on the other hand. This analogy can be made more formal, by observing that linear independence in vector spaces and algebraic independence in field extensions both form examples of finitary matroids (pregeometries). Any finitary matroid has a basis, and all bases have the same cardinality.

If &quot;G&quot; is a generating set of &quot;L&quot; (i.e., &quot;L&quot; = &quot;K&quot;(&quot;G&quot;)), then a transcendence basis for &quot;L&quot; can be taken as a subset of &quot;G&quot;. Thus, formula_15 the minimum cardinality of generating sets of &quot;L&quot; over &quot;K&quot;. In particular, a finitely generated field extension admits a finite transcendence basis.

If no field &quot;K&quot; is specified, the transcendence degree of a field &quot;L&quot; is its degree relative to some fixed base field; for example, the prime field of the same characteristic, or &quot;K&quot;, if &quot;L&quot; is an algebraic function field over &quot;K&quot;.

The field extension &quot;L&quot; / &quot;K&quot; is purely transcendental if there is a subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;L&quot; that is algebraically independent over &quot;K&quot; and such that &quot;L&quot; = &quot;K&quot;(&quot;S&quot;).

A separating transcendence basis of &quot;L&quot; / &quot;K&quot; is a transcendence basis &quot;S&quot; such that &quot;L&quot; is a separable algebraic extension over &quot;K&quot;(&quot;S&quot;). A field extension &quot;L&quot; / &quot;K&quot; is said to be separably generated if it admits a separating transcendence basis. If a field extension is finitely generated and it is also separably generated, then each generating set of the field extension contains a separating transcendence basis. Over a perfect field, every finitely generated field extension is separably generated; i.e., it admits a finite separating transcendence basis.

== Examples ==

*An extension is algebraic if and only if its transcendence degree is 0; the empty set serves as a transcendence basis here.
*The field of rational functions in &quot;n&quot; variables &quot;K&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) (i.e. the field of fractions of the polynomial ring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;]) is a purely transcendental extension with transcendence degree &quot;n&quot; over &quot;K&quot;; we can for example take {&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;} as a transcendence base.
*More generally, the transcendence degree of the function field &quot;L&quot; of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional algebraic variety over a ground field &quot;K&quot; is &quot;n&quot;.
*Q(√2, &quot;e&quot;) has transcendence degree 1 over Q because √2 is algebraic while &quot;e&quot; is transcendental. 
*The transcendence degree of C or R over Q is the cardinality of the continuum. (Since Q is countable, the field Q(&quot;S&quot;) will have the same cardinality as &quot;S&quot; for any infinite set &quot;S&quot;, and any algebraic extension of Q(&quot;S&quot;) will have the same cardinality again.)
*The transcendence degree of Q(&quot;e&quot;, π) over Q is either 1 or 2; the precise answer is unknown because it is not known whether &quot;e&quot; and π are algebraically independent (see Schanuel&#x27;s conjecture).
*If &quot;S&quot; is a compact Riemann surface, the field C(&quot;S&quot;) of meromorphic functions on &quot;S&quot; has transcendence degree 1 over C.

:trdeg(&quot;M&quot; / &quot;K&quot;) = trdeg(&quot;M&quot; / &quot;L&quot;) + trdeg(&quot;L&quot; / &quot;K&quot;)

This is proven by showing that a transcendence basis of &quot;M&quot; / &quot;K&quot; can be obtained by taking the union of a transcendence basis of &quot;M&quot; / &quot;L&quot; and one of &quot;L&quot; / &quot;K&quot;.

If the set &quot;S&quot; is algebraically independent over &quot;K,&quot; then the field &quot;K&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) is isomorphic to the field of rational functions over &quot;K&quot; in a set of variables of the same cardinality as &quot;S.&quot; Each such rational function is a fraction of two polynomials in finitely many of those variables, with coefficients in &quot;K.&quot;

Two algebraically closed fields are isomorphic if and only if they have the same characteristic and the same transcendence degree over their prime field.

== The transcendence degree of an integral domain ==
Let formula_16 be integral domains. If formula_17 and formula_18 denote the fields of fractions of and , then the &quot;transcendence degree&quot; of over is defined as the transcendence degree of the field extension formula_19

The Noether normalization lemma implies that if is an integral domain that is a finitely generated algebra over a field , then the Krull dimension of is the transcendence degree of over .

This has the following geometric interpretation: if is an affine algebraic variety over a field , the Krull dimension of its coordinate ring equals the transcendence degree of its function field, and this defines the dimension of . It follows that, if is not an affine variety, its dimension (defined as the transcendence degree of its function field) can also be defined &quot;locally&quot; as the Krull dimension of the coordinate ring of the restriction of the variety to an open affine subset.

== Relations to differentials ==
Let formula_20 be a finitely generated field extension. Then
:formula_21
where formula_22 denotes the module of Kahler differentials. Also, in the above, the equality holds if and only if &quot;K&quot; is separably generated over &quot;k&quot; (meaning it admits a separating transcendence basis).

== Applications ==

Transcendence bases are useful for proving various existence statements about field homomorphisms. Here is an example: Given an algebraically closed field &quot;L&quot;, a subfield &quot;K&quot; and a field automorphism &quot;f&quot; of &quot;K&quot;, there exists a field automorphism of &quot;L&quot; which extends &quot;f&quot; (i.e. whose restriction to &quot;K&quot; is &quot;f&quot;). For the proof, one starts with a transcendence basis &quot;S&quot; of &quot;L&quot; / &quot;K&quot;. The elements of &quot;K&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) are just quotients of polynomials in elements of &quot;S&quot; with coefficients in &quot;K&quot;; therefore the automorphism &quot;f&quot; can be extended to one of &quot;K&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) by sending every element of &quot;S&quot; to itself. The field &quot;L&quot; is the algebraic closure of &quot;K&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) and algebraic closures are unique up to isomorphism; this means that the automorphism can be further extended from &quot;K&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) to &quot;L&quot;.

As another application, we show that there are (many) proper subfields of the complex number field C which are (as fields) isomorphic to C. For the proof, take a transcendence basis &quot;S&quot; of C / Q. &quot;S&quot; is an infinite (even uncountable) set, so there exist (many) maps &quot;f&quot;: &quot;S&quot; → &quot;S&quot; which are injective but not surjective. Any such map can be extended to a field homomorphism Q(&quot;S&quot;) → Q(&quot;S&quot;) which is not surjective. Such a field homomorphism can in turn be extended to the algebraic closure C, and the resulting field homomorphisms C → C are not surjective.

The transcendence degree can give an intuitive understanding of the size of a field. For instance, a theorem due to Siegel states that if &quot;X&quot; is a compact, connected, complex manifold of dimension &quot;n&quot; and &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) denotes the field of (globally defined) meromorphic functions on it, then trdegC(&quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)) ≤ &quot;n&quot;.

<text>Guilhermina Augusta Xavier de Medim Suggia Carteado Mena, known as Guilhermina Suggia (27 June 1885 – 30 July 1950) was a Portuguese cellist. She studied in Paris with Pablo Casals, and built up an international reputation. She spent many years living in the United Kingdom, where she was particularly celebrated. She retired in 1939, but emerged from retirement to give concerts in Britain. Her last was in 1949, the year before her death.

Suggia bequeathed her instrument to be sold to fund the Suggia Gift, an important British scholarship for young cellists.

==Biography==

Suggia was born in Porto to a family of Portuguese and Italian descent. Her father was a competent musician and taught her musical theory and cello. Such was her progress that by the age of 12 she was appointed principal cellist of the local orchestra, the Orpheon Portuense. In 1904, under the patronage of Queen Maria Amélia of Portugal, she went to study at Leipzig under Julius Klengel. Although Klengel was a professor at the Leipzig Conservatoire, Suggia did not enroll there but rather took private lessons from him.

Within a year Suggia was asked to appear as a soloist with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra under its conductor, Arthur Nikisch. From 1906 to 1912 she lived and worked in Paris with the cellist Pablo Casals. It was generally believed, incorrectly, that the two were married, and Suggia was sometimes billed as &quot;Mme P. Casals-Suggia&quot;. She began to tour internationally, building her reputation. She and Casals were rated as &quot;the world&#x27;s leading cellists&quot;. Casals was close friends with composer Donald Tovey, who wrote his &quot;Sonata for two cellos&quot; for the pair. On his visiting the couple to present the work in 1912, an unknown event occurred between Suggia and Tovey which caused strain on the relationship between Suggia and Casals, and the friendship between Tovey and Casals. After they separated, Suggia retained her admiration for Casals, describing him as pre-eminent among living cellists. In 1914 she formed a trio with the violinist Jelly d&#x27;Arányi and the pianist Fanny Davies. 

During the period of her residence in Britain during the 1920s and 1930s, she was a frequent visitor to Lindisfarne Castle in northern England, where a cello now rests in the Music Room in commemoration of her time spent there. Her &quot;Montagnana&quot; cello rests in Conservatório de Música do Porto, her home town in Portugal. 

Edward Hudson, the founder of the British magazine &quot;Country Life&quot; is said to have been infatuated by Guilhermina. He was briefly engaged to her and bought her the aforementioned Montagnana cello, which she is shown playing in the portrait by Augustus John referred to below.
In 1927, Suggia married Jose Mena, an X-ray specialist. During World War II, Suggia and her husband returned to Portugal, where she lived in retirement. She visited Britain after the war, giving performances of the Elgar Cello Concerto in aid of charity. She gave her last concerts at the Edinburgh Festival in 1949 and in Bournemouth later the same year.

While in Britain in the 1920s she taught various British cellists, and after returning to Portugal she continued to teach, with notable students including Amaryllis Fleming, Thelma Reiss, Sheridan Russell and Peggie Sampson. Russell criticised her as a teacher because she attempted to make students imitate her precise technique.

Suggia died of cancer in Porto at the age of 65, a year after the death of her husband.

==Recordings==
Suggia made a small number of gramophone recordings. They include Haydn&#x27;s D major Concerto with John Barbirolli and Saint-Saëns&#x27;s A minor Concerto with Lawrance Collingwood. They were reissued on compact disc in 1989 (EMI EH761083-1). A compilation CD was released in 2004 with performances of Haydn, Max Bruch and Lalo (Dutton CDBP9748).

==Legacy==
Suggia bequeathed her Stradivarius cello to the Royal Academy of Music in London, to be sold to fund a scholarship for young cellists. The Suggia Gift, established in 1955, has since 1995 been administered by the Musicians&#x27; Benevolent Fund. The first holder was Derek Simpson, and other winners include Rohan de Saram (1955), Jacqueline du Pré (1956–1961), Robert Cohen (1967–1971), Hafliði Hallgrímsson, Steven Isserlis, Raphael Wallfisch and Julian Lloyd Webber. In 2010 it was announced that the 2011 Suggia Gift would be run in association with the 2011 International Guilhermina Suggia Festival, held in her native city.

The large auditorium at Casa da Música in Porto is named Sala Suggia in her honour.

TAP Portugal, the national airline, named one of its aeroplanes (an Airbus A319) after her.

Probably the most famous image of Suggia is the oil portrait by the Welsh artist Augustus John, whose daughter Amaryllis Fleming later became a well-known cellist herself. This picture was commissioned initially by Edward Hudson (see above) and begun in 1920 but not finished till 1923. It was shown at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh in 1924, bought by an American but later returned to England and presented to the Tate Gallery. The painting measures 186 X 165 cm. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; wrote of this work that it &quot;will serve to remind future generations that here was a musician who matched the nobility of her art with that of her presence on the concert platform.&quot; Photographs of Suggia by Alvin Langdon Coburn are held in the George Eastman House Still Photograph Archive and a photographic portrait by Bertram Park is in the National Portrait Gallery in London.

<text>The National Secular Society (NSS) is a British campaigning organisation that promotes secularism and the separation of church and state. It holds that no one should gain advantage or disadvantage because of their religion or lack of it. The Society was founded in 1866 by Charles Bradlaugh.

==Objectives==
The NSS, whose motto is &quot;Challenging religious privilege&quot;, campaigns for a secular state where there is no established state religion; where religion plays no role in state-funded education, does not interfere with the judicial process nor does it restrict freedom of expression; where the state does not intervene in matters of religious doctrine nor does it promote or fund religious activities, guaranteeing every citizen&#x27;s freedom to believe, not to believe or to change religion.

Although the organisation was explicitly created for those who reject the supernatural, the NSS does not campaign to eradicate or prohibit religion, arguing that freedom of religion, as well as freedom from religion, is a human right and that state sponsorship of selected religions encroaches upon that right. It holds that belief should be a private matter for the home or place of worship and does not belong in the public sphere. In seeking to represent the interests and viewpoints of atheists, the NSS is often critical of what it sees as the damaging effects of religion.

== History ==

The National Secular Society was founded in 1866 with Charles Bradlaugh as president and Charles Watts as secretary. There were a number of secularist groups around the UK and they joined up to coordinate and strengthen their campaigns. The word &quot;secularism&quot; was coined by George Holyoake in 1851. The NSS&#x27;s principles asserted that &quot;this is the only life we have, and that we should work for its improvement&quot;.

In 1877 Bradlaugh and Annie Besant were prosecuted for publishing a book containing birth control information, &quot;The Fruits of Philosophy&quot; by the American doctor Charles Knowlton. They were convicted, but acquitted on appeal. The issue of contraception divided secularists and a breakaway group, the British Secular Union, was formed. It closed after a few years.

Bradlaugh&#x27;s struggle to enter Parliament became an important moment in the development of nineteenth-century secularism. He was elected for Northampton in 1880. He believed he had the right to affirm rather than swear on the Bible, but when refused, said he would take the oath. He was told that since he did not believe in the Bible he could not swear on it. For six years he struggled to overcome this problem, by legal and electoral methods. In 1886 a new government allowed him to be sworn in. He later brought about a change giving all MPs the right to affirm. He was a very active MP on behalf of the poor, the Irish and Indian independence.

Bradlaugh, who died in 1891, was succeeded as president by G. W. Foote, editor of &quot;The Freethinker&quot;. Foote noted that the death of Bradlaugh brought the &quot;heroic period&quot; of freethought to an end, and he never succeeded in galvanising NSS members as Bradlaugh had done. Foote&#x27;s successor was Chapman Cohen (president from 1915 to 1949), a prolific pamphleteer and author of books on religion and philosophy for a popular audience. In the first half of the twentieth century the NSS campaigned against the BBC&#x27;s religious broadcasting policy, for disestablishment and for secular education.

Notable presidents in the second half of the twentieth century were David Tribe and Barbara Smoker, who did much to increase the use of the media to put across secularist views. In the twenty-first century, the NSS continues as an organisation campaigning in the UK and EU against what it regards as religious privilege in public life.

==Organisation==
The NSS is incorporated as a UK Company Limited by Guarantee, no. 01418145. The Society&#x27;s income in the year 2006–2007 was £232,149, as quoted in the Accounts submitted to the authorities at Companies House. It receives no funding from the government or outside bodies: its campaigning is wholly supported by membership subscriptions and donations. Membership numbers are not included on the NSS website, although an article in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on 13 February 2012 stated that the society had about 7,000 members.

==Education and faith schools==
Education is one of the NSS&#x27;s prime concerns, and it continues to campaign against public funding of faith schools. It holds that morality, ethics and citizenship should be taught outside a religious framework. It also opposes the teaching of creationism, or intelligent design as an alternative to mainstream science. In addition, it is against the appointment of teachers and support staff according to religious criteria, as part of a more general campaign against exemptions from anti-discrimination legislation for religious bodies. The Society has successfully campaigned for the legal right of older pupils to opt themselves out of religious assemblies at school.

The Society argues that children of families of no-faith and &quot;the wrong faith&quot; are being increasingly discriminated against in admission procedures, because of the high number of religious schools. Together with City Technology Colleges (which also have admissions privileges), the Society would like to see these schools become community schools, although it accepts the need for a transition period to achieve this goal. The NSS has drawn attention to recent statistical research supporting its claims of discrimination in faith schools, based on selection of pupils from wealthier families. Specifically, religious schools take in 10% fewer poor pupils than are representative of the local area. However, both representatives from the Church of England and a separate Parent Association denied the existence or evidence of selection to their own schools being based on social background, and a spokesman for the Centre of Economics has indicated that the bias in social background may stem from those more likely to apply to a religious school, not the selection process.

The NSS has claimed that faith schools exacerbate religious, ethnic and cultural divisions, by separating children from those of other faiths and cultural backgrounds. In 2010, the NSS instigated a judicial review to test the legality of prayers being part of the official business of Council meetings, as it believes politics and religion should be kept separate.

== Other campaigns ==
The NSS has campaigned on a number of other issues. These include the successful abolition of the blasphemy law in the United Kingdom; removal of the 26 bishops from the House of Lords; exemption of religious organisations from discrimination and equality laws; withdrawal of state funding of chaplains in prisons, hospitals and armed services; the end of tax exemption for churches; and stopping public funding of religious broadcasting (the NSS has long argued, for example, that &quot;Thought for the Day&quot; is religious propaganda broadcast by the BBC at licence-payers&#x27; expense).

Further campaigns are concerned with the conscientious objections by doctors and pharmacists to refuse to administer certain procedures or treatments; the religious exemption from laws requiring stunning of animals before slaughter and for the labelling of meat produced without stunning (much of it is currently sold to the general public unlabelled, both in shops and in restaurants); and the reform of the Scouts movement to remove references to God from their promise.

The NSS is frequently invited to submit consultation documents to Government and major UK organisations. For example, it has written about faith-based welfare; doctors&#x27; conscientious objections; the prosecution of racist and religious crimes; the census; organ donation; and equality issues.

It co-sponsored the launch of the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain and a conference for International Women&#x27;s Day – Women&#x27;s Rights, the Veil and Islamic and Religious Laws.

As well as its activities in the UK, the NSS has been active in Europe and at the UN, often as a representative for the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU). Most notable have been interventions at the Council of Europe and the European Parliament.

At a Council of Europe conference in San Marino, its interventions caused the closing communiqué to be changed to require consultation on inter-cultural matters, giving much more emphasis to civil society, as opposed to religious bodies. In Strasbourg, the NSS argued against what it saw as undue religious influence on the Council of Europe. Close links have been maintained with the politicians and secretariat.

The NSS started assisting Roy Brown on the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, and continues on a broader front, raising awareness of its problems with a growing list of international bodies.

In the European Parliament (EP), the NSS is involved with the Separation of Religion &amp; Politics Working Group, and attended the launch of the Brussels Declaration. The organisation&#x27;s president, Keith Porteous Wood, also spoke at a meeting in the EP sponsored by Catholics for Choice on Religion &amp; Politics in the New Europe, and made a representation in a debate to the EP President about an invitation to the Pope to address the EP. The Society continues to be consulted by politicians seeking information or proposals. Wood spoke about problems with the United Nations Human Rights Commission at a UDHR 60th Anniversary Conference in Brussels, and at the Libre Penseé Conference at the Senate in Paris.

On 2 December 2011, the NSS and an atheist councillor took Bideford Town Council to the High Court over prayers held during council meetings. The High Court ruled on 10 February 2012 that the town council was not acting lawfully, as under Section 111 of the Local Government Act 1972 councils could not do anything they were not specifically permitted to do by the act. As prayers were not mentioned by the act, they could not be held as a formal part of the meeting. However, the judge tempered this ruling by rejecting Councillor Bone&#x27;s argument that his human rights had been breached, stating that prayers could be held as long as councillors were not summoned to attend and they did not appear as an item on the agenda. Mr Justice Ouseley declared that the fact that atheists might feel uncomfortable during prayers was not a reason for them to be granted the protection of the state under human rights law, which had been the argument of the NSS&#x27;s counsel. At the time of the case, the 1972 act was being superseded by the Localism Act 2011, which gave councils a general power of competence &#x27;to do anything individuals may generally do.&#x27; In light of the ruling, the law was brought into force ahead of schedule in February 2012, and its general power of competence was asserted to have restored the ability of councils to hold prayers as part of the meeting should the majority of them wish to do so. To remove any remaining confusion, in March 2015 the Local Government (Religious etc. Observances) Act 2015 was granted Royal Assent, explicitly restoring the right of councils to hold prayers as a formal part of meetings should they wish.

The NSS has campaigned against the practice of some local authorities in granting parking concessions to churchgoers. In 2011, the NSS announced its intention to take forward a legal challenge against Woking Borough Council, which allowed those attending services in churches close to the town centre to claim a refund of their parking charges. The policy was retained following a review, but the council indicated the scheme could be extended to members of all religious communities or voluntary organisations on a case-by-case basis. Some councillors were critical of the challenge and the amount spent on defending the policy, with one councillor referring to the National Secular Society as &#x27;bullying and intolerant.&#x27;

In February 2019, the NSS released a 48-page report titled &quot;For the Public Benefit? The case of removing &#x27;the advancement of religion&#x27; as a charitable purpose&quot;. It argues that the advancement of religion should not be &#x27;regarded as an inherent public good&#x27;, and charities should be required to &#x27;demonstrate a tangible, secular public benefit under one of the other charitable purpose headings&#x27;.

== Secularist of the Year award ==
Each year, the NSS holds the &quot;Secularist of the Year&quot; award ceremony at which the &quot;Irwin Prize&quot; of £5,000 is presented.
Nominations for the Secularist of the Year are made by members of the National Secular Society; the winner is chosen by the Officers of the Society, along with Michael Irwin, who has donated the funds which underpin the award. Previous prize winners include former Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) Evan Harris, Lord Avebury, Sophie in &#x27;t Veld MEP and Peter Tatchell.

<text>Karl von Abel (September 17, 1788 – September 3, 1859) was a Bavarian statesman.

Born in Wetzlar, Abel was the son of a at the superior Court of Justice. He studied law in Gießen from 1806-1809, and became a civil servant of Bavaria in 1810.

In 1817 he was appointed city and police commissar in Bamberg, in 1819, Governmental Councillor in Munich, and in 1827 promoted to Senior Legal Secretary. In the Diet of 1831 he gave a speech in favour of freedom of the press and against censorship.

In the following year, Abel was assigned by King Ludwig I to be a part of the delegation accompanying the young King Otto to Greece. He joined with Georg Ludwig von Maurer in opposing the head of the delegation, Count Josef Ludwig von Armansperg, who he felt was too susceptible to the wishes of the English diplomats. However, the count was able to mobilise his supporters in Munich and have Abel and Maurer unseated from the delegation. Abel once again became Legal Secretary in the Ministry of the Interior. He married Friederike von Rinecker in 1836, a very religious woman, who had much influence on him.

On 1 November 1837, Abel became Privy Councillor in place of Ludwig, Fürst von Wallerstein and began to lead the Ministry of the Interior. At this time, the Cologne Troubles excited the masses on religious and political levels. Soon enough the Ministry under Abel proved to be strictly Catholic, following the traditions of Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The status of the clergy was raised and large sums were spent for religious issues. This was followed by several edicts, for example prescribing that Protestant soldiers must also genuflect during a Catholic service. The formation of Evangelic communities and the execution of their services was made complicated and restricted and strict censorship applied to all opposing movements.

In other issues Abel showed his absolutist and ultramontane position. He authorized an edict disallowing the use of all &quot;modern terms, which try to foist the principle of classes with a representative one&quot;. As an example, the term of &quot;Ministry of the State&quot; was forbidden as the king must unite all power in himself. Several affronts against his precursor Wallerstein resulted in a duel which he lost.

Wallerstein lead the opposition forming mainly in the newly acquired provinces of the kingdom against the paternalism of the Ministry. In the Diet of 1846 he openly fought the existing system. Abel could not avert the claims that he had broken the principle of parity, and that the Christian party was in contact with radical elements. For this the King lost his trust in Abel, and removed him as Ministry of Culture and Education.

Abel was dismissed from power on 17 February 1847 when he and the other ministers opposed the naturalisation of the Kings&#x27; young lady Lola Montez. Afterwards, he had not only to suffer the disgrace of the king he had served for a long time, but was also repudiated by the members of his own party. He was appointed as envoy to the Kingdom of Sardinia, but refused to take the charge until the reign of Maximilian II of Bavaria. In 1848 Abel was voted into the Second Chamber of the Bavarian Parliament, where his former administration was attacked from all sides.

Abel was recalled as envoy in 1850 and retired from the political life. Until his death in 1859 he lived on his tenure Stamsried manor in Upper Palatinate.

He died in Munich.

<doc id="287384" wikidata="Q334971" url="?curid=287384" title="John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll">
<text>John George Edward Henry Douglas Sutherland Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll (6 August 1845 – 2 May 1914), known by the courtesy title Marquess of Lorne, by which he was known between 1847 and 1900, was a British nobleman who was Governor General of Canada from 1878 to 1883. He was the husband of Princess Louise, fourth daughter of Queen Victoria. He was the first president of Rangers Football Club, thanks to his Argyll ties to the original founders of the football club.

==Background and career==
Campbell was born in London, the eldest son of George, Marquess of Lorne and the former Lady Elizabeth Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, daughter of the 2nd Duke of Sutherland, and was styled Earl of Campbell from birth. In 1847, when he was 21 months old, his father succeeded as 8th Duke of Argyll and he assumed the courtesy title Marquess of Lorne, which he bore until he was 54. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy, Eton College, St Andrews and at Trinity College, Cambridge, as well as at the National Art Training School.

For ten years before coming to Canada, Lorne travelled throughout North and Central America, writing travel literature and poetry. In the UK, he represented, from 1868, the constituency of Argyllshire as a Liberal Member of Parliament in the House of Commons. He made little impression there, however; the &quot;London World&quot; referred to Lorne as &quot;a non-entity in the House of Commons, and a non-entity without.&quot; A.C. Benson, who edited Queen Victoria&#x27;s letters and spent time in the company of the royals, gave him the same epithet.

He was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the part-time 1st Argyll and Bute Artillery Volunteers on 13 July 1866. He gave up the position in the 1880s, but was appointed the unit&#x27;s Honorary Colonel on 18 July 1900.

Lord Lorne married Queen Victoria&#x27;s fourth daughter, Princess Louise, on 21 March 1871. This was the first time a legitimate daughter of the sovereign had married a subject of the Crown since 1515, when Charles Brandon, the first Duke of Suffolk, married Mary Tudor. The pair shared a common love of the arts, but the marriage was childless and unhappy, and they spent much time apart. Lorne formed close friendships with men, including Lord Ronald Gower, Morton Fullerton and the Count de Mauny, who were known to be homosexual or bisexual, which fuelled rumours in London society that he shared their predisposition. No conclusive evidence has been found to settle this issue either way.

==Governor General of Canada==
When Lord Lorne&#x27;s appointment was announced, there was great excitement throughout Canada. For the first time, Rideau Hall would have a royal resident. The Canadian Prime Minister relaxed his busy campaign schedule to prepare for her arrival and to organise a special carriage and corps of guards to protect the Princess. An author wrote in 1880 that &quot;the appointment was hailed with satisfaction in all parts of the Dominion, and the new Governor General entered upon his term of office with the hearts of the people strongly prepossessed in his favour.&quot;

However, Campbell and his wife were initially not received well by the Canadian press, which complained about the imposition of royalty on the country&#x27;s hitherto un-regal society, a position that was only exacerbated by mishaps and misunderstandings. The worries of a rigid court at the Queen&#x27;s Canadian residence turned out to be unfounded; the couple were more relaxed than their predecessors, as demonstrated at the many ice skating and tobogganing parties, balls, dinners, and other state occasions hosted by the Marquess and Marchioness.

At age 33, Lord Lorne was Canada&#x27;s youngest governor general and he became the first representative of Queen Victoria to have been born during the latter&#x27;s reign but he was not too young to handle the marginal demands of his post. He and Princess Louise made many lasting contributions to Canadian society, especially in the arts and sciences. They encouraged the establishment of the Royal Society of Canada, the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, and the National Gallery of Canada, even selecting some of its first paintings. Campbell was involved in the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway and other projects, such as a hospital for British Columbia.
Throughout his term of office, Lorne was intensely interested in Canada and Canadians. He travelled throughout the country, encouraging the establishment of numerous institutions, and met with First Nations and other Canadians from all walks of life. At Rideau Hall, he and Princess Louise hosted many social functions, including numerous ice skating and tobogganing parties as well as balls, dinners and state occasions. His small collection of First Nations artefacts was purchased by the British Museum in 1887.

==After Canada==
Princess Louise returned to England in 1881 and Lord Lorne followed two years later in 1883, when his book, &quot;Memories of Canada and Scotland&quot;, was published.

In 1907, strenuous efforts were taken by officials to ensure that Lorne&#x27;s name was not dragged into the investigation of the theft of the Irish Crown Jewels. This was due to the fact that his closest friend was Lord Ronald Gower, who while innocent, was associated with several of the circle who were implicated in it.

Lorne was Governor and Constable of Windsor Castle from 1892 to 1914 and he sat as MP for Manchester South from 1895 until the death of his father on 24 April 1900, when he succeeded as 9th and 2nd Duke of Argyll. He and Princess Louise lived at Kensington Palace until his death from pneumonia in 1914. He is buried at Kilmun Parish Church.

<doc id="287386" wikidata="Q2190405" url="?curid=287386" title="Giovanni Francesco Abela">
<text>Giovanni Francesco Abela (1582–1655) was a Maltese noble who in the early 17th century wrote an important work on Malta, &quot;Della Descrittione di Malta isola nel Mare Siciliano: con le sue antichità, ed altre notizie&quot;, &quot;description of Malta, island in the Sicilian sea, with its antiquities, and other information&quot;.

== Early life ==
Abela was born in Valletta to Marco Abela and Benarda Vella whose great great grandfather was Barone di Pietra Lunga and whose ancestors ruled Malta on more than one occasion and were part of the royal family of Spain.

== Works ==
Malta illustrated is still an important source of first-hand information on a number of subjects of Melitensia, such as folklore, placenames, the Maltese language, history of Malta and archaeology. His description of the Maltese Islands was translated into Latin by G.A. Seinero in 1725, Latin being the universal language of science and culture of that time. This translation was incorporated in Johann Georg Graevius Thesaurus antiquitatum et historiarum Italiae. 
He became Auditor of Grand Master Antoine de Paule, Chaplain and finally Vice Chancellor of the Knights Hospitaller. He is also remembered as the promoter of the first Notarial Archives for Malta.

Gian Francesco Abela visited archaeological sites on the islands and made some valuable observations. He appears to have been the first to note that the ancient temple of Hercules was to be identified with the remains on the hill at Tas-Silġ rather than those of Borġ in-Nadur. At Tas-Silġ he observed foundations and courses of stones ‘ben lavorate e messe insieme,’ and in support of his identification he recorded the discovery of ‘medaglie, pezzi di statue d’idoletti, e d’altre cose, minimi avanzi di quella vana gentilità e falsa religione, quivi ritrovate sotto il Magistero del Principe Wignacourt, mentre alcuni nell’istesso luogo cavando, scioccamente pensavano far acquisto di ricco tesoro.’

In the early 17th century Abela converted his house at Marsa to a historical museum, the first in Malta. Many of its artefacts are now stored in Malta&#x27;s National Museum of Archaeology.

<text>Operation Shylock: A Confession is a 1993 novel by American novelist Philip Roth.

==Plot==
The novel follows narrator &quot;Philip Roth&quot; on a journey to Israel, where he attends the trial of accused war criminal John Demjanjuk and becomes involved in an intelligence mission—the &quot;Operation Shylock&quot; of the title.

While in Israel, the narrator seeks out an impersonator who has appropriated his identity. This man has Roth&#x27;s facial features, goes by the same name, and uses Roth&#x27;s status as a celebrity author to spread &quot;Diasporism&quot;, a counter-Zionist ideology advocating the return, to Europe, of all formerly European Jews who have become Israeli.

The ensuing struggle between this doppelgänger-like stranger and &quot;Roth&quot;, played against the backdrop of the Demjanjuk trial and the First Intifada, constitutes the book&#x27;s primary storyline. Roth becomes romantically involved with Jinx Posseski, his doppelgänger&#x27;s lover and partner in crime. This makes it harder for him to hold the line against the imposter, because he feels guilty. He also has several unsuccessful face-to-face confrontations with his double; each time, the other &quot;Philip Roth&quot; (whom Roth dubs &quot;Moishe Pipik&quot;) gets the better of the original, genuine Roth by accusing him of taking his fame too lightly, and eschewing his responsibilities to people in the real world.

Because the central proposition of &quot;Diasporism&quot; is highly amenable to the PLO, a former friend named George Ziad, who knew the real Philip Roth in college, attempts to put Roth in contact with the actual PLO. (Ziad thinks Roth is a Diasporist, thanks to Moishe Pipik.) Roth intends to refuse until he is contacted by agents of Mossad, Israel&#x27;s intelligence agency. They urge him to accept Ziad&#x27;s offer, so that he can become an undercover agent and gather intelligence for Israel.

Roth apparently does so, but the end of the book reveals that &quot;Operation Shylock&quot; is (supposedly) missing an excised chapter where Roth describes the details and outcome of his Mossad mission. The book ends without resolving the questions the &quot;lost&quot; chapter raises, including whether Roth continues to support the Israeli cause, and whether or not it is important for Roth to tell his readers such details about his life. The revelation that Mossad has been watching Roth (largely through disguised agents) and trying to involve him in Israel&#x27;s political intrigues leaves Roth looking rather hapless and myopic in terms of his ability to understand realpolitik and the way power functions in his present-day (the year 1988).

==Connections==
A major concern of Roth&#x27;s fiction since the 1970s has been the relationship between a novelist&#x27;s life and work. Though this topic is thoroughly explored in Roth&#x27;s series of Zuckerman novels, &quot;Operation Shylock&quot; even more radically attacks the distinction between art and life by making a fairly mimetic version of the author the protagonist of an obviously invented (though plausible) story.

Despite this effort, separating the real from the fictional in &quot;Operation Shylock&quot; is not wholly impossible. For example, several minor characters from the novel are actual people including John Demjanjuk, Claire Bloom, and Israeli writer and Roth friend Aharon Appelfeld. The post-operative nervous breakdown mentioned in the prologue and in other books by or about Roth was drawn from Roth&#x27;s real-life experience of the temporary side-effects of a post-operative sedative (triazolam) which was later banned in several countries after discovery that the manufacturer had not published studies showing a high risk of short term psychiatric disturbance.

==Roth&#x27;s &quot;confession&quot;==
In March 1993, Roth maintained the veracity of his novel to &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Esther B. Fein, who wrote, &quot;&quot;Operation Shylock&quot;, Roth insists with a post-modern straight face, is a &#x27;confession,&#x27; not a novel, and he means for us to take this every bit as seriously as the contents labels demanded by the strictures of the Food and Drug Administration. &#x27;The book is true,&#x27; Roth said the other day. &#x27;As you know, at the end of the book a Mossad operative made me realize it was in my interest to say this book was fiction. And I became quite convinced that it was in my interest to do that. So I added the note to the reader as I was asked to do. I&#x27;m just a good sayan.&#x27;&quot;

==Reception==
Roth&#x27;s long-time professional acquaintance John Updike gave the novel a famously caustic review in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Updike found the book &quot;an orgy of argumentation...this hard-pressed reviewer was reminded not only of Shaw but of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which also has too many characters, numerous long speeches, and a vacillating, maddening hero who in the end shows the right stuff.&quot; Updike closed with the admonition, &quot;It should be read by anyone who cares about (1) Israel and its repercussions, (2) the development of the postmodern, deconstruction-minded novel, (3) Philip Roth.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, novelist and poet D. M. Thomas called the novel &quot;an impassioned quarrel...Despite the seriousness of its theme, the book carries the feeling of creative joy. One feels that Roth feels that he&#x27;s &quot;let rip.&quot;&quot;

The novel appears to have grown in stature since publication. In 2006, when &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; editor Sam Tanenhaus mailed a short letter to &quot;a couple of hundred prominent writers, critics, editors,&quot; asking that they identify the best work of American fiction published in the preceding quarter-century, several respondents named &quot;Operation Shylock.&quot; (The eventual winner was Toni Morrison&#x27;s 1987 &quot;Beloved&quot;.) Reporting upon Roth&#x27;s reception of the 2011 Man Booker International Prize, critic Jonathan Derbyshire of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; wrote, &quot;The judging panel make the inevitable reference in their summing-up to Roth&#x27;s extraordinary fecundity over the past 15 years or so, at a stage in his life when &#x27;most novelists are in decline&#x27;. The most notable fruits of Roth&#x27;s Indian summer, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Sabbath&#x27;s Theater&quot; and &quot;American Pastoral&quot;, published two years later, are certainly among his most luminous achievements. But two slightly earlier novels stand out for me, both of them hectically metafictional works partly set in Israel: &quot;The Counterlife&quot; (1986) and &quot;Operation Shylock&quot;.&quot;

After Roth&#x27;s death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; asked several prominent writers to name their favorite book by him. Daniel Mendelsohn cast his vote for &quot;Operation Shylock&quot;, writing: &quot;Here, the coruscating linguistic brilliance, the profanity and playfulness (and the deep, often irritated engagement with Jewishness) that characterizes his earlier novels rise to new — and, I would say, philosophical — heights. For the two Roths finally meet in a Jerusalem that is anxiously hosting the trial of John Demjanjuk, the Ukrainian-born Ohio autoworker who was revealed to have been a sadistic guard at a Nazi death camp: a setting that amplifies the significance of Roth&#x27;s favorite themes of identity and imposture, truth and fictionality, and gives the ostensibly zany, Quixote&quot;-&quot;esque plot an ultimately tragic historical resonance.&quot;

==Awards==
&quot;Operation Shylock&quot; received the 1993 PEN/Faulkner Award for best novel. Roth would eventually become the first three-time winner of the award: for &quot;Shylock&quot;, 2001&#x27;s &quot;The Human Stain&quot;, and 2007&#x27;s &quot;Everyman&quot;.

<doc id="287395" wikidata="Q336879" url="?curid=287395" title="Aben Humeya">
<text>Aben Humeya (1520–1569), also known as Muhammad ibn Umayyah (), was a Morisco leader who commanded the Morisco Revolt against Philip II of Spain in the Alpujarras region, near Granada.

==Early life==
Aben Humeya was born Fernando de Válor into a Morisco family and claimed to be of noble lineage, descended from the Umayyad dynasty. The name Aben Humeya is the Hispanicized version of the Arabic name &quot;Ibn Umayya&quot;, meaning &quot;Son of Umayya&quot; and hinting to a descent from the Umayyads.

Prior to the commencement of the Morisco revolt, Aben Humeya had been a town councilor of Granada and had been under house arrest for pulling out a dagger in the city council.

==The Morisco revolt (1568–1571)==
It is alleged that to provoke a rebellion which would give him a proper reason to expel the Moriscos of southern Spain, Philip II broke his promises previously made in treaties made with the Muslims and issued an edict requiring Moriscos to give up their Arabic names, their traditional Moorish dress, and even prohibited the speaking of Arabic. They were also told that they would have to give up their children to be educated by Christian priests.

The increasing persecution of the remaining Morisco population of the former Emirate of Granada, led to the outbreak of armed rebellion. The revolt was planned by Ferag ben Ferag, descended from the royal house of Granada and Diego López Ben Aboo. They carefully ascertained the dispositions of the inhabitants of the Alpujarras, where the best stand could be made against the royal forces, solicited aid from the kings of Morocco, and persuaded the local bandits to embrace their cause.

On Christmas Eve 1568, representatives of the Crypto-Muslims from Granada, from the Alpujarras, and from elsewhere clandestinely assembled at the Vale de Lecrin to acclaim de Valor as their king whom they renamed &quot;Aben Humeya&quot;, and apostatized. Aben Humeya also took four wives, hailing from many areas, in order to strengthen the political alliances on which he relied.

The insurrection led by Aben Humeya took the form of guerrilla warfare against the Castillan forces in the Alpujarra mountains. Initially numbering only about 4,000 men, the rebel forces quickly grew to about 25,000.

==Downfall and murder==
Diego Alguacil, a prominent Muslim from Ugíjar, was said to have harbored resentment against Aben Humeya for having forcibly abducted a widowed cousin and making her his mistress, when with her social status he should have taken her as his wife. Alguacil eventually married her in Tétouan six years later. In order to avenge his cousin&#x27;s honor, Alguacil began plotting Humeya&#x27;s downfall.

Aben Humeya had also long distrusted his Turkish and African allies, whom he removed from his camp to the frontier in Almeria and placed under the command of his cousin, Aben Aboo.

Alguacil began to play on the tensions that Humeya had reportedly had with the Turkish contingent of his army for quite some time. He went to the Turks and claimed that &quot;he had supplied Hashish to Aben Humeya in order that it be given to the Turkish captains so that they would be sedated and later, killed that night&quot;. The Turks refused the offer, explaining that the Turkish Caliphate had sent them &quot;not to become kings but to assist the king of the Moors.&quot; The captains suggested that the best course was, after securing approval from Algiers, to put power in the hands of a local man of noble descent in whom one might have confidence, someone who would serve the interests of the Muslims.

On 20 October 1569 Aben Humeya was strangled to death in a coup engineered by the Turkish military experts. Aben Aboo was proclaimed as Chief of the Moriscos under the name &quot;Mulley Abdalla&quot;. Aben Aboo was also eventually killed by his own men.

The deaths of Aben Humeya and Aben Aboo coupled with the arrival of 20,000 soldiers under the command of John of Austria, Philip&#x27;s illegitimate half-brother, to quash the rebellion, brought an end to over two years of vicious guerilla warfare in the Alpujarras. Almost the entire population of the Alpujarras was then deported to Castille or Kingdom of Seville and some 270 villages and hamlets were repopulated with settlers brought in from Northern Spain. The remaining villages were abandoned. This led to the destruction of the silk industry over the course of several centuries.

King Philip II had ordered the dispersal of 80,000 Moriscos of the Kingdom of Granada to other parts of Castile, expecting that this would fragment the Morisco community and accelerate their assimilation into the Christian population, although actually also had some influence on the local Moriscos who had until then become more assimilated. This eventually culminated with the overall Expulsion of the Moriscos.

<text>Henry Charles Keith Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne, (14 January 18453 June 1927), was a British statesman who served successively as Governor General of Canada, Viceroy of India, Secretary of State for War and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

In 1917, during the First World War, he wrote the &quot;Lansdowne letter&quot;, advocating in vain a compromise peace. A millionaire, he had the distinction of having held senior positions in Liberal and Conservative Party governments.
==Early years, 1845–1882==

A great-grandson of British Prime Minister Lord Shelburne (later 1st Marquess of Lansdowne) and the eldest son of Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 4th Marquess of Lansdowne, and his wife, Emily, 8th Lady Nairne (&quot;née&quot; de Flahaut), Henry Charles Keith Petty-Fitzmaurice was born in 1845 at Lansdowne House, their family seat in London. His maternal grandfather, Count Charles de Flahaut, was an important French general to Napoleon Bonaparte, and a member of his family. He fought along his side during many battles and later occupied the functions of Ambassador and Senator of the Empire. Through his mother Emily, Lansdowne was half-nephew of Emperor Napoleon III, a step-grandson of Queen Hortense Bonaparte, and a great-grandson of Prince Talleyrand, the Emperor&#x27;s foreign minister. His maternal great-grandfather, George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith, was also the Admiral who prevented Napoleon&#x27;s escape from France after the Battle of Waterloo, and who received and supervised his final surrender to St. Helena in 1815.

Lord Lansdowne was a member of the Fitzmaurice/Petty-Fitzmaurice family, a cadet branch of the House of FitzGerald of Ireland. He held the courtesy title &quot;Viscount Clanmaurice&quot; from birth to 1863 and then the courtesy title &quot;Earl of Kerry&quot; until he succeeded as &quot;Marquess of Lansdowne&quot; in 1866. Upon his mother&#x27;s death in 1895, he succeeded her as the 9th Lord Nairne in the Peerage of Scotland. He was estimated to be the sixteenth richest peer in the United Kingdom, and the fourth largest landowner.

After studying at Eton and Oxford, he succeeded his father as 5th Marquess of Lansdowne (in the Peerage of the United Kingdom) and 6th Earl of Kerry (in the Peerage of Ireland) at the relatively early age of 21 on 5 June 1866. He inherited a vast estate (including Bowood House, a Wiltshire estate of over 142,000 acres) and great wealth. At one of his inherited properties, Derreen House (Lauragh, County Kerry, in the present-day Republic of Ireland), Lord Lansdowne started to develop a great garden from 1871 onwards. For most of the rest of his life, he spent three months of the year at Derreen.

Lord Lansdowne entered the House of Lords as a member of the Liberal Party in 1866. He served in William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s government as a Lord of the Treasury from 1869 to 1872 and as Under-Secretary of State for War from 1872 to 1874. He was appointed Under-Secretary of State for India in 1880 and, having gained experience in overseas administration, was appointed Governor General of Canada in 1883, replacing John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll, the son-in-law of Queen Victoria. The present-day town of Lansdowne, in Uttarakhand, India, was established in 1887 and named after him.

He was a member and trustee of the Brooks&#x27;s Club in London, along notable members such as Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire of Chatsworth House, Lord Rosebery of Mentmore Towers, and Baron Lionel de Rothschild of Tring Park, son of Nathan Mayer of Gunnersbury Park, and grandson of Mayer Amschel, founder of the House of Rothschild. His great-grandfather, Lord Shelburne, had previously founded the Boodle&#x27;s Club, which had as members Adam Smith, the Duke of Wellington, Sir Winston Churchill, and Ian Fleming, among others, and is now the second oldest club in the world.

In 1897, he also became a founding trustee of the National Gallery of British Art, with the Earl of Carlisle of Castle Howard, Lord Brownlow of Belton House, Alfred de Rothschild of Halton House, Sir Charles Tennant of Glen House, John Postle Heseltine of Walhampton House, and Sir John Murray Scott.

==Governor General of Canada, 1883–1888==
Lord Lansdowne was Governor General during turbulent times in Canada. His Protestant Irish connections made him unpopular with the Catholic Irish element. He was appointed GCMG in January 1884.

Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald&#x27;s government was in its second term and facing allegations of scandal over the building of the railway (the Pacific Scandal), and the economy was once again sliding into recession. The North-West Rebellion of 1885 and the controversy caused by its leader, Louis Riel, posed a serious threat to the equilibrium of Canadian politics. To calm the situation, he travelled extensively throughout Western Canada in 1885 and met many of Canada&#x27;s First Nations peoples. He publicly objected to the treatment of the Indigenous by Indian Agents, and supported Chiefs Crowfoot and Poundmaker. His experiences in Western Canada gave Lansdowne a great love of the Canadian outdoors and the physical beauty of Canada. He was an avid fisherman and was intensely interested in winter sports. His love of the wilderness and the Canadian countryside led him to purchase a second residence (first Cascapedia House, built in 1880, later renamed Lorne Cottage, and then New Dereen Camp, built in 1884) on the Cascapédia River in the Gaspé Peninsula, Quebec. The same area was previously used by the past Viceroy of Canada, John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll, and his wife, Princess Louise, the daughter of Queen Victoria.

Lansdowne proved to be an adept statesman in helping to settle a dispute over fishing rights between Canada and the United States in 1886–1887. He successfully negotiated a new trade agreement with U.S. President Grover Cleveland (though it later failed to pass in the Senate). He was also a supporter of scientific development and presided over the inaugural session of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1884. In Quebec, he was very popular, as he spoke French fluently, which gained him the admiration of French-Canadians, and a big round of applause during his first speech. His French came from his maternal grandfather, Count Charles de Flahaut, who had been a French general to Napoleon Bonaparte. Lord Lansdowne also made multiple speeches at the Citadelle of Quebec, near Château Frontenac, and joined the Montreal Winter Carnival, making him and his wife, the first vice-royal couple to skate at that event.

Lansdowne departed Canada &quot;with its clear skies, its exhilarating sports, and within the bright fire of Gatineau logs, with our children and friends gathered round us&quot; to his regret. He gave his wife a great deal of the credit for his success in Canada. One of her happiest and most successful endeavours at Rideau Hall was a party that she threw for 400 Sunday school children. Lady Lansdowne was decorated with the Order of Victoria and Albert and the Imperial Order of the Crown of India. Lord Lansdowne&#x27;s military secretary, Lord Melgund, later became Lord Minto and served as Governor General between 1898 and 1904. Parc Lansdowne and Lansdowne Avenue in Westmount, Montreal, next to Westmount Park, was named in his honor, as well as Lansdowne Ridge and Upper-Lansdowne, both located on Westmount&#x27;s summit next to Villa Sainte-Marcelline and Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory.

==Viceroy of India, 1888–1894==
Lord Lansdowne was appointed Viceroy of India the same year that he left Canada. In December 1888 he was appointed GCSI and GCIE The office, which he held from 1888 to 1894, was offered to him by the Conservative prime minister, Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury of Hatfield House, and marked the pinnacle of his career. He worked to reform the army, police, local government and the mint. There was an Anglo-Manipur War in 1890 in which Manipur was subjugated. Lansdowne securing the death penalty for the instigator in the face of considerable opposition from Britain. His attempt in 1893 to curtail trial by jury was, however, overruled by home government. He returned to England in 1894. His policies exacerbated tensions between Hindu and Muslims.

==Secretary of State for War, 1895–1900==
Upon his return, as a Liberal Unionist, he aligned with the Conservative Party. Prime Minister Lord Salisbury appointed Lansdowne to the post of Secretary of State for War in June 1895. The unpreparedness of the British Army during the Second Boer War brought calls for Lansdowne&#x27;s impeachment in 1899. His biographer, P. B. Waite, considers that he was unjustly criticised for British military failures, but ever the good minister, he took full responsibility and said nothing.

==Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, 1900–1905==

After the Unionist victory in the general election of October 1900, Salisbury reorganised his cabinet, gave up the post of Foreign Secretary and appointed Lansdowne to replace him. Lansdowne remained at the Foreign Office under Salisbury&#x27;s successor Arthur Balfour. As British Foreign Secretary, he approved of protectorate Commissioner Wilson&#x27;s 1901 Anglo-Ankole agreement in Uganda, he also signed the 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance at his London home, the back half of which still exists as the Lansdowne Club, and negotiated the 1904 Anglo-French Entente Cordiale with French Foreign Minister Theophile Delcassé.
According to G. W. Monger&#x27;s summary of the Cabinet debates in 1900 to 1902:Chamberlain advocated ending Britain&#x27;s isolation by concluding an alliance with Germany; Salisbury resisted change. With the new crisis in China caused by the Boxer rising and Landsdowne&#x27;s appointment to the Foreign Office in 1900, those who advocated a change won the upper hand. Landsdowne in turn attempted to reach an agreement with Germany and a settlement with Russia but failed. In the end Britain concluded an alliance with Japan. The decision of 1901 was momentous; British policy had been guided by events, but Lansdowne had no real understanding of these events. The change of policy had been forced on him and was a confession of Britain&#x27;s weakness.

===Big Revolver===
On 15 June 1903, he made a speech in the House of Lords defending fiscal retaliation against countries with high tariffs and governments subsidising products for sale in Britain (known as &#x27;bounty-fed products&#x27;, also called dumping). Retaliation was to be done by threatening to impose tariffs in response against that country&#x27;s goods. His Liberal Unionists had split from the Liberals, who promoted Free Trade, and the speech was a landmark in the group&#x27;s slide towards protectionism. Landsdowne argued that threatening retaliatory tariffs was similar to getting respect in a room of armed men by showing a big revolver (his exact words were &quot;a rather larger revolver than everybody else&#x27;s&quot;). The &quot;Big Revolver&quot; became a catchphrase of the day and was often used in speeches and cartoons.

==Unionist leader in Lords==

In 1903, Lord Lansdowne became the leader of Unionists (Conservative and Liberal Unionist peers) in the House of Lords. This was followed shortly by the Liberal victory in the January 1906 general elections. In his new role as head of the opposition peers, he was instrumental in the Unionist leader Arthur Balfour&#x27;s plans to obstruct Liberal policies through the Unionist majority in the upper house. Although he and Balfour had some misgivings, he led the Lords to reject the People&#x27;s Budget of 1909. After the Liberals won two elections in 1910 on the pledge to reform the House of Lords and to remove its veto power and after a series of failed negotiations in which Lansdowne was of key importance, the Liberals moved forward to end the Lords veto, if necessary by recommending to the King to create hundreds of new Liberal peers. Lansdowne and the other Conservative leaders were anxious to prevent such an action by allowing the bill, distasteful as they found it, to pass, but soon, Lansdowne found that he could not count on many of the more reactionary peers, who planned on a last-ditch resistance. Ultimately, enough Unionist peers either (like Lansdowne himself) abstained from the vote (&quot;hedgers&quot;) or even voted for the bill (&quot;rats&quot;) to ensure its passage into the Parliament Act 1911.

In the following years, Lansdowne continued as Opposition Leader in the Lords, his stature increasing when Balfour, the party leader in the Commons, resigned and was replaced by the inexperienced Bonar Law, who had never held cabinet office. In 1914, the suffragettes Flora Drummond and Norah Dacre Fox (later known as Norah Elam) besieged Lansdowne&#x27;s home and argued that Ulster&#x27;s incitement to militancy had passed without notice, but suffragettes were charged and imprisoned. In 1915, Lansdowne joined the wartime coalition cabinet of H. H. Asquith as a Minister without Portfolio but was not given a post in the Lloyd George government formed the following year, despite Conservative pre-eminence in that government. In 1917, having discussed the idea with colleagues for some time with no response, he published the controversial &quot;Lansdowne letter&quot;, which called for a statement of postwar intentions from the Entente Powers, and an end to the war on the basis of a return to the status quo ante. He was criticised as acting contrary to cabinet policy.

== Death ==
Lord Lansdowne died at Clonmel, Ireland on 3 June 1927 at the age of 82. The probate on his estate was granted with the value sworn at in land and another £233,888 in other assets. His widow died in 1932, and their tombs are in the churchyard at Derry Hill, near their Bowood estate in Wiltshire.

<doc id="287404" wikidata="Q506638" url="?curid=287404" title="The Paradine Case">
<text>The Paradine Case is a 1947 courtroom drama with elements of film noir set in England, directed by Alfred Hitchcock and produced by David O. Selznick. Selznick and an uncredited Ben Hecht wrote the screenplay from an adaptation by Alma Reville and James Bridie of the 1933 novel by Robert Smythe Hichens. The film stars Gregory Peck, Ann Todd, Alida Valli, Charles Laughton, Charles Coburn, Ethel Barrymore, and Louis Jourdan. It tells of an English barrister who falls in love with a woman who is accused of murder, and how it affects his relationship with his wife.

==Plot==
In London, Maddalena Anna Paradine (Alida Valli) is a very beautiful and enigmatic young Italian woman who is accused of poisoning her older, blind husband, a wealthy retired colonel. It is not clear whether she is a grateful and devoted wife who has been falsely charged or a calculating and ruthless femme fatale.

Mrs. Paradine&#x27;s solicitor, Sir Simon Flaquer (Charles Coburn), hires Anthony Keane (Gregory Peck), a brilliant and successful barrister, to defend her in court. Although Keane has been happily married for eleven years, he instantly becomes deeply infatuated with his client. Keane&#x27;s wife, Gay (Ann Todd), sees his obsession, and although he offers to relinquish the case, presses him to continue. She knows that a &quot;guilty&quot; verdict, followed by Mrs. Paradine&#x27;s hanging, will mean that she will lose her husband emotionally forever. The only way that she can regain her husband&#x27;s love and devotion is if he is able to obtain a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict for Mrs. Paradine.

Meanwhile, Keane himself starts to focus his legal efforts on Colonel Paradine&#x27;s French-Canadian manservant, André Latour, DCM &amp; Bar (Louis Jourdan). Keane sees Latour as a scapegoat on whom he can pin the crime of murder, but this strategy backfires. After Keane repeatedly badgers Latour in court, triggering an angry outburst, word comes that Latour has killed himself.

Mrs. Paradine is coldly furious that (contrary to her express instructions) Keane has destroyed Latour, who was her lover. On the witness stand, she tells Keane that she hates him and that he has murdered the only person she loved. She goes so far as to say that she poisoned her husband in order to be with Latour.

Keane is overwhelmed. Attempting to summarize, he improvises a brief and faltering speech, admitting how poorly he has handled the case; unable to continue speaking, he has to leave the court. He stays overnight at Sir Simon&#x27;s office, knowing that his career is in ruins. Finding him there, his wife offers reconciliation and hope for the future.

;Cast notes
* It is reported that Hitchcock originally wanted Greta Garbo to play Mrs. Maddalena Anna Paradine, but she turned down the role after the screen test, which allowed Alida Valli to step in for her American film debut. However Hitchcock denied this in a 1972 interview on The Dick Cavett Show. &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; was also the American film debut of Louis Jourdan. Both Valli and Jourdan hoped that the film would give them the status in the U.S. that they enjoyed in their home countries (Italy and France, respectively), but that did not happen, though Jourdan later made many U.S. films.

==Production==
David O. Selznick had purchased the rights to Robert Smythe Hichens&#x27; novel in 1933, before it was published, when Selznick was still at MGM, with Greta Garbo in mind to star – indeed, Garbo was Hichens&#x27; inspiration for the creation of Mrs. Paradine. Garbo did consider doing the film, but ultimately turned it down. She had decided to retire from acting. (Garbo had also turned down &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; at about the same time, and is reputed to have said &quot;No murderesses, no mamas&quot;.)

Howard Estabrook was assigned to write the script at that time, and it was announced that John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore and Diana Wynyard would star in the film. A draft of the script was submitted by MGM to the censors at the Hays Office, who warned that the script would likely be rejected since Mrs. Paradine was guilty of murder, adultery and perjury, and later committed suicide. They also objected to the judge being portrayed as a sadist who enjoyed sending people to their deaths. A new draft of the script was submitted, but not for some years, in 1942, and this script was approved. In 1946, another version was sent in, and this was also approved after the suicide was removed from the story.

In 1946, it was announced that Alfred Hitchcock would direct the film, and that Laurence Olivier would star as the barrister, but Olivier eventually turned the project down, as he was preparing for his production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Hitchcock was interested in Ronald Colman for the part as well as Garbo (who had not yet turned down the project) or Ingrid Bergman for Mrs. Paradine. Other actors who were considered for the film include: Maurice Evans, Joseph Cotten, Alan Marshal, James Mason for Anthony Keane; Hedy Lamarr for Mrs. Paradine; Claude Rains for Lord Thomas Horfield; and Robert Newton for Mrs. Paradine&#x27;s lover. In the end, Hitchcock pushed for Gregory Peck, then at the peak of his box-office appeal; Ann Todd was borrowed from the Rank Organisation to play his wife; and Selznick settled on Alida Valli, considered one of the more promising actresses in the Italian cinema for Mrs. Paradine.

&quot;The Paradine Case&quot; was the last film made under Hitchcock&#x27;s seven-year contract with Selznick, as Hitchcock may have tired of the association by that time. In an interview with François Truffaut, Hitchcock said that he and his wife Alma Reville wrote the first draft of the script together, before bringing in Scottish playwright James Bridie to do some polishing, but that Selznick, dissatisfied with the result, would view the previous day&#x27;s rushes, do a rewrite, and send the new scenes to the set to be shot. According to his biographer Donald Spoto &quot;...Hitchcock&#x27;s disgust with the content and method that were forced upon him conspired to produce an uneasy atmosphere from which Hitchcock could scarcely wait to extricate himself.&quot; Gregory Peck said of the director, &quot;He seemed really bored with the whole thing...&quot;

The film was in production from December 19, 1946, to May 7, 1947, with retakes done in November of that year. Although some external shots show the Lake District in Cumbria, the rest of the footage was shot on three sets at Selznick&#x27;s lot in Culver City, California, a first in Selznick&#x27;s career as an independent producer. Selznick reportedly spared no expense. The set for the courtroom scenes exactly duplicated a courtroom in London&#x27;s Old Bailey, photographed, with permission, by unit manager Fred Ahern, and built in 85 days at the cost of $80,000. Unusually, the set had ceilings to allow for low camera angles.

For the courtroom sequence, Hitchcock used more than one camera, a technique which had been used in the past, but only to shoot the same subject. Here, Hitchcock used four cameras shooting simultaneously, each focused on one of the principal actors in the scene. This set-up, including elaborately choreographed crane shots, allowed Hitchcock to shoot longer takes of about ten minutes, something he would push to the limit on his next two films, &quot;Rope&quot; (1948) and &quot;Under Capricorn&quot; (1949).

The completed film cost an estimated $4,258,000 to make, almost as much as &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Selznick maintained close supervision on the production, and interfered with Hitchcock&#x27;s normally carefully budgeted process by demanding extensive re-takes. When Hitchcock insisted on receiving his contractual $1000/day fee, Selznick took over post-production, supervising the editing and the scoring of the film. The producer went through eighteen different title changes for the picture before rechristening it &quot;The Paradine Case,&quot; just hours before the premiere.

&quot;The Paradine Case&quot; opened December 29, 1947, in Los Angeles and in two theaters across the street from each other in Westwood, California followed by its New York City premiere on January 8, 1948. The film was initially 132 minutes long, Selznick having editing down Hitchcock&#x27;s rough cut of almost three hours. Before general release, however, Selznick further reduced the running time to 114 minutes, which is also the current length of the DVD release. In 1980, a flood reportedly destroyed the uncut original version of the film, making a restoration unlikely.

&quot;The Paradine Case&quot; was not a box office success, worldwide receipts barely covering half of the cost of production.

Hitchcock put in a cameo appearance in most of his films. In this film, he can be seen leaving the Cumberland train station, carrying a cello, at about 38 minutes.

Hitchcock described &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; as &quot;...a love story embedded in the emotional quicksand of a murder trial&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Bosley Crowther, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, liked the film, the acting, and Hitchcock&#x27;s direction, and wrote, &quot;With all the skill in presentation for which both gentlemen are famed, David O. Selznick and Alfred Hitchcock have put upon the screen a slick piece of static entertainment in their garrulous &quot;The Paradine Case&quot;... Gregory Peck is impressively impassioned as the famous young London barrister who lets his heart, cruelly captured by his client, rule his head. And Ann Todd, the pliant British actress, is attractively anguished as his wife. Alida Valli, an import from Italy, makes the caged Mrs. Paradine a compound of mystery, fascination and voluptuousness with a pair of bedroom eyes, and Louis Jourdan, a new boy from Paris, is electric as the badgered valet.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;high dramatics...Hitchcock&#x27;s penchant for suspense and unusual atmosphere development get full play. There is a deliberateness of pace, artful pauses and other carefully calculated melodramatic hinges upon which he swings the story and players. &quot;Time Out&quot; says &quot;Bleak in its message (those who love passionately inevitably destroy the object of their desire), the movie only half works. The intricate, triangular plot is finally overburdened by the courtroom setting.&quot;

Leonard Maltin said &quot;talk, talk, talk in complicated, stagy courtroom drama;&quot;

Despite the mixed reviews the movie received, most critics noted the strong performances of Ann Todd and Joan Tetzel.

==Awards and honors==
Ethel Barrymore was nominated for a 1947 Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as Lady Sophie Horfield.

==Adaptation==
&quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; broadcast a radio adaptation of the film on 9 May 1949, starring Joseph Cotten, with Alida Valli and Louis Jourdan reprising their roles.

<text>The Cemetery of the Evergreens, also called The Evergreens Cemetery, is a non-denominational rural cemetery along the Cemetery Belt in Brooklyn and Queens, New York City. It was incorporated in 1849, not long after the passage of New York&#x27;s Rural Cemetery Act spurred development of cemeteries outside Manhattan. For a time, it was the busiest cemetery in New York City; in 1929 there were 4,673 interments. Today, the Evergreens is the final resting place of more than 526,000 people.

The cemetery borders Brooklyn and Queens and covers of rolling hills and gently sloping meadows. It features several thousand trees and flowering shrubs in a park-like setting. Cypress Hills Cemetery lies to its northeast.

==History==
The Evergreens was built on the principle of the rural cemetery. Two of the era&#x27;s most noted landscape architects, Andrew Jackson Downing and Alexander Jackson Davis, were instrumental in the layout of the cemetery grounds.

The Evergreens has a monument to six victims of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of March 25, 1911 who were unidentified for nearly a century. In 2011, Michael Hirsch, a historian, completed four years of research that identified these victims by name (see ).

There are also seventeen British Commonwealth service personnel buried in the cemetery: thirteen from World War I and four from World War II.

The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 2007.

<doc id="287407" wikidata="Q235641" url="?curid=287407" title="Marie Trintignant">
<text>Marie Trintignant (; 21 January 1962 – 1 August 2003) was a French film and stage actress. She appeared in over 30 movies during her 36-year career. Her family was deeply involved in France&#x27;s film industry, as her father was an actor and her mother was a director, producer, and screenwriter.

In 2003, Trintignant began an affair with Bertrand Cantat, the lead singer of French rock band Noir Désir. That same year, Cantat, Trintignant, and Trintignant&#x27;s mother traveled to Lithuania so Trintignant and her mother could finish work on a television movie. On 26 July 2003, while in their shared hotel room, Cantat flew into a jealous rage during an argument over a text message sent to Trintignant by her husband, from whom she was separated; Cantat proceeded to beat Trintignant severely about the head and face. She died days later from cerebral edema brought about by her injuries. Cantat was convicted of &quot;murder with indirect intent&quot; in her death and received an eight-year prison sentence, of which he served four before his early release. Trintignant&#x27;s case became a cause célèbre in the discussion of domestic violence and leniency towards perpetrators.

==Early life==
Trintignant was born in Boulogne-Billancourt, the daughter of actor Jean-Louis Trintignant and his second wife, French film director, producer, and screenwriter Nadine Marquand. When Marie&#x27;s baby sister Pauline died when Marie was nine, she became withdrawn and virtually stopped speaking. Her parents divorced in 1976. Throughout her early life, she was afflicted by severe shyness, but by her mid-teens, she decided to commit to acting. She had a strong affection for animals and considered becoming a veterinarian, but in the end pursued a career in acting.

== Career ==
She first appeared on screen aged four in &quot;My Love, My Love&quot;, which was directed by her mother and starred her father. Trintignant&#x27;s first film to generate significant critical acclaim was &quot;Série noire&quot;, in which she starred alongside Patrick Dewaere.

In 1988, Trintignant worked under French director Claude Chabrol in the film &quot;Une Affaire de Femmes&quot;, in which she played a young prostitute in wartime Vichy France. Of the role and Chabrol&#x27;s impact on her career, Trintignant later reflected, &quot;Until then, I had always felt that I was a fraud if I did not go to extremes in showing my characters&#x27; pain, but he taught me lightness. He showed me how to grow without false tragedy.&quot; She worked with Chabrol again in 1991 on the film &quot;Betty&quot;, an adaptation of a book by Georges Simenon.

In 1990, Trintignant was involved in a serious car accident which she narrowly survived. The accident hardly impacted the pace of her career, and she starred in 21 films afterwards, including &quot;Les Amants du Pont-Neuf&quot; in 1991 and &quot;Wild Target&quot; in 1993, starring alongside Jean Rochefort and Guillaume Depardieu. She starred opposite her then-husband François Cluzet in the 1995 film &quot;The Apprentices&quot;, and in 1998, she appeared again with Depardieu in &quot;White Lies&quot;. Two of Trintignant&#x27;s films were released posthumously: &quot;Janis et John&quot;, a biographical film directed by her estranged husband Samuel Benchetrit, in which Trintignant starred as Janis Joplin, and &quot;Colette, une femme libre&quot;, a biographical miniseries in which Trintignant played the lead role of French novelist Colette.

Trintignant stated that she enjoyed portraying marginalized women and tragic heroes on film; she enjoyed playing characters who allowed her to speak &quot;for those who don&#x27;t deserve being spoken for.&quot; She performed in both comedies and tragedies.

==Personal life==
Trintignant was the mother of four sons:

* Roman, with drummer 
* Paul, with actor and former husband François Cluzet
* Léon, with Mathias Othnin-Girard
* Jules, with her husband director Samuel Benchetrit

Trintignant was still married to Benchetrit at the time of her death, although the two had separated earlier in 2003.

Two of Trintignant&#x27;s sons, and , are actors.

==Death==

In 2003, Trintignant traveled to Vilnius, Lithuania, with her mother and her boyfriend, Bertrand Cantat, so she and her mother could finish work on &quot;Colette, une femme libre&quot;, a television movie in which Trintignant played the starring role. On 26 July, Trintignant was in a hotel room in Vilnius when, according to Cantat, Trintignant received a text from her husband. Cantat flew into a jealous rage, and he beat Trintignant severely. Seven hours later, Trintignant&#x27;s brother summoned emergency services to check the hotel room. When they arrived, Trintignant had slipped into a deep coma. She was transported to a hospital in Vilnius the next day; later, she was moved to the Hartmann Clinic, a hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, as her mother stated, &quot;If she is to die, I want her to die in France.&quot; Trintignant died in Neuilly from swelling of the brain at the age of 41 on 1 August 2003.

=== Aftermath ===

When authorities first arrived at the hotel room, Cantat told them and Trintignant&#x27;s parents that Trintignant had fallen backwards during their argument and hit her head against a wall. An autopsy revealed that Cantat actually struck Trintignant in the head and face at least 19 times. After the autopsy countered Cantat&#x27;s version of events, Cantat would only admit to having &quot;slapped&quot; Trintignant four times and then putting her to bed while not knowing that she had incurred severe and irreversible brain damage due to the assault.

Although Cantat attempted to argue in court that he should be convicted of manslaughter, he was convicted of the slightly more severe &quot;murder with indirect intent&quot; and sentenced to eight years in prison. At the request of his lawyers, Cantat was moved from the Lithuanian Lukiškės prison, to a prison near Muret, France, in September 2004.
He was released on parole after serving four years of his sentence. Cantat&#x27;s parole drew widespread criticism from women&#x27;s rights activists and Trintignant&#x27;s parents, who had failed to persuade French President Nicolas Sarkozy and French judges to block Cantat&#x27;s conditional release.

Several writers criticized the media for sensationalizing Trintignant&#x27;s death and her relationship with Cantat, as, despite the elements of domestic violence in their relationship, rock journalists frequently compared them to Romeo and Juliet, as well as Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen.

Trintignant&#x27;s death resurfaced in the media years after Cantat&#x27;s release when, in 2010, Cantat&#x27;s ex-wife Krisztina Rády died by suicide. Cantat was present at Rády&#x27;s house at the time of her death. Before her death, Rády had complained that Cantat subjected her to physical and mental abuse. Magistrates in Bordeaux conducted an investigation against Cantat to adjudge if he should be charged for culpability in Rády&#x27;s death, but ultimately, they decided against pressing charges.

Marie Trintignant has been the subject of several documentaries, including &quot;Enquete Exclusive – Affaire Bertrand Cantat&quot; (2019) and &quot;Marie Trintignant: Tes rêves brisés&quot; (2022). The former deals with her death and Cantat&#x27;s subsequent trial; it also shows, for the first time on French television, images of Bertrand Cantat&#x27;s hearing before the Lithuanian court. The latter, which was directed by Trintignant&#x27;s mother, recalls her life.

* &quot;Comme elle respire&quot; - 1999 (best actress)
* &quot;Le Cousin&quot; - 1998 (best supporting actress)

<text>, usually cited as Sin-Itiro Tomonaga in English, was a Japanese physicist, influential in the development of quantum electrodynamics, work for which he was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 along with Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger.

==Biography==
Tomonaga was born in Tokyo in 1906. He was the second child and eldest son of a Japanese philosopher, Tomonaga Sanjūrō. He entered the Kyoto Imperial University in 1926. Hideki Yukawa, also a Nobel laureate, was one of his classmates during undergraduate school. During graduate school at the same university, he worked as an assistant in the university for three years. In 1931, after graduate school, he joined Nishina&#x27;s group in RIKEN. In 1937, while working at Leipzig University (Leipzig), he collaborated with the research group of Werner Heisenberg. Two years later, he returned to Japan due to the outbreak of the Second World War, but finished his doctoral degree (Dissertation PhD from University of Tokyo) on the study of nuclear materials with his thesis on work he had done while in Leipzig.

In Japan, he was appointed to a professorship in the Tokyo University of Education (a forerunner of Tsukuba University). During the war he studied the magnetron, meson theory, and his super-many-time theory. In 1948, he and his students re-examined a 1939 paper by Sidney Dancoff that attempted, but failed, to show that the infinite quantities that arise in quantum electrodynamics (QED) can be canceled with each other. Tomonaga applied his super-many-time theory and a relativistic method based on the non-relativistic method of Wolfgang Pauli and Fierz to greatly speed up and clarify the calculations. Then he and his students found that Dancoff had overlooked one term in the perturbation series. With this term, the theory gave finite results; thus Tomonaga discovered the renormalization method independently of Julian Schwinger and calculated physical quantities such as the Lamb shift at the same time.

In 1949, he was invited by Robert Oppenheimer to work at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He studied a many-body problem on the collective oscillations of a quantum-mechanical system. In the following year, he returned to Japan and proposed the Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid. In 1955, he took the leadership in establishing the Institute for Nuclear Study, University of Tokyo. In 1965, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, with Julian Schwinger and Richard P. Feynman, for the study of QED, specifically for the discovery of the renormalization method. He died of throat cancer in Tokyo in 1979.

Tomonaga was married in 1940 to Ryōko Sekiguchi. They had two sons and one daughter. He was awarded the Order of Culture in 1952, and the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun in 1976.

In recognition of three Nobel laureates&#x27; contributions, the bronze statues of Shin&#x27;ichirō Tomonaga, Leo Esaki, and Makoto Kobayashi was set up in the Central Park of Azuma 2 in Tsukuba City in 2015.

<doc id="287415" wikidata="Q2151874" url="?curid=287415" title="Rideau Hall">
<text>Rideau Hall (officially Government House) is the official residence of the governor general of Canada, the representative of the monarch of Canada. Located in Ottawa, the capital of the country on a estate at 1 Sussex Drive. The main building consisting of approximately 175 rooms across , and 27 outbuildings around the grounds. Rideau Hall&#x27;s site lies just outside the centre of Ottawa. It is one of two official vice-regal residences maintained by the federal Crown, the other being the Citadelle of Quebec.

Most of Rideau Hall is used for state affairs, only of its area being dedicated to private living quarters, while additional areas serve as the offices of the Canadian Heraldic Authority and the principal workplace of the governor general and their staff; either the term &quot;Rideau Hall&quot;, as a metonym, or the formal idiom &quot;Government House&quot; is employed to refer to this bureaucratic branch. Officially received at the palace are foreign heads of state, both incoming and outgoing ambassadors and high commissioners to Canada, and Canadian Crown ministers for audiences with either the viceroy or the sovereign, should the latter be in residence. Rideau Hall is likewise the location of many Canadian award presentations and investitures, where prime ministers and other members of the federal Cabinet are sworn in, and where federal writs of election are &quot;dropped&quot;, among other ceremonial and constitutional functions.

Rideau Hall and the surrounding grounds were designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1977. The house is open to the public for guided tours throughout the year; approximately 200,000 visitors tour Rideau Hall annually. Since 1934, the Federal District Commission (now the National Capital Commission) has managed the grounds.

==Name==
The name &quot;Rideau Hall&quot; was chosen by Thomas McKay for his villa, drawing inspiration from the Rideau Canal which he had helped construct, though the house was also known colloquially as &quot;McKay&#x27;s Castle&quot;. Once the house became the official residence of the governor general, it was termed formally as &quot;Government House&quot;. However, Rideau Hall stuck as the informal name, and the existence of two names for the building led to some issue: in 1889 the viceregal consort, the Lady Stanley of Preston, was rebuked by Queen Victoria for calling the house Rideau Hall; it was to be Government House, as in all other Empire capitals. Today, however, Rideau Hall is the commonly accepted term for the house, with Government House remaining only in use for very formal or legal affairs; for example, royal proclamations will finish with the phrase: &quot;At Our Government House, in Our City of Ottawa [...]&quot;

==History==
===McKay villa===

The site of Rideau Hall and the original structure were chosen and built by stonemason Thomas McKay, who immigrated from Perth, Scotland, to Montreal, Lower Canada, in 1817 and later became the main contractor involved in the construction of the Rideau Canal. Following the completion of the canal, McKay built mills at Rideau Falls, making him the founder of New Edinburgh, the original settlement of Ottawa. With his newly acquired wealth, McKay purchased the 100 acre site overlooking both the Ottawa and Rideau Rivers and built a stone villa where he and his family lived until 1855 and which became the root of the present day Rideau Hall. Locals referred to the structure as &quot;McKay&#x27;s Castle&quot;.

Even before the building became a viceregal residence, the hall received noted visitors, including three Governors General of the Province of Canada: the Lord Sydenham, the Earl of Elgin, and Sir Edmund Head. It was said that the watercolours of Barrack Hill (now Parliament Hill) painted by the latter governor&#x27;s wife, Lady Head, while she was visiting Rideau Hall, had influenced Queen Victoria to choose Bytown (now Ottawa) as the national capital. Also, on 2 September 1860, the day after he laid the cornerstone of the parliament buildings, Prince Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), drove through the grounds of Rideau Hall as part of his tour of the region.

===Viceregal home===

After Bytown was chosen as the capital of the Province of Canada, a design competition was launched in 1859 for a new parliamentary campus. The Centre Block, departmental buildings, and a residence for the governor general were each awarded separately. The winning scheme for Government House was a Second Empire design by Toronto architects Cumberland &amp; Storm. However, it was never built, owing to cost overruns on the construction of the parliament buildings.

In 1864, Rideau Hall was leased by the Crown from the McKay family for $4,000 per year and was intended to serve only as a temporary home for the viceroy until a proper government house could be constructed. The next year, Frederick Preston Rubidge oversaw the refinishing of the original villa and designed additions to accommodate the new functions. It was enlarged to three or four times the original size, mostly by way of a new 49-room wing, and, once complete, the first Governor General of Canada, the Viscount Monck, took residence. These additions were opposed by George Brown, who claimed that &quot;the governor general&#x27;s residence is a miserable little house, and the grounds those of an ambitious country squire.&quot; Prime Minister John A. Macdonald agreed, complaining that more had been spent on patching up Rideau Hall than could have been used to construct a new royal palace. Nonetheless, the gatehouse was enhanced by Rubidge and the entire property purchased outright in 1868 for the sum of $82,000.

Thereafter, the house became the social centre of Ottawa—even Canada—hosting foreign visitors (the first being Grand Duke Alexis, son of Emperor Alexander II of Russia), investitures, swearing-in ceremonies, balls, dinners, garden parties, children&#x27;s parties, and theatrical productions in the ballroom (initiated by the Earl and Countess of Dufferin), in which members of the household and viceregal family would participate. Probably the largest event held in the ballroom was a fancy dress ball hosted by the Dufferins on the evening of 23 February 1876, which approximately 1,500 guests attended.

Still, despite the popularity of the events that took place in the building, negative first impressions of Rideau Hall itself were a theme until the early part of the 20th century. Upon arrival there in 1872, the Countess of Dufferin said in her journal: &quot;We have been so very enthusiastic about everything hitherto that the first sight of Rideau Hall did lower our spirits just a little!&quot; In 1893, Lady Stanley, wife of Governor General the Lord Stanley of Preston, said &quot;you will find the furniture in the rooms very old-fashioned &amp; not very pretty [...] The red drawing room [...] had no furniture except chairs &amp; tables [...] The walls are absolutely bare [...] The room which has always been the wife of the G.G.&#x27;s sitting room is very empty [...] There are no lamps in the house at all. No cushions, no table cloths, in fact none of the small things that make a room pretty &amp; comfortable.&quot; Echoing these earlier comments, the Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair said upon her departure from Ottawa that Rideau Hall was a &quot;shabby old Government House put away amongst its clump of bushes [...]&quot;
Various improvements were undertaken over the decades, seeing the first gas chandeliers and a telegraph wire put in, as well as the construction of the ballroom in the same year. By the time Rideau Hall was to live up to its role as a royal home, when its first royal residents—John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, and his wife, Princess Louise—moved in at the beginning of 1878, many upgrades had been completed. Lorne stated of the hall: &quot;Here we are settling down in this big and comfortable House, which I tell Louise is much superior to Kensington, for the walls are thick, the rooms are lathed and plastered (which they are not at Kensington) and there is an abundant supply of heat and light.&quot; The princess was not long in Rideau Hall before Fenians posed themselves as a threat to her life and she was ushered back to the UK for both rest and protection. When she returned in 1880, with the Queen greatly concerned for her daughter&#x27;s safety, it was felt necessary to post extra guards around the grounds of the hall.

Thereafter, members of the royal family would stay periodically at Rideau Hall, if not as governor general then as guests of 
the Crown, so that the palace played host to Prince Leopold (later also Duke of Albany) in 1880; Prince George (later King George V) in 1882, 1901, and 1908; Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, and Princess Louise, Duchess of Connaught (later also the Duke and Duchess of Strathearn), in 1890 and as the viceregal couple from 1906 to 1912; Princess Louise in 1900; Princess Patricia with her parents from 1906 to 1912; Prince Albert (later King George VI) in 1910 and 1913; Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), in 1919, 1923, 1924, and 1927; Prince George (later also Duke of Kent) in 1926 and 1927; and Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, in 1929.

A member of the royal family, the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (grandson of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn), lost his life on the grounds of Rideau hall. Theo Aronson, in his 1981 biography of Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, simply stated that the Duke &quot;was found dead on the floor of his room at Rideau Hall on the morning of 26 April 1943. He had died, apparently, from hypothermia.&quot; The diaries of Sir Alan Lascelles, King George VI&#x27;s private secretary, published in 2006, recorded that both the regiment and Athlone had rejected him as incompetent, and he fell out of a window when drunk and perished of hypothermia overnight.

===Second World War===
When King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, arrived at Rideau Hall on 19 May 1939, during their first royal tour of Canada, official royal tour historian Gustave Lanctot stated: &quot;When Their Majesties walked into their Canadian residence, the Statute of Westminster had assumed full reality: the King of Canada had come home.&quot; The King, while there, became the first monarch of Canada to personally receive the credentials of an ambassador, that being Daniel Calhoun Roper as the representative of the United States. It was thought for a time, after the outbreak of the Second World War, that the King, Queen, and their two daughters—Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret—would move permanently to Canada for the duration of the conflict in Europe; though, Hatley Castle, in Colwood, British Columbia, was purchased by the King in Right of Canada for this purpose, instead of using Rideau Hall. However, it was decided that the royal family leaving the United Kingdom at a time of war would be a major blow to morale and they remained in Britain.

During the war, the palace became the home in exile of a number of royals displaced by the invasions of their respective countries back in Europe. Among the royal guests were Crown Prince Olav (later King Olav V) and Crown Princess Märtha of Norway; Grand Duchess Charlotte and Prince Felix of Luxembourg; King Peter II of Yugoslavia; King George II of Greece; Empress Zita of Austria and her daughters; as well as Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, her daughter, Princess Juliana (later Queen Juliana), and granddaughters, Princesses Beatrix (later Queen Beatrix), Irene, and Margriet. Though the resident governor general&#x27;s wife, Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, could do little to add her personal touch to Rideau Hall, due to rationing and scarce supplies, she put many of the other royal ladies to work making clothing for those who had lost their homes in the Blitz. It was then in 1940 that the governor general&#x27;s office in the East Block of Parliament Hill was closed and moved to Rideau Hall. In December 1941, Winston Churchill arrived at the hall, where he presided over British Cabinet meetings via telephone from his bed.

===Postwar and closed gates===

At the end of the global war, the first peacetime ball at Rideau Hall was held for President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower, after which life within the household returned to normal. The transition from war to peace was marked by the appointment as governor general of the Viscount Alexander, whose son, Brian, reportedly used the portraits of former governors general throughout the hall as targets for his water pistol. During Alexander&#x27;s tenure, Government House&#x27;s first post-war Canadian royal visitors were the heiress presumptive to the throne, Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (later Queen Elizabeth II), and her husband, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who came in late 1951 and, amongst other activities, took part in a square dance in the ballroom (replete with checked shirts). Churchill, once again Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, returned to Rideau Hall in January of the next year, where, sprawled on a sofa with a cigar in one hand and a brandy in the other, he persuaded Alexander to join the British Cabinet.

With the death of the King only a month following Churchill&#x27;s 1952 visit, the front of Rideau Hall was covered with black bunting as a sign of mourning. As one of his last acts as king of Canada, George VI appointed Vincent Massey as not only the first Canadian-born viceregal resident of his Canadian home, but also the first who was single, with Massey having been widowed two years prior to his installation; his daughter-in-law, Lilias, thus acted as Chatelaine of Rideau Hall. Massey spoke of Rideau Hall as &quot;a piece of architecture that might be regarded as possessing a certain lovable eccentricity,&quot; in spite of &quot;some of the most regrettable pieces of furniture I have ever seen.&quot;

The number of formal occasions at Rideau Hall increased through the 1950s and 1960s, as Canada&#x27;s diplomatic corps increased and the country gained greater international standing; visitors during Massey&#x27;s tenure included Queen Juliana, President Eisenhower, Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, Jawaharlal Nehru, and the presidents of Germany, Italy, and Indonesia. With the greater ease of travel, more members of Canada&#x27;s royal family visited as well, including the Queen Mother; Princess Mary, Princess Royal; Katharine, Duchess of Kent; Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon; Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; and, in 1957, Elizabeth was again in residence, though for the first time as queen. It was during that stay that the Queen made her first-ever appearance on live television; from Rideau Hall, on 13 October (Thanksgiving Day), she delivered an address to Canadians, aired on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The Queen also stayed in her Ottawa government house and held audience with an influx of 53 foreign heads of state and government during Expo 67, held in Montreal, and Canada&#x27;s centennial celebrations.

During the October Crisis in 1970, Rideau Hall was heavily guarded for a number of weeks, due to the threat from the &quot;Front de libération du Québec&quot;, who had planted bombs and conducted kidnappings in Quebec during the crisis. 
The relatively free access to the grounds, which had been traditionally allowed since 1921 and enjoyed by tourists and local neighbours alike, ceased during Jeanne Sauvé&#x27;s time as governor general from 1984 to 1990; access was granted only through invitation, appointment, or pre-arranged tours on certain days. The decision to do so was based on concerns expressed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the National Capital Commission for the security of the vicereine and brought Rideau Hall in line with other official residences, including 24 Sussex Drive and Buckingham Palace, that did not allow public access. However, Sauvé was reported to have also been personally concerned for her safety, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m worried about those crazy men out there.&quot;

This caused controversy not only because Sauvé had contradicted her earlier statement about Rideau Hall, wherein she said: &quot;oh yes, definitely, it has to be open,&quot; but also because it denied Ottawa residents the use of the grounds. One group formed under the name &quot;Canada Unlock the Gate Group&quot; and asserted the closure was more due to Sauvé&#x27;s selfish desire for privacy than any real security risks; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported in 1986 that the group planned to boycott the Governor General&#x27;s annual garden party because of what they called her &quot;bunker mentality&quot;. Sauvé&#x27;s successor, Ray Hnatyshyn, reopened Government House and its gardens to the public. Sauvé also entertained a plan suggested by management consultants Price Waterhouse to move from Rideau Hall into Rideau Cottage, both for privacy and cost savings.

===21st century===
Julie Payette did not take up residence in Rideau Hall during her tenure since, at the time of her appointment in October 2017, renovations that are part of a long-term plan toward 2067 were underway. In particular, the private apartments of the palace were being altered to provide a &quot;sense of privacy and intimacy&quot;. Payette instead moved into 7 Rideau Gate, the residence, immediately outside the main entrance to the Rideau Hall grounds, normally reserved for dignitaries on official visits to Canada. Though the alterations to the viceregal family suite were complete by March 2018, further renovations to improve accessibility began immediately after. There was an intent for Payette to move to Rideau Hall in the summer of 2019, but she spent the summer at the Citadelle of Quebec.

The grounds were again closed through much of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During that period, on 2 July, a former Canadian soldier and businessman from Bowsman, Manitoba, drove his truck through Thomas Gate, a pedestrian entrance in the fence surrounding the park. He continued in his vehicle approximately 120 metres along the path beyond before proceeding further on foot, hiding in the rose garden for a few minutes and then moving on towards the greenhouses behind Rideau Hall itself. Groundskeepers noticed the intruder and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were eventually called. The man, who the police noted was armed, was arrested without incident. Neither the Governor General nor the Prime Minister, who is using Rideau Cottage as a temporary residence while 24 Sussex Drive is under renovation, were on the Rideau Hall property at the time. According to a preliminary investigation by the RCMP, the man intended to have the Prime Minister &quot;arrested&quot; for recent policy decisions.

==Function==
Rideau Hall&#x27;s main purpose is to house the governor general of Canada and his or her offices, including the Canadian Heraldic Authority. It is also the residence of Canada&#x27;s monarch when he is in Ottawa. and has a royal and viceregal household to support the sovereign and governor general, comprising a maître d’hôtel, chefs, footmen, valets, dressers, pages, aides-de-camp (drawn from the junior officers of the Canadian Armed Forces), equerries, and others.

The majority of Rideau Hall&#x27;s area is dedicated to affairs of state; only 500 m2 (5,400 sq ft) of the total 9,500 m2 (102,000 sq ft) given to private living quarters. Some 200 events are held at Rideau Hall every year, most being Canadian award presentations and investitures. In this way, the palace is where prime ministers and other members of the federal Cabinet are sworn-in and federal writs of election are dropped, among other constitutional functions of the governor general. Heads of state and government, both incoming and outgoing ambassadors and high commissioners to Canada, and Canadian Crown ministers and loyal opposition leaders are received at Rideau Hall for audiences with either the viceroy or the sovereign, should the latter be in residence.

Although there is a state dining room in Rideau Hall, state dinners and luncheons are usually held in the larger ballroom or tent room. In setting up for a formal meal, a measuring stick is used to set the tableware and locate the charis relative to the tables uniformly. The ingredients and wines are &quot;100 per cent Canadian [...] reflecting Canada&#x27;s many cultures.&quot;

The residence is also open to the public, running a visitors&#x27; program and free tours of the state rooms throughout the year, as well as educational tours for students; it is the only one of the six official residences in the National Capital Region that is publicly accessible. A visitors&#x27; centre is on the grounds, adjacent to the main gate. Rideau Hall takes part annually in Doors Open Ottawa and children may trick-or-treat at the house each Hallowe&#x27;en.

==Architecture==
The original 1838 structure was relatively small; only two storeys tall with a full-height, central, curved bay, and an accordingly curved pediment on top, the villa was designed by Thomas McKay (who had also designed and built Earnscliffe) in a Regency style, inspired by the work of architect Sir John Soane, who had himself designed a never-realised government house for the then capital of Upper Canada, York, in 1818. Unlike the present arrangement, the rooms of the McKay villa for entertaining, sleeping, and service were dispersed throughout the two floors of the structure, with the main parlour on the second level, in an oval room behind the curved, south bay, which National Capital Commission Chief Architect David Scarlett said in 2014 was made in such a shape so as to display the advanced abilities of McKay&#x27;s stonemasons. The main entrance to the house was on the west side and opened into a hall with stairs to the upper floor directly ahead. Along the south front were a library, a dining room, and a boudoir, all with French doors opening onto a narrow balcony; the dining room was served by three of these doors, one of which now opens into the tent room&#x27;s antechamber, one into the long gallery, and one that still opens to the outside. The French door originally opening from the boudoir is today the window of the Pauline Vanier room.
Initially rented from the McKay family as a temporary accommodation for the Canadian viceroy, the house has since been expanded numerous times. The Viscount Monck oversaw the first addition to the villa in 1865: a long wing extending to the east and built in a style that, while attempting to be harmonious with the original, was intended to resemble the governor general&#x27;s residence in Quebec, Spencer Wood, which Monck greatly preferred over Rideau Hall. The extension was thus done in an overall Norman style of design that was typical in Quebec at the time, and had a similar long, covered verandah, a cross hall, and a new staircase capped by an ornate stained glass lantern. The exterior walls were clad in ashlar limestone masonry and the roof in cedar shingles until replaced by copper in 1913.

In 1872, during the tenure of the Earl of Dufferin, the indoor Tennis Court and the ballroom were added to the western end of the house, arranged to the south and north, respectively, of the main entrance. The ballroom is a structure of heavy timber framing with brick infill and finished stone exterior. Then, when the Earl of Minto arrived in 1898 with his large family and household, the Minto wing was constructed on the east end of Rideau Hall and was completed in the following year, though this was again intended to only be a temporary measure until a proper government house could be built. Minto&#x27;s successor, the Earl Grey, added the governor general&#x27;s study to the far east end of the Monck wing, thus symmetrically balancing out the curved bay and pediment of the original McKay villa to the west.
One of the greatest alterations to the form of Rideau Hall came in 1913, with the construction of the Mappin block as a link between the ballroom and what was then the tennis court (today the tent room), as well as to disguise the misalignment between those two structures. As such, Chief Dominion Architect David Ewart designed the Mappin block in an &quot;adapted Florentine architectural style&quot;, using limestone ashlar, and extended that over the flanking wings by re-facing them and harmonizing their window and cornice heights.

The Mappin block itself is three storeys in height, and its front is divided by pilasters into five bays, with the central one slightly wider than the equal other four. The windows on the main floor are each surrounded by smaller pilasters beneath a triangular pediment formed by keel moulding geisons, while the second level windows are each simply framed by astragal moulding broken at the top by a keystone. A heavy entablature separates the second and third levels, atop which sits less pronounced pilasters and simply framed windows, with the entire facade capped by a narrow cornice and a pediment with a tympanum that bears a bas relief of the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom (believed to be the largest rendition in the Commonwealth).
Rideau Hall&#x27;s main entrance is part of the Mappin block. To honour Queen Elizabeth II, the doorway was, on 1 July 2017 (the sesquicentennial of Confederation, in the 65th year of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign), named the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Entrance&quot; by Governor General David Johnston in a ceremony attended by Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. The bronze grilles on the doors are formed into a geometric pattern meant to represent infrastructure associated with settlement, including the Canadian Pacific Railway, while circular etching on the glass panels evokes indigenous cultures and the vertical lines echo paintings by Tom Thomson. The exterior handles are each fashioned from paired bronze dowels with elements, attached at top and bottom, formed from the same metal to appear as twigs. Inside, the push-plates, also of bronze, each have one of the supporters from the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada carved into them. Affixed to the exterior wall next to the entrance is a plaque made of forged and carved bronze shaped to appear as seven short, vertical planks of driftwood joined by a horizontal scroll in polished brass, bearing the words &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Entrance / Entrée de la reine&quot;, under the crowned royal cypher of Elizabeth II. These pieces, along with the grilles, were made by artist and blacksmith Cairn Cunnane.

For formal arrivals at the main door, this addition also included a porte-cochère with three arched openings between columns resting on the foundations of posts that supported the McKay villa&#x27;s porte-cochère. The centre opening is topped with a carved stone rendition of the shield of the Royal Arms of Canada as it appeared between 1868 and 1870. All the arches can be fitted during the winter with fanlights and glass doors to provide an enclosed space in which to exit cars.

On the third floor of the Mappin block is the apartment for aides-de-camp. It is from the kitchen within that apartment that the flagpole can be reached via a ladder and an attic space.

Further projects that were completed by 1914 were the enargement in 1912 of the state dining room and addition of the long gallery to the east of the tent room. Off the long gallery is the verandah, added in 1927. It is a simple, stucco-clad structure containing one room with large windows and French doors overlooking the upper terrace lawn in the corner between the Dufferin and Monck wings. Between the windows are half-round and flat classical pilasters. A set of stairs leads from the French doors to the upper terrace.
An accessible entrance—opened by Anne, Princess Royal, and named after her—was added in 1982 and the Minto wing was eventually converted from residences to offices. Then, at the prompting of Governor General Michaëlle Jean, the main facade of Rideau Hall underwent a major renovation through 2006 and 2007, overseen by the National Capital Commission, which has been responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the building and its grounds since 1986. Masonry was treated and restored, the original sash windows rehabilitated and stripped of their lead paint, and the copper roof of the Mappin wing was repaired. This was the first time any considerable work had been done on the front façade since the 1960s. A project began in 2012 to replace the building&#x27;s climate control system—consisting of three large external chillers and multiple window-mounted air conditioners—with a geothermal heating and cooling system, expected to supply approximately half of the building&#x27;s heating requirements during winter, until the geothermal system is expanded in future.

The hall was designated as a classified heritage property by the Federal Heritage Buildings Review Office in 1986, giving it the highest heritage significance in Canada.

==Decor and furnishings==
Rideau Hall has long been a collection point for Canadian art and cabinetry. As early as the first viceregal inhabitants, the hall has held pieces by prominent Canadian cabinet makers, such as Jaques &amp; Hay of Toronto, James Thompson of Montreal, and William Drum of Quebec. Originally, the interior decoration was heavily Victorian, with many Rococo influences. Renovations, however, have turned the interiors into predominantly Georgian spaces, with Adam and Palladian elements. Until the 1960s, the contents and colours of the house changed with each successive royal and viceregal family; the consort typically seeing it as her duty to update Rideau Hall to suit both her personal and contemporary tastes.
Today the rooms are furnished both with elements from the history of the residence as well as art and other objects that showcase contemporary Canadian culture. The long gallery&#x27;s Chinoiserie decoration was restored in 1993 at the direction of Gerda Hnatyshyn, wife of Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn, putting back much of the furniture and artifacts that had been collected by the Machioness of Willingdon throughout her tour of China in 1926. The space, used to greet and host functions for ambassadors and high commissioners to Canada, now contains five carpets donated by the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and a Steinway &amp; Sons baby grand piano that belonged to Glenn Gould. Other consorts left their mark on Rideau Hall, such as Princess Louise&#x27;s painted apple branches on a 6-panel Georgian door (into the room adjacent to the Pauline Vanier room) in the first-floor corridor and Nora Michener&#x27;s donated collection of Inuit sculpture. Governor General Adrienne Clarkson and her husband, John Ralston Saul, not only oversaw the extensive repainting of the state rooms from a consistent white to more historically accurate and polychrome palette, but also worked with Ontario potter Bill Reddick to develop Rideau Hall&#x27;s first Canadian porcelain state dinner service.

Since Vincent Massey&#x27;s time as governor general, the viceroy has worked closely with the Department of Public Works and Government Services in repairing and refurbishing Rideau Hall; the department now provides a more systematic approach to the maintenance of the palace, with a full-time building manager in charge of the project. The National Capital Commission is charged with the decoration of the rooms; since 2004 the commission has undertaken a project to restore many of the salons and other state rooms to the period in which they were first built.

===McKay villa and Mappin block===
The sole remaining part of the original McKay villa is the reception room on the ground floor and the royal suite directly above. The former was created in 1913 by removing the interior partitions of the villa; the baseboards, mouldings, and trims date from that era. It is where small ceremonies and presentations take place, while the latter is an oval room that was previously the drawing room of the original McKay villa and was subsequently used as a ballroom, a studio, and a study before becoming the monarch&#x27;s bedroom. Some signs of the McKay house are still visible, notably in the now blanked window on the north wall of the reception room and the ornate plaster ceiling in the royal suite.

Directly west of these rooms is the Edwardian Mappin wing, which contains the entrance hall. Its walls are partly panelled, partly clad in marble; the lower floor covered in mosaic tile and the upper with wood. The two levels are connected by a wide, white marble, central stair; to each side, at the upper landing, are marble guards with ornate, Neoclassical balustrades. Across from the top of the stair is a door to the reception room.

In 2012, bronze and art glass handrails, funded by a private donation from Rouge Herald Extraordinary Roger Lindsay and commissioned by the National Capital Commission, were added to each side of the stair to both improve accessibility and commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. As such, bronze plaques bearing the Queen&#x27;s royal cypher, the dates 1952 and 2012, and the words were affixed to the bases of the marble stringers on either side of the staircase. The proportions and configuration of the handrails were inspired by the Edwardian architecture of the entrance hall and the decorations were intended to &quot;evoke the nation&#x27;s history, without resorting to conventional iconography.&quot; To express the work of the human hand as well as that of machines, the handrail comprises both forged or hand-tooled, fluidly shaped components—the branch-shaped bars, volute brackets, the icy, flowing patterns etched on the narrow art glass panels—with rectilinear, stock, machined-bronze pieces. This meeting of nature and human creation &quot;stands for the tie between Canada&#x27;s evolution as a country and the landscape that nurtured it.&quot; The shield of Roger Lindsay&#x27;s coat of arms is affixed discreetly to the lower newel post, on the north side of the stair.
On the opposite wall, to the left of the entrance, is the Royal Window—a stained glass piece commemorating the 40th anniversary of the accession of Elizabeth II to the throne, displaying, between the Queen&#x27;s Canadian royal standard above and the Great Seal of Canada below, the monarch&#x27;s coat of arms for Canada surrounded by the shields of each of the provincial coats of arms. Additionally, in the top two corners are images of Elizabeth&#x27;s royal cypher, balancing out representations of the Sovereign&#x27;s badges for both the Order of Canada and the Order of Military Merit in the bottom two corners. Another stained glass window is found to the right of the entrance, marking the first appointment of a Canadian-born governor general; the viceregal position is symbolized by a crowned lion holding a maple leaf and surrounded by the shields of the arms of the first seven persons to hold the post.

===The Dufferin wings===
Book-ending the Mappin wing are the tent room—used for slightly less formal gatherings—and the ballroom—the centre of state life at Rideau Hall. It is in the latter space that honours and awards ceremonies take place and members of the Cabinet are sworn in; as such, it is the second most photographed and televised room in Canada, preceded only by the House of Commons. The ballroom is also where ambassadors present their diplomatic credentials and large-scale state dinners are held; some 60,000 meals are served in the ballroom every year to up to 130 guests per function. The room can accommodate 350 people for functions not requiring tables. Both the tent room and ballroom were added during the tenure of the Earl of Dufferin.
A double-height space, the ballroom is lined with tall, arched windows placed between rectangular pilasters that are topped with gilt, acanthused capitals. Cable moulding trim surrounds most of the openings and, around the perimeter of the room, at the intersection of walls and ceiling, is a deep and ornate plaster crown moulding formed by a godroon textured frieze and a heavy dentiled bed-mould between layers of talon and gorge mouldings. Above this is the Victorian, lacunar, clear span vaulted ceiling, from the centre of which hangs a one-ton chandelier, containing 12,000 pieces of Waterford Crystal, that was presented by the British government on Victoria Day in 1951 as a token of gratitude for Canada&#x27;s role in World War II. The north wall, known as the Sovereign&#x27;s Wall, is solid and used to display portraits of monarchs or other large paintings. Also, in an alcove off the antechamber to the ballroom is a stained glass window that celebrates the excellence of Canadian performing artists and the establishment of the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Awards.

The present décor in the ballroom—powder blue walls with beige marbleized pilasters, cream trim, and shades of peach, cream, and old gold on the ceiling, all with gilt highlights—was implemented by Adrienne Clarkson when she was the Queen&#x27;s representative between 1999 and 2005. By stripping away a more monochrome palette that had been applied to the room in the 1970s, this restored the ballroom to a scheme closer to the original that was in place when the room was first completed in 1872. The carpet, which was the last element of the ballroom&#x27;s seven-year restoration project, is in &quot;mixed tones of gold, cream, and blue-green,&quot; with a lattice pattern over the body of the rug and a twisting acanthus leaf pattern (matching the pilaster capitals) around the border. It was hand-woven, using the low cut and loop technique, by Miritech Carpets in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, which is the only Canadian-owned mill in the country. Miritech also produced the rug in the state dining room. The previously used rug, in place for 16 years, was cut up and reused in secondary rooms and other residences. The new rug covers a floor made of oak set in a herringbone pattern.
The appearance of the tent room is inspired by the earlier use of striped fabric, draped on the walls and hung in swaths from the ceiling, in order to temporarily transform what was normally the tennis court into a hall for banquets and parties. The room today has a wall covering of vertically striped, red and gold fabric with a padded backing, which rises to meet the same fabric, hung in a swag fashion outwards from a single coffer in the centre of the ceiling and trimmed around the perimeter of the room with a scallop edged valence of simple passementerie and tassels. This gives the space an overall resemblance to the interior of a large tent. The west wall of the room is broken by series of windows, each paired with a double door into the long gallery on the opposite wall, and, between them, a continuous frame and panel wainscoting. All this woodwork, including the door frames and other trim, is painted in a gloss white to contrast with the textured and patterned wall fabric.

===Monck wing===
Within the Monck wing, built between 1865 and 1866, are other living quarters and drawing and dining rooms generally for non-state affairs, such as the Pauline Vanier room, a small sitting room where informal meetings are held with visiting heads of state and other officials. The room was originally created in the 1960s by Pauline Vanier out of an old aide-de-camp smoking room, giving the space pine panelling and filling it with antique furnishings from Quebec. However, it was later again refurbished to remove the tongue and groove planks Vanier had installed and which were said to be reminiscent of suburban basement panelling popular in the 1970s. The Pauline Vanier room today contains furniture and other cabinetry works by Canadian artisans, as well as works by Canadian artists such as Kenojuak Ashevak, Emily Carr, and Norval Morrisseau.

For more formal gatherings both before and after state events, as well as for entertaining visiting heads of state and their party, the large drawing room, on the south side of the Monck wing, is used. Previously called the red salon, the space underwent thorough renovations in 1901, updating it to the Edwardian style that was popular at the time, giving it boiserie panelling formed from plaster mouldings, a layered crown moulding, as well as windows and doors with chambranled montants, the latter openings also equipped with moulded, classical overdoors. On the walls of the drawing room are hung portraits depicting the viceregal consorts of previous governors general. Directly across the hall from the large drawing room is the state dining room, which is reserved for state dinners for visiting heads of state with smaller parties, with the table seating a maximum of 42 guests. in 1909, the dining room, too, was renovated to a similar Edwardian look, but its present day layout did not emerge until the late 1940s, after various subsequent renovations. The sterling silver sets on display in this room are on loan from Buckingham Palace.
The governor general&#x27;s study sits at the far east end of the Monck wing&#x27;s ground floor, next to another study allocated for the viceroy&#x27;s consort. The former is panelled in carved wood that was installed when the room was constructed in 1906, with the names of each governor general applied in succession around the room, below the dado rail and a rendition of the sovereign&#x27;s arms for the United Kingdom as a focal piece above the fireplace (reflecting the era in which the room was fitted). When the prime minister arrives for an audience with the governor in the latter&#x27;s study, he or she uses the dedicated prime minister&#x27;s entrance, which is on the north side of the Monck addition, and opens into the easternmost of the wing&#x27;s two staircases, from which it is only a short walk to the viceroy&#x27;s office. Across from the study, the library contains a complete collection of Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award winning works. This room began as a bedroom for Lady Monck, later becoming the governor general&#x27;s office, a boudoir, the military secretary&#x27;s office, a smoking room, a flower room, and a card room, before being assigned its current role in 1952.

Further, the Monck wing houses another, smaller drawing room and a billiard room. The viceregal suite, consisting of a study/living room, a large bedroom, and a kitchenette, is at the far west end of the upper floor. Also on the second level is the royal suite (the bedroom being the former parlour of the McKay villa) and the other guest bedrooms, each being named for a former British governor. The descendants of these men were approached in the 1990s with a request for donations of historical memorabilia, to which, amongst others, the Devonshires—relations of the ninth Duke of Devonshire—responded with a Regency mirror that had been used at Chatsworth House. On that floor is also a chapel, installed during the Michener period, and which was made ecumenical and opened on 2 July 1967, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, for both Anglican and Roman Catholic services.

===Art===
Originally, most of the art in Rideau Hall was the personal property of the incumbent governor general and, as with much of the furnishings, was removed upon the end of the viceroy&#x27;s commission. Starting in the 20th century, however, more and more pieces, including objets d&#x27;art, paintings, sculptures, books, furnishings, and rugs, were added to the dedicated Crown Collection for Government House, either through gifts or purchases; for instance, in 1946, Sir James Dunn presented the Crown with two paintings by Johann Zoffany. Today the collection of furnishing, art, and artifacts at Rideau Hall is composed of private gifts from the Canada Fund (a foundation created by the government of Canada) and the Friends of Rideau Hall. The pieces, though predominantly Canadian in origin—including works by Lawren Harris, Emily Carr, Jean Paul Lemieux, Bill Reid, William Kurelek, Jean-Paul Riopelle, and Allen Sapp—also represent the Far East, Europe, and other regions and can be arranged thematically, such as the Asian-influenced pieces in the long gallery and the portraits of Canadian governors general in the reception room. The Crown Collection works on display are also usually augmented with approximately 100 art pieces and antiques on loan from various museums, galleries, and private collections; this continues a tradition started in the 1930s, when the National Gallery lent pieces to the viceroy at the time, the Earl of Bessborough. In Adrienne Clarkson&#x27;s words, &quot;the mix of furniture and other objects here now reflects the country, the people who came and settled here, and became part of the Canadian story.&quot;
Additionally, since the time of Clarkson&#x27;s appointment, themed artistic exhibitions have been mounted at Rideau Hall, such as that during the tenure of Michaëlle Jean wherein the show &quot;Body and Land&quot; featured select silkscreen prints from the artist&#x27;s book &quot;The Journals of Susanna Moodie&quot; by author Margaret Atwood and artist Charles Pachter. What had been praised during Clarkson&#x27;s tenure, however, was soon critiqued when it was revealed that into Jean&#x27;s appointment, Rideau Hall&#x27;s interpretation and exhibition planner, Fabienne Fusade, was removing from sight the portraits of Canada&#x27;s past and present sovereigns and other members of the royal family, in order to fulfill Jean&#x27;s wish to make the vice-regal residence a showcase for Canadian art and give &quot;a strong image of Canada&quot;; the portrait by Jean Paul Lemieux of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh that had for decades dominated the focal wall of the ballroom was shifted to the rear wall, thereby bumping the copy of George Hayter&#x27;s state portrait of Queen Victoria that had hung there to the tent room, where the portraits of Canada&#x27;s British governors general had been collected together. These moves and removals were criticized by the editorial board of the &quot;National Post&quot;, as well as other journalists, as having &quot;demoted and ghettoized&quot; history in order to &quot;siphon off the great symbolic power of the monarchy, to further [the staff&#x27;s] particular tastes and agendas,&quot; noting that Rideau Hall should not be used &quot;primarily [as] an art gallery.&quot;

==Grounds==
Rideau Hall&#x27;s contains uniquely Canadian landscapes designed in the natural and formal styles, including broad lawns, groves of trees (there are over 10,000 trees on the property), and meandering roads and pathways. The property is surrounded by a Victorian style cast iron and cast stone fence put up from 1928 into the 1930s. The Main Gate and adjacent Gate Lodge were designed by Frederick Preston Rubidge and constructed between 1867 and 1868; the gates themselves were produced by William Glendinneng Manufacturer of Montreal. The light fixtures atop the piers to either side of the gate were added at a later date. These elements, the Gate Lodge, and the fence and other gates were together designated as a federal heritage building on 16 January 1987. The piers and ironwork of the perimeter fence were modelled on those of the Main Gate.

The entire site is divided into five distinct areas: the wooded entrance park (trees, groundcover, daffodils, and lawn), the open parkland (meadow), the sugar bush, the ornamental gardens, and the farm (out-buildings and open area). The last once included a herd of cattle and fields used to grow hay, but today the only remaining agricultural ventures are the vegetable and herb gardens that have been worked since the time of the McKay family. From these fields, plants, fruits, and edible flowers are used in the palace kitchens, and a greenhouse and flower garden provide flowers for the hall and other government buildings in Ottawa. Further, during the early spring months, the maples throughout the property are tapped for syrup making. In total, more than 10,000 trees grow on the grounds. Additionally, there is a honorary segment of the Trans Canada Trail on the property.
As with the house that sits on them, the grounds too were transformed throughout the decades: Lady Byng created the existing rock garden, with a reflecting pool and wild corner for growing trilliums and orchids; a totem pole by Kwakiutl carver Mungo Martin was gifted to the Earl Alexander of Tunis by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia-in-Council; the Fountain of Hope was initiated by Gerda Hnatyshyn to mark the International Year of Disabled Persons, built in front of Rideau Hall, and dedicated to Terry Fox; and an inukshuk by artist Kananginak Pootoogook, from Cape Dorset, Nunavut, was built to commemorate the second National Aboriginal Day, in 1997. The Canadian Heritage Garden is a formal rose garden championed by Gerda Hnatyshyn and constructed to mark the 125th anniversary of Confederation. Also, each member of the royal family or visiting dignitary to Rideau Hall is asked to plant a tree; as such, the park, mostly along the main drive, is dotted with nearly 100 trees with small plaques at their bases listing the name and office of the person who planted each particular tree. These include Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother; Diana, Princess of Wales; Prince Charles, Prince of Wales; King George VI; and numerous by Queen Elizabeth II. Foreign dignitaries who have planted trees include John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, Kofi Annan, Boris Yeltsin, Vladimir Putin, Vicente Fox, and Emperor Akihito.

Throughout their history as a royal park, the gardens have hosted numerous activities and events. The earliest governors general added amenities such as a curling rink, a skating pond (which remains in operation, making it one of the oldest rinks in North America), toboggan runs, tennis courts, and the like, and many of the guests at Rideau Hall would partake in these outdoor activities, including Prime Ministers William Lyon Mackenzie King and Robert Borden, who would often skate on the iced over pond with the viceregal family. Of the tobogganing, Lieutenant William Galwey, a member of the survey team that laid out the Canada–United States border and later visited Rideau Hall in November 1871, said: &quot;It is a most favourite amusement at Government House. Ladies go in for it. I think they like rolling over and over with the gentlemen.&quot;
The grounds of Rideau Hall have been open to the public since 1921, when the Lord Byng of Vimy&#x27;s aide-de-camp resolved to open Government House to &quot;all who had a right to be there,&quot; a move that outraged the traditionalists. Today an expanded Visitor Centre (formerly the gardener&#x27;s cottage) has been established to facilitate tours.

Garden parties are held by the viceroy in the summer months, continuing the tradition started by the Lord Lisgar in 1869, and each year the governor general holds a New Year&#x27;s Levée, an event that traces its roots back to the French royal government and which welcomes guests from the public to attend and participate in skating, sledding, and refreshments. The park also hosts the Rideau Hall Cricket Association and Ottawa Valley Cricket Council, which continues the tradition of cricket being played in the vice-regal residence&#x27;s gardens, beginning when the cricket pitch was laid out by the Viscount Monck in 1866. Matches continue to be played at the hall during summer weekends.

===Other structures===
Other than Rideau Hall itself, there are 27 buildings around the property, including Rideau Cottage (currently serving as a temporary official home for the Prime Minister and his family); offices for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, National Capital Commission, and Public Works and Government Services Canada; the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards&#x27; House; the Gasometer or Dome Building (built in 1877 as storage for coal gas used for lighting in Rideau Hall); the Visitors Centre; the Farm Building; and stables. Additionally, there are six greenhouses.

===Surrounding properties===
Though not on the grounds of Rideau Hall, St Bartholomew&#x27;s Anglican Church is located across MacKay Street on property once belonging to the MacKay Villa estate. It is regularly used by governors general and their families and sometimes by the sovereign and other members of the royal family, as well as by viceregal household staff, their families, and members of the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards, for whom the church also is a regimental chapel. Also nearby is 7 Rideau Gate, which is a guesthouse for distinguished visitors of the Crown situated just outside and facing onto the forecourt of the main gate of Rideau Hall.

<text>The Lodger are an indie pop band from Leeds, England, formed in 2004.

==History==
The Lodger formed in 2004, after Leeds label Dance to the Radio offered to put out a single on the basis of demos that Ben Siddall recorded in his bedsit, the band name inspired by his accommodation. The initial line-up was Siddall on guitar and vocals with Lisa Harker on bass and Bruce Renshaw on drums. After 3 sold-out limited 7-inches (&quot;Many Thanks For Your Honest Opinion&quot; on Dance to the Radio, &quot;Watching&quot; on Double Dragon, and &quot;Let Her Go&quot; on Angular Records) and touring around the UK and Europe with bands such as The Long Blondes and The Research, the group released their debut album &quot;Grown-Ups&quot;, produced by Alan Smyth and James Ford, in June 2007 on Angular Records in the UK, Slumberland Records in the US, Fabtone in Japan and Speak N Spell in Australia. By this time Harker and Renshaw had left the band, to be replaced by Joe Margetts and Katie James (later again replaced by Bruce Renshaw).

Critical acclaim for the album followed, drawing comparisons with Orange Juice, The Wedding Present, and Heavenly, and it was rated at number 4 in This Is Fake DIY&#x27;s &quot;Albums of 2007&quot;. The band have featured heavily on the elbo.ws charts since the release along with heavy rotation on US college radio and other stations worldwide. The album was voted as 62nd best of 2007 on www.amazon.com and 95th in Woxy.com&#x27;s Top 97 of &#x27;07. The Lodger recently completed their first tour of the US in late 2007 and then entered the studio to record their 2nd album in November. The 2nd album is titled &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; and was released in May 2008, again to a positive critical reaction.

The Guardian described the band early on in their career: &quot;Imagine a more bitter and twisted Housemartins, or early James&quot;.
