<text>Stefan Nemanjić (, ), known as Stefan the First-Crowned (, ; – 24 September 1228), was the Grand Prince of Serbia from 1196 and the King of Serbia from 1217 until his death in 1228. He was the first Serbian king by Nemanjić dynasty; due to his transformation of the Serbian Grand Principality into the Kingdom of Serbia and the assistance he provided his brother Saint Sava in establishing the Serbian Orthodox Church.

==Early life==
Stefan Nemanjić was the second-eldest son of Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja and Anastasija. His older brother and heir apparent, Vukan, ruled over Zeta and the neighbouring provinces (the highest appanage) while his younger brother Rastko (later known as &quot;Saint Sava&quot;) ruled over Hum.

The Byzantines attacked Serbia in 1191, raiding the banks of the South Morava. Grand Prince Nemanja had a tactical advantage, and began to raid the Byzantine armies. Isaac II Angelos summoned a peace treaty, and the marriage of Nemanja&#x27;s second son Stefan to Eudokia Angelina, the niece of Isaac II, was confirmed. Stefan Nemanjić received the title of &quot;sebastokrator&quot;.

==Conflict over succession==
Throughout the 12th century, Serbs were at the center of war events between Byzantium and Hungary for dominance. In such circumstances, Serbs had no chance of gaining independence. Their only chance was to look for an ally on third side.

In 1190, the German Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa drowned in the river Calycadnus. At the same time, Emperor Isaac II Angelos launched a punitive expedition against the Serbs, and Nemanja was defeated in the battle of South Morava. In fact, Constantinople did not want to subdue the Serbs, but to regain Niš and the main road to Belgrade, as well as to make allies of the rebellious Serbs. The peace treaty provided for Stefan Nemanjić, the middle son of the grand zoupan Stefan Nemanja, to marry a Byzantine princess, i.e. niece of the Byzantine emperor.

The concluded peace envisages that the grand zoupan Nemanja will be succeeded by his middle son Stefan, who received the Byzantine title of sebastokrator and the Byzantine princess Eudokia for a wife, and not the firstborn Vukan.

In 1196, at the state assembly near Church of Saints Peter and Paul, Stefan Nemanja abdicated the throne in favor of his middle son Stefan, who became the grand zoupan of Serbia. He left his eldest son Vukan in charge of Zeta, Travunija, Hvosno and Toplica. Nemanja became a monk in his old age and was given the name Simeon. Shortly afterwards, he went to Byzantium, to Mount Athos, where his youngest son Sava had been a monk for some time. They received permission from the Byzantine emperor to rebuild the abandoned Hilandar monastery.

The new Pope Innocent III, who in a letter in 1198 called on the entire West to liberate the Holy Land, was not satisfied with the fact that the Serbs were subordinated to the Patriarch of Constantinople, but wanted to return them to Rome through Vukan. In 1198, the Hungarian dux Andrew conquered Hum (Hercegovina) of grand zoupan Stefan and rebelled against brother king Emeric but did not gain legitimacy from Rome. In any case, the Hungarians became dominant on the eastern Adriatic coast. But Venice, because of its business interests, did not like the eastern coast of the Adriatic to be controlled by the mighty Byzantium or Hungary. Vukan and the Hungarian king Emeric (1196–1204) make an alliance against Stefan, after which a civil war breaks out in Serbia. The action against Stefan was preceded by his letter to the Pope in which he asked for the crown. Around 1200, Stefan expelled his wife Eudokia, a daughter of Alexios III Angelos, who found refuge with Vukan in Zeta. Emeric saw Stefan&#x27;s move as an open attack on his crown, because in Hungary it was traditionally believed that only it in the region could have primacy with the Roman pope. Stefan lost the conflicts and had to flee the country in 1202 to the ruler of Bulgaria Kaloyan.

In the meantime, control of the newly formed crusade army was taken over by the powerful Venetian doge Enrico Dandolo, who, to the surprise of all, including the pope himself, in the Fourth Crusade first sent an attack on Hungarian Zara in 1202, and then on Byzantium, whose capital Constantinople crusaders conquered in April 1204. Stefan uses this situation and in the counter-offensive, with the help of Prince Kaloyan, he returns to the throne in Ras in 1204, while Vukan retreats to Zeta. The fighting between the brothers was stopped in 1205 and relations were established as they were before the outbreak of the conflict. Meanwhile, in November 1204, the Hungarian king Emeric died and the Kaloyan of Bulgaria was crowned for king by the Pope.

Numerous states were created on the ruins of Byzantium, which were almost equal in strength. The Crusaders founded the Kingdom of Thessalonica, the principality of Achaia, the duchy of Athens and Thebes, the duchy of Archipelago or Naxos. They were all under rule of Latin emperor of Constantinople. The remaining Byzantine factions also formed their own successor states on the fringes of the empire, at Niceae and Trebizond in Asia Minor, and at Epiros in west Balkan. Of the newly created Greek states, two gained some stability and survived through this period: Niceae under the Laskaris dynasty, which soon became an empire (1208), and Epiros, which took considerably to rise to same status (1224–27). The two rivals sought to present themselves as lawful successor of Empire of the Romans and to get the upper hand in the struggle for its restoration. Bulgaria was located to the north, and Serbia to the northwest. Serbia&#x27;s neighbors at the time were Epirus to the south, Bulgaria to the east, and the Hungary to the north and west.

==Later rule==

After the death of Kaloyan, there was a succession war in Bulgaria. Tsar Boril, the most ambitious of the nobles, took the throne and exiled Alexius Slav, Ivan Asen II and Strez (of the Asen family). Strez, the first cousin or brother of Boril, took refuge in Serbia, and was warmly welcomed at the court of Stefan II. Even though Boril requested the extradition of Strez to Bulgaria with gifts and bribes, Stefan II refused. Kaloyan had conquered Belgrade, Braničevo, Niš and Prizren, all of which were claimed by Serbia. At the same time, Boril was unable to take military action against Strez and his Serbian patron, as he had suffered a major defeat at the hands of the Latins at Plovdiv. Stefan went as far as to become a blood brother with Strez, in order to assure him of his continued favor.

Andrija Mirosavljević was entitled to the governance of Hum, as the heir of Miroslav of Hum, the uncle of Stefan II, but the Hum nobles chose his brother Petar as Prince of Hum. Petar exiled Andrija and Miroslav&#x27;s widow (the sister of Ban Kulin of Bosnia), and Andrija fled to Serbia, to the court of Stefan II. In the meantime, Petar fought successfully with neighbouring Bosnia and Croatia. Stefan sided with Andrija and went to war and secured Hum and Popovo field for Andrija sometime after his accession. Petar was defeated and crossed the Neretva, continuing to rule the west and north of the Neretva, which had in 1203 been briefly occupied by Andrew II of Hungary. Stefan gave the titular and supreme rule of Hum to his son Radoslav, while Andrija held the district of Popovo with the coastal lands of Hum, including Ston. By agreement, when Radoslav died, the lands were bound to Andrija.

Đorđe of Zeta, in order to secure his lands from Stefan, accepted Venetian suzerainty, possibly in 1208. Đorđe may have done this due to tensions between the two, although this must not be the case. Venice, after the Fourth Crusade, tried to exert control of the Dalmatian ports, and managed in 1205 to submit Ragusa – Đorđe submitted to prevent that Venice claimed his ports of southern Dalmatia.

Đorđe promised Venice military aid in case of a revolt by another theoretical Venetian vassal, Dhimitër Progoni, the &quot;Prince of Albania and&quot; &quot;Lord of Kruja&quot;. This was likely related to the Serbia-Zeta conflict. Stefan II married off his daughter, Komnena, to prince Dhimitër Progoni in 1208. The marriage resulted in close ties and an alliance between Stefan and Dimitri amidst these conflicts. Kruja is conquered by Epirote Despot Michael I Komnenos Doukas, and Dimitri is not heard of in any surviving sources. After Dhimitër&#x27;s death, the lands are left to Komnena, who soon married Greek-Albanian Gregorios Kamonas, who took power of Kruja, strengthening relations with Serbia, which had after a Serbian assault on Scutari been weakened. Đorđe disappears from sources, and Stefan II controls Zeta by 1216, probably through military action. Stefan either put Zeta under his personal rule, or assigned it to his son Stefan Radoslav. Zeta would from now on have no special status, and would be given to the heir apparent.

Despot Michael I of Epirus conquered Skadar, and tried to press beyond, but was stopped by the Serbs and his murder by one of his servants in 1214 or 1215. He was succeeded by his half-brother Theodore Komnenos Doukas. Theodore took on a policy of aggressive expansion, and allied himself with Stefan II. Stefan Radoslav married Anna Angelina Komnene Doukaina, the daughter of Theodore.

==Coronation and autocephaly==

Having long wanted to call himself king, Stefan set about procuring a royal crown from the papacy. It is not clear what Stefan promised in regard to the status of the Catholic Church, which had numerous adherents in the western and coastal parts of his realm, but a papal legate finally arrived in 1217 and crowned Stefan. In 1217 Stefan Nemanjić declared his independence from Byzantium and was crowned as king, adopting the title: &quot;Crowned King and Autocrat of all Serbian and coastal lands&quot;. The influence of the Catholic Church in Serbia did not last long but angered Serbian clergy. Many opposed Stefan&#x27;s coronation. Later Serbian churchmen were also bothered by Stefan&#x27;s relations with the papacy; while Stefan and Sava&#x27;s contemporary Domentian wrote that the coronation was performed by a papal legate, a century later Theodosius the Hilandarian claimed that Stefan was crowned by Sava. The contradiction led some Serbian historians to conclude that Stefan underwent two coronations, first by the legate and in 1219 by Sava, but modern scholars tend to agree that only the former took place.

The disagreements surrounding Stefan&#x27;s coronation were definitively resolved in 2018 by finding evidences that the papal legate never came to Serbia and that Stefan was actually crowned by his brother Sava in 1219.

==Marriage, monastic vows, and death==
Stefan was married, around 1186, to Eudokia Angelina, the youngest daughter of Alexius Angelus and Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamaterina. Eudokia was the niece of the current Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelus. Isaac II arranged the marriage. According to the Greek historian Nicetas Choniates, Stefan and Eudocia quarreled and separated, accusing one another of adultery, after June 1198. They had three sons and two daughters:

* &quot;King&quot; Stefan Radoslav, ruled 1228–1233
* &quot;King&quot; Stefan Vladislav I, ruled 1233–1243
* &quot;Archbishop&quot; Sava II (born &quot;Predislav&quot;, proclaimed Saint)
* &quot;Princess&quot; Komnena Nemanjić, Grand Duchess of Kruja

Stefan remarried in 1207/1208, his second wife was Anna Dandolo, granddaughter of Venetian doge Enrico Dandolo. They had one son and one daughter:

* &quot;King&quot; Stefan Uroš I, ruled 1243–1276

He built many fortresses including Maglič. At the end of his life, Stefan took the monastic vow under the name Symeon and died soon after. He was canonized as his father was.

==Legacy==
Local tradition, related to the Reževići Monastery claims that it was king Stefan who built (in 1223 or 1226) the Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God ().

==In fiction==
* The 2017 television series &quot;Nemanjići – rađanje kraljevine&quot; (&quot;Nemanjić Dynasty – Birth of a Kingdom&quot;) features him as the main protagonist.

<doc id="276571" wikidata="Q13107370" url="?curid=276571" title="Principality of Serbia (early medieval)">
<text>The Principality of Serbia (Modern ) was one of the early medieval states of the Serbs, located in the western regions of Southeastern Europe. It existed from the 8th century up to c. 969–971 and was ruled by the Vlastimirović dynasty. Its first ruler known by name was Višeslav who started ruling around 780. While by that time, starting from the year 680–681, the Bulgarian state had taken the lands to the east. Vlastimir resisted and defeated the Bulgarian army in a three-year-war (839–842), and the two powers lived in peace for some decades. Vlastimir&#x27;s three sons succeeded in ruling Serbia together, although not for long; Serbia became a key part in the power struggle between the Byzantines and Bulgarians, predominantly allied with the Byzantines, which also resulted in major dynastic wars for a period of three decades. The principality was annexed in 924 by Simeon I and subjected to Bulgarian rule until 933 when Serbian prince Časlav was established as ruler of the Serbian land, becoming the most powerful ruler of the Vlastimirović dynasty.

An important process during this period was the Christianization of the Serbs, completed by the establishment of Christianity as state-religion in the second half of the 9th century. The principality was annexed by the Byzantines in 969–971 and ruled as the Catepanate of Ras. The main information of the history of the principality and Vlastimirović dynasty are recorded in the contemporary historical work &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; (written 948–949).

== Background ==

Slavs (Sklavenoi) settled throughout the Balkans during the 6th and the 7th centuries, thus marking the end of the early Byzantine rule in those regions. The history of the early medieval Serbian principality and the Vlastimirović dynasty is recorded in the work &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; (On the Governance of the Empire, abbr. &quot;DAI&quot;), compiled by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (r. 913–959). The work mentions the first Serbian ruler, without a name (known conventionally as &quot;Unknown Archon&quot;), that led the White Serbs to southeastern Europe and received the protection of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641), prior to the Bulgar invasion (680). The Serbian ruler was titled &quot;Prince (&quot;archon&quot;) of the Serbia&quot; (αρχων Σερβλίας). The DAI mentions that this ruler was succeeded by a son, followed by a grandson, and historians generally accept the accounts of DAI on succession of princes from the same family, but their names are unknown until the coming of Višeslav ( 780-800).

== Višeslav, Radoslav and Prosigoj (circa 780–830) ==
The time and circumstances of the first three Serbian rulers are almost unknown. The first of the dynasty known by name was Višeslav who began his rule around 780, being a contemporary of Charlemagne (fl. 768–814). The Serbs at that time were organized into &quot;župe&quot; (sing. &quot;župa&quot;), a confederation of village communities (roughly the equivalent of a county), headed by a local &quot;župan&quot; (a magistrate or governor); the governorship was hereditary, and the &quot;župan&quot; reported to the Serbian prince, whom they were obliged to aid in war. According to DAI, &quot;baptized Serbia&quot; (known erroneously in historiography as &quot;Raška&quot;), included the inhabited cities (καστρα/kastra) of Destinikon (Δεστινίκον), Tzernabouskeï (Τζερναβουσκέη), Megyretous (Μεγυρέτους), Dresneïk (Δρεσνεήκ), Lesnik (Λεσνήκ), and Salines (Σαληνές), while the &quot;small land&quot; (χοριον/chorion) of Bosnia (Βοσωνα), part of Serbia, had the cities of Katara (Κατερα) and Desnik (Δέσνηκ). The other Serb-inhabited lands (or principalities) that were mentioned included the &quot;countries&quot; of Paganija, Zahumlje and Travunija, while the &quot;land&quot; of Duklja was held by the Byzantines (it was presumably settled with Serbs as well). Given the large territory, the Serbs most likely arrived as a small military elite which managed to organize and assimilate other already settled and more numerous Slavs. These polities bordered &quot;Serbia&quot; to the north. The exact borders of the early Serbian state are unclear.

Although Višeslav is only mentioned by name, the DAI mentions that the Serbs served the Byzantine Emperor and that they were at this time at peace with the Bulgars, whose neighbors they were and with whom they shared a common frontier. The First Bulgarian Empire, under Telerig, planned to colonize some of their lands with more Slavs from the neighbouring Berziti, as the earlier Bulgar expansion had caused massive Slav migrations and depopulation of Bulgaria — in 762, more than 200,000 people fled to Byzantine territory and were relocated to Asia Minor. The Bulgars were defeated in 774, after Constantine V learned of their planned raid. In 783, a large Slavic uprising took place in the Byzantine Empire, stretching from Macedonia to the Peloponnese, which was subsequently quelled by Byzantine &quot;patrikios&quot; Staurakios.

Višeslav was succeeded by his son Radoslav, then grandson Prosigoj, and one of these two most likely ruled during the revolt of Ljudevit Posavski against the Franks (819–822); according to Einhard&#x27;s &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot;, written in 822, Ljudevit went from his seat at Sisak to the Serbs, with Einhard mentioning that for the Serbs &quot;is said to be holding a great part of Dalmatia&quot; (&quot;ad Sorabos, quae natio magnam Dalmatiae partem obtinere dicitur&quot;). According to Živković, the usage of the term Dalmatia in the &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot; to refer both to the land where Serbs ruled as well as to the lands under the rule of Croat duke, was likely a reflection of the Franks&#x27; territorial aspirations towards the entire area of the former Roman Province of Dalmatia.Though the described borders mark a large area, it is mostly a mountainous and inaccessible terrain, rugged with the high ranges of the Dinarides. Within this region, the Serbs settled only a small, isolated and mutually distant river valleys, karst fields and fertile basins. Those patches of the territory had fertile land, suitable for the agriculture, while the barely accessible, some mountain regions remained uninhabited. Višeslav&#x27;s great-grandson Vlastimir began his rule during 830s, and he is the oldest Serbian ruler on which there is more substantial data.

== Countering Bulgarian expansion (805–829) ==
In the east, the Bulgarian Empire grew strong. In 805 Krum conquered the Braničevci, Timočani and Obotrites, to the east of Serbia, and banished their tribal chiefs and replaced them with administrators appointed by the central government. In 815, the Bulgarians and Byzantines signed a 30-year peace treaty, but in 818, during the rule of Omurtag (814–836), the Braničevci and Timočani together with other tribes of the frontiers, revolted and seceded from Bulgaria because of an administrative reform that had deprived them much of their local authority. The Timočani left the &quot;society&quot; (association, alliance) of the Bulgarian Empire, and sought, together with the Danubian Obotrites and Guduscani, protection from Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious (r. 813–840), and met him at his court at Herstal. The Timočani migrated into Frankish territory, somewhere in Lower Pannonia, and were last mentioned in 819, when they were persuaded by Ljudevit to join him in fighting the Franks. The Danubian Obotrites stayed in Banat, and resisted the Bulgars until 824 when nothing more is heard of them. Krum sent envoys to the Franks and requested that the precise boundary be demarcated between them, and negotiations lasted until 826, when the Franks neglected him. The Bulgars answered by subjugating the Slavs that lived in Pannonia. Then the Bulgars sent ships up the Drava river, and, in 828, devastated Upper Pannonia north of the Drava. There was more fighting in 829 as well, and, by this time, the Bulgars had conquered all of their former Slavic allies.

The Bulgarian Empire had a general policy of expansion in which they would first impose the payment of tribute on a neighboring people and the obligation of supplying military assistance in the form of an alliance (society), leaving them internal self-government and local rulers, and when the need for this kind of relationship expired, they would terminate the self-government of the said people and impose their direct and absolute power, integrating them fully into the Bulgarian political and cultural system.

== Vlastimir, Mutimir and Prvoslav (830–892) ==
Vlastimir succeeded his father, Prosigoj, in 830. He united the Serbian tribes in the vicinity. The Serbs were alarmed, and most likely consolidated due to the spreading of the Bulgarian Empire towards their borders by the Bulgarian conquest of neighbouring Slavs, and possibly sought to cut off the Bulgar expansion to the south (Macedonia). Emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842) was recognized as the nominal suzerain (overlord) of the Serbs, and most likely encouraged them to thwart the Bulgars. The thirty-year-peace treaty between the Byzantines and Bulgars, signed in 815, was still in effect.

According to Constantine VII, the Serbs and Bulgars had lived peacefully as neighbours until the Bulgar invasion in 839 (in the last years of Theophilos). It is not known what exactly prompted the war, as Porphyrogenitus gives no clear answer; whether it was a result of Serbian-Bulgarian relations, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the Bulgar conquest to the southeast, or a result of the Byzantine-Bulgarian rivalry, in which Serbia was allied with the Byzantines. According to Porphyrogenitus, the Bulgars wanted to continue their conquest of Slav lands and subjugate the Serbs. Presian I (r. 836–852) launched an invasion into Serbian territory in 839, which led to a war that lasted for three years, in which the victorious army of Vlastimir expelled Presian from Serbia; Presian lost a large number of his men, and made no territorial gains. The Serbs had an advantage in the forests and gorges. The defeat of the Bulgars, who had become one of the greater powers in the 9th century, shows that Serbia was an organized state, fully capable of defending its borders, and possessed a very high military and administrative organization. It is not known whether Serbia at the time of Vlastimir had a fortification system and developed military structures with clearly defined roles of the &quot;župan&quot;. After the victory over the Bulgars, Vlastimir&#x27;s status rose, and according to Fine he went on to expand to the west, taking Bosnia, and Herzegovina (known as &quot;Hum&quot;). In the meantime; Braničevo, Morava, Timok, Vardar and Podrimlje were occupied by the Bulgars. Vlastimir married off his daughter to Krajina, the son of a local &quot;župan&quot; of Trebinje, Beloje, in ca. 847/848. With this marriage, Vlastimir elevated the title of Krajina to &quot;archon&quot;. The Belojević family was thus entitled to rule Travunia.

After Vlastimir&#x27;s death, the rule was divided among his three sons: Mutimir, Strojimir and Gojnik. The brothers defeated the Bulgars once again 853-854, capturing Bulgarian prince Vladimir, son of Boris of Bulgaria. After that, Serbs and the Bulgarians concluded peace. During the following period, the Christianization of the Serbs was completed. Mutimir maintained the communion with the Eastern Church (Constantinople) when Pope John VIII invited him to recognize the jurisdiction of the bishopric of Sirmium.

The Serbs and Bulgarians adopted the Old Slavonic liturgy instead of the Greek. Sometime after defeating the Bulgarians, Mutimir ousted his brothers, who fled to Bulgaria. He kept Gopnik&#x27;s son Petar Gojniković in his court, but he managed to escape to Croatia. Mutimir ruled until 890, being succeeded by his son Prvoslav. However, Prvoslav was overthrown by Petar who had returned from his exile in Croatia in 892.

== Peter, Pavle and Zaharija (892–927) ==

The name Peter suggests that Christianity had started to permeate into Serbia, undoubtedly through Serbia&#x27;s contacts with the Bulgarians and Byzantines. Peter secured himself on the throne (after fending off a challenge from Klonimir, son of Stojmir) and was recognized by Tsar Symeon I of Bulgaria. An alliance was signed between the two states. Already having Travunia&#x27;s loyalty, Peter began to expand his state north and west. He annexed the Bosna River valley, and then moved west securing allegiance from the Narentines, a fiercely independent, pirateering Slavic tribe. However, Peter&#x27;s expansion into Dalmatia brought him into conflict with Prince Michael of Zahumlje, who has also grown powerful, ruling the coastal Principality of Zachlumia.

Although allied to Simeon I of Bulgaria, Peter became increasingly disgruntled by the fact that he was essentially subordinate to him. Peter&#x27;s expansion toward the coast facilitated contacts with the Byzantines, by way of the strategies of Dyrrhachium. Searching for allies against Bulgaria, the Byzantines showered Peter with gold and promises of greater independence if he would join their alliance - a convincing strategy. Peter might have been planning an attack on Bulgaria with the Magyars, showing that his realm had stretched north to the Sava river. However, Michael of Zahumlje forewarned Symeon of this plan, since Michael was an enemy of Peter, and a loyal vassal of Symeon. What followed was multiple Bulgarian interventions and a succession of Serb rulers.

Symeon attacked Serbia (in 917) and deposed Peter, placing Pavle Branović (a grandson of Mutimir) as Prince of Serbia, subordinate to Symeon (although some scholars suggest that Symeon took control over Serbia directly at this time). Unhappy with this, the Byzantines then sent Zaharija Prvoslavljević in 920 to oust Pavle, but he failed and was sent to Bulgaria as prisoner. The Byzantines then succeeded in turning Prince Pavle to their side. In turn, Zaharija invaded Serbia with a Bulgarian force, and ousted his cousin Pavle in 922. However, he too turned to Byzantium. A punitive force sent by the Bulgarians was defeated. Thus we see a continuous cycle of dynastic strife amongst Vlastimir&#x27;s successors, stirred on by the Byzantine and Bulgarians, who were effectively using the Serbs as pawns. Whilst Bulgarian help was more effective, Byzantine help seemed preferable. Simeon made peace with the Byzantines to settle affairs with Serbia once and for all. In 924, he sent a large army accompanied by Časlav, son of Klonimir. The army forced Zaharija to flee to Croatia. The Serbian župans were then summoned to recognize Časlav as the new Prince. When they came, however, they were all imprisoned and taken to Bulgaria, as too was Časlav. Much of Serbia was ravaged, and many people fled to Croatia, Bulgaria and Constantinople. Simeon made Serbia into a Bulgarian province so that Bulgaria now bordered Croatia and Zahumlje. He then resolved to attack Croatia, because it was a Byzantine ally and had sheltered the Serbian Prince.

== Časlav (933–943/960) ==
The Bulgarian rule over Serbia lasted only nine years. After Symeon died, Časlav Klonimirović (933- c. 943/960) led Serb refugees back to Serbia. He secured the allegiance of the Dalmatian duchies and ended Bulgarian rule in central Serbia. After Tomislav&#x27;s death, Croatia was in near-anarchy as his sons vied for sole rule, so Časlav was able to extend his domain north to the Vrbas river (gaining the allegiance of the chiefs of the various Bosnian župas).

During this apogee of Serbian power, Christianity and culture penetrated Serbia, as the Serb prince lived in peaceful and cordial relations with the Byzantines. However, strong as it had grown to be, Serbia&#x27;s power (as in other early Slavic states) was only as strong as its ruler. There was no centralized rule, but instead a confederacy of Slavic principalities. The existence of the unified Grand Principality was dependent on the allegiance of the lesser princes to Časlav. When he died defending Bosnia against Magyar incursions sometime between 950 and 960, the coalition disintegrated.

After this, there is a gap in the history of hinterland Serbia (in later western sources: &quot;Rascia&quot;), as it was annexed by the Byzantine Empire ( 970). The dynasty continued to rule the maritime regions, and in the 990s, Jovan Vladimir rose as the most powerful Serbian prince, ruling over present-day Montenegro, eastern Herzegovina, and northern Albania. This state became known as &quot;Duklja&quot;, after the ancient Roman town of Doclea. However, by 997, it was made subject to tsar Samuel of Bulgaria.

When the Byzantines finally defeated the Bulgarians, they regained control over most of the Balkans for the first time in four centuries. Serbian lands were governed by a &quot;strategos&quot; presiding over the Theme of Sirmium. However, local Serbian princes continued to reign as vassals to the Byzantine Emperor, maintaining local autonomy over their lands, while only nominally being Byzantine subjects. Forts were maintained in Belgrade, Sirmium, Niš and Braničevo. These were, for the most part, in the hands of local nobility, which often revolted against Byzantine rule.

== Fall and aftermath ==

After Časlav died c. 943/960, the hinterland of Serbia was annexed by the Byzantines and reorganized as the Catepanate of Ras, (971–976). Serbia lost its centralized rule and the provinces once again came under the Empire. Jovan Vladimir emerged later as a ruler of Duklja, a small territory centered in Bar on the Adriatic coast, as a Byzantine vassal. His realm was called &quot;Serbia&quot;, &quot;Dalmatia&quot;, &quot;Sklavonia&quot;, etc., and eventually included much of the maritime provinces, including Travunia and Zachlumia. His realm probably stretched into the hinterland to include some parts of &quot;Zagorje&quot; (inland Serbia and Bosnia) as well. Vladimir&#x27;s pre-eminent position over other Slavic nobles in the area explains why Emperor Basil approached him for an anti-Bulgarian alliance. With his hands tied by war in Anatolia, Emperor Basil required allies for his war against Tsar Samuel, who ruled a Bulgarian empire stretching over Macedonia. In retaliation, Samuel invaded Duklja in 997, and pushed through Dalmatia up to the city of Zadar, incorporating Bosnia and Serbia into his realm. After defeating Vladimir, Samuel reinstated him as a vassal prince. We do not know what Vladimir&#x27;s connection was to the previous princes of Serbia, or to the rulers of Croatia—much of what is written in the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja about the genealogy of the Doclean rulers is mythological. Vladimir was murdered by Vladislav, Samuel&#x27;s nephew and successor of his son, circa 1016 AD. The last prominent member of his family, his uncle Dragimir, was killed by some local citizens in Kotor in 1018. That same year, the Byzantines defeated the Bulgarians, and in one masterful stroke re-took virtually all of southeastern Europe.

== Government ==

The Serbian ruler was titled &quot;Prince (&quot;archon&quot;) of the Serbs&quot; (αρχων Σερβλίας). In Serbian historiography, the Slavic title of &quot;knez&quot; (кнез) is used instead of the Greek &quot;arhont&quot; (архонт). The DAI mentions that the Serbian throne is inherited by &quot;the son&quot;, i.e. the first-born; his descendants succeeded him, though their names are unknown until the coming of Višeslav. The Serbs at that time were organized into &quot;župe&quot; ( &quot;župa&quot;), a confederation of village communities (roughly the equivalent of a county), headed by a local &quot;župan&quot; (a magistrate or governor); the governorship was hereditary, and the &quot;župan&quot; reported to the Serbian prince, whom they were obliged to aid in war.

Historian B. Radojković (1958) proposed that Serbia was a &quot;divided principality&quot;. According to him, Višeslav could have been a chief military leader (&quot;veliki vojvoda&quot;) who with his company seized the entire power in his hands and turned himself into a hereditary ruler, as &quot;Veliki župan&quot;; in this way, the first Serbian state was thus established after 150 years of permanent living in the new homeland and existence of military democracy. However, B. Radojković&#x27;s work was discredited by Sima Ćirković in 1960.

== Geography ==
=== Cities ===
According to , &quot;baptized Serbia&quot; included the following cities (καστρα/kastra), with spellings used in Moravcsik&#x27;s transcript (1967):

== Religion ==
By the beginning of the 7th century, Byzantine provincial and ecclesiastical order in the region was destroyed by invading Sclaveni and Pannonian Avars. The church life was renewed in the same century in the province of Illyricum and Dalmatia after a more pronounced Christianization of the Serbs and other Slavs by the Roman Church. In the 7th and mid-8th century the area wasn&#x27;t under jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Early medieval Serbs are accounted as Christian by 870s, but it was a process that ended in the late 9th century during the time of Basil I, and medieval necropolises until the 13th century in the territory of modern Serbia show an &quot;incomplete process of Christianization&quot; as local Christianity depended on the social structure (urban and rural). Basil I probably sent at least one embassy to Mutimir of Serbia, who decided to maintain the communion of Church in Serbia with the Patriarchate of Constantinople when Pope John VIII invited him to get back to the jurisdiction of the bishopric of Sirmium (see also Archbishopric of Moravia) in a letter dated to May 873. It is considered that Destinikon was an ecclesiastical centre and capital of early medieval Serbia. 
The seal of Strojimir (d. between 880 and 896), the brother of Mutimir, was bought by the Serbian state in an auction in Germany. The seal has a Patriarchal cross in the center and Greek inscriptions that say: &quot;God, help Strojimir (&quot;CTPOHMIP&quot;)&quot;.

Petar Gojniković (r. 892–917) was evidently a Christian prince. Christianity presumably was spreading in his time. Also, since Serbia bordered Bulgaria, Christian influence—and perhaps missionaries—came from there. This would increase during the twenty-year peace. The previous generation (Mutimir, Strojimir and Gojnik) had Slav names, but the following (Petar, Stefan, Pavle, Zaharija) had Christian names, an indication of strong Byzantine missions to Serbia, as well as to the Slavs of the Adriatic coast, in the 870s.

The imperial charter of Basil II from 1020 to the Archbishopric of Ohrid, in which the rights and jurisdictions were established, mentions that the Episcopy of Ras belonged to the Bulgarian autocephal church during the time of Peter I (927–969) and Samuel of Bulgaria (977–1014). It is considered that it was possibly founded by the Bulgarian emperor, or it is the latest date when could have been integrated to the Bulgarian Church. If previously existed, it probably was part of the Bulgarian metropolis of Morava, but certainly not of Durrës. If it was on the Serbian territory, seems that the Church in Serbia or part of the territory of Serbia became linked and influenced by the Bulgarian Church between 870 and 924. Anyway, the church would have been protected by Bulgarian controlled forts. By then, at the latest, Serbia must have received the Cyrillic alphabet and Slavic religious text, already familiar but perhaps not yet preferred to Greek.

Notable early church buildings include the Monastery of Holy Archangel Michael on Prevlaka, built in the beginning of the 9th century, on the location of older churches of three-nave structure with three apses to the East, dating from the 3rd and 6th centuries, Bogorodica Hvostanska (6th century) and Church of Saints Peter and Paul.

<text>Beefcake is a performance or a form of glamour photography depicting a large and muscular male body. Beefcake is also a publication genre. A role a person plays in a performance may be called &quot;beefcake&quot;. The term was believed to be first used by Hollywood columnist Sidney Skolsky.

==Actors typecast as beefcake==
Beefcake poses by male actors were used far less frequently than cheesecake (pin-up) layouts of actresses. Nevertheless, as early as the 1920s, photographs were taken of such stars as Rudolph Valentino and Ramon Novarro to highlight their physical appeal. Male physique shots of famous stars were even less frequent during the early talking picture era, outside of stars of jungle films such as Johnny Weissmuller (Tarzan) and Buster Crabbe. The 1940s saw a rise in shirtless shots of such stars as Tyrone Power, Guy Madison, Sterling Hayden and Victor Mature; and in the 1950s movie magazines began running swimsuit shots of actors such as Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter, Jeff Chandler, Robert Conrad and Robert Wagner almost as frequently as they did with actresses. This period also included the rise of bodybuilding magazines, which continue to be popular to the present day, as well as musclemen movie stars such as Steve Reeves who were often barely dressed in their action/adventure films. In the 1980s, heavily muscular actors Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lou Ferrigno, and Sylvester Stallone continued to star in beefcake-type action/adventure movies (such as &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; or &quot;Hercules&quot;).

==1970 to present==
The 1970s proved a golden age for beefcake with the debut of &quot;Playgirl&quot; magazine and its completely nude pictorials of men, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine&#x27;s famous semi-nude centerfolds of actors including Burt Reynolds, and the rise of pornography directed at both female and gay male audiences in both magazines and films.

Today, it is common to see beefcake shots of male sex symbols on the cover of general interest magazines. For many actors and models, shirtless poses are their most revealing, in line with their conservative images.

In advertisement, beefcake male models have become a popular ingredient for &quot;spicy&quot; (and often humorous) commercial spots; for example, British pop star Nick Kamen remains most famous for his 1985 beefcake performance in Levi&#x27;s &quot;Launderette&quot; TV commercial. In the ad, he strips down in order to stone-wash his blue jeans in a 1950s style public laundromat while he waits clad only in boxer shorts; it was selected for &quot;The 100 Greatest TV Ads&quot; in 2000 and followed by many others, often bare-chested.

Many professional male bodybuilders advertise their services, offering advice concerning nutrition and training, sometimes marketing their videos in which training programmes are demonstrated.

A 1999 film of the same name, &quot;Beefcake&quot;, details the history of the Athletic Model Guild, an early company known for their photos of men in various publications.

<doc id="276581" wikidata="Q491583" url="?curid=276581" title="Martin Gore">
<text>Martin Lee Gore (born 23 July 1961) is an English musician and songwriter. He is one of the founding members of the electronic music band Depeche Mode and is the band&#x27;s main songwriter. He is the band&#x27;s guitarist and keyboardist, and occasionally provides lead vocals. Gore possesses a tenor singing voice which contrasts with lead vocalist Dave Gahan&#x27;s dramatic baritone. He is also known for his flamboyant and (sometimes) androgynous stage persona. Gore has also released several solo albums and collaborated with former Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke as part of VCMG.

Gore&#x27;s songs include themes such as sex, religion and politics. He has said he feels lyrical themes that tackle issues related to solitude and loneliness are a better representation of reality, whereas he finds &quot;happy songs&quot; fake and unrealistic. At the same time, he asserts that the band&#x27;s music contains &quot;an element of hope&quot;.

In 1999, he received the Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors for &quot;International Achievement&quot;. He was given the Moog Innovation Award &quot;for his many contributions to the exploration of sound in popular music&quot; in 2019, and became a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member in late 2020 with fellow active Depeche Mode members Dave Gahan and Andy Fletcher, as well as past members Clarke and Alan Wilder. Following the death of Fletcher in May 2022, Gore became the longest-serving member of the band.

==Early life==
Martin Lee Gore was born in London, England. His biological father was an African-American G.I. stationed in Britain. Gore was raised by his stepfather David Gore and biological mother Pamela, who both worked at the Ford of Britain motor plant in Dagenham. He believed his stepfather was his biological father until the age of 30, when he learned of his biological father. Gore later met his biological father in the American South. Gore has described his upbringing as &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;stable&quot; and has said that he was an introvert who preferred to spend time reading alone rather than with school peers. However, he also stated that he enjoyed his time at school and took part in foreign exchange trips. His family briefly lived in Hornchurch during his upbringing before moving to Basildon, where he attended the Nicholas Comprehensive School. During school he was the guitarist in a local band called Norman and the Worms.

Gore taught himself to play keyboard from the 1970s, never receiving formal training. He learned to perform chart hits, figuring out their structures via the magazine &quot;Disco 45&quot;. He shared a class with Andy &quot;Fletch&quot; Fletcher, Alison Moyet and Perry Bamonte. Gore left Nicholas Comprehensive after completing his A-levels in 1979 and took a job as a bank cashier. During evenings, weekends and any other spare time, he remained involved with Norman and the Worms. He became interested in electronic music upon hearing acts such as Kraftwerk, the Human League and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD). He borrowed a Korg 700S from a friend, before purchasing a Yamaha CS5, his first synthesizer.

Gore has two younger half-sisters, Karen, born in 1967, and Jacqueline, born in 1968.

==Depeche Mode==
In 1980, Gore reunited with classmate Andy Fletcher at the Van Gogh club. Fletcher recruited him into his band Composition of Sound, along with Vince Clarke. Soon the band drafted Dave Gahan to be the band&#x27;s lead singer after hearing him sing &quot;Heroes&quot; by David Bowie. Gore is the band&#x27;s keyboardist, contributes backing vocals, and occasionally provides lead vocals.

When explaining the band&#x27;s choice for their name, &#x27;Depeche Mode&#x27; (which was taken from French fashion magazine &quot;Dépêche Mode&quot;), Gore said, &quot;It means &#x27;hurried fashion&#x27; or &#x27;fashion dispatch&#x27;. I like the sound of that.&quot; However, the magazine&#x27;s name (and hence the band&#x27;s) correctly translates to something like &quot;Fashion News&quot; or &quot;Fashion Update&quot;.

Gore wrote two tracks on Depeche Mode&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot;: &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Big Muff&quot;. &quot;Any Second Now (Voices)&quot; features Gore&#x27;s first lead vocals for the band. When Clarke announced his departure from Depeche Mode in 1981, Gore became the principal songwriter for the band. Songs Gore wrote for Depeche Mode&#x27;s second album, &quot;A Broken Frame&quot; (1982), differed musically and lyrically from Clarke&#x27;s. Gore&#x27;s writing became gradually darker and more political on subsequent Depeche Mode albums. He sings lead vocals on several of the band&#x27;s songs, notably ballads – his tenor voice provides a contrast to Gahan&#x27;s dramatic baritone.

Gore sometimes plays guitar (typically his Gretsch White Falcon or Gretsch Double Anniversary) on Depeche Mode songs. The first time guitar was used as the main instrument was on &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, although he used small guitar parts on previous songs, such as &quot;Behind the Wheel&quot; and &quot;Love, in Itself&quot;. Gore&#x27;s guitar playing developed even more on &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot;. In live performances, he switches his keyboards for his guitar on some older Depeche Mode songs, such as &quot;Never Let Me Down Again&quot; and &quot;A Question of Time&quot;. In mid-1990, Gore said, &quot;I think in a way we&#x27;ve been at the forefront of new music; sort of chipping away at the standard rock format stations.&quot;

==Other work==

Gore has released the following solo albums: &quot;Counterfeit EP&quot; (1989), &quot;Counterfeit²&quot; (2003), &quot;MG&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Third Chimpanzee&quot; (2021). He covered the song &quot;Coming Back to You&quot; for the Leonard Cohen tribute album &quot;Tower of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; (1995).

=== VCMG ===
Former Depeche Mode colleague Vince Clarke collaborated with Gore for the first time since 1981 as techno duo VCMG on an instrumental minimalist electronic dance album called &quot;Ssss&quot;, released on 12 March 2012. The first single, &quot;Spock&quot;, was originally released worldwide exclusively on Beatport on 30 November 2011. The second, &quot;Single Blip&quot;, was also released exclusively on Beatport on 20 February 2012, and the third one, &quot;Aftermaths&quot;, was released on 20 August 2012.

=== MG ===
In late February 2015, several teaser images were displayed on Gore&#x27;s official Facebook page, citing a hashtag &quot;MGxMG&quot;, which was later revealed to be a promotional tool for his new solo studio album, titled &quot;MG&quot; (named similarly to his previous collaborative album, &quot;VCMG&quot;, with Vince Clarke from 2012). In a news post on his official website and various social media on 2 March, this confirmation of his new studio album announced its release would be on 27 or 28 April and previewed a track, &quot;Europa Hymn&quot;, from the new album.

== Electric Ladyboy studio ==
Gore has a personal studio in Santa Monica with a sizeable collection of Euroracks, Moog and Erica synthesizers (among others), where he has recorded solo work and written music for Depeche Mode.

== Awards ==

On 27 May 1999, Gore was presented with an award by Daniel Miller for &quot;International Achievement&quot; by the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors at the 44th Ivor Novello Awards.

In 2019, Gore received the Moog Innovation Award &quot;for his many contributions to the exploration of sound in popular music&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gore lives in Santa Barbara, California. He started dating lingerie designer and model Suzanne Boisvert after meeting in Paris in 1989. They married in August 1994, had three children and divorced in 2006. In June 2014, he married Kerrilee Kaski, with whom he has two daughters.

Gore became a vegetarian for health and moral reasons (along with bandmate Alan Wilder) in 1983.

He had stress-induced seizures during the band&#x27;s 1993 Devotional Tour and publicly acknowledged his past alcoholism. During a break on the Devotional Tour in Denver, Colorado, he was arrested by local police and fined $50 for holding a loud party in his hotel room.

In a 2017 interview, Dave Gahan described both himself and Gore as autistic.

He is a supporter of Arsenal Football Club.

<doc id="276582" wikidata="Q1195879" url="?curid=276582" title="Ricci curvature">
<text>In differential geometry, the Ricci curvature tensor, named after Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, is a geometric object which is determined by a choice of Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian metric on a manifold. It can be considered, broadly, as a measure of the degree to which the geometry of a given metric tensor differs locally from that of ordinary Euclidean space or pseudo-Euclidean space.

The Ricci tensor can be characterized by measurement of how a shape is deformed as one moves along geodesics in the space. In general relativity, which involves the pseudo-Riemannian setting, this is reflected by the presence of the Ricci tensor in the Raychaudhuri equation. Partly for this reason, the Einstein field equations propose that spacetime can be described by a pseudo-Riemannian metric, with a strikingly simple relationship between the Ricci tensor and the matter content of the universe.

Like the metric tensor, the Ricci tensor assigns to each tangent space of the manifold a symmetric bilinear form . Broadly, one could analogize the role of the Ricci curvature in Riemannian geometry to that of the Laplacian in the analysis of functions; in this analogy, the Riemann curvature tensor, of which the Ricci curvature is a natural by-product, would correspond to the full matrix of second derivatives of a function. However, there are other ways to draw the same analogy.

For three-dimensional manifolds, the Ricci tensor contains all of the information which in higher dimensions is encoded by the more complicated Riemann curvature tensor. In part, this simplicity allows for the application of many geometric and analytic tools, which led to the solution of the Poincaré conjecture through the work of Richard S. Hamilton and Grigori Perelman.

In differential geometry, the determination of lower bounds on the Ricci tensor on a Riemannian manifold would allow one to extract global geometric and topological information by comparison (cf. comparison theorem) with the geometry of a constant curvature space form. This is since lower bounds on the Ricci tensor can be successfully used in studying the length functional in Riemannian geometry, as first shown in 1941 via Myers&#x27;s theorem.

One common source of the Ricci tensor is that it arises whenever one commutes the covariant derivative with the tensor Laplacian. This, for instance, explains its presence in the Bochner formula, which is used ubiquitously in Riemannian geometry. For example, this formula explains why the gradient estimates due to Shing-Tung Yau (and their developments such as the Cheng-Yau and Li-Yau inequalities) nearly always depend on a lower bound for the Ricci curvature.

In 2007, John Lott, Karl-Theodor Sturm, and Cedric Villani demonstrated decisively that lower bounds on Ricci curvature can be understood entirely in terms of the metric space structure of a Riemannian manifold, together with its volume form. This established a deep link between Ricci curvature and Wasserstein geometry and optimal transport, which is presently the subject of much research.

==Definition==
Suppose that formula_1 is an formula_2-dimensional 
Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold, equipped 
with its Levi-Civita connection formula_3. The 
Riemann curvature of formula_4 is a map which
takes smooth vector fields formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7, 
and returns the vector fieldformula_8on vector fields formula_9. Since formula_10 is a tensor field, for 
each point formula_11, it gives rise to a (multilinear) map:formula_12Define for each point formula_11 the map formula_14 by 

formula_15

That is, having fixed formula_6 and formula_7, then for any orthonormal basis 
formula_18 of the vector space formula_19, one has

formula_20

It is a standard exercise of (multi)linear
algebra to verify that this definition does not depend on the choice of the basis 
formula_18.

In abstract index notation, 

formula_22

Sign conventions. Note that some sources define formula_23 to be 
what would here be called formula_24 they would then define 
formula_25 as formula_26 
Although sign conventions differ about the Riemann tensor, they do not differ about 
the Ricci tensor.

===Definition via local coordinates on a smooth manifold===
Let formula_1 be a smooth Riemannian
or pseudo-Riemannian formula_2-manifold. 
Given a smooth chart formula_29 one then has functions
formula_30 and 
formula_31 for each 
formula_32 which satisfy

formula_33

for all formula_34. The latter shows that, expressed as
matrices, formula_35.
The functions formula_36 are defined by evaluating formula_37 on 
coordinate vector fields, while the functions formula_38 are defined so
that, as a matrix-valued function, they provide an inverse to the matrix-valued 
function formula_39.

Now define, for each formula_40, formula_41, formula_42, formula_43, 
and formula_44 between 1 and formula_2, the functions

formula_46

as maps formula_47.

Now let formula_29 and formula_49 be two smooth charts with formula_50.
Let formula_51 be the functions computed as above via the chart formula_29 and let formula_53 be the functions computed as above via the chart formula_49.
Then one can check by a calculation with the chain rule and the product rule that

formula_55

where formula_56 is the first derivative along formula_43th direction
of formula_58.
This shows that the following definition does not depend on the choice of 
formula_29.
For any formula_60, define a bilinear map 
formula_61 by

formula_62

where formula_63 and formula_64 are the 
components of the tangent vectors at formula_65 in formula_5 and formula_6 relative to 
the coordinate vector fields of formula_29.

It is common to abbreviate the above formal presentation in the following style:
The final line includes the demonstration that the bilinear map Ric is well-defined, 
which is much easier to write out with the informal notation.
===Comparison of the definitions===
The two above definitions are identical. The formulas defining formula_69 and formula_70 in the coordinate approach have an exact parallel in the formulas defining the Levi-Civita connection, and the Riemann curvature via the Levi-Civita connection. Arguably, the definitions directly using local coordinates are preferable, since the &quot;crucial property&quot; of the Riemann tensor mentioned above requires formula_4 to be Hausdorff in order to hold. By contrast, the local coordinate approach only requires a smooth atlas. It is also somewhat easier to connect the &quot;invariance&quot; philosophy underlying the local approach with the methods of constructing more exotic geometric objects, such as spinor fields.

The complicated formula defining formula_70 in the introductory section is the same as that in the following section. The only difference is that terms have been grouped so that it is easy to see that formula_73

==Properties==
As can be seen from the symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci tensor of a Riemannian 
manifold is symmetric, in the sense that

formula_74

for all formula_75 

It thus follows linear-algebraically that the Ricci tensor is completely determined 
by knowing the quantity formula_76 for all vectors 
formula_5 of unit length. This function on the set of unit tangent vectors 
is often also called the Ricci curvature, since knowing it is equivalent to 
knowing the Ricci curvature tensor.

The Ricci curvature is determined by the sectional curvatures of a Riemannian 
manifold, but generally contains less information. Indeed, if formula_78 is a 
vector of unit length on a Riemannian formula_2-manifold, then 
formula_80 is precisely formula_81
times the average value of the sectional curvature, taken over all the 2-planes 
containing formula_78. There is an formula_83-dimensional family 
of such 2-planes, and so only in dimensions 2 and 3 does the Ricci tensor determine 
the full curvature tensor. A notable exception is when the manifold is given a 
priori as a hypersurface of Euclidean space. The second fundamental form, 
which determines the full curvature via the Gauss–Codazzi equation, 
is itself determined by the Ricci tensor and the principal directions 
of the hypersurface are also the eigendirections of the Ricci tensor. The 
tensor was introduced by Ricci for this reason.

As can be seen from the second Bianchi identity, one has

formula_84

where formula_10 is the scalar curvature, defined in local coordinates as formula_86 This is often called the contracted second Bianchi identity.

==Direct geometric meaning==
Near any point formula_65 in a Riemannian manifold formula_1,
one can define preferred local coordinates, called geodesic normal coordinates.
These are adapted to the metric so that geodesics through formula_65 correspond
to straight lines through the origin, in such a manner that the geodesic distance
from formula_65 corresponds to the Euclidean distance from the origin. 
In these coordinates, the metric tensor is well-approximated by the Euclidean 
metric, in the precise sense that

formula_91

In fact, by taking the Taylor expansion of the metric applied to a Jacobi field along a radial geodesic in the normal coordinate system, one has
formula_92

In these coordinates, the metric volume element then has the following expansion at :

formula_93

which follows by expanding the square root of the determinant of the metric.

Thus, if the Ricci curvature formula_80 is positive
in the direction of a vector formula_78, the conical region in formula_4 
swept out by a tightly focused family of geodesic segments of length 
formula_97 emanating from formula_65, with initial velocity inside 
a small cone about formula_78, will have smaller volume than the corresponding
conical region in Euclidean space, at least provided that formula_97 
is sufficiently small. Similarly, if the Ricci curvature is negative in the 
direction of a given vector formula_78, such a conical region in the manifold 
will instead have larger volume than it would in Euclidean space.

The Ricci curvature is essentially an average of curvatures in the planes including
formula_78. Thus if a cone emitted with an initially circular (or spherical)
cross-section becomes distorted into an ellipse (ellipsoid), it is possible
for the volume distortion to vanish if the distortions along the 
principal axes counteract one another. The Ricci 
curvature would then vanish along formula_78. In physical applications, the 
presence of a nonvanishing sectional curvature does not necessarily indicate the
presence of any mass locally; if an initially circular cross-section of a cone 
of worldlines later becomes elliptical, without changing its volume, then 
this is due to tidal effects from a mass at some other location.

== Applications ==
Ricci curvature plays an important role in general relativity, where it is 
the key term in the Einstein field equations.

Ricci curvature also appears in the Ricci flow equation, first 
introduced by Richard S. Hamilton in 1982, where certain 
one-parameter families of Riemannian metrics are singled out as solutions of a 
geometrically-defined partial differential equation. 
In harmonic local coordinates the Ricci tensor can be expressed as .
formula_104
where formula_36 are the components of the metric tensor and formula_106 is the Laplace–Beltrami operator.
This fact motivates the introduction of the Ricci flow equation 
as a natural extension of the heat equation for the metric.
Since heat tends to spread through 
a solid until the body reaches an equilibrium state of constant temperature, if 
one is given a manifold, the Ricci flow may be hoped to produce an &#x27;equilibrium&#x27; 
Riemannian metric which is Einstein or of constant curvature. 
However, such a clean &quot;convergence&quot; picture cannot be achieved since many manifolds 
cannot support such metrics. A detailed study of the nature of solutions of the 
Ricci flow, due principally to Hamilton and Grigori Perelman, shows that the 
types of &quot;singularities&quot; that occur along a Ricci flow, corresponding to the 
failure of convergence, encodes deep information about 3-dimensional topology. 
The culmination of this work was a proof of the geometrization conjecture 
first proposed by William Thurston in the 1970s, which can be thought of as 
a classification of compact 3-manifolds.

On a Kähler manifold, the Ricci curvature determines the first Chern class 
of the manifold (mod torsion). However, the Ricci curvature has no analogous 
topological interpretation on a generic Riemannian manifold.

==Global geometry and topology==
Here is a short list of global results concerning manifolds with positive Ricci curvature; see also classical theorems of Riemannian geometry. Briefly, positive Ricci curvature of a Riemannian manifold has strong topological consequences, while (for dimension at least 3), negative Ricci curvature has &quot;no&quot; topological implications. (The Ricci curvature is said to be positive if the Ricci curvature function formula_80 is positive on the set of non-zero tangent vectors formula_78.) Some results are also known for pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.

#Myers&#x27; theorem (1941) states that if the Ricci curvature is bounded from below on a complete Riemannian &quot;n&quot;-manifold by formula_109, then the manifold has diameter formula_110. By a covering-space argument, it follows that any compact manifold of positive Ricci curvature must have finite fundamental group. Cheng (1975) showed that, in this setting, equality in the diameter inequality occurs if only if the manifold is isometric to a sphere of a constant curvature formula_111.
#The Bishop–Gromov inequality states that if a complete formula_2-dimensional Riemannian manifold has non-negative Ricci curvature, then the volume of a geodesic ball is less than or equal to the volume of a geodesic ball of the same radius in Euclidean formula_2-space. Moreover, if formula_114 denotes the volume of the ball with center formula_65 and radius formula_10 in the manifold and formula_117 denotes the volume of the ball of radius formula_10 in Euclidean formula_2-space then the function formula_120 is nonincreasing. This can be generalized to any lower bound on the Ricci curvature (not just nonnegativity), and is the key point in the proof of Gromov&#x27;s compactness theorem.)
#The Cheeger–Gromoll splitting theorem states that if a complete Riemannian manifold formula_1 with formula_122 contains a &quot;line&quot;, meaning a geodesic formula_123 such that formula_124 for all formula_125, then it is isometric to a product space formula_126. Consequently, a complete manifold of positive Ricci curvature can have at most one topological end. The theorem is also true under some additional hypotheses for complete Lorentzian manifolds (of metric signature formula_127) with non-negative Ricci tensor ().
#Hamilton&#x27;s first convergence theorem for Ricci flow has, as a corollary, that the only compact 3-manifolds which have Riemannian metrics of positive Ricci curvature are the quotients of the 3-sphere by discrete subgroups of SO(4) which act properly discontinuously. He later extended this to allow for nonnegative Ricci curvature. In particular, the only simply-connected possibility is the 3-sphere itself.
These results, particularly Myers&#x27; and Hamilton&#x27;s, show that positive Ricci curvature has strong topological consequences. By contrast, excluding the case of surfaces, negative Ricci curvature is now known to have &quot;no&quot; topological implications; has shown that any manifold of dimension greater than two admits a complete Riemannian metric of negative Ricci curvature. In the case of two-dimensional manifolds, negativity of the Ricci curvature is synonymous with negativity of the Gaussian curvature, which has very clear topological implications. There are very few two-dimensional manifolds which fail to admit Riemannian metrics of negative Gaussian curvature.
== Behavior under conformal rescaling ==
If the metric formula_37 is changed by multiplying it by a conformal factor 
formula_129, the Ricci tensor of the new, conformally-related metric 
formula_130 is given by
formula_131

where formula_132 is the (positive spectrum) Hodge Laplacian, i.e., 
the &quot;opposite&quot; of the usual trace of the Hessian.

In particular, given a point formula_65 in a Riemannian manifold, it is always 
possible to find metrics conformal to the given metric formula_37 for which the 
Ricci tensor vanishes at formula_65. Note, however, that this is only pointwise 
assertion; it is usually impossible to make the Ricci curvature vanish identically 
on the entire manifold by a conformal rescaling.

For two dimensional manifolds, the above formula shows that if formula_136 is a 
harmonic function, then the conformal scaling formula_137 
does not change the Ricci tensor (although it still changes its trace with respect 
to the metric unless formula_138.

==Trace-free Ricci tensor==
In Riemannian geometry and pseudo-Riemannian geometry, the 
trace-free Ricci tensor (also called traceless Ricci tensor) of a 
Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian formula_2-manifold formula_1 
is the tensor defined by

formula_141

where formula_142 and formula_10 denote the Ricci curvature 
and scalar curvature of formula_37. The name of this object reflects the 
fact that its trace automatically vanishes: 
formula_145 However, it is quite an 
important tensor since it reflects an &quot;orthogonal decomposition&quot; of the Ricci tensor.

=== The orthogonal decomposition of the Ricci tensor ===
The following, not so trivial, property is

formula_146

It is less immediately obvious that the two terms on the right hand side are orthogonal 
to each other:

formula_147

An identity which is intimately connected with this (but which could be proved directly) 
is that

formula_148

===The trace-free Ricci tensor and Einstein metrics===
By taking a divergence, and using the contracted Bianchi identity, one sees that 
formula_149 implies formula_150. 
So, provided that and formula_4 is connected, the vanishing 
of formula_7 implies that the scalar curvature is constant. One can then see 
that the following are equivalent:

* formula_149
* formula_154 for some number formula_155
* formula_156

In the Riemannian setting, the above orthogonal decomposition shows that 
formula_157 is also equivalent to these conditions. 
In the pseudo-Riemmannian setting, by contrast, the condition formula_158 
does not necessarily imply formula_159 so the most that one can say is that 
these conditions imply formula_160

In particular, the vanishing of trace-free Ricci tensor characterizes 
Einstein manifolds, as defined by the condition formula_154 
for a number formula_162 In general relativity, this equation states 
that formula_1 is a solution of Einstein&#x27;s vacuum field 
equations with cosmological constant.

==Kähler manifolds==
On a Kähler manifold formula_5, the Ricci curvature determines the 
curvature form of the canonical line bundle 
. The canonical line bundle is the top 
exterior power of the bundle of holomorphic Kähler differentials:

formula_165

The Levi-Civita connection corresponding to the metric on formula_5 gives 
rise to a connection on formula_167. The curvature of this connection is 
the 2-form defined by 

formula_168

where formula_169 is the complex structure map on the 
tangent bundle determined by the structure of the Kähler manifold. The Ricci 
form is a closed 2-form. Its cohomology class is, 
up to a real constant factor, the first Chern class of the canonical bundle, 
and is therefore a topological invariant of formula_5 (for compact formula_5) 
in the sense that it depends only on the topology of formula_5 and the 
homotopy class of the complex structure.

Conversely, the Ricci form determines the Ricci tensor by

formula_173

In local holomorphic coordinates formula_174, the Ricci form is given by

formula_175

where is the Dolbeault operator and

formula_176

If the Ricci tensor vanishes, then the canonical bundle is flat, so the 
structure group can be locally reduced to a subgroup of the 
special linear group formula_177. However, Kähler manifolds 
already possess holonomy in formula_178, and so the (restricted) 
holonomy of a Ricci-flat Kähler manifold is contained in formula_179. 
Conversely, if the (restricted) holonomy of a 2formula_2-dimensional Riemannian 
manifold is contained in formula_179, then the manifold is a Ricci-flat 
Kähler manifold .

==Generalization to affine connections==
The Ricci tensor can also be generalized to arbitrary affine connections, 
where it is an invariant that plays an especially important role in the study of 
projective geometry (geometry associated to 
unparameterized geodesics) . If formula_3 
denotes an affine connection, then the curvature tensor formula_10 is the 
(1,3)-tensor defined by

formula_184

for any vector fields formula_9. The Ricci tensor is defined to be the trace:

formula_186

In this more general situation, the Ricci tensor is symmetric if and only if there 
exists locally a parallel volume form for the connection.

== Discrete Ricci curvature ==
Notions of Ricci curvature on discrete manifolds have been defined on graphs and
networks, where they quantify local divergence properties of edges. Ollivier&#x27;s 
Ricci curvature is defined using optimal transport theory. 
A different (and earlier) notion, Forman&#x27;s Ricci curvature, is based on 
topological arguments.

<doc id="276586" wikidata="Q442431" url="?curid=276586" title="Xerox art">
<text>Xerox art (sometimes, more generically, called copy art, electrostatic art, scanography or [[xerography]]) is an art form that began in the 1960s. Prints are created by putting objects on the glass, or platen, of a photocopier and by pressing &quot;start&quot; to produce an image. If the object is not flat, or the cover does not totally cover the object, or the object is moved, the resulting image is distorted in some way. The curvature of the object, the amount of light that reaches the image surface, and the distance of the cover from the glass, all affect the final image. Often, with proper manipulation, rather ghostly images can be made. Basic techniques include: Direct Imaging, the copying of items placed on the platen (normal copy); Still Life Collage, a variation of direct imaging with items placed on the platen in a collage format focused on what is in the foreground/background; Overprinting, the technique of constructing layers of information, one over the previous, by printing onto the same sheet of paper more than once; Copy Overlay, a technique of working with or interfering in the color separation mechanism of a color copier; Colorizing, vary color density and hue by adjusting the exposure and color balance controls; Degeneration is a copy of a copy degrading the image as successive copies are made; Copy Motion, the creation of effects by moving an item or image on the platen during the scanning process. Each machine also creates different effects.

==Accessible art==
Xerox art appeared shortly after the first Xerox copying machines were made. It is often used in collage, mail art and book art. Publishing collaborative mail art in small editions of Xerox art and mailable book art was the purpose of International Society of Copier Artists (I.S.C.A.) founded in 1981 by Louise Odes Neaderland.

Throughout the history of copy art San Francisco and Rochester are mentioned frequently. Rochester was known as the Imaging Capital of the World with Eastman Kodak and Xerox, while many artists with innovative ideas created cutting edge works in San Francisco. Alongside the computer boom a copy art explosion was taking place. Copy shops were springing up all over San Francisco, and access to copiers made it possible to create inexpensive art of unique imagery. Multiple prints of assemblage and collage meant artists could share work more freely. Print on demand meant making books and magazines at the corner copy shop without censorship and with only a small outlay of funds. Comic book artists could quickly use parts of their work over and over. 

==Early history 1960s–1970s==
The first artists recognized to make copy art are Charles Arnold, Jr., and Wallace Berman. Charles Arnold, Jr., an instructor at Rochester Institute of Technology, made the first photocopies with artistic intent in 1961 using a large Xerox camera on an experimental basis. Berman, called the &quot;father&quot; of assemblage art, would use a Verifax photocopy machine (Kodak) to make copies of the images, which he would often juxtapose in a grid format. Berman was influenced by his San Francisco Beat circle and by Surrealism, Dada, and the Kabbalah. Sonia Landy Sheridan began teaching the first course in the use of copiers at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1970.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Esta Nesbitt was one of the earliest artists experimenting with xerox art. She invented three xerography techniques, named transcapsa, photo-transcapsa, and chromacapsa. Nesbitt worked closely with Anibal Ambert and Merle English at Xerox Corporation, and the company sponsored her art research from 1970 until 1972.

Seth Siegelaub and Jack Wendler made &quot;Untitled&quot; (&quot;Xerox Book&quot;) with artists Carl Andre, Robert Barry, Douglas Huebler, Joseph Kosuth, Sol LeWitt, Robert Morris, and Lawrence Weiner in 1968.

Copy artists&#x27; dependence upon the same machines does not mean that they share a common style or aesthetic. Artists as various as Ian Burn (a conceptual/process artist who made another &quot;Xerox Book&quot; in 1968), Laurie-Rae Chamberlain (a punk-inspired colour Xeroxer exhibiting in the mid 1970s) and Helen Chadwick (a feminist artist using her own body as subject matter in the 1980s) have employed photocopiers for very different purposes.

Other artists who have made significant use of the machines include: Carol Key, Sarah Willis, Joseph D. Harris, Tyler Moore, the Copyart Collective of Camden, as well as:

in continental Europe
* Guy Bleus
* Alighiero Boetti (&quot;Nove Xerox AnneMarie&quot;, 1969)
*Bruno Munari (&quot;Xerografie&quot; series, begun in 1963)
* M. Vänçi Stirnemann
* Vittore Baroni
* Piermario Ciani

in the UK
* Graham Harwood
* Tim Head
* David Hockney
* Alison Marchant
* Russell Mills

in Brazil
* León Ferrari
* Eduardo Kac
* Letícia Parente
* Mário Ramiro

in Canada
* Evergon

in the US
* Pati Hill
* Ginny Lloyd
* Tom Norton
* Sonia Landy Sheridan

In the mid-1970s Pati Hill did art experiments with an IBM copier. Hill&#x27;s resulting xerox artwork was exhibited at Centre Pompidou, Paris, the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, among other venues in Europe and the US.

==Recognition of the art form==
San Francisco had an active Xerox arts scene that started in 1976 at the LaMamelle gallery with the &quot;All Xerox&quot; exhibit and in 1980 the &quot;International Copy Art Exhibition&quot;, curated and organized by Ginny Lloyd, was also held at LaMamelle gallery. The exhibition traveled to San Jose, California, and Japan. Lloyd also made the first copy art billboard (the first of three) with a grant from Eyes and Ears Foundation.

A gallery named Studio 718 moved into the Beat poet area of San Francisco&#x27;s North Beach neighborhood. It shared space in part with Postcard Palace, where several copy artists sold postcard editions; the space also housed a Xerox 6500. At around the same time color copy calendars produced in multiple editions made by Barbara Cushman sold at her store and gallery, A Fine Hand.

In the 1980, Marilyn McCray curated the Electroworks Exhibit held at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York and International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House. On view at the Cooper Hewitt were more than 250 examples of prints, limited-edition books, graphics, animation, textiles, and 3-D pieces produced by artists and designers. 

Galeria Motivation of Montreal, Canada, held an exhibit of copy art in 1981. PostMachina, an exhibit in Bologna, Italy, held in 1984, featured copy art works.

In May 1987, artist and curator George Muhleck wrote in Stuttgart about the international exhibition &quot;Medium: Photocopie&quot; that it inquired into &quot;new artistic ways of handling photocopy.&quot; The book which accompanied the exhibition was sponsored mainly by the Goethe Institut of Montreal, with additional support from the Ministere des Affaires Culturelles du Quebec.

The complete collection I.S.C.A. Quarterlies is housed at the Jaffe Book Arts Collection of the Special Collections of the Wimberly Library at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida. The collection began in 1989 with several volumes donated by the Bienes Museum of the Modern Book, in Fort Lauderdale, FL. The Jaffe hosted an exhibition in 2010 of copy art by Ginny Lloyd, showcasing her works and copy art collection. She lectures and teaches workshops at the Jaffe on copy art history and techniques. She previously taught the workshop in 1981 at Academie Aki, Other Books and So Archive, and Jan Van Eyck Academie in The Netherlands; Image Resource Center in Cleveland and University of California - Berkeley.

In 2017–2018, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York presented &quot;Experiments in Electrostatics: Photocopy Art from the Whitney’s Collection, 1966–1986,&quot; organized by curatorial fellow Michelle Donnelly.

==Current artwork==
Copiers add to the arts, as can be seen by surrealist Jan Hathaway&#x27;s combining color xerography with other media, Carol Heifetz Neiman&#x27;s layering prismacolor pencil through successive runs of a color photocopy process (1988-1990), or R.L. Gibson&#x27;s use of large scale xerography such as in Psychomachia (2010).

 In 1991, independent filmmaker Chel White completed a 4-minute animated film titled &quot;Choreography for Copy Machine (Photocopy Cha Cha)&quot;. All of the film&#x27;s images were created solely by using the unique photographic capabilities of a Sharp mono-colour photocopier to generate sequential pictures of hands, faces, and other body parts. Layered colors were created by shooting the animation through photographic gels. The film achieves a dream-like aesthetic with elements of the sensual and the absurd. The Berlin International Film Festival describes it as &quot;a swinging essay about physiognomy in the age of photo-mechanical reproduction. The Austin Film Society dubs it, &quot;Doubtlessly the best copy machine art with delightfully rhythmic sequences of images, all to a cha-cha-cha beat.&quot; The film screened in a special program at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival, and was awarded Best Animated Short Film at the 1992 Ann Arbor Film Festival.

Manufacturers of the machines are an obvious source of funding for artistic experimentation with copiers and such companies as Rank, Xerox, Canon and Selex have been willing to lend machines, sponsor shows and pay for artists-in-residence programs.

<doc id="276589" wikidata="Q309274" url="?curid=276589" title="Rusty-spotted cat">
<text>The rusty-spotted cat (Prionailurus rubiginosus) is one of the cat family&#x27;s smallest members, of which historical records are known only from India and Sri Lanka. In 2012, it was also recorded in the western Terai of Nepal. Since 2016, the global wild population is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List as it is fragmented and affected by loss and destruction of its prime habitat, deciduous forests.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Felis rubiginosa&quot; was the scientific name used by Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1831 for a rusty-spotted cat specimen from Pondicherry, India. &quot;Prionailurus&quot; was proposed by Nikolai Severtzov in 1858 as a generic name. &quot;Prionailurus rubiginosus phillipsi&quot; was proposed by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1939 who described a specimen from Central Province, Sri Lanka and subordinated both to the genus &quot;Prionailurus&quot;.

=== Phylogeny ===
Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear DNA in tissue samples from all Felidae species revealed that the evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia in the Miocene around . Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at around .

The &quot;Prionailurus&quot; species are estimated to have had a common ancestor between , and . The rusty-spotted cat possibly genetically diverged from this ancestor between . Both models agree in the rusty-spotted cat having been the first cat of this lineage that diverged, followed by the flat-headed cat (&quot;P. planiceps&quot;) and the fishing cat (&quot;P. viverrinus&quot;). The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic relationships of the rusty-spotted cat as derived through analysis of nuclear DNA:


==Characteristics==

The rusty-spotted cat has a short reddish grey fur over most of the body with rusty spots on the back and flanks. Four blackish lines run over the eyes, and two of them extend over the neck. Six dark streaks are on each side of the head, extending over the cheeks and forehead. Its chin, throat, inner side of the limbs and belly are whitish with tiny brownish spots. It has a rusty band on the chest. Its paws and tail are uniform reddish grey.

It is the smallest wild cat in Asia and rivals the black-footed cat as the world&#x27;s smallest wild cat. It is in length, with a tail, and weighs only . The bushy tail is about half the length of the body.

==Distribution and habitat==
The distribution of the rusty-spotted cat is relatively restricted. It occurs mainly in moist and dry deciduous forests as well as scrub and grassland, but is likely absent in evergreen forest. It prefers dense vegetation and rocky areas.

In India, it was long thought to be confined to the south, but records have established that it occurs over much of the country. It was observed in eastern Gujarat&#x27;s Gir National Park, in Maharashtra&#x27;s Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve and along India&#x27;s Eastern Ghats. Camera trapping revealed its presence in Pilibhit Tiger Reserve in the Indian Terai and in Nagzira Wildlife Sanctuary in Maharashtra. 

In western Maharashtra, the rusty-spotted cat is breeding in a human dominated agricultural landscape, where rodent densities are high. In December 2014 and in April 2015, it was photographed by camera traps in Kalesar National Park, Haryana. It was also recorded by camera traps in Mirzapur Forest Division of Uttar Pradesh in 2018.

In March 2012, a rusty-spotted cat was photographed in Bardia National Park for the first time, and in March 2016 also in Shuklaphanta National Park, both in Nepal.

In Sri Lanka, there are a few records in montane and lowland rainforest. There are two distinct populations, one in the dry zone and the other in the wet zone.
In 2016, it was recorded for the first time in Horton Plains National Park at elevations of .

== Ecology and behaviour ==
Very little is known about the ecology and behaviour of the rusty-spotted cat in the wild. Captive ones are mostly nocturnal but also briefly active during the day. Most wild ones were also recorded after dark. At Horton Plain National Park in Sri Lanka, they were mostly recorded between sunset and sunrise, with limited daytime activity. Several individuals were observed hiding in trees and in caves.

It feeds mainly on rodents and birds, but also preys on lizards, frogs, and insects. It hunts primarily on the ground, making rapid, darting movements to catch its prey. It apparently ventures into trees to escape larger predators. Captive females and males both scent-mark their home range by spraying urine.

=== Reproduction ===

The female&#x27;s oestrus lasts five days, and mating is unusually brief. Since the female is likely to be vulnerable during this period, its brevity may be an adaptation to help it avoid larger predators. She prepares a den in a secluded location, and after a gestation of 65–70 days gives birth to one or two kittens. At birth, the kittens weigh just , and are marked with rows of black spots. They reach sexual maturity at around 68 weeks, by which time they have developed the distinctive adult coat pattern of rusty blotches. Rusty-spotted cats have lived for twelve years in captivity, but their lifespan in the wild is unknown.

== Threats ==
Habitat loss and the spread of cultivation are serious problems for wildlife in both India and Sri Lanka. Although there are several records of the rusty-spotted cat in cultivated and settled areas, it is not known to what degree these populations are able to persist in such areas. There have been occasional reports of rusty-spotted cat skins in trade. In some areas, it is hunted for food or as livestock pest.

==Conservation==
The Indian population is listed on CITES Appendix I. The Sri Lankan population is included on CITES Appendix II. The species is fully protected over most of its range, with hunting and trade banned in India and Sri Lanka.

As of 2010, the captive population of &quot;P. r. phillipsi&quot; comprised 56 individuals in eight institutions, of which 11 individuals were kept in the Colombo Zoo in Sri Lanka and 45 individuals in seven European zoos.

<text>A bicycle chain is a roller chain that transfers power from the pedals to the drive-wheel of a bicycle, thus propelling it. Most bicycle chains are made from plain carbon or alloy steel, but some are nickel-plated to prevent rust, or simply for aesthetics.

==History==
Obsolete chain designs previously used on bicycles included the block chain, the skip-link chain, and the Simpson lever chain. The first chains were of a simple, bushing-less design. These had inherent reliability problems and a bit more friction (and mechanical efficiency losses) than modern chains. With these limitations in mind, the Nevoigt brothers, of the German Diamant Bicycle Company, designed the roller chain in 1898, which uses bushings. More recently, the &quot;bushingless roller chain&quot; design has superseded the bushed chain. This design incorporates the bearing surface of the bushing into the inner side plate, with each plate creating half of the bushing. This reduces the number of parts needed to assemble the chain and reduces cost. The chain is also more flexible sideways, which is needed for modern derailleur gearing, because the chainline is not always straight in all gear selections.

The first solid bush-roller patent was filed by the Renold Chain company in 1880.

Early examples of chain-driven bicycles include the 1869 Guillemot and Meyer, the 1879 Lawson, the 1884 McCammon, the 1884 Starley Rover, and the 1895 Diamant.

Before the safety bicycle, bicycles did not have chains and the pedals were typically attached directly to the drive-wheel, thus limiting top speed by the diameter of the wheel and resulting in designs with front wheels as large as possible. Various linkage mechanisms were invented to raise the effective gear ratio, but with limited success. Using chain drive allowed the mechanical advantage between the drive and driven sprockets to determine the maximum speed, thereby enabling manufacturers to reduce the size of the driving wheel for safety. It also allowed for the development of variable gearing, allowing cyclists to adjust their gearing on the fly, to terrain or road inclination and their strength, obtaining an efficient and workable cadence at various speeds.

==Efficiency==
A bicycle chain can be very energy efficient: one study reported efficiencies as high as 98.6%. The study, performed in a clean laboratory environment, found that efficiency was not greatly affected by the state of lubrication. A larger sprocket will give a more efficient drive because it moves the point of pressure farther away from the axle, placing less stress on the bearings, thus reducing friction in the inner wheel. Higher chain tension was found to be more efficient: &quot;This is actually not in the direction you&#x27;d expect, based simply on friction&quot;.

==Maintenance==

How best to lubricate a bicycle chain is a commonly debated question among cyclists. Liquid lubricants penetrate to the inside of the links and are not easily displaced, but quickly attract dirt. &quot;Dry&quot; lubricants, often containing wax or Teflon, are transported by an evaporating solvent, and stay cleaner in use. The cardinal rule for long chain life is never to lubricate a dirty chain, as this washes abrasive particles into the rollers. Chains should be cleaned before lubrication. The chain should be wiped dry after the lubricant has had enough time to penetrate the links. An alternative approach is to change the (relatively cheap) chain very frequently; then proper care is less important. Some utility bicycles have fully enclosing chain guards, which virtually eliminate chain wear and maintenance. On recumbent bicycles the chain is often run through tubes to prevent it from picking up dirt, and to keep the cyclist&#x27;s leg free from oil and dirt.

===Removal===

On most upright bicycles, the chain loops through the right rear triangle made by the right chain stay and seat tube. Thus a chain must be separated, (or &quot;broken&quot; ) unless the triangle can be split (usually the seat stay). Chain can either be broken with a chain tool or at a master link. A master link, also known as a connecting link, allows the chain to be inserted or removed with simpler tools, or even no tools, for cleaning or replacement.

Some newer chain designs, such as Shimano and Campagnolo 10-speed chains, require a special replacement pin to be used when installing or reinstalling a separated chain. An alternative to this process is to install a master link, such as a SRAM Power Link or a Wippermann Connex.

==Wear==
Chain wear, often misleadingly called &quot;chain stretch&quot;, becomes an issue with extensive cycling. The wear is removal of material from the bushings and pins (or half-bushings, in the Sedis design, also, called &quot;bushing-less&quot;, where the bushing is part of the inner plate) rather than elongation of the sideplates. The tension created by pedaling is insufficient to cause the latter. Because the spacing from link to link on a worn chain is longer than the specification, those links will not precisely fit the spaces between teeth on the sprockets. This can result in increased wear on the sprockets, and possibly &quot;chain skip&quot; on derailleur drivetrains, in which pedalling tension causes the chain to slide up over the tops of the sprocket teeth and move (&quot;skip&quot;) to the next alignment, reducing power transfer and making pedalling uncomfortable.

Since chain wear is strongly aggravated by dirt getting into the links, the lifetime of a chain depends mostly on how well it is cleaned and lubricated, and does not depend on the mechanical load. Depending on use and cleaning, a chain can last only (e.g. in cross-country use, or all-weather use), for well-maintained derailleur chains, or more than for perfectly groomed high-quality chains, single-gear, or hub-gear chains with a full cover chain guard.

Nickel-plated chain also confers a measure of self-lubrication to its moving parts as nickel is a relatively non-galling metal.

Chain wear rates are highly variable. One way to measure wear is with a ruler or machinist&#x27;s rule. Another is with a chain wear tool, which typically has a &quot;tooth&quot; of about the same size found on a sprocket. They are placed on a chain under light load, and if the tooth drops in all the way, the chain should be replaced.

Twenty half-links in a new chain measure , and replacement is recommended before the old chain measures (0.7% wear). A more conservative limit is when 24 half-links in the old chain measure (0.5% wear). If the chain has worn beyond this limit, the rear sprockets are also likely to wear, in extreme cases followed by the front chainrings. In this case, the &#x27;skipping&#x27; mentioned above is liable to continue even after the chain is replaced, as the teeth of the sprockets will have become unevenly worn (in extreme cases, hook-shaped). Replacing worn sprocket cassettes and chainrings after missing the chain replacement window is much more expensive than simply replacing a worn chain.

==Sizes==
The chain in use on modern bicycles has a pitch, which is the distance from one pin center to another, ANSI standard #40, where the 4 in &quot;#40&quot; indicates the pitch of the chain in eighths of an inch; and ISO standard 606 (metric) #8, where the 8 indicates the pitch in sixteenths of an inch. Its roller diameter is .

While the exploded view diagram here shows the older type having full bushings, modern bicycle chain has &quot;half bushings&quot; formed into the inner side plates, referred to as &quot;bushingless&quot; and &quot;bushless&quot; by Sheldon Brown.

1976: Shimano briefly made their own 10 pitch Dura-Ace track-specific system with (approximately) pitch from about 1976 to 1980—called Shimano Dura-Ace 10 pitch. The Shimano 10 pitch system is incompatible with ANSI standard #40 (1/2″) e.g. chains, sprockets and so on, and was outlawed by the Japan Keirin Association, helping in its demise.

===Chain width===
Chains come in , , , or roller widths, the internal width between the inner plates.
* chains are generally used on bikes with derailleurs such as racing, touring, and mountain bikes. (Fixed sprockets and freewheels are also available in widths, so fixed-gear and single-speed bikes can be set up to use the narrower and lighter chains.)
* chains are typically used on bikes with a single rear sprocket: those with coaster brakes, hub gears, fixed gears such as track bicycles, or BMX bikes.
* chains are used on cargo bikes and tricycles.

With derailleur-equipped bicycles, the &quot;external&quot; width of the chain (measured at the connecting rivet) also matters, because chains must not be too wide for the cogset or the chain will rub on the next larger sprocket, and chains must not be too narrow, which allows them to fall between two sprockets.

Chains can also be identified by the number of rear sprockets they can support, anywhere from 3 to 13. The following list enables measuring a chain of unknown origin to determine its suitability.

* 6 speed – 7.3 mm (9⁄32 in) (Shimano HG), 7.1 mm (9⁄32 in) (SRAM, Shimano IG)
* 7 speed – (Shimano HG), (SRAM, Shimano IG)
* 8 speed – (Shimano HG), (SRAM, Shimano IG)
* 9 speed – (all brands)
* 10 speed – (Shimano, Campagnolo)
* 10 speed (narrow) – (Campagnolo, KMC)
* 10 speed (narrow, direction) – (Shimano CN-5700, CN-6700, CN-7900)
* 11 speed – (Campagnolo, KMC, Shimano CN-9000)
* 12 speed – (SRAM) 
* 13 speed – 4.9 mm wide – Campagnolo Ekar

The Wikibook, , has more details on this topic.

===Chain length===
New chains usually come in a stock length, long enough for most upright bike applications. The appropriate number of links must be removed before installation in order for the drive train to function properly. The pin connecting links can be pushed out with a chain tool to shorten, and additional links may be added to lengthen.

In the case of derailleur gears the chain is usually long enough so that it can be shifted onto the largest front chain ring and the largest rear sprocket without jamming, and not so long that, when shifted onto the smallest front chain ring and the smallest rear sprocket, the rear derailleur cannot take up all the slack. Meeting both these requirements is only possible if the rear derailleur is compatible with the gear range being used on the bike. It is broadly accepted as inadvisable to actually use the large/large and small/small gear combinations, a practice known as cross-chaining, due to chain stress and wear.

In the case of single-speed bicycles and hub gears, the chain length must match the distance between crank and rear hub and the sizes of the front chain ring and rear sprocket. These bikes usually have some mechanism for small adjustments such as horizontal dropouts, track ends, or an eccentric mechanism in the rear hub or the bottom bracket. In extreme cases, a chain half-link may be necessary.

==Variations==
In order to reduce weight, chains have been manufactured with hollow pins and with cut-outs in the links. Chains have also been made of stainless steel for corrosion resistance and titanium for weight reduction, but they are expensive. A recent trend is chains of various colors, and at least one manufacturer offers a chain model specifically for electric bicycles.

*Campagnolo
*Rohloff AG
*KMC Chain
*Shimano
*SRAM
*Wippermann

<text>Product placement, also known as embedded marketing, is a marketing technique where references to specific brands or products are incorporated into another work, such as a film or television program, with specific promotional intent. Much of this is done by loaning products, especially when expensive items, such as vehicles, are involved. In 2021, the agreements between brand owners and films and television programs were worth more than US$20 billion.

While references to brands (real or fictional) may be voluntarily incorporated into works to maintain a feeling of realism or be a subject of commentary, product placement is the deliberate incorporation of references to a brand or product in exchange for compensation. Product placements may range from unobtrusive appearances within an environment, to prominent integration and acknowledgement of the product within the work. Common categories of products used for placements include automobiles and consumer electronics. Works produced by vertically integrated companies (such as Sony) may use placements to promote their other divisions as a form of corporate synergy.

During the 21st century, the use of product placement on television has grown, particularly to combat the wider use of digital video recorders that can skip traditional commercial breaks, as well as to engage with younger demographics. Digital editing technology is also being used to tailor product placement to specific demographics or markets, and in some cases, add placements to works that did not originally have embedded advertising, or update existing placements.

==History==

===Origins===

Product placement began in the 19th century. By the time Jules Verne published the adventure novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; (1873), his fame had led transport and shipping companies to lobby to be mentioned in the story. Whether Verne was actually paid to do so remains unknown. Similarly, a painting by Édouard Manet (1881–1882) shows a bar at the Folies Bergère with distinctive bottles placed at either end of the counter. The beer bottle is immediately recognisable as Bass beer. Manet&#x27;s motivations for including branded products in his painting are unknown; it may be that it simply added to the work&#x27;s authenticity, but on the other hand the artist may have received some payment in return for its inclusion.

Research reported by Jean-Marc Lehu (2007) suggests that films produced by Auguste and Louis Lumière in 1896 were made at the request of a representative of Lever Brothers in France. The films feature Sunlight soap, which may be the first recorded instance of paid product placement in film. This led to cinema becoming one of the earliest channels used for product placement.

With the arrival of photo-rich periodicals in the late 19th century, publishers found ways of lifting their paper&#x27;s reputation by placing an issue of the magazine in photographs of prominent people. For example, the German magazine &quot;Die Woche&quot; in 1902 printed an article about a countess in her castle where she, in one of the photographs, holds a copy of the magazine in her hands.

Product placement was a common feature of many of the earliest actualities and cinematic attractions from the first ten years of cinema history.

During the next four decades, the motion picture trade journal &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; frequently cited cases of on-screen brand-name placement. Harrison condemned the practice as harmful to movie theatres, and his editorials reflected his hostility towards product placement in films. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; published its first denunciation of that practice over Red Crown gasoline&#x27;s appearance in &quot;The Garage&quot; (1920). Another editorial criticised the collaboration between the Corona Typewriter company and First National Pictures when a Corona typewriter appeared in several films in the mid-1920s including &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1925).

Recognisable brand names appeared in movies from cinema&#x27;s earliest history. Before films had narrative form in the current sense, industrial concerns financed the making of what film scholar Tom Gunning described as &quot;cinematic attractions&quot;, short films of one or two minutes. In the first decade or so of film (1895–1907) audiences attended films as &quot;fairground attractions&quot; interesting for their then-amazing visual effects. This format was better suited to product placement than narrative cinema. Leon Gurevitch argued that early cinematic attractions have more in common with television advertisements in the 1950s than they do with traditional films. Gurevitch suggested that as a result, the relationship between cinema and advertising is intertwined, suggesting that cinema was in part the result of advertising and the economic benefits that it provided early filmmakers. Segrave detailed the industries that were advertised in these early films.

===Movies and television===

====Early film====
A feature film that has expectations of reaching millions of viewers attracts marketers. In many cases the film producers request no payment for product exposure when consumer brands appear in movies. Film productions need props for scenes, so each movie&#x27;s &quot;property master&quot;, who is responsible for gathering props for the film, contacts advertising agencies or product companies directly. In addition to items for on-screen use, the product or service supplier might provide a production with complimentary products or services. Tapping product placement channels can be particularly valuable for movies when a vintage product is required—such as a sign or bottle—that is not readily available.

Although there is no definitive proof that product placement for Red Crown gasoline in &quot;The Garage&quot;, Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Mabuse the Gambler&quot; (1922) contained a prominent title card in the opening credits reading &quot;The gowns of the female stars were designed by Vally Reinecke and made in the fashion studios of Flatow-Schädler und Mossner.&quot; Among silent films to feature product placement was &quot;Wings&quot; (1927), the first to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. It contained a plug for Hershey&#x27;s chocolate. Fritz Lang&#x27;s film &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot; (1929) shows someone drinking prominently from a glass for Odol, a popular German brand of mouthwash, and his film &quot;M&quot; (1931) shows a banner display for Wrigley&#x27;s PK Chewing Gum, for approximately 20–30 seconds.

Another early example occurs in &quot;Horse Feathers&quot; (1932), where Thelma Todd&#x27;s character falls out of a canoe and into a river. She calls for a &quot;life saver&quot; and Groucho Marx tosses her a Life Savers candy. &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946) depicts a young boy with aspirations to be an explorer, displaying a prominent copy of &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine. In &quot;Love Happy&quot; (1949), Harpo cavorts on a rooftop among various billboards and at one point escapes from the villains on the old Mobil logo, the &quot;Flying Red Horse&quot;. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; severely criticised this scene in its film review and in a front-page editorial. In &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; (1949), the climactic crime is the payroll robbery of the Armour meat-packing plant, where a Bulova clock is prominently displayed.
In the 1958 British WWII movie Ice Cold in Alex, the long sought after ice cold beer in question turns out to be (clearly) a Carlsberg.

====Later films====

The James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967) featured the Toyota 2000GT, and the films &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981) film series featured conspicuous placements. The science fiction film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982) is often cited for its multiple, obvious placements, including the candy Reese&#x27;s Pieces, into the plot. In the New World Pictures dub of &quot;The Return of Godzilla&quot;, &quot;Godzilla 1985&quot;, Dr Pepper was prominently placed in the new scenes shot for the dub. In a scene shot at an American military base, a vending machine is directly between two characters, and in similar scenes characters are often depicted drinking the soft drink.

Cheerios and Coca-Cola were placed in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical &quot;Evita&quot;, in &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, and in its sequel &quot;Superman II&quot;. Clark Kent eats Cheerios for breakfast in &quot;Smallville&quot;. In &quot;Superman II&quot;″s climax, Superman crashes into a giant Coca-Cola advertisement and saves people on a bus bearing an ad for &quot;Evita&quot;, before he smashes into a Marlboro delivery truck.

In the 1993 film &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, the fast food chain Taco Bell is integrated directly into the film&#x27;s lore, depicting it as the only remaining restaurant franchise in existence by 2032. Since Taco Bell was not well known outside of the U.S., for the international release of the film it was replaced with Pizza Hut, another restaurant chain owned by Yum! Brands. Lines were re-dubbed and logos changed during post-production.

In the film &quot;Cast Away&quot;, Tom Hanks, the lead character, is a FedEx employee. A volleyball from Wilson Sporting Goods is also prominently featured in the film. References to the delivery company FedEx are made throughout the film, and the company is central to the plot. &quot;The Internship&quot; (2013), which features two unemployed slacker friends seeking employment at Google, was described by Tom Brook of the BBC as &quot;one huge advertisement for Google&quot; that took &quot;product placement to a startling new extreme&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine included it on a list of the 10 Egregious Product Placements in film.

====Early radio and television====
Over-the-air (OTA) radio and television in the United States are not funded through end user license or subscription.
In US radio since the 1930s and television since the 1950s, programs have been normally underwritten by sponsors. &quot;Soap operas&quot; were named for the consumer packaged goods products advertised by Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever. When television began to grow popular, DuMont&#x27;s 1950s &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot; show did not rely on a sole sponsor. Sponsorship continues with programs sponsored by major vendors such as Hallmark Cards.

The conspicuous display of Studebaker motor vehicles in the television series &quot;Mister Ed&quot; (1961–1966), which was sponsored by the Studebaker Corporation from 1961 to 1963, as well as the display of Ford vehicles on the series &quot;Hazel&quot; (1961–1966), which was sponsored by the Ford Motor Company from 1961 to 1965, are other examples of television product placement.

The UK commercial television network ITV broadcast admags—entertainment programs with product placement—such as &quot;Jim″s Inn&quot; until Parliament banned them in 1963.

==Types==
Placements fall into two main categories: paid and unpaid. Most product placements are unpaid. In unpaid product placements, the advertiser will usually loan or give the product to the production. The productions costs are reduced, as they would otherwise have to buy or rent the items.

Subcategories are &quot;basic&quot;, when a logo is merely visible, and &quot;advanced&quot;, whereby the product or brand is spoken by characters in the show or movie. Barter and service deals (the branded product is provided for crew use, for instance) are common. Content providers may trade product placements for help funding advertisements tied-in with a film&#x27;s release, a show&#x27;s new season or other event. Still another variant, known as an &quot;advertisement placement&quot;, displays an advertisement for the product (rather than the product itself) which appears in the production, such as an advertisement on a billboard or a bus that appears in the show.

===Brand integration===
Brand integration, a variant of product placement, is when &quot;the product or company name becomes part of the show in such a way that it contributes to the narrative and creates an environment of brand awareness beyond that produced by advanced placement.&quot; While this type of advertising is common on unscripted shows such as &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, it can also be used in scripted television. An early example was by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, when one of its stores provided the notional venue for part of the romantic comedy film &quot;Man&#x27;s Favorite Sport?&quot; (1964). On &quot;All My Children&quot; one character took a job at Revlon. The character&#x27;s job became part of the character&#x27;s development.

&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; not only prominently features Ford cars and other commercial products, but also includes a scene displaying its own promotional merchandise. One shot shows the &quot;Jurassic Park Souvenir Store&quot;, with products that it offered for sale to fans.

===Product displacement===
A real brand logo may be hidden or replaced with fictional brand names in a production, either to imitate, satirize or differentiate the product from a real corporate brand. Such a device may be required where real corporations are unwilling to license their brand names for use in the fictional work, particularly where the work holds the product in a negative light.

According to Danny Boyle, director of the film &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (2008), the makers used &quot;product displacement&quot; to accommodate sponsors such as Mercedes-Benz that refused to allow their products to be used in non-flattering settings. While Mercedes did not mind having a gangster driving their cars, they objected to their products being shown in a slum. The makers removed logos digitally in post-production, costing &quot;tens of thousands of pounds&quot;. When such issues are brought up in advance of filming, production companies often resort to &quot;greeking&quot;, the practice of simply covering logos with tape, but one of them driven by Latika is shown to have the logos on the car keys.

Similarly, in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), portions of the defunct Dixie Square Mall in Harvey, Illinois, were reconstructed in façade and used as the scene of an indoor car chase. Signage belonging to mall tenants was replaced with that of other vendors; for instance, a Walgreens would become a Toys &quot;R&quot; Us.

&quot;Cars&quot; (2006) parodies NASCAR, an advertising-heavy sport which controversially had long allowed alcohol and tobacco sponsorships. NASCAR&#x27;s sponsors were replaced with fictional or parody brands; Dinoco Oil takes pride of place, followed by a string of invented automotive aftermarket products marketed in a similar means to pharmaceutical products. &quot;Dale Earnhardt Inc.&quot; displaced &quot;Junior #8&quot;&#x27;s sponsor Budweiser to avoid advertising beer in a Disney &amp; Pixar feature. The racing series portrayed in the film is also known as the &quot;Piston Cup&quot;, as a pun on the NASCAR Cup Series&#x27; past sponsor of Winston cigarettes (during which time it was known as the &quot;Winston Cup Series&quot;; it has since been succeeded by phone carrier Sprint and energy drink Monster Energy).

===Audio vs visual===
Placements can be sound-only, visual-only or a combination of both. The Russian television show дом-2 (phonetically &quot;Dom-2&quot;) (similar to &quot;Big Brother&quot;) often features participants stating something along the lines of, &quot;Oh, did you check out the new product X by company Y yet?&quot; after which the camera zooms in on the named product, explicitly combining an audio mention with a visual image. In &quot;The Real World/Road Rules Challenge&quot; participants often make a similar comment, usually pertaining to the mobile device and carrier for a text message.

An experiment from 2002 tested the relationship between auditory vs visual product placement and if the product had higher or lower connection to the plot to how well it was remembered by viewers. The results of the experiment concluded that regardless of if the product had higher or lower connection to the plot, in either circumstance an auditory product placement was more likely to be remembered by viewers than a visual product placement.

===Branded content===

Branded content refers to works that are funded or produced by an advertiser as a vehicle for their brand. Some forms of branded content do include self-placed product placement (such as a series of made-for-TV movies produced by Walmart and Procter &amp; Gamble, which featured placements for P&amp;G products and Walmart store brands), but some (such as, most prominently, the media operations of energy drink brand Red Bull) are focused more upon producing content that is consistent with the brand&#x27;s values and demographics, rather than being a promotion for their products first and foremost.

===Cross-promotion===
Larger, vertically integrated conglomerates may include placements of their own products and services in works as a form of corporate synergy. Owing to its common ownership, Sony Pictures films have featured placements of Sony&#x27;s consumer electronics products, particularly Xperia smartphones, among other products. The James Bond films &quot;Skyfall&quot; and &quot;Spectre&quot; depict Bond using Sony Xperia T and Z5 smartphones respectively, and the Xperia T was bundled with James Bond-themed content (including ringtones, wallpapers, and behind the scenes photos from the filming of &quot;Skyfall&quot;) as a tie-in in some markets. Similarly, some 20th Century Fox films depict the then co-owned Fox News Channel as a source of in-universe news programming.

===Replacement===
Product placements can also be added or replaced during post-production. For example, placements can be added to scenes that did not already have them when originally filmed, and placements can also be modified in future airings or prints of a film or television series.

===Parodies===
The pilot episode of the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; featured the General Electric (at the time an 80% owner of NBC) Trivection oven, but was said to be a joke by the show&#x27;s creator. The show later parodied placement.

The 1988 film &quot;Return of the Killer Tomatoes&quot; mocked the concept when at one point the film stops for lack of money. The character played by George Clooney suggests product placement as a way to continue. This was followed by several scenes with blatant product placement, including a Pepsi billboard installed in front of the villain&#x27;s mansion.

The 1994 film &quot;The Making of &#x27;...And God Spoke&#x27;&quot; is a mockumentary about the filming of a biblical epic. When running low on funds to complete the film within a film, the desperate producers resort to product placement, resulting in the absurd anachronism of Moses descending from Mount Sinai carrying the Ten Commandments and a six-pack of Coca-Cola.

The film &quot;Fight Club&quot;, directed by David Fincher, bit the hand that fed it by depicting acts of violence against most of the products that paid to be placed in the film. Examples include the scene where the Apple Store is broken into, the scene where Brad Pitt and Edward Norton smash the headlights of a new Volkswagen Beetle, and try to blow up a &quot;popular coffee franchise&quot;, a thinly veiled dig at Starbucks.

The film &quot;Superstar&quot;, starring Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon, shows every resident in town driving Volkswagen New Beetles, possibly for comic effect. Similarly, the film &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; shows Adam Sandler&#x27;s character purchasing a Chevrolet Corvette for every resident of his town.

The 2006 Will Ferrell comedy film &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot; parodied the large amount of sponsorship in NASCAR, having the title character at one point drive with a &quot;dangerous and inconvenient&quot; decal of the Fig Newtons logo covering his windshield, and include a plug for Powerade into a saying of grace before dinner.

&quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; featured a scene where Wayne refuses to allow his show&#x27;s sponsor to appear on the air. When told it is part of his contract, Wayne argues that the deal &quot;didn&#x27;t include selling out&quot; while conspicuously drinking a can of Pepsi, eating Doritos, and displaying a Pizza Hut pizza. Garth then laments that &quot;people only do things because they get paid&quot; while his entire wardrobe consists of Reebok athletic wear. Finally, Wayne complains of a headache and Garth advises him to take Nuprin while cutting to a few seconds of a Nuprin TV ad.

&quot;Kung Pow! Enter the Fist&quot; spoofed its product placements, highlighting the anachronistic inclusion of a Taco Bell. In a similar vein, in &quot;Looney Tunes: Back In Action&quot;, the main characters stumble across a Wal-Mart while stranded in the middle of Death Valley and acquire supplies just for providing an endorsement. &quot;&quot; poked fun at its sponsor Sony by having one character give another a Blu-ray Disc with the tagline &quot;It&#x27;s a Sony&quot;, only for them to complain that they do not have a Blu-ray player, to which the character responds with a version in Betamax.

===Faux placements===

Some films do not wish to depict real brands onscreen, so fake brands are created for products shown onscreen.

&quot;X-Files&quot; (1993–2002) (as well as many other films and television productions) featured the fictional Morley brand of cigarettes, the choice of the Cigarette Smoking Man. The company producing Morleys was also involved in a cover-up conspiracy, &quot;Brand X&quot;.

&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; had a faux product in the climax of the film when the team faces the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Previously in the film, Stay-Puft brand marshmallows are shown in Dana&#x27;s apartment and a Stay-Puft billboard is visible (via a matte painting) when the Ghostbusters&#x27; storage grid is deactivated and the imprisoned ghosts are released. Similar in form, Mel Brooks used the same device in the comedy spoof &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, which parodied &quot;Star Wars&quot;: in one scene, he opened up a can of Perri-Air canned air, a play on the name Perrier, the brand of bottled water.

&quot;The Truman Show&quot; used fake placements to advance the narrative of the reality television set. Truman&#x27;s wife places products in front of hidden cameras, even naming them in dialogue with her husband. This increases Truman&#x27;s suspicions as he comes to realize his surroundings are intentionally fabricated.

Some filmmakers created fictional products that appear in multiple movies. Examples include Kevin Smith (Nails Cigarettes, Mooby Corporation, Chewlees Gum, Discreeto Burritos) and Quentin Tarantino (Red Apple Cigarettes, Jack Rabbit Slim&#x27;s Restaurants, Big Kahuna Burger). This went even further with the fictional brand Binford Tools which appeared in TV shows &quot;Home Improvement&quot; and &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; and in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; movie franchise, all starring Tim Allen.

This practice is also fairly common in certain comics, such as Svetlana Chmakova&#x27;s &quot;Dramacon&quot;, which makes several product-placement-esque usages of &quot;Pawky&quot;, (a modification of the name of the Japanese snack &quot;Pocky&quot;, popular among anime and manga fans) or Naoko Takeuchi&#x27;s &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, which includes numerous references to the series &quot;&quot;, from which &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; was spun off.

This practice is also common in certain &quot;reality-based&quot; video games such as the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series, which feature fictitious stores such as Ammu-Nation, Vinyl Countdown, Gash (spoofing Gap) Zip, Pizza Boy, etc.

===Reverse placement===
So-called &quot;reverse product placement&quot; creates real products to match those seen in a fictional setting, typically as a tie-in.

&quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1971) led to a real Willy Wonka candy company, established soon after the film&#x27;s release.

In 1949, Crazy Eddie was created as a fictional car dealer in the film &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot;. That name, bestowed in 1971 upon a real-life electronics chain in New York City, appeared in 1984 in an ad in &quot;Splash&quot;. Crazy Eddie&#x27;s memorable ads are parodied in &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;, featuring a duck version of the famous pitchman, and &quot;UHF&quot;, as &quot;Crazy Ernie&quot;, a used car salesman, threatens to club a baby seal if nobody comes in to buy a car.

In 2007, as a promotional tie-in for &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, 7-Eleven temporarily turned twelve of its locations into Kwik-E-Marts—a fictional chain of convenience stores within the universe of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The stores sold real-world versions of food and drink brands seen in the franchise, including Buzz Cola, Duff Beer and Krusty-O&#x27;s.

===Music and recording industries===
While radio and television stations are regulated by national governments, producers of printed or recorded works are not, leading marketers to attempt to get products mentioned in lyrics of popular songs.

In 2008, The Kluger Agency was claimed to have proposed placement of &quot;Double Happiness Jeans&quot;, a virtual sweatshop created as part of the &quot;Invisible Threads&quot; project for the 2008 Sundance Festival, in a Pussycat Dolls song for a fee. The firm was not intended to represent a commercial product. It had been invented as a collaboration between Jeff Crouse of the Anti-Advertising Agency and Stephanie Rothenberg. While the product technically existed at the time, &quot;Double Happiness&quot; was intended to be a critical piece.

In January 2009, &quot;Migra Corridos&quot;, a five-song EP including accordion ballad &quot;El Mas Grande Enemigo&quot;, had received airplay on twenty-five Mexican radio stations. The tune purports to be the lament of a would-be immigrant left to die in the Arizona desert by coyotes (people smugglers). No disclosure was made to the radio stations that the U.S. Border Patrol had commissioned the project with content devised by Elevación, a Hispanic advertising agency based in Washington, D.C., and New York City.

In 2010, a video for Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Telephone&quot; was panned by critics for displaying nine brands in nine minutes (including her own line of Heartbeats headphones), many as paid product placements. Other 2010 music videos displayed the PlentyofFish website include Natasha Bedingfield&#x27;s &quot;Touch&quot;, Flo Rida and Akon&#x27;s &quot;Available&quot;, Jason Derulo&#x27;s &quot;Ridin&#x27; Solo&quot;, and 3OH!3&#x27;s &quot;Double Vision&quot;.

In 2011, Britney Spears&#x27;s music video for &quot;Hold It Against Me&quot; advertised PlentyofFish and Sony; one &quot;Washington Post&quot; review denounced the video as an informercial.

Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s Fiat-sponsored music video &quot;Papi&quot; was edited for broadcast as a 30-second advertisement for the Fiat 500 Cabrio in 2011. The original video also advertised BlackBerry, Tous, Planet Love Match and Crown Royal.

Alcohol advertising in music videos drew criticism from Curtin University in Perth, Australia in 2011. An Alcohol Beverages Advertising Code (ABAC) exists in Australia to handle complaints, but a placement of Midori liqueur in Cobra Starship&#x27;s &quot;You Make Me Feel...&quot; was judged not to be alcohol advertising.

Rap and hip hop are notorious for the high level of product placement in lyrics and music videos; as rappers flaunt luxury brands to show off their wealthy lifestyle, companies pay to have their products named in tracks. This integration began in 1986 with Run-DMC&#x27;s &quot;My Adidas.&quot; Hennessy and Alizé are notable as alcoholic drinks which became popular after being promoted in rap.

===Comics===
South African football comic book &quot;Supa Strikas&quot; accepts product placement to allow for the comic&#x27;s free distribution. Product placement occurs throughout the publication; on players&#x27; shirts, billboards and signage, and through the branding of locations or scenarios. &quot;Supa Strikas&quot; receives the majority of its support from Chevron, via its Caltex and Texaco brands.

In markets where Chevron lacks a presence, other brands step in, e.g., including Visa in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Other brands include their logos included as both billboard and background advertising, and through the branding of locations and scenarios. These companies include Metropolitan Life, Nike, Spur Steak Ranches and the South African National Roads Agency, among others.

Other titles adopted the same system, including cricket comic &quot;Supa Tigers&quot; and &quot;Strike Zone&quot;.

==Sports==
Product placement has long been prevalent in sports at all levels.

===NFL===
While now-defunct NFL Europe allowed liberal use of team uniforms by sponsors, the main National Football League (NFL) does not. In the United States, the league prohibits logos of sponsors painted onto the fields, although Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, has their stadium&#x27;s logomark painted onto the FieldTurf field. In 2008, the league allowed sponsors on the practice jerseys of the uniforms, but not game uniforms.

In 1991, the league allowed uniform suppliers to display their logos on their NFL-related products. Since 2012, Nike has been the league&#x27;s official uniform supplier.

Early on, two of the league&#x27;s flagship teams—the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers—adopted their identity from corporate sponsors. The Packers adopted the name &quot;Packers&quot; because they were sponsored by the Indian Packing Company. They later had &quot;ACME PACKERS&quot; written on their uniforms in the early 1920s after the Acme Packing Company bought Indian Packing. The Steelers adopted their current logo in 1962 as a product-placement deal with the American Iron and Steel Institute, which owned the rights to the Steelmark logo. The Steelers later were allowed to add &quot;-ers&quot; to the Steelmark logo the following year so that they could own a trademark on the logo. (The Steelers&#x27; pre-NFL predecessors also regularly sold naming rights to companies in the Pittsburgh area.)

NFL Japan was a sponsor of the football-themed anime series &quot;Eyeshield 21&quot;.

===Auto racing===
In auto racing, the concept of the factory-backed contestant, who is provided with vehicles and technical support in return for the car&#x27;s manufacturer obtaining visibility for its products in competition, dates in NASCAR to the 1950s and Marshall Teague&#x27;s factory-backed Fabulous Hudson Hornet. &quot;Win on Sunday, sell on Monday&quot; was once a common adage among automakers.

In Formula One, a number of major racing teams were once sponsored by tobacco companies, including Marlboro (which has had tenures with Ferrari and the McLaren team. Due to tightening regulations on tobacco advertising worldwide, many of these sponsorships have either been dropped, or downplayed and replaced with subliminal versions on vehicle livery when races are held in regions with heavy restrictions or outright bans on the marketing of cigarettes (such as the European Union).

==Notable placements==
Automobiles, apparel, beverages, home goods, furniture, consumer electronics, computers, restaurants, financial institutions, travel, airlines and websites are just a few of the product categories.

FedEx provided vehicles, access, and logistical support for the making of &quot;Cast Away&quot;. The movie depicted real FedEx locations, and the company&#x27;s then CEO appears in one scene.

===Automobiles===
The most common products to be promoted in this way are automobiles. Frequently, all the important vehicles in a film or television series are supplied by one manufacturer.

The James Bond film franchise has been well known for featuring product placements for various vehicles, particularly luxury and sports cars. Aston Martin has been the most synonymous with the franchise, dating back to the appearance of the Aston Martin DB5 as Bond&#x27;s vehicle in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964).

&quot;Cars&quot; (2006) portrays a mix of real and fictional vehicles as characters. None are directly paid product placements, but many are factory-backed by manufacturers who provided technical assistance and vehicles during production. The Lexus LC 500 was featured in the 2018 film &quot;Black Panther&quot;. The Audi R8 was featured in the &quot;Iron Man&quot; film series, while the Acura NSX Roadster was featured in &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

===Apparel and accessories===
The James Bond series has also featured associations with various accessory and fashion brands, such as Rolex and Omega watches, Calvin Klein clothing, and Samsonite luggage.

Vera Wang, Carolina Herrera, Christian Lacroix, Lanvin, Dior, Oscar De La Renta, Manolo Blahnik and Vivienne Westwood were all featured in the TV series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. Under Armour has been featured in films such as the &quot;Fast and the Furious&quot; &quot;The Martian&quot;, &quot;22 Jump Street&quot;, and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;.

===Consumer electronics and computers===
Apple&#x27;s products frequently appear in films, music videos and on television. Apple has stated that they do not pay for this, but declined to discuss how its products are placed; some Apple placements have stemmed from their products&#x27; ubiquity and position as a status symbol, rather than actual paid promotion. For example, Pixar films have often included references to Apple products as an homage to company co-founder Steve Jobs, who was an early investor in the studio. Apple products are also prominently displayed in shows produced for their streaming service Apple TV+. The Wall Street Journal reported that, in a sample of 74 Apple TV+ episodes, over 700 instances of Apple product placement were shown, either on set or actively being used by characters.

The 2010 &quot;Modern Family&quot; episode &quot;Game Changer&quot; prominently featured the iPad and aired prior to its launch, while the 2015 episode &quot;Connection Lost&quot; was presented entirely from the perspective of a MacBook laptop, who interacted with other characters via FaceTime video calls and iMessage, while also using other Mac OS X applications. Show creator Steven Levitan said the show had an ongoing relationship with Apple, but did not elaborate further. In the case of the former, while the episode&#x27;s credits did state that the iPad was &quot;provided&quot; by Apple, the company did not pay the show&#x27;s broadcaster ABC for the integration, nor buy any commercial time during the episode. Similarly, Apple did not provide any financial compensation for &quot;Connection Lost&quot;, but did provide MacBook Pro and iPhone hardware for the filming, and a Mac Pro workstation for post-production.

In video games, the most common placements are for processors or graphics cards. For example, in EA&#x27;s &quot;Battlefield 2142&quot;, ads for Intel Core 2 processors appear on map billboards. EA&#x27;s &quot;The Sims&quot; contains in-game advertising for Intel and for McDonald&#x27;s. Rare&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; features ads for Samsung in their menus.

===Food and beverage===
The use of Reese&#x27;s Pieces as a prominent plot element in the film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; was the result of a sponsorship deal; it was originally intended for the titular character&#x27;s favorite food to be M&amp;M&#x27;s candies, but Mars Incorporated turned down an offer, believing the film&#x27;s alien would scare children. The Hershey Company took the sponsorship instead, which included the rights for the company to cross-promote Reese&#x27;s Pieces with the film. The deal was considered a major coup for the company; sales of Reese&#x27;s Pieces tripled, and some retailers had trouble meeting demand for the product.

Alongside criticism for trying to ride off the popularity of &quot;E.T.&quot;, the film &quot;Mac and Me&quot; was widely criticized for containing numerous placements for Coca-Cola soft drinks and the fast food chain McDonald&#x27;s; both brands are integral to the film&#x27;s plot, while McDonald&#x27;s mascot Ronald McDonald makes an appearance during a dance scene set at a McDonald&#x27;s, and is credited as appearing in the film &quot;as himself&quot;. Critics also noted that the name of the alien creature featured in the film, &quot;Mac&quot;, could also be interpreted as a reference to the chain&#x27;s notable burger, the Big Mac. Its producer R.J. Louis denied that the film was funded by McDonald&#x27;s; he had previously worked on campaigns for the company and wanted to make a film that would help benefit the Ronald McDonald House Charities, and had to pursue rights to portray the McDonald&#x27;s brand in the film (noting that he was &quot;still the only person in the universe that ever had the exclusive motion picture rights to the McDonald&#x27;s trademark, their actors, their characters, and the whole company&quot;), but did receive funding from one of the chain&#x27;s major suppliers, Golden State Foods. He also justified the extended dance scene, as trips to McDonald&#x27;s were often seen as a &quot;treat&quot; for children of the era, and explained that &quot;Mac&quot; was meant to be an acronym for &quot;Mysterious Alien Creature&quot;.

The James Bond series has also prominently featured placements for liquor, tied to the character&#x27;s recurring affinity for martinis (particularly, vespers), although &quot;Skyfall&quot; deviated from this tradition by entering into a promotional deal with Dutch brewery Heineken (which also allowed the company to feature Bond actor Daniel Craig in an accompanying ad campaign).

===Tobacco===
Tobacco companies have made direct payment to stars for using their cigarettes in films. Sylvester Stallone received US$500,000 to use Brown and Williamson tobacco products in five feature films.

In response to a &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; article accusing the industry of deliberately using product placement as an advertising strategy, the Tobacco Institute claimed that product placement is driven by filmmakers to &quot;achieve desired artistic effects but also to offset production costs&quot;. It also claimed &quot;the 1970 federal ban on cigarette advertising on television and radio does not prohibit payments to filmmakers for the use of cigarettes in a film.&quot; The rebuttal concludes with the sentiment that smoking in film provides a certain &quot;aesthetic&quot; which is legitimate and at the filmmaker&#x27;s discretion.

===Airlines===
Many airlines have advertised prominently in film, in some cases to promote a new flight route or just to increase public awareness of the company. Pan Am advertised in many films, including &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and James Bond films. American Airlines was advertised in &quot;Home Alone&quot; and &quot;Home Alone 2&quot;, and a model of a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 was shown in &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;. Mike Myers&#x27; later film, &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;, featured a major promotion with Virgin, including repainting some of Virgin&#x27;s fleet to read &quot;Virgin Shaglantic&quot;.

American Airlines and Hilton Hotels were featured in the film &quot;Up in the Air&quot;.

Turkish Airlines was featured in the film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;. Warner Bros and Turkish Airlines signed a contract together to help promote and endorse the film.

==Radio, television and publishing==

===Television===
Television shows going back to the 1970s with The Love Boat featured product placements when using the Princess Cruise Lines and shows as recent as Modern Family have featured characters trying to procure an Apple iPad.

===Literature===
In 2001, British author Fay Weldon published &quot;The Bulgari Connection&quot;, a novel commissioned by Italian jewellery company Bulgari. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, this was the first instance of a literary product-placement deal between an established writer of fiction and a commercial partner.

==Legal considerations==

===United States===
Much of U.S. broadcast law pertaining to on-air product promotion dates to the payola scandals of 1950s broadcast radio. An investigation launched in November 1959 into allegations that some radio disc jockeys had accepted bribes in return for radio airplay ended with a US$2,500 fine for disc jockey Alan Freed (of WABC and WINS) for violating commercial bribery laws. On September 13, 1960, the U.S. government banned payola in broadcasting. Under &quot;All matter broadcast by any radio station for which money, service, or other valuable consideration is directly or indirectly paid, or promised to or charged or accepted by, the station so broadcasting, from any person, shall, at the time the same is so broadcast, be announced as paid for or furnished, as the case may be, by such person...&quot; with similar and related provisions reflected in Federal Communications Commission regulations as .

These provisions have governed subsequent payola investigations, including a 2005 investigation into Sony BMG and other major record companies.

Often, a broadcaster claimed to have complied by placing an acknowledgement in an inconspicuous place, such as embedded within the credits. In 2005 U.S. Federal Communications Commission commissioner Jonathan Adelstein stated &quot;if broadcasters and cable TV companies insist on further commercializing new and other shows alike, that is their business. But if they do so without disclosing it to the viewing public, that is payola, and that is the FCC&#x27;s business.&quot;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, placement by commercial broadcasters was forbidden prior to 2011. On February 28, 2011, telecommunications regulator Ofcom legalised placements in certain types of programming. A placement must be &quot;editorially justified&quot; and not place &quot;undue prominence&quot; on the product. Product placements are not allowed for products that cannot legally be advertised on television, including alcohol, baby milk, gambling, medication, or junk food. Placements are not allowed during children&#x27;s, news, public affairs and religious programmes. Additionally, broadcasters must disclose placements on-air by displaying a &quot;PP&quot; icon for at least three seconds at the beginning of the programme, after each commercial break, and at the end of the programme. The first legal product placement on British television came during an episode of &quot;This Morning&quot;, for a Nestlé-produced coffee maker. As with all other forms of commercial advertising, the BBC is barred from furnishing product placements in its programming. One notable example was the 1970 song &quot;Lola&quot; by The Kinks, which originally referred to &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; but was quickly changed to the generic &quot;cherry cola&quot; in order to be played on BBC radio.

==Extreme examples==
&quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; included production placement for futuristic versions of Nike footwear, Pepsi-Cola and &quot;USA Today&quot;.

&quot;Blade Runner&quot; included prominent placement for many brands. The logos of Atari, Bell, Coca-Cola, Cuisinart and Pan Am, all market leaders at the time, were prominently displayed.

&quot;I, Robot&quot; offers placements for Converse, Ovaltine, Audi, FedEx, Dos Equis and JVC among others, all of them introduced within the film&#x27;s first ten minutes. One moment includes a straightforward advertisement where Will Smith&#x27;s character responds to a compliment about his shoes, to which he replies &quot;Converse All-Stars, vintage 2004&quot; (the year of the film&#x27;s release). Audi created a special car for the film, the Audi RSQ. Surveys conducted in the US showed that the placements boosted the brand&#x27;s image. The Audi RSQ appears for nine minutes, and other Audis also appear in the film. &quot;I, Robot&quot; was ranked &quot;the worst film for product placement&quot; on a British site.

In December 2003, a series of commercials were commissioned for Cristal beer, which were broadcast at the beginning of each advertising break during the broadcast of &quot;Star Wars&quot; on Canal 13, such that the spots appeared to be continuations of the preceding scenes. The campaign, titled &quot;The Force is with Cristal Beer&quot;, won awards at various international events, including at Cannes Lions.

&quot;The Island&quot; features at least 35 individual products or brands, including cars, bottled water, shoes, credit cards, beer, ice cream, and a web search engine. In the movie&#x27;s DVD Commentary track, director Michael Bay claims he added the advertisements for greater realism.

&quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; contains placements in most of the shots. This appears to be done ironically, as the plot of the film revolves around subliminal messages in advertising. The film&#x27;s general message can also be construed as an anti-consumerist one. The film neither sought nor received compensation for the placements.

The 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot;, in a scene where young James Kirk drives and crashes a Chevrolet Corvette, he operates a Nokia touch-screen smartphone. Before running the car off the cliff while being chased by a hovering motorcycle cop, the distinct Nokia trademark ring tone can be heard. The Finnish phone maker offered &quot;Star Trek&quot; apps for its phones. The use of contemporary products was ridiculed, as the scene is set in the year 2255.

&quot;The Package&quot;, a 2012 episode of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, was heavily criticised and mocked for a 50-second sequence in which a character praised Subway sandwiches and promoted the Subway diet.

The 2013 Filipino film &quot;My Little Bossings&quot; attracted criticism for its extensive use of product placement. Reviewers panned the film for being &quot;one long commercial&quot;, where advertisements for brands endorsed by the characters&#x27; actors are frequently interspersed into the film. Zig Marasigan of &quot;Rappler&quot; described the film&#x27;s use of product endorsements as &quot;some of the most distasteful examples of local product placement while no effort is made to weave them into the narrative.&quot;

In a similar vein to early radio and television programs, sponsored programs in the Philippines are not uncommon, where children&#x27;s programs like &quot;Tropang Potchi&quot; and &quot;Jollitown&quot; were produced on behalf of companies, prominently featuring products and related properties in the shows in question. Notably, the final episode of &quot;Maria Clara at Ibarra&quot; features product placement from locally produced seasoning product Magic Sarap for humorous, anachronistic reasons.

==Viewer response==
In April 2009, fans of the television series &quot;Chuck&quot; responded to a placement by Subway restaurants with a grassroots effort to save the show from cancellation. The movement gained support from cast and crew, with series star Zachary Levi leading hundreds of fans to a Subway restaurant in Birmingham, United Kingdom.

==Criticism==
Placement continues to grow, despite consumer groups such as Commercial Alert that object to the practice as &quot;an affront to basic honesty&quot;. The group requested disclosure of all product-placement arrangements and notification before and during embedded advertisements. It justifies this to allow parents to protect easily influenced children.

In 2005, the Writers Guild of America, a trade union representing authors of television scripts, objected that its members were forced to produce disguised ad copy.

Some argue that product placement may inherently affect the creativity and originality of movies as film producers may re-write scripts in order to incorporate products. Most typically, product placement and merchandise are most successful amongst specific genres of movies which may eventually limit the diversity of films.

==Research==

===Effectiveness===
As with most marketing tactics, product placement leads to explicit as well as implicit advertising effects. Explicit effects can be observed directly and are usually visible by higher recall scores. They are highly connected to the conscious mind. Implicit effects can be observed by a change in behavior – like a higher purchase intention. They are fully based on the subconscious mind. Implicit effects are more relevant for purchase decisions and therefore more valuable than explicit reactions.

According to a 2009 study of product placement in movies from 2002, product placement in movies are effective financially. The study observed the relationship of a company having a product placed in a movie and that company&#x27;s stock price. After accounting for other variables, the study found that companies on average have their stock price increase by 0.89% due to product placement during the movie&#x27;s opening.

====Recall====
Recall describes whether people can name a product after seeing it within the content. Research showed that there is a significant relationship between product placement and recall.

====Attitude====
Product placement also leads to changes in attitude towards the product or brand.

====Purchase intention====
A lot of research has shown a higher purchase intention as a result of product placement.

====Subconscious effects====
Product placement affects the audience on a conscious, but also subconscious level. Science showed that there does not even need to be an explicit, conscious effect to activate subconscious effects. For example, product placement can lead to an exclusion of competing brands from the consideration set of the audience – subconsciously. It is also hoped to bypass advertising defense reactions of consumers by focusing on the subconscious character of product placement.

====Negative effects====
Under specific circumstances, product placement can lead to no or even negative effects. This usually happens if the product placement is too obvious, while the audience also feels it is being manipulated.

====Placement moderators====

=====Congruence=====
The better the product placement fits the surrounding content, the better the implicit effectiveness (like attitude or purchase-intention) will be.

=====Audio vs visual=====
After viewing a &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode with visual, auditory and audiovisual product placements, a recall task indicated that audiovisual product placements were recalled the best, visual product placements somewhat less and audio placements least. In a recognition test audiovisual was still remembered the best but audio placements were remembered second best and visual placements were remembered third best. As indicated, the type of placement that is most effective seems to vary depending on task, but audiovisual placements seem to be often the most effective. However, audiovisual product placements are not remembered best when there is more than one audiovisual placement at once, making it hard to remember each one. In case the placement is only on the audio level, advertisers must make sure it is very prominent to have any effect at all.

=====Character attractiveness=====
People tended to like brand names that were paired with attractive faces more than those paired with unattractive faces. The more times a brand was paired with an attractive face, the more people liked it.

=====Product prominence=====
Product placement perceived to disrupt a movie, especially when repeated, were found in one study to be counterproductive. Moderate repetition of subtle product placements did not increase people&#x27;s feelings of distraction.

Products that are integrated within the plot of a movie are better recall, although not if more than one product is shown at a time. In one study placements connected to the story were recognized most often, products used by the main character were remembered less often and products in the background were remembered least often.

Placements were found more effective on a larger screen compared to on a smaller one. Also, products placed in the first half of a movie tend to be remembered better than products in the second half of a movie, which demonstrates the primacy effect.

=====Level of Involvement=====
High involvement with the program makes it easier for people to recognize the product placement. This can lead to positive effects, but might also lead to negative reactions. The same applies for high product category involvement.

===Audience demographics===

====Cultural attributes====
Older research cited a difference between different cultural areas. For example, Australians, Austrians and Germans tended to evaluate product placement more critically and show less positive reactions than Americans or people from certain Asian countries such as India.

====Age====
Children are usually more easily influenced than adults. In a 2013 study on children&#x27;s (age 6–14) ability to recognize product placement in film; the following results were found. Children between ages 6 and 9 did not understand that a company had to pay for the product to be in the film or had confusion on why a company would pay to have a product appear in a film. After age 10 most children were able to identify that an external company paid for the product to appear. Children between age 6 and 9 could not identify themselves as the target audience for the product placement. After age 10 most children understood that the product placement was targeted towards them. Children between age 6 and 9 could not identify the intention of product placement. Children between age 10 and 12 still had confusion over the intention of a company placing their product in a film. Children over the age of 12 had full understanding of the marketing intentions of a company placing its product in a film.

====Gender====
If the product is endorsed by a person, there are stronger priming effects if the audience is the same gender. Women can be influenced more easily, but show more negative reactions when the product can be described as ethically questionable (e.g. alcohol).

===Measurement===
Tools

It is very difficult to measure the effect of a product placement on viewers : access to exposed audience, recruitment, interviews, database for results comparison, independence from agencies...

And more of 70 criteria must be analysed to be comprehensive.

To measure the success of product placement, one first tracks the parameters of the placement itself, like the ease of identification, screen time, number of exposure(s), or association with a main character. That information is also often used to determine the price of a specific placement. Secondly, the effectiveness is measured using direct (for explicit memory effects) as well as indirect (for implicit memory effects) measurements.

====Measurement of the explicit memory====
Explicit effects are measured by recall or recognition tests. Subjects are asked to name the products that he or she noticed (free recall). This survey can be also aided by giving additional information like a specific product category. At recognition tests, a selection of products is shown to the interviewed person, who then needs to select the ones that he has seen before.

====Measurement of the implicit memory====
Implicit effects are measured in an indirect way by observing a change in behavior. This can be done by tracking the consideration set and buying behavior of people, measuring brain activities or using abstract indirect test settings like the word fragment or word stem completion test. The implicit association test (IAT) is also an applicable measurement tool.

===Ethics===
Many argue that product placement is ethically questionable, because it manipulates people against their will. A contrary view is, even if product placement is only perceived unconsciously, it is still evaluated by our mind. It cannot make people act against their beliefs. Most people also appreciate the fact that movies look more realistic with real brands and do not feel disturbed by the placements. Additionally, further research argues that product placement is not any different from other marketing tactics when it comes to ethics.

<text>Subhash Kak is an Indian-American computer scientist and historical revisionist. He is the Regents Professor of Computer Science Department at Oklahoma State University–Stillwater, an honorary visiting professor of engineering at Jawaharlal Nehru University, and a member of the Indian Prime Minister&#x27;s Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC).

Kak has published on the history of science, the philosophy of science, ancient astronomy, and the history of mathematics. Kak has also published on archaeoastronomy, and advocated the idea of Indigenous Aryans. Many scholars have rejected his theories on these topics in entirety, and his writings have been heavily criticized.

In 2019, the Government of India awarded him the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India, for his contributions on the history of mathematics, science, ancient astronomy and philosophy of science.

==Early life and education==
Kak was born to Ram Nath Kak, a government veterinary doctor and Sarojini Kak in Srinagar, India. His brother is the computer scientist Avinash Kak and his sister is the literary theorist Jaishree Odin.

Kak received a Bachelor of Engineering degree from the Regional Engineering College, Srinagar (now the National Institute of Technology, Srinagar) and a Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in 1970.

==Academic career==
During 1975–1976, Kak was a visiting faculty at Imperial College, London, and a guest researcher at Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill. In 1977, he was a visiting researcher at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay. In 1979, he joined Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, where he was appointed the Donald C. and Elaine T. Delaune Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. In 2007, he joined the Computer Science department at Oklahoma State University–Stillwater.

Kak proposed an efficient three-layer feed-forward neural network architecture and developed four corner classification algorithms for training it. Despite being criticized for scalability issues; it gained the attention of the electronic hardware community. Kak has argued that there are limits to artificial intelligence and that it cannot match biological intelligence. Kak has been critical of the generalization of the quantum computing to commercial scale; he argues error correction is a significant challenge for scalability although it&#x27;s fundamental to multi-purpose computing.

Kak is the Regents Professor of Computer Science Department at Oklahoma State University–Stillwater and an honorary visiting professor of engineering at Jawaharlal Nehru University. He is also an honorary visiting professor of media studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

On 28 August 2018, he was appointed member of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC) in India.

==Indology==

===Indigenous Aryanism===
Kak primarily advocates for an origin of the Indo-Aryans from Punjab (&quot;Indigenous Aryans&quot; hypothesis) in contradiction of the scholarly consensus about the validity of Indo-Aryan migration theory; Kak reads the promotion of the latter theory to stem from racist tendencies. Scholars have noted his charges to be without any basis, lacking in any critical examination and primarily intended to promote Hindu supremacy.

===Ancient astronomy in the Rig Veda===
Kak has also claimed to find evidences of advanced computing and astronomy in the Rig Veda, in what Noretta Koertge deems to be a &quot;social constructivist and postmodern attack on modern science&quot;. He insists that Vedic scientists discovered the physical laws by Yogic meditation and that it is a valid scientific method which can be only evaluated within the paradigm of Vedic assumptions and by those who have attained Yogic enlightenment. According to Meera Nanda, Kak believes in the superiority of Hindus over Muslims. In a 2004 critique, she summarized some of Kak&#x27;s views on the matter: according to Kak, Hindus built &quot;cultural empires&quot; without military conquest, in contrast to Muslim &quot;military empires&quot; reliant on conquest.

===Reviewed works===

====Archaeoastronomy – &quot;The Astronomical Code of the Rigveda&quot;====
In the book, Kak proposes that the organization of hymns in the Rig Veda was dictated by an astronomic code concerning the courses of planets—length of solar year and lunar year, the distance between sun and earth et al. He then leverages the proposition to argue for the existence of a tradition of sophisticated observational astronomy as far back as 3000 or 4000 BCE. Kak also states that the construction of fire-altars were a coded representation of their astronomic knowledge and that the Vedic civilisation were aware of the speed of light. He prepared the section on archaeoastronomical sites in India for the thematic study on &quot;Heritage Sites of Astronomy and Archaeoastronomy in the context of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention&quot; prepared for UNESCO by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

While Kak&#x27;s interpretation has been included in recent overviews of astronomy in the Vedic period in India and the West, his chronology and astronomical calculations have been critiqued by several Indologists, such as Michael Witzel, and the noted historian of mathematics Kim Plofker.

Kim Plofker rejected Kak&#x27;s probabilistic analysis of the presence of planetary period numbers in the Rigveda&#x27;s hymn number combinations, showing that Kak&#x27;s apparent matches have &quot;no statistical significance whatever&quot;. Witzel has rejected his analysis to be suffering from several shortcomings and questioned his usage of arbitrary multiplication factors to lead to the results. Kak&#x27;s method depends on the structure of the Rigveda as redacted by the shakhas in the late Brahmana period, well within the Indian Iron Age, when it was organized into mandalas (&quot;books&quot;). According to Witzel, this leaves Kak&#x27;s approach attempt to date the text flawed, because this process of redaction took place long after the composition of the individual hymns during the &quot;samhita prose&quot; period. Witzel concludes that the entire issue boiled down to an over-interpretation of some facts that were internally inconsistent and more, to the creativeness of Kak who was pre-motivated to find evidence of astronomy at every verse of Rig Veda. Meera Nanda criticized the arbitrary and absurd nature of Kak&#x27;s analysis at length and noted his method to be &quot;breathtakingly ad hoc&quot; which &quot;reads like numerology.&quot; M A Mehendale, in a review over &quot;Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute&quot;, criticized the book for its many shortcomings which did not stand the scrutiny of rigor and remarked it to contain inaccurate and misleading statements. S. G. Dani, a Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar prize recipient rejected Kak&#x27;s hypothesis as unscientific and highly speculative with extremely vague details and whose results were statistically insignificant.

Klaus Klostermaier in his book &quot;A Survey of Hinduism&quot; praised Kak, for opening up an &quot;entirely new approach to the study of Vedic cosmology from an empirical astronomical/mathematical viewpoint&quot;. Klostermaier&#x27;s books have been heavily criticized for offering pro-Hindu views that have little currency in scholarship.

Kak&#x27;s work influenced Raja Ram Mohan Roy&#x27;s 1999 book &quot;Vedic Physics: Scientific Origin of Hinduism,&quot; which sought to prove that the RigVeda was coded per the laws of quantum and particle physics. Kak wrote the foreword to this book commending Roy&#x27;s interpretations as a new way of looking at Vedic Physics. Meera Nanda, one of Kak&#x27;s foremost critics, noted the result to be a &quot;shameful demeaning of physics as well as the Vedas&quot; and resembling &quot;ravings of mad men&quot;.

====&quot;In Search of the Cradle of Civilization&quot;====
Kak co-authored &quot;In Search of the Cradle of Civilization&quot; with Georg Feuerstein and David Frawley, equating the Vedic Aryans with the Harappans and thus, participating in the political controversy around the &quot;Indigenous Aryans&quot; theory. The chronology espoused in this book is based on the archaeoastronomical readings obtained by correlating textual references and archaeological remains.

A review by Indian archaeologist M. K. Dhavalikar over &quot;Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute&quot; noted it to be a &quot;beautifully printed&quot; contribution that made a strong case for their indigenous theory against the supposed migratory hypotheses, but chose to remain silent on certain crucial aspects which need to be convincingly explained. Guy Beck showered glowing praises on the book in his review over the &quot;Yoga Journal.&quot; Klostermaier et al. praised the book. Prema Kurien noted that the book sought to distinguish expatriate Hindu Americans from other minority groups by demonstrating their superior racial and cultural ties with the Europeans.

===Reception===
Edwin Bryant calls him a well read and articulate spokesman for the Indigenous Aryan hypothesis and for other issues concerning ancient Indian science and culture.

Scholars have rejected his theories in entirety and his writings have been heavily criticized. Acute misrepresentation of facts coupled with wrong observations, extremely flexible and often self-contradictory analysis, cherry picking of data and forwarding of easily disprovable hypotheses have been located. His understanding of linguistics and subsequent assertion have been challenged. Romila Thapar calls Kak an amateur historian whose views on the Indus Civilization were fringe and who was part of a group that had more to do with waging political battles at the excuse of history. Michael Witzel noted him to be a revisionist and part of a &quot;closely knit, self-adulatory group&quot;, members of which often write together and/or profusely copy from and cite one another, thus rendering the whole scene into a virtually indistinguishable hotchpotch. Garrett G. Fagan, a noted critic of pseudoarchaeology has concurred with Witzel. Meera Nanda writes about Kak being revered as a stalwart of Hindutva and one of the leading &quot;intellectual Kshatriyas&quot;. Similar concerns of his being a Hindutva-based revisionist have been echoed by other writers. In a critique of faulty scientific reasoning in Hindutva ideologies and theories, Alan Sokal sarcastically criticized Kak as &quot;one of the leading intellectual luminaries of the Hindu-nationalist diaspora&quot;. Koertge as well as Meera Nanda have remarked that Kak&#x27;s work advances a Hindutva-based esoteric pseudoscience narrative that seeks to find relatively advanced abstract physics in Vedic texts and assign Indian indigenousness to the Sanskrit-speaking Indic Aryans in a bid to prove the superiority of the ancient Hindu civilization.

<doc id="276602" wikidata="Q919017" url="?curid=276602" title="Guna Yala">
<text>Guna Yala, also known as Kuna Yala or by its former name San Blas, is a &quot;comarca indígena&quot; (indigenous province) in northeast Panama. Guna Yala is home to the indigenous people known as the Gunas. Its capital is Gaigirgordub. It is bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea, on the south by the Darién Province and Emberá-Wounaan, on the east by Colombia, and on the west by the province of Colón.

32,016 people lived here in 2023, with over 95% of them being indigenous peoples.

==Etymology==
Guna Yala in Kuna means &quot;Land Guna&quot; or &quot;Guna Mountain&quot;. The area was formerly known as San Blas, and later as Kuna Yala, but the name was changed in October 2011 to &quot;Guna Yala&quot; when the Government of Panama recognized the claim of the people that &quot;Guna&quot; was a closer representation of the name.

== History ==
The area was the site of the conquistador stronghold of Acla, where Vasco Núñez de Balboa was tried and beheaded.

When the Spaniards arrived in the 1600s, the Kuna people were living here near the Gulf of Urabá, in what is considered Colombia today. However, contact with the Spaniards resulted in significant violence and limited trade. The Kuna fled towards the Darién region, what is considered Panama today. They initially began to live along the rivers which flowed into the Caribbean, however as early as the mid 1800s they began to relocate out onto islands near the mouths of freshwater rivers. This sheltered them from illnesses, snakes and mosquitos. Living on the islands also connected them to the coastal trade, forest products, coconuts and turtle-shell. It also gave the Kuna access to trade vessels travelling along coastal routes. They lived in this way on the islands, and maintained their farms on the mainland. Until the mid-nineteenth century this region remained relatively peaceful.

In the late 1690s, the Darien scheme in the Kingdom of Scotland attempted to create an overseas colony in the region, hoping to open an overland route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, almost two centuries prior to the opening of the Panama Canal. They founded the town of New Edinburgh on a bay they named the Bay of Caledonia (a few kilometres southeast of modern Ustupo), as the capital of a new colony to be named &quot;Caledonia&quot; after the Latin name for Scotland. A combination of poor planning, famine, tropical disease and collusion between the East India Company and the Kingdom of England to frustrate the scheme led to the failure of the colony and the death of the majority of the colonists. The town finally surrendered to a siege and blockade of the port by forces of the Spanish Empire in March 1700, and the few survivors were evacuated. Of the 2,500 colonists who had left Scotland, barely a few hundred returned. This costly and high-profile failure caused the bankruptcy of the Scottish government and was a major contributory factor in weakening resistance to the loss of Scottish sovereignty to London through the Act of Union less than a decade later.

By the Colombian Act of June 4, 1870 Tulenega Shire was created, which also included the present territory of the Guna Yala district; this comprises some of the communities of the District of Wargandí such as Mordi, and Sogubdi Asnadi; the communities of the region of Madungandi including Tiuarsicuá, and Guna communities of Colombia, such as Tanela and Arquía. The land area of the Tulenega Shire stretched from the province of Colon to the Gulf of Urabá, Colombia. The head of regional government was generally a commissioner appointed by the central government. The law also recognized the Guna as property owners of the Shire.

After separation of Panama in 1903, the Act of 1870 was ignored. The territory of the former region was divided de facto into two parts: the majority remained in the new Republic of Panama, while a small portion remained in Colombia.

The suspension of the region, the incursions of outsiders into Guna villages in search of gold, rubber, and sea turtles, banana concessions, and colonial police abuse caused great discontent among the natives and brought the February 25, 1925 Guna Revolution, led by Nele Kantule of the town of Ustupu and Ologintipipilele (Simral Colman) of Ailigandi. The armed Guna attacked the police on the islands and Ugupseni Tupile, as the police were accused of abuses and suppressing Guna customs in several communities. The Guna proclaimed the independent Republic of Tule, separating from the central government of Panama for a few days.

The subsequent peace treaty established the commitment of the Government of Panama to protecting the customs of the Guna. The Guna, in turn, accepted the development of a formal school system in the islands. The police brigade would be expelled from their territory and all prisoners released. The negotiations that ended the armed conflict constituted a first step towards establishing the autonomous status of the Guna and maintaining the culture that was being suppressed.

Based on Article 5 of the Constitution of 1904, which allows for special political divisions for reasons of administrative convenience or public service, legislation on indigenous territories in Panama established the Guna District of San Blas in 1938 including areas of the provinces of Panamá and Colón. Its boundaries and administration were finalized by Act No. 16 of 1953.

Currently, according to the ruling of the Supreme Court of 23 March 2001, the region has a different political and administrative organization, independent of the Districts and Villages. The counties are governed by special institutions themselves, and by resolution of Division of the Supreme Court, on 6 December 2000, an institution is the consent of indigenous peoples who wish to develop projects in their territories.

The Colombian political activist Jaime Bateman Cayón, founder and leader of the M-19 movement, died in Guna Yala in 1983.

Governor Erick Martelo was removed from office in September 2020 after being found traveling in a car with 75 packages of illegal drugs.

== Government and politics ==
The governmental structure of Guna Yala is defined in Law 16 of 1953. The General Congress Guna is the highest political authority of Guna Yala. It consists of representatives of all communities in Guna Yala, and meets twice a year. Votes are taken by each sahila (elected leader) of the community.

== Political subdivisions of Guna Yala ==
Guna Yala is politically subdivided into four &quot;corregimientos&quot; (districts), with a total of 51 &quot;comunidades&quot; (communities), most of which are located on islands of the San Blas Archipelago off the mainland coast. They are listed from west to east:

== Geography ==
The Guna District of Yala or Guna Yala Region has an area of . It consists of a narrow strip of land of long on the east coast of Caribbean Panama, bordering the province of Darién and Colombia. An archipelago of 365 islands is around the coast, of which 50 are inhabited.

By boat, going from the most southeastern point, Puerto Obaldia, to the most northwestern point, Gaigirgordub, is a bit more than 100 miles.

The region lies on the north coast of Panama, situated east of the Panama canal, but also nearby the border into Colombia. It is situated conveniently near canal routes, and is a well known area for sailing. The islands however, are at risk of becoming uninhabitable by the late 21st century due to rising sea levels.

== Economy ==
The economy of Guna Yala is mainly agriculture, fishing, tourism, and handicraft production.

Agriculture in Guna Yala is for subsistence purposes. Traditional products are bananas (now the Chinese banana), corn, and sugar cane. Coconuts are also produced as a source of income.

The fishery is artisanal, usually using wire (line) or networks. Most fishing is for sale. The seafood is especially intended for sale, for which planes come daily to the islands. Sold are lobster, crab, squid, and octopus.

The production of molas is the main activity of Guna women, and is for many families the principal source of income.

There are tourist facilities in Guna Yala. Most are small hotels for ecotourism. Most of them are in the field of Gardi, but there are also several in the township of Agligandi.

Another source of income is remittances from relatives working in the cities of Panama and Colon.

== Customs and traditions ==
Among the most important traditions of the Guna people there are:

&quot;Iggo inna&quot;, or &quot;Feast of the Needle&quot; in lack of a more accurate translation, is the feast of puberty where a young girl after her first menstruation participates in a party. 

Children between 4 and 5 take part in ceremony of &quot;inna suid&quot; or Baptism. It involves their first haircut, which is attended by all the people in the community. This name is next to the name given in the country&#x27;s official language.

The Night Festival or &quot;inna mutiki&quot; is a party where all the people get involved in the celebration of a wedding or a new marriage in the community. This festival usually lasts several days until the liquor stock garnered by the families is finished.

== Demographics ==
The Guna District of Yala has a population of 31,557 inhabitants (2010), which shows a progressive decrease in the population.

== Guna Revolution ==
The Guna Revolution refers to the events in 1925, in which the Guna Indians fought the ruling Panamanian authorities, who were attempting to force the Indians to adopt Hispanic culture by military action. During this revolution the Guna Yala territory seceded and operated as the short-lived Republic of Tule. Following mediation by the United States, the Guna re-united with Panama. The Gunas, with the support of the Panamanian government, created an autonomous territory called the Guna Yala district for the indigenous inhabitants which they would rule themselves.

=== Background ===
During the first twenty years of the independent country of Panama, the Kuna had serious differences with national governments, because they tried to eradicate their culture, their customs, and their disrespect, indigenous authorities wanted to strip the land apart and were outraged by the governors and the colonial police (a settler to a native, is a non-Indian).
This is linked to an incident on April 20, 1921, which was staged in the Corazón de Jesús Narganá and Westernization movement for women, which was to change clothes, take away the gold ring of the nose, the plates high carat gold, beads, winks, and coin necklaces worn as ornaments. But a woman escaped and fled to Rio Narganá Sugar, from which it came. The police in retaliation imprisoned his children and his son, who was released to the outside to look.

That day at Sugar River had an indigenous congress and there it was decided not to let the woman go, so the sahila on behalf of the community sent a message saying that the police were not looking for it. The police did not heed the message that night and sent a commission to Rio Colonial Sugar two police officers and three Indians. When trying to stop some of the male relatives of women, began the battle and killed three residents of the town, two Indian policemen and others were injured with machete wildly as they fled in a canoe. The bodies of the policemen were left in the water, tied to a stick in the sand enlcavado until they came to collect their families.

The atmosphere remained tense until January 1925. Juan Demosthenes Arosemena was the governor of the province of Colon, and was concerned about the information he had supplied the mayor of San Blas, Andrés Mojica, on a course between the indigenous independence movement, so we decided to tell the Foreign Secretary Horacio F. Alfaro, to follow closely the actions of Americans Anne Coope, missionary, and explorer Richard Oglesby Marsh.
Just Marsh was the promoter of independence. On his return to Panama in January 1925, he found a conflict between police and indigenous ready to explode, so he asked the U.S. military intervention in the Canal Zone, to exercise a protectorate, and wrote the Declaration of Independence and Tule people&#x27;s human rights and Darién. Marsh was supported by the U.S. ambassador, who helped the Panamanian government establish a peace agreement that would guarantee human rights and political rights of 
Guna.

=== Revolution ===
The situation worsened until February 12, 1925, in a conference held in Ailigandi, where he met top leaders of 45 villages and tribes. The conference lasted 26 days, proclaiming the Republic of Tule, and fixing territorial limits.
This uprising was under a flag was made by Waga Ebinkili (Mary Colman), granddaughter of Chief Simral Colman. It had a rectangular design with stripes. The center was yellow with the upper and lower stripes in red and with a figure of left facing swastika.
On February 21, 10 days after the declaration of independence, in the midst of the Carnival, indigenous revolution broke out that lasted until 27 February, which was led by Nele Gantule and chief Colman. It is said that the insurgents were traveling in canoes from indigenous and Carti Ailigandi for the purpose of attacking the National Police headquarters in Playon Chico, Río Tigre, Tigantigí, Narganá, UGAP and elsewhere in the archipelago, and carried much of the police contingent. The toll was 27 dead.

On 4 March, with the presence of the American minister, John G. South, was signed the peace agreement with the Guna, who were promised a better deal, respect for their customs, not to impose the establishment of schools, and were assured the same protection and rights enjoyed by other citizens. The Guna, in turn, pledged to lay down their weapons, withdraw their declaration of independence, and abide by the laws of Panama.

<text>New York Harbor is a bay that covers all of the Upper Bay and an extremely small portion of the Lower Bay. It is at the mouth of the Hudson River where it empties into New York/New Jersey Bight near the East River tidal estuary, and then into the Atlantic Ocean on the East Coast of the United States.

New York Harbor is also known as Upper New York Bay, which is enclosed by the New York City boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island and the Hudson County, New Jersey, municipalities of Jersey City and Bayonne. The name may also refer to the entirety of New York Bay including Lower New York Bay. New York Harbor is one of the largest natural harbors in the world.

== Overview ==
The harbor is fed by the waters of the Hudson River (historically called the North River as it passes Manhattan), as well as the Gowanus Canal. It is connected to Lower New York Bay by the Narrows, to Newark Bay by the Kill Van Kull, and to Long Island Sound by the East River, which, despite its name, is actually a tidal strait. It provides the main passage for the waters of the Hudson River as it empties through the Narrows. The channel of the Hudson as it passes through the harbor is called the Anchorage Channel and is approximately 50 feet deep in the midpoint of the harbor.

A project to replace two water mains between Brooklyn and Staten Island, which will eventually allow for dredging of the channel to nearly , was begun in April 2012.

The harbor contains several islands including Governors Island, near the mouth of the East River, as well Ellis Island, Liberty Island, and Robbins Reef which are supported by a large underwater reef on the New Jersey side of the harbor. The reef was historically one of the largest oyster beds in the world and provided a staple for the diet of all classes of citizens both locally and regionally until the end of the 19th century, when the beds succumbed to pollution.

Historically, it has played an extremely important role in the commerce of the New York metropolitan area. The Statue of Liberty National Monument recalls the immigrant experience during the late 19th and early 20th century.

Since the 1950s, container ship traffic has been primarily routed through the Kill Van Kull to Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, where it is consolidated for easier automated transfer to land conveyance. As a consequence, the waterfront industries of the Harbor experienced a decline leading to diverse plans for revitalization, though important maritime uses remain at Red Hook, Port Jersey, MOTBY, Constable Hook, and parts of the Staten Island shore. Liberty State Park opened in 1976. In recent years, it has become a popular site for recreation sailing and kayaking.

The harbor is traversed by the Staten Island Ferry, which runs between Whitehall Street at the southernmost tip of Manhattan near Battery Park (South Ferry) and St. George Ferry Terminal on Richmond Terrace in Staten Island near Richmond County Borough Hall and Richmond County Supreme Court. NY Waterway operates routes across the bay and through The Narrows to locations near Sandy Hook.

The harbor supports a very diverse population of marine species, allowing for recreational fishing, most commonly for striped bass and bluefish.

==History==
===Colonial era===

The original population of the 16th century New York Harbor, the Lenape, used the waterways for fishing and travel. In 1524 Giovanni da Verrazzano anchored in what is now called the Narrows, the strait between Staten Island and Long Island that connects the Upper and Lower New York Bay, where he received a canoe party of Lenape. A party of his sailors may have taken on fresh water at a spring called &quot;the watering place&quot; on Staten Island—a monument stands in a tiny park on the corner of Bay Street and Victory Boulevard at the approximate spot—but Verrazzano&#x27;s descriptions of the geography of the area are a bit ambiguous. It is fairly firmly held by historians that his ship anchored at the approximate location of the modern Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge&#x27;s approach viaduct in Brooklyn. He also observed what he believed to be a large freshwater lake to the north (apparently Upper New York Bay). He apparently did not travel north to observe the existence of the Hudson River. In 1609 Henry Hudson entered the Harbor and explored a stretch of the river that now bears his name. His journey prompted others to explore the region and engage in trade with the local population.

The first permanent European settlement was started on Governors Island in 1624, and in Brooklyn eight years after that; soon these were connected by ferry operation.
The colonial Dutch Director-General of New Netherland, Peter Stuyvesant, ordered construction of the first wharf on the Manhattan bank of the lower East River sheltered from winds and ice, which was completed late in 1648 and called Schreyers Hook Dock (near what is now Pearl and Broad Streets). This prepared New York as a leading port for the British colonies and then within the newly independent United States.

In 1686, the British colonial officials gave the municipality control over the waterfront.

===19th century===

In 1835, Lieutenant Thomas Gedney of the Survey of the Coast (renamed the United States Coast Survey in 1836 and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1878) discovered a new, deeper channel through the Narrows into New York Harbor. Previously, the passage was complex and shallow enough that loaded ships would wait outside the harbor until high tide, to avoid running into the huge sandbar, which was interrupted in a number of places by channels of fairly shallow depth: at low tide and at high tide. Because of the difficulty of the navigation required, since 1694, New York had required all ships to be guided into the harbor by an experienced pilot. The new channel Gedney discovered was deeper, enough of an added margin that fully laden ships could come into the harbor even at slack tide. Gedney&#x27;s Channel, as it came to be called, was also shorter than the previous channel, another benefit appreciated by the ship owners and the merchants they sold to. Gedney received the praise of the city, as well as an expensive silver service.

In her 1832 book &quot;Domestic Manners of the Americans&quot;, Fanny Trollope wrote of her impressions upon entering New York Harbor for the first time:

I have never seen the bay of Naples, I can therefore make no comparison, but my imagination is incapable of conceiving any thing of the kind more beautiful than the harbour of New York. Various and lovely are the objects which meet the eye on every side, but the naming them would only be to give a list of words, without conveying the faintest idea of the scene. I doubt if ever the pencil of Turner could do it justice, bright and glorious as it rose upon us. We seemed to enter the harbour of New York upon waves of liquid gold, and as we darted past the green isles which rise from its bosom, like guardian centinels of the fair city, the setting sun stretched his horizontal beams farther and farther at each moment, as if to point out to us some new glory in the landscape.

In 1824 the first American drydock was completed on the East River. Because of its location and depth, the Port grew rapidly with the introduction of steamships; and then with the completion in 1825 of the Erie Canal New York became the most important transshipping port between Europe and the interior of the United States, as well as coastwise destinations. By about 1840, more passengers and a greater tonnage of cargo came through the port of New York than all other major harbors in the country combined and by 1900 it was one of the great international ports. The Morris Canal carried anthracite and freight from Pennsylvania through New Jersey to its terminus at the mouth of the Hudson in Jersey City. Portions in the harbor are now part of Liberty State Park.

In 1870, the city established the Department of Docks to systematize waterfront development, with George B. McClellan as the first engineer in chief. By the turn of the 20th century numerous railroad terminals lined the western banks of the North River (Hudson River) in Hudson County, New Jersey, transporting passengers and freight from all over the United States. The freight was ferried across by the competing railroads with small fleets of towboats, barges, and 323 car floats, specially designed barges with rails so cars could be rolled on. New York subsidized this service which undercut rival ports. Major road improvements allowing for trucking and containerization diminished the need.

The harbor saw major federal investment at the end of the century when Congress passed the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. Over $1.2 million of initial funding was appropriated for the dredging of 40-foot-deep (12.2 m) channels at Bay Ridge, Red Hook, and Sandy Hook.

The Statue of Liberty (&quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;) stands on Liberty Island in the harbor, while the nearby main port of entry at Ellis Island processed 12 million arrivals from 1892 to 1954. The Statue of Liberty National Monument, encompassing both islands, recalls the period of massive immigration to the United States at the turn of the 20th century While many stayed in the region, others spread across America, with more than 10 million leaving from the nearby Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal.

===20th century===

==== Post–World War I ====
After the war, the 1919 New York City Harbor Strike by the Marine Workers Union shut down the port for weeks.

It started on January 9 and was paused on January 13 for arbitration. The strike resumed March 4 after workers rejected the War Board labor ruling and ended on April 20, 1919 after new terms had been offered by both public and private port employers.
====World War II====

After the United States entered World War II, the German navy&#x27;s Operation Drumbeat set the top U-boat aces loose against the merchant fleet in U.S. territorial waters in January 1942, starting the Second happy time. The U-boat captains were able to silhouette target ships against the glow of city lights, and attacked with relative impunity, in spite of U.S. naval concentrations within the Harbor. Casualties included the tankers &quot;Coimbria&quot; off Sandy Hook and &quot;Norness&quot; off Long Island. New York Harbor, as the major convoy embarkation point for the U.S., was effectively a staging area in the Battle of the Atlantic, with the U.S. Merchant Marine losses of 1 of 26 mariners, a rate exceeding those of the other U.S. forces.

Bright city lights made it easier for German U-boats to spot targets at night, but local officials resisted suggestions that they follow London&#x27;s lead and blackout the lights of coastal cities. However, some lights were darkened, including those of the amusement parks in Coney Island, Brooklyn, and the Coney Island Light, and Sandy Hook Lighthouse.

The Harbor reached its peak activity in March 1943 during World War II, with 543 ships at anchor awaiting assignment to convoy or berthing (with as many as 426 seagoing vessel already at one of the 750 piers or docks). Eleven hundred warehouses with nearly of enclosed space served freight along with 575 tugboats and 39 active shipyards, the largest being Brooklyn Navy Yard. With a large inventory of heavy equipment, this made New York Harbor the busiest in the world.

==== Post–World War II ====
Deterrence and investigation of criminal activity, especially relating to organized crime, is the responsibility of the bi-state Waterfront Commission. The commission was set up in 1953 (a year before the movie &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;), to combat labor racketeering. It is held that the Gambino crime family controlled the New York waterfront and the Genovese crime family controlled the New Jersey side. In 1984 the Teamsters local was put under Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) trusteeship, and in 2005 a similar suit was brought against the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association local.

In March 2006, the Port passenger facility was to be transferred to Dubai Ports World. There was considerable security controversy over the ownership by a foreign corporation, particularly Arabic, of a U.S. port operation, this in spite of the fact the current operator was the British-based P&amp;O Ports, and the fact that Orient Overseas Investment Limited, a company dominated by a Chinese Communist official, has the operating contract for Howland Hook Marine Terminal. An additional concern is the U.S. Customs &quot;green lane&quot; program, in which trusted shippers have fewer containers inspected, providing easier access for contraband material.

==Water quality==
The water quality in New York Harbor has been affected by centuries of shipping activity, industrial development and urbanization. Water pollution from these sources has been a constant phenomenon, although there have been improvements in some areas of the harbor complex in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. A 2019 study of the harbor identifies water quality trends in nine regions of the harbor, using data collected during 1996 to 2017. The Lower New York Bay region has the highest quality, due to frequent exchange of water with the Atlantic Ocean. The poorest regions are those with limited exchange of water flows: Newtown Creek, Flushing Bay and Jamaica Bay. High levels of nutrient pollution (nitrogen and phosphorus) were observed throughout the various harbor regions, although there has been a general lowering trend in total nitrogen, and some other indicator parameters show improvements. The implementation of the Clean Water Act and related pollution control laws, along with cleanup programs and conservation measures throughout the region, have begun to yield some improvements since the 1970s. The study authors state that &quot;the New York Harbor ecosystem is much healthier than it was 30 years ago.&quot;

==Container shipping and air travel==

The Port of New York and New Jersey is the largest oil importing port and third largest container port in the nation. The commercial activity of the port of New York City, including the waterfronts of the five boroughs and nearby cities in New Jersey, since 1921 has been formalized under a single bi-state Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Since the 1950s, the New York and Brooklyn commercial port has been almost completely eclipsed by the container ship facility at nearby Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal in Newark Bay, which is the largest such port on the Eastern Seaboard. The port has diminished in importance to passenger travel, but the Port Authority operates all three major airports, La Guardia (built 1939) and JFK/Idlewild (built 1948) in New York, and Newark (built 1928) in New Jersey.

==Ferries and cruise ships==
The harbor is still served by cruise lines, commuter ferries, and tourist excursion boats. Although most ferry service is private, the Staten Island Ferry is operated by the New York City Department of Transportation. Passenger ship facilities are New York Passenger Ship Terminal, the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal at Red Hook, and MOTBY at Bayonne.

<text>The fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) is a medium-sized wild cat of South and Southeast Asia. It has a deep yellowish-grey fur with black lines and spots. Adults have a head-to-body length of , with a long tail. Males are larger than females, weighing , while females average . It lives mostly in the vicinity of wetlands, along rivers, streams, oxbow lakes, in swamps and mangroves where it preys mostly on fish. Other prey items include birds, insects, small rodents, molluscs, reptiles including snakes, amphibians and carrion of cattle. The fishing cat is thought to be primarily nocturnal. It is a good swimmer and can swim long distances, even underwater.

The fishing cat has been listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List since 2016, as the global population is thought to have declined by about 30% in the past three fishing cat generations during the period 2010–2015. The destruction of wetlands and killing by local people are the major threats throughout its range. It is the state animal of West Bengal.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Felis viverrinus&quot; was proposed by Edward Turner Bennett in 1833, who described a cat skin sent from India by Josiah Marshall Heath. The genus name &quot;Prionailurus&quot; was proposed by Nikolai Severtzov in 1858 for spotted wild cats native to Asia. A subspecies &quot;Felis viverrinus rhizophoreus&quot; was proposed in 1936 by , who described a specimen from the north coast of West Java that had a slightly shorter skull than fishing cat specimens from Thailand. There is evidence that the nominate taxon and the Javan fishing cat are distinguishable by skull morphometrics.

=== Phylogeny ===
Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear DNA in tissue samples from all Felidae species revealed that the evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia in the Miocene around . Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at around .

The &quot;Prionailurus&quot; species are estimated to have had a common ancestor between , and .
Both models agree in the rusty-spotted cat (&quot;P. rubiginosus&quot;) having been the first cat of the &quot;Prionailurus&quot; lineage that genetically diverged, followed by the flat-headed cat (&quot;P. planiceps&quot;) and then the fishing cat. It is estimated to have diverged together with the leopard cat (&quot;P. bengalensis&quot;) between and .
The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic relationships of the fishing cat as derived through analysis of nuclear DNA:

== Characteristics ==

The fishing cat has a deep yellowish-grey fur with black lines and spots. Two stripes are on the cheeks, and two are above the eyes running to the neck with broken lines on the forehead. It has two rows of spots around the throat. The spots on the shoulder are longitudinal, and those on the sides, limbs and tail are roundish. The background colour of its fur varies between individuals from yellowish tawny to ashy grey, and the size of the stripes ranges from narrow to broad. The fur on the belly is lighter than on the back and sides. The short and rounded ears are set low on the head, and the back of the ears bear a white spot. The tail is short, less than half the length of head and body, and with a few black rings at the end. The short dense layered fur is thought to be an aquatic adaptation providing a water barrier and thermal insulation, while another layer of protruding long guard hairs provides its pattern and glossy sheen.

The fishing cat is the largest cat of the &quot;Prionailurus&quot;. It is stocky and muscular with a head-to-body length ranging from , a tail length of and medium to short legs. Females weigh and males , showing pronounced sexual dimorphism. Its skull is elongated, with a basal length of and a post-orbital width of . Its tongue is about long and has large, cylindrical papillae near the front.

Fishing cat paws are partly webbed, and the claws are incompletely sheathed, only becoming partially covered when fully retracted. It is about twice the size of a domestic cat.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The fishing cat is broadly but discontinuously distributed in South and Southeast Asia. It predominantly inhabits densely vegetated wetlands around slow-moving bodies of water like swamps and marshes. These include low-salinity bodies such as oxbow lakes, and high-salinity ones such as tidal creeks and mangrove forests. Along these bodies of water, it conceals itself within the thick cover of forests, scrublands, reed beds, and grasslands. Most records are from lowland areas.

In Pakistan&#x27;s Sindh Province, the fishing cat was recorded in the Chotiari Dam area in 2012. In the Nepal Terai, it has been recorded in Shuklaphanta, Bardia, Chitwan and Parsa National Parks and in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve. In India, its presence has been documented in Ranthambore National Park, in Pilibhit, Dudhwa and Valmiki Tiger Reserves, in Sur Sarovar Bird Sanctuary, outside protected areas in West Bengal, in Lothian Island Wildlife Sanctuary in the Sundarbans, in Odisha&#x27;s Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary and coastal districts outside protected areas, in Andhra Pradesh&#x27;s Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary, Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary and adjoining reserve forests. Reports in Bangladeshi newspapers indicate that fishing cats live in most divisions of Bangladesh. In Sri Lanka, it has been recorded in tea estates, Maduru Oya National Park and multiple localities in coastal to hilly regions.

In Myanmar, it was recorded in the Ayeyarwady Delta in 2016 and 2018. In Thailand, its presence has been documented in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area and in Kaeng Krachan National Park. Between 2007 and 2016, it was also recorded near wetlands outside protected areas in Phitsanulok Province, Bang Khun Thian District, Samut Sakhon, Phetchaburi and Songkhla Provinces, and near a mangrove site in Pattani. In Cambodia, a single fishing cat was photographed by a camera trap in Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in March 2003. In 2015, it was also recorded in Peam Krasop Wildlife Sanctuary and Ream National Park. The island of Java constitutes the southern limit of the fishing cat&#x27;s range, but by the 1990s fishing cats were thought to be scarce and restricted to tidal forests with sandy or muddy shores, older mangrove stands, and abandoned mangrove plantation areas with fishponds. There are no confirmed records in Peninsular Malaysia, Vietnam and Laos.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
The fishing cat lives among dense vegetation near water and is thought to be primarily nocturnal. It is known to be a proficient long-distance and underwater swimmer. Adult males and females without dependent young are solitary. Females have been reported to range over areas of , while males range over . It has been observed resting in thick grassy habitats, often near a water body but sometimes far away from them. Adults have been recorded to vocalise &quot;chuckling&quot; sounds.
It marks its home range using cheek-rubbing, head rubbing, chin rubbing, neck rubbing and urine-spraying to leave scent marks; it also sharpens its claws and displays flehmen. The pungent smell of fishing cat urine markings is due to 3-Mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol, a breakdown product of felinine.

Fishing cat feces collected in India&#x27;s Keoladeo National Park revealed that fish comprises about three-quarter of its diet, with the remainder consisting of birds, small rodents and insects; molluscs, reptiles, amphibians, carrion of cattle and grass supplement its diet. Its main prey in the Godavari River delta is fish, including flathead grey mullet, green chromide and Mozambique tilapia, which comprised three fifths of its diet, whereas rodents and crabs made up the remainder of the diet. The diet make-up remained relatively constant throughout the year. Fishing cats have been observed while hunting along the edges of watercourses, grabbing prey from the water, and sometimes diving into the water to catch prey further from the banks. It prefers hunting in shallow water and spends about half the time lying in wait for prey to approach.

=== Reproduction and development ===
Wild fishing cats most likely mate during January and February; most kittens in the wild were observed in March and April. However, fishing cats may mate as late as June. In captivity, the gestation period lasts 63–70 days; females give birth to an average of two to three kittens; the litter size can be as small as one to as large as four. Kittens weigh around at birth and are able to actively move around by the age of one month. They begin to play in water and to take solid food when about two months old, but are not fully weaned until six months old. They reach full adult size when about eight and a half months old, acquire their adult canine teeth by 11 months and are sexually mature when approximately 15 months old. They live up to 10 years in captivity. The generation length of the fishing cat is five years.

=== Health===
Fishing cats are susceptible to carnivore protoparvovirus, a disease known to kill them. This disease significantly damages the kidney, spleen and gastrointestinal tract of the body. The fishing cat is also vulnerable to diseases and medical conditions such as feline hemoplasmas, transitional cell carcinoma and canine distemper virus. One captive individual was even recorded with chlamydiota. Additionally, in a 2012 case study, &quot;Toxocara cati&quot; was reported as the cause of death of young captive fishing cats.

== Threats ==
Since 2016, the fishing cat is listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List, as the global population is thought to have declined by around 30% in the years 2010–2015; the destruction of wetlands and killings by local people are major threats to the fishing cat.
The destruction of wetlands includes increased pollution or conversion for agricultural use and human settlements. The conversion of mangrove forests to commercial aquaculture ponds is a major threat in Andhra Pradesh, and in some places fishing cats are killed. Over-exploitation of local fish stocks and retaliatory killing by local people are also significant threats. The fishing cat&#x27;s habitat in India is predominantly marshlands, which are subject to agricultural usage under the country&#x27;s laws, resulting in human–wildlife conflict. Coastal wetlands are an important habitat for the fishing cat in Thailand and Cambodia, however, estimates predict that only 6% of wetlands remain undisturbed.

In West Bengal&#x27;s Howrah district, 27 dead fishing cats were recorded between April 2010 and May 2011, and in Sagar Island, the fishing cat was possibly extirpated by local people for reasons unknown. Deaths are more frequent in the dry season, when people use wetlands more frequently. At least 30 fishing cats were killed by local people in Bangladesh between January 2010 and March 2013. They are often killed because they are mistaken as tiger cubs. In Thailand, 31% of radio-collared fishing cats were killed by local people between 2012 and 2015. Fish farmers in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve have killed fishing cats in retaliation for perceived loss of fish. Roadkills are a major mortality factor in Odisha. The fishing cat is possibly extinct in coastal Kerala, but it is doubtful whether it ever occurred there at all.

== Conservation ==
The fishing cat is included on CITES Appendix II and protected by national legislation over most of its range. Hunting is prohibited in Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Hunting regulations apply in Laos. In Bhutan, Malaysia, and Vietnam, it is not protected outside protected areas, and no information is known about its legal protections in Cambodia. It is the state animal of the Indian state of West Bengal. Its survival depends on protection of wetlands, prevention of indiscriminate trapping, snaring and poisoning.

In areas where habitat degradation is a major concern, such as coastal Andhra Pradesh, NGOs are working to slow habitat conversion in collaboration with local villagers. Part of this work involves creating alternative livelihood programs that allow villagers to earn money without damaging natural habitats. A Fishing Cat Conservation Alliance provides an umbrella for the cooperation of national fishing cat conservation groups, which began with the establishment of India&#x27;s in 2010.

Fishing cat captive breeding programmes have been established by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria and the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums. All the fishing cats kept in zoos around the world are listed in the International Studbook of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Zoos in Thailand house around 30 individuals; birth rates are not particularly high. They have been placed in captivity as an &quot;insurance population&quot; due to their vulnerable status in the wild.

<doc id="276629" wikidata="Q903516" url="?curid=276629" title="George Crabbe">
<text>George Crabbe ( ; 24 December 1754 – 3 February 1832) was an English poet, surgeon and clergyman. He is best known for his early use of the realistic narrative form and his descriptions of middle and working-class life and people.

In the 1770s, Crabbe began his career as a doctor&#x27;s apprentice, later becoming a surgeon. In 1780, he travelled to London to make a living as a poet. After encountering serious financial difficulty and being unable to have his work published, he wrote to the statesman and author Edmund Burke for assistance. Burke was impressed enough by Crabbe&#x27;s poems to promise to help him in any way he could. The two became close friends and Burke helped Crabbe greatly both in his literary career and in building a role within the church.

Burke introduced Crabbe to the literary and artistic society of London, including Sir Joshua Reynolds and Samuel Johnson, who read &quot;The Village&quot; before its publication and made some minor changes. Burke secured Crabbe the important position of Chaplain to the Duke of Rutland. Crabbe served as a clergyman in various capacities for the rest of his life, with Burke&#x27;s continued help in securing these positions. He developed friendships with many of the great literary men of his day, including Sir Walter Scott, whom he visited in Edinburgh, and William Wordsworth and some of his fellow Lake Poets, who frequently visited Crabbe as his guests.

Lord Byron described him as &quot;nature&#x27;s sternest painter, yet the best.&quot; Crabbe&#x27;s poetry was predominantly in the form of heroic couplets, and has been described as unsentimental in its depiction of provincial life and society. The modern critic Frank Whitehead wrote that &quot;Crabbe, in his verse tales in particular, is an important—indeed, a major—poet whose work has been and still is seriously undervalued.&quot; Crabbe&#x27;s works include &quot;The Village&quot; (1783), &quot;Poems&quot; (1807), &quot;The Borough&quot; (1810), and his poetry collections &quot;Tales&quot; (1812) and &quot;Tales of the Hall&quot; (1819).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Crabbe was born in Aldeburgh, Suffolk, the eldest child of George Crabbe Sr. The elder George Crabbe had been a teacher at a village school in Orford, Suffolk, and later in Norton, near Loddon, Norfolk; he later became a tax collector for salt duties, a position that his own father had held. As a young man he married an older widow named Craddock, who became the mother of his six children: George, his brothers Robert, John, and William, his sister Mary, and another sister who died as an infant.

George Jr. spent his first 25 years close to his birthplace. He showed an aptitude for books and learning at an early age. He was sent to school while still very young, and developed an interest in the stories and ballads that were popular among his neighbours. His father owned a few books, and used to read passages from John Milton and from various 18th-century poets to his family. He also subscribed to Benjamin Martin&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;, giving the &quot;poet&#x27;s corner&quot; section to George. The senior Crabbe had interests in the local fishing industry, and owned a fishing boat; he had contemplated raising his son George to be a seaman, but soon found that the boy was unsuited to such a career.

George&#x27;s father respected his son&#x27;s interest in literature, and George was sent first to a boarding-school at Bungay near his home, and a few years later to a more important school at Stowmarket, where he gained an understanding of mathematics and Latin, and a familiarity with the Latin classics. His early reading included the works of William Shakespeare, Alexander Pope, who had a great influence on George&#x27;s future works, Abraham Cowley, Sir Walter Raleigh and Edmund Spenser. He spent three years at Stowmarket before leaving school to find a medical apprenticeship.

In 1768 Crabbe was apprenticed to an apothecary at Wickhambrook, near Bury St Edmunds; the apothecary also kept a small farm, and he ended up doing farm labour and errands, rather than medical work. In 1771 he changed masters and moved to Woodbridge. There he was under the surgeon John Page. He remained until 1775.

While at Woodbridge, Crabbe joined a small club of young men who met at an inn for evening discussions. Through his contacts there he met his future wife, Sarah Elmy. Crabbe called her &quot;Mira&quot;, later referring to her by this name in some of his poems. During this time he began writing poetry. In 1772, a ladies&#x27; magazine offered a prize for the best poem on the subject of hope, which Crabbe won. The same magazine printed other short pieces of Crabbe&#x27;s throughout 1772. They were signed &quot;G. C., Woodbridge,&quot; and included some of his lyrics addressed to Mira. Other known verses written while he was at Woodbridge show that he made experiments in stanza form modelled on the works of earlier English poets, but only showed some slight imitative skill.

===1775 to 1785===
His first major work, a satirical poem of nearly 400 lines in Pope&#x27;s couplet form entitled &quot;Inebriety&quot;, was self-published in 1775. Crabbe later said of the poem, which received little or no attention at the time, &quot;Pray let not this be seen ... there is very little of it that I&#x27;m not heartily ashamed of.&quot; By this time he had completed his medical training and had returned home to Aldeburgh. He had intended to go on to London to study at a hospital, but he was forced through low finances to work for some time as a local warehouseman. He eventually travelled to London in 1777 to practise medicine, returning home in financial difficulty after a year. He continued to practise as a surgeon after returning to Aldeburgh, but as his surgical skills remained deficient, he attracted only the poorest patients, and his fees were small and undependable. This hurt his chances of an early marriage, but Sarah stayed devoted to him.
In late 1779 he decided to move to London and see if he could make it as a poet, or, if that failed, as a doctor. He moved to London in April 1780, where he had little success, and by the end of May he had been forced to pawn some of his possessions, including his surgical instruments. He composed a number of works but was refused publication. He wrote several letters seeking patronage, but these were also refused. In June Crabbe witnessed instances of mob violence during the Gordon Riots, and recorded them in his journal.
He was able to publish a poem at this time entitled &quot;The Candidate&quot;, but it was badly received by critics.

He continued to rack up debts that he had no way of paying, and his creditors pressed him. He later told Walter Scott and John Gibson Lockhart that &quot;during many months when he was toiling in
early life in London he hardly ever tasted butchermeat except on a Sunday, when he dined usually with
a tradesman&#x27;s family, and thought their leg of mutton, baked in the pan, the perfection of luxury.&quot; In early 1781 he wrote a letter to Edmund Burke asking for help, in which he included samples of his poetry. Burke was swayed by Crabbe&#x27;s letter and a subsequent meeting with him, giving him money to relieve his immediate wants, and assuring him that he would do all in his power to further Crabbe&#x27;s literary career. Among the samples that Crabbe had sent to Burke were pieces of his poems &quot;The Library&quot; and &quot;The Village&quot;.

A short time after their first meeting Burke told his friend Sir Joshua Reynolds that Crabbe had &quot;the mind and feelings of a gentleman.&quot; Burke gave Crabbe the footing of a friend, admitting him to his family circle at Beaconsfield. There he was given an apartment, supplied with books, and made a member of the family. The time he spent with Burke and his family helped by enlarging his knowledge and ideas, and introducing him to many new and valuable friends including Charles James Fox and Samuel Johnson. He completed his unfinished poems and revised others with the help of Burke&#x27;s criticism. Burke helped him have his poem, &quot;The Library&quot;, published anonymously in June 1781, by a publisher that had previously refused some of his work. &quot;The Library&quot; was greeted with modest praise from critics, and slight public appreciation.

Through their friendship, Burke discovered that Crabbe was more suited to be a clergyman than a surgeon. Crabbe had a good knowledge of Latin and an evident natural piety, and was well read in the scriptures. He was ordained to the curacy of his native town on 21 December 1781 through Burke&#x27;s recommendation. He returned to live in Aldeburgh with his sister and father, his mother having died in his absence. Crabbe was surprised to find that he was poorly treated by his fellow townsmen, who resented his rise in social class. With Burke&#x27;s help, Crabbe was able to leave Aldeburgh the next year, to become chaplain to the Duke of Rutland at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire. This was an unusual move on Burke&#x27;s part, as this kind of preferment would usually have been given to a family member or personal friend of the Duke or through political interest.

Crabbe&#x27;s experience as chaplain at Belvoir was not altogether happy. He was treated with kindness by the Duke and Duchess, but his slightly unpolished manners and his position as a literary dependent made his relations with others in the Duke&#x27;s house difficult, especially the servants. However, the Duke and Duchess and many of their noble guests shared an interest in Crabbe&#x27;s literary talent and work. During his time there, his poem &quot;The Village&quot; was published in May 1783, achieving popularity with the public and critics. Samuel Johnson said of the poem in a letter to Reynolds &quot;I have sent you back Mr. Crabbe&#x27;s poem, which I read with great delight. It is original, vigorous, and elegant.&quot; Johnson&#x27;s friend and biographer James Boswell also praised &quot;The Village&quot;. It was said at the time of publication that Johnson had made extensive changes to the poem, but Boswell responded by saying that &quot;the aid given by Johnson to the poem, as to &quot;The Traveller&quot; and &quot;Deserted Village&quot; of Goldsmith, were so small as by no means to impair the distinguished merit of the author.&quot;

Crabbe was able to keep up his friendships with Burke, Reynolds, and others during the Duke&#x27;s occasional visits to London. He visited the theatre, and was impressed with the actresses Sarah Siddons and Dorothea Jordan. Around this time it was decided that, as Chaplain to a noble family, Crabbe was in need of a college degree, and his name was entered on the boards of Trinity College, Cambridge, through the influence of Bishop Watson of Llandaff, so that Crabbe could obtain a degree without residence. This was in 1783, but almost immediately afterwards he received an LL.B. degree from the Archbishop of Canterbury. This degree allowed Crabbe to be given two small livings in Dorsetshire, Frome St Quintin and Evershot. This promotion does not seem to have interfered with Crabbe&#x27;s residence at Belvoir or in London; it is likely that curates were placed in these situations.

On the strength of these preferments and a promise of future assistance from the Duke, Crabbe and Sarah Elmy were married in December 1783, in the parish church of Beccles, where Miss Elmy&#x27;s mother lived, and a few weeks later went to live together at Belvoir Castle. In 1784 the Duke of Rutland became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It was decided that Crabbe was not to be on the Duke&#x27;s staff in Ireland, though the two men parted as close friends. The young couple stayed on at Belvoir for nearly another eighteen months before Crabbe accepted a vacant curacy in the neighbourhood, that of Stathern in Leicestershire, where Crabbe and his wife moved in 1785. A child had been born to them at Belvoir, dying only hours after birth. During the following four years at Stathern they had three other children; two sons, George and John, in 1785 and 1787, and a daughter in 1789, who died in infancy. Crabbe later told his children that his four years at Stathern were the happiest of his life.

===1785 to 1810===
In October 1787 the Duke of Rutland died at the Vice-Regal Lodge in Dublin, after a short illness, at the early age of 35. Crabbe assisted at the funeral at Belvoir. The Duchess, anxious to have their former chaplain close by, was able to get Crabbe the two livings of Muston, Leicestershire, and Allington, Lincolnshire, in exchange for his old livings. Crabbe brought his family to Muston in February 1789. His connection with the two livings lasted for over 25 years, but during 13 of these years he was a non-resident. He stayed three years at Muston. Another son, Edmund, was born in 1790. In 1792, through the death of one of Sarah&#x27;s relations and soon after of her older sister, the Crabbe family came into possession of an estate in Parham in Suffolk, which removed all of their financial worries. Crabbe soon moved his family to this estate. Their son William was born the same year.

Crabbe&#x27;s life at Parham was not happy. The former owner of the estate had been very popular for his hospitality, while Crabbe&#x27;s lifestyle was much more quiet and private. His solace here was the company of his friend Dudley Long North and his fellow Whigs who lived nearby. Crabbe soon sent his two sons George and John to school in Aldeburgh. After four years at Parham, the Crabbes moved to a home in Great Glemham, Suffolk, placed at his disposal by Dudley North. The family remained here for four or five years. In 1796 their third son, Edmund died at the age of six. This was a heavy blow to Sarah who began suffering from a nervous disorder from which she never recovered. Crabbe, a devoted husband, tended her with exemplary care until her death in 1813. Robert Southey, writing about Crabbe to his friend, Neville White, in 1808, said &quot;It was not long before his wife became deranged, and when all this was told me by one who knew him well, five years ago, he was still almost confined in his own house, anxiously waiting upon this wife in her long and hopeless malady. A sad history! It is no wonder that he gives so melancholy a picture of human life.&quot;
During his time at Glemham, Crabbe composed several novels, none of which was published. After Glemham, Crabbe moved to the village of Rendham in Suffolk, where he stayed until 1805. His poem &quot;The Parish Register&quot; was all but completed while at Rendham, and &quot;The Borough&quot; was also begun. 1805 was the last year of Crabbe&#x27;s stay in Suffolk, and it was made memorable in literature by the appearance of the &quot;Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot; by Walter Scott. Crabbe first saw it in a bookseller&#x27;s shop in Ipswich, read it nearly through while standing at the counter, and pronounced that a new and great poet had appeared. In October 1805, Crabbe returned with his wife and two sons to the parsonage at Muston. He had been absent for nearly 13 years, of which four had been spent at Parham, five at Great Glemham, and four at Rendham.

In September 1807, Crabbe published a new volume of poems. Included in this volume were &quot;The Library&quot;, &quot;The Newspaper&quot;, and &quot;The Village&quot;; the principal new poem was &quot;The Parish Register&quot;, to which were added &quot;Sir Eustace Grey&quot; and &quot;The Hall of Justice&quot;. The volume was dedicated to Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland, nephew and sometime ward of Charles James Fox. An interval of 22 years had passed since Crabbe&#x27;s last appearance as an author, and he explained in the preface to this volume the reasons for this lapse as being his higher calling as a clergyman and his slow progress in poetical ability. This volume led to Crabbe&#x27;s general acceptance as an important poet. Four editions were issued during the following year and a half, the fourth appearing in March 1809. The reviews were unanimous in approval, headed by Francis Jeffrey in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;.

In 1809 Crabbe sent a copy of his poems in their fourth edition to Walter Scott, who acknowledged them in a friendly reply. Scott told Crabbe &quot;how for more than twenty years he had desired the pleasure of a personal introduction to him, and how, as a lad of eighteen, he had met with selections from &quot;The Village&quot; and &quot;The Library&quot; in &quot;The Annual Register&quot;.&quot; This exchange of letters led to a friendship that lasted for the rest of their lives, both authors dying in 1832. Crabbe&#x27;s favourite among Scott&#x27;s &quot;Waverley&quot; novels was &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot;.

The success of &quot;The Parish Register&quot; in 1807 encouraged Crabbe to proceed with a far longer
poem, which he had been working on for several years. &quot;The Borough&quot; was begun at Rendham in Suffolk in 1801, continued at Muston after his return in 1805, and finally completed during a long visit to Aldeburgh in the autumn of 1809. It was published in 1810. In spite of its defects, &quot;The Borough&quot; was an outright success. The poem appeared in February 1810, and went through six editions in the next six years.

When he visited London a few years later and was received with general welcome in the literary world, he was very surprised. &quot;In my own village&quot;, he told James Smith, &quot;they think nothing of me.&quot; The three years following the publication of &quot;The Borough&quot; were especially lonely for him. He did have his two sons, George and John, with him; they had both passed through Cambridge, one at Trinity and the other at Caius, and were now clergymen themselves, each holding a curacy in the neighbourhood, enabling them to live under the parental roof, but Mrs. Crabbe&#x27;s health was now very poor, and Crabbe had no daughter or female relative at home to help him with her care.

===Later life===
Crabbe&#x27;s next volume of poetry, &quot;Tales&quot;, was published in the summer of 1812. It received a warm welcome from the poet&#x27;s admirers, was favourably reviewed by Jeffrey in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; and is considered to be his masterpiece. In the summer of 1813, Mrs. Crabbe felt well enough to want to see London again, and the father and mother and two sons spent nearly three months in rooms in a hotel. Crabbe was able to visit Dudley North and some of his other old friends, and to visit and help the poor and distressed, remembering his own want and misery in the great city thirty years earlier. The family returned to Muston in September, and Mrs. Crabbe died at the end of October at the age of 63. Within days of his wife&#x27;s death Crabbe fell seriously ill, and was in danger of dying. He rallied, however, and returned to the duties of his parish. In 1814, he became rector of St James&#x27;, the parish church of the town of Trowbridge in Wiltshire, a position given to him by the new Duke of Rutland. He remained at Trowbridge for the rest of his life.

His two sons followed him, as soon as their existing engagements allowed them to leave Leicestershire. The younger, John, who married in 1816, became his father&#x27;s curate, and the elder, who married a year later, became curate at Pucklechurch, not far away. Crabbe&#x27;s reputation as a poet continued to grow in these years. His reputation soon made him a welcome guest in many houses to which his position as rector might not have admitted him. Nearby at Bremhill was the poet William Lisle Bowles, who introduced Crabbe to the noble family at Bowood House, home of the Marquess of Lansdowne, who was always ready to welcome those distinguished in literature and the arts. It was at Bowood that Crabbe first met the poet Samuel Rogers, who became a close friend and had an influence on Crabbe&#x27;s poetry. In 1817, on the recommendation of Rogers, Crabbe stayed in London from the middle of June to the end of July in order to enjoy the literary society of the capital. While there he met Thomas Campbell, and through him and Rogers was introduced to his future publisher John Murray.
In June 1819, Crabbe published his collection &quot;Tales of the Hall&quot;. The last 13 years of Crabbe&#x27;s life were spent at Trowbridge, varied by occasional visits among his friends at Bath and the surrounding neighbourhood, and by yearly visits to his friend Samuel Hoare Jr in Hampstead. From there it was easy to visit his literary friends in London, while William Wordsworth, Southey, and others occasionally stayed with the family. Around 1820 Crabbe began suffering from frequent severe attacks of neuralgia, and this illness, together with his age, made him less and less able to travel to London.

In the spring of 1822, Crabbe met Walter Scott for the first time in London, and promised to visit him in Scotland in the autumn. He kept this promise during George IV&#x27;s visit to Edinburgh, in the course of which the King met Scott and the poet was given a wine glass from which the King had drunk. Scott returned from the meeting with the King to find Crabbe at his home. As John Gibson Lockhart related in his &quot;Life of Sir Walter Scott&quot;,
Scott entered the room that had been set aside for Crabbe, wet and hurried, and embraced Crabbe with brotherly affection. The royal gift was forgotten—the ample skirt of the coat within which it had been packed, and which he had hitherto held cautiously in front of his person, slipped back to its more usual position—he sat down beside Crabbe, and the glass was crushed to atoms. His scream and gesture made his wife conclude that he had sat down on a pair of scissors, or the like: but very little harm had been done except the breaking of the glass.
Later in 1822, Crabbe was invited to spend Christmas at Belvoir Castle, but was unable to make the trip because of the winter weather. While at home, he continued to write a large amount of poetry, leaving 21 manuscript volumes at his death. A selection from these formed the &quot;Posthumous Poems&quot;, published in 1834. Crabbe continued to visit at Hampstead throughout the 1820s, often meeting the writer Joanna Baillie and her sister Agnes. In the autumn of 1831, Crabbe visited the Hoares. He left them in November, expressing his pain and sadness at leaving in a letter, feeling that it might be the last time he saw them. He left Clifton in November, and went direct to his son George, at Pucklechurch. He was able to preach twice for his son, who congratulated him on the power of his voice, and other encouraging signs of strength. &quot;I will venture a good sum, sir,&quot; he said, &quot;that you will be assisting me ten years hence.&quot; &quot;Ten weeks&quot; was Crabbe&#x27;s answer, and the prediction was right almost to the day.

After a short time at Pucklechurch, Crabbe returned to his home at Trowbridge. Early in January he reported continued drowsiness, which he felt was a sign of increasing weakness. Later in the month he was prostrated by a severe cold. Other complications arose, and it soon became apparent that he would not live much longer. He died on 3 February 1832, with his two sons and his faithful nurse by his side.

==Poetry==

Crabbe&#x27;s poetry was predominantly in the form of heroic couplets, and has been described as unsentimental in its depiction of provincial life and society. John Wilson wrote that &quot;Crabbe is confessedly the most original and vivid painter of the vast varieties of common life that England has ever produced;&quot; and that &quot;In all the poetry of this extraordinary man, we see a constant display of the passions as they are excited and exacerbated by the customs, laws, and institutions of society.&quot; &quot;The Cambridge History of English Literature&quot; saw Crabbe&#x27;s importance to be more in his influence than in his works themselves: &quot;He gave the poetry of nature new worlds to conquer (rather than conquered them himself) by showing that the world of plain fact and common detail may be material for poetry&quot;.

Although Augustan literature played an important role in Crabbe&#x27;s life and poetical career, his body of work is unique and difficult to classify. His best works are an original achievement in a new realistic poetical form. The major factor in Crabbe&#x27;s evolving from the Augustan influence to his use of realistic narrative was the changing readership of the late 18th–early 19th century. In the mid-18th century, literature was confined to the aristocratic and highly educated class; with the rise of the middle class at the turn of the 19th century, which came with a growing number of provincial papers, the heightening in production of books in weekly instalments, and the establishment of circulating libraries, the need for literature was spread throughout the middle class.

Narrative poetry was not a generally accepted mode in Augustan literature, making the narrative form of Crabbe&#x27;s mature works an innovation. This was due to some extent to the rise in popularity of the novel in the late 18th–early 19th century. Another innovation is the attention that Crabbe pays to details, both in description and characterization. Augustan critics had espoused the view that minute details should be avoided in favour of generality. Crabbe also broke with Augustan tradition by not dealing with exalted and aristocratic characters, but rather choosing people from middle and working-class society. Poor characters like Crabbe&#x27;s often anthologized &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; from &quot;The Borough&quot; would have been completely unacceptable to Augustan critics. In this way, Crabbe created a new way of presenting life and society in poetry.

==Criticism==
Wordsworth predicted that Crabbe&#x27;s poetry would last &quot;from its combined merits as truth and poetry fully as long as anything that has been expressed in verse since it first made its appearance&quot;, though on another occasion, according to Henry Crabb Robinson, he &quot;blamed Crabbe for his unpoetical mode of considering human nature and society.&quot; This latter opinion was also held by William Hazlitt, who complained that Crabbe&#x27;s characters &quot;remind one of anatomical preservations; or may be said to bear the same relation to actual life that a stuffed cat in a glass-case does to the real one purring on the hearth.&quot; Byron, besides what he said in &quot;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers&quot;, declared, in 1816, that he considered Crabbe and Coleridge &quot;the first of these times in point of power and genius.&quot; Byron had felt that English poetry had been steadily on the decline since the depreciation of Pope, and pointed to Crabbe as the last remaining hope of a degenerate age.

Other admirers included Jane Austen, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and Sir Walter Scott, who used numerous quotes from Crabbe&#x27;s poems in his novels. During Scott&#x27;s final illness, Crabbe was the last writer he asked to have read to him. Lord Byron admired Crabbe&#x27;s poetry, and called him &quot;nature&#x27;s sternest painter, yet the best&quot;. According to critic Frank Whitehead, &quot;Crabbe, in his verse tales in particular, is an important—indeed, a major—poet whose work has been and still is seriously undervalued.&quot; His early poems, which were non-narrative essays in poetical form, gained him the approval of literary men like Samuel Johnson, followed by a period of 20 years in which he wrote much, destroying most of it, and published nothing. In 1807, he published his volume &quot;Poems&quot; which started off the new realistic narrative method that characterised his poetry for the rest of his career. Whitehead states that this narrative poetry, which occupies the bulk of Crabbe&#x27;s output, should be at the centre of modern critical attention.

Q. D. Leavis said of Crabbe: &quot;He is (or ought to be—for who reads him?) a living classic.&quot; His classic status was also supported by T. S. Eliot in an essay on the poetry of Samuel Johnson in which Eliot grouped Crabbe together favourably with Johnson, Pope and several other poets. Eliot said that &quot;to have the virtues of good prose is the first and minimum requirement of good poetry.&quot; Critic Arthur Pollard believes that Crabbe definitely met this qualification. Critic William Caldwell Roscoe, answering William Hazlitt&#x27;s question of why Crabbe had not in fact written prose rather than verse said &quot;have you ever read Crabbe&#x27;s prose? Look at his letters, especially the later ones, look at the correct but lifeless expression of his dedications and prefaces—then look at his verse, and you will see how much he has exceeded &#x27;the minimum requirement of good poetry&#x27;.&quot; The critic F. L. Lucas summed up Crabbe&#x27;s qualities: &quot;naïve, yet shrewd; straightforward, yet sardonic; blunt, yet tender; quiet, yet passionate; realistic, yet romantic.&quot; Crabbe, who is seen as a complicated poet, has been and often still is dismissed as too narrow in his interests and in his way of responding to them in his poetry. &quot;At the same time as the critic is making such judgments, he is all too often aware that Crabbe, nonetheless, defies classification&quot;, says Pollard.

Pollard has attempted to examine the negative views of Crabbe and the reasons for limited readership since his lifetime: &quot;Why did Crabbe&#x27;s &#x27;realism&#x27; and his discovery of what in effect was the short story in verse fail to appeal to the fiction-dominated Victorian age? Or is it that somehow psychological analysis and poetry are uneasy bedfellows? But then why did Browning succeed and Crabbe descend to the doldrums or to the coteries of admiring enthusiasts? And why have we in this century [the 20th century] failed to get much nearer to him? Does this mean that each succeeding generation must struggle to find his characteristic and essential worth? FitzGerald was only one of many among those who would make &#x27;cullings from&#x27; or &#x27;readings in&#x27; Crabbe. The implications of such selection are clearly that, though much has vanished, much deserves to remain.&quot;

==Entomology==
Crabbe was known as a coleopterist and recorder of beetles, and is credited for discovering the first specimen of &quot;Calosoma sycophanta&quot; L. to be recorded from Suffolk. He published an essay on the Natural History of the Vale of Belvoir in John Nichols&#x27;s, &quot;Bibliotheca Topographia Britannica, VIII, Antiquities in Leicestershire&quot;, 1790. It includes a very extensive list of local coleopterans, and references more than 70 species.

<doc id="276635" wikidata="Q373940" url="?curid=276635" title="Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet">
<text>Field Marshal Sir Henry Hughes Wilson, 1st Baronet, (5 May 1864 – 22 June 1922) was one of the most senior British Army staff officers of the First World War and was briefly an Irish unionist politician.

Wilson served as Commandant of the Staff College, Camberley, and then as Director of Military Operations at the War Office, playing a vital role in drawing up plans to deploy an Expeditionary Force to France in the event of war. He acquired a reputation as a political intriguer for his role in agitating for the introduction of conscription and the Curragh incident of 1914.
As Sub Chief of Staff to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), Wilson was Sir John French&#x27;s most important advisor during the 1914 campaign, but his poor relations with Haig and Robertson saw him sidelined from top decision-making in the middle years of the war. He played an important role in Anglo-French military relations in 1915 and – after his only experience of field command as a corps commander in 1916 – as an ally of the controversial French General Robert Nivelle in early 1917. Later in 1917 he was informal military advisor to British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and then British Permanent Military Representative at the Supreme War Council at Versailles. 

In 1918 Wilson served as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (the professional head of the British Army). He continued to hold this position after the war, a time when the Army was being sharply reduced in size whilst attempting to contain industrial unrest in the UK and nationalist unrest in Mesopotamia and Egypt. He also played an important role in the Irish War of Independence.

After retiring from the army Wilson served briefly as a Member of Parliament, and as security advisor to the Northern Ireland government. He was assassinated by two IRA gunmen in 1922.

==Family background==
The Wilson family claimed to have arrived in Carrickfergus with William of Orange in 1690, but may well have lived in the area prior to that. They prospered, as Ulster Protestants, in the Belfast shipping business in the late eighteenth and early 19th century and, following the Incumbered Estates (Ireland) Act 1849, became landowners. Wilson&#x27;s father James, the youngest of four sons, inherited Currygrane in Ballinalee (1,200 acres, worth £835 in 1878), making him a middle-ranking landowner. James Wilson served as a high sheriff, a justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant for Longford, and attended Trinity College Dublin. As late as the 1960s the IRA leader Seán Mac Eoin remembered the Wilsons as having been fair landlords and employers. The Wilsons also owned Frascati, an eighteenth-century house at Blackrock, Dublin.

Born at Currygrane, Henry Wilson was the second of James and Constant Wilson&#x27;s four sons (he also had three sisters). He attended Marlborough public school between September 1877 and Easter 1880, before leaving for a crammer to prepare for the Army. One of Wilson&#x27;s younger brothers also became an army officer and the other a land agent.

Wilson spoke with an Irish accent and at times regarded himself as British, Irish or an Ulsterman. Like many of his era, including Anglo-Irish or Ulster-Scots, he often referred to Britain as &quot;England&quot;. His biographer Keith Jeffery suggests that he may well, like many Anglo-Irish, have played up his &quot;Irishness&quot; in England and regarded himself as more &quot;Anglo-&quot; while in Ireland, and may well also have agreed with his brother Jemmy&#x27;s view that Ireland was not &quot;homogenous&quot; enough to be &quot;a Nation.&quot; Wilson was a devout member of the Church of Ireland, and on occasion attended Catholic services, but disliked &quot;Romish&quot; ritual.

==Early career==

===Junior officer===
Between 1881 and 1882 Wilson made several unsuccessful attempts to get into the British Army officer-training establishments: two to enter the Royal Military Academy (Woolwich) and three for the Royal Military College. The entrance examinations to both relied heavily on rote learning. Sir John Fortescue later claimed that this was because as a tall boy he needed &quot;time for his brain to develop&quot;.

Like French and Spears, among others, Wilson acquired his commission &quot;by the back door&quot;, as it was then known, by first becoming a militia officer. In December 1882 he joined the Longford Militia, which was also the 6th (Militia) Battalion of the Rifle Brigade. He also trained with the 5th Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers. After two periods of training he was eligible to apply for a regular commission, and after further cramming in the winter of 1883–84, and trips to Algiers and Darmstadt to learn French and German, he sat the Army exam in July 1884. He was commissioned into the Royal Irish Regiment, but soon transferred into the more prestigious Rifle Brigade.

Early in 1885 Wilson was posted with the 1st Battalion of the Rifle Brigade to India, where he took up polo and big game hunting. In November 1886 he was posted to the Upper Irawaddy, just south of Mandalay, in recently annexed Burma to take part in the Third Burmese War, whose counter-insurgency operations in the Arakan Hills became known as &quot;the subalterns&#x27; war&quot;. The British troops were organised into mounted infantry, accompanied by &quot;Goorkha police&quot;. Wilson worked with Henry Rawlinson of the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), who described him in his diary as &quot;a very good chap&quot;. On 5 May 1887 he was wounded above the left eye. The wound did not heal and after six months in Calcutta he spent almost the whole of 1888 recuperating in Ireland until he was passed fit for regimental duty. He was left disfigured. His wound earned him the nicknames &quot;Ugly Wilson&quot; and &quot;the ugliest man in the British Army&quot;.

===Marriage===
While in Ireland Wilson began courting Cecil Mary Wray, who was two years his senior. Her family, who had come over to Ireland late in Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign, had owned an estate called Ardamona near Lough Eske, Donegal, the profitability of which had never recovered from the Great Famine of Ireland of the 1840s. On 26 December 1849 two kegs of explosive were set off outside the house, after which the family only ever spent one more winter there. From 1850 Cecil&#x27;s father George Wray had worked as a land agent, latterly for Lord Drogheda&#x27;s estates in Kildare, until his death in 1878. Cecil grew up in straitened circumstances, and her views on Irish politics appear to have been rather more hardline than her husband&#x27;s. They were married on 3 October 1891.

The Wilsons were childless. Wilson lavished affection on their pets (including a dog &quot;Paddles&quot;) and other people&#x27;s children. They gave a home to young Lord Guilford in 1895–1896 and Cecil&#x27;s niece Leonora (&quot;Little Trench&quot;) from December 1902.

===Staff College===
While contemplating marriage, Wilson began to study for the Staff College, Camberley, in 1888, possibly as attendance at Staff College was not only cheaper than service with a smart regiment but also opened up the possibility of promotion. At this time Wilson had a private income of £200 a year from a £6,000 trust fund. At the end of 1888 Wilson was passed fit for home (but not overseas) service, and joined the 2nd battalion at Dover early in 1889. Wilson was elected to White&#x27;s in 1889.

After a posting to Aldershot, Wilson was posted to Belfast in May 1890. In May 1891 he passed 15th (out of 25) into Staff College. French and German were amongst his worst subjects, and he began study there in January 1892. After his difficulty in entering the Army, passing the entrance exam proved that he did not lack brains.

Colonel Henry Hildyard became Staff College Commandant in August 1893, beginning a reform of the institution, placing more emphasis on continuous assessment (including outdoor exercises) rather than examinations. Wilson also studied under Colonel George Henderson. Whilst at the College he visited the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War in March 1893. Rawlinson and Thomas D&#x27;Oyly Snow were often his study partners. Rawlinson and Wilson became close friends, often staying and socialising together, and Rawlinson introduced Wilson to Lord Roberts in May 1893, whilst both men were working on a scheme for the defence of India. Wilson became a protégé of Roberts.

===Staff officer===
Wilson graduated from Staff College in December 1893 and was immediately promoted captain. He was due to be posted with the 3rd Battalion to India early in 1894, but after extensive and unsuccessful lobbying he obtained a medical postponement. He then learned that he was to join the 1st Battalion in Hong Kong for two years, but swapped with another captain. There is no clear evidence as to why Wilson was so keen to avoid overseas service. Repington, then a staff captain in the Intelligence Section at the War Office, took Wilson on a tour of French military and naval installations in July. After a very brief service with his regiment in September, with Repington&#x27;s help Wilson came to work at the War Office in November 1894, initially as an unpaid assistant, then succeeding to Repington&#x27;s own job. Wilson worked there for three years from November 1894. From November 1895 Wilson found time to assist Rawlinson with his &quot;Officer&#x27;s Note Book&quot; based on a previous book by Lord Wolseley, and which inspired the official &quot;Field Service Pocket Book&quot;.

Wilson worked in Section A (France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Latin America). In April 1895, despite intensive tutoring of up to three hours most days, he failed an exam in German for a posting to Berlin. On 5 May 1895, he took over from Repington as staff captain of section A, making him the youngest staff officer in the British Army. His duties took him to Paris (June 1895, to inquire about the expedition to Borgu on the Upper Niger) and Brussels. In January 1896 he seemed likely to be appointed brigade major of the 2nd brigade at Aldershot if the current incumbent, Jack Cowans, a notorious womaniser with a penchant for &quot;rough trade&quot;, resigned, although in the event this did not happen until early September.

==Boer War==

Believing war with the Transvaal &quot;very likely&quot; from spring 1897, Wilson canvassed for a place in any expeditionary force. That spring he helped Major H. P. Northcott, head of the British Empire section in the Intelligence Division, draw up a plan &quot;for knocking Kruger&#x27;s head off&quot;. Leo Amery later claimed that Wilson and Lieutenant Dawnay helped Roberts draw up what would become his eventual plan for invading the Boer republics from the west. He received a medal for riding in Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee procession, but regretted that he had not won a war medal. To his regret, and unlike his friend Rawlinson, Wilson missed out on a posting to the 1898 Sudan Expedition. When tensions mounted again in the summer of 1899, Wilson was appointed brigade major of the 3rd brigade, now renamed the 4th or &quot;Light&quot; brigade at Aldershot, which from 9 October was under the command of Neville Lyttelton. War was declared on 11 October 1899, and he arrived at Cape Town on 18 November.

Wilson&#x27;s brigade was amongst the troops sent to Natal – by late November it was encamped on the Mooi River, 509 miles from besieged Ladysmith. Wilson&#x27;s brigade took part in the Battle of Colenso (15 December), in which British troops, advancing after an inadequate artillery bombardment, were shot down by entrenched and largely hidden Boers armed with magazine rifles.Buller, who was still in command in Natal despite having been replaced by Roberts as Commander-in-Chief, was awaiting the arrival of Sir Charles Warren&#x27;s 5th Division. Artillery fire at the siege of Ladysmith could still be heard from Buller&#x27;s positions, but he rejected a proposal by Wilson that the Light Brigade cross the Tugela River at Potgieter&#x27;s Drift, 15 miles upstream. Wilson was critical both of the delay since 16 December and of Buller&#x27;s failure to share information with Lyttelton and other senior officers. Buller allowed Lyttleton to cross at that spot on 16 January, with the bulk of his reinforced forces crossing unopposed at Trikhardt&#x27;s Drift 5 miles upstream the following day. Wilson took credit for the Light Brigade&#x27;s diversionary artillery fire during the Trikhardt&#x27;s Drift crossing.

During the ensuing Battle of Spion Kop (24 January), Wilson was critical of Buller&#x27;s lack of a proper staff, of his lack of communication, and of his interference with Warren whom he had placed in charge. In an account written after the battle he claimed to have wanted to draw off pressure by sending two battalions – the Scottish Rifles (Cameronians) and 60th King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, as well as Bethune&#x27;s Buccaneers (a Mounted Infantry unit), to occupy the Sugar Loaf two miles East-North-East of Spion Kop, where Warren&#x27;s men were under fire from three sides. Lyttelton – 25 years later – claimed that Wilson had suggested to him to send reinforcements to help Warren. Wilson&#x27;s contemporary diary is ambiguous, claiming that &quot;we&quot; had sent the 60th to take the Sugar Loaf, whilst Bethune&#x27;s men and the Rifles went to assist Warren, and that as the Kop became crowded Lyttelton refused Wilson&#x27;s request to send the Rifles to the Sugar Loaf to assist the 60th.

After the defeat, Wilson was once again scornful of Buller&#x27;s lack of progress and of his predictions that he would be in Ladysmith by 5 February. Leo Amery later told a malicious story that Wilson had suggested gathering the brigade majors together to arrest their commanding general, although Wilson in fact seems to have thought highly of Lyttelton at this time. He was also highly critical of Fitzroy Hart (&quot;perfect disgrace … quite mad &amp; incapable under fire&quot;), commanding general of the Irish Brigade, for attacking Inniskilling Hill in close order on 24 February (see Battle of the Tugela Heights), and, on the same day, leaving the Durham Light Infantry (part of the Light Brigade) exposed to attack (Wilson visited the position, and they were withdrawn on 27 February after Wilson lobbied Lyttelton and Warren), and for leaving Wilson to organise a defence against a Boer night attack on Light Brigade HQ after refusing Light Brigade requests to post pickets. The Light Brigade finally took Inniskilling Hill on 27 February and Ladysmith was relieved the following day, allowing Wilson to meet his old friend Rawlinson, who had been besieged there, again. After the relief of Ladysmith, Wilson continued to be highly critical of the poor state of logistics and of the weak leadership of Buller and Dundonald. After the Fall of Pretoria he correctly predicted that the Boers would turn to guerrilla warfare, although he did not expect the war to last until spring 1902.

In August 1900 Wilson was summoned to see &quot;the Chief&quot; and appointed to assist Rawlinson at the Adjutant-General&#x27;s branch, choosing to remain there rather than return to his brigade-majorship (which passed to his brother Tono). Part of Wilson&#x27;s motivation was his desire to return home earlier. He shared a house in Pretoria with Rawlinson and Eddie Stanley (later Lord Derby), Roberts&#x27; secretary – they were all in their mid-thirties and socialised with Roberts&#x27; daughters, then aged 24 and 29. Wilson was appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General (1 September 1900) and Roberts&#x27; assistant military secretary in September, which meant that he returned home with Roberts in December. Lyttelton had wanted him in South Africa on his staff, whilst Kelly-Kenny wanted him on the staff of Southern Command which he was hoping to obtain.

==Repington divorce==
On 9 October 1899 Lieutenant Colonel Repington, for the sake of his career, gave Wilson his written promise to give up his mistress Mary Garstin. Wilson had been a friend of Mary Garstin&#x27;s father, who had died in 1893, and she was a cousin of his friend Lady Guilford, who asked Wilson to get involved at Christmas 1898. On 12 February 1900 Repington told him that he regarded himself as absolved from his parole after learning that her husband had been spreading rumours of his other infidelities. During the divorce hearings Wilson refused Repington&#x27;s request to sign an account of what had been said at their meeting, and was unable to grant the request of Kelly-Kenny (Adjutant-General to the Forces) for an account of the meeting as he had written no details of it in his diary (Lady Guilford had destroyed the letter which he had written her containing details). He was thus unable or unwilling to confirm Repington&#x27;s claim that he had released him from his parole. Repington believed that Wilson had &quot;ratted&quot; on a fellow soldier. Army gossip later had it that Wilson had deliberately ratted out a potential career rival. Repington had to resign his commission.

==Edwardian period==

===War Office===
In 1901 Wilson spent nine months working under Ian Hamilton in the War Office, working to allocate honours and awards from the recent South African War. He himself received a Mentioned in Despatches and a Distinguished Service Order, which Aylmer Haldane later claimed Wilson had insisted on receiving out of jealousy that he had been awarded it. Wilson was also recommended for brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel on attaining a substantive majority.

Between March and May 1901, at the behest of the Liberal Unionist MP Sir William Rattigan, and against the backdrop of St John Brodrick&#x27;s proposed Army reforms, Wilson – writing anonymously as &quot;a Staff Officer&quot; – published a series of twelve articles on Army Reform in the Lahore &quot;Civil and Military Gazette&quot;. He argued that given the recent great growth in the size of the Empire Britain could no longer rely on the Royal Navy alone. Wilson argued that the three main roles of the Army were home defence, defence of India (against Russia), Egypt and Canada (against the US, with whom Wilson nonetheless hoped Britain would remain on friendly terms), and defence of major coaling stations and ports for the Royal Navy&#x27;s use. Unlike St John Brodrick, Wilson at this stage explicitly ruled out Britain becoming involved in a European war. Without her major colonies, he argued, Britain would suffer &quot;the fate of Spain&quot;. He wanted 250,000 men to be made available for overseas service, not the 120,000 proposed by Brodrick, and contemplated the introduction of conscription (which had been ruled out by the Liberal Opposition). In private Wilson – partly motivated by the poor performance of ill-trained Yeomanry units in South Africa – and other War Office officers were less complimentary about Brodrick&#x27;s proposed reforms.

===Battalion commander===
Wilson gained both the substantive promotion to major and the promised brevet in December 1901, and in 1902 became Commanding Officer of the 9th Provisional Battalion, Rifle Brigade at Colchester, intended to supply drafts for the South African War, then still in progress. The battalion was disbanded in February 1903.

===Military education and training===
Wilson went back to the War Office as Rawlinson&#x27;s assistant at the Department of Military Education and Training under General Sir Henry Hildyard. The three men led a committee which worked on a &quot;Manual of Combined Training&quot; and a &quot;Staff Manual&quot; which formed the basis of Field Service Regulations Part II, which was to be in force when the Army went to war in August 1914. With £1,600 borrowed from his father, Wilson bought a house off Marylebone Road. In 1903 he became an Assistant Adjutant-General.

At this time Wilson was becoming friendly with political figures such as Arthur Balfour, Winston Churchill, Leo Amery and Leo Maxse. Some of St John Brodrick&#x27;s proposed reforms were criticised by the Elgin Report in August 1903. Brodrick was being attacked in Parliament by Conservative MPs, including Amery, to whom Wilson was feeding information.

===Esher reforms and General Staff===
On Leo Amery&#x27;s suggestion Wilson&#x27;s colleague Gerald Ellison was appointed Secretary of the War Office (Reconstitution) Committee (see Esher Report), which consisted of Esher, Admiral John Fisher and Sir George Clarke. Wilson approved of Esher&#x27;s aims, but not the whirlwind speed by which he began making changes at the War Office. Wilson impressed Esher, and was put in charge of the new department which managed Staff College, RMA, RMC and officers&#x27; promotion exams. Wilson often travelled around Britain and Ireland to supervise the training of officers and examinations for promotion.

Wilson attended the first ever General Staff Conference and Staff Ride at Camberley in January 1905. He continued to lobby for a General Staff to be set up, especially after the Dogger Bank incident of October 1904. Wilson proposed a strong Chief of the General Staff who would be the Secretary of State for War&#x27;s sole adviser on matters of strategy, ironically the position which would be held by Wilson&#x27;s rival Robertson during the First World War. Despite pressure from Repington, Esher and Sir George Clarke, progress on the General Staff was very slow. In August Brodrick&#x27;s successor Arnold-Forster issued a minute similar to Wilson&#x27;s of three months previous. Lyttelton (Chief of the General Staff), unaware of Wilson&#x27;s role, expressed support. In November Wilson released Arnold-Forster&#x27;s memo to the press, claiming he had been ordered to do so; Arnold-Forster initially expressed &quot;amazement&quot; but then agreed that the leak had &quot;done nothing but good&quot;.

The Wilsons had Christmas Dinner with Roberts in 1904 and 1905. Wilson assisted Roberts with his House of Lords speeches, and the closeness of their relationship attracted disapproval from Lyttelton, and possibly French and Arnold-Forster. Relations with Lyttelton became more strained in 1905–06, possibly out of jealousy or influenced by Repington. Wilson had predicted a hung Parliament in January 1906, but to his disgust, &quot;that traitor C.B.&quot; had won a landslide.

There was a war scare in May 1906 when the Turks occupied an old Egyptian fort at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba. Wilson noted that Grierson (Director of Military Operations) and Lyttelton (&quot;absolutely incapable … positively a dangerous fool&quot;) had approved the proposed scheme for military action, but neither the Adjutant-General nor the Quartermaster-General had been consulted. Repington wrote to Esher that Wilson was an &quot;intriguing impostor&quot; and &quot;a low-class schemer whose sole aptitude is for worshipping rising suns – an aptitude expressed by those who know him in more vulgar language&quot;. On 12 September 1906 Army Order 233 set up a General Staff to supervise education and training and to draw up war plans (Wilson had drafted an Army Order late in 1905, but it had been held up by disputes over whether staff officers should be appointed by the Chief of the General Staff as Wilson preferred or by an eleven-man selection board).

==Commandant, Staff College==
===Appointment===
Wilson had hoped, as early as March 1905, to succeed Rawlinson as Commandant at Staff College, Camberley. In July Lyttelton (Chief of the General Staff), who appears to have disliked Wilson, raised the job to a brigadier-general&#x27;s position, for which Wilson was not yet senior enough.

On 16 July 1906 Rawlinson told Wilson that he wanted him to succeed him at the end of the year, and the news appeared in the press in August amidst praise for Rawlinson, suggesting that he rather than Wilson had leaked it. Field Marshal Roberts wrote to Richard Haldane (Secretary of State for War) and Esher recommending Wilson on the basis of his excellent staff work in South Africa, and as a strong character needed to maintain Rawlinson&#x27;s improvements at Camberley. Wilson, who learned indirectly from Aylmer Haldane on 24 October that he was to get the job, wrote to thank Roberts, and was in little doubt that his support had clinched it for him. Wilson remained very close to Roberts, often joining him for Christmas Dinner and attending his Golden Wedding in May 1909. French (then commanding 1st Army Corps at Aldershot Command) had initially been suspicious of Wilson as a Roberts protégé, but now supported his candidacy, and by 1912 Wilson had become his most trusted adviser.

Wilson was promoted to substantive colonel on 1 January 1907 and his appointment as temporary brigadier-general and Commandant Staff College, Camberley, was announced on 8 January 1907. 
He was at first short of money – he had to borrow £350 (£ in 2016) to cover the expense of moving to Camberley, where his official salary was not enough to cover the cost of entertaining expected – and initially had to cut back on foreign holidays and social trips to London but after inheriting £1,300 on his father&#x27;s death in August 1907 was able to buy polo ponies and a second car in subsequent years. His pay as commandant rose from £1,200 in 1907 to £1,350 in 1910.

===Doctrine===
In speeches to students, Wilson stressed the need for administrative knowledge (&quot;the drudgery of staffwork&quot;), physical fitness, imagination, &quot;sound judgement of men &amp; affairs&quot; and &quot;constant reading &amp; reflexion on the campaigns of the great masters&quot;. Brian Bond argued that Wilson&#x27;s &quot;School of Thought&quot; meant not just common training for staff officers but also espousal of conscription and the military commitment to send a BEF to France in the event of war. Keith Jeffery argues that this is a misunderstanding by Bond: there is no evidence in Wilson&#x27;s writings to confirm that he meant the phrase in that way.

Although Wilson was less obsessed about the dangers of espionage than Edmonds, in March 1908 he had two German barbers removed as potential spies from Staff College.

Wilson was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the June 1908 Birthday Honours.

In 1908 Wilson had his senior class prepare a scheme for the deployment of an Expeditionary Force to France, assuming Germany to have invaded Belgium. Questions were asked in the House of Commons when news of this leaked out, and the following year no assumption was made of a German invasion of Belgium, and students were sharply reminded that the exercise was &quot;SECRET&quot;. Wilson first met Foch on a visit to the Ecole Superieur de Guerre in 1909; they struck up a good rapport. Wilson arranged for Foch and Victor Huguet to visit Britain in June 1910, and copied his practice of setting students outdoor exercises in which they were distracted by instructors shouting at them whilst they were attempting to draw up plans at short notice.

Accompanied by Colonel Harper, Wilson reconnoitred the likely future theatre of war. In August 1908, along with Edward Percival (&quot;Perks&quot;), they explored south of Namur by train and bicycle. In August 1909, Harper and Wilson travelled from Mons then down the French frontier almost as far as Switzerland. In spring 1910, this time by motor car, they travelled from Rotterdam into Germany, then explored the German side of the frontier.

Wilson privately supported conscription at least as early as 1905. He thought Haldane&#x27;s scheme to merge Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers into a new Territorial Army would not be enough to match German training and efficiency. Wilson successfully lobbied Haldane for an increase in the size of the Staff College to provide officers for the new Territorial Army. During Wilson&#x27;s tenure the number of instructors rose from 7 to 16 and the number of students from 64 to 100. In total, 224 Army and 22 Royal Navy officers studied under him.

Wilson voted for Parliament for the first time in January 1910 (for the Unionists). He recorded that &quot;the lies told by the Radicals from Asquith down are revolting&quot;.

===Lecturing style===
Launcelot Kiggell wrote that Wilson was a &quot;spell-binding&quot; lecturer as Commandant at Camberley. During his time as Commandant, Wilson gave 33 lectures. A number of students, of whom the most famous was Archibald Wavell, later contrasted Wilson&#x27;s expansive lecturing, ranging widely and wittily over geopolitics, with the more practical focus of his successor Robertson. Many of these recollections are unreliable in their details, may well exaggerate the differences between the two men, and may have been influenced by Wilson&#x27;s indiscreet diaries published in the 1920s.

Berkeley Vincent, who had been an observer in the Russo-Japanese War (he was a protégé of Ian Hamilton, whom Wilson appears to have disliked), took a more critical view of Wilson. He objected to Wilson&#x27;s tactical views – Wilson was sceptical of claims that Japanese morale had enabled their infantry to overcome Russian defensive firepower – and his lecturing style: &quot;a sort of witty buffoonery … a sort of English stage Irishman&quot;.

===Succession===
In May and June 1909 Wilson had been tipped to succeed Haig as Director of Staff Duties, although he would have preferred command of a brigade.
In April and May 1910, with his term of office at Camberley still officially running until January 1911, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), William Nicholson, told Wilson that he was to succeed Spencer Ewart as Director of Military Operations that summer and vetoed him from accepting Horace Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s offer of a brigade at Aldershot.

Wilson recommended Kiggell as his successor and thought the appointment of William Robertson &quot;a tremendous gamble&quot;. Robertson visited Camberley with Lord Kitchener (28 July 1910), who criticised Wilson; this may have been one of the causes of the poor relations between Wilson and Kitchener in August 1914. Edmonds later told a story of how Wilson had left a bill for £250 for furniture and improvements to the Commandant&#x27;s residence, and that Wilson&#x27;s predecessor Rawlinson, when approached by Robertson for advice, had commented that many of these improvements had been made by his own wife or by previous Commandants. Whatever the truth of the matter, relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter.

Repington (whom Wilson thought a &quot;lying brute&quot;) attacked the current standards of British staff officers in &quot;The Times&quot; on 27 September 1910, arguing that Wilson had educated staff officers to be &quot;sucking Napoleons&quot; and that Robertson was a &quot;first rate man&quot; who would sort it out.

==Director of Military Operations==
===Initial decisions===
In 1910 Wilson became Director of Military Operations at the British War Office. Wilson believed his most important duty as DMO to be planning for deployment of an expeditionary force to France. Of the 36 papers which Wilson wrote as DMO, 21 were taken up by matters pertaining to the Expeditionary Force. He hoped also to get conscription brought in, but this came to nothing.

Wilson described the size of Haldane&#x27;s planned Expeditionary Force as simply a &quot;reshuffle&quot; of the troops available in Britain. Ferdinand Foch was keen to enlist British military aid. He invited Wilson and Colonel Fairholme, British military attaché in Paris, to his daughter&#x27;s wedding in October 1910. On a visit to London (6 December 1910) Wilson took him for a meeting with Sir Arthur Nicolson, Permanent-Under Secretary at the Foreign Office.

In 1910 Wilson bought 36 Eaton Place on a 13-year lease for £2,100. His salary was then £1,500. The house was a financial burden and the Wilsons often let it out.

Wilson and his staff spent the winter of 1910–11 conducting a &quot;great strategical War Game&quot; to predict what the great powers would do when war broke out.

===Early 1911===
Wilson thought the existing plans for deployment of the BEF (known as the &quot;WF&quot; scheme – this stood for &quot;With France&quot; but was sometimes wrongly thought to stand for &quot;Wilson-Foch&quot;) &quot;disgraceful. A pure academic, paper arrangement of no earthly value&quot;. He sent Nicholson a long minute demanding authority over transport planning. He was given this after a lunch with Haldane.

On 27–28 January 1911, Wilson visited Brussels, dining with members of the Belgian General Staff, and later exploring the part of the country south of the Meuse with the military attaché Colonel Tom Bridges. Between 17 and 27 February, he visited Germany, meeting Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg and Admiral Tirpitz at a dinner at the British Embassy. On the return journey he dined in Paris with Foch, whom he warned against listening to Repington, and the French Chief of Staff General Laffort de Ladibat. Admiral John Fisher was hostile to Wilson&#x27;s plans to deploy forces to the continent. By 21 March Wilson was preparing plans to embark the BEF infantry by Day 4 of mobilisation, followed by the cavalry on Day 7 and the artillery on Day 9. Refusing Nicholson&#x27;s request (April 1911) that he help with Repington&#x27;s new &quot;Army Review&quot;, he declared him &quot;a man devoid of honour, &amp; a liar&quot;.

===Second Moroccan crisis===
On 19 July Wilson went to Paris for talks with Adolphe Messimy (French War Minister) and General Dubail (French Chief of Staff). The Wilson-Dubail memorandum, although making explicit that neither government was committed to action, promised that in the event of war the Royal Navy would transport 150,000 men to Rouen, Le Havre and Boulogne, and that the BEF would concentrate between Arras, Cambrai and St Quentin by the thirteenth day of mobilisation. In reality, the transport plans were nowhere near ready, although it is unclear that the French knew this. The French called the Expeditionary Force &quot;l&#x27;Armee Wilson&quot; although they seem to have been left with an inflated idea of the size of commitment which Britain would send.

Wilson approved of Lloyd George&#x27;s Mansion House speech (backing France). He lunched with Grey and Sir Eyre Crowe (Assistant Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office) on 9 August, urging them that Britain must mobilise on the same day as France and send the whole six divisions.

===CID meeting===
Hankey complained of Wilson&#x27;s &quot;perfect obsession for military operations on the Continent&quot;, scoffing at his bicycling trips around the French and Belgian borders, and accusing him of filling the War Office with like-minded officers. At Nicholson&#x27;s request Wilson prepared a paper arguing that British aid would be necessary to prevent Germany defeating France and achieving domination of the continent. He argued that by Day 13 of mobilisation France would have the upper hand, outnumbering the Germans, but by Day 17 Germany would outnumber France. However, because of road bottlenecks in the passable parts of the war theatre, the Germans would at most be able to deploy 54 divisions in the opening phase, allowing the 6 infantry divisions of the BEF a disproportionate effect on the outcome. Ernest R. May later claimed that Wilson had &quot;cooked&quot; these figures, but his arguments were challenged by Edward Bennett, who felt that Wilson&#x27;s numbers were not far wrong.

This became the General Staff position for the CID meeting on 23 August. Sir Arthur Wilson proposed that 5 divisions guard Britain whilst one land on the Baltic coast, or possibly at Antwerp, believing that the Germans would be halfway to Paris by the time an Expeditionary Force was ready, and that the four to six divisions Britain was expected to be able to muster would have little effect. Wilson thought the Royal Navy plan &quot;one of the most childish papers I ever read&quot;. Henry Wilson set out his own plans, apparently the first time the CID had heard them. Hankey recorded that Wilson&#x27;s lucid presentation carried the day even though Hankey himself did not entirely agree with it. Prime Minister H. H. Asquith ordered the Navy to fall in with the Army&#x27;s plans. After the meeting Hankey began to draw up the War Book detailing mobilisation plans, and yet the exact deployment of the BEF was still undecided as late as 4 August 1914.

Wilson had recommended deploying at Maubeuge. He thought (wrongly, as it turned out) that the Germans would only violate Belgian territory south of the Meuse. Over the next few weeks Wilson had several meetings with Churchill, Grey and Lloyd George, who were keen to obtain an agreement with Belgium. This attracted the opposition of Haldane and Nicholson, who suppressed a lengthy paper by Wilson arguing for an agreement with Belgium; the paper was eventually circulated to the CID by Nicholson&#x27;s successor Sir John French in April 1912.

===Late 1911===
Throughout the Agadir Crisis Wilson was keen to pass on the latest intelligence to Churchill. Wilson recorded four separate reports from spies of German troops massing opposite the Belgian frontier. Wilson was also responsible for Military Intelligence, then in its infancy. This included MO5 and the embryonic MI5 and MI6. It is unclear from the surviving documents just how much of Wilson&#x27;s time was taken up by these agencies.

In October 1911 Wilson went on another bicycle tour of Belgium south of the Meuse. On his way home, still keen to &quot;snaffle these Belgians&quot; he visited the British military attaché in Brussels.

Radical members of the Cabinet pushed for Wilson&#x27;s removal, but he was staunchly defended by Haldane, who had the backing of the most influential ministers: Asquith, Grey and Lloyd George, as well as Churchill.

===1912===
Intelligence suggested that Germany was preparing for war in April 1912. In February 1912 Wilson inspected the docks at Rouen, had meetings in Paris with Joffre, de Castelnau and Millerand (War Minister), visited Foch, and inspected southern Belgium and the Maastricht appendix. Sir John French, the new CIGS, was receptive to Wilson&#x27;s wishes to prepare for war. In April Wilson played golf with Tom Bridges, briefing him for talks with the Belgians, whom Wilson wanted to strengthen Liege and Namur.

Through his brother Jemmy, Wilson forged links with the new Conservative leader Bonar Law. Jemmy had been on the platform in Belfast in April 1912 when Law addressed a mass meeting against Home Rule, and in the summer of 1912 he came to London to work for the Ulster Defence League (run by Walter Long and Charlie Hunter). Wilson dined with Law and was impressed by him, discussing Ireland and defence matters. That summer he began having regular talks with Long, who used Wilson as a conduit to try to establish cross-party defence agreement with Churchill.

Wilson thought Haldane a fool for thinking that Britain would have a time window of up to six months in which to deploy the BEF. In September 1912 he inspected Warsaw with Alfred Knox, British military attaché in Russia, then met Zhilinsky in St Petersburg, before visiting the battlefield of Borodino, and Kiev, then – in Austria-Hungary – Lemburg, Krakow and Vienna. Plans to visit Constantinople had to be shelved because of the First Balkan War, although Wilson recorded his concerns that the Bulgars had beaten the Turks a month after the declaration of war – evidence that the BEF must be committed to war at once.

By 14 November 1912 the railway timetables were ready, after two years of work. A joint Admiralty-War Office committee, including representatives of the merchant shipping industry, met fortnightly from February 1913, and produced a workable scheme by spring 1914. Brian Bond argued that Wilson&#x27;s greatest achievement as DMO was the provision of horses and transport and other measures which allowed mobilisation to proceed smoothly.

In November 1912 Repington, who wanted to use the Territorial Army as a basis for conscription, urged Haldane (now Lord Chancellor) to have Wilson sacked and replaced by Robertson.

In 1912 Wilson was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Irish Rifles.

===1913===
Wilson&#x27;s support for conscription made him friendly with Leo Amery, Arthur Lee, Charlie Hunter, Earl Percy, (Lord) Simon Lovat, Garvin of &quot;The Observer&quot;, Gwynne of &quot;The Morning Post&quot; and F.S Oliver, owner of the Department Store Debenham and Freebody. In December 1912 Wilson cooperated with Gwynne and Oliver in a campaign to destroy the Territorial Force.

In the spring of 1913 Roberts arranged a reconciliation between Repington and Wilson. Repington wrote a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; in June 1913, demanding to know why Wilson was not playing a more prominent role in the debates of 1913–14 as to whether some British regular divisions should be retained at home to defeat a potential invasion. In May 1913 Wilson suggested that Earl Percy write an article against the &quot;voluntary principle&quot; for the &quot;National Review&quot; and helped him write it. He was also drafting pro-conscription speeches for Lord Roberts.

Wilson visited France seven times in 1913, including a visit in August to observe French manoeuvres. Wilson spoke French fluently but not perfectly, and would sometimes revert into English for sensitive matters in order not to risk speaking inaccurately.

In October 1913 Wilson visited Constantinople. Wilson was unimpressed by the Turkish Army and road and rail infrastructure, and felt that the introduction of constitutional government would be the final blow to the Ottoman Empire. These views may have contributed to the underestimation of Turkey&#x27;s defence strength at Gallipoli.

Roberts had been lobbying French to promote Wilson to major-general, a rank appropriate to his job as DMO, since the end of 1912. In April 1913, with a brigade command about to fall vacant, Wilson was assured by French that he was to be promoted to major-general later in the year, and that not having commanded a brigade would not prevent him commanding a division later. Wilson believed that French wanted him to become chief of staff designate of the BEF after the 1913 manoeuvres, but that he was too junior. Instead Murray was appointed.

Wilson was promoted major general in November 1913. French confided that he intended to have his own term as CIGS extended by two years to 1918, and to be succeeded by Murray, at which point Wilson was to succeed Murray as sub-CIGS. After a 17 November 1913 meeting of BEF senior officers, Wilson privately recorded his concerns at French&#x27;s lack of intellect and hoped there would not be a war just yet.

Early in 1914, at an exercise at Staff College, Wilson acted as Chief of Staff. Edmonds later wrote that Robertson, acting as Exercise Director, drew Wilson&#x27;s attention to his ignorance of certain procedures, and said to French in a stage whisper &quot;if you go to war with that operations staff, you are as good as beaten&quot;.

==Curragh incident==
===Crisis brews===
As far back as 1893, during the passage of Gladstone&#x27;s Second Home Rule Bill, Wilson had been party to a proposal to raise 2,000–4,000 men, to drill as soldiers in Ulster, although he wanted Catholics also to be recruited. Wilson supported Ulster Unionist opponents of the Third Irish Home Rule Bill, due to become law in 1914. Wilson had learned from his brother Jemmy about plans to raise 25,000 armed men and 100,000 &quot;constables&quot;, and to form a Provisional Government in Ulster to take control of banks and railways, which he thought &quot;all very sensible&quot;. Asked by Roberts (16 April 1913) to be chief of staff to the &quot;Army of Ulster&quot;, Wilson replied that if necessary he would fight for Ulster rather than against her.

At a meeting at the War Office (4 November 1913), Wilson told French that he &quot;could not fire on the north at the dictates of Redmond&quot; and that &quot;England &quot;qua&quot; England is opposed to Home Rule, and England must agree to it ... I cannot bring myself to believe that Asquith will be so mad as to employ force&quot;. French, whom Wilson urged to tell the King that he could not depend on the loyalty of the &quot;whole&quot; of the Army, was unaware that Wilson was leaking the contents of these meetings to the Conservative leader Bonar Law.

Wilson met Bonar Law and told him that he did not agree that the percentage of defections in the officer corps would be as high as 40%, the figure suggested by the King&#x27;s adviser Lord Stamfordham. He passed on his wife Cecil&#x27;s advice that the UVF should take the patriotic high ground by pledging to fight for King and Country in the event of war. Bonar Law immediately attempted to reach Carson on the telephone to relay this suggestion. Wilson also advised Bonar Law to ensure that negotiations failed in way which made the Irish Nationalists look intransigent.

On 14 November he dined with Charlie Hunter and Lord Milner, who told him that any officers who resigned over Ulster would be reinstated by the next Conservative Government. Wilson also warned Edward Sclater that the UVF should not take any action hostile to the Army. Wilson found Asquith&#x27;s Leeds speech – in which the Prime Minister promised to &quot;see this thing through&quot; without an election – &quot;ominous&quot;, and on 28 November John Du Cane turned up at the War Office &quot;furious&quot; with Asquith and asserting that Ulster would have to be granted Belligerent status like the Confederate States of America.

The Wilson and Rawlinson families spent Christmas with Lord Roberts, who was strongly opposed to the planned legislation, as was Brigadier Johnnie Gough, with whom Wilson played golf on Boxing Day, as was Leo Amery with whom he lunched at White&#x27;s on New Year&#x27;s Day. Wilson&#x27;s main concern was &quot;that the army should not be drawn in&quot;, and on 5 January he had &quot;a long and serious talk about Ulster &amp; whether we couldn&#x27;t do something to keep the Army out of it&quot; with Joey Davies (Director of Staff Duties since October 1913) and Robertson (Director of Military Training), and the three men agreed to take soundings of army opinion at the annual Staff College conference at Camberley the following week. At the end of February Wilson went to Belfast, where he visited the Unionist Headquarters at Old Town Hall. His mission was not secret – the official purpose was to inspect 3rd Royal Irish Rifles and give a lecture on the Balkans at Victoria Barracks, and he reported his opinion of the Ulster situation to the Secretary of State and to Sir John French – but attracted press speculation. Wilson was delighted by the Ulster Volunteers (now 100,000 strong), to whom he was also leaking information.

===The incident===

After Paget had been told to prepare to deploy troops in Ulster, Wilson attempted in vain to persuade French that any such move would have serious repercussions not only in Glasgow but also in Egypt and India. Wilson helped the elderly Lord Roberts (morning of 20 March) draft a letter to the Prime Minister, urging him not to cause a split in the army. Wilson was summoned home by his wife to see Johnnie Gough, who had come up from Aldershot, and told him of Hubert Gough&#x27;s threat to resign (see Curragh incident). Wilson advised Johnnie not to &quot;send in his papers&quot; (resign) just yet, and telephoned French, who when told of the news &quot;talked windy platitudes till (Wilson) was nearly sick&quot;.

By the morning of Saturday 21 Wilson was talking of resigning and urging his staff to do the same, although he never actually did so and forfeited respect by talking too much of bringing down the government. With Parliament debating a Conservative motion of censure on the government for using the Army in Ulster, Repington telephoned Wilson (21 April 1914) to ask what line &quot;The Times&quot; should take. Fresh from a visit to Bonar Law (21 March), Wilson suggested prodding Asquith to take &quot;instant action&quot; to prevent general staff resignations. At the request of Seely (Secretary of State for War) Wilson wrote a summary of &quot;what the army would agree to&quot;, namely a promise that the army would not be used to coerce Ulster, but this was not acceptable to the government. Despite Robertson&#x27;s warm support, Wilson was unable to persuade French to warn the government that the Army would not move against Ulster.

Hubert Gough breakfasted with Wilson on 23 March, before his meeting with French and Ewart at the War Office, where he demanded a written guarantee that the Army would not be used against Ulster. Wilson was also present at the 4pm meeting at which Gough, on his advice, insisted on amending a Cabinet document to clarify that the Army would not be used to enforce Home Rule &quot;on Ulster&quot;, to which French also agreed in writing. Wilson then left, telling people in the War Office that the Army had done what the Opposition had failed to do (i.e. prevent the coercion of Ulster). Wilson told French that he suspected he (French) would be sacked by the Government, in which case &quot;the Army would go solid with him&quot;. To his brother&#x27;s amusement, Johnnie Gough &quot;hotted&quot; (teased) Wilson by affecting to believe that he was actually going to resign.
Wilson was worried that a future Dublin government might issue &quot;lawful orders&quot; to coerce Ulster. At the top of his diary page for 23 March he wrote: &quot;We soldiers beat Asquith &amp; his vile tricks&quot;.

Asquith publicly repudiated the amendments to the Cabinet document, but at first refused to accept the resignations of French and Ewart, although Wilson advised French that he must resign &quot;unless they were in a position to justify their remaining on in the eyes of officers&quot;. French eventually resigned after Wilson tested the climate at a Staff College point-to-point.

===Effects===
Wilson telegraphed Gough twice and advised him to &quot;stand like a rock&quot; and hold onto the document, but received no reply. Milner thought Wilson had &quot;saved the Empire&quot;, which Wilson thought &quot;much too flattering&quot;. He thought Morley (who had advised Seely) and Haldane (who advised French) would also have to resign, which would bring down the government. Gough was angry that Wilson had not himself offered to resign and blamed Wilson for having done nothing to stop the government&#x27;s plans to coerce Ulster until Gough and his officers threatened to resign. The Gough brothers thereafter cut Wilson.

Between 21 March and the end of the month, Wilson saw Law nine times, Amery four times, Gwynne three times, and Milner and Arthur Lee twice. He does not seem to have regarded these contacts with the Opposition as secret. Roberts was also leaking information which he was being fed by Wilson and the Gough brothers. Gough promised to keep the 23 March Treaty confidential, but it soon leaked to the press – it appears that both Gough and French leaked it to Gwynne, whilst Wilson leaked it to Amery and Bonar Law.

==First World War==

===1914===

====Outbreak of war====
Wilson visited France four times to discuss war plans between January and May 1914. With the CID having recommended that two of the BEF&#x27;s six divisions be retained at home to guard against invasion, Wilson successfully lobbied Asquith, who was Secretary of State for War, to send at least five divisions to France.

During the July Crisis Wilson was mainly preoccupied with the apparent imminence of civil war in Ireland and vainly lobbied the new CIGS Charles Douglas to flood the whole of Ireland with troops. By the end of July it was clear that the continent was on the brink of hostilities. Wilson called on de la Panouse (French Military Attaché) and Paul Cambon (French Ambassador) to discuss the military situation. Wilson may well have been keeping the Conservative leadership informed of discussions between Cambon and Foreign Secretary Grey. The German invasion of Belgium provided a &quot;casus belli&quot; and Britain mobilized on 3 August and declared war on 4 August.

====Sub Chief of Staff, BEF: deployment====
Wilson was initially offered the job of &quot;Brigadier-General of Operations&quot; but as he was already a major-general he negotiated an upgrade in his title to &quot;Sub Chief of Staff&quot;. Edmonds, Kirke and Murray all claimed after the war that French had wanted Wilson as Chief of Staff, but this had been vetoed because of his role in the Curragh Mutiny; no contemporary evidence, even Wilson&#x27;s diary, confirms this.

Wilson met with Victor Huguet (7 August), a French liaison officer summoned to London at Kitchener&#x27;s request, and sent him back to France to obtain more information from Joffre, having told him of British plans to start movement of troops on 9 August. Kitchener, angry that Wilson had acted without consulting him, summoned him for a rebuke. Wilson was angry that Kitchener was confusing the mobilisation plans by deploying troops from Aldershot to Grimsby in case of German invasion, and recorded in his diary that &quot;I answered back as I have no intention of being bullied by him especially when he talks such nonsense … the man is a fool … He is a d---- fool&quot;. On Huguet&#x27;s return (12 August) he met with French, Murray and Wilson. They agreed to deploy the BEF to Maubeuge, but Kitchener, in a three-hour meeting which was, according to Wilson, &quot;memorable in showing K&#x27;s colossal ignorance and conceit&quot;, tried to insist on a deployment to Amiens where the BEF would be in less danger of being overrun by the Germans coming north of the Meuse. Wilson wrote not just of the difficulties and delays which Kitchener was making but also of &quot;the cowardice of it&quot;, although historian John Terraine later argued that Kitchener&#x27;s opposition to a forward deployment was proven entirely correct by the nearness which the BEF came to disaster. The clash of personalities between Wilson and Kitchener worsened relations between Kitchener and Sir John French, who often took Wilson&#x27;s advice.

Wilson, French and Murray crossed to France on 14 August. Wilson was sceptical of the German invasion of Belgium, feeling that it would be diverted to meet the French thrusts into Lorraine and the Ardennes. Reconnoitring the area with Harper in August 1913, Wilson had wanted to deploy the BEF just east of Namur. Although Wilson&#x27;s prediction of the German advance was less prescient than Kitchener&#x27;s, had this been done, it is possible that Anglo-French forces could have attacked north, threatening to cut off the German Armies moving westwards north of the Meuse.

Like other British commanders Wilson, at first, underestimated the size of German forces opposite the BEF, although Terraine and Holmes are very critical of the advice which Wilson was giving Sir John on 22 August, encouraging further BEF advances and &quot;calculating&quot; that the BEF was faced only by one German corps and a cavalry division. Wilson even issued a rebuke to the Cavalry Division for reporting that strong German forces were heading on Mons from Brussels, claiming that they were mistaken.

On 23 August, the day of the Battle of Mons, Wilson initially drafted orders for II Corps and the cavalry division to attack the following day, which Sir John cancelled (after a message was received from Joffre at 8pm warning of at least 2 ½ German corps opposite – there were in fact three German corps opposite the BEF with a fourth moving around the British left flank, and then a retreat was ordered at 11pm when news came that Lanrezac&#x27;s Fifth Army on the right was falling back). On 24 August, the day after the battle, he bemoaned that no retreat would have been necessary had the BEF had six infantry divisions as originally planned. Terraine describes Wilson&#x27;s diary account of these events as &quot;a ridiculous summary … by a man in a responsible position&quot;, and argues that although Kitchener&#x27;s fears of a German invasion of Britain had been exaggerated, his consequent decision to hold back two divisions saved the BEF from a greater disaster which might have been brought on by Wilson&#x27;s overconfidence.

====Sub Chief of Staff, BEF: retreat====
The BEF staff performed poorly over the next few days. Various eyewitnesses reported that Wilson was one of the calmer members of GHQ, but he was concerned at Murray&#x27;s medical unfitness and French&#x27;s apparent inability to grasp the situation. Wilson opposed Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s decision to stand and fight at Le Cateau (26 August). However, when told by Smith-Dorrien that it would not be possible to break off and fall back until nightfall, by his own account he wished him luck. Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s slightly different recollection was that Wilson had warned that he risked being encircled like the French at Sedan in 1870.

Baker-Carr recalled Wilson&#x27;s standing in dressing gown and slippers uttering &quot;sardonic little jests to all and sundry within earshot&quot; as GHQ packed up to evacuate, behaviour which historian Dan Todman comments was probably &quot;reassuring for some but profoundly irritating for others&quot;. Macready recorded Wilson (27 August) &quot;walking slowly up and down&quot; the room at Noyon which had been commandeered as headquarters with a &quot;comical, whimsical expression&quot;, clapping his hands and chanting &quot;We shall never get there, we shall never get there … to the sea, to the sea, to the sea&quot;, although he also recorded that this was probably intended to keep up the spirits of more junior officers. His infamous &quot;sauve qui peut&quot; order to Snow, GOC 4th Division, (27 August) ordering unnecessary ammunition and officers&#x27; kits to be dumped so that tired and wounded soldiers could be carried, was, according to Swinton, probably intended out of concern for the soldiers rather than out of panic. Smith-Dorrien was later rebuked by French for countermanding it. Lord Loch thought the order showed &quot;GHQ had lost their heads&quot; whilst General Haldane thought it &quot;a mad order&quot; (both in their diaries for 28 August). Major-General Pope-Hennessey later alleged (in the 1930s) that Wilson had ordered the destruction of orders issued during the retreat to hide the degree of panic.

After the war Wilson claimed that the Germans ought to have won in 1914 but for bad luck. Bartholomew, who had been a staff captain at the time, later told Liddell Hart that Wilson had been &quot;the man who saved the British Army&quot; for ordering Smith-Dorrien to retreat southwards after Le Cateau, thus breaking contact with the Germans who had expected him to retreat southwest. Wilson played an important role liaising with the French, and also appears to have dissuaded Joffre against further attacks by Lanrezac, with which the British would not have been able to assist (29 August). Whilst Murray was having an important meeting (4 September) with Gallieni (Military governor of Paris) and Maunoury (commander, French Sixth Army) to discuss the planned Allied counterattack which would become the First Battle of the Marne, Wilson was having a simultaneous meeting with Franchet d&#x27;Esperey (Fifth Army, on the British right), which envisaged Sixth Army attacking &quot;north&quot; of the Marne. Wilson later persuaded Sir John French to cancel his orders to retreat further south (4 September) and helped persuade him to join in the Battle of the Marne (6 September). Like many Allied leaders, Wilson believed after the victory at the Marne that the war was as good as won.

====Succession to Murray====
Wilson acted as chief of staff for the BEF when Murray visited the War Office in October. Like many senior Allied officers, Wilson believed that the war would be won by the following spring and felt that Kitchener was jeopardising the victory by withholding officers in Britain for what Wilson called his &quot;shadow armies&quot;. Wilson did not envisage British troops fighting under French command and opposed Foch&#x27;s request that Allenby and two battalions take part in a French attack. Murray (4–5 November) complained and threatened to resign when Wilson amended one of his orders without telling him. Wilson was present at the deathbed of his old patron Lord Roberts, returning home for the funeral at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

French told Wilson he was thinking of moving Murray to a corps command and insisting on Wilson replacing him, but Asquith forbade French to promote &quot;that poisonous tho&#x27; clever ruffian Wilson who behaved ... so badly ... about Ulster&quot;. Wilson claimed to have heard Joffre complain that it was &quot;a pity&quot; that Murray had not been removed, but when he heard of this Asquith put it down to &quot;the constant intriguing of that serpent Wilson&quot; whom he and Kitchener were determined to block. Asquith felt he was too Francophile and too fond of &quot;mischief&quot; (political intrigue), but despite Wilson&#x27;s advising French that the reasons for their objections were largely personal, he was not able to dissuade them from blocking the appointment. On a visit to London in early January Wilson heard from the King&#x27;s assistant secretary Clive Wigram that it was Asquith rather than Kitchener who was blocking the promotion, which Carson and Law were eager for him to have.

Jeffery argues that there is little &quot;specific&quot; evidence that Wilson intrigued to replace Murray, simply that he was widely suspected of having done so, and that his pro-French stance was regarded with deep suspicion by other British officers. When Murray was at last removed as chief of staff BEF in January 1915, his job went to the BEF Quartermaster-General &quot;Wully&quot; Robertson. Robertson refused to have Wilson as his deputy, so Wilson was instead appointed Principal Liaison Officer with the French, and promoted to temporary lieutenant general. French technically had no authority to make this promotion, but told Wilson he would resign if the Cabinet or War Office objected. The French had been lobbying so hard for Wilson&#x27;s appointment that even Sir John thought they should mind their own business. Asquith and Haig both remarked that this was putting Wilson out of mischief.

===1915–16===

====Principal Liaison Officer====
Wilson was &quot;rather upset by the changes made in his absence&quot; whilst he was touring the French front – Robertson removed Wilson&#x27;s ally, Brigadier General George Harper &quot;in a very untactful way&quot;. Wilson&#x27;s diary makes several references to Robertson being &quot;suspicious and hostile&quot; towards him. Wilson was suspected of intriguing for Robertson&#x27;s removal.

Wilson saw Foch every 2 to 3 days and sometimes smoothed tense meetings by creative (mis)translation. Wilson opposed the Gallipoli Campaign and recorded his anger that, after shells had had to be sent to Gallipoli, the BEF, then numbering 12 divisions, barely had enough High Explosive shell for the Battle of Festubert, which he thought could be &quot;one of the decisive actions of the war&quot;.

The failure to achieve quick success at Gallipoli, and the Shell Shortage to which that campaign contributed, led to Conservative ministers joining the new Coalition Government in May, which boosted Wilson&#x27;s prospects. Wilson was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the June 1915 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours, having been passed over for the honour in February. He was invited to speak at a Cabinet meeting in summer 1915. From July 1915 Asquith and Kitchener began to consult Wilson regularly and his personal relations with both men appear to have become more cordial.

Wilson deplored the botched August Landing at Suvla Bay in Gallipoli, writing that &quot;Winston first &amp; others after&quot; should be tried for murder. In the summer of 1915 Wilson believed that the French government might fall, or France herself seek peace, unless the British committed to the mooted Loos offensive. His efforts to be the main go-between of French and Joffre ended in September 1915, when it was decided that these contacts should go through Sidney Clive, the British liaison officer at GQG. Leo Maxse, H. A. Gwynne and the radical Josiah Wedgwood MP, impressed by Wilson&#x27;s support for conscription and for the abandonment of Gallipoli, tipped him as a potential CIGS in place of James Wolfe-Murray, but Archibald Murray was appointed instead (September 1915).

====Appointment as corps commander====
After the Battle of Loos, Sir John French&#x27;s days as Commander-in-Chief were numbered. Robertson told the King on 27 October that Wilson should be removed for not being &quot;loyal&quot; – Robertson had earlier criticised Wilson for his closeness to the French. Wilson was seen as &quot;an unofficial adviser&quot; of &quot;similar rank&quot; but &quot;totally different temperament&quot; to Robertson. 
Sir John French, Milner, Lloyd George and Arthur Lee all raised the possibility of Wilson becoming Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) in place of Murray. Hankey thought he might have become CIGS were it not for lingering mistrust over the Curragh incident, but there is no explicit evidence in Wilson&#x27;s diary that he coveted the job. Joffre suggested that Wilson should replace Kitchener as Secretary of State for War.

Wilson was also given the honorary appointment of Colonel of the Royal Irish Rifles on 11 November 1915, and was made a Commander and later Grand Officier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur for his services. Wilson attended the Anglo-French Chantilly Conference (6–8 December 1915) along with Murray (CIGS), French and Robertson, as well as Joffre, Maurice Pellé and Victor Huguet for France, Zhilinski and Ignatieff for Russia, Cadorna for Italy and a Serb and Belgian representative. Wilson disapproved of large meetings and thought the British and French War Ministers, C-in-Cs and foreign ministers (6 men in total) should meet regularly which might discourage ventures like Antwerp, Gallipoli and Salonika.

With French&#x27;s &quot;resignation&quot; imminent, Wilson, who appears to have remained loyal to him, attempted to resign and go on half pay (10 December) as he felt he could not serve under Haig or Robertson; Bonar Law and Charles E. Callwell attempted to dissuade him. Haig thought this unacceptable for such an able officer in wartime, and Robertson advised him that Wilson would &quot;do less harm&quot; in France than in England. 
Haig thought (12 December) Wilson should command a division before he commanded a corps, despite his belief that Wilson had criticised himself and other British generals, and had instigated an article in &quot;The Observer&quot; suggesting that the BEF be placed under General Foch (commander, French Northern Army Group) (Charteris wrote to his wife (12 December) apropos the articles that &quot;neither DH nor Robertson wants Wilson anywhere near them&quot;).

Rawlinson, rumoured to be in line for promotion to succeed Haig as GOC First Army, offered Wilson the chance to succeed him as GOC IV Corps, but Wilson preferred not to serve under Rawlinson, preferring instead the new XIV Corps, part of Allenby&#x27;s Third Army and including the 36th (Ulster) Division. Asquith summoned Wilson to London and personally offered him a corps, and Kitchener told him the corps command was to be &quot;only temporary pending something better&quot;, although Wilson thought impractical his suggestion that he simultaneously continue to perform Anglo-French liaison duties. Jeffery suggests Kitchener may have seen Wilson as a potential ally against Robertson.

Like many Conservatives Wilson was dissatisfied at Asquith&#x27;s lack of firm leadership and at the delay in bringing in conscription, and from December 1915 he urged Bonar Law to bring down the government (Law refused, pointing out that the resulting General Election would be divisive and the support of Radical and Irish MPs would be lost to the war effort).

====Corps Commander: spring 1916====
Wilson was given command of IV Corps. Given the difference in quality between his divisions, he took a keen interest in training. Like many, Wilson initially thought the Easter Rising (26 April 1916) was German-inspired. Bonar Law tentatively suggested him as a possible commander to put down the Rising, but his Ulster record made this unwise. Wilson hoped the events would lead to Asquith&#x27;s fall. Wilson thought that the crushing of troublemakers would prevent them infecting the supposed silent Unionist majority, and regretted the removal of General Maxwell later in the year &quot;to placate that giant fraud Redmond&quot;.

Wilson, in temporary command of First Army in Monro&#x27;s absence from 9 to 22 May, had to take over some more trench from Byng&#x27;s XVII Corps (part of Allenby&#x27;s Third Army) opposite Vimy Ridge. Two divisional commanders, William Walker (2nd, sick) and Barter (47th, on leave) were away until 22 May, further disrupting the chain of command as various officers were required to act in their seniors&#x27; place. A surprise German attack on the evening of Sunday 21 May moved forward 800 yards, capturing 1,000 yards of the British front line. Wilson appears to have done all he could, arranging the assembly of artillery from First Army and neighbouring Third Army, but the planned counterattack was postponed until 23 May by Monro, who had just returned from leave. At a major meeting at Wilson&#x27;s HQ (23 May) Monro and Allenby insisted the IV Corps counterattack must proceed, over the objection of John Headlam (artillery) and Tavish Davidson (Director of Military Operations) from GHQ, who passed on Haig&#x27;s wishes that the counterattack be postponed by a fortnight.

The counterattack failed, as two battalions in the centre found the German shelling too heavy for them to attack, and Monro eventually ordered a halt. Wilson wanted to court martial the two acting battalion commanders for &quot;funk&quot;, after hearing the view of one of the actual COs (who had been acting in command of the brigade) that the attack had been feasible. Major Armytage, a staff officer from GHQ, visited the sector on 25 May and reported back that Brigadier-General Kellett (99th Brigade, but acting GOC of 2nd Division) was incompetent and &quot;in complete ignorance of the situation&quot;. Haig wrote to Monro (27 May) that Wilson should be asked to explain and that IV Corps, formerly &quot;the most efficient in the army&quot; &quot;had much decreased in military value&quot; and Wilson &quot;had failed as a commander in the field&quot;. Charteris also visited IV Corps HQ on 27 May, and reported back that officers there were &quot;downhearted&quot; and thought the Germans and French better fighters than the British – Wilson later claimed that the officers had been &quot;pulling Charteris&#x27; leg&quot; as he talked of &quot;sweeping victories&quot; within two months. Wilson was almost &quot;degummed&quot; (sacked) but was saved by a strong report in his favour by Monro. The two acting battalion commanders were not court-martialled, but Kellett was never promoted to command a division. Jeffery argues that Wilson was, like many &quot;unsuccessful&quot; corps commanders, largely in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that Haig&#x27;s animosity for Wilson was a factor.

====Corps Commander: summer and autumn 1916====
With the major offensive on the Somme imminent, Foch told Wilson in May that until the Allies had far more guns and ammunition such an attack was &quot;suicidal&quot;, worries which were shared by Clemenceau. Like many British generals, Wilson was overly impressed by the amount of artillery available.

In August Haking, Wilson&#x27;s junior and a favourite of Haig, was made acting Army Commander when Monro left to become Commander-in-Chief, India. Wilson claimed in his diary that Monro had recommended him to command First Army but this was vetoed by Haig. Despite the hopes of his many political friends Wilson was blocked from further promotion.

By August Wilson had two elite divisions under his command, 63rd (Royal Naval) Division and 9th (Scottish) Division, but resisted pressure from Haig to conduct another attack until after 1 September. Wilson was aware that the greater success of French attacks on the Somme was largely owed to more concentrated artillery fire, and that British attacks at High Wood and Guillemont (late July) were less successful. It was decided to use a short traditional bombardment rather than a gas attack, and Wilson&#x27;s men experimented (in vain) with a flamethrower (in May he had been impressed by an explosive device, a sort of prototype Bangalore torpedo, to clear wire). Wilson was displeased at the poor state of air support but impressed by the early artillery sound ranging device which he was shown. With Haig convinced he was going to &quot;smash the Bosh on the Somme&quot; in September, GHQ now postponed Wilson&#x27;s attack until October, and now wanted the whole of Vimy Ridge taken, which would mean a joint attack with XVII Corps. Some of Wilson&#x27;s artillery was moved down to the Somme. Wilson continued to work on air-artillery coordination and mining, but rejected a proposal to dig jumping-off trenches into No Mans Land, as this would give away the attack.

In September 1916 Lloyd George, now Secretary of State for War, visited the Western Front and asked Wilson why the British had performed so much more poorly than the French on the Somme. Wilson stressed the inexperience of the British Army. On his visit Lloyd George had been told (falsely) that Wilson had not wanted to counterattack in May.

Wilson then had the 63rd and 9th Divisions taken away, then (10 October) heard his whole Corps was to be transferred to Gough&#x27;s Reserve Army, a prospect which did not please him. In October Gough &quot;hauled him over the coals over the state of IV Corps&quot;. By 18 October IV Corps had no divisions at all, and Wilson had to take 2 weeks leave in the UK in early November. Edmonds later wrote that Wilson&#x27;s preparations had laid the foundations for the successful capture of Vimy Ridge in April 1917.

Wilson thought that &quot;to slog on at one spot&quot; on the Somme was &quot;dreadfully lacking in imagination&quot; and would have preferred a joint offensive by Russia, Italy and Romania in Spring 1917 to draw off 15 or 20 German divisions, allowing the BEF to &quot;completely smash the Boch line&quot;. Summoned to see Lloyd George (13 November 1916) and asked if Britain could still hope to defeat Germany, Wilson advised him that she &quot;could&quot;, provided Haig were given enough men to fight &quot;two Sommes at once&quot;, but that in reality Haig should be firmly told how many men he was to receive and told to plan accordingly. He thought at the end of 1916 that both sides were claiming victory from that year&#x27;s fighting, but victory &quot;inclined to us&quot;, and that Germany might be driven to sue for peace in 1917.

===1917===

====Mission to Russia====
Lloyd George&#x27;s accession to the Premiership (December 1916) restarted Wilson&#x27;s career. In January 1917 Wilson accompanied Lloyd George to a conference at Rome. Despite the growing alliance between Wilson and the Prime Minister, Wilson agreed with Robertson that British heavy guns should not be sent to Italy or to the Salonika front.

Lloyd George wanted Russia persuaded to make the maximum possible effort. Wilson was sent as Senior Military Representative on a British mission to Russia in January 1917, the object of which was to keep the Russians holding down at least the forces now opposite them, to boost Russian morale and see what equipment they needed with a view to coordinating attacks. The party of 50 included British (led by Milner), French (led by de Castelnau) and Italian delegations. The War Office briefing advised that Russia was close to revolution. Wilson met the Tsar but thought him &quot;as devoid of character &amp; purpose as our own poor miserable King&quot;. Even senior Russian officials were talking openly of assassinating the Tsar or perhaps just the Tsarina. Wilson was impressed by Generals Ruzski and Danilov. He toured Petrograd, Moscow (where he was concerned at the food shortages) and Riga, and thought that even if Tsar and Tsarina were assassinated, Russia would not make a separate peace. His official report (3 March) said that Russia would remain in the war and that they would solve their &quot;administrative chaos&quot;. However, many other observers at the time felt that the advent of democracy in Russia would reinvigorate her war effort, so Wilson&#x27;s views were not entirely unusual.

====Chief of British Mission, French Army====
During the Calais Affair (whilst Wilson was away in Russia) Lloyd George had attempted to sideline Haig, whilst Nivelle, the French Commander-in-Chief (who spoke fluent English), would exercise operational command of the British Forces, through a British staff officer – Wilson was probably earmarked for this job. This plan fell through after Haig and Robertson threatened resignation. Wilson confessed to Derby that he did not get on with Haig or Robertson and told Robertson he wanted to return to commanding a corps. Hankey brokered an agreement whereby Haig would be subordinate to Nivelle only for the duration of the coming offensive and Wilson would do the liaison job but reporting to Haig. Wilson was appointed Chief of British Mission to the French Army on 17 March, with a promotion to permanent lieutenant-general which Robertson had blocked in November 1916. Gough wrote a damning letter to Stamfordham (i.e. for the King to see) complaining of how Wilson had made little impact either as a staff officer in 1914 or as a corps commander, but had a great reputation throughout the army for intrigue and for &quot;talk&quot;. However, the appointment was welcomed by Curzon, and the King and Esher also urged Haig and Robertson to accept the deal.

The new French War Minister Painlevé had a low opinion of Nivelle&#x27;s plan to achieve a decisive &quot;rupture&quot;, and after it failed he clearly wanted to sack Nivelle (contrary to Wilson&#x27;s advice on 26 April) and replace him with Pétain, who favoured abstaining from major offensives until the Americans were present in strength. Wilson did not agree with this, although the alternatives were whirlwind attacks like those Nivelle had launched at Verdun in late 1916 or – Wilson&#x27;s preference – a major attritional offensive like the Somme but &quot;with intelligence&quot;. He compared &quot;the school of the Great Offensive, of large numbers on long fronts, for unlimited objectives&quot; with the alternative of small and sudden offensives, and opined that &quot;both schools were wrong, and have been proved wrong over and over again&quot;. He urged &quot;a middle course of big operations on long fronts for limited objectives&quot; which would cause &quot;maximum of damage to the enemy with a minimum of loss to ourselves&quot; and keep the Germans &quot;in a state of constant tension and anxiety&quot;. (30 April 1917). Wilson was pleased with the promotion of his friend Foch to be French Chief of Staff but not the promotion of Pétain as French Commander-in-Chief (10 May) – Wilson was seen as pro-Nivelle and Petain soon began to deal directly with Haig, leaving little justification for Wilson&#x27;s job.
Robertson suggested once again that Wilson should return to commanding a corps, but Foch thought this a poor use of his talents. Haig&#x27;s diary states that Painlevé had told Lloyd George that Wilson was no longer &quot;persona grata&quot; with the French government. Wilson returned to London to sound out opinion about resigning and nobody tried to dissuade him. Whilst he was in London Lloyd George asked him to brief the War Cabinet individually then collectively with his advice that Britain try for some military or diplomatic success to drive Turkey or Bulgaria out of the war. On return to France Wilson declined Haig&#x27;s offer to command XIII Corps. Wilson then took a tour of the French line all the way down to the Swiss frontier, and was concerned that revolution seemed a possibility in France. He attempted to get a final interview with Painlevé but left after being kept waiting in a lobby with &quot;a pronounced whore&quot;. He had a meeting with Haig, who was encouraged by the recent success at Messines, and agreed with Haig&#x27;s plan for a major offensive in Flanders provided the weather remained favourable (Wilson was &quot;absolutely convinced that we should attack all we could right up to the time of the mud&quot;)

====Possible entry into politics====
The fall of Wilson&#x27;s ally Nivelle, and his awkward relations with his successor Pétain and with Haig and Robertson (he thought the latter were &quot;dunderheads&quot;) left Wilson without a post. Shuttling between England and France in June 1917, Wilson contemplated standing for Parliament. Back in 1916 the Conservative Party chairman Arthur Steel-Maitland had offered to get him a seat. Esher and Duncannon proposed forming a new &quot;National&quot; party of 20–30 MPs. The new party&#x27;s policies would include more vigorous prosecution of the war – Wilson urged the extension of conscription to Ireland – and the detachment of Turkey and Bulgaria. Wilson was worried that it would be the end of his army career and was short of money. His brother Jemmy proposed getting him an Ulster seat, and thought that the prospect of Wilson as an MP would annoy Robertson, but the Irish Unionist leader Carson thought an English seat more sensible. Bonar Law was dismissive of Wilson&#x27;s hopes that, like J. C. Smuts, he might be invited to join the War Policy Committee, and also poured cold water on the idea of Wilson becoming an MP. Wilson did not agree with Milner&#x27;s suggestion that he succeed Sarrail as Commander-in-Chief at Salonika. Éamon de Valera of Sinn Féin had recently won the East Clare by-election and on a visit to Currygrane (his first in eight years) everyone Wilson spoke to – judges, landowners, police officers, a Redmondite local politician and &quot;some natives&quot; agreed on the need for Irish conscription. Wilson, a lifelong Unionist, seems not to have anticipated the political consequences of such a move.

Brock Millman argues that the threat to stand for Parliament, where he could have intrigued as a Unionist along with his friends such as Bonar Law, Leo Amery and Colonel Lord Percy, ADC to the King, was blackmail to get a military job out of Lloyd George. Keith Jeffery rejects Millman&#x27;s approach, arguing that Wilson would have been no threat as a new MP but as a military adviser was a useful rival to Robertson. However, Robertson told Wilson directly in a meeting on 4 July that there was simply no job available for him. Moreover, Wilson was surprised to learn that if he entered the House of Commons he would lose his army half pay.

====Eastern Command====
With the Third Battle of Ypres, to which the War Cabinet had reluctantly agreed on condition that it did not degenerate into a long-drawn out fight like the Somme, already bogged down in unseasonably early wet weather, Viscount French (14 August 1917) told Riddell (managing director of the &quot;News of the World&quot;, and likely to pass on French&#x27;s views to Lloyd George) that Henry Wilson&#x27;s talents were being wasted, and that the government was not ascertaining &quot;the views of our leading soldiers&quot;. Wilson thought &quot;ridiculous and unworkable&quot; a suggestion by Lloyd George that all Robertson&#x27;s plans be submitted to a committee of French, Wilson and one other, and over lunch with French and Lloyd George on 23 August suggested an inter-Allied body of three Prime Ministers and three soldiers be set up over all the national Staffs. Lloyd George agreed, telling Wilson that he should be the British military member, and told him to sell the plan to the rest of the War Cabinet. Wilson also suggested that the autumn and winter mud in Flanders would be an ideal time to build on recent successes in Palestine and Mesopotamia without interfering with Western Front Offensives in 1918.

In late August 1917 Wilson turned down a chance to go on the mission to the US, as he did not get on with Lord Northcliffe, the mission leader. He took up Eastern Command, whose headquarters were conveniently at 50 Pall Mall in London, on 1 September 1917, enabling him to work closely with Prime Minister David Lloyd George.

The War Cabinet (11 October 1917) invited Wilson and French to submit formal written advice, a blatant undermining of Robertson&#x27;s position. Dining with Wilson and French the night before, Lloyd George criticised Robertson and called Haig&#x27;s recent paper (8 October), which predicted that &quot;decisive success is expected next year&quot; provided Russia continued to pin down as many German divisions as currently, &quot;preposterous&quot;. Wilson consulted Macdonogh (Director of Military Intelligence at the War Office) who held out little prospect of breaking the German Army but thought &quot;the heart of the German people&quot; might break in a year, and Macready (Adjutant-General) who warned that the British Army was facing a shortfall of 300,000 men by that time. Over lunch on 17 October Lloyd George wanted Wilson&#x27;s paper rewritten to remove &quot;all semblance of dictation&quot; by the new inter-Allied body. Wilson thought Haig&#x27;s assumption that Russia would continue to fight was &quot;a large one&quot; and once again urged winter offensives against Turkey and Bulgaria. He affirmed that he was in principle a &quot;Westerner&quot; but wrote that it was &quot;no use throwing &quot;decisive numbers at the decisive time at the decisive place&quot; if &quot;the decisive numbers do not exist, the decisive hour has not yet struck and if the decisive place is ill-chosen&quot; &quot;. Winston Churchill later wrote &quot;In Sir Henry Wilson the War Cabinet found for the first time an expert advisor of superior intellect, who could explain lucidly and forcefully the whole situation and give reasons for the adoption or rejection of any course&quot;.

Wilson delivered copies of the two papers to Hankey on 20 October; on 24 October Wilson breakfasted with Derby, who warned him that he had not yet submitted the papers as French&#x27;s was &quot;too personal&quot; and Wilson&#x27;s &quot;too unanswerable&quot;. At the Prime Minister&#x27;s request Wilson helped tone down French&#x27;s criticisms of Robertson. On 26 October papers were at last sent to the CIGS, having been overtaken by disaster on the Italian front. The Battle of Caporetto began on 24 October, which Wilson was worried might lead to revolution in Italy.

====Supreme War Council====
Lloyd George told Wilson that he was to be the British Military Representative on the Supreme War Council, and that although he disliked his politics he admired him &quot;as a man &amp; a soldier&quot; and that the future of the war rested in his shoulders – Milner told him much the same, adding that it was &quot;the eleventh hour&quot;. Hankey also wrote to Lloyd George that Wilson was uniquely qualified for the job, owing in part to his close relations with the French Army and personal friendship with Foch. Wilson accompanied Lloyd George, Smuts and Hankey to the Rapallo Conference which set up the SWC (7 November). When he arrived on 5 November he met Robertson who had gone on ahead to supervise the transfer of British reinforcements to Italy – under questioning from Wilson Robertson said that he would not have done anything differently over the last two years – which Wilson thought &quot;curious&quot;, noting that &quot;since he has been CIGS we have lost Roumania, Russia &amp; Italy &amp; have gained Bullecourt, Messines &amp; Paschendal [sic]&quot;.

Wilson, sent to inspect the Italian Front, was worried that Venice might fall and on behalf of the SWC ordered the new Italian commander Diaz to construct new defensive positions on the River Brenta, which in the event were not needed as the line of the River Piave held.

Lloyd George persuaded the War Cabinet that although Wilson was subject to the authority of the Army Council he should nonetheless have &quot;unfettered&quot; discretion as to the advice he gave. Wilson insisted to Robertson that there was no &quot;duality of advice&quot; as he spoke only on behalf of the SWC. Lloyd George also asked Wilson to send his reports directly to him, not through Robertson. On the train to the initial SWC meeting at the Hotel Trianon at Versailles Lloyd George, Milner and Wilson had &quot;long talks&quot; about Derby and Robertson&#x27;s obstruction. Wilson correctly guessed that Foch would eventually become Allied generalissimo. Clemenceau was in the chair (1 December 1917), and his speech, drafted by Hankey, tasked the military representatives with studying the prospects for the 1918 campaign, and in particular whether German defeat would be best brought about by attacks on her allies.

At the time, Allenby&#x27;s successes, culminating in the Fall of Jerusalem (9 December 1917), demonstrated the potential of attacks in the Middle East, compared to Haig&#x27;s offensives at Ypres and at Cambrai in November (initial British success followed by German retaking of gains). Russia had finally collapsed (Brest Litovsk Armistice 16 December) yet only a handful of American divisions were available so far in the west. But with hindsight, it is unclear that stronger commitment to the Palestine front in the winter of 1917–18 would have led to great results, as that winter saw some of the heaviest rain in the region in living memory. Conversely, the success of the German 1918 Spring Offensives demonstrated that the Western Front was not as secure as Wilson believed.

In December 1917 Wilson was given the temporary rank of general.

The military representatives, egged on by Wilson, beginning 13 December 1917, recommended coordinated defence and reserves from the North Sea to the Adriatic, as well as reorganisation of the Belgian Army and preparing studies of the Italian and Salonika fronts. Wilson worked even on Christmas Day. He set up three main sections &quot;Allied&quot; and &quot;Enemy&quot; operations, and &quot;Material and Manpower&quot; – the latter under Frederick Sykes covered both sides and included air power. There was also a &quot;Political&quot; Branch under Leo Amery, although he reported to Hankey back in London. However, Rawlinson was unimpressed by the calibre of Wilson&#x27;s staff and the young Archibald Wavell thought the atmosphere overly pessimistic. That month Wilson defended Haig to Clemenceau and Foch, both of whom wanted him removed (Clemenceau preferred Allenby as Haig&#x27;s replacement, Foch preferred Plumer), telling Clemenceau that Haig was the right man for the &quot;bad times&quot; which were coming, although he was critical of Robertson.

Wilson had his staff play a &quot;war game&quot;, in which some of them had reversed their hats pretending to be German, which he demonstrated to important visitors and the contents of which became Joint Note 12. Wilson advised that the British line should be extended between the River Ailette and the Soissons-Laon Road. Haig was bored when shown it (11 January 1918) and read a memorandum in his hand, although a large part of the reason for setting up the SWC had been the poor intelligence and advice which Haig had been receiving from Charteris. Many of Wilson&#x27;s predictions for the timing and location of the German offensive proved to be wrong. Although Lloyd George would later (9 April) praise Wilson in the House of Commons for forecasting the date and time of the German offensive, he had in fact explicitly rejected the Somme as a sector and had predicted that 1 May or later would be the likely date of the attack.

SWC Joint Note 12 declared that, leaving aside improbables such as Central Powers internal collapse or Russian revival, neither side could win a decisive victory on the Western Front in 1918, although decisive results could be had against Turkey (although, at French insistence, no further troops were to be sent), possibly leading to diversion of German troops and encouragement of pro-Allied elements in Romania and southern Russia. Haig thought &quot;Wilson is playing the tune called by Lloyd George&quot; and Robertson, who opposed efforts against Turkey, thought it &quot;d-----d rot in general&quot;. Joint Note 12 and Note 14 proposing the formation of a General Reserve were discussed at the second full session of the SWC (30 January – 2 February). In accordance with Lloyd George&#x27;s wishes an Executive Board was set up to control the General Reserve, under Foch (with Wilson as his deputy). Robertson asked to be on the Board but was overruled. Wilson for the first time (2 February 1918) wrote explicitly in his diary of &quot;the long duel between (himself) and Robertson&quot; and speculated that Robertson might resign after his &quot;complete defeat&quot;.

Wilson seems from his diary not to have particularly welcomed the suggestion that he become CIGS. When told by Milner of rumours that he was to be given Robertson&#x27;s job he said that he preferred to be given ever more power at Versailles where he was building up a prestigious post for himself, with Robertson reduced &quot;from the position of a Master to that of a servant&quot;. Milner told Wilson (10 February) that Lloyd George wanted to move Robertson to Versailles. Ironically, if he became CIGS he wanted Robertson (whom he thought would refuse) or whoever else replaced him at Versailles to report to himself. There was talk of the government falling, Rawlinson writing to H. A. Gwynne (14 February 1918) that the best solution was to give Robertson a powerful role at Versailles and have Wilson as a weak CIGS in London &quot;where he will not be able to do much mischief – especially if Squiff replaced LG as PM&quot;.

===Chief of the Imperial General Staff: 1918===
====German March offensive====
On 19 February 1918 Wilson was appointed Chief of the Imperial General Staff (&#x27;CIGS&#x27;), and was the principal military adviser to Lloyd George in the last year of the war. As CIGS, he was a member of the Army Council. One of his first acts was to nearly triple the size of the Tank Corps from 18,000 to 46,000 men He argued for &quot;turning out some of our senior generals &amp; starting a flow of promotion&quot;. A purge of corps commanders, including the corps commanders from the Battle of Cambrai (Pulteney, Snow and Woollcombe), was carried out in early 1918.

Foch was pleased at Wilson&#x27;s appointment, although Haig noted in his diary that Wilson was no longer so keen on a strong staff under Rawlinson, his successor at Versailles. Rawlinson for his part supported Haig&#x27;s unwillingness to release any divisions to the General Reserve. Petain only agreed to release 8 French divisions and made a bilateral agreement with Haig to assist one another. Wilson protested to Lloyd George, who commented that Haig&#x27;s attitude was &quot;very stupid &amp; short sighted but agreed we could not force Haig at this moment&quot;. Wilson defended Haig&#x27;s position to the War Cabinet (6 March) and blamed Clemenceau and Petain (both of whom disliked Foch). At a SWC Meeting in London (14–15 March) Foch agreed under protest to shelve the Allied Reserve.

In the House of Commons in early April Lloyd George would later claim, amidst press demands for Robertson&#x27;s restoration to office, that Wilson had predicted exactly when and where the German offensive would come. In fact on 21 March the day the German Michael Offensive began, Wilson advised that the attack &quot;might only develop into a big raid or demonstration&quot; and focussed the War Cabinet on the German threat to Asia. Although it was not yet clear in London, on that one day the Germans captured as much territory as the British had captured in 140 days at the Somme in 1916.

On 23 March Kirke, Deputy Director of Operations at GHQ, flew to London to report that the Germans had gained 12 miles and captured 600 guns. Wilson wrote that 23 March was &quot;an anxious day&quot;: the War Cabinet discussed falling back on the Channel Ports and agreed to send out 50,000 &quot;boys&quot; of 18 ½ – 19 together with another 82,000 men from Britain, along with 88,000 returning from leave. A British division was recalled from Italy, Allenby was instructed to hold another division ready, and Lord Reading (Ambassador in Washington) was asked to urge President Wilson to send US reinforcements quicker.

Wilson&#x27;s diary records that on 24 March he had a meeting with Lloyd George at Downing Street where they discussed &quot;the entirely inadequate measures taken by Haig and Petain&quot; before receiving an evening message from Haig asking him to come over. There is no evidence to confirm Haig&#x27;s later claim that, on returning from a midnight meeting with Petain at 3am on 25 March, he telegraphed to Wilson and Milner to come over to France and ensure the appointment of &quot;Foch or some other determined general who would fight&quot; as Allied Generalissimo. Wilson reached GHQ at Montreuil at 11.30am on 25 March, having left London by special train at 6.50am then crossed to France on a destroyer. He chided Haig for having, together with Petain, blocked the plan for an Allied reserve, although in fact Petain sent a dozen divisions and it is unclear that a committee would actually have acted any faster. Travers argued that the true reason for Wilson&#x27;s visit to France was to discuss a retreat on the Channel Ports, but this view is not accepted by other scholars.

Wilson was present at the Doullens conference at which Foch was appointed Allied generalissimo. He reported (27 March) that Gough&#x27;s Fifth Army could &quot;no longer be regarded as a fighting unit&quot;. He was also at the Beauvais (3 April) conference which increased Foch&#x27;s powers.

====Spring battles====

Wilson thought that Irish conscription would gain an extra 150,000 men, as well as helping to round up political malcontents. As recently as January Lloyd George had been opposed, worried that it would cause trouble in Ireland and weaken the position of John Redmond&#x27;s party (worries shared by the administration in Dublin) and about the effect on Irish American and Irish Australian opinion. During the German &quot;Michael&quot; Offensive Lloyd George changed his mind and with Milner&#x27;s support, but over the reservations of the head of the RIC, announced at the War Cabinet (25 March) that conscription was to be extended to Ireland, partly to placate British trade unions at the extension of conscription to British war industries. When he announced the measure in the House of Commons (9 April), he announced that Home Rule was also to be introduced in Ireland, although Wilson was convinced that the southern nationalists would never accept it if Ulster was given the &quot;safeguards&quot; promised by Lloyd George. Irish conscription was never implemented but the threat galvanised Irish politics and led to Sinn Féin&#x27;s victory in December 1918.

The War Cabinet met (8 April) to discuss, in Hankey&#x27;s words, &quot;the desirability of getting rid of Haig&quot;, who had recently offered to resign. Hankey recorded that sentiment was &quot;unanimously against Haig&quot; but Wilson&#x27;s opinion was that there was no obvious successor and that he suggested waiting for Haig&#x27;s report on the March retreat before making a decision. However, in his own diary Wilson later claimed (11 May) he had urged that Haig be sacked, and told Haig so (20 May). Haig and Wilson gradually established a warily respectful relationship, and Lloyd George was soon complaining that one was Scotch and one Irish, but both were whiskies.

The German &quot;Georgette&quot; Offensive began on 9 April. Wilson travelled to France and that day he met with Haig and then with Foch, with whom he broached the idea of appointing Lt-Gen Du Cane as liaison officer between the two (this would take effect on 12 April). Wilson met Clemenceau in Paris the next morning (10 April) to warn that there was a danger of the BEF losing the Channel ports. He also wrote to Foch (10 April) urging him to send French reinforcements or to flood the coastal areas around Dunkirk, and impressing on him the need to keep contact with the British right flank if the BEF felt compelled to retreat on the Channel Ports. At a meeting with Clemenceau, Foch, Milner and Haig on 27 April, Wilson pressed Foch on whether the priority was to hold onto the Channel ports or to keep the British and French armies united was priority. Foch indicated that the latter was the priority. Reassured by the British Admiralty that if necessary Calais and Boulogne could be abandoned, Wilson finally agreed (2 May 1918) that the British could retreat south-west if attacked again, but this decision never had to be implemented.

Like many British leaders, Wilson soon became disillusioned with Foch. In May 1918 he complained that the French wanted to get control of the British Army, bases, food, merchant marine, and the Italian and Salonika fronts.

====Summer battles====
Wilson, along with Milner and Hankey, was on the X Committee, an inner circle which met to brief Lloyd George prior to War Cabinet meetings. Wilson travelled to France four times, seeing Foch and Haig each time and Clemenceau on three of them. Wilson ordered detailed planning to begin for a potential evacuation of the BEF; the British Embassy in Paris packed up much of their archive in case evacuation was required.

Wilson attended the sixth meeting of the Supreme War Council in Paris, 1–3 June, at which there was much French anger at the low level of British recruitment and Haig&#x27;s reluctance to send reinforcements to the French sector.

Wilson was promoted to substantive general on 3 June 1918. Along with Hankey and Milner, Wilson attended an emergency meeting at Downing Street on 5 June, at which abandonment of the Channel Ports or even evacuation was discussed. Wilson also attended the Paris conference of 7 June, at which Foch again berated Haig for his reluctance to send reinforcements. Wilson helped to defuse the situation by obtaining a promise from Foch that the British and French Armies would not be separated as Petain had assured him that Paris was no longer in danger. At the end of June Lloyd George asked Milner if Britain could continue the war without France. Wilson visited Italy again at the end of June 1918.

For some time the Supreme War Council had been drawing up contingency plans to supply the BEF via Dieppe and Le Havre if Calais and Boulogne fell, or even emergency evacuation plans. Wilson submitted a long paper to the War Cabinet in July, recommending that the Allies hold the line, with only limited offensives, for the second half of 1918, and that their future offensives should have ever greater emphasis on artillery, tanks, aircraft and machine guns. He was convinced that the war would ultimately be won in the west. In his &quot;War Memoirs&quot; Lloyd George later poured scorn on Wilson for seeking the advice of Haig and Petain in this paper and for not having foreseen the Allied victories of autumn 1918. Wilson also dismissed as unlikely the internal collapse which overcame the Central Powers in late 1918. Wilson also wanted to reinforce the Near East – although not enough to satisfy Amery – lest Germany and Turkey were left free by the collapse of Russia to expand there, which would improve their position in any future war a decade hence. Haig wrote on his copy &quot;words, words, words&quot; and &quot;theoretical rubbish&quot;.

====Allied victory====

When Haig&#x27;s forces began to advance towards the Hindenburg Line Wilson sent him a supposedly &quot;personal&quot; telegram (31 August), warning that he was not to take unnecessary losses in storming these fortifications (i.e. hinting that he might be sacked if he failed), later claiming that the government wanted to retain troops in the UK because of the police strike.

Haig believed that the aim should be to win the war that year, and by spring 1919 at the latest, not July 1919 as the politicians had in mind, and urged that all available able-bodied men and transportation in the UK be sent, as well as men earmarked for the Royal Navy and for munitions production, even at the cost of reducing future munitions output. Milner warned Haig that manpower would not be available for 1919 if squandered now. Although Wilson agreed with Haig that &quot;there was ample evidence of the deterioration of the Boch&quot; (Wilson diary 9 September) Milner told Wilson that Haig was being &quot;ridiculously optimistic&quot;, might &quot;embark on another Paschendal [sic]&quot; and that he &quot;had grave doubts whether he had got inside of DH&#x27;s head&quot; (Wilson diary 23 September); Wilson thought the War Cabinet would have to &quot;watch this tendency &amp; stupidity of DH&quot;.

Wilson was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) on 17 December 1918.

==Postwar Chief of the Imperial General Staff==

===Demobilisation and defence cuts===
In January 1919 there were riots as 10,000 soldiers at Folkestone and 2,000 at Dover refused to return abroad, as well as disturbances in army camps abroad. This was of grave concern as revolution in Russia and Germany had been spearheaded by mutinous soldiers. Wilson, aware that peace had not yet been signed, blamed Lloyd George for promising quick demobilisation during the 1918 General Election campaign, and estimating that 350,000–500,000 men would be needed for peacekeeping duties, pressed for the continuation of conscription, despite press pressure, e.g. from the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, that it should end. Churchill (now War Secretary) replaced the existing plans for demobilisation of men with jobs to go to with a new system of &quot;first in, first out&quot;, and extended service for the most recent conscripts until April 1920 so that current soldiers could be demobilised.

The Army dropped in size from 3.8 million men (November 1918) to 2 million at the start of 1919, then 890,000 (November 1919) then 430,000 (November 1920). Lloyd George, wanting to spend more money on domestic programmes and concerned at persuading an electorate recently tripled in size that high defence spending was needed, launched a defence review in summer 1919 after peace was signed. He wanted to know why, with no major enemies on the horizon, so many more men were needed than in 1914 when the Army had numbered 255,000. Defence spending was £766m in 1919–20, this was to be reduced to £135m of which £75m was to be on the army and air force. Wilson supported the Ten Year Rule which was also formulated at this time.

===Versailles Treaty===
Wilson, at this stage still enjoying cordial relations with Lloyd George, was Britain&#x27;s chief military adviser at the Paris Peace Conference. Wilson advised that the German Reichswehr be a voluntary rather than a conscript force (the French preference), and that the French Occupation of the Rhineland be temporary rather than permanent. Hankey was impressed by advice from Wilson that harsh financial terms might drive Germany to Bolshevism and thence to alliance with Russia and Japan, and had Wilson repeat his presentation to the Prime Minister at a special &quot;away weekend&quot; at Fontainebleau (March 1919), where he was sceptical of the League of Nations and urged a strong Anglo-French Alliance. These proposals were written up as the &quot;Fontainebleau Memorandum&quot; outlining Lloyd George&#x27;s preferred peace terms. Clemenceau eventually agreed to sign the Treaty of Versailles on condition Britain guaranteed to defend France against unprovoked German aggression.

===Promotion and honours===
On 31 July 1919, Wilson was promoted to field marshal, after Churchill had offered him a choice of promotion or a peerage. At a dinner for 200 MPs in Wilson&#x27;s honour, Lloyd George stated that Wilson had earned the promotion for his role in war preparation, for his work in smoothing Anglo-French relations, and for his work in setting up a unified Allied command late in the war. At 55 he was the youngest non-royal field marshal since Wellington (Harold Alexander in 1944 has since been younger). Private A S Bullock, a port official at Le Havre, recalled Wilson, a tall man, arriving at his office with his assistant General Walter Pitt-Taylor and lounging across a doorway because Bullock, unaware of his identity, failed to offer him a seat!

Wilson was also made a baronet. He was appointed a Grand Officier of the Belgian Order of Leopold and awarded the Belgian Croix de guerre, and was given the Chinese Order of Chia-Ho (Golden Grain), 1st Class &quot;Ta-Shou Pao-Kuang&quot;, the American Distinguished Service Medal, the Siamese Order of the White Elephant, first class, the Grand Cordon of the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun (later &quot;with flowers of the Paulownia&quot;), the Grand Cross of the Greek Order of the Redeemer, and promoted to Grand Cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

Wilson received a grant of £10,000 (his field marshal&#x27;s pay was £3,600 per annum). Money was still tight – in the summer of 1920 he briefly let out his house at Eaton Place. Over the next few years he received honorary degrees from Oxford, Cambridge, Trinity College Dublin and Queens University Belfast. His estate at his death was £10,678, which included his yacht worth nearly £2,000. 

When he took his GCB he had as supporters on his coat of arms a private of the Rifle Brigade and a female figure representing Ulster.

===Labour unrest and Anglo-Soviet trade talks===
A wave of labour unrest had begun with the London police strike of August 1918. Wilson had approved the deployment of troops as strike breakers in September 1918 but regretted the concessions granted to striking railwaymen in December 1918. 
During another railway strike in September 1919, Wilson was concerned he would be left with only 40,000 infantry of whom 12,000 were conscripts, and of which even the &quot;regular&quot; NCOs were young and inexperienced – a police report at the time warned that for the first time in British history the rioters (many of them ex-soldiers) would be better trained than the authorities. Wilson, along with Churchill and Walter Long (First Lord of the Admiralty), wanted military action. Lloyd George, Bonar Law and Hankey did not. Early in 1920 Wilson drew up plans for 18 battalions to protect London, concentrating troops near the sea so they could be moved by the navy rather than by rail.

Wilson privately suspected Lloyd George of being &quot;a traitor &amp; a Bolshevist&quot;. He was particularly concerned by the presence in May of a Soviet trade delegation led by Krasin. This was against the backdrop of the Battle of Warsaw in summer 1920.

By September 1920 a national coal strike seemed imminent, along with possible involvement by railwaymen and transport workers (the &quot;Triple Alliance&quot;) and unrest amongst unemployed ex-servicemen, coinciding with rebellion in Mesopotamia and Egypt. Tanks were deployed to Worcester, York, Aldershot and Scotland. By 31 December 1920 Wilson thought that Lloyd George was, for reasons which included his attempt at détente with the Soviets, &quot;totally unfit to govern&quot;. The Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement was eventually signed on 16 March 1921.

Wilson was particularly cross, early in 1921, that with only 10 Guards and 18 Line (8 of them Irish) battalions in the UK to meet another threatened Triple Alliance strike, 4 battalions were being sent from the Rhine to supervise the Upper Silesia plebiscite: he asked Lloyd George if he wanted to be &quot;Prime Minister of England or Silesia&quot;. The Cabinet eventually agreed to let Wilson recall battalions from Silesia, Malta and Egypt, mobilise sailors and an 80,000 strong paramilitary &quot;Defence Force&quot;. In the event the miners struck without the support of other unions (&quot;Black Friday&quot;), and the sharp slump took the sting out of labour unrest.

===World commitments===
Wilson wanted to concentrate troops in Britain, Ireland, India and Egypt – rather than what he saw as excessive commitments to the Rhine and in Mesopotamia, Persia and Palestine. He favoured limited involvement in the Russian Civil War, agreeing with Lloyd George that Churchill&#x27;s desire to wage active war on Bolshevik Russia was unwise and impractical. Rawlinson was sent out in August 1919 to supervise British withdrawal.

An entire British division had occupied Batum on the Black Sea supervising German and Turkish withdrawal. Wilson thought the Caucasus &quot;a nest&quot; and wrote a paper which Churchill circulated to the Cabinet (3 May 1919) urging retreat from non-vital parts of the world. At the end of August 1919 the British withdrew from Baku on the Caspian. In February 1920 Wilson persuaded the Cabinet to withdraw the remaining 3 battalions from Batum, but the Foreign Secretary Curzon had the decision reversed on his return from holiday, although to Curzon&#x27;s fury Wilson gave the local commander permission to withdraw if necessary. After a British garrison at Enzeli (on the Persian Caspian coast) was taken prisoner by Bolshevik forces on 19 May 1920, Lloyd George finally insisted on abandonment of Batum early in June 1920. Churchill and Wilson opposed Curzon&#x27;s aspirations for a permanent British presence in Persia, and financial retrenchment forced a British withdrawal in the spring of 1921.

By February 1920 Wilson&#x27;s Staff wanted to reduce commitment to Mesopotamia, despite inevitable loss of prestige, as occupation of the whole country was not necessary to safeguard the southern Persian oilfields. When revolt broke out in Mesopotamia, Wilson asked (15 July 1920) to pull out of Persia to send reinforcements, but Lloyd George said that Curzon &quot;would not stand it&quot;. By October 1920 the local British commander Sir Aylmer Haldane managed to restore order but on 10 December Wilson minuted his agreement to an appraisal by the Director of Military Operations that &quot;we ran things too fine and that a great disaster was only narrowly avoided&quot;. Wilson was privately scathing about what he called &quot;Hot Air, Aeroplanes &amp; Arabs&quot; – Trenchard&#x27;s plan for Air Defence backed by Arab levies, announced by Churchill at the Cairo Conference in July 1921 – although glad at the reduction in military commitment. Wilson and his staff did not agree with Lloyd George&#x27;s insistence on retaining an occupation force in Turkey and his support for Greek territorial ambitions in Asia Minor (Treaty of Sèvres, 1920).

Wilson was pro-Zionist after a meeting with Chaim Weizmann in May 1919, believing that Jews could police the area for Britain. He wanted to withdraw from the British Mandate of Palestine (which at that time included the Emirate of Transjordan), as Britain did not have the troops to keep both Jews and Arabs under its thumb.

Wilson wanted to retain Egypt as part of the British Empire. After a nationalist rising in the spring of 1919 Milner was appointed to head an inquiry, and in summer 1920 he proposed that Egypt be granted autonomy. Wilson agreed with Churchill, who thought that granting Egypt sovereign independence would set a bad example for India and Ireland. The Allenby Declaration of February 1922 was based on the Milner proposals whilst reserving Britain&#x27;s &quot;special interest&quot; in the country. Wilson was concerned about the British garrison being restricted to the Suez Canal area and wrote that &quot;the white flag is once more up over 10 Downing Street&quot;.

===Ireland===

====Escalating crisis====
Wilson wrote to Robertson (13 June 1919) that &quot;Ireland goes from bad to worse and&quot; that &quot;a little bloodletting&quot; was needed, but in 1919 the fighting was sporadic and highly localised, seemingly no worse than in the land agitation of the early 1880s. 15 police (out of 9,000 RIC) were killed in 1919, and Ireland was at first very low down the UK political agenda.

In October 1919 Wilson warned Churchill that the planned introduction of Irish Home Rule that autumn would lead to trouble and, given concerns that Robertson lacked the subtlety for the Irish Command which Churchill had offered him, asked him to consult the Prime Minister, perhaps in the knowledge that Lloyd George disliked Robertson. Lloyd George preferred Macready, as he had experience of peacekeeping duties in South Wales and Belfast as well as having served as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London, and he was appointed early in 1920.

The Cabinet agreed (11 May 1920) to Macready&#x27;s request for vehicles and extra technical personnel, but on Wilson&#x27;s advice agreed only to hold the 8 requested extra battalions &quot;in readiness&quot;. Churchill proposed a force of 8,000 old soldiers be raised to reinforce the RIC, but Wilson thought this force of &quot;scallywags&quot; (the Auxiliary Division as it became, whose numbers peaked at 1,500 in July 1921) would be ill-trained, poorly led and split up into small groups across Ireland, fears which proved wholly justified. Wilson would have preferred a special force of 8 &quot;Garrison Battalions&quot; under full military discipline, and a robust military campaign in Ireland, which he regarded as a proxy war for anti-British movements in &quot;New York &amp; Cairo &amp; Calcutta &amp; Moscow&quot;, but this was politically unacceptable. Wilson is sometimes credited with creating the Cairo Gang – there is no evidence for this, and indeed the gang may not even have existed.

Wilson became increasingly concerned that Henry Hugh Tudor, with the connivance of Lloyd George, who loved to drop hints to that effect, was operating an unofficial policy of killing IRA men in reprisal for the deaths of pro-Crown forces. Wilson wrote to Macready (June 1920) that &quot;the discipline and good name of the Army is worth half a dozen Irelands&quot; – although sympathetic, he had been deeply concerned to hear of troops smashing up Fermoy in reprisal for the kidnapping of General Cuthbert. However, Macready also told Wilson that the Army was arranging &quot;accidents&quot; for suspected IRA men, but not telling the politicians as he did not want them &quot;talked and joked about after dinner by Cabinet Ministers&quot;. Lloyd George refused to formally declare martial law, not least because in July 1920 the Amritsar Massacre (of April 1919) was being debated by Parliament.

====Martial law====
With the army stretched very thin by the deployment of two extra divisions to Iraq, and the threatened coal strike in September 1920, Wilson wanted to withdraw ten battalions from Ireland, but Macready warned this would make peacekeeping of Ireland impossible unless the Army was given a free hand to conduct purely military operations. Amidst concerns that police and army discipline would not stay firm indefinitely, Wilson therefore recommended martial law that month, although he also stressed that it needed to have full and open political support. Wilson wanted lists of known Sinn Féiners published on church doors and wanted to &quot;shoot (five IRA men for each policeman killed) by roster seeing that we cannot get evidence&quot;.

After the Bloody Sunday assassination of a dozen British officers (21 November 1920) Wilson urged martial law on Churchill &quot;for the hundredth time&quot;. After the killing of 17 Auxiliaries in an ambush at Kilmichael, near Macroom, County Cork, martial law was declared (10 December 1920 – Wilson called Churchill and Hamar Greenwood &quot;amazing liars&quot; in his diary for saying they had always been in favour of it) in the four Munster Counties of Cork, Tipperary, Kerry and Limerick – Wilson would have preferred all of Ireland apart from Ulster. On 23 December Irish Home Rule became law. Wilson attended a special conference (29 December) along with Macready, Tudor and John Anderson (Head of the Civil Service in Dublin) at which they all advised that no truce should be allowed for elections to the planned Dublin Parliament, and that at least four months (Wilson thought six) months of martial law would be required to restore order – the date for the elections was therefore set for May 1921. In accordance with Wilson and Macready&#x27;s wishes martial law was extended over the rest of Munster (Counties Waterford and Clare) and part of Leinster (Counties Kilkenny and Wexford).

In February 1921 a new Secretary of State for War, Laming Worthington-Evans, was more willing to listen to Wilson&#x27;s advice. The Irish War of Independence reached a climax in the first half of 1921, with deaths of pro-Crown forces running at approximately double the rate of those in the second half of 1920. Wilson still urged unity of military and police command, which Macready did not want.

In April 1921 the Cabinet decided, against Wilson&#x27; advice, to withdraw 4 of Macready&#x27;s 51 battalions, to meet the possible Triple Alliance strike. Wilson drew up plans to send an extra 30 battalions to suppress Ireland once the strike and the Irish elections were out of the way, not least as troops would otherwise need to be replaced after the strain of guerrilla war. In the event 17 battalions were sent (bringing British strength up to 60,000) in June and July, but the politicians drew back from the brink and began secret talks with James Craig and Éamon de Valera.

====Truce====
Wilson thought the Truce of 11 July 1921 &quot;rank, filthy cowardice&quot; and hoped it would break down, so that an extra 30,000 troops could be sent to crush Sinn Féin, and thought Lloyd George&#x27;s plan to withdraw from the interior and control major cities and ports (&quot;withdrawal and blockade&quot;) &quot;as ridiculous as it was impossible&quot;.

In June 1921 Lloyd George complained that he could &quot;never get a sane discussion&quot; with Wilson. When Wilson told him that he &quot;did not speak to murderers&quot; and would hand de Valera over to the police on his forthcoming visit to London the Prime Minister replied &quot;Oh nonsense. In public life we must do these things&quot;. This appears to have been the final break between Wilson and Lloyd George – despite the urgings of Worthington-Evans Wilson did not meet the Prime Minister again until 10 February 1922. Wilson thought the Irish Treaty a &quot;shameful &amp; cowardly surrender to the pistol&quot; by a &quot;Cabinet of Cowards&quot; and, correctly predicting civil war in Ireland, was keen to get out before &quot;one set of murderers&quot; (the Irish government) asked for British military aid against &quot;another set of murderers&quot;.

On 3 August 1921 Wilson, who had been elected a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron the previous year, almost drowned in a yachting accident.

Wilson&#x27;s last act as CIGS (January 1922) was to argue against Geddes&#x27; recommendation of further army cuts of 50,000 men and £20m off the £75m estimates. The proposed cuts were scaled back after a review by Churchill, former War Secretary.

==Member of Parliament and Ulster adviser==
Wilson was offered a seat in the devolved Northern Ireland parliament and a probable ministerial post at Stormont. There was also talk of an English seat, but he agreed to stand (for Westminster) for North Down, provided it was only for one parliament, that he was unopposed and that it only cost him £100-£200. He was also advised that a parliamentary seat would make it easier to pick up company directorships.

He resigned from the army, being replaced as CIGS by The Earl of Cavan on 19 February 1922, and was elected on 21 February 1922. Although the Conservatives were still officially supporting the Lloyd George Coalition, Wilson wrote that all his energies would be devoted to overthrowing the present government. He spoke seven times as an MP, twice on the army estimates and five times on Ireland.

Sir James Craig invited Wilson to advise the Northern Ireland government on security. At a conference on St Patrick&#x27;s Day 1922 Wilson advised an increase in the Special Constabulary, but urged that loyal Catholics be encouraged to join, rather than keeping it a purely Protestant body (Craig did not pass on this recommendation to the Stormont Cabinet). He also advised that an able army officer be appointed to take command of the Constabulary, to avoid a poorly run force alienating public opinion as the Black and Tans had done. Wilson was unimpressed by Craig (whom he thought &quot;very second rate … self-satisfied, lazy &amp; bad judge of men &amp; events&quot;) and other members of the Northern Ireland administration. However, in the first half of 1922 an undeclared war was under way in Northern Ireland and
in Nationalist eyes Wilson was blamed for the Constabulary&#x27;s stance in the sectarian violence, Michael Collins calling him &quot;a violent Orange partisan&quot;. 

Anthony Heathcote writes that Wilson proposed a re-organisation of the police and military forces in Northern Ireland into an army to reconquer the south.

==Assassination==
On 22 June 1922, two London-based members of the Irish Republican Army, Reginald Dunne and Joseph O&#x27;Sullivan, assassinated Wilson outside his house at 36 Eaton Place at approximately 2:20 pm. He was in full uniform as he was returning from unveiling the Great Eastern Railway War Memorial at Liverpool Street station at 1:00 pm. He had six wounds, two of them fatal, to the chest.

Stories later circulated that the first shot missed, but rather than taking shelter in the house, he drew his sword and advanced on his attackers, who were able to shoot and kill him. These stories often stressed that he had died a martyr. His housemaid testified that she found his drawn sword lying by his side. 

These details are not in the three witness accounts quoted by Keith Jeffery (Reginald Dunne&#x27;s account smuggled out of prison, or the inquest testimonies of one of two road menders working nearby and of the taxi driver who had just dropped Wilson off). One of the road menders&#x27; accounts, as published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, mentions Wilson turning on his attackers with the words &quot;you cowardly swine!&quot; but Jeffery suggests this was an embellishment by the newspaper.

Two police officers and a chauffeur were also shot as the men attempted to avoid capture. They were then surrounded by a crowd and arrested by other policemen after a struggle. Dunne and O&#x27;Sullivan (who while serving as a British soldier had lost a leg in World War I) were captured by an angry crowd. Dunne (also a combat veteran of the British Army) had returned to try to help O&#x27;Sullivan. He was also captured after shooting and wounding two police officers and a passerby. Convicted of murder, both men were hanged on 10 August 1922.

Wilson had regarded himself as Irish and to the end of his life Currygrane, County Longford was the first address in his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry. In early July 1919 Wilson, in uniform and in an open car, had still been able to drive his mother there, the last time he ever visited the place. During the War of Independence, the IRA had taken the family guns and the house had been taken over by Auxiliaries. By 1921, he and his brothers had all had to leave, unable to access papers and valuables, his brother Jemmy living in impecunious circumstances at Rye in Sussex (Wilson had to pay for the schooling of Jemmy&#x27;s daughter) and it was unsafe for Wilson even to book a ferry crossing to Dublin under his own name. On the day Wilson&#x27;s killers were hanged, Currygrane was burned to the ground, possibly as a reprisal although possibly as an unrelated part of the unrest in that county. Referring to Wilson in his statement before execution, Dunne said: &quot;He was at the time of his death the Military Advisor to what is colloquially called the Ulster Government, and as Military Advisor he raised and organized a body of men known as the Ulster Special Constabulary, who are the principal agents in his reign of terror.&quot;

===Alleged Michael Collins involvement===
T. Ryle Dwyer suggests that the shooting of Wilson was ordered by Irish Free State General and Commander-in-Chief Michael Collins in retaliation for the continuing troubles in Northern Ireland. He returned to Dublin before the incident and jubilantly announced the news to the appalled defence minister, Richard Mulcahy, who threatened to resign. By 1923 Scotland Yard investigations centred around the involvement of Sam Maguire, Collins&#x27;s chief intelligence officer in London. Maguire was tipped off and fled to Dublin.

According to an associate of Collins, Joseph Sweeney, after the shooting of Wilson he saw Collins looking &quot;very pleased&quot; and asked &quot;where do we stand on the shooting?&quot; Collins replied &quot;It was two of ours that did it&quot;. He then told Sweeney that he had told Tom Cullen, a colleague of Collins, to plan a rescue attempt but that such an attempt was impossible.

However, this claim has been challenged by Peter Hart. According to Hart any order to assassinate Wilson would have had to have been relayed to them by Rory O&#x27;Connor (then in charge of British IRA operations) and the last assassination attempt contrived against Wilson had been set to be executed in 1921, not 1922. Tim Pat Coogan has suggested that Reginald Dunne, who had the confidence of both Michael Collins and Rory O&#x27;Connor, undertook the shooting as a last-ditch effort to provoke the British Government into retaliating, thereby uniting both sides of the Nationalists. The killers had only decided to attack the previous evening, and even on the day Sullivan had been at work until 1pm; the killers had no getaway plan.

===Government reaction===
The guns used by the assassins were sent to David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill in 
the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street; &quot;There was no Henry Wilson. The Prime Minister and I faced each other, and on the table between us lay the pistols which an hour before had taken this loyal man&#x27;s life&quot;. The House of Commons was immediately adjourned as a mark of respect and King George V sent his equerry, Colonel Arthur Erskine, to Eaton Place to convey the royal sympathy to Lady Wilson. A dinner to celebrate the Prince of Wales&#x27;s birthday, arranged at Buckingham Palace for the evening, was also cancelled.

Cabinet Ministers held a conference at 10 Downing Street on 5pm on the day of the assassination. They suspected Anti-Treaty forces (who had recently seized the Four Courts in Dublin) might be responsible – this was in fact not the case – and thought the Irish Provisional Government &quot;should be pressed to deal with the matter&quot;. Macready was summoned to London, where he found the Cabinet worried about their personal safety but also keen for a dramatic gesture of retaliation, and was asked whether it was possible for British troops to seize the Four Courts – he said that it was but cautioned against precipitate action which might reunite the two Irish factions, and on his return to Dublin deliberately delayed taking such action. Nonetheless, suspicion of Anti-Treaty complicity in Wilson&#x27;s murder, and perceived British pressure to do something about it, was one of several triggers of the Irish Civil War.

The assassination was greeted with horror in the UK, and compared to the Phoenix Park killings of 1882, which had – it was said – set back the cause of Irish Home Rule by a generation. It was the first assassination of an MP since Prime Minister Spencer Perceval in 1812 and the last until Airey Neave&#x27;s assassination by the INLA in 1979.

===Funeral===
Wilson&#x27;s widow blamed the government for his death – when Conservative leader Austen Chamberlain called on the evening of his death to offer his condolences, he was by one account greeted by her with the word &quot;murderer&quot; and by another simply asked to leave by Wilson&#x27;s niece – and she was only persuaded to allow government representation at the funeral on the grounds that not to do so would be disrespectful to the King. Wilson&#x27;s mother wrote to Bonar Law (former Conservative leader and increasingly seen as an alternative if the Coalition ended) complaining that, in a noisy Commons debate, Lloyd George had claimed to have been a personal friend of Wilson&#x27;s.

Wilson&#x27;s funeral was a public affair attended by Lloyd George and the cabinet, Foch, Nivelle and Weygand from France as well as many of his former army colleagues including French, Macready, Haig and Robertson. The field marshal was buried in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Assessments==
===Personality===
Wilson was widely regarded by his contemporaries as a charming man, describing him as a &quot;delightful whirlwind&quot; and writing that &quot;there was something spectacular and theatrical about him&quot;. Many politicians enjoyed his levity – Kiggell said he was the only general who could talk to the &quot;Frocks&quot; on level terms – as did the French, who called him &quot;Général Double-Vé&quot; (&quot;General W&quot;). Some senior British officers believed that his sympathy for the French amounted almost to treason.

Wilson&#x27;s popularity was not universal, however: Sir Sam Fay, a railway official who worked at the War Office 1917–19, enjoyed cordial face-to-face relations with Wilson but wrote that he could argue with total conviction that a horse chestnut was the same thing as a chestnut horse, and that an unnamed senior general said he suffered a &quot;sexual disturbance&quot; whenever he came within a mile of a politician (Fay recorded that the general had in fact used &quot;vulgar and obscene&quot; language – Walter Reid simply writes that exposure to politicians gave Wilson an erection). Edward Spears – also a senior Anglo-French liaison officer, but junior to Wilson – compared him to Quint, the sinister valet in Henry James&#x27; &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;.

For much of the war Wilson had a poor relationship with Haig, although relations eased somewhat when Wilson became CIGS. Esher said that he was always loyal to the man he was serving, and Walter Reid believes Wilson did not actively plot against Haig. When French asked Wilson, late in 1915, if he had heard of Haig, Rawlinson and Gough intriguing against him, Wilson replied, perhaps somewhat naively, that &quot;Haig was too good a fellow&quot; for that kind of thing. After the disaster of 1 July 1916 Wilson wrote (5 July) that Haig was &quot;a good stout hearted &quot;defensive&quot; soldier with &quot;no&quot; imagination &amp; very little brains &amp; very little sympathy&quot;. That same day Foch, who had declined an invitation from Haig to lunch with Wilson, thought Haig &quot;was stupid &amp; lacked stomach for the fight&quot; which Wilson thought &quot;not quite fair&quot;.

Haig&#x27;s private views of Wilson were less cordial: he thought him &quot;a politician, and not a soldier&quot;. After a meeting on 23 June 1916, following the failed counterattack at Vimy Ridge, Haig wrote that Wilson &quot;seems to acquire a more evil look each time I see him&quot;.

===Obituaries===

On the day of his funeral General &quot;Tim&quot; Harington held a memorial service for him at Constantinople, declaring &quot;he died for Ireland ... It may be that this sacrifice may save Ireland&quot;. Carson sent a message to the Ulster Unionist Council praising him as &quot;Ireland&#x27;s greatest son … He died for Ulster&#x27;s liberty&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; praised Wilson as &quot;a warrior Irishman&quot;. The &quot;Morning Post&quot;, a paper which strongly supported the abandoned southern Unionists, pointed out that &quot;a great Irishman&quot; had been murdered on the anniversary of King George V&#x27;s Belfast speech which had marked, as they saw it, the British &quot;surrender&quot;. However the Liberal &quot;Daily News&quot; argued that Wilson must bear some responsibility for stirring up bloodshed in Belfast of which his death was part and the &quot;New Statesman&quot; claimed that in his &quot;fanatical Orangeism&quot; and devotion to &quot;force and force alone&quot; he was the British counterpart to Cathal Brugha. Lord Milner, Irish nationalist MP T. P. O&#x27;Connor and the military correspondent Repington wrote obituaries which were generous about his warm personality, and in Repington&#x27;s case about his role in war preparations.

===Immediate assessments===
Callwell&#x27;s 2 volume &quot;Life and Diaries&quot; in 1927 damaged Wilson&#x27;s reputation – the &quot;New Statesman&quot; thought they showed him to be &quot;the typically stupid militarist…fundamentally a fool.&quot; Sir Charles Deedes, who had studied under him at Staff College and later served on his staff, commented that Wilson came across in the diaries as &quot;an ambitious, volatile and even fatuous character, an intriguer concerned mainly with his own career&quot; and that this was &quot;far from the truth&quot; – Deedes commented that Wilson&#x27;s ability to see both sides of a question and inability to make a decision and stick to it made him a poor corps commander but a &quot;patient, lucid and fair&quot; adviser. Lloyd George&#x27;s view in his own &quot;War Memoirs&quot; was essentially similar, although he wrote that Wilson was reluctant to take responsibility for decisions.

Both Archibald Wavell in the 1930s and Sir John Dill as CIGS in 1941 (who commented that he no longer condemned Wilson &quot;so heartily as one used to&quot;) commented that Wilson had illustrated that a general must be able to work effectively with politicians, and his modern biographer Keith Jeffery comments that this, rather than Robertson&#x27;s acrimonious insistence on military autonomy, has been the model since Wilson&#x27;s time.

===Policies===
Jeffery comments that for all Wilson&#x27;s reputation for intrigue he was mainly an inveterate gossip (a feature which endeared him to some politicians), whose closeness to the French alienated Robertson, and whose behaviour was no worse than the intrigues of Robertson, Haig, Rawlinson and Gough to remove Sir John French. His reputation for political intrigue was acquired for his involvement in the arguments over conscription and Ireland in 1912–14. Esher (in his life of Kitchener) later blamed Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Irish blood, exuberant with combative malice&quot; for having drawn him into the latter quarrel, which had earned him the reputation of &quot;a pestilential fellow&quot;.

Sir Charles Deedes later (in September 1968) wrote that Wilson&#x27;s energy and foresight in 1910–14 had ensured that Britain would take her place alongside France when war came. An alternative view, aired as early as the 1920s, is that Wilson locked Britain into a continental commitment which Kitchener would rather have avoided or minimised. Jeffery is critical of some historians – e.g. Zara Steiner in &quot;Britain and the Origins of the First World War&quot;, Gerhard Ritter in &quot;The Sword and the Sceptre&quot; – who take an oversimplified view of Wilson as a supporter of the French position. Although Wilson&#x27;s verbal fluency and charm brought him great influence, his position was also supported by most of his military colleagues and by the most influential members of the Cabinet. Furthermore, this ignores Wilson&#x27;s interest in reaching a military agreement with Belgium.

===Modern biographies and popular culture===
&quot;The Lost Dictator&quot; by Bernard Ash (1968) argued that had he lived Wilson might have become leader of the Tory Diehards and become a dictatorial ruler. This is implausible, as the Diehards were never more than about 50 in number and Wilson lacked the political skills or even the understated personality needed by Conservative leaders of that era.

Wilson (Michael Redgrave) features in the satirical film &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1969), travelling in a car in August 1914 with a cretinous Sir John French (Laurence Olivier) who rejects his offer to arrange an interpreter as it might breach the need for &quot;absolute secrecy&quot;, but later being passed over in favour of Robertson for a staff promotion.

For many years a portrait of Wilson by Sir Oswald Birley hung in the &quot;Prime Minister&#x27;s room&quot; at Stormont, along with a framed set of his medal ribbons left by his widow to Sir James Craig. A number of Orange lodges were named after him, although he had never joined the Orange Order.

<text>Political risk insurance is a type of insurance that can be taken out by businesses, of any size, against political risk—the risk that revolution or other political conditions will result in a loss.

Political risk insurance is available for several different types of political risk, including:
* Political violence, such as revolution, insurrection, civil unrest, terrorism or war;
* Governmental expropriation or confiscation of assets;
* Governmental frustration or repudiation of contracts;
* Wrongful calling of letters of credit or similar on-demand guarantees; 
* Business Interruption; and
* Inconvertibility of foreign currency or the inability to repatriate funds.
Political risk insurance can be provided at the international level by an international organisation, for example the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), which belongs to the World Bank Group, by states and so-called export credit agencies, or by other public agencies.

Political risk insurance claims can be categorized as inconvertibility of funds, expropriation, and violent conflict. As with any insurance, the precise scope of coverage is governed by the terms of the insurance policy. Providers of political risk insurance include public agencies and private insurance companies.

The underwriting of political risk insurance is a dynamic, growing business. As globalisation increases, there are more corporations doing more business in more places around the world with each passing year. Some of the changes occurring in the business are high growth, new product offerings, and a greater role for private capital.

While political risk insurance policies are sometimes manuscripted for specific situations, the major political risk insurers have standard forms for the coverages that they issue. For &quot;complex&quot; or larger investments manuscripted policies are the norm and there may be several insurers providing cover in the form of a syndication, through co-insurance, or perhaps with the participation of a reinsurer on a facultative basis. 

Political risk insurance claims were shown to increase with changes of political leadership in the country and violent conflict and decrease with political constraints.

<text>SS &quot;Richard Montgomery&quot; is a wrecked American Liberty ship that was built during World War II. She was named after Richard Montgomery, an Irish officer who fought in the American Revolutionary War.

She was wrecked on the Nore sandbank in the Thames Estuary, near Sheerness, Kent, England, in August 1944, while carrying a cargo of munitions. About of explosives remain on board presenting a hazard whose likelihood of explosion is variously asserted to be low to moderate.

==Construction==
&quot;Richard Montgomery&quot; was laid down on 15 March 1943 under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1199, by the St. Johns River Shipbuilding Company, Jacksonville, Florida. She was sponsored by Mrs. Rockwell, the wife of the director of MARCOM, Production Division, and was launched on 15 June 1943. She was the seventh of the 82 liberty ships built by the yard.

==Service history==
She was allocated to Agwilines Inc. on 29 July 1943. In August 1944, on what turned out to be her final voyage, the ship left Hog Island, Philadelphia, where she had been loaded with 6,127 tons of munitions.

She travelled from the Delaware River to the Thames Estuary, then anchored while awaiting the formation of a convoy to travel to Cherbourg, France, which had come under Allied control on 27 July 1944, during the Battle of Normandy.

When &quot;Richard Montgomery&quot; arrived off Southend, she came under the authority of the Thames naval control at located at the end of Southend Pier. The harbourmaster, responsible for all shipping movements in the estuary, ordered the ship to a berth off the north edge of Sheerness middle sands, an area designated as the Great Nore Anchorage.

On 20 August 1944 she dragged anchor and ran aground on a sandbank around from the Medway Approach Channel, in a depth of of water. The general dry cargo liberty ship had an average draft of , but &quot;Richard Montgomery&quot; was trimmed to a draft of . As the tide went down, the ship broke her back on sand banks near the Isle of Sheppey about from Sheerness and from Southend.

A Rochester-based stevedore company was given the job of removing the cargo, which began on 23 August 1944, using the ship&#x27;s own cargo handling equipment. By the next day, the ship&#x27;s hull had cracked open, causing several cargo holds at the bow end to flood. The salvage operation continued until 25 September, when the ship was finally abandoned before all the cargo had been recovered. Subsequently, the vessel broke into two separate parts, roughly amidships.

During the inquiry into the shipwreck, it was revealed that several ships moored nearby had noticed &quot;Richard Montgomery&quot; drifting towards the sandbank. They had attempted to signal an alert by sounding their sirens, but without avail because the ship&#x27;s chief officer neither reacted nor awoke Captain Wilkie, a failure which he was unable to explain. A board of inquiry concluded that the anchorage the harbour master assigned had placed the ship in jeopardy, and returned the captain of &quot;Richard Montgomery&quot; to full duty within a week.

==Status and risk==

According to a 2008 survey, the wreck is at a depth of , on average, and leaning to starboard. At all states of the tide, her three masts are visible above the water.

Because of the presence of the large quantity of unexploded ordnance, the ship is monitored by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and is clearly marked on the relevant Admiralty charts. In 1973, she became the first wreck designated as dangerous under section 2 of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973. There is an exclusion zone around her monitored visually and by radar. The exclusion zone around the wreck is defined by the following co-ordinates:
* 
* 

According to a survey conducted in 2000 by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the wreck still held munitions containing approximately of TNT high explosive. This comprises the following items of ordnance:
* 286 × high explosive bombs
* 4,439 × bombs of various types
* 1,925 × bombs
* 2,815 fragmentation bombs and bomb clusters
* Various explosive booster charges
* Various smoke bombs, including white phosphorus bombs
* Various pyrotechnic signals

One of the reasons that the explosives have not been removed was the unfortunate outcome of a similar operation in July 1967, to neutralize the contents of the Polish cargo ship , that sank in 1946, off Folkestone in the English Channel. During preliminary work, &quot;Kielce&quot; exploded with a force equivalent to an earthquake measuring 4.5 on the Richter scale, digging a 20-foot-deep (6 m) crater in the seabed and bringing &quot;panic and chaos&quot; to Folkestone, although there were no injuries. &quot;Kielce&quot; was at least from land, had sunk in deeper water than &quot;Richard Montgomery&quot;, and had &quot;just a fraction&quot; of the load of explosives. According to a BBC News report in 1970, it was determined that if the wreck of &quot;Richard Montgomery&quot; exploded, it would throw a -wide column of water and debris nearly into the air and generate a wave high. Almost every window in Sheerness (population circa 20,000) would be broken and buildings would be damaged by the blast. News reports in May 2012 however, including one by BBC Kent, stated that the wave could be about high, which although lower than previous estimates would be enough to cause flooding in some coastal settlements.

When the condition of the munitions was originally assessed there was concern that copper azide, an extremely sensitive explosive, would be produced through reaction between lead azide and copper from fuse components (lead azide would react with water vapour, rather than liquid water, to form hydrazoic acid, which could react with copper in the detonating cap to form copper azide).
Critics of government assurances that the likelihood of a major explosion is remote argue that one of the fuses of the 2,600 fused-fragmentation devices could become partially flooded and undergo the reaction producing copper azide. A knock, such as caused by the ship breaking up further, or a collision on the busy shipping lane, could cause the copper azide to explode and trigger an explosive chain reaction detonating the bulk of the munitions. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said in 1998, &quot;as the fuses will probably all have been flooded for many years and the sensitive compounds referred to are all soluble in water this is no longer considered to be a significant hazard&quot;. The UK government&#x27;s Receiver of Wreck commissioned a risk assessment in 1999, but this has not been published. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency convened with local and port authorities to discuss the report in 2001 and concluded that &quot;doing nothing [was] not an option for much longer&quot;. 

An investigation by &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine in 2004, based partly on government documents released in 2004, concluded that the cargo was still deadly, and could be detonated by a collision, an attack, or even shifting of the cargo in the tide. The deterioration of the bombs is so severe that they could explode spontaneously. Documents declassified shortly before revealed that the wreck was not dealt with immediately after it happened, or in the intervening 60 years, due to the expense. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency nevertheless believes that the risk of a major explosion is remote. The wreck site has been surveyed regularly since 1965 to determine the stability of the structure, with a diver survey being completed in 2003. High-resolution multi-beam sonar surveys in 2005 and September 2006 found that there had been no recent significant movement of the wreck.

Surveys undertaken in 2008 and 2009 by the MCA, showed that the ship was continuing to deteriorate structurally, with accelerated deterioration in some areas and new cracks appearing in the bow section of the wreck. The report states that &quot;Whilst significant structural collapse does not appear to be imminent, surveys suggest that this prospect is getting closer.&quot; The increasing calls for a new airport in the Thames estuary would mean a solution would have to be found for removing the wreck, or at least making it safe, should the airport be built.

The 2010 survey report, released in May 2012, found that, while there had been little change in 2009–2010, the future was uncertain due to the &quot;dynamic nature&quot; of the surrounding environment. Mayor of London Boris Johnson said that engineers had found the wreck would not prevent construction of an airport, and the wreck area would have to be considered. Julian Huppert, the co-chair of the Liberal Democrats committee on transport, disagreed, saying: &quot;This report shows the ship&#x27;s slow deterioration is continuing with the lethal cargo still on board&quot;, and &quot;This must surely put an end to the bonkers idea of building an airport in the Thames estuary.&quot; A 2013 &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; article quoting local historian Colin Harvey, agreed the ship would have to be removed before any airport was built and printed a spectrogram showing the ship clearly broken into two pieces. A Department for Transport (DfT) spokesperson said however, that the ship remained stable and the likelihood of an explosion was remote; the matter of the ship was unrelated to the ongoing development of the aviation strategy.

In June 2020, the DfT announced it was looking for a contractor to remove the ship&#x27;s three masts as they were placing undue strain on the rest of the vessel structure. The Ministry of Defence warned that the collapse of a mast could detonate ordnance, and Royal Navy specialists would need to remove them safely. In December 2021 it was reported that a contractor supported by the Navy would remove the ship&#x27;s masts, starting in June 2022. At the end of June 2022 it was reported that the work to remove the masts would be delayed another year. In June of 2023, unidentified objects found on the seabed around the ship caused the original plan to remove the masts to be deemed as too dangerous, and the removal was, again, delayed. In December of 2023, the MCA determined that the masts had degraded more than expected and scheduled their removal for March 2024. In April 2024 18 metallic objects were found around the wreck and work delayed again.

==In media==

In the second series of the Sky political thriller &quot;COBRA&quot;, broadcast in 2021, the &quot;Montgomery&quot; (unnamed in the series) explodes as a consequence of undersea earthquakes, with the consequences predicted in the 1970 BBC report: heavy flooding, property damage and great loss of life (including the local MP) in Sheerness.

In the second season of the National Geographic documentary series &quot;Drain the Oceans&quot;, broadcast in 2019, the story of the &quot;Montgomery&quot;&#x27;s sinking and the status of the wreck was the third story of an episode.

The SS &quot;Richard Montgomery&quot; was the subject of a plot line in season three of the BBC drama &quot;Waking the Dead&quot; from 2003, in the episode titled &quot;Walking on Water&quot;.

In the Indian movie Vishwaroopam II, the SS &quot;Richard Montgomery&quot; is the target of an attempted terrorist attack using cesium weapons.

<text>Leave No Trace, sometimes written as LNT, is a set of ethics promoting conservation of the outdoors. Originating in the mid-20th century, the concept started as a movement in the United States in response to ecological damage caused by wilderness recreation. In 1994, the non-profit Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics was formed to create educational resources around LNT, and organized the framework of LNT into seven principles.
# Plan ahead and prepare
# Travel and camp on durable surfaces
# Dispose of waste properly
# Leave what you find
# Minimize campfire impacts
# Respect wildlife
# Be considerate of others
The idea behind the LNT principles is to leave the wilderness unchanged by human presence.

==History==
By the 1960s and 1970s, outdoor recreation was becoming more popular, following the creation of equipment such as synthetic tents and sleeping pads. A commercial interest in the outdoors increased the number of visitors to national parks, with the National Park Service seeing a five-fold increase between 1950 and 1970, from 33 million to 172 million. Articles were written about the wild being “loved to death,” problems with overcrowding and ecological damage, and the need for management. To solve this, regulations were imposed, including limits on group sizes and where camping was allowed. This was met negatively, with people writing that it took the joy and spontaneity out of wilderness recreation.

The focus was shifted towards education, with the National Park Service (NPS), United States Forest Service (USFS), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) training Wilderness Informational Specialists to teach visitors about minimal impact camping. In 1987, the three departments cooperatively developed a pamphlet titled &quot;Leave No Trace Land Ethics&quot;.

At the same time, there was a cultural shift in outdoor ethics from woodcraft, where travelers prided themselves on their ability to use available natural resources, to having a minimal impact on the environment by traveling through wilderness as visitors. Groups such as the Sierra Club, the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS), and the Boy Scouts of America were advocating minimum impact camping techniques, and companies like REI and The North Face began sharing the movement.

In 1990, the national education program of Leave No Trace was developed by the USFS in conjunction with NOLS, alongside Smokey Bear, Woodsy Owl, and programs like Tread Lightly! geared towards motorized recreation. The Bureau of Land Management joined the program in 1993 followed by the National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1994.

The number of LNT principles varied widely during the 1990s, starting from 75 and dropping to 6 as more people had input and principles were condensed. However, by 1999, the list was finalized as seven principles and has remained unchanged.

== Principles ==

# Plan Ahead and Prepare
#* Know the regulations and special concerns for the area you&#x27;ll visit.
#* Prepare for extreme weather, hazards, and emergencies.
#* Schedule your trip to avoid times of high use.
#* Visit in small groups when possible. Consider splitting larger groups into smaller groups.
#* Repackage food to minimize waste.
#* Use a map and compass or GPS to eliminate the use of marking paint, rock cairns or flagging.
# Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces
#* Durable surfaces include maintained trails and designated campsites, rock, gravel, sand, dry grasses or snow.
#* Protect riparian areas by camping at least from lakes and streams.
#* Good campsites are found, not made. Altering a site is not necessary.
#** &quot;In popular areas:&quot;
#*** Concentrate use on existing trails and campsites.
#*** Walk single file in the middle of the trail, even when wet or muddy.
#*** Keep campsites small. Focus activity in areas where vegetation is absent.
#** &quot;In pristine areas:&quot;
#*** Disperse use to prevent the creation of campsites and trails.
#*** Avoid places where impacts are just beginning.
# Dispose of Waste Properly
#* Pack it in, pack it out. Inspect your campsite, food preparation areas, and rest areas for trash or spilled foods. Pack out all trash, leftover food and litter.
#* Utilize toilet facilities for defecation whenever possible. Otherwise, deposit solid human waste in catholes dug 6 to 8 inches deep, at least 200 feet from water, camp and trails. Cover and disguise the cathole when finished.
#* Pack out toilet paper and hygiene products.
#* To wash yourself or your dishes, carry water 200 feet away from streams or lakes and use small amounts of biodegradable soap. Scatter strained dishwater.
# Leave What You Find
#* Preserve the past: examine, photograph, but do not touch cultural or historic structures and artifacts.
#* Leave rocks, plants and other natural objects as you find them.
#* Avoid introducing or transporting non-native species.
#* Do not build structures, furniture, or dig trenches.
# Minimize Campfire Impacts
#* Campfires can cause lasting impacts to the environment. Use a lightweight stove for cooking and enjoy a candle lantern for light.
#* Where fires are permitted, use established fire rings, fire pans, or mound fires.
#* Keep fires small. Only use down and dead wood from the ground that can be broken by hand.
#* Burn all wood and coals to ash, put out campfires completely, then scatter cool ashes.
# Respect Wildlife
#* Observe wildlife from a distance. Do not follow or approach them.
#* Never feed animals. Feeding wildlife damages their health, alters natural behaviors, [habituates them to humans], and exposes them to predators and other dangers.
#* Protect wildlife and your food by storing rations and trash securely.
#* Control pets at all times, or leave them at home.
#* Avoid wildlife during sensitive times: mating, nesting, raising young, or winter.
# Be Considerate of Other Visitors
#* Respect other visitors and protect the quality of their experience.
#* Be courteous. Yield to other users on the trail.
#* Step to the downhill side of the trail when encountering pack stock.
#* Take breaks and camp away from trails and other visitors.
#* Let nature&#x27;s sounds prevail. Avoid loud voices and noises.

==Organization==
Since 1994, the Leave No Trace program has been managed by the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, dedicated to the responsible enjoyment and active stewardship of the outdoors worldwide. Leave No Trace works to build awareness, appreciation and respect for wildlands through education, research, volunteerism and partnerships. The center also has a youth education initiative, Leave No Trace for Every Kid, which emphasizes asset development in youth through the lens of outdoor stewardship.

The center has partnerships with the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, US Army Corps of Engineers, and other partners such as colleges, universities, guide services, small businesses, non-profits and youth-serving organizations such as the Boy Scouts of America and the American Camp Association.

Over 20 percent of the organization&#x27;s 2019 income went to three members of their board of directors.

There are also formal Leave No Trace organizations in Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand.

==Criticism==

While Leave No Trace is a widely accepted conservationist ethic, there has been some criticism. In 2002, environmental historian James Morton Turner argued that Leave No Trace focused &quot;largely on protecting wilderness&quot; rather than tackling questions such as the &quot;economy, consumerism, and the environment&quot;, and that it &quot;helped ally the modern backpacker with the wilderness recreation industry&quot; by encouraging backpackers to purchase products advertising Leave No Trace, or asking people to bring a petroleum stove instead of building a natural campfire.

In 2009, Gregory Simon and Peter Alagona argued that there should be a move beyond Leave No Trace, and that the ethic &quot;disguises much about human relationships with non-human nature&quot; by making it seem that parks and wilderness areas are &quot;pristine nature&quot; which &quot;erases their human histories, and prevents people from understanding how these landscapes have developed over time through complex human–environment interactions&quot;. They posit that there should be a new environmental ethic &quot;that transforms the critical scholarship of social science into a critical practice of wilderness recreation, addresses the global economic system...and reinvents wilderness recreation as a more collaborative, participatory, productive, democratic, and radical form of political action&quot;. They also write about how &quot;the LNT logo becomes both a corporate brand and an official stamp of approval&quot; in outdoor recreation stores like REI.

The authors articulate their new environmental ethic as expanding LNT, not rejecting it all together, and share the seven principles of what they call &#x27;Beyond Leave No Trace&#x27;:
# Educate yourself and others about the places you visit
# Purchase only the equipment and clothing you need
# Take care of the equipment and clothing you have
# Make conscientious food, equipment, and clothing consumption choices
# Minimize waste production
# Reduce energy consumption
# Get involved by conserving and restoring the places you visit

In 2012, in response to critiques of their 2009 article, Simon and Alagona wrote that they &quot;remain steadfast in our endorsement of LNT’s value and potential&quot; but that they believe that &quot;this simple ethic is not enough in a world of global capital circulation.&quot; They write that Leave No Trace &quot;could not exist in its current form without a plethora of consumer products;&quot; that &quot;the use of such products does not erase environmental impacts;&quot; and that LNT &quot;systematically obscures these impacts, displacements, and connections by encouraging the false belief that it is possible to &#x27;leave no trace&#x27;&quot;.

Other critics of Leave No Trace have argued that it is impractical, displaces environmental impacts to other locations, &quot;obscures connections between the uses of outdoor products and their production and disposal impacts&quot; and have questioned how much the ethic affects everyday environmental behavior.

<doc id="276702" wikidata="Q7549816" url="?curid=276702" title="Soap film">
<text>Soap films are thin layers of liquid (usually water-based) surrounded by air. For example, if two soap bubbles come into contact, they merge and a thin film is created in between. Thus, foams are composed of a network of films connected by Plateau borders. Soap films can be used as model systems for minimal surfaces, which are widely used in mathematics.

== Stability ==

Daily experience shows that soap bubble formation is not feasible with water or with any pure liquid. Actually, the presence of soap, which is composed at a molecular scale of surfactants, is necessary to stabilize the film. Most of the time, surfactants are amphiphilic, which means they are molecules with both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part. Thus, they are arranged preferentially at the air/water interface (see figure 1).

Surfactants stabilize films because they create a repulsion between both surfaces of the film, preventing it from thinning and consequentially bursting. This can be shown quantitatively through calculations relating to disjoining pressure. The main repulsion mechanisms are steric (the surfactants can not interlace) and electrostatic (if surfactants are charged).

Moreover, surfactants make the film more stable toward thickness fluctuations due to the Marangoni effect. This gives some elasticity to the interface: if surface concentrations are not homogeneously dispersed at the surface, Marangoni forces will tend to re-homogenize the surface concentration (see figure 2).

Even in the presence of stabilizing surfactants, a soap film does not last forever. Water evaporates with time depending on the humidity of the atmosphere. Moreover, as soon as a film is not perfectly horizontal, the liquid flows toward the bottom due to gravity and the liquid accumulates at the bottom. At the top, the film thins and bursts.

== Importance of surface tension: minimal surfaces ==

From a mathematical point of view, soap films are minimal surfaces. Surface tension is the energy that is required to produce the surface, per unit area. A film—like any body or structure—prefers to exist in a state of minimum potential energy. In order to minimize its energy, a droplet of liquid in free space naturally assumes a spherical shape, which has the minimum surface area for a given volume. Puddles and films can exist in of the presence of other forces, like gravity and the intermolecular attraction to the atoms of a substrate. The latter phenomenon is called wetting: binding forces between the substrate atoms and the film atoms can cause the total energy to decrease. In that case, the lowest energy configuration for the body would be one where as many film atoms as possible are as close as possible to the substrate. That would result in an infinitely thin film, infinitely widely spread out over the substrate. In reality, the effect of adherent wetting (causing surface maximization) and the effect of surface tension (causing surface minimization) would balance each other out: the stable configuration can be a droplet, a puddle, or a thin film, depending on the forces that work on the body.

== Colours ==

The iridescent colours of a soap film are caused by interfering of (internally and externally) reflected light waves, a process called thin film interference and are determined by the thickness of the film. This phenomenon is not the same as the origin of rainbow colours (caused by the refraction of internally reflected light), but rather is the same as the phenomenon causing the colours in an oil slick on a wet road.

==Drainage==

If surfactants are well chosen and the atmospheric humidity and air movements are suitably controlled, a horizontal soap film can last from minutes to hours. In contrast, a vertical soap film is affected by gravity and so the liquid tends to drain, causing the soap film to thin at the top. Colour depends on film thickness, which accounts for the coloured interference fringes that can be seen at the top of figure 4.

==Black spots==
During the late stages of draining, sharp-edged black spots start to form. These spots are significantly thinner (&lt; 100 nm) than the normal soap film, giving rise to their black interference colour. Whether black spots can form depends on the concentration of the soap, and moreover there are two types of black films:
* Common black films, around 50 nm in thickness, and
* Newton black films, around 4 nm in thickness, require a higher electrolyte concentration. In these films the outer soap surfaces have effectively snapped together and pinched out most of the inner liquid.

As drainage continues, the black spots eventually take over the entire soap film, and despite its extreme thinness, the final black film can be quite stable and can survive for many minutes.

==Bursting==

If a soap film is unstable, it ends by bursting. A hole is created somewhere in the film and opens very rapidly. Surface tension indeed leads to surface minimization and, thus, to film disappearance. The hole aperture is not instantaneous and is slowed by the liquid inertia. The balance between the forces of inertia and surface tension leads to the opening velocity:
formula_1 where formula_2 is the liquid surface tension, formula_3 is the liquid density and formula_4 is the film thickness.

<text>Todor Hristov Zhivkov ( ; 7 September 1911 – 5 August 1998) was a Bulgarian communist statesman who served as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria (PRB) from 1954 until 1989 as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party. He was the second longest-serving leader in the Eastern Bloc, the longest-serving leader within the Warsaw Pact and the longest-serving non-royal ruler in Bulgarian history.

During World War II, Zhivkov participated in Bulgaria&#x27;s resistance movement in the People&#x27;s Liberation Insurgent Army. In 1943, he was involved in organising the Chavdar partisan detachment in and around his place of birth, becoming deputy commander of the Sofia operations area in the summer of 1944. Under his rule, many fellow former combatants with Chavdar were to rise to positions of prominence in Bulgarian affairs. He is said to have coordinated partisan movements with those of pro-Soviet army units during the 9 September 1944 uprising.

He became First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) in 1954 (General Secretary from April 1981), served as Prime Minister from 1962 to 1971 and from 1971 onwards as Chairman of the State Council, concurrently with his post as First Secretary. He remained in these positions for 35 years, until 1989, thus becoming the longest-serving leader of any European Eastern Bloc nation after World War II, and one of the longest ruling non-royal leaders in modern history. His rule marked a period of unprecedented political and economic stability for Bulgaria, marked both by complete submission of Bulgaria to the Soviet Union and a desire to expand ties with the West. His rule remained unchallenged until the deterioration of East–West relations in the 1980s, when a stagnating economic situation, a worsening international image and growing careerism and corruption in the BCP weakened his position. He resigned on 10 November 1989, under pressure by senior BCP members due to his refusal to recognise problems and deal with public protests. Within a month of Zhivkov&#x27;s ousting, communist rule in Bulgaria had effectively ended, and within a year the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria had formally ceased to exist.

== Early life ==
Zhivkov was born in the Bulgarian village of Pravets into a peasant family, to Hristo Todorov Zhivkov and Maruza Gergova Zhivkova. The exact date of Zhivkov&#x27;s birth was in dispute within Zhivkov&#x27;s family, as his mother insisted that he had been born on 20 September 1911. However, Zhivkov would say in his memoirs that the Orthodox priest that was charged with keeping the records of new births at the time was found to be very drunk and forgot to write down the actual day of birth, instead writing in only the day of baptism. Expressing confidence in his knowledge of local custom, this allowed him to calculate that his actual day of birth had been 13 days earlier – on 7 September of that year. He had apparently been able to verify this as his real date of birth, though he continued to jokingly argue with his mother about the incident for years on end.

In 1928, he joined the Bulgarian Communist Youth Union (BCYU), an organisation closely linked with the Bulgarian Workers Party (BWP) – later the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP). The following year he obtained a post at the &quot;Darzhavna pechatnitsa&quot;, the official government publisher in Sofia. In 1932, he joined the BWP proper, later serving as secretary of its Second Borough Committee and as a member of its Sofia County Committee. Although the BWP was banned along with all other political parties after the coup of 19 May 1934, it continued fielding a handful of non-party National Assembly Deputies and Zhivkov retained his posts at its Sofia structure.

During World War II, Zhivkov participated in Bulgaria&#x27;s resistance movement in the People&#x27;s Liberation Insurgent Army against the country&#x27;s alignment with Nazi Germany and was sympathetic to the country&#x27;s 50,000 Jews. In 1943, he was involved in organising the Chavdar partisan detachment in and around his place of birth, becoming deputy commander of the Sofia operations area in the summer of 1944. Under his rule, many fellow former combatants with Chavdar were to rise to positions of prominence in Bulgarian affairs. He is said to have coordinated partisan movements with those of pro-Soviet army units during the 9 September 1944 uprising.

== Rise to power ==

After 9 September 1944, Zhivkov became head of the Sofia police force, restyled as the &quot;Narodna Militsiya&quot; (People&#x27;s Militia). He was elected to the BCP Central Committee as a candidate member in 1945 and a full member in 1948. In the run-up to the 1949 treason trial against Traicho Kostov, Zhivkov criticised the Party and judicial authorities for what he claimed was their leniency with regard to Kostov. This placed him in the Stalinist hardline wing of the Party. In 1950, Zhivkov became a candidate member of the BCP Politburo, then led by Valko Chervenkov, leading to a full membership in 1951. In the years which followed, he was involved in countering countryside resistance to forced farm collectivisation in north-western Bulgaria.

=== The April Plenum and Zhivkov&#x27;s ascendancy ===
After Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death, an emphasis on shared leadership emerged. When the hardline Stalinist Chervenkov gave up his post as General Secretary of the BCP in 1954, Zhivkov took his place, but Chervenkov retained most of his powers as prime minister. Bulgarian opinion at the time interpreted this as a self-preservation move by Chervenkov, since Zhivkov was a less well known figure in the party. After Nikita Khrushchev delivered his famous secret speech against Stalin at the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 20th Congress, a BCP Central Committee plenary meeting was convened in April 1956 to agree to adopt a new Krushchevite line. At that &quot;plenum&quot;, Zhivkov criticised Chervenkov as a disciple of Stalin, had him demoted from prime minister to a cabinet post, and promoted former Committee for State Security (CSS) head Anton Yugov to the post of prime minister. It was at this point that he became the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Bulgaria. Subsequently, Zhivkov was associated with the &quot;April Line&quot;, which had anti-Stalinist credentials. Chervenkov publicly accepted the criticism levied against him, admitted to allowing &quot;mistakes&quot; and &quot;excesses&quot; to take place in the country and resigned from political life.

=== The beginning of liberalisation ===
Subsequently, Zhivkov carried out a policy of relative sociopolitical liberalisation and de-Stalinization in Bulgaria, similar to the Khrushchev Thaw in the Soviet Union. Zhivkov took action against what he saw as a cults of personality – whether in relation to Stalin, Chervenkov or to other figures. Monuments considered as being part of such cults were taken down and many public places renamed – the most prominent of which were the return of &quot;Mount Stalin&quot; back to its prewar name of Mount Musala and that of the city of &quot;Stalin&quot; back to Varna. Zhivkov resented the idea of himself being the subject of a cult and later, when the residents of his hometown of Pravets erected a monument bearing his likeness – he personally thanked them for their gesture, before ordering the statue be removed. It would only be restored in 2001 – after Zhivkov had passed away.

Zhivkov discontinued many &quot;excesses&quot;, removed monopolies on art and culture and vastly restrained, though not fully abolished, the practice of penal labour. Zhivkov would also pardon and rehabilitate many of those he viewed as unfairly sentenced by the People&#x27;s Courts (which were already abolished by this point), such as renowned Bulgarian author Dimitar Talev – who subsequently had his author&#x27;s union membership restored, would publish his most famous works and would even be elected as member of parliament to Bulgaria&#x27;s National Assembly in 1966.

The April Plenum of the BCP endorsed Zhivkov&#x27;s liberalisation, which was seen by many as a sign of deeper reform. Consequently, groups began openly petitioning Zhivkov for further increases in the freedom of the press, cultural freedoms and subsequently, even some open protests formed, petitioning Zhivkov to take action against local party leaders that the protesters were unhappy with. Zhivkov reacted by sacking and punishing those local and regional leaders whose policies had led to local dissatisfaction and unrest, instead beginning a program of promoting younger and more ambitious cadres to fill their roles. The promotion of these new cadres, unaffiliated with cliques and untainted by corruption, served to create a loyal following of local leaders and administrators for Zhivkov, further increasing his control of the Communist party, whilst simultaneously increasing popular support for his government.

At the 8th Congress of the BCP in late 1962, Zhivkov accused Yugov of anti-Party activity, expelled him from the BCP and had him placed under house arrest.

=== Attempted coup ===
With the increasingly strengthening positions of Zhivkov as the country&#x27;s and Communist party&#x27;s leader, former partisan leaders and active military took a critical stance on what they viewed as the revisionist policies of Zhivkov&#x27;s leadership. In the events described as the &quot;April Conspiracy&quot; of 1965 or the &quot;Plot of Gorunia&quot;, general Ivan Todorov-Gorunya, general Tsvyatko Anev (&quot;Цвятко Анев&quot;) and Tsolo Krastev (&quot;Цоло Кръстев&quot;) organised a group of high-ranking military officers planning to overthrow the regime. Their plan was to establish a pro-Chinese leadership in the country, based on Stalinist-Maoist principles. The coup was exposed and between 28 March and 12 April 1965 and most of the plotters were arrested and expelled from the party.

== Prime Minister (1962–1971) and Chairman of the State Council (1971–1989) ==
As prime minister, Zhivkov remained faithful to the Soviet Union, but adopted a more liberal stance than his predecessor by allowing some market reforms (such as allowing surplus agricultural goods to be sold for profit) and ending persecution of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.

In the early 1970s, Zhivkov decided to update the country&#x27;s Dimitrov Constitution, which led him to the creation of the so-called Zhivkov Constitution. The latter was intended to boost the country&#x27;s image without risking any instability. The Zhivkov constitution separated party and state organs, empowering Bulgaria&#x27;s National Assembly, giving the right of legislative initiative to labour unions and youth groups, as well as creating a collective head of state in the institution of the State Council, appointed by the National Assembly. The State Council took over some of the roles previously exercised by the country&#x27;s communist party and had the ability to enact laws on behalf of the assembly when the latter was not in session. Zhivkov further wished to distance his country from the image of a one-party state, thus the Zhivkov constitution explicitly mentioned that political power in the country was to be shared &quot;cooperatively&quot; between the Communist Party and the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union, the communists&#x27; coalition partner.

The new constitution was approved by Bulgarian voters in the 1971 Bulgarian constitutional referendum. Subsequently, Zhivkov resigned from his post as prime minister and was instead made Chairman of the State Council, making him the titular head of the collective Bulgarian Presidency. In practice, though Bulgaria was now constitutionally at minimum a two-party state, the fact that the BANU was a minor coalition partner of Zhivkov&#x27;s communist party allowed him to preside over a favourable national assembly, which could then approve of the State Council&#x27;s decisions.

== Policies ==
=== Economic ===
In the mid-1950s, Soviet-style centralised planning produced economic indicators showing that Bulgarians were returning to their prewar lifestyle in some respects: real wages increased 75%, consumption of meat, fruit, and vegetables increased markedly, medical facilities and doctors became available to more of the population, and in 1957 collective farm workers benefited from the first agricultural pension and welfare system in Eastern Europe.

In 1959 the Communist Party borrowed from the Chinese Great Leap Forward to symbolise a sudden burst of economic activity to be injected into the Third Five-Year Plan (1958–1962), whose original scope was quite conservative. According to the revised plan, industrial production would double and agricultural production would triple by 1962; a new agricultural collectivisation and consolidation drive would achieve great economies of scale in that branch; investment in light industry would double, and foreign trade would expand. Following the Chinese model, all of Bulgarian society was to be propagandised and mobilised to meet the planning goals. Two purposes of the grandiose revised plan were to keep Bulgaria in step with the Soviet bloc, all of whose members were embarking on plans for accelerated growth, and to quell internal party conflicts. Amalgamation of collective farms cut their number by 70 per cent, after which average farm acreage was second only to the Soviet Union among countries in Eastern Europe. Zhivkov, whose &quot;theses&quot; had defined the goals of the plan, purged Politburo members and party rivals Boris Taskov (in 1959) and Anton Yugov (in 1962), citing their criticism of his policy as economically obstructionist. Already by 1960, however, Zhivkov had been forced to redefine the impossible goals of his theses. Lack of skilled labour and materials made completion of projects at the prescribed pace impossible. Harvests were disastrously poor in the early 1960s; peasant unrest forced the government to raise food prices; and the urban dissatisfaction that resulted from higher prices compounded a crisis that broke in the summer of 1962. Blame fell on Zhivkov&#x27;s experiments with decentralised planning, which was totally abandoned by 1963. Despite this, by 1960 the value produced by heavy industry matched that of light industry, and food processing for export grew rapidly. Throughout the second phase, budget expenditures consisted primarily of reinvestment in sectors given initial priority. The completion of collectivisation in 1958 had shifted 678,000 peasants, about 20 per cent of the active labour force, into industrial jobs.

By the early 1960s, however, changes to the system were obviously needed to achieve sustained growth in all branches of production, including agriculture. Corecom was established as a means to sell Western-made luxury goods to foreign tourists and Bulgarians that held special monetary certificates, thus acquiring western hard currency – which had been in short supply as many Western governments did not allow the exchange of their currencies for their Eastern Bloc equivalents. Specific incentives to reform were shortages of labour and energy and the growing importance of foreign trade in the &quot;thaw&quot; years of the mid-1960s. Consequently, in 1962 the Fourth Five-Year Plan began an era of economic reform that brought a series of new approaches to the old goal of intensive growth. In industry the &quot;New System of Management&quot; was introduced in 1964 and lasted until 1968. This approach intended to streamline economic units and make enterprise managers more responsible for performance. In June 1964, about fifty industrial enterprises, mostly producers of textiles and other consumer goods, were placed under the new system. Wages, bonuses, and investment funds were tied to enterprise profits, up to 70% of which could be retained. Outside investment funds were to come primarily from bank credit rather than the state budget. In 1965 state subsidies still accounted for 63% of enterprise investment funds, however, while 30% came from retained enterprise earnings and only 7% from bank credits. By 1970 budget subsidies accounted for only 27% of investment funds, while bank credits jumped to 39%, and retained enterprise earnings reached 34%. The pilot enterprises did very well, earning profits that were double the norm. By 1967 two-thirds of industrial production came from firms under the new system, which by that time had embraced areas outside consumer production.

Before the end of the 1960s, however, Bulgarian economic planning moved back toward the conventional CPE approach. Many Western analysts attributed the Bulgarian retreat from the reforms of the 1960s to tension caused by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. International events may well have played a role, but the timing of the retreat and the invasion suggest another component: dissatisfaction among the Party elite with the results and ideological implications of the reform. For example, in July 1968, one month before the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria&#x27;s unorthodox, three-tiered pricing system was eliminated. The party leadership had never accepted the concept of free and flexible pricing for some products, which was an important Bulgarian departure from centralised planning in the 1960s. Resistance to reform was further encouraged by a series of cases in which major enterprise directors used newly decentralised financial resources to line their own pockets. However, some of the recentralisation measures, such as the creation of an agricultural-industrial complex, also received domestic criticism.

After a relative stagnation in the 1970s, the New Economic Model (NEM), instituted in 1981 as the latest economic reform program, seemingly improved the supply of consumer goods and generally upgraded the economy. In an effort to remedy the chronic distribution problems of the central economy, higher economic institutions became financially accountable for damage inflicted by their decisions on subordinate levels. Complexes or associations were given explicit freedom to sign their own contracts with suppliers and customers at home and abroad. However, NEM was unable to drastically improve the quality or quantity of Bulgarian goods and produce. In 1983 Zhivkov harshly criticised all of Bulgarian industry and agriculture in a major speech, but the reforms generated by his speech did nothing to improve the situation. A large percentage of high-quality domestic goods were shipped abroad in the early 1980s to shrink Bulgaria&#x27;s hard-currency debt, and the purchase of Western technology was sacrificed for the same reason, crippling technical advancement and disillusioning consumers. The NEM proved to be a failure, and GNP growth between 1981 and 1982 was only 2.9%. By 1984 Bulgaria was suffering a serious energy shortage because its Soviet-made nuclear power plant was unreliable and droughts reduced the productivity of hydroelectric plants. Bulgaria marked significant progress in scientific research by sending two men in space and supplying 70% of all electronics in the Eastern Bloc,

In 1985 Mikhail Gorbachev visited Bulgaria and reportedly pressured Zhivkov to make the country more competitive economically. This led to a Bulgarian version of the Soviet perestroika program. After a round of failed experimental measures, in January 1989 the Party issued Decree Number 56. This decree established &quot;firms&quot; as the primary unit of economic management. In a fundamental departure from the socialist prohibition of private citizens hiring labour, as many as ten people could now be hired permanently, and an unlimited number could be hired on temporary contracts. This last round of reforms by the Zhivkov regime confused rather than improved economic performance. However, statistics on growth for 1986–88 still indicated a 5.5% annual rate, up from the 3.7% rate achieved during the previous five-year plan.

=== Social ===
Even before Zhivkov, Bulgaria made significant progress in increasing life expectancy and decreasing infant mortality rates. Consistent social policies led to an increase in life expectancy to 68.1 years for men and 74.4 years for women. In 1939 the mortality rate for children under one year had been 138.9 per 1,000; by 1986 it was 18.2 per 1,000, and in 1990 it was 14 per 1,000, the lowest rate in Eastern Europe. The proportion of long-lived people in Bulgaria was quite large; a 1988 study cited a figure of 52 centenarians per 1 million inhabitants. One of the first mass HIV-testing programs was initiated under Zhivkov, and as of October 1989, some 2.5 million people in Bulgaria, including about 66,000 foreigners, had been tested for HIV, and 81 Bulgarians were diagnosed as HIV positive. Increases in real incomes in agriculture rose by 6.7 per cent per year during the 1960s. During this same period, industrial wages increased by 4.9 per cent annually. Availability of consumer durables significantly improved in the 1970s. According to official statistics, between 1965 and 1988 the number of televisions per 100 households increased from 8 to 100; radios increased from 59 to 95; refrigerators from 5 to 96; washing machines from 23 to 96; and automobiles from 2 to 40. Available automobiles were primarily Soviet Fiats, some of which were manufactured in Bulgaria.

In the postwar era, and especially under Zhivkov, housing in Bulgaria improved significantly as more and better-quality homes were built. However, many of them were cramped – the average home in Bulgaria had three rooms and an area of . Housing remained one of the most serious shortcomings in the Bulgarian standard of living throughout Zhivkov&#x27;s rule. Residential construction targets in the Five-Year Plans were regularly underfulfilled. Consequently, families often waited several years for apartments; in Sofia, where overcrowding was at its worst, the wait was as long as ten years. A system of distribution was implemented, which gave priority to &#x27;Active Fighters against Fascism&#x27; (those that had been part of the partisan struggle or fought against Nazi Germany in World War II), as well as eminent artists, scientists and &quot;Heroes of Socialist Labour&quot; (mostly collective farmers and shop-floor workers).

The educational system, despite the addition of ideological subjects, remained relatively unchanged after the beginning of the Communist era. In 1979 Zhivkov introduced a sweeping educational reform, claiming that Marxist teachings on educating youth were still not being applied completely. Zhivkov therefore created Unified Secondary Polytechnical Schools (&quot;Edinni sredni politekhnicheski uchilishta&quot;, ESPU), in which all students would receive the same general education. The system united previously separate specialised middle schools in a single, twelve-grade program heavily emphasising technical subjects. In 1981 a national program introduced computers to most of the ESPUs.

=== Foreign ===

Although the Zhivkov regime often advocated closer relations and multilateral cooperation with Yugoslavia, Turkey, the Kingdom of Greece, Albania, and Romania, a number of traditional issues barred significant improvement until the late 1980s. Without exception Zhivkov imitated or supported Soviet twists and turns such as Khrushchev&#x27;s denunciation of Stalin in 1956 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Substantial historical and economic ties supplemented the ideological foundation of the relationship. In the 1970s and 1980s, Bulgaria improved its diplomatic relations with nations outside the Soviet sphere. The 1970s was a period of closeness between Brezhnev&#x27;s USSR and Zhivkov&#x27;s Bulgaria. Zhivkov was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union in 1977. Yet, though Bulgarian &quot;émigré&quot; dissident Georgi Markov wrote that &quot;[Zhivkov] served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet leaders themselves did&quot;, in many ways he can be said to have exploited the USSR for political purposes, with Bulgaria serving a buffer between the USSR and NATO. Thus, he claims in his memoirs that the USSR had become &quot;a raw material appendage to Bulgaria&quot;, something obliquely confirmed by Gorbachev when he wrote in his memoirs that &quot;Bulgaria was a country which had lived beyond its means for a long time.&quot; An example of how the &quot;raw material appendage&quot; was exploited was the trade in Soviet crude oil. This would be shipped to Bulgaria&#x27;s modern refinery in Burgas at subsidised prices, processed, and resold on world markets at a huge premium.

In 1963 and 1973, the Zhivkov regime made requests – it is unclear how far these were in earnest – that Bulgaria be incorporated into the USSR, both times because the Bulgarian government, having engaged in bitter polemics with Yugoslavia over the Macedonia naming dispute, feared a Soviet–Yugoslav reconciliation at its own expense. In 1963, following the decision of Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow to recognise the autonomy of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, the Bulgarian leaders openly declared that there was no &quot;historic Macedonian nation&quot;. In the face of Moscow&#x27;s post-1953 efforts to reach out to Belgrade and Athens, Zhivkov seems to have calculated that a policy of unswerving loyalty to the Kremlin would ensure that it remained more valuable for the USSR than non-aligned Yugoslavia or NATO-affiliated Greece.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bulgaria gave official military support to many national liberation causes, most notably in North Vietnam, Indonesia, Libya, Angola, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, and the Middle East. In 1984 the 9,000 Bulgarian advisers stationed in Libya for military and nonmilitary aid put that country in first place among Bulgaria&#x27;s Third World clients. Through its Kintex arms export enterprise, Bulgaria also engaged in covert military support activities, many of which were subsequently disclosed. In the 1970s, diplomatic crises with Sudan and Egypt were triggered by Bulgarian involvement in coup plots.

Under Zhivkov Bulgaria&#x27;s policy toward Western Europe and the United States was determined largely by the position of the Soviet Union. Events such as the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan automatically distanced Bulgaria from the West; then, in the early 1980s Soviet efforts to split NATO by cultivating Western Europe brought Bulgaria closer to France and West Germany – a position that continued through the 1980s. Even in the 1970s, Zhivkov actively pursued better relations with the West, overcoming conservative opposition and the tentative, tourism-based approach to the West taken as early as the 1960s. Emulating Soviet détente policy of the 1970s, Bulgaria gained Western technology, expanded cultural contacts, and attracted Western investments with the most liberal foreign investment policy in Eastern Europe. As in 1956 and 1968, however, Soviet actions altered Bulgaria&#x27;s position. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979, which Bulgaria supported vigorously, renewed tension between Bulgaria and the West. Alleged Bulgarian implication in the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II in 1981 exacerbated the problem and kept relations cool through the early 1980s. A 1988 application for membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was refused because of the Turkish assimilation program, after widespread expectations of success.

Bulgarian relations with Greece, a traditional enemy, were stable throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in spite of major government changes in both countries. Zhivkov made this stability a model for the overall Balkan cooperation that was a centerpiece of his foreign policy in the 1980s. In 1986 the two countries signed a declaration of good-neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation that was based on mutual enmity toward Turkey and toward Yugoslav demands for recognition of Macedonian minorities in Bulgaria and Greece. An important motivation for friendship with Greece was to exploit NATO&#x27;s Greek-Turkish split, which was based on the claims of the two countries in Cyprus. In early 1989, Bulgaria signed a ten-year bilateral economic agreement with Greece.

In late summer 1988, Zhivkov was visited by a Bavarian delegation on headed by Franz Josef Strauss. During the course of their visit, Zhivkov had apparently asked Strauss for ideas on how he could reform and modernise Bulgaria&#x27;s economic system. Strauss expressed pessimism in the idea, telling him that, in his opinion, the system could not be reformed, only replaced. Zhivkov then asked what Bulgaria had to do in order to potentially join the European Economic Community (EEC), which Strauss initially thought was a misinterpretation, asking Zhivkov whether he meant closer cooperation between Bulgaria and Bavaria. Zhivkov reiterated that he was asking about a potential membership of Bulgaria in the EEC, much to the Bavarian leader&#x27;s surprise. This event did not have any lasting political consequences, as Strauss died only a week after the end of his visit, before any real discussion on the topic could be made.

=== Cultural ===
Until the late 1980s, Zhivkov successfully prevented unrest in the Bulgarian intellectual community. Membership in the writers&#x27; union brought enormous privilege and social stature, and that drew many dissident writers such as Georgi Dzhagarov and Lyubomir Levchev into the circle of the officially approved intelligentsia. On the other hand, entry required intellectual compromise, and refusal to compromise led to dismissal from the union and loss of all privileges. Markov tells a story of how Zhivkov reproached a popular newspaper cartoonist for modifying his signature to resemble a pig&#x27;s tail, yet did not persecute him. A handful of satirist dissidents such as Radoy Ralin enjoyed some prominence during Zhivkov&#x27;s tenure, although Ralin was not favoured by the authorities due to his sharp satire.

Zhivkov also softened organised opposition by restoring symbols of the Bulgarian cultural past that had been cast aside in the postwar campaign to consolidate Soviet-style party control. Beginning in 1967, he appealed loudly to the people to remember &quot;our motherland Bulgaria&quot;. In the late 1970s, Zhivkov mended relations with the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Zhivkov&#x27;s extensive campaign of cultural restoration provided at least some common ground between him and the Bulgarian intelligentsia. In 1980 Zhivkov had improved his domestic position by appointing his daughter Lyudmila Zhivkova as chair of the commission on science, culture, and art. In this powerful position, Zhivkova became extremely popular by promoting Bulgaria&#x27;s separate national cultural heritage. She spent large sums of money in a highly visible campaign to support scholars, collect Bulgarian art, and sponsor cultural institutions. Among her policies was closer cultural contact with the West; her most visible project was the spectacular national celebration of Bulgaria&#x27;s 1,300th anniversary in 1981. When Zhivkova died in 1981, relations with the West had already been chilled by the Afghanistan issue, but her brief administration of Bulgaria&#x27;s official cultural life was a successful phase of her father&#x27;s appeal to Bulgarian national tradition to unite the country.

Sports also prospered during Zhivkov&#x27;s rule. From 1956 to 1988, Bulgaria won an unprecedented 153 Olympic medals and numerous European and world competitions in sports as diverse as volleyball, rhythmic gymnastics and wrestling.

== Controversy ==
Despite the thaw period he initiated, dissidents could still be punished under Zhivkov&#x27;s rule. The CSS was a feared tool of control, and overt opposition largely stayed underground until the late 1980s. Blaga Dimitrova was harshly denounced for her critical portrayal of party officials in her 1982 novel &quot;Litse&quot;.

Much like in many other Eastern European countries at the time, Bulgarians needed exit visas to travel abroad.

When Mikhail Gorbachev announced his reform program, Zhivkov made a show of copying it, believing that Gorbachev was not really serious about &quot;glasnost&quot; or &quot;perestroika.&quot; However, he showed his true colours when he expelled several members of a human-rights watch group from the Party. Soon afterward, when several intellectuals announced the formation of the &quot;Club for the Support of Perestroika and Glasnost&quot;, he arrested the leaders and threw them out of the Party.

== Character ==
Throughout his tenure, Zhivkov&#x27;s dialect and poor manners made him the butt of many acerbic jibes and jokes in Bulgaria&#x27;s urbane circles. While the feared CSS secret police was commonly said to persecute those who told political jokes, Zhivkov himself was said to have found them amusing and collected an archive of them. His popular nickname was &quot;bai Tosho&quot; (approximately &quot;Ol&#x27; Uncle Tosho&quot;) or occasionally (and later) &quot;Tato&quot; (a dialectal word for &quot;Dad&quot; or &quot;Pop&quot;).

== Fall ==

Zhivkov had long since benefitted from restoring and promoting Bulgarian national symbols, such as those on the country&#x27;s national emblem, thus creating a sort of patriotic national communism, which proved to increase Zhivkov&#x27;s popularity. This, alongside the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, done ostensibly in order to protect the interests of Turkish Cypriots in 1974, alongside a fear of the militarist, anti-communist regime brought in power in Turkey by the 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état caused both Zhivkov and the establishment to fear for a similar scenario in Bulgaria. To this end, Zhivkov attempted to counter this perceived threat by attempting to trigger a second Bulgarian National Revival through a series of policies collectively alluded to as the &quot;Revival Process&quot;. The most controversial of these was a decision taken in December 1984 of assimilation of Bulgarian Turks through the &quot;restoration&quot; of &quot;Turkish&quot; to &quot;Bulgarian&quot; names. Though official statements attempted to allude this to be a campaign of unity and the destruction of inter-ethnic barriers, it was met with wild resistance among several groups of Bulgarian Turks, who viewed it as an attack on their identity. The first demonstration against the &quot;revival process&quot; took place on 24 December, when 1200 people peacefully protested in the village of Mlechino without incident. However, the protests turned violent the day after, as the local chief of police alleged that the demonstrators had started throwing stones at both the police and local fire brigade, which led to an attempt by the authorities to disperse the protests via a water cannon. Several more incidents took place between protesting crowds and the local police during the following few days.

Organised ethnic Turkish opposition against the &quot;revival process&quot; occurred in early January the following year, as an honoured &quot;fighter against fascism and capitalism&quot;, a local mayor and a communist party secretary joined forces to petition the government to end the campaign. Militant anti-government groups formed in one village and when local government officials came to negotiate with the protesters, they were taken prisoner by the groups, which subsequently cut off all communication between the village and the outside world. The next day, another group of local officials arrived, this time accompanied by a large posse of armed policemen. They were met by the armed groups, which targeted them with molotov cocktails and improvised armaments, causing them to retreat. The armed groups then detonated bombs in order to demolish the local bridges and set up barricades along the roads. On 19 January, the village was surrounded by government tanks, APCs, fire trucks and police vehicles. The armed groups responded by first sending out their wives, which were hanging onto fake babies, while they stood behind them armed. Upon figuring out this ruse, the police arrested the group&#x27;s main negotiator and stormed the village through the use of tear gas and water cannons. After a quick fight the armed groups were beaten and one of their members was accidentally killed after falling in front of a moving tank.

The name changing campaign ended just a month after it began, but the &quot;Revival process&quot; persisted. Some of the militant groups openly resorted to terrorism, setting off several bombs – in the Varna Airport parking lot, Plovdiv&#x27;s main railway station, inside a civilian passenger train near Bunovo (the bomb was programmed to detonate whilst inside a tunnel in order to maximise casualties, but the train had run two minutes late and it detonated while it was near the railway station instead) and inside a hotel in Sliven, leading to several deaths and many injuries. The CSS would report uncovering a total of 42 illegal pro-Turkish groups and foiling several more terror plots. In total, 517 people were sent to prisons for their roles in the uprisings, riots, terrorist attacks and other &quot;revival process&quot;-related events between 1984 and 1989. In May 1989, Zhivkov declared that all persons that felt not at home in Bulgaria would be free to leave the country to go live in Turkey. Zhivkov underestimated the opposition he had generated within the ranks of the Bulgarian Turks and over 360,000 people left the country, some of which reportedly feeling as though they had few other options. The campaign was an abject failure and generally considered to be Zhivkov&#x27;s biggest mistake. The GERB-majority National Assembly passed a non-binding resolution in 2012, in which it condemned the revival process, dubbing it &quot;a form of ethnic cleansing carried out by a totalitarian regime&quot;.

As it turned out, this was the beginning of the end for the long-time leader. Bulgaria was the target of near-unanimous condemnation from the international community; even the Soviets protested. Gorbachev already did not think much of Zhivkov; he regarded Zhivkov as one of a group of inflexible hardliners that included East Germany&#x27;s Erich Honecker, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Gustáv Husák and Romania&#x27;s Nicolae Ceaușescu. However, after the Turkish episode, he was determined to see Zhivkov gone. The Turkish affair alarmed several high-ranking Bulgarian officials as well, including Prime Minister Georgi Atanasov, Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov and Finance Minister Andrey Lukanov. They began plotting to remove him, but had to move discreetly given the ubiquity of the CSS.

In October 1989, Mladenov organised a CSCE environmental summit in Sofia. He invited an independent group of Bulgarian environmental activists, Ecoglasnost, to participate. Ten days into the conference, several Ecoglasnost activists and supporters were brutally beaten up by CSS and militia officers—on orders from Zhivkov. They then corralled 36 other opposition activists, drove them to the countryside and forced them to walk back to Sofia. Amid near-unanimous international condemnation, Mladenov, Lukanov and Atanasov decided that Zhivkov had to go. In a critical step, they convinced Defence Minister Dobri Dzhurov to support them.

The plotters struck on 9 November, a day before a Politburo meeting. Dzhurov met Zhivkov in private and told him that he needed to resign, and there was enough support on the Politburo to vote him out. Zhivkov was taken by surprise and tried to marshal support, to no avail. Just before the meeting the next day, Dzhurov gave Zhivkov an ultimatumunless he stepped down, the Politburo would not only vote to remove him, but have him executed. Seeing the writing on the wall after the motion calling for his removal passed, Zhivkov resigned, officially for reasons of age and health. Mladenov was elected his successor. On 17 November the National Assembly removed him from the post of Chairman of the State Council, replacing him with Mladenov.

On 11 December, only a month after Zhivkov&#x27;s ousting, Mladenov called for the Communist Party to give up its guaranteed right to rule. The Central Committee fell into line two days later, calling for free elections in the spring and asking the National Assembly to delete the portions of the Constitution that enshrined the party&#x27;s &quot;leading role&quot;. On 15 January, the National Assembly struck out the portions of the constitution giving the Communist Party a monopoly of power. Thus, within only two months of Zhivkov losing power, the Communist system he had helped to create, and which he had dominated for 35 years, was no more.

While he was initially shown reverence in public upon removal, that had changed by 17 November, when he was sharply criticised in parliament. On 13 December, Zhivkov was expelled from the party for what Lukanov described as &quot;gross violations of laws and gross mistakes in politics&quot;. Mladenov contended that Zhivkov&#x27;s stewardship had left the country in &quot;a near heart-attack condition&quot;. The party also began an investigation into what it considered Zhivkov&#x27;s &quot;high living&quot;.

== Trial and acquittal ==
Following his fall from power, the new regime brought Zhivkov to five separate trials – labelled trials No.1 through No. 5 of the Republic of Bulgaria, each with their own indictment. Indictment No. 1 regarded the &#x27;Revival Process&#x27;, Indictment 2 accused him of overstepping his authority in &quot;funding the international communist movement&quot;, Indictment 3 accused him and 21 others of giving out high-risk loans to developing countries, Indictment 4 accused him of giving away apartments and cars worth a total of around $24 million (in 1990 dollars) to members of the security forces and indictment 5 accused him of involvement in labour camps. The first four were brought before the court immediately, while indictment 5 was brought before the court later.

Zhivkov pled not guilty to all counts on all indictments, but was initially found guilty of one of the four indictments at that point, Indictment 4, and was subsequently sentenced to seven years in prison. He disputed the court&#x27;s verdict and appealed it. An appellate court found &quot;oddities&quot; in the original verdict and decided to confirm it, but lowered his sentence to just 1 year and 6 months.

The chairman of the court stated that if Zhivkov was still unsatisfied with his verdict, he could only appeal to then-President Zhelyu Zhelev for a pardon. Zhivkov adamantly refused to ask for a pardon and stated that even if given one he would not accept it, as he opined that pardons are only given to guilty people and he did not consider himself guilty.

On 8 June 1993 he was found innocent on indictment 5.

In 1994 his sentence in Trial 4 went into effect, but was substituted by house arrest due to his ill health.

Zhivkov continued to assert his innocence and on 15 September 1995, the Supreme Court of Bulgaria agreed to hear his plea and reconsidered his verdict. Zhivkov threatened to go to the European Court of Human Rights if not found innocent, accusing Bulgarian courts of accepting political orders.

General Prosecutor Evtim Stoimenov declared that the prosecution had been &quot;under strong pressure&quot; to find Zhivkov guilty of something and that a 1971 document proved his innocence in regards to Indictment 4. He subsequently resigned from his post and was replaced by Martin Gunev.

On 9 February 1996 the Bulgarian Supreme Court recognised Zhivkov as a former head of state and ruled that the prosecution had not presented evidence for Zhivkov&#x27;s guilt, reversing the verdict on Indictment 4 and declaring him innocent on all charges.

A month after Zhivkov&#x27;s death, one of the main prosecutors, Krasimir Zhekov, resigned from his position, citing his inability to get Zhivkov convicted of anything. He left Sofia and moved to Pazardzhik, where he lived with a low state pension until his death in 2013.

&quot;The Porcupine&quot;, a fictional account of the trial of Stoyo Petkanov, a barely disguised Zhivkov, was written by Julian Barnes and published in Bulgarian and English in 1992.

== Later life and death ==

Zhivkov was subsequently released, giving frequent interviews to foreign journalists and writing his memoirs in the final years of his life.

In his memoirs, which he dubbed &quot;the longest confession of his life&quot;, he defined himself as an &quot;ordinary village boy from Pravets&quot; and told the story of his life, along with his analysis of his own government and legacy. He spoke of the socialist society in Bulgaria as being divided into two parts – &quot;the [societal]&quot; &quot;order,&quot; which he described as the basic societal organisation and ethos in country and &quot;the system&quot;, the practical structure of government, led by a Vanguard party. He spoke positively of the first, describing it as proper, justified and prosperous. He blamed the collapse of socialism, instead, on the latter. He stated that he had not changed his political views and remained a committed Marxist, but had come to realise that the system was overly bureaucratic, inflexible and ultimately failed, bringing the order down with it. He concluded that the ultimate collapse of his system was due to his own failures to reform and modernise said system in the 1970s and 80s. He opined that socialism would ultimately triumph regardless, but that this would be a new form of socialism and would be led by a new, younger generation, which he hoped would be &quot;better in every way from ours&quot; and would lead to a &quot;more prosperous, more just and more democratic Bulgaria&quot;. He criticised the ruling right-wing UDF government at the time, but reserved his harshest criticism for the former members of his party that had taken part in embezzlement of state assets following his departure.

In his final interview, conducted before the Bulgarian National Television in 1997, he surprisingly seemed to take more issue with some of his former party members, than the ruling right-wing UDF party at the time. He strongly criticised Andrey Lukanov and Petar Mladenov, the former communists turned social democrats that ruled Bulgaria in the immediate aftermath of his resignation. He blamed them for betraying their values and for leading the country into economic ruin and expressed his unwillingness to both re-join his former party and to join the communist splinter party. He maintained that he still believed in socialism, but added that he had made friends with many people across many parties, including the UDF. He defended most of his actions while in power and explained his reasoning behind several of his policies, but reiterated his belief that &quot;&quot;the order&quot; was good, but &quot;the system&quot; which ruled it was bad&quot;.

In early 1998, a shifting power balance within the Bulgarian Socialist Party led to Zhivkov re-joining it, leading to a round of ovation by party members during a rally.

Zhivkov died from complications of bronchial pneumonia as a free man on 5 August 1998, at the age of 86. With his death, all attempts of the prosecution to reintroduce the dismissed cases were dropped.

The UDF-led government refused petitions from Zhivkov&#x27;s family and the Socialist Party to have him buried in a state funeral due to his status as a former head of state. He was buried after a large privately run procession, organised by the local Socialist Party branch.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
=== Image and approval ratings ===
Years and even decades after his death, his legacy is continued in Bulgarian pop culture, with songs, shirts and various souvenirs featuring him or his likeness being easy to find in modern-day Bulgaria. A billboard posthumously celebrating his 100th birthday was erected in Nesebar in 2011, while portraits, posters and calendars bearing his image are still commonly found in the country, with several mayors and other officials being reported as placing them up or handing them out regularly. Obituaries were placed around the town of Smolyan 21 years after his death in 2019, comparing him to a star and Bulgarian national hero Hristo Botev.

In 2001, the communist-period monument of Zhivkov was re-erected in his hometown of Pravets in the presence of the leaders of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, alongside Zhivkov&#x27;s 1990–1998 bodyguard, Boyko Borisov, future Bulgarian Prime Minister, who then was the Chief Secretary of the Bulgarian Ministry of Interior. His former home in the town was then turned into a museum in his honour in 2002. Subsequently, the annual celebrations of the anniversary of Zhivkov&#x27;s birthday on 7 September, gradually developed into a state-wide affair. Beginning in 2012, the celebrations have been incongruously accompanied by the flag of Europe. A second monument of Zhivkov was erected in the village of Odurne in 2013 by the local mayor, who had promised its sculpting as part of his electoral program.

In modern times, Zhivkov is regarded as popular and his government widely viewed with nostalgia from many sectors of Bulgarian society. Sociologic surveys have found that the average approval of Todor Zhivkov in the 2010s ranged from 41% to 55%, while disapproval ranged from 18% to 25%. A study published by &quot;RC Trend&quot; pegged Zhivkov as one of the top 5 most approved of Bulgarian politicians of all time, alongside former prime ministers Petko Karavelov, Stefan Stambolov and Aleksandar Stamboliyski, while another by Gallup International Association found that 74% of Bulgarians believe the country to have been &quot;ruined&quot; by the politicians that took power after his resignation, most prominently blaming UDF leader Ivan Kostov (49% of respondents). Half of all respondents which gave an answer in the RC Trend study also expressed a desire to go back in time, so that they would live during &#x27;Zhivkov&#x27;s time&#x27;, rather than continue living in the modern day republic.

In 2019, the history textbooks of five major academic publishers in Bulgaria had described Zhivkov as a &#x27;moderate ruler, whose policies were aimed at improving the welfare of the ordinary people&#x27; – drawing condemnation from a faculty member at the American University in Bulgaria and an investigative journalist. The growing academic nostalgia for Zhivkov&#x27;s rule was not appreciated by Bulgaria&#x27;s ruling center-right GERB party and in particular the education minister Krasimir Valchev – who ordered the textbooks changed to condemn what he dubbed &quot;bloody communism&quot;. Valchev&#x27;s order was opposed by the Bulgarian Socialist Party, which accused him of historical revisionism, political interference in education and an undemocratic enforcement of a particular worldview.

===Political and social===
Zhivkov ultimately survived the Sino-Soviet split, Khrushchev&#x27;s fall in October 1964, an attempted Stalinist-Maoist &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in 1965, his daughter Lyudmila Zhivkova&#x27;s death in 1981, Brezhnev&#x27;s death in 1982, and Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s post-1985 reforms.

However, shortly after falling from power, Zhivkov was expelled from the communist party and subsequently arrested by his former comrades. The Soviet Bloc in the face of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (SEV, Comecon), the Warsaw Pact Organization and the USSR itself collapsed. The communist party rebranded itself as the Bulgarian Socialist Party and won the 1990 Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election, defeating both the right-wing opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, a party representing ethnic Turks. Analyst Gerald Creed opined that this marked a significant victory for supporters of socialism in Bulgaria, noting that Bulgaria had become the first Eastern European country to re-elect an openly socialist party in a free election following the collapse of socialism in the bloc. The Socialist-led government, however, failed at addressing the problems facing the country and providing a cohesive vision for the future. It suffered a split as the left-wing of the party broke off in order to form the New Bulgarian Communist Party, while the right-wing opposition remained united and aggressively opposed the government, hampering any attempts at finding an exit to the political crisis that had gripped the country. The Socialists&#x27; government, which had by then rejected Marxism–Leninism in favour of social democracy under its new leader Andrey Lukanov, subsequently collapsed under its inability to deal with the crisis, narrowly losing the opposition in the 1991 Bulgarian parliamentary election.

Zhivkov&#x27;s attempts to integrate and assimilate Bulgarian Turks ultimately did not yield their intended results, instead leading to the creation of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, a party largely based on ethnic Turkish affiliation. Despite the fact that Bulgaria&#x27;s post-1991 constitution retained the restrictions against the formation of racial, ethnic or religious-based parties, the MRF was ruled a legal party by Bulgaria&#x27;s supreme court in 1992.

The country&#x27;s political ideology and foreign policies of Zhivkov&#x27;s era have thus been reversed.

===Economic===
On the other hand, after very significant reverses and difficulties in the 1940s and 1950s, the Bulgarian economy developed apace from the mid-1960s until the late 1970s. Most of today&#x27;s large industrial facilities such as the Kremikovtsi steelworks and the Chervena Mogila engineering works were built under Zhivkov. Bulgaria&#x27;s nuclear power station, AEC Kozloduy, was built in the 1970s, all six large reactors commissioned in under five years. This, and Bulgaria&#x27;s many coal-fired and hydroelectric power stations, made the country a major electric power exporter. By the 1970s, the focus switched to high technologies such as electronics and even space exploration: on 10 April 1979 Bulgaria launched the first of two &quot;kosmonavti&quot; (cosmonauts), Georgi Ivanov, aboard Soviet &quot;Soyuz&quot; spaceships and later launched its own space satellites. Having been among the first nations to market electronic calculators (the ELKA brand, since 1973) and digital watches (Elektronika, since 1975), in 1982 the country launched its Pravets personal computer (a near-&quot;Apple II clone&quot;) for business and domestic use. In the mid-1960s an economic reform package was introduced, which allowed for farmers to freely sell their over-planned production. Shortly after that Bulgaria became the first and only Eastern Bloc country which locally produced Coca-Cola. Mass tourism developed under Zhivkov&#x27;s direction from the early 1960s onwards.

However, this Bulgarian economy was exceptionally susceptible to Soviet largesse and Soviet-bloc markets. After the Soviet crude oil price shock of 1979, it entered a very severe recession from which it hardly recovered in the 1980s. After the early-1990s loss of Soviet and Comecon markets, this economy (unused to competing in a free market environment) entered prolonged and significant contraction. Zhivkov-era industrial facilities were largely unattractive to investors, many being left to decay. Great numbers of specialist personnel retired and died without being replaced, or else emigrated or left their state jobs for more lucrative private employment. As agriculture declined, tourism has emerged as almost the sole Zhivkov-era industrial survivor. However, it is widely thought that incompetent and corrupt administration after 1989 had a much greater effect on the decline of the economy, as even successful industries declined. Following the end of Zhivkov&#x27;s rule state properties were widely embezzled and stripped of assets, the revenues of which were funnelled through tax havens, creating a new class of nouveau riche oligarchs at the cost of the destruction of Bulgaria&#x27;s industry. This was done both by ex-functionaries from Zhivkov&#x27;s former party turned &#x27;businessmen&#x27;, as well as by members of the right-wing opposition, the Union of Democratic Forces, which came into power a year later.

== Family and personal life ==
Zhivkov married Mara Maleeva (1911–1971) in 1938. They had two children, a daughter named Lyudmila Zhivkova and a son called Vladimir Zhivkov. Maleeva was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1969, leading to a two year long and ultimately futile fight with the disease. Maleeva reportedly did not wish to undergo surgery, but Zhivkov insistently convinced her to go. The operation was successful, but the cancer was already late-stage. In August 1971, her condition worsened sharply. She was described as undergoing unbearable pain and became bedridden. In his memoirs, Zhivkov mentioned that the last time he had seen her, he noticed that she had played a recording of one of his speeches on repeat, so that she could keep listening to his voice. She died of the disease on 23 October 1971. Her death deeply affected Zhivkov and he was described as becoming unpredictable and lacking self control in the few weeks after her death.

Lyudmila would become a very notable, albeit controversial, cultural icon – promoting unorthodox and divergent artistic ideas, as well as practising Eastern religions and mysticism to the ire of both the supporters of state atheism and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Her mother sharply opposed the idea of Lyudmilla having any part in Bulgaria&#x27;s politics and even went as far as to &#x27;forbid&#x27; her husband Zhivkov from considering her or any other family members for political posts of any kind. Zhivkov respected his wife&#x27;s wishes during her life, but reconsidered his position following her death and was later convinced to appoint Lyudmilla, who was popular among artists and the intelligentsia, as the vice-chairperson on the consultative committee for friendship and cultural diplomacy. In this position, she actively promoted cultural liberalisation with the aid of several of Bulgaria&#x27;s top intellectuals, while at the same time her avant-garde tastes were left unappreciated by the general masses. She juggled Bulgarian National Revival themes with postmodernism, puzzling many observers. Zhivkov nevertheless allowed her to advise him on cultural matters and agreed on an idea she had presented alongside several artists, for the creation of a grand monument in commemoration of the 1300th Anniversary of the Bulgarian State. She had proposed the granting to an avant-garde sculptor, Valentin Starchev, full creative freedom in designing the monument. The result was a controversial monument that was both incredibly unique, and commonly understood as very ugly. Todor Zhivkov himself was said to have altered his daily commute in order to avoid having to look at it, though he never scolded the sculptor for it. Lyudmilla lived in poor health, ostensibly due to her unusual lifestyle, failed relationships and stress, dying abruptly at the age of 38 in 1981.

Zhivkov&#x27;s son-in-law Ivan Slavkov became the chairman of Bulgaria&#x27;s state television company and later became president of the Bulgarian Olympic Committee, a position he would continue to hold until 2005.

Zhivkov reserved a special attention for his birthplace of Pravets. In the 1960s this small village was declared &quot;an Urban Community&quot;, becoming a town a decade later. In 1982 Bulgaria&#x27;s first Apple clone personal computer was named the &quot;Pravets&quot;. The citizens of Pravets responded by erecting a heroic statue to Zhivkov which he duly had taken down, ostensibly to prevent a personality cult growing around him. It was re-erected after his death.

<text>Soyuz 29 (, &quot;Union 29&quot;) was a 1978 crewed Soviet space mission to the Salyut 6 space station. It was the fifth mission, the fourth successful docking, and the second long-duration crew for the orbiting station. Commander Vladimir Kovalyonok and flight engineer Aleksandr Ivanchenkov established a new space-endurance record of 139 days.

The crew returned in Soyuz 31, which had been swapped by a crew launched in August who returned in Soyuz 29.

==Crew==

===Backup crew===
==Mission highlights==
===Launch and station re-activation===
The second long-duration mission to Salyut 6 was launched into orbit on 15 June 1978. The space station had been vacant for three months since the record-breaking mission of Soyuz 26 ended after 96 days. The crew successfully docked on 17 June and Kovalyonok and Ivanchenkov reactivated the station. Kovalyonok, who was aboard the failed Soyuz 25 mission to Salyut 6, became the first person to visit the same station twice.

They switched on the station&#x27;s air regenerators and thermal regulation system, and activated the water recycling system to reprocess water left aboard by Soyuz 26. De-mothballing Salyut 6 occurred simultaneously with the crew&#x27;s adaptation to weightlessness, and required about one week. On 19 June, Salyut 6 was in a orbit. Onboard temperature was , and air pressure was . Soon after this, Kovalyonok and Ivanchenkov performed maintenance on the station&#x27;s airlock, installed equipment they brought with them in Soyuz 29&#x27;s orbital module, and tested the station&#x27;s Kaskad orientation system.

The station operated in gravity-gradient stabilized mode between 24 and 26 June to avoid attitude control system engine firings which could cause interference with a 3-day smelting experiment using the Splav-01 furnace. The previous crew installed the furnace in the intermediate compartment so it could operate in vacuum. At the time, the station was in an orbit exposed to sunlight for an entire day. This happened twice a year when the plane of the station&#x27;s orbit faced the sun.

===Soyuz 30 crew visits, Progress 2 docks===
Soyuz 30, with Pyotr Klimuk and the second Intercosmos participant, Mirosław Hermaszewski of Poland, arrived at Salyut 6 on 29 June. For the third time, the Salyut was a four-man orbiting space laboratory. The activities of the Soyuz 30 crew, however, were severely curtailed so as not to interfere with the Soyuz 29 crew. They returned to Earth in the capsule they came in on 5 July.

Progress 2, the second uncrewed supply tanker to dock with a crewed space station, arrived at Salyut 6 on 9 July. Fifty days of supplies were on board, including 200 litres of water, of food, the Kristall furnace, of propellant, air re-generators, computer sub-systems, replacement parts, film and mail. It took the crew a week to unload the vehicle. On 19 July, the tanker refueled the station, then it was filled with used equipment and trash and sent into a destructive de-orbit on 4 August.

The crew was advised not to use the station treadmill at certain speeds, as dangerous vibrations could be produced. This advice was a result of resonance experiments carried out by the previous long-term Soyuz 26 crew.

Experiments continued, with glass and semi-conductor tests done with the Kristall furnace, newly installed in the transfer tunnel leading to the rear docking port. Mercury telluride and cadmium telluride were processed on 18 July, and 24 July saw aluminum, tin and molybdenum alloys processed in the Spalv furnace.

The crew complained of headaches before realizing the carbon dioxide detectors had failed to alert them to change the air purifiers. Normal levels were 8.8 mm Hg; the levels had likely reached 62 mm Hg to cause the headaches.

===Spacewalk, Progress 3===
The crew performed a spacewalk on 29 July, the second from Salyut 6. Their main mission was to retrieve material from the Medusa experiment, left on the station&#x27;s exterior by the Soyuz 26 crew in December. The experiment was designed to test various materials&#x27; exposure to space. Aluminum, titanium, steel, rubber and glass were among the materials tested. Later examination revealed two hundred small craters caused by orbital debris, much more than anticipated. Much of the debris was said to be paint chips and propellant residue.

During the two-hour EVA, the crew saw a meteor pass below them, an event which briefly blinded them. Air lost during the EVA was replaced by air from the Progress 2 spacecraft.

Progress 3 was launched on 8 August and docked with Salyut 6 two days later. With it, the station&#x27;s orbit was boosted to 244 x . Supplies aboard the tanker included strawberries, onions, milk, of air, 190 litres of water, fur boots, newspapers, film, letters and equipment. Additionally, Ivanchenkov&#x27;s guitar was on board. It was the first tanker not to carry a fresh supply of propellant for the station, as Progress 2 had so recently replenished Salyut 6&#x27;s tanks. The Progress was de-orbited on 23 August.

The station was put into gravity gradient stabilized flight on 11 August for materials processing with the Kristall and Splav furnaces, and the crew underwent medical experiments on 16 August.

===Soyuz 31 crew visits, first Soyuz redock===
Soyuz 29&#x27;s second visiting crew was launched on 26 August on Soyuz 31 with Valery Bykovsky and East German Sigmund Jähn, the third Intercosmos participant, aboard. Food was brought aboard, and numerous medical and biological experiments were carried out. The visiting crew swapped craft with the resident crew, and tested Soyuz 29&#x27;s engines on 2 September. Seat liners were exchanged the next day, the craft undocked, and Bykovsky and Jähn returned to Earth.

On 7 September, after the Soyuz 31 crew had left, the Soyuz 29 crew entered the Soyuz 31 craft and undocked from the Salyut 6 station. Salyut 6 was commanded to rotate 180 degrees, and Soyuz 31 redocked at its forward port. It was the first time the Soviets had attempted such a redocking. The redock had the effect of clearing the aft port for another Progress craft.

Experiments continued on the station, and on 15 September, the cosmonauts took their second showers. By October, some 3,000 photographs had been taken and some 50 experiments carried out.

The crew marked a significant milestone on 20 September when they surpassed the 96-day space endurance record of the Soyuz 26 crew, set earlier that year.

===Progress 4, propulsion system troubles, and return to Earth===
The third Progress tanker for the crew arrived at Salyut 6&#x27;s aft port on 6 October. Progress 4 had of equipment aboard, including air canisters, clothes, magazines and food. Ivanchenkov&#x27;s wife had smuggled some brandy-filled chocolates into a box of candy, and when the crew opened the box, the chocolates flew out. It took them two hours to retrieve the candies.

Refueling was completed on 13 October, two burns were used to raise the station&#x27;s orbit on 20 October, and the Progress was de-orbited on 26 October.

Towards the end of the mission, the cosmonauts noticed abnormal behavior with the station&#x27;s engines and reported it to ground controllers.

More experiments were carried out in the waning days of the mission. A lunar eclipse was observed on 7 October, extensive medical tests were carried out between 17 and 18 October, and more material experiments were conducted in the Kristall and Splav furnaces on 22 October.

The crew exercised three hours a day during their final month in orbit. Experiments were transferred to Soyuz 31 on 30 October, its engines were tested, and the station&#x27;s interior was cleaned. They returned to Earth on 2 November, landing southeast of Jezkazgan. The landing was covered live by Soviet television. The crew mostly recovered in five days, and fully recovered 25 days after their return. They were the first crew to have difficulty talking after returning to Earth. Despite all this, their condition was slightly better than the previous long-duration crew&#x27;s. They had spent a total of 139 days in orbit.

After the residency was finished and Salyut 6 went back into uncrewed mothball mode for the next several months, ground crews studied telemetry data from the station to figure out what was wrong with the propulsion system. They concluded that a leak in one of the UDMH tanks had contaminated the nitrogen-pressurized bellows that fed propellant into the engines. Further use of the main engines could aggravate the leak and possibly ruin the entire propulsion system, including the attitude control thrusters. As a result of this development, it was decided to not risk firing the main engines again for the remainder of the station&#x27;s operating life. With Salyut 6 limited to its attitude control thrusters, all orbital maneuvers from now on had to be carried out by visiting spacecraft.

The relatively good shape the crew were in was seen as a direct result of the hard exercise program carried out in the final days of the mission, and cleared the way for even longer flights.

<text>New York City Hall is the seat of New York City government, located at the center of City Hall Park in the Civic Center area of Lower Manhattan, between Broadway, Park Row, and Chambers Street. Constructed from 1803 to 1812, the building is the oldest city hall in the United States that still houses its original governmental functions. The building houses the office of the Mayor of New York City and the chambers of the New York City Council. While the Mayor&#x27;s Office is in the building, the staff of thirteen municipal agencies under mayoral control are located in the nearby Manhattan Municipal Building, one of the largest government buildings in the world, with many others housed in various buildings in the immediate vicinity.

New York City Hall is a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated both City Hall&#x27;s exterior and interior as official city landmarks in 1966 and 1976, respectively.

==History==
===17th century===
New Amsterdam&#x27;s first City Hall was built by the Dutch Republic in the 17th century near present-day 73 Pearl Street. The first structure was demolished in 1690.

===18th century===
The city&#x27;s second City Hall, built in 1700, stood on Wall and Nassau Streets. That building was renamed Federal Hall in 1789, after New York became the first official capital of the United States after the Constitution was ratified. It was demolished in 1812 and current Federal Hall was built in 1842.

Plans for building a new City Hall were discussed by the New York City Council as early as 1776, but the financial strains of the war delayed progress. The Council chose a site at the old Common at the northern limits of the city, now City Hall Park. City Hall was originally an area for the first almshouse in 1653. In 1736, there was a financed almshouse for those who were fit to work, for the unfit, and those that were like criminals but were paupers.

===19th century===
In 1802, New York City held a competition for a new City Hall. The first prize of $350 was awarded to Joseph-François Mangin and John McComb Jr. Mangin studied architecture in his native France before becoming a New York City surveyor in 1795 and publishing an official map of the city in 1803 that was largely discredited for its inaccuracies. Mangin later served as the architect of the landmarked St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral on Mulberry Street. McComb, whose father had worked on the old City Hall, was a New Yorker and designed Castle Clinton in Battery Park, among other buildings and structures. Mangin had no known involvement with City Hall after winning the commission. McComb alone supervised every aspect of construction and was in charge of the architectural modifications and detailing during the extended building process.

The cornerstone of the new City Hall was laid on May 26, 1803. Construction was delayed after the City Council objected that the design was too extravagant. In response, McComb reduced the size of the building and used brownstone at the rear of the building to lower costs. The brownstone, along with the original deteriorated Massachusetts marble facade, quarried from Alford, Massachusetts, was later replaced with Alabama limestone between 1954 and 1956. Labor disputes and an outbreak of yellow fever further slowed construction. The building was not dedicated until 1811, and opened officially in 1812.

The New York City Police riot occurred in front of New York City Hall between the recently dissolved New York Municipal Police and the newly formed Metropolitan Police on June 16, 1857. Municipal police fought with Metropolitan officers who were attempting to arrest New York City Mayor Fernando Wood.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In 1953, the city&#x27;s public works commissioner Frederick H. Zurmuhlen requested $2.2 million to repair City Hall&#x27;s facade, which was crumbling.

On July 23, 2003, at 2:08 p.m., City Hall was the scene of a rare political assassination. Othniel Askew, a political rival of City Councilman James E. Davis, opened fire with a pistol from the balcony of the City Council chamber. Askew shot Davis twice, fatally wounding him. A police officer on the floor of the chamber then fatally shot Askew. Askew and Davis had entered the building together without passing through a metal detector, a courtesy extended to elected officials and their guests. As a result of the security breach, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg revised security policy to require that everyone entering the building pass through metal detectors without exception.

In 2008, work began on a restoration of the building, after a century without a major renovation. The construction included structural enhancements, upgrades to building services, as well as in-depth restoration of much of the interior and exterior. Due to the complexity of the demands of the project, the New York City Department of Design and Construction hired Hill International to provide construction management. Renovations were originally estimated to cost $104 million and take four years, but ended up costing nearly $150 million and taking over five years.
==Architecture==
Although Mangin and McComb designed the building, which was constructed between 1810 and 1812, it has been altered numerous times over the years by several architects. These include Leopold Eidlitz in 1860, John H. Duncan in 1898, William Martin Aiken in 1903, Grosvenor Atterbury from 1907 to 1917, Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon in 1956, and Cabrera Barricklo in 1998.

The architectural style of City Hall combines international architectural influences, French Renaissance and English neoclassicism. American-Georgian is more evident in the interior design. The design of City Hall influenced at least two later civic structures, the Tweed Courthouse and the Surrogate&#x27;s Courthouse immediately to the north. City Hall is a New York City designated landmark. It is also listed on the New York State and National Registers of Historic Places.

=== Exterior ===
The building consists of a central pavilion with two projecting wings. The entrance, reached by a long flight of steps, has figured prominently in civic events for over a century and a half. There is a columned entrance portico capped by a balustrade, and another balustrade at the roof. The domed tower in the center was rebuilt in 1917 after the last of two major fires. The original Massachusetts marble facade, quarried from Alford, Massachusetts, and complemented with brownstone on the rear elevation, had deteriorated over time from pollution and pigeons. It was completely reclad in Alabama limestone above a Missouri granite base in 1954–56 by Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon, architects of the Empire State Building.

The steps of City Hall frequently provide a backdrop for political demonstrations and press conferences concerning city politics. Live, unedited coverage of events at City Hall is carried on NYC Media channel 74, a City Government-access television (GATV) official cable TV channel.

Fencing surrounds the building&#x27;s perimeter, with a strong security presence by the New York City Police Department and other security. Public access to the building is restricted to tours and to those with specific business appointments.

=== Interior ===

On the inside, the rotunda is a soaring space with a grand marble stairway rising up to the second floor, where ten fluted Corinthian columns support the coffered dome, which was added in a 1912 restoration by Grosvenor Atterbury. The rotunda has been the site of municipal as well as national events. Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s coffin was placed on the staircase landing across the rotunda when he lay in state in 1865 after his assassination. Ulysses S. Grant also lay in state beneath the soaring rotunda dome – as did Colonel Elmer Ephraim Ellsworth, first Union officer killed in the Civil War and commander of the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment (First Fire Zouaves).

There are 108 paintings from the late 18th century through the 20th century, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared were &quot;almost unrivaled as an ensemble, with several masterpieces&quot;. Among the collection is John Trumbull&#x27;s 1805 portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the source of the face on the United States ten-dollar bill. There were significant efforts to restore the paintings in the 1920s and 1940s. In 2006, a new restoration campaign began for 47 paintings identified by the Art Commission as highest in priority.

Official receptions are held in the Governor&#x27;s Room, which has hosted many dignitaries including the Marquis de Lafayette and Albert Einstein. The building&#x27;s Governor&#x27;s Room hosted President-elect Abraham Lincoln in 1861. The Governor&#x27;s Room, which is used for official receptions, also houses one of the most important collections of 19th-century American portraiture and notable artifacts such as George Washington&#x27;s desk.

Other notable rooms include:
* The Outer Room is adjacent to the traditional Mayor&#x27;s office, which is a small space on the northwest corner of the first floor
* The Ceremonial Room is where the mayor would meet officials and hold small group meetings
* The Blue Room is where New York City mayors have been giving official press conferences for decades and is often used for bill-signing ceremonies
* Room 9 is the press room at City Hall where reporters file stories in cramped quarters
==Surroundings==

===Neighborhood===
The area around City Hall is commonly referred to as the Civic Center. Most of the neighborhood consists of government offices (city, state, and federal), as well as an increasing number of upscale residential dwellings being converted from older commercial structures. Architectural landmarks surround City Hall, including St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel, St. Peter&#x27;s Church, the Home Life Building, the Rogers Peet Building, and the Woolworth Building to the west; the Broadway–Chambers Building to the northwest; 280 Broadway, 49 Chambers, Tweed Courthouse, and Surrogate&#x27;s Courthouse to the north; the Manhattan Municipal Building to the northeast; the Brooklyn Bridge to the east; and the New York Times Building, the Potter Building, and the Park Row Building to the southwest. City Hall Park is approximately three blocks away from the World Trade Center to the west. Pace University&#x27;s New York City campus is located across Park Row from City Hall.

===Subway stations===
Located directly under City Hall Park is the former City Hall subway station, the original southern terminal of the first service of the New York City Subway built by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). Opened on October 27, 1904, this station beneath the public area in front of City Hall was designed to be the showpiece of the new subway. The platform and mezzanine feature Guastavino tile, skylights, colored glass tile work and brass chandeliers. Passenger service was discontinued on December 31, 1945, although the station is still used as a turning loop for trains.

Another station named City Hall () also exists on the BMT Broadway Line, albeit on the western side of City Hall and not directly under it. This station was built in 1918 for the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT).

Other nearby, open subway stations are Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall/Chambers Street () and Chambers Street–World Trade Center/Park Place/Cortlandt Street ().

==As a geographic center==
Google Maps uses New York City Hall as the zero-mile point from which distances from New York City are measured.

<text>The S1C reactor was a prototype naval reactor designed for the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships. The S1C designation stands for:

* S = Submarine platform
* 1 = First generation core designed by the contractor
* C = Combustion Engineering (C-E) was the contracted designer

== History ==
This nuclear reactor was built in Windsor, Connecticut as a prototype for the experimental USS &quot;Tullibee&quot; (SSN-597) submarine, though that boat was in fact powered by a S2C reactor. Unusual for a nuclear submarine propulsion plant, steam turbines powered generators, which in turn powered an electric motor. This eliminated the need for reduction gears and their associated underwater noise. The USS &quot;Tullibee&quot; was an early advanced-design, fast-attack submarine constructed by Electric Boat and commissioned in 1960.

Throughout the Cold War, the S1C Prototype nuclear submarine propulsion plant at the Windsor Site (41°52&#x27;44&quot;N 72°43&#x27;03&quot;W) supported the submarines and surface ships of the Navy’s nuclear fleet by testing new equipment and training Naval propulsion plant operators. S1C was the prototype for the USS &quot;Tullibee&quot;. The S1C Prototype was operated at the Windsor Site from 1959 until 1993. During that time, over 14,000 Naval operators were trained there, including Admiral Kirkland H. Donald early in his career.

The Windsor site was located at 1000 Prospect Hill Rd. (the address was later changed to 2000 Day Hill Road) on a 530-acre tract purchased by Combustion Engineering in 1955.

Full remediation of the S1C site was declared to be complete by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection in 2006. Remediation of the site was undertaken by Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL), based out of Schenectady, New York. KAPL had taken over operation of the S1C site in the 1970s after expiration of the Navy&#x27;s original contract with C-E.

The reactor was situated on land and known as the S1C Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU). Regarding its size and electric drive, the system layout was different than the S5W reactor used in most nuclear-powered submarines at the time. The prototype and ship had four turbine generators (2 for DC power for propulsion and 2 for AC voltage) and banked rod control. There was only two levels in the engineering spaces and the electrical operator operated out in the engineering spaces unlike S5W or later submarines.

<text>Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman (; 7 November 188821 November 1970), known simply as C. V. Raman, was an Indian physicist known for his work in the field of light scattering. Using a spectrograph that he developed, he and his student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, the deflected light changes its wavelength. This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light, which they called &quot;modified scattering&quot; was subsequently termed the &quot;Raman effect&quot; or &quot;Raman scattering&quot;. In 1930, Raman received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery and was the first Asian and the first non-White to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.

Born to Tamil Brahmin parents, Raman was a precocious child, completing his secondary and higher secondary education from St Aloysius&#x27; Anglo-Indian High School at the age of 11 and 13, respectively. He topped the bachelor&#x27;s degree examination of the University of Madras with honours in physics from Presidency College at age 16. His first research paper, on diffraction of light, was published in 1906 while he was still a graduate student. The next year he obtained a master&#x27;s degree. He joined the Indian Finance Service in Calcutta as Assistant Accountant General at age 19. There he became acquainted with the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), the first research institute in India, which allowed him to carry out independent research and where he made his major contributions in acoustics and optics.

In 1917, he was appointed the first Palit Professor of Physics by Ashutosh Mukherjee at the Rajabazar Science College under the University of Calcutta. On his first trip to Europe, seeing the Mediterranean Sea motivated him to identify the prevailing explanation for the blue colour of the sea at the time, namely the reflected Rayleigh-scattered light from the sky, as being incorrect. He founded the &quot;Indian Journal of Physics&quot; in 1926. He moved to Bangalore in 1933 to become the first Indian director of the Indian Institute of Science. He founded the Indian Academy of Sciences the same year. He established the Raman Research Institute in 1948 where he worked to his last days.

The Raman effect was discovered on 28 February 1928. The day is celebrated annually by the Government of India as the National Science Day.

== Early life and education ==

C. V. Raman was born in Tiruchirappalli in the Madras Presidency of British India (now Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, India) to Tamil Iyer Brahmin parents, Chandrasekhar Ramanathan Iyer and Parvathi Ammal. He was the second of eight siblings. His father was a teacher at a local high school, and earned a modest income. He recalled: &quot;I was born with a copper spoon in my mouth. At my birth my father was earning the magnificent salary of ten rupees per month!&quot; In 1892, his family moved to Visakhapatnam (then Vizagapatam or Vizag) in Andhra Pradesh as his father was appointed to the faculty of physics at Mrs A.V. Narasimha Rao College.

Raman was educated at the St Aloysius&#x27; Anglo-Indian High School, Visakhapatnam. He passed matriculation at age 11 and the First Examination in Arts examination (equivalent to today&#x27;s intermediate examination, pre-university course) with a scholarship at age 13, securing first position in both under the Andhra Pradesh school board (now Andhra Pradesh Board of Secondary Education) examination.

In 1902, Raman joined Presidency College in Madras (now Chennai) where his father had been transferred to teach mathematics and physics. In 1904, he obtained a B.A. degree from the University of Madras, where he stood first and won the gold medals in physics and English. At age 18, while still a graduate student, he published his first scientific paper on &quot;Unsymmetrical diffraction bands due to a rectangular aperture&quot; in the British journal &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot; in 1906. He earned an M.A. degree from the same university with highest distinction in 1907. His second paper published in the same journal that year was on surface tension of liquids. It was alongside Lord Rayleigh&#x27;s paper on the sensitivity of ear to sound, and from which Lord Rayleigh started to communicate with Raman, courteously addressing him as Professor.

Aware of Raman&#x27;s capacity, his physics teacher Rhishard Llewellyn Jones insisted he continue research in England. Jones arranged for Raman&#x27;s physical inspection with Colonel (Sir Gerald) Giffard. Raman often had poor health and was considered as a &quot;weakling.&quot; The inspection revealed that he would not withstand the harsh weathers of England, the incident of which he later recalled, and said, &quot;[Giffard] examined me and certified that I was going to die of tuberculosis... if I were to go to England.&quot;

==Career==

Raman&#x27;s elder brother Chandrasekhara Subrahmanya Ayyar had joined the prestigious Indian government service, Indian Finance Service (now Indian Audit and Accounts Service). Raman followed suit and qualified for the Indian Finance Service achieving first position in the entrance examination in February 1907. He was posted in Calcutta (now Kolkata) as Assistant Accountant General in June 1907. 

He was highly impressed by the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), Calcutta, the first research institute founded in India in 1876. He immediately befriended Asutosh Dey (who would eventually become his lifelong collaborator), Amrita Lal Sircar (the founder Mahendralal Sircar&#x27;s son and secretary of IACS), and Ashutosh Mukherjee (executive member of the IACS and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta). With their support, he obtained permission to conduct research at IACS in his own time even &quot;at very unusual hours,&quot; as Raman later reminisced. Up to that time the institute had not yet recruited regular researchers, or produced any research paper. Raman&#x27;s article &quot;Newton&#x27;s rings in polarised light&quot; published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1907 became the first from the institute. The work inspired IACS to publish a journal, &quot;Bulletin of Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science,&quot; in 1909 in which Raman was the major contributor.

In 1909, Raman was transferred to Rangoon, British Burma (now Myanmar), to take up the position of currency officer. After only a few months, he had to return to Madras as his father died from an illness. The subsequent death of his father and funeral rituals compelled him to remain there for the rest of the year. Soon after he resumed office at Rangoon, he was transferred back to India at Nagpur, Maharashtra, in 1910. Even before he served a year in Nagpur, he was promoted to Accountant General in 1911 and again posted to Calcutta.

From 1915, the University of Calcutta started assigning research scholars under Raman at IACS. Sudhangsu Kumar Banerji (who later become Director General of Observatories of India Meteorological Department), a PhD scholar under Ganesh Prasad, was his first student. From the next year, other universities followed suit including University of Allahabad, Rangoon University, Queen&#x27;s College Indore, Institute of Science, Nagpur, Krisnath College, and University of Madras. By 1919, Raman had guided more than a dozen students. Following Sircar&#x27;s death in 1919, Raman received two honorary positions at IACS, Honorary Professor and Honorary Secretary. He referred to this period as the &quot;golden era&quot; of his life.

Raman was chosen by the University of Calcutta to become the Palit Professor of Physics, a position established after the benefactor Sir Taraknath Palit, in 1913. The university senate made the appointment on 30 January 1914, as recorded in the meeting minutes:Prior to 1914, Ashutosh Mukherjee had invited Jagadish Chandra Bose to take up the position, but Bose declined. As a second choice, Raman became the first Palit Professor of Physics but was delayed for taking up the position as World War I broke out. It was only in 1917 when he joined Rajabazar Science College, a campus created by the University of Calcutta in 1914, that he became a full-fledged professor. He reluctantly resigned as a civil servant after a decade of service, which was described as &quot;supreme sacrifice&quot; since his salary as a professor would be roughly half of his salary at the time. But to his advantage, the terms and conditions as a professor were explicitly indicated in the report of his joining the university, which stated:Raman&#x27;s appointment as the Palit Professor was strongly objected to by some members of the Senate of the University of Calcutta, especially foreign members, as he had no PhD and had never studied abroad. As a kind of rebuttal, Asutosh Mukherjee arranged for an honorary DSc which the University of Calcutta conferred Raman in 1921. The same year he visited Oxford to deliver a lecture at the Congress of Universities of the British Empire. He had earned quite a reputation by then, and his hosts were Nobel laureates J. J. Thomson and Lord Rutherford. Upon his election as Fellow of the Royal Society in 1924, Mukherjee asked him of his future plans, which he replied, saying, &quot;The Nobel Prize of course.&quot; In 1926, he established the &quot;Indian Journal of Physics&quot; and acted as the first editor. The second volume of the journal published his famous article &quot;A new radiation&quot;, reporting the discovery of the Raman effect.

Raman was succeeded by Debendra Mohan Bose as the Palit Professor in 1932. Following his appointment as Director of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore, he left Calcutta in 1933. Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, the King of Mysore, Jamsetji Tata and Nawab Sir Mir Osman Ali Khan, the Nizam of Hyderabad, had contributed the lands and funds for the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. The Viceroy of India, Lord Minto approved the establishment in 1909, and the British government appointed its first director, Morris Travers. Raman became the fourth director and the first Indian director. During his tenure at IISc, he recruited G. N. Ramachandran, who later went on to become a distinguished X-ray crystallographer. He founded the Indian Academy of Sciences in 1934 and started publishing the academy&#x27;s journal &quot;Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences&quot; (later split up into &quot;Proceedings - Mathematical Sciences, Journal of Chemical Sciences,&quot; and &quot;Journal of Earth System Science&quot;). Around that time the Calcutta Physical Society was established, the concept of which he had initiated early in 1917.

With his former student Panchapakesa Krishnamurti, Raman started a company called Travancore Chemical and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. in 1943. The company, renamed as TCM Limited in 1996, was one of the first organic and inorganic chemical manufacturers in India. In 1947, Raman was appointed the first National Professor by the new government of independent India.

Raman retired from IISC in 1948 and established the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore a year later. He served as its director and remained active there until his death in 1970.

== Scientific contributions ==

=== Musical sound ===

One of Raman&#x27;s interests was on the scientific basis of musical sounds. He was inspired by Hermann von Helmholtz&#x27;s &quot;The Sensations of Tone&quot;, the book he came across when he joined IACS. He published his findings prolifically between 1916 and 1921. He worked out the theory of transverse vibration of bowed string instruments based on superposition of velocities. One of his earliest studies was on the wolf tone in violins and cellos. He studied the acoustics of various violin and related instruments, including Indian stringed instruments, and water splashes. He even performed what he called &quot;Experiments with mechanically-played violins.&quot;

Raman also studied the uniqueness of Indian drums. His analyses of the harmonic nature of the sounds of tabla and mridangam were the first scientific studies on Indian percussions. He wrote a critical research on vibrations of the pianoforte string that was known as Kaufmann&#x27;s theory. During his brief visit of England in 1921, he managed to study how sound travels in the Whispring Gallery of the dome of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London that produces unusual sound effects. His work on acoustics was an important prelude, both experimentally and conceptually, to his later works on optics and quantum mechanics.

=== Blue color of the sea ===

Raman, in his broadening venture on optics, started to investigate scattering of light starting in 1919. His first phenomenal discovery of the physics of light was the blue color of seawater. During a voyage home from England on board the &quot;S.S. Narkunda&quot; in September 1921, he contemplated the blue color of the Mediterranean Sea. Using simple optical equipment, a pocket-sized spectroscope and a Nicol prism in hand, he studied the sea water. Of several hypotheses on the colour of the sea propounded at the time, the best explanation had been that of Lord Rayleigh&#x27;s in 1910, according to which, &quot;The much admired dark blue of the deep sea has nothing to do with the color of water, but is simply the blue of the sky seen by reflection&quot;. Rayleigh had correctly described the nature of the blue sky by a phenomenon now known as Rayleigh scattering, the scattering of light and refraction by particles in the atmosphere. His explanation of the blue colour of water was instinctively accepted as correct. Raman could view the water using a Nicol prism to avoid the influence of sunlight reflected by the surface. He described how the sea appears even more blue than usual, contradicting Rayleigh.

As soon as the &quot;S.S. Narkunda&quot; docked in Bombay Harbour (now Mumbai Harbour), Raman finished an article &quot;The colour of the sea&quot; that was published in the November 1921 issue of &quot;Nature&quot;. He noted that Rayleigh&#x27;s explanation is &quot;questionable by a simple mode of observation&quot; (using Nicol prism). As he thought:
When he reached Calcutta, he asked his student K. R. Ramanathan, who was from the University of Rangoon, to conduct further research at IACS. By early 1922, Raman came to a conclusion, as he reported in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society of London&quot;:True to his words, Ramanathan published an elaborate experimental finding in 1923. His subsequent study of the Bay of Bengal in 1924 provided the full evidence. It is now known that the intrinsic color of water is mainly attributed to the selective absorption of longer wavelengths of light in the red and orange regions of the spectrum, owing to overtones of the infrared absorbing O-H (oxygen and hydrogen combined) stretching modes of water molecules.

=== Raman effect ===

==== Background ====

Raman&#x27;s second important discovery on the scattering of light was a new type of radiation, an eponymous phenomenon called the Raman effect. After discovering the nature of light scattering that caused blue colour of water, he focused on the principle behind the phenomenon. His experiments in 1923 showed the possibility of other light rays formed in addition to the incident ray when sunlight was filtered through a violet glass in certain liquids and solids. Ramanathan believed that this was a case of a &quot;trace of fluorescence.&quot; In 1925, K. S. Krishnan, a new Research Associate, noted the theoretical background for the existence of an additional scattering line beside the usual polarised elastic scattering when light scatters through liquid. He referred to the phenomenon as &quot;feeble fluorescence.&quot; But the theoretical attempts to justify the phenomenon were quite futile for the next two years.

The major impetus was the discovery of Compton effect. Arthur Compton at Washington University in St. Louis had found evidence in 1923 that electromagnetic waves can also be described as particles. By 1927, the phenomenon was widely accepted by scientists, including Raman. As the news of Compton&#x27;s Nobel Prize in Physics was announced in December 1927, Raman ecstatically told Krishnan, saying:

But the origin of the inspiration went further. As Compton later recollected &quot;that it was probably the Toronto debate that led him to discover the Raman effect two years later.&quot; The Toronto debate was about the discussion on the existence of light quantum at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting held at Toronto in 1924. There Compton presented his experimental findings, which William Duane of Harvard University argued with his own with evidence that light was a wave. Raman took Duane&#x27;s side and said, &quot;Compton, you&#x27;re a very good debater, but the truth isn&#x27;t in you.&quot;

==== The scattering experiments ====

Krishnan started the experiment in the beginning of January 1928. On 7 January, he discovered that no matter what kind of pure liquid he used, it always produced polarised fluorescence within the visible spectrum of light. As Raman saw the result, he was astonished why he never observed such phenomenon all those years. That night he and Krishnan named the new phenomenon as &quot;modified scattering&quot; with reference to the Compton effect as an unmodified scattering. On 16 February, they sent a manuscript to &quot;Nature&quot; titled &quot;A new type of secondary radiation&quot;, which was published on 31 March.

On 28 February 1928, they obtained spectra of the modified scattering separate from the incident light. Due to difficulty in measuring the wavelengths of light, they had been relying on visual observation of the colour produced from sunlight through prism. Raman had invented a type of spectrograph for detecting and measuring electromagnetic waves. Referring to the invention, Raman later remarked, &quot;When I got my Nobel Prize, I had spent hardly 200 rupees on my equipment,&quot; although it was obvious that his total expenditure for the entire experiment was much more than that. From that moment they could employ the instrument using monochromatic light from a mercury arc lamp which penetrated transparent material and was allowed to fall on a spectrograph to record its spectrum. The lines of scattering could now be measured and photographed.

==== Announcement ====

The same day, Raman made the announcement before the press. The &quot;Associated Press of India&quot; reported it the next day, on 29 February, as &quot;New theory of radiation: Prof. Raman&#x27;s Discovery.&quot; It ran the story as:The news was reproduced by &quot;The Statesman&quot; on 1 March under the headline &quot;Scattering of Light by Atoms – New Phenomenon – Calcutta Professor&#x27;s Discovery.&quot; Raman submitted a three-paragraph report of the discovery on 8 March to &quot;Nature&quot; and was published on 21 April. The actual data was sent to the same journal on 22 March and was published on 5 May. Raman presented the formal and detailed description as &quot;A new radiation&quot; at the meeting of the South Indian Science Association in Bangalore on 16 March. His lecture was published in the &quot;Indian Journal of Physics&quot; on 31 March. A thousand copies of the paper reprint were sent to scientists in different countries on that day.

==== Reception and outcome ====

Some physicists, particularly French and German physicists were initially sceptical of the authenticity of the discovery. Georg Joos at the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena asked Arnold Sommerfeld at the University of Munich, &quot;Do you think that Raman&#x27;s work on the optical Compton effect in liquids is reliable?... The sharpness of the scattered lines in liquids seems doubtful to me&quot;. Sommerfeld then tried to reproduce the experiment, but failed. On 20 June 1928, Peter Pringsheim at the University of Berlin was able to reproduce Raman&#x27;s results successfully. He was the first to coin the terms &quot;Ramaneffekt&quot; and &quot;Linien des Ramaneffekts&quot; in his articles published the following months. Use of the English versions, &quot;Raman effect&quot; and &quot;Raman lines&quot; immediately followed.

In addition to being a new phenomenon itself, the Raman effect was one of the earliest proofs of the quantum nature of light. Robert W. Wood at the Johns Hopkins University was the first American to confirm the Raman effect in early 1929. He made a series of experimental verification, after which he commented, saying, &quot;It appears to me that this very beautiful discovery which resulted from Raman&#x27;s long and patient study of the phenomenon of light scattering is one of the most convincing proofs of the quantum theory&quot;. The field of Raman spectroscopy came to be based on this phenomenon, and Ernest Rutherford, President of the Royal Society, referred to it in his presentation of the Hughes Medal to Raman in 1930 as &quot;among the best three or four discoveries in experimental physics in the last decade&quot;.

Raman was confident that he would win the Nobel Prize in Physics as well but was disappointed when the Nobel Prize went to Owen Richardson in 1928 and to Louis de Broglie in 1929. He was so confident of winning the prize in 1930 that he booked tickets in July, even though the awards were to be announced in November. He would scan each day&#x27;s newspaper for announcement of the prize, tossing it away if it did not carry the news. He did eventually win that year.

===Later work===

Raman had association with the Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi. He attended the foundation ceremony of BHU and delivered lectures on mathematics and &quot;Some new paths in physics&quot; during the lecture series organised at the university from 5 to 8 February 1916. He also held the position of permanent visiting professor.

With Suri Bhagavantam, he determined the spin of photons in 1932, which further confirmed the quantum nature of light. With another student, Nagendra Nath, he provided the correct theoretical explanation for the acousto-optic effect (light scattering by sound waves) in a series of articles resulting in the celebrated Raman–Nath theory. Modulators, and switching systems based on this effect have enabled optical communication components based on laser systems.

Other investigations he carried out included experimental and theoretical studies on the diffraction of light by acoustic waves of ultrasonic and hypersonic frequencies, and those on the effects produced by X-rays on infrared vibrations in crystals exposed to ordinary light which were published between 1935 and 1942.

In 1948, through studying the spectroscopic behaviour of crystals, he approached the fundamental problems of crystal dynamics in a new manner. He dealt with the structure and properties of diamond from 1944 to 1968, the structure and optical behaviour of numerous iridescent substances including labradorite, pearly feldspar, agate, quartz, opal, and pearl in the early 1950s. Among his other interests were the optics of colloids, and electrical and magnetic anisotropy. His last interests in the 1960s were on biological properties such as the colours of flowers and the physiology of human vision.

==Personal life==

Raman married Lokasundari Ammal, daughter of S. Krishnaswami Iyer who was the Superintendent of Sea Customs at Madras, in 1907. The wedding day is popularly recorded as on 6 May, but Raman&#x27;s great-niece and biographer, Uma Parameswaran, revealed a factual date of 2 June 1907. It was a self-arranged marriage and his wife was 13 years old. (Sources are contradicting on her age as her birth year is specified as 1892, which would make her about 15 years of age; but Parameswaran affirmed the 13-year, corroborated by her obituary in &quot;Current Science&quot; that mentioned her age as 86 on her death on 22 May 1980.) His wife later jokingly recounted that their marriage was not so much about her musical prowess (she was playing &quot;veena&quot; when they first met) as &quot;the extra allowance which the Finance Department gave to its married officers.&quot; The extra allowance refers to an additional INR 150 for married officers at the time. Soon after they moved to Calcutta in 1907, the couple were accused of converting to Christianity. It was because they frequently visited St. John&#x27;s Church, Kolkata as Lokasundari was fascinated with the church music and Raman with the acoustics.

They had two sons, Chandrasekhar Raman and Venkatraman Radhakrishnan, a radio astronomer. Raman&#x27;s elder brother Chandrasekhara Subrahmanya Ayyar&#x27;s son Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar won the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Throughout his life, Raman developed an extensive personal collection of stones, minerals, and materials with interesting light-scattering properties, which he obtained from his world travels and as gifts. He often carried a small, handheld spectroscope to study specimens. These, along with his spectrograph, are on display at IISc.

Lord Rutherford was instrumental in some of Raman&#x27;s most pivotal moments in life. He nominated Raman for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930, presented him the Hughes Medal as President of the Royal Society in 1930, and recommended him for the position of Director at IISc in 1932.

Raman had a sense of obsession with the Nobel Prize. In a speech at the University of Calcutta, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m not flattered by the honour [Fellowship to the Royal Society in 1924] done to me. This is a small achievement. If there is anything that I aspire for, it is the Nobel Prize. You will find that I get that in five years.&quot; He knew that if he were to receive the Nobel Prize, he could not wait for the announcement of the Nobel Committee normally made towards the end of the year considering the time required to reach Sweden by sea route. With confidence, he booked two tickets, one for his wife, for a steamship to Stockholm in July 1930. Soon after he received the Nobel Prize, he was asked in an interview the possible consequences if he had discovered the Raman effect earlier, which he replied, &quot;Then I should have shared the Nobel Prize with Compton and I should not have liked that; I would rather receive the whole of it.&quot;

=== Religious views ===

Although Raman hardly talked about religion, he was openly an agnostic, but objected to being labelled atheist. His agnosticism was largely influenced by that of his father who adhered to the philosophies of Herbert Spencer, Charles Bradlaugh, and Robert G. Ingersoll. He resented Hindu traditional rituals but did not give them up in family circles. He was also influenced by the philosophy of &quot;Advaita Vedanta&quot;. Traditional &quot;pagri&quot; (Indian turban) with a tuft underneath and a &quot;upanayana&quot; (Hindu sacred thread) were his signature attire. Though it was not customary to wear turbans in South Indian culture, he explained his habit as, &quot;Oh, if I did not wear one, my head will swell. You all praise me so much and I need a turban to contain my ego.&quot; He even attributed his turban for the recognition he received on his first visit to England, particular from J. J. Thomson and Lord Rutherford. In a public speech, he once said,In a friendly meeting with Mahatma Gandhi and Gilbert Rahm, a German zoologist, the conversation turned to religion. Raman spoke,On his deathbed, he said to his wife, &quot;I believe only in the Spirit of Man,&quot; and asked for his funeral, &quot;Just a clean and simple cremation for me, no mumbo-jumbo please.&quot;

== Death ==

At the end of October 1970, Raman had a cardiac arrest and collapsed in his laboratory. He was moved to the hospital where doctors diagnosed his condition and declared that he would not survive for another four hours. He however survived a few days and requested to stay in the gardens of his institute surrounded by his followers and fans.

Two days before Raman died, he told one of his former students, &quot;Do not allow the journals of the Academy to die, for they are the sensitive indicators of the quality of science being done in the country and whether science is taking root in it or not.&quot; That evening, Raman met with the Board of Management of his institute in his bedroom and discussed with them the fate of the institute&#x27;s management. He also willed his wife to perform a simple cremation without any rituals upon his death. He died from natural causes early the next morning on 21 November 1970 at the age of 82.

With the news of Raman&#x27;s death, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi publicly announced, saying,

== Controversies ==

===The Nobel Prize===

==== Independent discovery ====

In 1928, Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam at the Moscow State University independently discovered the Raman effect. They published their findings in July issue of &quot;Naturwissenschaften,&quot; and presented their findings at the Sixth Congress of the Russian Association of Physicists held at Saratov between 5 and 16 August. In 1930, they were nominated for the Nobel Prize alongside Raman. According to the Nobel Committee, however: (1) the Russians did not come to an independent interpretation of their discovery as they cited Raman&#x27;s article; (2) they observed the effect only in crystals, whereas Raman and Krishnan observed it in solids, liquids and gases, and therefore proved the universal nature of the effect; (3) the problems concerning the intensity of Raman and infrared lines in the spectra had been explained during the previous year; (4) the Raman method had been applied with great success in different fields of molecular physics; and (5) the Raman effect had effectively helped to check the symmetry properties of molecules, and thus the problems concerning nuclear spin in atomic physics.

The Nobel Committee proposed only Raman&#x27;s name to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for the Nobel Prize. Evidence later appeared that the Russians had discovered the phenomenon earlier, a week before Raman and Krishnan&#x27;s discovery. According to Mandelstam&#x27;s letter (to Orest Khvolson), the Russian had observed the spectral line on 21 February 1928.

==== Role of Krishnan ====

Krishnan was not nominated for the Nobel Prize even though he was the main researcher in discovering the Raman effect. He alone first noted the new scattering. Krishnan co-authored all the scientific papers on the discovery in 1928 except two. He alone wrote all the follow-up studies. Krishnan himself never claimed himself worthy of the prize. But Raman admitted later that Krishnan was the co-discoverer. He however remained openly antagonistic towards Krishnan, which the latter described as &quot;the greatest tragedy of my life.&quot; After Krishnan&#x27;s death, Raman said to a correspondent from &quot;The Times of India&quot;, &quot;Krishnan was the greatest charlatan I have known, and all his life he masqueraded in the cloak of another man&#x27;s discovery.&quot;

=== The Raman–Born controversy ===

From October 1933 to March 1934, Max Born was employed by IISc as Reader in Theoretical Physics following the invitation by Raman early in 1933. Born at the time was a refugee from Nazi Germany and temporarily employed at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Since the beginning of the 20th century Born had developed a theory on lattice dynamics based on thermal properties. He presented his theory in one of his lectures at IISc. By then Raman had developed a different theory and claimed that Born&#x27;s theory contradicted the experimental data. Their debate lasted for decades.

In this dispute, Born received support from most physicists, as his view was proven to be a better explanation. Raman&#x27;s theory was generally regarded as having partial relevance. Beyond the intellectual debate, their rivalry extended to personal and social levels. Born later said that Raman probably thought of him as an &quot;enemy.&quot; Despite the mounting evidence for Born&#x27;s theory, Raman refused to concede. As the editor of &quot;Current Science&quot; he rejected articles that supported Born&#x27;s theory. Born was nominated several times for the Nobel Prize specifically for his contributions to lattice theory, and eventually won it for his statistical works on quantum mechanics in 1954. The account was written as a &quot;belated Nobel Prize.&quot;

=== Indian authorities ===

Raman had an aversion to the then Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru and Nehru&#x27;s policies on science. In one instance he smashed the bust of Nehru on the floor. In another, he shattered his Bharat Ratna medallion to pieces with a hammer, as it was given to him by the Nehru government. He publicly ridiculed Nehru when the latter visited the Raman Research Institute in 1948. There they displayed a piece of gold and copper against an ultraviolet light. Nehru was tricked into believing that copper which glowed more brilliantly than any other metal was gold. Raman was quick to remark, &quot;Mr Prime Minister, everything that glitters is not gold.&quot;

On the same occasion Nehru, offered Raman financial assistance to his institute which Raman flatly refused by replying, &quot;I certainly don&#x27;t want this to become another government laboratory.&quot; Raman was particularly against the control of research programmes by the government such as in the establishment of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). He remained hostile to people associated with these establishments including Homi J. Bhabha, S.S. Bhatnagar, and his once favourite student, Krishnan. He even called such programmes as the &quot;Nehru–Bhatnagar effect.&quot; In 1959, Raman proposed to establish another research institute in Madras. The Government of Madras advised him to apply for funds from the central government. But Raman clearly foresaw as he replied to C. Subramaniam, then the Minister for Finance Education in Madras, that his proposal to Nehru&#x27;s government &quot;would be met with a refusal.&quot; So ended the plan.

Raman described AICC authorities as &quot;a big &quot;tamasha&quot;&quot; (drama or spectacle) that just kept on discussing issues without action. As to problems of food resources in India, his advice to the government was, &quot;We must stop breeding like pigs and the matter will solve itself.&quot;

==== Indian Academy of Sciences ====

The Indian Academy of Sciences was born out of conflicts during the procedures of the proposal for a national scientific organization in line with the Royal Society. In 1933, the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA), at the time the largest scientific organization, planned to establish a national science body, which would be authorized to advise the government on scientific matters. Sir Richard Gregory, then editor of &quot;Nature,&quot; on his visit to India had suggested Raman, as editor of &quot;Current Science&quot;, to establish an Indian Academy of Sciences. Raman thought that it should be an exclusively Indian membership as opposed to the general consensus that British members should be included. He resolved &quot;How can India Science prosper under the tutelage of an academy which has its own council of 30, 15 of who are Britishers of whom only two or three are fit enough to be its Fellows.&quot; On 1 April 1933, he convened a separate meeting of the South Indian scientists. He and Subba Rao officially resigned from ISCA.

Raman registered the new organization as the Indian Academy of Sciences on 24 April to the Registrar of Societies. It was a provisional name to be changed to the Royal Society of India after approval from the Royal Charter. The Government of India did not recognize it as an official national scientific body, as such the ICSA created a separate organization named the National Institute of Sciences of India on 7 January 1935 (but again changed to the Indian National Science Academy in 1970). INSA had been led by the foremost rivals of Raman including Meghnad Saha, Bhabha, Bhatnagar, and Krishnan.

==== Indian Institute of Science ====

Raman had a great fallout with the authorities at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). He was accused of biased development in physics while ignoring other fields. He lacked diplomatic personality with other colleagues, which S. Ramaseshan, his nephew and later Director of IISc, reminisced, saying, &quot;Raman went in there like a bull in a china shop.&quot; He wanted research in physics at the level of those of western institutes, but at the expense of other fields of science. Max Born observed, &quot;Raman found a sleepy place where very little work was being done by a number of extremely well–paid people.&quot; At the Council meeting, Kenneth Aston, professor in the Electrical Technology Department, harshly criticized Raman and Raman&#x27;s recruitment of Born. Raman had every intention of giving the full position of professor to Born. Aston even made a personal attack on Born by referring to him as someone &quot;who was rejected by his own country, a renegade and therefore a second-rate scientist unfit to be part of the faculty, much less to be the head of the department of physics.&quot;

The Council of IISc constituted a review committee to oversee Raman&#x27;s conduct in January 1936. The committee, chaired by James Irvine, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of St Andrews, reported in March that Raman had misused the funds and entirely shifted the &quot;centre of gravity&quot; towards research in physics, and also that the proposal of Born as Professor of Mathematical Physics (which was already approved by the Council in November 1935) was not financially feasible. The Council offered Raman two choices, either to resign from the institute with effect from 1 April or resign as the Director and continue as Professor of physics; if he did not make the choice, he was to be fired. Raman was inclined to take up the second choice.

=== The Royal Society ===

Raman never seemed to have thought highly of the Fellowship of the Royal Society. He tendered his resignation as a Fellow on 9 March 1968, which the Council of the Royal Society accepted on 4 April. However, the exact reason was not documented. One reason could be Raman&#x27;s objection to the designation &quot;British subjects&quot; as one of the categories of the Fellows. Particularly after the Independence of India, the Royal Society had its own disputes on this matter.

According to Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, &quot;The London Times&quot; had once made a list of the Fellows, in which Raman was omitted. Raman wrote to and demanded an explanation from Patrick Blackett, the then President of the society. He was dejected by Blackett&#x27;s response that the society had no role in the newspaper. According to Krishnan, another cause was a disapproving review Raman received on a manuscript he had submitted to the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot;. It could have been these cumulative factors as Raman wrote in his resignation letter, and said, &quot;I have taken this decision after careful consideration of all the circumstances of the case. I would request that my resignation be accepted and my name removed from the list of the Fellows of the Society.&quot;

== Honours and awards ==
Raman was honored with many honorary doctorates and memberships of scientific societies. Within India, apart from being the founder and President of the Indian Academy of Sciences (FASc), he was a Fellow of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (FASB), and from 1943, a Foundation Fellow of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (FIAS). In 1935, he was appointed a Foundation Fellow of the National Institute of Sciences of India (FNI, now the Indian National Science Academy. He was a member of the Deutsche Akademie of Munich, the Swiss Physical Society of Zürich, the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow, the Royal Irish Academy, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, the Optical Society of America (Honorary Member), the Mineralogical Society of America, the Romanian Academy of Sciences, the Catgut Acoustical Society of America and the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.

In 1924, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. However, he resigned from the fellowship in 1968 for unrecorded reasons, the only Indian FRS ever to do so.

He was the President of the 16th session of the Indian Science Congress in 1929. He was the founder and President of the Indian Academy of Sciences from 1933 until his death. He was member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1961.

<text>Deus ex machina ( , ; plural: &quot;dei ex machina&quot;; &#x27;God from the machine&#x27;) is a plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem in a story is suddenly or abruptly resolved by an unexpected and unlikely occurrence. Its function is generally to resolve an otherwise irresolvable plot situation, to surprise the audience, to bring the tale to a happy ending or act as a comedic device.

==Origin of the expression==
&quot;Deus ex machina&quot; is a Latin calque . The term was coined from the conventions of ancient Greek theater, where actors who were playing gods were brought on stage using a machine. The machine could be either a crane (&quot;mechane&quot;) used to lower actors from above or a riser that brought them up through a trapdoor. Aeschylus introduced the idea and it was used often to resolve the conflict and conclude the drama. The device is associated mostly with Greek tragedy, although it also appeared in comedies.

===Ancient examples===
Aeschylus used the device in his &quot;Eumenides&quot; but it became an established stage machine with Euripides. More than half of Euripides&#x27; extant tragedies employ a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; in their resolution and some critics claim that Euripides invented it, not Aeschylus. A frequently cited example is Euripides&#x27; &quot;Medea&quot; in which the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; is a dragon-drawn chariot sent by the sun god Helios, used to convey his granddaughter Medea away from her husband Jason to the safety of Athens. In &quot;Alcestis&quot;, the heroine agrees to give up her own life to spare the life of her husband Admetus. At the end, Heracles appears and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and to Admetus.

Aristophanes&#x27; play &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot; parodies Euripides&#x27; frequent use of the crane by making Euripides himself a character in the play and bringing him on stage by way of the &quot;mechane&quot;.

The device produced an immediate emotional response in Greek audiences. They would have a feeling of wonder and astonishment at the appearance of the gods, which would often add to the moral effect of the drama.

===Modern theatrical examples===

Shakespeare uses the device in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;, and &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. John Gay uses it in &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; where a character breaks the action and rewrites the ending as a reprieve from hanging for MacHeath. During the politically turbulent 17th and 18th centuries, the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; was sometimes used to make a controversial thesis more palatable to the powers of the day. For example, in the final scene of Molière&#x27;s &quot;Tartuffe&quot;, the heroes are saved from a terrible fate by an agent of the compassionate, all-seeing King Louis XIV – the same king who held Molière&#x27;s career and livelihood in his hands.

==Plot device==
Aristotle (in the Poetics 15 1454b1) was the first to use a Greek term equivalent to the Latin phrase &quot;deus ex machina&quot; to describe the technique as a device to resolve the plot of tragedies. It is said by one person to be undesirable in writing and often implies a lack of creativity on the part of the author. The reasons for this are that it damages the story&#x27;s internal logic and is often so unlikely that it challenges the reader&#x27;s suspension of disbelief.

===Examples===
* &quot;&quot; writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely admitted the time travel plot device in the 2019 film was the result of having written themselves into a corner in . Also, the sudden arrival of Captain Marvel in the climax of the film has been criticized as bordering on a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; because &quot;her late arrival to the final battle ... feels like a function of her powers being too strong&quot;.
* The Great Eagles in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; carrying Frodo and Samwise out of Mordor have been critiqued as a &quot;deus ex machina&quot;.
* &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;: A passing navy officer rescues the stranded children. William Golding called that a &quot;gimmick&quot;; other critics view it as a &quot;deus ex machina&quot;. The abrupt ending conveys the terrible fate that would have afflicted the children if the officer had not arrived at that moment.
* &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;: Charles Dickens used the device when Rose Maylie turns out to be the long-lost sister of Agnes, and therefore Oliver&#x27;s aunt; she marries her long-time sweetheart Harry, allowing Oliver to live happily with his savior Mr. Brownlow.
* &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;: The Martians in H. G. Wells&#x27;s novel have destroyed everything in their path and apparently triumphed over humanity, but they are suddenly killed by bacteria.
* The Apple: A group of hippies about to be arrested by Satan for refusing to wear the mark of the beast are saved as God, who we have never seen before in the film, descends from the sky in a golden Rolls Royce to save the protagonists from going to jail for breaking a record contract and refusing to wear the mark of the beast.

==In medicine==
In medicine, the phrase is often used for supposedly &quot;magical remedies&quot; which are not likely to work in practice. For instance, in the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, when double lung transplantation for terminal COVID-19 patients was suggested, it was immediately denounced as a &quot;deus ex machina.&quot; In 2006, when electronic fetal heart monitoring was being touted as a preventive measure for cerebral palsy, &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; denounced it as &quot;deus ex machina&quot;.

==Criticism==
The &quot;deus ex machina&quot; device is often criticized as inartistic, too convenient, and overly simplistic. However, champions of the device say that it opens up ideological and artistic possibilities.

===Ancient criticism===
Antiphanes was one of the device&#x27;s earliest critics. He believed that the use of the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; was a sign that the playwright was unable to properly manage the complications of his plot.
Another critical reference to the device can be found in Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Cratylus&quot;, 425d, though it is made in the context of an argument unrelated to drama.

Aristotle criticized the device in his &quot;Poetics&quot;, where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play:
Aristotle praised Euripides, however, for generally ending his plays with bad fortune, which he viewed as correct in tragedy, and somewhat excused the intervention of a deity by suggesting that &quot;astonishment&quot; should be sought in tragic drama:
Such a device was referred to by Horace in his &quot;Ars Poetica&quot; (lines 191–2), where he instructs poets that they should never resort to a &quot;god from the machine&quot; to resolve their plots &quot;unless a difficulty worthy of a god&#x27;s unraveling should happen&quot; [&quot;nec deus intersit, nisi dignus uindice nodus inciderit; nec quarta loqui persona laboret&quot;].

===Modern criticism===
Following Aristotle, Renaissance critics continued to view the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; as an inept plot device, although it continued to be employed by Renaissance dramatists.

Toward the end of the 19th century, Friedrich Nietzsche criticized Euripides for making tragedy an optimistic genre by use of the device, and was highly skeptical of the &quot;Greek cheerfulness,&quot; prompting what he viewed as the plays&#x27; &quot;blissful delight in life.&quot; The &quot;deus ex machina&quot; as Nietzsche saw it was symptomatic of Socratic culture, which valued knowledge over Dionysiac music and ultimately caused the death of tragedy:

Nietzsche argued that the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; creates a false sense of consolation that ought not to be sought in phenomena. His denigration of the plot device has prevailed in critical opinion.
In &quot;Euripides the Rationalist&quot; (1895), Arthur Woollgar Verrall surveyed and recorded other late 19th-century responses to the device. He recorded that some of the critical responses to the term referred to it as &#x27;burlesque&#x27;, &#x27;coup de théâtre&#x27;, and &#x27;catastrophe&#x27;. Verrall notes that critics have a dismissive response to authors who deploy the device in their writings. He comes to the conclusion that critics feel that the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; is evidence of the author&#x27;s attempt to ruin the whole of his work and to prevent anyone from putting any importance on his work.

However, other scholars have looked at Euripides&#x27; use of &quot;deus ex machina&quot; and described its use as an integral part of the plot, designed for a specific purpose. Often, Euripides&#x27; plays would begin with gods, so it is argued that it would be natural for the gods to finish the action. The conflict throughout Euripides&#x27; plays would be caused by the meddling of the gods, so it would make sense both to the playwright and to the audience of the time that the gods would resolve all conflict that they began. Half of Euripides&#x27; eighteen extant plays end with the use of &quot;deus ex machina&quot;, therefore it was not simply a device to relieve the playwright of the embarrassment of a confusing plot-ending. This device enabled him to bring about a natural and more dignified dramatic and tragic ending.

Other champions of the device believe that it can be a spectacular agent of subversion. It can be used to undercut generic conventions and challenge cultural assumptions and the privileged role of tragedy as a literary/theatrical model.

Some 20th-century revisionist criticism suggests that &quot;deus ex machina&quot; cannot be viewed in these simplified terms, and contends that the device allows mortals to &quot;probe&quot; their relationship with the divine. Rush Rehm in particular cites examples of Greek tragedy in which the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; complicates the lives and attitudes of characters confronted by the deity, while simultaneously bringing the drama home to its audience. Sometimes, the unlikeliness of the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; plot device is employed deliberately. Note for example the comic effect generated in a scene in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; when Brian, who lives in Judea at the time of Christ, is saved from a high fall by a passing alien space-ship.

==Associated concepts ==
Thought experiments and speculations in theology, computer science, robotics and AI technology have considered the possibilities and consequences of a &quot;machina ex machina&quot; – a self-reproducing automaton.

<text>Frank Hughes Murkowski (born March 28, 1933) is an American politician. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a United States Senator representing Alaska from 1981 to 2002 and as the eighth governor of Alaska from 2002 to 2006.

Murkowski was the Republican nominee for Alaska&#x27;s sole congressional district in 1970, but lost to his Democratic opponent Nick Begich. In 1980, he was elected to the United States Senate, and was reelected in 1986, 1992, and 1998.

Murkowski ran for governor of Alaska in 2002 to replace Democratic incumbent Tony Knowles. He defeated Lieutenant Governor Fran Ulmer in the general election and took office on December 2, 2002. Murkowski resigned his U.S. Senate seat before taking office and appointed his daughter, Lisa Murkowski, to replace him. In his 2006 re-election bid, he finished in third place in the Republican primary behind Sarah Palin and John Binkley.

== Early life and education ==
Murkowski was born in Seattle, Washington, the son of Helen (née Hughes) and Frank M. Murkowski. His paternal grandfather was of Polish descent. Murkowski attended Ketchikan High School in Alaska, graduating in 1951. He studied at Santa Clara University from 1951 to 1953, and earned a BS in economics from Seattle University in 1955. He joined the United States Coast Guard in the summer of 1955 and served until 1957 – the year his daughter Lisa was born. He was stationed in Sitka and Ketchikan, Alaska, and aboard the cutters &quot;Sorrel&quot; and &quot;Thistle&quot;. Another daughter, Carol, is married to the son of State Sen. Arliss Sturgulewski, a former gubernatorial nominee.

== Career ==
After a stint at Pacific National Bank and further study at Pacific Coast Banking School, Murkowski became Alaska&#x27;s youngest commissioner at the time when he was appointed Commissioner of Economic Development, aged 33, and was elevated to the presidency of the Alaska National Bank of the North in 1971. He has also headed the Alaska Bankers Association and – in 1977 - the Alaska State Chamber of Commerce.

He ran for Alaska&#x27;s sole U.S. House seat in 1970, but was defeated in a landslide by Democratic state Senator Nick Begich.

=== U.S. Senate ===

He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1980, defeating Democratic candidate Clark Gruening, with the help of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s popularity. He won with 54% of the vote. He was re-elected in 1986, 1992, and 1998.
During his time in the Senate, he was most notable as Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee from 1995 to 2001. As chair, he argued and attempted unsuccessfully to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.

Murkowski had an anti-abortion record in the Senate. He also opposed gun control and affirmative action.

In a floor statement in the Senate, regarding the ban of homosexuals serving in the military, Murkowski stated that homosexuals have a right to choose their lifestyle, but there exists no right to serve. In his opposition to lifting the ban, his speech focused on the cost effect on the Veterans Administration in treating service members infected with HIV. His daughter and successor in the Senate, Lisa Murkowski, voted to repeal the ban on homosexuals in the armed services, and later became the third Republican Senator to endorse the legalization of same-sex marriage while in office.

=== Governor ===
Murkowski was elected governor on November 5, 2002, receiving nearly 56% of the vote, the highest percentage for any Republican gubernatorial nominee in Alaska history up until that point. He succeeded Democrat Tony Knowles and took office on December 2, 2002.

Upon his inauguration, he resigned his Senate seat and appointed his daughter, Lisa Murkowski, the Majority Leader-designate of the Alaska House of Representatives, in his place. The appointment was widely criticized as an act of nepotism.

Toward the end of his administration he brokered a deal for a gas pipeline that was never considered, in final form, by the legislature. Murkowski threatened to sign the deal without legislative approval, but the legislature successfully brought a lawsuit to enjoin him from doing so.

Governor Murkowski ran for re-election in 2006, but came in third behind former Wasilla Mayor Sarah Palin and businessman John Binkley in the Republican primary election on August 22, 2006 (Palin winning with 51% and Binkley taking second with 30% to Murkowski&#x27;s 19%). Murkowski&#x27;s margin of defeat was the largest in any Republican primary by an incumbent governor in United States history. Murkowski left office with one of the nation&#x27;s worst approval ratings of 19%.

On March 4, 2008, Murkowski&#x27;s former chief-of-staff, Jim Clark admitted that he was aware that Veco Corp had paid $10,000 for a political poll to gauge the popularity of then-incumbent Governor Murkowski. Clark was charged with &quot;honest services fraud&quot;. Before he was sentenced, the US Supreme Court ruled that the statute was drafted with unconstitutional vagueness and henceforth will only cover &quot;fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who ha[s] not been deceived.&quot; Since Clark was guilty of neither bribes nor kickbacks, all charges were voided.

In all 27 years of public service, Murkowski spent two years in the armed services, 21 years as Alaska&#x27;s junior senator in D.C. and four years as governor.

Murkowski considered attempting a return to the governorship in the 2018 election, but ultimately decided against it.

==== Jet plane scandal ====
In 2005, despite opposition from the Alaska Legislature, Murkowski purchased a Westwind II jet with state money for $2.7 million. This purchase became the symbol of his unpopular legacy in state politics, so much so that his successor, Sarah Palin, promised to sell the jet once she became governor.

<doc id="276734" wikidata="Q1545397" url="?curid=276734" title="Minimal surface">
<text>In mathematics, a minimal surface is a surface that locally minimizes its area. This is equivalent to having zero mean curvature (see definitions below).

The term &quot;minimal surface&quot; is used because these surfaces originally arose as surfaces that minimized total surface area subject to some constraint. Physical models of area-minimizing minimal surfaces can be made by dipping a wire frame into a soap solution, forming a soap film, which is a minimal surface whose boundary is the wire frame. However, the term is used for more general surfaces that may self-intersect or do not have constraints. For a given constraint there may also exist several minimal surfaces with different areas (for example, see minimal surface of revolution): the standard definitions only relate to a local optimum, not a global optimum.

==Definitions==
Minimal surfaces can be defined in several equivalent ways in formula_1. The fact that they are equivalent serves to demonstrate how minimal surface theory lies at the crossroads of several mathematical disciplines, especially differential geometry, calculus of variations, potential theory, complex analysis and mathematical physics.

:Local least area definition: A surface formula_2 is minimal if and only if every point &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot; has a neighbourhood, bounded by a simple closed curve, which has the least area among all surfaces having the same boundary.

This property is local: there might exist regions in a minimal surface, together with other surfaces of smaller area which have the same boundary. This property establishes a connection with soap films; a soap film deformed to have a wire frame as boundary will minimize area.

:Variational definition: A surface formula_2 is minimal if and only if it is a critical point of the area functional for all compactly supported variations.

This definition makes minimal surfaces a 2-dimensional analogue to geodesics, which are analogously defined as critical points of the length functional.

:Mean curvature definition: A surface formula_2 is minimal if and only if its mean curvature is equal to zero at all points.

A direct implication of this definition is that every point on the surface is a saddle point with equal and opposite principal curvatures. Additionally, this makes minimal surfaces into the static solutions of mean curvature flow. By the Young–Laplace equation, the mean curvature of a soap film is proportional to the difference in pressure between the sides. If the soap film does not enclose a region, then this will make its mean curvature zero. By contrast, a spherical soap bubble encloses a region which has a different pressure from the exterior region, and as such does not have zero mean curvature.

:Differential equation definition: A surface formula_2 formed by the image of a region formula_6 under function formula_7, formula_8, where formula_9 is a real valued function, is minimal if and only if formula_10 satisfies

::formula_11

The partial differential equation in this definition was originally found in 1762 by Lagrange, and Jean Baptiste Meusnier discovered in 1776 that it implied a vanishing mean curvature.

:Energy definition: A conformal immersion formula_12 is minimal if and only if it is a critical point of the Dirichlet energy for all compactly supported variations, or equivalently if any point formula_13 has a neighbourhood with least energy relative to its boundary.

This definition ties minimal surfaces to harmonic functions and potential theory.

:Harmonic definition: If formula_14 is an isometric immersion of a Riemann surface into 3-space, then formula_15 is said to be minimal whenever formula_16 is a harmonic function on formula_17 for each formula_18.

A direct implication of this definition and the maximum principle for harmonic functions is that there are no compact complete minimal surfaces in formula_1.

:Gauss map definition: A surface formula_2 is minimal if and only if its stereographically projected Gauss map formula_21 is meromorphic with respect to the underlying Riemann surface structure, and formula_17 is not a piece of a sphere.

This definition uses that the mean curvature is half of the trace of the shape operator, which is linked to the derivatives of the Gauss map. If the projected Gauss map obeys the Cauchy–Riemann equations then either the trace vanishes or every point of &quot;M&quot; is umbilic, in which case it is a piece of a sphere.

The local least area and variational definitions allow extending minimal surfaces to other Riemannian manifolds than formula_1.

==History==
Minimal surface theory originates with Lagrange who in 1762 considered the variational problem of finding the surface formula_24 of least area stretched across a given closed contour. He derived the Euler–Lagrange equation for the solution

:formula_25

He did not succeed in finding any solution beyond the plane. In 1776 Jean Baptiste Marie Meusnier discovered that the helicoid and catenoid satisfy the equation and that the differential expression corresponds to twice the mean curvature of the surface, concluding that surfaces with zero mean curvature are area-minimizing.

By expanding Lagrange&#x27;s equation to

:formula_26

Gaspard Monge and Legendre in 1795 derived representation formulas for the solution surfaces. While these were successfully used by Heinrich Scherk in 1830 to derive his surfaces, they were generally regarded as practically unusable. Catalan proved in 1842/43 that the helicoid is the only ruled minimal surface.

Progress had been fairly slow until the middle of the century when the Björling problem was solved using complex methods. The &quot;first golden age&quot; of minimal surfaces began. Schwarz found the solution of the Plateau problem for a regular quadrilateral in 1865 and for a general quadrilateral in 1867 (allowing the construction of his periodic surface families) using complex methods. Weierstrass and Enneper developed more useful representation formulas, firmly linking minimal surfaces to complex analysis and harmonic functions. Other important contributions came from Beltrami, Bonnet, Darboux, Lie, Riemann, Serret and Weingarten.

Between 1925 and 1950 minimal surface theory revived, now mainly aimed at nonparametric minimal surfaces. The complete solution of the Plateau problem by Jesse Douglas and Tibor Radó was a major milestone. Bernstein&#x27;s problem and Robert Osserman&#x27;s work on complete minimal surfaces of finite total curvature were also important.

Another revival began in the 1980s. One cause was the discovery in 1982 by Celso Costa of a surface that disproved the conjecture that the plane, the catenoid, and the helicoid are the only complete embedded minimal surfaces in formula_1 of finite topological type. This not only stimulated new work on using the old parametric methods, but also demonstrated the importance of computer graphics to visualise the studied surfaces and numerical methods to solve the &quot;period problem&quot; (when using the conjugate surface method to determine surface patches that can be assembled into a larger symmetric surface, certain parameters need to be numerically matched to produce an embedded surface). Another cause was the verification by H. Karcher that the triply periodic minimal surfaces originally described empirically by Alan Schoen in 1970 actually exist. This has led to a rich menagerie of surface families and methods of deriving new surfaces from old, for example by adding handles or distorting them.

Currently the theory of minimal surfaces has diversified to minimal submanifolds in other ambient geometries, becoming relevant to mathematical physics (e.g. the positive mass conjecture, the Penrose conjecture) and three-manifold geometry (e.g. the Smith conjecture, the Poincaré conjecture, the Thurston Geometrization Conjecture).

==Examples==
Classical examples of minimal surfaces include:
* the plane, which is a trivial case
* catenoids: minimal surfaces made by rotating a catenary once around its directrix
* helicoids: A surface swept out by a line rotating with uniform velocity around an axis perpendicular to the line and simultaneously moving along the axis with uniform velocity

Surfaces from the 19th century golden age include:
* Schwarz minimal surfaces: triply periodic surfaces that fill formula_1
* Riemann&#x27;s minimal surface: A posthumously described periodic surface
* the Enneper surface
* the Henneberg surface: the first non-orientable minimal surface
* Bour&#x27;s minimal surface
* the Neovius surface: a triply periodic surface

Modern surfaces include:
* the Gyroid: One of Schoen&#x27;s surfaces from 1970, a triply periodic surface of particular interest for liquid crystal structure
* the Saddle tower family: generalisations of Scherk&#x27;s second surface
* Costa&#x27;s minimal surface: Famous conjecture disproof. Described in 1982 by Celso Costa and later visualized by Jim Hoffman. Jim Hoffman, David Hoffman and William Meeks III then extended the definition to produce a family of surfaces with different rotational symmetries.
* the Chen–Gackstatter surface family, adding handles to the Enneper surface.

==Generalisations and links to other fields==
Minimal surfaces can be defined in other manifolds than formula_1, such as hyperbolic space, higher-dimensional spaces or Riemannian manifolds.

The definition of minimal surfaces can be generalized/extended to cover constant-mean-curvature surfaces: surfaces with a constant mean curvature, which need not equal zero.

The curvature lines of an isothermal surface form an isothermal net.

In discrete differential geometry discrete minimal surfaces are studied: simplicial complexes of triangles that minimize their area under small perturbations of their vertex positions. Such discretizations are often used to approximate minimal surfaces numerically, even if no closed form expressions are known.

Brownian motion on a minimal surface leads to probabilistic proofs of several theorems on minimal surfaces.

Minimal surfaces have become an area of intense scientific study, especially in the areas of molecular engineering and materials science, due to their anticipated applications in self-assembly of complex materials. The endoplasmic reticulum, an important structure in cell biology, is proposed to be under evolutionary pressure to conform to a nontrivial minimal surface.

In the fields of general relativity and Lorentzian geometry, certain extensions and modifications of the notion of minimal surface, known as apparent horizons, are significant. In contrast to the event horizon, they represent a curvature-based approach to understanding black hole boundaries.
Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents.

Minimal surfaces are part of the generative design toolbox used by modern designers. In architecture there has been much interest in tensile structures, which are closely related to minimal surfaces. Notable examples can be seen in the work of Frei Otto, Shigeru Ban, and Zaha Hadid. The design of the Munich Olympic Stadium by Frei Otto was inspired by soap surfaces. Another notable example, also by Frei Otto, is the German Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal, Canada.

In the art world, minimal surfaces have been extensively explored in the sculpture of Robert Engman (1927–2018), Robert Longhurst (1949– ), and Charles O. Perry (1929–2011), among others.

<doc id="276741" wikidata="Q642231" url="?curid=276741" title="Medium-density fibreboard">
<text>Medium-density fibreboard (MDF) is an engineered wood product made by breaking down hardwood or softwood residuals into wood fibre, often in a defibrator, combining it with wax and a resin binder, and forming it into panels by applying high temperature and pressure. MDF is generally denser than plywood. It is made up of separated fibre but can be used as a building material similar in application to plywood. It is stronger and denser than particle board.

The name derives from the distinction in densities of fibreboard. Large-scale production of MDF began in the 1980s, in both North America and Europe.

Over time, the term &quot;MDF&quot; has become a generic name for any dry-process fibreboard.

==Physical properties==
MDF is typically made up of 82% wood fibre, 9% urea-formaldehyde resin glue, 8% water, and 1% paraffin wax. The density is typically between . The range of density and classification as light-, standard-, or high-density board is a misnomer and confusing. The density of the board, when evaluated in relation to the density of the fibre that goes into making the panel, is important. A thick MDF panel at a density of may be considered as high density in the case of softwood fibre panels, whereas a panel of the same density made of hardwood fibres is not regarded as so. The evolution of the various types of MDF has been driven by differing need for specific applications.

==Types==
The different kinds of MDF (sometimes labeled by colour) are:
* Ultralight MDF plate (ULDF)
* Moisture-resistant board is typically green
* Fire retardant MDF is typically red or blue
In Europe, MDF is classified for use by the standard EN 622-5, such as load-bearing for general dry or humid conditions. The light and ultralight MDF are also classified by EN 622-5 for general (non-load-bearing) use.

Although similar manufacturing processes are used in making all types of fibreboard, MDF has a typical density of 600–800 kg/m3 or 0.022–0.029 lb/in3, in contrast to particle board (500–800 kg/m3) and to high-density fibreboard (600–1,450 kg/m3). In addition, MDF typically has an MOR of 40 MPa and an MOE of 3 GPa. Because it is easier to machine and has good weathering characteristics, it tends to replace particleboard in applications such as furniture, cabinet making, joinery, craft work and flooring.

==Manufacturing==

In Australia and New Zealand, the main species of tree used for MDF is plantation-grown radiata pine, but a variety of other products have also been used, including other woods, waste paper, and fibres. Where moisture resistance is desired, a proportion of eucalypt species may be used, making use of the endemic oil content of such trees.

=== Chip production ===
The trees are debarked after being cut. The bark can be sold for use in landscaping or used as biomass fuel in on-site furnaces. The debarked logs are sent to the MDF plant, where they go through the chipping process. A typical disk chipper contains four to 16 blades. Any resulting chips that are too large may be rechipped; undersized chips may be used as fuel. The chips are then washed and checked for defects. Chips may be stored in bulk, as a reserve for manufacturing.

=== Fibre production ===
Compared to other fibre boards, such as Masonite, MDF is characterised by the next part of the process, and how the fibres are processed as individual, but intact, fibres and vessels, manufactured through a dry process. The chips are then compacted into small plugs using a screw feeder, heated for 30–120 seconds to soften the lignin in the wood, then fed into a defibrator. A typical defibrator consists of two counter-rotating discs with grooves in their faces. Chips are fed into the centre and are fed outwards between the discs by centrifugal force. The decreasing size of the grooves gradually separates the fibres, aided by the softened lignin between them.

From the defibrator, the pulp enters a blowline, a distinctive part of the MDF process. This is an expanding circular pipeline, initially 40 mm in diameter, increasing to 1500 mm. Wax is injected in the first stage, which coats the fibres and is distributed evenly by the turbulent movement of the fibres. A urea-formaldehyde resin is then injected as the main bonding agent. The wax improves moisture resistance and the resin initially helps reduce clumping. The material dries quickly in the final heated expansion chamber of the blowline and expands into a fine, fluffy and lightweight fibre. The glue and the other components (hardener, dye, urea, and so on) can be injected into blowline even at a high pressure () and the drying process continues inside a long pipe to the exit cyclones, that is connected to the heating chamber. This fibre may be used immediately, or stored.

=== Sheet forming ===
Dry fibre is sucked into the top of a &quot;pendistor&quot;, which evenly distributes fibre into a uniform mat below it, usually of 230–610 mm thickness. The mat is precompressed and either sent straight to a continuous hot press or cut into large sheets for a multiple-opening hot press. The hot press activates the bonding resin and sets the strength and density profile. The pressing cycle operates in stages, with the mat thickness being first compressed to around 1.5 times the finished board thickness, then compressed further in stages and held for a short period. This gives a board profile with zones of increased density, thus mechanical strength, near the two faces of the board and a less dense core.

After pressing, MDF is cooled in a star dryer or cooling carousel, trimmed, and sanded. In certain applications, boards are also laminated for extra strength.

The environmental impact of MDF has greatly improved over the years. Today, many MDF boards are made from a variety of materials. These include other woods, scrap, recycled paper, bamboo, carbon fibres and polymers, forest thinnings, and sawmill off-cuts.

As manufacturers are being pressured to come up with greener products, they have started testing and using nontoxic binders. New raw materials are being introduced. Straw and bamboo are becoming popular fibres because they are a fast-growing, renewable resource.

==Comparison with natural woods==
MDF does not contain knots or rings, making it more uniform than natural woods during cutting and in service. However, MDF is not entirely isotropic since the fibres are pressed tightly together through the sheet. Typical MDF has a hard, flat, smooth surface that makes it ideal for veneering, as no underlying grain is available to telegraph through the thin veneer as with plywood. A so-called &quot;premium&quot; MDF is available that features more uniform density throughout the thickness of the panel.

MDF may be glued, doweled, or laminated. Typical fasteners are T-nuts and pan-head machine screws. Smooth-shank nails do not hold well, and neither do fine-pitch screws, especially in the edge. Special screws are available with a coarse thread pitch, but sheet-metal screws also work well. MDF is not susceptible to splitting when screws are installed in the face of the material, but due to the alignment of the wood fibres, may split when screws are installed in the edge of the board without pilot holes.

===Advantages===
* Denser than plywood and chipboard
* Consistent in strength and size
* Shapes well
* Stable dimensions (less expansion and contraction than natural wood)
* Takes paint well
* Takes wood glue well
* High screw pull-out strength in the face grain of the material
* Flexible

===Disadvantages===
* Low-grade MDF may swell and break when saturated with water
* May warp or expand in humid environments if not sealed
* May release formaldehyde, which is a known human carcinogen and may cause allergy, eye and lung irritation when cutting and sanding
* Dulls blades more quickly than many woods: Use of tungsten carbide-edged cutting tools is almost mandatory, as high-speed steel dulls too quickly.
* Though it does not have a grain in the plane of the board, it does have one &quot;into&quot; the board. Screwing into the edge of a board will generally cause it to split in a fashion similar to delaminating.

== Applications ==

MDF is often used in school projects because of its flexibility.
Slatwall panels made from MDF are used in the shop fitting industry.
MDF is primarily used for indoor applications due to its poor moisture resistance. It is available in raw form, or with a finely sanded surface, or with a decorative overlay.

MDF is also usable for furniture such as cabinets, because of its strong surface.

MDF&#x27;s density makes it a useful material for the walls of pipe-organ chambers, allowing sound, particularly bass, to be reflected out of the chamber into the hall.

== Safety concerns==

When MDF is cut, a large quantity of dust particulate is released into the air.

Formaldehyde resins are commonly used to bind together the fibres in MDF, and testing has consistently revealed that MDF products emit free formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds that pose health risks at concentrations considered unsafe, for at least several months after manufacture. Urea-formaldehyde is always being slowly released from the edges and surface of MDF. When painting, coating all sides of the finished piece is a good practice to seal in the free formaldehyde. Wax and oil finishes may be used as finishes, but they are less effective at sealing in the free formaldehyde.

Whether these constant emissions of formaldehyde reach harmful levels in real-world environments is not fully determined. The primary concern is for the industries using formaldehyde. As far back as 1987, the United States Environmental Protection Agency classified it as a &quot;probable human carcinogen&quot;, and after more studies, the World Health Organization&#x27;s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), in 1995, also classified it as a &quot;probable human carcinogen&quot;. Further information and evaluation of all known data led the IARC to reclassify formaldehyde as a &quot;known human carcinogen&quot; associated with nasal sinus cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer, and possibly with leukaemia in June 2004.

According to International Composite Board Emission Standards, three European formaldehyde classes are used, E0, E1, and E2, based on the measurement of formaldehyde emission levels. For instance, E0 is classified as having less than 3 mg of formaldehyde out of every 100 g of the glue used in particleboard and plywood fabrication. E1 and E2 are classified as having 9 and 30 g of formaldehyde per 100 g of glue, respectively. All around the world, variable certification and labeling schemes are there for such products that can be explicit to formaldehyde release, such as that of Californian Air Resources Board.

== Veneered MDF ==
Veneered MDF provides many of the advantages of MDF with a decorative wood veneer surface layer. In modern construction, spurred by the high costs of hardwoods, manufacturers have been adopting this approach to achieve a high-quality finishing wrap covering over a standard MDF board. One common type uses oak veneer. Making veneered MDF is a complex procedure, which involves taking a slice of hardwood about thick and then, through high pressure and stretching methods, wrapping them around the profiled MDF boards. This is possible only with simple profiles; otherwise, when the thin wood layer dries, it breaks at bends and angles.
