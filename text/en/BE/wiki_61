<text>SJ is the primary passenger train operator in Sweden. A wholly state-owned company operated for-profit under market conditions, SJ operates various services across Sweden. SJ&#x27;s operations include high-speed trains, intercity trains, night trains, and regional trains, with some services extending into Denmark, Norway and Germany.

SJ traces its roots back to 1856, however was established in its current form as a passenger train operator (SJ AB) in 2001, following the restructuring of &quot;Statens Järnvägar&quot;, the former government agency responsible for the Swedish railways. SJ AB also has subsidiaries such as &quot;SJ Götalandståg&quot;, &quot;SJ Stockholmståg&quot;, and &quot;SJ Norge AS&quot;, which operate procured regional services in Western Sweden, Stockholm County and Norway, respectively. In 2018, SJ carried 31.8 million passengers.

==Overview==
SJ AB was formed in 2001, following the restructuring of &quot;Statens Järnvägar.&quot; This restructuring divided the agency into six separate state-owned limited companies, including SJ for passenger trains, Green Cargo for freight, and Jernhusen for railway buildings. SJ&#x27;s operations fall broadly into subsidised and unsubsidised services. The unsubsidised services ran until the 2011 monopoly. The subsidised trains are awarded through competitive bids. However, some trains fall in between these categories, since public transit agencies can pay SJ to allow transit pass holders access to SJ&#x27;s trains.

SJ received a government bailout a few years after its creation, but has since had profit margins of up to ten percent. All train operators in Sweden pay low track access charges to the track authority, Trafikverket.

=== Current ===

==== X2 ====

The X2 trains (Operated by SJ as X 2000) launched in 1990, and are used for higher-speed services and have a top speed of 200 km/h (125 mph). Built in Sweden by Kalmar Verkstad, later ADtranz, they feature tilting technology to reduce the effects of high-speed turns. These trains serve several routes, including Stockholm-Gothenburg (Västra Stambanan) and Stockholm-Malmö-Copenhagen (Södra Stambanan and Öresund Line). They have also previously served the Stockholm-Sundsvall, Stockholm-Strömstad, Stockholm-Oslo, and Stockholm-Östersund-(Duved) lines, with seasonal services on some of these routes. Currently, about 40 X2 sets are in operation. Since 2021 the X2 fleet has been undergoing refurbishment, due for completion in 2026.

==== X40 ====

The X40 is a double-decker Coradia Duplex train built by Alstom used for regional services, launched in 2006. It typically serves shorter routes, such as the Stockholm-Uppsala line (Uppsalapendeln), which is often composed of eight cars. These trains are typically used for services that do not travel longer than 4 hours, with some exceptions like the Coast to Coast (Gothenburg-Kalmar) and Stockholm-Gothenburg via Västerås. The X40 has no catering service, and most of these trains are composed of second-class cars, with the exception of some services that feature some compartments designated first-class. The X40 fleet is undergoing refurbishment by VR Group in Oulu, due to be complete in 2027.

==== X55 ====

The X55 (operated by SJ as &quot;SJ 3000&quot;) is a newer train model built by Bombardier introduced in 2012. It has a top speed of 200 km/h and serves various routes, often north of Stockholm, including Stockholm-Östersund-(Duved) (Mittbanan-Norra Stambanan), Stockholm-Uddevalla (Västra Stambanan and Bohusbanan), Stockholm-Gothenburg, Stockholm-Sundsvall-Umeå (Ostkustbanan, Botniabanan), Gothenburg-Malmö (Västkustbanan), Stockholm-Oslo, Stockholm-Karlstad (Västra Stambanan and Värmlandsbanan/Kongsvingerbanen), and Stockholm-Falun/Mora (Dalabanan).

==== X50 and X52 ====

The X50 and X52 trains are used for regional services and are part of the push-pull trainset configurations. These trains generally do not serve meals or drinks, and are used on routes that do not exceed four hours in duration. While most SJ trains have first-class compartments, the X50 and X52 sets typically do not.

==== Rc-hauled Trains ====

Many InterCity services are often operated using Rc-hauled trains, which are paired with various carriages, such as the SJ B7, or other first class, second class, and sleeper carriages. The Rc-hauled trains often also feature an onboard bistro car.

=== Future ===

==== Alstom Zefiro Express (SJ Zefiro Express) ====
25 high-speed Zefiro Express high-speed trains (currently named/called the SJ Zefiro Express), scheduled to enter service in 2027, will operate on routes including Stockholm–Malmö, Stockholm–Gothenburg, and be certified for cross-border services to Denmark and Norway. The trains, with a top speed of 250 km/h, and are designed to handle running at temperatures of -40 degrees. The contract, valued at SEK 7 billion (EUR 630 million), was awarded to Bombardier (now part of Alstom) by SJ in 2021.

==== CAF Civity Nordic ====
25 CAF Civity Nordic, scheduled to enter service in 2027, will operate on regional routes including Stockholm-Västerås-Örebro-Skövde-Gothenburg, Linköping-Norrköping-Stockholm-Arlanda-Uppsala-Gävle-Ljusdal and Kalmar-Gothenburg. The trains are designed for cold weather conditions in Sweden, and can operate with a top speed of 200 km/h. The contract, valued at EUR 300 million, was awarded to CAF by SJ in 2022.

==Services==

===Sleeper services - SJ Nattåg===
The SJ overnight train services (Swedish: &quot;SJ Nattåg&quot;) are Rc locomotive-hauled trains with both sleeper wagons as well as standard wagons. All services except for the Stockholm-Malmö route have a bistro wagon.
As of 2022 SJ has in collaboration with DSB and RDC begun to operate night train services between Sweden and Germany through Denmark.
Three different locomotives are used due to compatibility issues with the electrification and signaling systems between the three countries.
Within Sweden are SJ Rc locomotives used, and in Denmark are DSB EA used, and in Germany are DB 101 used.
The night-trains are operated on the following lines:

===SJ InterCity===
The InterCity services are Rc-hauled trains with standard-seating carriages in both first and second class. There is always a bistro car available in the trainset.

Lines with InterCity service:
===SJ Regional===
Most of the SJ Regional network was concentrated in the area around lake Mälaren. Operated with either Rc-hauled trainsets, X12/X14 or X40 EMUs. These trains have no catering on board. The X40 is equipped with free 4G WiFi. Both first and second-class are usually offered. Most of this network has been incorporated into the new Mälartåg franchise, although some services remain outside of it.

Routes listed below are the satellite routes which are not subject to franchising. 

====Franchised operations====
SJ operate a couple of regional rail franchises held by public transport authorities around the country. The most significant of these are Mälartåg and Västtågen serving the Mälaren valley and the region of West Götaland respectively. SJ AB also started operating the Öresundståg franchise for the 2020 timetable, taking over from Transdev. But due to serious inconsistencies between partners the contract will be terminated as of December 2022 where Transdev will take over again
MTR took over the Mälartåg contract in December 2021.

The stretch Malmö Central to Copenhagen Central is operated 50/50 alongside Danish State Railways (DSB) and Copenhagen to Østerport/Nivå by DSB only.

The initial contract for the Mälartåg franchise states that the operator may use their own fleet [of X12, X40 and X50 stock] until the delivery of ER1 Stadler Dosto 200 EMUs is completed. The Upptåget franchise will be merged into Mälartåg onwards from the 2022 timetable, meaning that services from Gävle gain additional stations inherited from the termination of the Upptåget franchise.

===SJ higher speed trains===
SJ higher speed trains (Swedish: &quot;SJ Snabbtåg&quot;) are X2 or X55 trains operating on the main routes in Sweden. The trains are equipped with WiFi and have a bistro.

Stops at Arlanda and Uppsala are for boarding northbound or alighting southbound respectively, although passengers with railcards are exempted from this rule. Some services do also allow both boarding and alighting at Arlanda and Uppsala respectively.

===SJ Norge===
On 7 June 2020 SJ Norge commenced operating services on the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, as well as the Meråker, Røros, Rauma, Nordland, the Saltpendel Line and the Dovre Regional Line under a 10-year contract with the Norwegian Railway Directorate.

==Ticketing==
Ticket prices on SJ trains vary, similarly to airfares, with the lowest prices typically available when booking ahead. SJ offers different ticket categories, such as non-rebookable and refundable tickets, each with varying levels of flexibility. Additionally, there are certain discounts for seniors, students, youths, and families.

In September 2023, SJ removed its ticket machines from stations. The machines were phased out due to a decline in customer usage and the machines&#x27; reliance on older technology. SJ directs passengers to purchase tickets via their website, the SJ app, or through authorised agents. It is not possible to buy tickets on board SJ&#x27;s trains. Additionally, since September 2009, passengers are required to carry an identity document while traveling on SJ trains.

<doc id="286266" wikidata="Q200437" url="?curid=286266" title="Stalker (1979 film)">
<text>Stalker () is a 1979 Soviet science fiction film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky with a screenplay written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, loosely based on their 1972 novel &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot;. The film tells the story of an expedition led by a figure known as the &quot;Stalker&quot; (Alexander Kaidanovsky), who guides his two clients—a melancholic writer (Anatoly Solonitsyn) and a professor (Nikolai Grinko)—through a hazardous wasteland to a mysterious restricted site known simply as the &quot;Zone&quot;, where there supposedly exists a room which grants a person&#x27;s innermost desires. The film combines elements of science fiction and fantasy with dramatic philosophical, and psychological themes.

The film was initially filmed over a year on film stock that was later discovered to be unusable, and had to be almost entirely reshot with new cinematographer Alexander Knyazhinsky. &quot;Stalker&quot; was released by Goskino in May 1979. Upon release, the film garnered praise in the Soviet and Warsaw Pact press, but only mixed reviews in the West, but in subsequent years it has been recognized as one of the greatest films of all time, with the British Film Institute ranking it #29 on its 2012 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Films of All Time&quot;. The film sold over 4 million tickets, mostly in the Soviet Union, against a budget of 1 million roubles.

== Plot ==
A man works as a &quot;Stalker&quot;, leading people through the &quot;Zone&quot;, an area where the normal laws of physics do not apply, and remnants of seemingly extraterrestrial activity lie undisturbed among its ruins. At the heart of the Zone lies a &quot;Room,&quot; which is said to grant the wishes of anyone who steps inside. The Zone contains ominous, supernatural hazards. The government bans anyone from entering the Zone and subjects Stalkers to long prison sentences if caught.

The Stalker has just returned from prison to his wife and daughter. To his wife&#x27;s horror, two men, a &quot;Writer&quot; and a &quot;Professor,&quot; hire him to guide them to the Zone. He meets his clients in a rundown bar-café, and warns them that they must do exactly as he says to survive the dangers that lie ahead. He explains that the Zone is a living thing that visitors must respect, and warns that within the Zone, the straightest path is not always the shortest path. 

The group evades the Zone&#x27;s military guards by following a train inside the gate. They ride into the heart of the Zone on a railway work car. The Stalker tests for gravitational anomalies by throwing metal nuts tied to strips of cloth. The Writer is skeptical of any real danger, but the Professor generally follows the Stalker&#x27;s advice.

As they travel, the three men discuss their reasons for wanting to visit the Room. The Writer expresses his fear of losing his inspiration. The Professor seems less anxious, but insists on carrying along a small backpack. The Professor admits he hopes to win a Nobel Prize for scientific analysis of the Zone. The Stalker insists that he has no motive beyond the altruistic aim of aiding the desperate to their desires. He mentions that another Stalker, named &quot;Porcupine,&quot; obtained great riches by entering the Room and then hanged himself. 

After traveling through the fields and tunnels, the three finally reach their destination: a decrepit industrial building. The men hesitate as the Room is guarded by a &quot;Meat Grinder&quot; anomaly that requires a death for someone to enter the Room proper, which causes an argument. In a small antechamber, a phone rings. The surprised Professor decides to use the phone to telephone his former boss to gloat about finding the Room. As the trio prepare to enter the Room, the Professor reveals his true intentions in undertaking the journey. The Professor has brought a 20-kiloton bomb to destroy the Room and prevent evil men from abusing it for their own gain. He blames the Room, the Stalkers, and their clients for the rise of crime, social strife, military coups, and destructive science. The three men enter a physical and verbal standoff just outside the Room that leaves them exhausted.

It turns out that the Room&#x27;s ability to grant one&#x27;s deepest desire serves as a mirror into the soul. The Writer deduces that Porcupine committed suicide because he sent his brother to his death in the Meat Grinder and entered the Room to wish for his brother back, only for the Room to realize that Porcupine valued money more than his brother&#x27;s life. The Professor gives up on his plan of destroying the Room, and disassembles the bomb. Although the Writer asserts that it is impossible to use the Room for selfish reasons because nobody can know their true desires, no one attempts to enter the Room.

The Stalker, the Writer, and the Professor are met back at the bar-café by the Stalker&#x27;s wife and daughter. After returning home, the Stalker laments to his wife how humanity has lost its capacity for faith, which is needed to traverse the Zone and live a good life. As the Stalker sleeps, his wife contemplates their relationship in a monologue delivered directly to the camera. She says that she would prefer an interesting life of hardship than an easy, boring one. Martyshka, the couple&#x27;s deformed daughter, sits alone in the kitchen reading while a love poem by Fyodor Tyutchev is recited. She appears to use psychokinesis to push three drinking glasses across the table, but that is made ambiguous as simultaneously a train passes by the family&#x27;s apartment and the whole room shakes.

== Title ==
The meaning of the word &quot;stalker&quot; was derived from its use by the Strugatsky brothers in their novel &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot;, upon which the movie is based. In &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot;, &quot;Stalker&quot; was a common nickname for men engaged in the illegal enterprise of prospecting for and smuggling alien artifacts out of the &quot;Zone&quot;. According to author Boris Strugatsky, &quot;prospectors&quot; and &quot;trappers&quot; were potential word choices before &quot;stalker&quot; was decided on, which was at least partially inspired by Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s character &quot;Stalky&quot; in his &quot;Stalky &amp; Co.&quot; stories, of which both authors were fans. Their adaptation of the English word into Russian is pronounced slightly differently as &quot;Stullker&quot;, and it came into common usage after being &quot;coined&quot; by the authors.

Tarkovsky also wrote &quot;Stalker is from the word &#x27;to stalk&#x27;—to creep.&quot; in a 1976 diary entry.

In the film, a &quot;stalker&quot; is a professional guide to the Zone, someone having the ability and desire to cross the border into the dangerous and forbidden place with a specific goal.

== Themes and interpretations ==
In a review in &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, critic Nick Schager describes the film as a &quot;dense, complex, often-contradictory, and endlessly pliable allegory about human consciousness, the necessity for faith in an increasingly secular, rational world, and the ugly, unpleasant dreams and desires that reside in the hearts of men&quot;, while conceding that the obliqueness of the imagery renders definitive interpretation &quot;both pointless... [and] somewhat futile&quot;.

Several critics have identified the nature of human desire as a central theme of the film. James Berardinelli interprets the film as suggesting that &quot;one&#x27;s innermost desire may not be what one thinks it is and that one may be better off not achieving it&quot;, while Schager describes the film as capturing &quot;the essence of what man is made of... a yearning for something that&#x27;s simultaneously beyond our reach and yet intrinsic to every one of us&quot;.

Geoff Dyer argues the Stalker is &quot;seeking asylum from the world&quot;, and says that &quot;while the film may not be about the gulag, it is haunted by memories of the camps, from the overlap of vocabulary (&quot;Zona&quot;, &quot;the meat grinder&quot;) to the Stalker&#x27;s Zek-style shaved head&quot;.

Writer Lilya Kaganovsky says the film&#x27;s mysterious Zone drawn comparisons with the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone that was established in 1986 (seven years after the release of the film) in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, and some of the people employed to take care of the Chernobyl power plant referred to themselves as &quot;stalkers&quot;. Though the film does not specify the origin of the Zone, near the end, in a shot of the Stalker with his family outside the Zone, what appears to be a power plant is visible in the background. The themes of nuclear radiation and environmental degradation would be revisited by Tarkovsky in his final film, &quot;The Sacrifice&quot;.

Midway in the film, the Stalker has an interior monologue in which he quotes the entire section 76 of Lao Tse&#x27;s Tao Te Ching, the text of which characterizes softness and pliancy as qualities of a newborn, hence, new life; hardness and strength, on the contrary, are qualities nearing death. (&quot;Man, when he enters life, is soft and weak. When he dies he is hard and strong.&quot;)

Slavistic Nils Åke Nilsson says that in the context of late Soviet stagnation, Tarkovsky makes a contrast between the oppressive dystopia of the outside world—marked by industrial decay, pollution, alienation, and political repression—and the Zone, a realm of beauty and mystery. In conjunction with the Room, they act as a representations of new possibilities, a utopia amidst the anti-utopian world of modern society, offering an escape from the constraints of the decaying society. The film reflects the disillusionment of late socialism, which fell short of the communist utopia, resulting in a stagnant and sterile reality.

In this film, Tarkovsky wishes to emphasize two essentially human aspects, faith and love. He believes that faith &quot;cannot be dissolved or broken down, [it] forms like a crystal in the soul of each of us and constitutes its great worth,&quot; and that when humans feel that there is no more hope in the world, love is what proves them otherwise. The Writer feels as though the world has become mundane and ordinary, and has become cynical of it, he desires to be shaken by the unknown that is the zone. What ends up surprising him is not the zone, but instead, the Stalker&#x27;s wife and her faithfulness to the stalker even after all he has put her through, &quot;her love and her devotion are that final miracle which can be set against the unbelief, cynicism, moral vacuum poisoning the modern world, of which both the Writer and the Scientist are victims&quot;, in Tarkovsky&#x27;s films, he believes that it is his responsibility to make his viewers aware and reflect on their need to love and to give their love.

== Style ==
Like Tarkovsky&#x27;s other films, &quot;Stalker&quot; relies on long takes with slow, subtle camera movement, rejecting the use of rapid montage. The film contains 142 shots in 163 minutes, with an average shot length of more than one minute and many shots lasting for more than four minutes. Almost all of the scenes not set in the Zone are in sepia or a similar high-contrast brown monochrome, with the exception of scenes featuring Stalker&#x27;s daughter, shot in colour.

== Production ==
=== Writing ===
After reading the novel &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot;, by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, Tarkovsky initially recommended it to a friend, the film director Mikhail Kalatozov, thinking Kalatozov might be interested in adapting it into a film. Kalatozov abandoned the project when he could not obtain the rights to the novel. Tarkovsky then became very interested in adapting the novel and expanding its concepts. He hoped it would allow him to make a film which conformed to the classical Aristotelian unity; a single action, on a single location, within 24 hours (single point in time).

Tarkovsky viewed the idea of the Zone as a dramatic tool to draw out the personalities of the three protagonists, particularly the psychological damage from everything that happens to the idealistic views of the Stalker as he finds himself unable to make others happy: &quot;This, too, is what Stalker is about: the hero goes through moments of despair when his faith is shaken; but every time he comes to a renewed sense of his vocation to serve people who have lost their hopes and illusions.&quot; The film departs considerably from the novel. According to an interview with Tarkovsky in 1979, the film has basically nothing in common with the novel except for the two words &quot;Stalker&quot; and &quot;Zone&quot;.

Yet, several similarities remain between the novel and the film. In both works, the Zone is guarded by a police or military guard, apparently authorized to use deadly force. The Stalker in both works tests the safety of his path by tossing nuts and bolts tied with scraps of cloth, verifying that gravity is working as usual. A character named Porcupine is a mentor to Stalker. In the novel, frequent visits to the Zone increase the likelihood of abnormalities in the visitor&#x27;s offspring. In the book, the Stalker&#x27;s daughter has light hair all over her body, while in the film she is crippled and has psychokinetic abilities. The &#x27;meat grinder&#x27;, a particularly perilous location, is mentioned in both film and the book. Neither in the novel nor in the film do the women enter the Zone — indeed, the film features a female character who is introduced as wishing to enter the Zone, but who is dismissed by the Stalker prior to departure. Finally, the target of the expedition in both works is a wish-granting device.

In &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot;, the site was specifically described as the site of alien visitation; the name of the novel derives from a metaphor proposed by a character who compares the visit to a roadside picnic. The closing monologue by the Stalker&#x27;s wife at the end of the film has no equivalent in the novel. An early draft of the screenplay was published as a novel titled &quot;Stalker&quot;, or &quot;The Wish Machine&quot;, that differs substantially from the finished film.

=== Filming ===
In an interview on the MK2 DVD, the production designer, Rashit Safiullin, recalled that Tarkovsky spent a year shooting all the outdoor scenes. However, when the crew returned to Moscow, they found that the film had been improperly developed and their footage was unusable. The film had been shot on new Kodak 5247 stock with which Soviet laboratories were not very familiar. Even before the film stock problem was discovered, relations between Tarkovsky and &quot;Stalker&quot;″s first cinematographer, Georgy Rerberg, had deteriorated. After seeing the poorly developed material, Tarkovsky fired Rerberg. Safiullin contends that Tarkovsky was so despondent at having to discard all the outdoor work that he wanted to abandon further work on the film.

After the loss of the film stock, the Soviet film boards wanted to shut the film down, but Tarkovsky came up with a solution: he asked to be allowed to make a two-part film, which meant additional deadlines and more funds. Tarkovsky ended up reshooting almost all of the film with a new cinematographer, Alexander Knyazhinsky. According to Safiullin, the finished version of &quot;Stalker&quot; is completely different from the one Tarkovsky originally shot.

The documentary film &quot;Rerberg and Tarkovsky: The Reverse Side of &quot;Stalker&quot;&quot; by Igor Mayboroda offers a different interpretation of the relationship between Rerberg and Tarkovsky. Rerberg felt that Tarkovsky was not ready for this script. He told Tarkovsky to rewrite the script in order to achieve a good result. Tarkovsky ignored him and continued shooting. After several arguments, Tarkovsky sent Rerberg home. Ultimately, Tarkovsky shot &quot;Stalker&quot; three times, consuming over of film. People who have seen both the first version shot by Rerberg (as Director of Photography) and the final theatrical release say that they are almost identical. Tarkovsky sent home other crew members in addition to Rerberg, excluding them from the credits, as well.
The central part of the film, in which the characters travel within the Zone, was shot in a few days at two deserted hydro power plants on the Jägala river near Tallinn, Estonia. The shot before they enter the Zone is an old Flora chemical factory in the center of Tallinn, next to the old Rotermann salt storage (now Museum of Estonian Architecture), and the former Tallinn Power Plant, now Tallinn Creative Hub, where a memorial plate of the film was set up in 2008. Some shots within the Zone were filmed in Maardu, next to the Iru Power Plant, while the shot with the gates to the Zone was filmed in Lasnamäe, next to Punane Street behind the Idakeskus. Other shots were filmed near the Tallinn–Narva highway bridge on the Pirita river. A small set was built in Moscow not far from the CHPP-20 thermal power plant for the scene exiting the bar.

Several people involved in the film production, and possibly Tarkovsky himself, died from causes that some crew members attributed to the film&#x27;s long shooting schedule in toxic locations. Sound designer Vladimir Sharun recalled:
== Soundtrack ==
The &quot;Stalker&quot; film score was composed by Eduard Artemyev, who had also composed the scores for Tarkovsky&#x27;s previous films &quot;Solaris&quot; and &quot;Mirror&quot;. For &quot;Stalker&quot;, Artemyev composed and recorded two different versions of the score. The first score was done with an orchestra alone but was rejected by Tarkovsky. The second score that was used in the final film was created on a synthesizer along with traditional instruments that were manipulated using sound effects.

In the final film score, the boundaries between music and sound were blurred, as natural sounds and music interact to the point where they are indistinguishable. In fact, many of the natural sounds were not production sounds but were created by Artemyev on his synthesizer.

For Tarkovsky, music was more than just a parallel illustration of the visual image. He believed that music distorts and changes the emotional tone of a visual image while not changing the meaning. He also believed that in a film with complete theoretical consistency, music will have no place and that instead music is replaced by sounds. According to Tarkovsky, he aimed at this consistency and moved into this direction in &quot;Stalker&quot; and &quot;Nostalghia&quot;.

In addition to the original monophonic soundtrack, the Russian Cinema Council (Ruscico) created an alternative 5.1 surround sound track for the 2001 DVD release. In addition to remixing the mono soundtrack, music and sound effects were removed and added in several scenes. Music was added to the scene where the three are traveling to the Zone on a motorized draisine. In the opening and the final scene Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Ninth Symphony&quot; was removed and in the opening scene in Stalker&#x27;s house ambient sounds were added, changing the original soundtrack, in which this scene was completely silent except for the sound of a train.

=== Film score ===

Initially, Tarkovsky had no clear understanding of the musical atmosphere of the final film and only an approximate idea where in the film the music was to be. Even after he had shot all the material he continued his search for the ideal film score, wanting a combination of Oriental and Western music. In a conversation with Artemyev he explained that he needed music that reflects the idea that although the East and the West can coexist, they are not able to understand each other. One of Tarkovsky&#x27;s ideas was to perform Western music on Oriental instruments (or vice versa). Artemyev proposed to try this idea with the motet &quot;Pulcherrima Rosa&quot; by an anonymous 14th century Italian composer dedicated to the Virgin Mary.

In its original form Tarkovsky did not perceive the motet as suitable for the film and asked Artemyev to give it an Oriental sound. Later, Tarkovsky proposed to invite musicians from Armenia and Azerbaijan and to let them improvise on the melody of the motet. A musician was invited from Azerbaijan who played the main melody on a tar based on mugham, accompanied by orchestral background music written by Artemyev. Tarkovsky, who, unusually for him, attended the full recording session, rejected the final result as not what he was looking for.

Rethinking their approach, they finally found the solution in a theme that would create a state of inner calmness and inner satisfaction, or as Tarkovsky said &quot;space frozen in a dynamic equilibrium&quot;. Artemyev knew about a musical piece from Indian classical music where a prolonged and unchanged background tone is performed on a tanpura. As this gave Artemyev the impression of frozen space, he used this inspiration and created a background tone on his synthesizer similar to the background tone performed on the tanpura. The tar then improvised on the background sound, together with a flute as a European, Western instrument. To mask the obvious combination of European and Oriental instruments he passed the foreground music through the effect channels of his SYNTHI 100 synthesizer. These effects included modulating the sound of the flute and lowering the speed of the tar, so that what Artemyev called &quot;the life of one string&quot; could be heard. Tarkovsky was amazed by the result, especially liking the sound of the tar, and used the theme without any alterations in the film.

=== Sound design ===
The title sequence is accompanied by Artemyev&#x27;s main theme. The opening sequence of the film showing Stalker&#x27;s room is mostly silent. Periodically one hears what could be a train. The sound becomes louder and clearer over time until the sound and the vibrations of objects in the room give a sense of a train&#x27;s passing by without the train being visible. This aural impression is quickly subverted by the muffled sound of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9. The source of this music is unclear, thus setting the tone for the blurring of reality in the film. For this part of the film Tarkovsky was also considering music by Richard Wagner or the &quot;Marseillaise&quot;.

In an interview with Tonino Guerra in 1979, Tarkovsky said that he wanted: &quot;...music that is more or less popular, that expresses the movement of the masses, the theme of humanity&#x27;s social destiny...But this music must be barely heard beneath the noise, in a way that the spectator is not aware of it.&quot;

The journey into the Zone on a motorized rail car features a disconnection between the visual image and the sound. The presence of the rail car is registered only through the clanking sound of the wheels on the tracks. Neither the rail car nor the scenery passing by is shown, since the camera is focused on the faces of the characters. This disconnection draws the audience into the inner world of the characters and transforms the physical journey into an inner journey. This effect on the audience is reinforced by Artemyev&#x27;s synthesizer effects, which make the clanking wheels sound less and less natural as the journey progresses. When the three arrive in the Zone initially, it appears to be silent. Only after some time, and only slightly audibly can one hear the sound of a distant river, the sound of the blowing wind, or the occasional cry of an animal. These sounds grow richer and more audible while the Stalker makes his first venture into the Zone, as if the sound draws him towards the Zone. The sparseness of sounds in the Zone draws attention to specific sounds, which, as in other scenes, are largely disconnected from the visual image. Animals can be heard in the distance but are never shown. A breeze can be heard, but no visual reference is shown. This effect is reinforced by occasional synthesizer effects which meld with the natural sounds and blur the boundaries between artificial and alien sounds and the sounds of nature.

During the journey in the Zone, the sound of water becomes more and more prominent, which, combined with the visual image, presents the Zone as a drenched world. In an interview Tarkovsky dismissed the idea that water has a symbolic meaning in his films, saying that there was so much rain in his films because it is always raining in Russia. In another interview, on the film &quot;Nostalghia&quot;, however, he said &quot;Water is a mysterious element, a single molecule of which is very photogenic. It can convey movement and a sense of change and flux.&quot; Emerging from the tunnel called the &quot;meat grinder&quot; by the Stalker, they arrive at the entrance of their destination, the room. Here, as in the rest of the film, sound is constantly changing and not necessarily connected to the visual image. The journey in the Zone ends with the three sitting in the room, silent, with no audible sound. When the sound resumes, it is again the sound of water but with a different timbre, softer and gentler, as if to give a sense of catharsis and hope. The transition back to the world outside the Zone is supported by sound. While the camera still shows a pool of water inside the Zone, the audience begins to hear the sound of a train and Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;, reminiscent of the opening scene. The soundscape of the world outside the Zone is the same as before, characterized by train wheels, foghorns of a ship and train whistles. The film ends as it began, with the sound of a train passing by, accompanied by the muffled sound of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9, this time the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; from the final moments of the symphony. As in the rest of the film the disconnect between the visual image and the sound leaves the audience unclear whether the sound is real or an illusion.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Stalker&quot; sold 4.3 million tickets in the Soviet Union.

===Critical response===
Upon its release the film&#x27;s reception was less than favorable. Officials at Goskino, a government group otherwise known as the State Committee for Cinematography, were critical of the film. On being told that &quot;Stalker&quot; should be faster and more dynamic, Tarkovsky replied:

The Goskino representative then stated that he was trying to give the point of view of the audience. Tarkovsky supposedly retorted:
More recently, reviews of the film have been highly positive. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Stalker&quot; is rated at 100% based on 43 reviews with an average rating of 8.6/10. Its critical consensus states, &quot;&quot;Stalker&quot; is a complex, oblique parable that draws unforgettable images and philosophical musings from its sci-fi/thriller setting.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 85 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. It earned a place in the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Films of All Time&quot; poll conducted for &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; in September 2012. The group&#x27;s critics listed &quot;Stalker&quot; at joint #29. Directors ranked it at #30. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Geoff Dyer described the film as &quot;synonymous both with cinema&#x27;s claims to high art and a test of the viewer&#x27;s ability to appreciate it as such&quot;. Critic Derek Adams of the &quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot; has compared &quot;Stalker&quot; to Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, also released in 1979, and argued that &quot;as a journey to the heart of darkness&quot; &quot;Stalker&quot; looks &quot;a good deal more persuasive than Coppola&#x27;s.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; reviewer Nick Schager has praised the film as an &quot;endlessly pliable allegory about human consciousness&quot;.

In 2018, the film was voted the 49th greatest non-English-language film of all time in a poll by BBC Culture involving 209 critics in 43 countries.

===Awards and nominations===
The film was awarded the &quot;Prize of the Ecumenical Jury&quot; at the Cannes Film Festival, and the &quot;Audience Jury Award – Special Mention&quot; at Fantasporto, Portugal.

== Home media ==

* RUSCICO produced a version for the international market containing the film on two DVDs with remastered audio and video. It contains the original Russian audio in an enhanced Dolby Digital 5.1 remix as well as the original mono version. The DVD also contains subtitles in 13 languages and interviews with cameraman Alexander Knyazhinsky, painter and production designer Rashit Safiullin and composer Eduard Artemyev.
* Criterion Collection released a remastered edition DVD and Blu-Ray on 17 July 2017. Included in the special features is an interview with film critic Geoff Dyer, author of the book &quot;&quot;.

However, such notions prompted the author of the &quot;Annihilation&quot; novel, upon which the movie is based, to state that his story &quot;is 100% NOT a tribute to Picnic/Stalker&quot; via his official Twitter account.

=== Literature ===
* In 2012, the English writer Geoff Dyer published &quot;Zona: A Book About a Film About a Journey to a Room&quot; drawing together his personal observations as well as critical insights about the film and the experience of watching it.

=== Video games ===
* In 2007, the Ukrainian video-game developer GSC Game World published &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl&quot;, an open-world, first-person shooter very loosely based on both the film, the original novel, and the real life Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster. While the story in the game differs completely from both the book and the movie, several characters offer parallels to those found in the movie and the book. The game was a critical and commercial success, selling over 15 million copies through 2021 and leading two sequels set in a similar environment.

<text>The Green Party of Canada () is a federal political party in Canada, founded in 1983 with a focus on green politics. 

The Green Party is currently the fifth largest party in the House of Commons by seat count. It elected its first member of Parliament (MP), leader Elizabeth May, in the 2011 election, winning in the Saanich—Gulf Islands. In the 2019 election, the party expanded its caucus to three. In the 2021 election, the party fell to two seats.

Elizabeth May served as the party leader from 2006 to 2019, and again since November 19, 2022. On February 4, 2025, the party ratified a motion to adopt a co-leadership model, with Elizabeth May and Jonathan Pedneault serving together as co-leaders of the party.

The Green Party is founded on six principles, including ecological wisdom, non-violence, social justice, sustainability, participatory democracy, and respect for diversity.

==History==

About two months before the 1980 federal election, eleven candidates, mostly from ridings in the Atlantic provinces, issued a joint press release declaring that they were running on a common platform. It called for a transition to a non-nuclear, conserver society. Although they ran as independents, they unofficially used the name &quot;Small Party&quot; as part of their declaration of unity, a reference to the &quot;small is beautiful&quot; philosophy of E. F. Schumacher. This was the most substantial early attempt to answer the call for an ecologically oriented Canadian political party. A key organizer (and one of the candidates) was Elizabeth May, who later became leader of the Greens in 2006.

The Green Party of Canada was founded at a conference held at Carleton University in Ottawa on November 4, 1983. Under its first leader, Trevor Hancock, the party ran 60 candidates in the 1984 Canadian federal election.

The Quebec wing hosted the 1990 Canadian Greens conference in Montreal. Soon after, Canada&#x27;s constitutional problems interfered; as a result, many Quebec candidates abandoned the Greens in favour of a Quebec sovereigntist party, the Bloc Québécois. There were only six Green candidates from Quebec in the 1993 election. In the spring of 1996, although the hopes of electing a representative to the BC legislature proved premature, Andy Shadrack in the interior of the province received over 11% of the vote. Overall, the party&#x27;s proportion of the popular vote surged to a new high. Shadrack was also the most popular Green candidate in the 1997 federal election, scoring over 6% of the popular vote in West Kootenay—Okanagan.

===Joan Russow years===
British Columbia&#x27;s Joan Russow became leader of the Green Party of Canada on April 13, 1997. Russow won 52% of the ballots cast in the 1997 leadership race, surpassing Ontario&#x27;s Jim Harris (39%) and Rachelle Small (8%). Immediately upon attaining the leadership, Russow was plunged into a federal general election. Russow&#x27;s campaign in 1997 set a number of important precedents. The 1997 federal election was the first campaign in which the Greens conducted a national leader&#x27;s tour, presented a national platform and a bilingual campaign. Previous campaigns, due in part to the party&#x27;s few resources and, in part, to the party&#x27;s constitutional straitjacket, had been characterized by policy and spokespeople operating, at best, province-by-province and, at worst, riding-by-riding. In her own riding of Victoria, Russow received just shy of 3000 votes and 6% of the popular vote.

In 1998, the party adopted a rule that forbids membership in any other federal political party. This was intended to prevent the party from being taken over. A small number of Greens who advocate the more cooperative approach to legislation objected to the rule not to hold cross-memberships, a tool they occasionally employed.

Since its inception, the party has been developing as an organization, expanding its membership and improving its showing at the polls. In the 2000 federal election, the party fielded 111 candidates, up from 78 in 1997.

Candidates were not run in Newfoundland and Labrador, as a result of ongoing divisions over Joan Russow&#x27;s refusal to endorse the Green candidate in an earlier St. John&#x27;s West by-election. (The candidate in question supported the seal hunt and mining development, as most locals did.) This caused much uncertainty and friction between Newfoundland&#x27;s Terra Nova Green Party Association and the Green Party leader as the party gradually adapted to the realities of functioning as a true national party rather than a disorganized federation of local activists.

The conflicts left Russow isolated and alienated from most members of the party. Volunteer efforts were substantially absorbed in provincial campaigns between 2001 and 2003, and the federal party became dormant between elections, as was typical in the past. Chris Bradshaw served the party as interim leader from 2001 to February 2003. During his term, the party ended its sharing of office and staff with the Ontario party, establishing its own office in the national capital of Ottawa.

Russow left the party in 2001 and later criticized the Green Party for not following their policies. She re-joined the party in 2020 to support Dimitri Lascaris&#x27; campaign for the Green Party leadership.

===Breakthrough under Jim Harris===
In February 2003, Jim Harris, in his second bid for the leadership, defeated John Grogan of Valemount, British Columbia, and Jason Crummey. Crummey was originally from Newfoundland and involved with Newfoundland and Labrador Terra Nova Greens.

During the 2004 federal election, the Green Party of Canada became the fourth federal political party ever to run candidates in all the ridings. When the ballots were counted, the Green Party secured 4.3% of the popular vote, thereby surpassing the 2% threshold required for party financing under new Elections Canada rules.

Momentum continued to build around the Green Party of Canada and in the 2006 federal election the Green Party again ran 308 candidates and increased its share of the popular vote to 4.5%, once again securing federal financing as a result.

The party&#x27;s 2006 election campaign was disrupted by allegations made by Matthew Pollesell, the party&#x27;s former assistant national organizer, that Harris had not filed a proper accounting of money spent during his 2004 leadership campaign, as required by law. Pollesell issued a request that Elections Canada investigate. Pollesell and another former party member, Gretchen Schwarz, were subsequently warned by the party&#x27;s legal counsel to retract allegations they had made or face a possible legal action. Dana Miller, who served in the party&#x27;s shadow cabinet with responsibility for human-rights issues, made public her earlier complaints that the party has violated election law and its own constitution and has also asked for an Elections Canada investigation. Miller had been expelled from the party after filing a complaint within the party in April.

Some opponents of Harris&#x27;s leadership of the Green Party formed the rival Peace and Ecology Party, which presumably disbanded after he stepped down as leader.

===Arrival of Elizabeth May===
A leadership vote was held at the party&#x27;s August 2006 convention. On April 24, 2006, Jim Harris announced his intention not to stand for re-election as party leader. Three candidates officially entered the leadership race: David Chernushenko, Elizabeth May, and Jim Fannon. May won the leadership with 65% of the vote on the first ballot.

On October 22, 2006, Elizabeth May announced she would run in the federal by-election to be held on November 27, 2006, in London North Centre, Ontario. She finished second behind the Liberal candidate, but garnered 26% of the popular vote.

Even though it had never held a seat, Elizabeth May&#x27;s Green Party began to receive more mainstream media attention on other party policy not directly related to the environment – for example, supporting labour rights and poppy legalization in Afghanistan.

On August 30, 2008, Vancouver area MP Blair Wilson became the first-ever Green member of Parliament, after sitting for nearly a year of the 39th Canadian Parliament as an independent. He had been a Liberal MP but stepped down voluntarily from the caucus earlier in the Parliament after anonymous allegations of campaign finance irregularities, most of which he was later cleared after a 9-month investigation by Elections Canada. Wilson had joined the Green Party during Parliament&#x27;s summer recess and never sat in the House of Commons as a Green MP.

After initial opposition from three of the four major political parties, May was invited to the leaders&#x27; debates; this was a first for the party. In the 2008 federal election, the party increased its share of the popular vote by 2.33% (to 6.80%), being the only federally funded party to increase its total vote tally over 2006, attracting nearly 280,000 new votes. However, the party failed to elect a candidate. Some prominent Green Party members blamed the public discussion of strategic voting and the media&#x27;s misrepresentation of May&#x27;s comments during the election campaign for the failure of some promising candidates to reach Election Canada&#x27;s 10% reimbursement threshold, as well as reducing the party&#x27;s federal funding based on popular vote.

On August 11, 2010, 74% of Green Party members voted to hold a leadership review after the next election, instead of in August 2010, which was when May&#x27;s four-year term as leader was set to end.

=== Greens in Parliament ===
On May 2, 2011, May became the first elected Green Party MP to sit in the House of Commons. She won the riding of Saanich—Gulf Islands in coastal British Columbia. In winning her seat, May also became one of the few Greens worldwide to be elected in a federal, single-seat election. On 13 December 2013, Thunder Bay—Superior North MP Bruce Hyer, who had left the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 2012 to sit as an independent after breaking party lines to vote in favour of a repeal of the Long Gun Registry, joined the party, resulting in a record two-member caucus in Parliament.
In August 2014, party president-elect Paul Estrin published a blog post on the Green Party&#x27;s website criticizing the actions of Hamas during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. In his article, &quot;Why Gaza Makes Me Sad&quot;, Estrin talked about Hamas&#x27; &quot;desire to obliterate&quot; the State of Israel and how the terrorist group uses children as human shields. Estrin&#x27;s blog post was subsequently deleted by the party, with many party seniors and decision makers, including Elizabeth May, distancing themselves from Estrin, with a large majority of the party calling on him to resign. On August 5, Estrin resigned, criticizing the party for betraying their commitment to values of inclusivity and open public discourse. Elizabeth May accepted the resignation of Estrin, stating that he was not forced to resign, but did so of his own volition. May has said that the problem with his statements were the &quot;confusion&quot; they caused because they differed from party lines, but confirmed that Estrin was indeed a &quot;true Green&quot;.

In the lead up to the federal election on October 19, 2015, José Núñez-Melo joined the Green Party. Núñez-Melo, first elected in 2011 as a New Democrat in the riding of Laval, was barred by the NDP from seeking re-nomination after he publicly criticized the nomination process; after the dropping of the writ, Núñez-Melo announced he would run for re-election in Vimy as a Green Party candidate. As Parliament was dissolved for the election at the time of Núñez-Melo&#x27;s change in affiliation, he was never formally recorded as a Green MP. Ultimately, May was re-elected in the riding of Saanich—Gulf Islands while both Hyer and Núñez-Melo were defeated, leaving May as the only member in the House.

In March 2018, Green Party leader Elizabeth May appointed journalist and broadcaster Jo-Ann Roberts as a deputy leader along with environmentalist Daniel Green of Montreal. Roberts ran as Green Party candidate in a Victoria, British Columbia, riding during the 2015 federal election and finished second.

On May 6, 2019, Paul Manly became the second MP elected under the party&#x27;s banner, after winning a by-election in Nanaimo—Ladysmith. On 19 August 2019, a former NDP and briefly Independent MP Pierre Nantel joined the Green Party during the Parliament&#x27;s summer recess.

During the 2019 federal election, both May and Manly were re-elected while Jenica Atwin was elected in her New Brunswick riding of Fredericton, making her the third elected Green MP in the federal parliament, and the first Green MP outside of British Columbia.

During the 2021 federal election, Mike Morrice was elected in Kitchener Centre, becoming the first Green MP elected in Ontario, and second Green MP outside of British Columbia, as well the former leader May was re-elected. However, Manly was defeated in Nanaimo—Ladysmith. In addition, Atwin won re-election as a Liberal candidate.

=== Division under Annamie Paul ===

On November 4, 2019, May announced she would be stepping down as leader of the Green Party of Canada. May continued to act as parliamentary leader and sit as a Green member of Parliament. The decision to step down came as a promise to May&#x27;s daughter. A leadership election was held on 3 October 2020, and Toronto-based lawyer and activist Annamie Paul was elected to succeed Elizabeth May as Green Party leader. At the time, Annamie Paul had been described as a centrist.

Paul ran in the 2020 Toronto Centre federal by-election, where she placed second.

On June 10, 2021, Jenica Atwin crossed the floor, leaving the Green caucus to join the Liberal caucus. This came shortly after a public rift over the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Atwin had criticized party leader Paul&#x27;s statement on the matter following Israeli airstrikes as &quot;inadequate&quot;, which in turn prompted an advisor to Paul, Noah Zatzman, to vow to replace Atwin with a &quot;Zionist&quot; candidate. In a Facebook post, Zatzman stated: &quot;We will work to defeat you and bring in progressive climate champions who are antifa and pro LGBT and pro indigenous sovereignty and Zionists!!!!!” Atwin cited &quot;distractions&quot; in the Green Party as a factor in her departure. The Green federal council subsequently passed a motion calling for Paul to repudiate Zatzman for his statements towards Atwin and other Green MPs, of which Paul refused to act on. Following Atwin&#x27;s defection, the remaining two Green MPs, Elizabeth May and Paul Manly, reaffirmed their commitment to their party and expressed their disappointment, stating &quot;the attack against Ms. Atwin by the Green party leader&#x27;s chief spokesperson on May 14 created the conditions that led to this crisis&quot;.

In the 2021 election, the party&#x27;s share of the vote fell to its lowest amount in 21 years. As well, the Green Party ran candidates in only 252 of the country&#x27;s 338 ridings; limited resources and staff layoffs hampered any attempt at a co-ordinated countrywide campaign, which also lacked a national director during all five weeks of election campaigning. A week after the election, Paul announced her intention to resign as leader.

According to reporting by &quot;The Tyee&quot;, Paul confronted the federal council following her statement to intend to resign. She allegedly asked the council “How many of you think I resigned today?” and following her statement with &quot;Well, I didn&#x27;t. I just started the process of my resignation.&quot; Paul allegedly told Elizabeth May &quot;not to talk to the media&quot; regarding her exit, but May ignored her request and stated that Paul was &quot;creating chaos&quot;. May, talking with &quot;The Tyee&quot;, stated that Paul was resistant to leave the building, and continued to control the party&#x27;s communications. She cited an instance of an associate of Paul blocking Lorraine Rekmans, an Indigenous woman, from making a statement regarding the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, and writing a statement instead. An internal report of the Green Party obtained by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; stated: &quot;there is systemic racism at the governance level of the party, which needs to be, but is not being, addressed&quot;. Former leader Jim Harris was critical of Paul&#x27;s statements on her experiences of racism within the Green Party and dismissed the existence of issues of systemic racism within the party, stating: &quot;When she doesn&#x27;t get her way, she calls racism. Now, racism, sexism, and violent metaphors like &#x27;walking over shards of glass&#x27; and &#x27;spitting up blood&#x27; get headlines, but what we have to judge a leader by is their performance.&quot; A member of the Greens&#x27; federal council, Louise Comeau, stepped down following the internal turmoil, citing &quot;[the] stress and anxiety of those meetings affected [her] physical and mental health&quot;, with regards to negotiations surrounding Paul&#x27;s departure. May theorized Paul wished to negotiate a severance package before her departure as Green leader.

On October 28, 2021, Green members received a leadership review ballot regarding Paul&#x27;s continued status as leader. Several days later, Paul told a press conference she was surprised by the review, and that it was unnecessary since she had previously announced her intention to resign. Paul&#x27;s protracted departure was due to continued legal conflict between Paul and the Green Party&#x27;s leadership, with Paul negotiating compensation for legal fees incurred due to arbitration following a previous attempt to remove Paul as leader. Paul officially resigned on November 10, 2021, as voting in the review was ongoing.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC11/10&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her resignation took effect on November 14, 2021, upon its acceptance by the party&#x27;s federal council.

===Rebuilding===
On November 24, 2021, Amita Kuttner was appointed interim leader. Appointed at the age of 30, Kuttner was the youngest person to lead a federal political party, as well as the first transgender person and person of East Asian heritage.

The party&#x27;s constitution required a leadership election to select a permanent leader to begin within six months of the appointment of an interim leader, and conclude within two years of their appointment. Kuttner had said that they did not wish to be the permanent leader. In December 2021, Kuttner said that they believed there should be a &quot;longer period before launching a permanent leadership contest, and then a short leadership race.&quot;

In a press conference about a week after their appointment, Kuttner said they wanted to start the process of regrowth and to heal the party. The party had released a report indicating that it was threatened with insolvency, and was considering closing its office in Ottawa. The party had lost 499 monthly donors since July 2021, and 6,259 members in the same time. Kuttner acknowledged internal conflict over Annamie Paul&#x27;s leadership had affected donations. The report also blamed negotiations concerning Annamie Paul&#x27;s departure as leader of the party for significant legal costs. In a December 2021 media interview, Kuttner said that the party&#x27;s financial position was getting &quot;back on track&quot; and was &quot;turning around&quot; pointing to fundraising including at the party&#x27;s virtual general meeting about a week earlier.

On September 11, 2022, the president of the party, Lorraine Rekmans, announced her resignation. She was very critical of the party and the candidates in the ongoing leadership race, stating &quot;The dream is dead.&quot; She was succeeded as party president by Ian Soutar.

===Return of Elizabeth May and co-leadership ===

On November 19, 2022, Elizabeth May was elected leader of the party once again, promising to convert the current leadership model into a co-leadership model, with Jonathan Pedneault being her co-leader. May ran with Pedneault in the leadership race, and Pedneault served as the deputy leader of the party. In February 2024, party members were to vote on motions which, if passed, would have amended the party&#x27;s constitution to implement a co-leadership model. However, Pedneault was unsuccessful in his attempt to win a seat in the House of Commons through a byelection and the proposed constitutional amendment was not voted upon due to disagreement within the party. On July 9, 2024, Jonathan Pedneault resigned as deputy leader, citing personal reasons. He returned in January 2025 to serve as co-leader, pending election by party membership, which was approved on February 4, 2025. The party unveiled its new logo on February 18, its first rebrand in 25 years.

==Principles and policies==

===Political position===
The Green Party officially rejects the traditional left–right political spectrum, describing it as &quot;something of an anachronism&quot;. Instead, the Green Party believes that &quot;voters in modern democracies [are] divided on lines … more to do with &#x27;insiders&#x27; and &#x27;outsiders.&#x27;&quot; According to co-founder and former leader Trevor Hancock, &quot;the perennial left vs. right squabbling about who gets to control and benefit from the ever-expanding pie is to completely miss the point; the pie cannot continue to expand, indeed it must contract … the struggle for social justice is deeply rooted in the fact that the limits to growth requires a radical global and societal redistribution of the Earth’s limited resources.&quot; In 2019, the Green Party under Elizabeth May ran on a campaign slogan of &quot;Not Left. Not Right. Forward Together.&quot;

The party is noted as having a wide range of internal factions; the 2020 leadership election saw both self-described moderate and eco-socialist candidates. Writing in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, Anne Kingston described the party as an &quot;ideological hybrid&quot;, combining left-leaning views on social issues and welfare with a right-leaning embrace of market solutions and tax shifting; in another article, Matt Gurney concurred with that description, but also said that &quot;in practice&quot; the Greens are &quot;simply another centre-left party&quot;. Other political commentators, such as Andrew Coyne, Chantal Hébert and Heather Mallick, identify the party as being on the left.

===Principles===
The Green Party of Canada is founded on six key principles that were adopted at the 2002 convention of the Global Greens. These principles are:
* Ecological wisdom
* Non-violence
* Social justice
* Sustainability
* Participatory democracy
* Respect for diversity

==Leadership==

===Party parliamentary leaders ===
The position of parliamentary leader was created on 4 November 2019, when then-leader Elizabeth May announced that she was resigning as leader of the party, but would remain leader of the parliamentary caucus. The position ceased to exist after May re-assumed the party leadership in 2022.

==Provincial and territorial parties==

Nine provinces and one territory have an active Green party. While these parties and the Green Party of Canada share values and often supporters, they operate as independent entities and do not have common membership.

Currently, nine Green legislators sit in provincial legislative assemblies, including three in Prince Edward Island, two in British Columbia, three in New Brunswick, and two in Ontario. The Greens in Prince Edward Island were the first Green party to form the official opposition in any provincial assembly.

The only province without a Green party is Newfoundland and Labrador. An association called the Terra Nova Greens, created in 1996, was previously the Green Party of Canada&#x27;s &quot;official unit&quot; for the province. TNG was never a registered party, but fielded independent candidates in three provincial general elections. They remained the federal party&#x27;s &quot;official unit&quot; until 2007, but most supporters cut ties to the national party in 2006 (or earlier) over its opposition to the traditional Newfoundland seal hunt. As of 2021, there are ongoing efforts to establish a provincial green party in Newfoundland and Labrador.

Nunavut and the Northwest Territories have legislatures that use non-partisan consensus government. As such, there are no registered green parties (or any other parties) in these territories. However, one member of the Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly was known to be a member of the federal Green Party: Rylund Johnson of Yellowknife North.

<doc id="286275" wikidata="Q8063246" url="?curid=286275" title="ZOG (hypertext)">
<text>ZOG was an early hypertext system developed at Carnegie Mellon University during the 1970s by Donald McCracken and Robert Akscyn. ZOG was first developed by Allen Newell and George G. Robertson to serve as the front end for AI and Cognitive Science programs brought together at CMU for a summer workshop. The ZOG project was as an outgrowth of long-term artificial intelligence research led by Allen Newell and funded by the Office of Naval Research. A second version of ZOG was installed as the key interface between users and logistics on the Nimitz class carrier USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; in 1983.

==Composition==
ZOG consisted of &quot;frames&quot; that contained a title, a description, a line containing ZOG system commands, and selections (menu items) that led to other frames. ZOG pioneered the &quot;frame&quot; or &quot;card&quot; model of hypertext later popularized by HyperCard. In such systems, the frames or cards cannot scroll to show content that is part of the same document but held offscreen. Instead, text that exceeds the capacity of one screen &quot;must&quot; be placed in another (which then constitutes a separate frame or card)

The ZOG database became fully functional around 1977. Beginning in 1980, ZOG was ported from DEC VAX version (written in an experimental language called &quot;L*&quot;) to the Pascal-based Three Rivers PERQ workstation and was used for a shipwide local area network on the American aircraft carrier &quot;USS Carl Vinson&quot;. In 1981, Rob Akscyn and Donald McCracken, two principals from the ZOG project, founded Knowledge Systems to develop and market a commercial follow-on to ZOG called KMS (&quot;Knowledge Management System&quot;).

<doc id="286278" wikidata="Q171927" url="?curid=286278" title="Pygmy peoples">
<text>In anthropology, pygmy peoples are ethnic groups whose average height is unusually short. The term pygmyism is used to describe the phenotype of endemic short stature (as opposed to disproportionate dwarfism occurring in isolated cases in a population) for populations in which adult men are on average less than tall.

Although the term is sometimes considered derogatory because it focuses on a physical trait, it remains the primary term associated with the African Pygmies, the hunter-gatherers of the Congo Basin (comprising the Bambenga, Bambuti and Batwa). The terms &quot;Asiatic pygmies&quot; and &quot;Oceanic pygmies&quot; have also been used to describe the Negrito populations of Southeast Asia and Australo-Melanesian peoples of short stature. The Taron people of Myanmar are an exceptional case of a pygmy population of East Asian phenotype.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;pygmy&quot;, as used to refer to diminutive people, comes via Latin from Greek πυγμαῖος &quot;pygmaîos&quot;, derived from πυγμή &quot;pygmḗ&quot;, meaning &quot;short cubit&quot;, or a measure of length corresponding to the distance from the elbow to the first knuckle of the middle finger, meant to express pygmies&#x27; diminutive stature.

In Greek mythology and classical natural history, the word denoted a tribe of diminutive people first described by the ancient Greek poet Homer, and reputed to live to the south of modern-day Ethiopia or in India. For example, Aristotle described them thus in his &quot;History of Animals&quot; (while discussing cranes that migrate south of Egypt): &quot;The story is not fabulous, but there is in reality a race of dwarfish men, and the horses are little in proportion, and the men live in caves underground.&quot;

Many African pygmies prefer to be identified by their ethnicity, such as the Aka (Mbenga), Baka, Mbuti, and Twa. The term &quot;Bayaka&quot;, the plural form of the Aka/Yaka, is sometimes used in the Central African Republic to refer to all local pygmies. Likewise, the Kongo word &quot;Bambenga&quot; is used in Congo. In other parts of Africa, they are called &quot;Wochua&quot; or &quot;Achua&quot;. In French-speaking Africa, they are sometimes referred to adjectivally as autochthon (&quot;autochtone&quot;), meaning &quot;native&quot; or &quot;indigenous&quot;.

== Short stature ==

Various theories have been proposed to explain the short stature of pygmies. Some studies suggest that it could be related to adaptation to low ultraviolet light levels in rainforests. This might mean that relatively little vitamin D can be made in human skin, thereby limiting calcium uptake from the diet for bone growth and maintenance and leading to the evolution of the small skeletal size.

Other explanations include lack of food in the rainforest environment, low calcium levels in the soil, the need to move through dense jungle, adaptation to heat and humidity, and as an association with rapid reproductive maturation under conditions of early mortality. Other evidence points towards unusually low levels of expression of the genes encoding the growth hormone receptor and growth hormone compared to the related tribal groups, associated with low serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 and short stature.

== Africa ==

African Pygmies live in several ethnic groups in Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo (ROC), Central African Republic, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Madagascar, and Zambia. There are at least a dozen pygmy groups, sometimes unrelated to each other. The best known are the Mbenga (Aka and Baka) of the western Congo Basin, who speak Bantu and Ubangian languages; the Mbuti (Efe &quot;etc.&quot;) of the Ituri Rainforest, who speak Bantu and Central Sudanic languages, and the Twa of the African Great Lakes, who speak Bantu Rundi and Kiga. Most pygmy communities are partially hunter-gatherers, living partially but not exclusively on the wild products of their environment. They trade with neighbouring farmers to acquire cultivated foods and other material items; no group lives deep in the forest without access to agricultural products. It is estimated that there are between 250,000 and 600,000 Pygmies living in the Congo rainforest. However, although Pygmies are thought of as forest people, the groups called Twa may live in open swamp or desert.

=== Origins ===
Expansion to Central Africa by the ancestors of African Pygmies most likely took place before 130,000 years ago, and certainly before 60,000 years ago. A commonly held belief is that African Pygmies are the direct descendants of Late Stone Age hunter-gatherer peoples of the central African rainforest, who were partially absorbed or displaced by later immigration of agricultural peoples, and adopted their Central Sudanic, Ubangian, and Bantu languages. This view has no archaeological support and ambiguous support from genetics and linguistics.

Some 30% of Aka language is not Bantu, and a similar percentage of Baka language is not Ubangian. Much of pygmy vocabulary is botanical, dealing with honey collecting, or is otherwise specialized for the forest and is shared between the two western pygmy groups. It has been proposed that this is the remnant of an independent western pygmy (Mbenga or &quot;Baaka&quot;) language. However, this type of vocabulary is subject to widespread borrowing among the Pygmies and neighboring peoples, and the &quot;Baaka&quot; language was only reconstructed to the 15th century.

African Pygmy populations are genetically diverse and extremely divergent from all other human populations, suggesting they have an ancient indigenous lineage. Their uniparental markers represent the second-most ancient divergence, after those typically found in Khoisan peoples. Recent advances in genetics shed some light on the origins of the various Pygmy groups. Researchers found &quot;an early divergence of the ancestors of Pygmy hunter–gatherers and farming populations 60,000 years ago, followed by a split of the Pygmies&#x27; ancestors into the Western and Eastern pygmy groups 20,000 years ago.&quot;

New evidence suggests East and West African Pygmy children have different growth patterns. The difference between the two groups may indicate the Pygmies&#x27; short stature did not start with their common ancestor but instead evolved independently in adapting to similar environments, which adds support that some sets of genes related to height were advantageous in Eastern Pygmy populations, but not in Western Pygmy populations.

However, Roger Blench argues that the Pygmies are not descended from residual hunter-gatherer groups but rather are offshoots of larger neighboring ethnolinguistic groups that had adopted forest subsistence strategies. Blench notes the lack of clear linguistic and archaeological evidence for the antiquity of pygmy cultures and peoples and also notes that the genetic evidence can be problematic. Blench also notes that there is no evidence of the Pygmies have hunting technology distinctive from that of their neighbors, and argues that the short stature of pygmy populations can arise relatively quickly (in less than a few millennia) due to strong selection pressures.

=== Culture ===
The African Pygmies are particularly known for their usually vocal music, usually characterised by dense contrapuntal communal improvisation. Simha Arom says that the level of polyphonic complexity of pygmy music was reached in Europe in the 14th century, yet Pygmy culture is unwritten and ancient. Music permeates daily life and there are songs for entertainment as well as specific events and activities.

=== Violence against pygmies ===
==== Reported genocides ====

The pygmy population was a target of the Interahamwe during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Of the 30,000 Pygmies in Rwanda, an estimated 10,000 were killed and another 10,000 were displaced. They have been described as &quot;forgotten victims&quot; of the genocide.

From the end of 2002 through January 2003 around 60,000 Pygmy civilians and 10,000 combatants were killed and often cannibalized in an extermination campaign known as &quot;Effacer le tableau&quot; during the Second Congo War. Human rights activists have made demands for the massacre to be recognized as genocide.

===== Forced removal =====

In a strategy described as fortress conservation, the conservation efforts of national parks, often financed by international organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund, can involve heavily armed park rangers removing native pygmies off the land. However, some have argued that the most efficient conservation methods involve giving land rights to the land&#x27;s indigenous inhabitants. This pattern of eviction has been seen in national parks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, such as Kahuzi-Biéga National Park, where pygmy inhabitants often cut the trees down to sell charcoal. In the Republic of the Congo, this is seen in the Messok Dja protected area. In Cameroon, this is seen in the Lobéké National Park. In Uganda, some Batwa have been removed from land reclassified as national parks, such as the Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, which is home to the endangered mountain gorilla. 

==== Reported slavery ====
In the Republic of the Congo, where Pygmies make up 2% of the population, many Pygmies live as slaves to Bantu masters. The nation is deeply stratified between these two major ethnic groups. The Pygmy slaves belong to their Bantu masters from birth in a relationship that the Bantus call a time-honored tradition. A 2007 news report stated that even though Pygmies are responsible for much of the hunting, fishing and manual labor in jungle villages, &quot;Pygmies and Bantus alike say that Pygmies are often paid at the master&#x27;s whim: in cigarettes, used clothing, or even nothing at all.&quot; As a result of pressure from UNICEF and human-rights activists, in 2009, a law that would grant special protections to the Pygmy people was awaiting a vote by the Congo parliament. According to reports made in 2013, this law was never passed.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, during the Ituri conflict, Ugandan-backed rebel groups were accused by the UN of enslaving Mbutis to prospect for minerals and forage for forest food, with those returning empty handed being killed and eaten.

==== Ethnic conflict ====

In Northern Katanga Province starting in 2013, the Pygmy Batwa people, whom the Luba people often exploit and allegedly enslave, rose up into militias, such as the &quot;Perci&quot; militia, and attacked Luba villages. A Luba militia known as &quot;Elements&quot; counterattacked. More than a thousand people were killed in the first eight months of 2014 alone with the number of displaced people estimated to be 650,000 as of December 2017. The weapons used in the conflict are often arrows and axes, rather than guns.

==== Discrimination ====

Historically, the pygmy have always been viewed as inferior by both colonial authorities and the village-dwelling Bantu tribes. Pygmy children were sometimes captured during the period of the Congo Free State, which exported Pygmy children to zoos throughout Europe, including the world&#x27;s fair in the United States in 1907. Pygmies are often evicted from their land and given the lowest paying jobs. At a state level, Pygmies are sometimes not considered citizens and are refused identity cards, deeds to land, health care and proper schooling. &quot;The Lancet&quot; published a review showing that Pygmy populations often had worse access to health care than neighboring communities.

== Asia and Pacific ==

=== Southeast Asia ===

Negritos in Southeast Asia (including the Batak and Aeta of the Philippines, the Andamanese of the Andaman Islands, and the Semang of the Malay Peninsula) are sometimes called pygmies (especially in older literature). Negritos share some common physical features with African pygmy populations, including short stature and dark skin. The name &quot;Negrito&quot;, from the Spanish adjective meaning &quot;small black person&quot;, was given by early explorers. The explorers who named the Negritos assumed the Andamanese they encountered were from Africa. This belief was, however, discarded by anthropologists who noted that apart from dark skin, peppercorn hair, and steatopygia, the Andamanese had little in common with any African population, including the African pygmies. Their superficial resemblance to some Africans and Melanesians is thought to be from living in a similar environment, or simply retentions of the initial human form.

Their origin and the route of their migration to Asia is a matter of great speculation. They are genetically distant from Africans and have been shown to have separated early from Asians, suggesting that they are either surviving descendants of settlers from the early out-of-Africa migration of the Great Coastal Migration of the Proto-Australoids, or that they are descendants of one of the founder populations of modern humans.

Frank Kingdon-Ward in the early 20th century reported a tribe of pygmy Tibeto-Burman speakers known as the Taron inhabiting the remote region of Mt. Hkakabo Razi in Southeast Asia on the border of China (Yunnan and Tibet), Burma, and India. A Burmese survey done in the 1960s reported a mean height of an adult male Taron at and that of females at . These are the only known &quot;pygmies&quot; of clearly East Asian descent.

The cause of their diminutive size is unknown, but diet and endogamous marriage practices have been cited. The population of Taron pygmies has been steadily shrinking and is now down to only a few individuals. In 2013, a link between the Taron and the Derung people in Yunnan, China, was uncovered by Richard D. Fisher, which may indicate the presence of pygmy populations among the Derung tribe.

=== Disputed pygmy presence in Australia ===
Australian anthropologist Norman Tindale and American anthropologist Joseph Birdsell suggested there were 12 Negrito-like tribes of short-statured Aboriginal peoples living on the coastal and rainforest areas around Cairns on the lands of the Mbabaram people and Djabugay people. Birdsell found that the average adult male height of Aboriginal people in this region was significantly less than that of other Aboriginal Australian groups; however, it was still greater than the maximum height for classification as a pygmy people, so the term &quot;pygmy&quot; may be considered a misnomer. He called this short-statured group &quot;Barrineans&quot;, after Lake Barrine.

Birdsell classified Aboriginal Australians into three major groups, mixed together to varying degrees: the Carpentarians, best represented in Arnhem Land; the Murrayans, centred in southeastern Australia; and the Barrineans. He argued that people related to Oceanic Negritos were the first arrivals, and had been absorbed or replaced over time by later incoming peoples; the present-day Barrineans retained the greatest proportion of ancestry from this original Negrito group, &quot;[b]ut this is not to say that the Barrineans are Negritos ... the Negritic component is clearly subordinate, and ... the preponderant element is Murrayian.&quot; This trihybrid model is generally considered defunct today; craniometric, genetic, and linguistic evidence does not support a separate origin of Barrinean or other Aboriginal groups, and physical differences between Aboriginal groups can be explained by adaptation to differing environments.

In 2002, the purported existence of short-statured people in Queensland was brought into the public eye by Keith Windschuttle and Tim Gillin in an article published by the right-wing Quadrant magazine (edited by Windschuttle himself). The authors argued that these people were evidence for a distinct Negrito population in support of Birdsell&#x27;s theory, and claimed that &quot;the fact that the Australian pygmies have been so thoroughly expunged from public memory suggests an indecent concurrence between scholarly and political interests&quot;, because evidence of descent from earlier or later waves of origin could lead to conflicting claims of priority by Aboriginal people and hence pose a threat to political co-operation among them. This and other publications promoting the trihybrid model drew several responses, which went over the current scientific evidence against the theory, and suggested that attempts to revive the theory were motivated by an agenda of undermining Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander claims to native title.

Some Aboriginal oral histories and oral traditions from Queensland tell of &quot;little red men&quot;. In 1957 a member of the Jinibara (the Dalla people) tribe of SE Queensland, Gaiarbau, who was born in 1873 and had lived for many years traditionally with his tribe, said that he knew of the &quot;existence of these &quot;little people – the Dinderi&quot;, also known as &quot;Dimbilum&quot;, &quot;Danagalalangur&quot; and &quot;Kandju&quot;. Gaiarbau claims he saw members of a &quot;tribe of small people ... and said they were like dwarfs ... and ... not ... any of them stood five feet [1.5m].&quot; The Dinderi are also recorded in other stories, such as one concerning a platypus myth and another, &quot;The Dinderi and Gujum - The Legend of the Stones of the Mary River&quot;.

Susan McIntyre-Tamwoy, archaeologist and adjunct professor at James Cook University, has written of the northern Cape York Aboriginal people&#x27;s belief of the &quot;bipotaim&quot;, which is when &quot;the landscape as we know it today was created&quot;. &quot;Bipotaim&quot; was formed &quot;before people, although not perhaps before the short people or the red devils as these were also here before people&quot;. She writes, &quot;many ethnographers recorded stories of &#x27;short people&#x27; or what they referred to as &#x27;pygmy tribes, such as Lindsey Page Winterbotham. She used information collected both through oral accounts (including those of Injinoo people), observation and archival research. McIntyre-Tamwoy recounts a &quot;bipotaim&quot; story: &quot;We are the short people [pygmies?]. Red devils occupy parts of the adjacent stony coast but our home is here in the sand dunes and forest. Before the Marakai [&#x27;white people&#x27;] came to our land the people were plentiful and they roamed the land. They understood the land and called out in the language of the country to seek permission, as they should ...&quot;.

According to Nathan Sentance, a librarian from the indigenous Wiradjuri nation employed by the Australian National Museum, there is no known archaeological or biological evidence such a people existed. Sentance claims it is a myth used to justify the colonisation of Australia as well as other countries by Europeans.

=== Micronesia and Melanesia ===
Norman Gabel mentions that rumours exist of pygmy people in the interior mountains of Viti Levu in Fiji, but explains he had no evidence of their existence as of 2012.
E. W. Gifford reiterated Gabel&#x27;s statement in 2014 and claims that tribes of pygmies in the closest proximity to Fiji would most likely be found in Vanuatu.

In 2008, the remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were found on the islands of Palau in Micronesia.

During the 1900s, when Vanuatu was known as New Hebrides, sizable pygmy tribes were first reported throughout northeastern Santo. It is likely that they are not limited to this region of New Hebrides. Nonetheless, there is no anthropological evidence linking pygmies to other islands of Vanuatu.

== Archaic humans ==
The extinct archaic human species &quot;Homo luzonensis&quot; has been classified as a pygmy group. The remains used to identify &quot;Homo luzonensis&quot; were discovered in Luzon, the Philippines, in 2007, and were designated as a species in 2019. &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot;, another archaic human from the island of Flores in Indonesia, stood around tall. The pygmy phenotype evolved as a result of island syndrome which, amongst other things, results in reduced body size in insular humans.

<text>The Seveso disaster was an industrial accident that occurred around 12:37 pm on 10 July 1976, in a small chemical manufacturing plant approximately north of Milan in the Lombardy region of Italy. It resulted in the highest known exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in residential populations, which gave rise to numerous scientific studies and standardized industrial safety regulations, including the European Union&#x27;s Seveso III Directive. This accident was ranked eighth in a list of the worst man-made environmental disasters by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2010.

==Location of disaster==
The Seveso disaster was named after Seveso, the community most affected, which had a population of 17,000 in 1976. Other affected neighbouring communities were Meda (19,000), Desio (33,000), Cesano Maderno (34,000) and to a lesser extent Barlassina (6,000) and Bovisio-Masciago (11,000). The industrial plant, located in Meda, was owned by the company (Meda Chemical Industries S.A., or ICMESA), a subsidiary of Givaudan, which in turn was a subsidiary of Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche Group). The factory building had been built many years earlier and the local population did not perceive it as a potential source of danger. Moreover, although several exposures of populations to dioxins had occurred before, mostly in industrial accidents, they were of a more limited scale.

==Chemical events==
The accident occurred in the chemical plant&#x27;s Building B. The chemical 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (&quot;2&quot;) was being produced there from 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene (&quot;1&quot;) by the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction with sodium hydroxide. The 2,4,5-trichlorophenol was intended as an intermediate for hexachlorophene.

Reaction temperature was achieved by passing the steam exhaust from the onsite electricity generation turbine through an external heating coil installed on the chemical reactor vessel. The exhaust steam pressure was normally 12 bar and temperature 190 °C, which resulted in a reaction mixture temperature of 158 °C, very close to its boiling point of 160 °C. Safety testing showed the onset of an exothermic (heat-releasing) side reaction if the reaction mixture temperature reached 230 °C. Crucially, no steam temperature reading was made available to plant operators responsible for the reactor.

The chemical-release accident occurred when a batch process was stopped prior to the completion of the final step of removal of ethylene glycol from the reaction mixture by distillation. The process was stopped due to conformance with an Italian law requiring shutdown of plant operations over the weekend. Other parts of the site had already started to close down as the processing of other batches finished, which reduced power consumption across the plant, causing a dramatic drop in the load on the turbine and a consequent increase in the temperature of the exhaust steam to around 300 °C. This hotter than normal steam then heated the portion of the metal wall of the accident reactor above the level of the liquid within it to the same temperature. Not having a steam temperature reading among their instruments, operators of the reactor were unaware of the presence of this additional heating, and they stopped the batch as they normally would by isolating the steam and turning off the stirrer in the reactor vessel. The abnormally hot upper region of the reactor jacket then heated the adjacent reaction mixture. With the stirrer not running, the heating was highly localised to just the portion of the upper layers of reaction mixture adjacent to the reactor wall. The local temperature increased to above the critical temperature for the exothermic side reaction seen in testing. Additionally, the critical temperature proved to be only 180 °C, 50 °C lower than believed. At that lower critical temperature, an exothermic decomposition began, releasing more heat and leading to the onset of a rapid runaway reaction when the temperature reached 230 °C seven hours later.

The reactor relief valve eventually opened, causing the aerial release of 6 tonnes of chemicals, which settled over of the surrounding area. The cloud of substances released contained sodium hydroxide, ethylene glycol, sodium trichlorophenate, and approximately 15 to 30 kg of TCDD (3). At the nominal reaction temperature, TCDD is normally seen only in trace amounts of less than 1 ppm (parts per million). However, in the higher-temperature conditions associated with the runaway reaction, TCDD production apparently reached 166 ppm or more.

==Immediate effects==
The affected area was split into zones A, B, and R in decreasing order of surface soil concentrations of TCDD. Zone A was further split into 7 sub-zones. The local population was advised not to touch or eat locally grown fruits or vegetables.
*Zone A had a TCDD soil concentration of &gt; 50 micrograms per square metre (μg/m2); it had between 736 – 753 residents.
*Zone B had a TCDD soil concentration of between 5 and 50 μg/m2; it had 4737 residents.
*Zone R had a negligible concentration of TCDD or up to &lt; 5 μg/m2; it had 31,800 residents.

The population who lived in the path of the aerosol cloud reportedly developed acute symptoms such as headaches, nausea, and eye irritation. 19 children in the area were hospitalized with skin lesions. 500 residents in the area were treated for acute skin irritation. The accident also immediately caused 193 individuals to develop chloracne, none of whom were employed at the ICMESA plant. By the 2nd of August, all residents in Zone A were evacuated and the area was fenced off, however evacuation only began 15 days after the accident took place. After evacuation, all residents of Zone A were medically examined and laboratory tests were performed, Ultimately, 640 individuals living in the region were affected with chloracne.

An estimated 25% of all animals in Zone A died immediately after exposure to the aerosol cloud, and by the end July, 3,300 animals, mostly poultry and rabbits, were found dead. Emergency slaughtering commenced to prevent TCDD from entering the food chain, and by 1978 over 80,000 animals had been culled.

The residents of Zone B were not evacuated but were given warnings to refrain from eating locally-grown produce and poultry. The residents of Zone B were given medical examinations and clinical laboratory tests. Pregnant women and children under 12 years old were relocated on a daily basis.

Residents of Zone R were only warned to not eat locally grown foods.

An advice center was set up for pregnant women, of whom 26 opted for an abortion (which was legal in special cases) after consultation. Another 460 women continued their pregnancies without problems, their children not showing any sign of malformation. Herwig von Zwehl (Technical Director of ICMESA) and Paolo Paoletti (director of production at ICMESA) were arrested. Two government commissions were established to develop a plan for quarantining and decontaminating the area, for which the Italian government allotted 40 billion lire (US$47.8 million). This amount was tripled two years later.

==Studies on immediate and long-term health effects==
A 1991 study, fourteen years after the accident, sought to assess the effects to the thousands of persons that had been exposed to dioxin. The most evident adverse health effect ascertained was chloracne (193 cases). Other early effects noted were peripheral neuropathy and liver enzyme induction. The ascertainment of other, possibly severe sequelae of dioxin exposure (e.g., birth defects) was hampered by inadequate information; however, generally, no increased risks were evident.

A study published in 1998 concluded that chloracne (nearly 200 cases with a definite exposure dependence) was the only effect established with certainty. Early health investigations including liver function, immune function, neurologic impairment, and reproductive effects yielded inconclusive results.

An excess mortality rate from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases was uncovered, and excess of diabetes cases was also found. Results of cancer incidence and mortality follow-up showed an increased occurrence of cancer of the gastrointestinal sites and of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue. Results cannot be viewed as final or comprehensive, however, because of various limitations: the lack of individual exposure data, short latency period, and small population size for certain cancer types.

A 2001 study confirmed in victims of the disaster, that dioxin is carcinogenic to humans and corroborate its association with cardiovascular- and endocrine-related effects. In 2009, an update including 5 more years (up to 1996) found an increase in &quot;lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue neoplasms&quot; and increased breast cancer.

A 2008 study evaluated whether maternal exposure is associated with modified neonatal thyroid function in the highly exposed population in Seveso and concluded that environmental contaminants such as dioxins have a long-lasting capability to modify neonatal thyroid function after the initial exposure.

The male children of mothers who were, during pregnancy of those children, exposed to high levels of toxic dioxins due to the Seveso disaster, have been found to have lower-than-average sperm counts. This result of the underlying Seveso study has been noted to provide the most pronounced evidence for prenatal exposure to an environmental chemical causing low sperm counts.

==Cleanup operations==

In January 1977, an action plan consisting of scientific analysis, economic aid, medical monitoring and restoration/decontamination was completed. Shortly after ICMESA began to pay the first compensations to those affected. Later that spring decontamination operations were initiated and in June a system epidemiological health monitoring for 220,000 people was launched. They then used trichlorophenol to make a drug to fight the skin infections, which they tested in dogs.

In June 1978, the Italian government raised its special loan from 40 to 115 billion lire. By the end of the year, most individual compensation claims had been settled out of court. On 5 February 1980, Paolo Paoletti (the Director of Production at ICMESA) was shot and killed in Monza by a member of the Italian radical left-wing terrorist organization Prima Linea. 
On 19 December 1980, representatives of the Region of Lombardy/Italian Republic and Givaudan/ICMESA signed a compensation agreement in the presence of the prime minister of Italy, Arnaldo Forlani. The total amount would reach 20 billion lire.

===Waste from the cleanup===
The waste from the clean up of the plant was a mixture of protective clothing and chemical residues from the plant. This waste was packed into waste drums which had been designed for the storage of nuclear waste. It was agreed that the waste would be disposed of in a legal manner.

To this end, in spring 1982, the firm Mannesmann Italiana was contracted to dispose of the contaminated chemicals from Zone A. Mannesmann Italiana made it a condition that Givaudan would not be notified of the disposal site which prompted Givaudan to insist that a notary public certify the disposal. On 9 September, 41 barrels of toxic waste left the ICMESA premises. On 13 December, the notary gave a sworn statement that the barrels had been disposed of in an approved way.

However, in February 1983, the programme &quot;A bon entendeur&quot; on Télévision Suisse Romande, a French language Swiss television channel, followed the route of the barrels to Saint-Quentin in northern France where they disappeared. A public debate ensued in which numerous theories were put forward when it was found that Mannesmann Italiana had hired two subcontractors to dispose of the toxic waste. On 19 May, the 41 barrels were found in an unused abattoir in Anguilcourt-le-Sart, a village in northern France. From there they were transferred to a French military base near Sissonne. The Roche Group (parent firm of Givaudan) took it upon itself to properly dispose of the waste. On 25 November, over nine years after the disaster, the Roche Group issued a public statement that the toxic waste consisting of 42 barrels (one was added earlier that year) had all been incinerated in Switzerland. According to &quot;New Scientist&quot;, it was thought that the high chlorine content of the waste might cause damage to the high temperature incinerator used by Roche, but Roche stated that they would burn the waste in the incinerator and repair it afterward if it were damaged. They stated that they wanted to take responsibility for the safe destruction of the waste.

===Criminal court case===

In September 1983, the Criminal Court of Monza sentenced five former employees of ICMESA or its parent company, Givaudan, to prison sentences ranging from 2.5 years to 5 years. They all appealed.

In May 1985, the Court of Appeal in Milan found three of the five accused not guilty; the two still facing prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court in Rome.

On 23 May 1986, the Supreme Court in Rome confirmed the judgment against the two remaining defendants, even though the prosecuting attorney had called for their acquittal.

==Aftermath==
After the incident, ICMESA initially refused to admit that the dioxin release had occurred. At least a week passed before a public statement was issued that dioxin had been emitted, and another week passed before an evacuation began. Even then, the government was saddled with the responsibility of determining the boundaries of the evacuation area, and thereafter to organise the evacuation. This constituted a major imposition on the community as well as on government resources.
It was soon recognized that the factory&#x27;s very rudimentary safety systems had been designed with little more than simple explosion prevention in mind. Environmental protection had not been considered. Nor had any consideration been given as to setting up any type of warning system or health-protection protocols for the local community. As a result, the local population was caught unaware when the accident happened, and thus was unprepared to cope with the danger of an invisible poison.
In the context of such heightened tensions, Seveso became a microcosm where all the existing conflicts within society (political, institutional, religious, industrial) were reflected. However, within a relatively short time, such conflicts abated and the recovery of the community proceeded. For, in Seveso, the responsible party was known from the outset and soon offered reparation. Moreover, the eventual disappearance of the offending factory itself and the physical exportation of the toxic substances and polluted soil enabled the community to feel cleansed. The resolution of the emotional after-effects of the trauma, so necessary for the recovery of a community, was facilitated by these favourable circumstances.&quot;
Industrial safety regulations were passed in the European Community in 1982 called the Seveso Directive, which imposed much stronger industrial regulations. The Seveso Directive was updated in 1996, 2008 and 2012 and is currently referred to as the Seveso III Directive (or COMAH Regulations in the United Kingdom).
Treatment of the soil in the affected areas is now considered complete, since the dioxin levels are now below background. The entire site has been turned into a public park known as Seveso Oak Forest Park. This area is permanently off-limits to development. There are two artificial hills in the park; today, underneath these hills are the toxic remnants (including destroyed houses, tons of contaminated soil, and animal remains), all protected in a concrete sarcophagus. Investigations into site conditions have confirmed that the sarcophagus life expectancy of 300 years is expected, appropriate, and required.
Several studies have been completed on the health of the population of surrounding communities. While it has been established that people from Seveso exposed to TCDD are more susceptible to certain rare cancers, when all types of cancers are grouped into one category, no statistically significant increase has yet been reported in any specific cancer category. This indicates that more research is needed to determine the true long-term health effects on the affected population.
Epidemiological monitoring programmes were established as follows (with termination dates): abortions (1982); malformations (1982); tumours (1997); deaths (1997). Health monitoring of workers at ICMESA and on decontamination projects, and chloracne sufferers (1985)

The documentary &quot;Gambit&quot; is about Jörg Sambeth, the technical director of ICMESA, who was sentenced to five years in the first trial, and had his sentence reduced to two years and was paroled on appeal.

<text>Nathan Hale (June 6, 1755 – September 22, 1776) was an American Patriot, soldier and spy for the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He volunteered for an intelligence-gathering mission in New York City but was captured by the British and executed. Hale is considered an American hero and in 1985 was officially designated the state hero of Connecticut.

==Early life and family==
Nathan Hale was born in Coventry, Connecticut, in 1755, to Deacon Richard Hale and Elizabeth Strong, a descendant of Elder John Strong. He was a great-grandson of Reverend John Hale, an important figure in the Salem witch trials of 1692. He was also the grand-uncle of Edward Everett Hale, a Unitarian minister, writer, and activist noted for social causes including abolitionism. He was the uncle of journalist Nathan Hale, who founded the &quot;Boston Daily Advertiser&quot; and helped establish the &quot;North American Review&quot;.

In 1769, when Nathan Hale was fourteen years old, he was sent with his brother Enoch, who was sixteen, to Yale College. He was a classmate of fellow Patriot spy Benjamin Tallmadge. The Hale brothers belonged to the Linonian Society of Yale, which debated topics in astronomy, mathematics, literature, and the ethics of slavery. Nathan graduated with first-class honors in 1773 at age 18 and became a teacher, first in East Haddam and later in New London.

==American Revolutionary War==
After the Revolutionary War began in 1775, Hale joined a Connecticut militia unit and was elected first lieutenant within five months. His company participated in the Siege of Boston, but Hale remained behind. It has been suggested that he was unsure as to whether he wanted to fight, or possibly that he was hindered because his teaching contract in New London did not expire until several months later, in July 1775. On July 4, 1775, Hale received a letter from his classmate and friend Benjamin Tallmadge, who had gone to Boston to see the siege for himself. He wrote to Hale, &quot;Was I in your condition, I think the more extensive service would be my choice. Our holy Religion, the honor of our God, a glorious country, &amp; a happy constitution is what we have to defend.&quot; Tallmadge&#x27;s letter was so inspiring that, several days later, Hale accepted a commission as first lieutenant in the 7th Connecticut Regiment under Colonel Charles Webb of Stamford.

Hale was also a member of Knowlton&#x27;s Rangers, the first organized intelligence service organization of the United States of America, led by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Knowlton. In the spring of 1776, the Continental Army moved to Manhattan to defend New York City against the anticipated British attack. In August, the British soundly defeated the Continentals in the Battle of Long Island via a flanking move from Staten Island across Brooklyn. General George Washington was desperate to determine the location of the imminent British invasion of Manhattan. To that end, Washington called for a spy behind enemy lines, and Hale was the only volunteer.
===Intelligence-gathering mission===
On September 8, 1776, Hale volunteered to go behind enemy lines and report on British troop movements, which he knew was an act of spying punishable by death. On September 12, he was ferried across Long Island Sound to Huntington, New York on British-controlled Long Island. Hale planned to disguise himself as a Dutch schoolteacher looking for work, although he did not travel under an assumed name and reportedly carried with him his Yale diploma bearing his name.

While Hale was undercover, New York City—then an area at the southern tip of Manhattan, mostly south of what is now Chambers Street—fell to British forces on September 15, so Washington was forced to retreat to the north in Harlem Heights (now Morningside Heights). On September 21, a quarter of the lower portion of Manhattan burned in the Great New York Fire of 1776. The fire was later widely thought to have been started by American saboteurs in order to keep the city from falling into British hands, and though setting fire to New York during Washington&#x27;s retreat had indeed been proposed, Washington and Congress had rejected the idea and denied responsibility. The Americans accused British soldiers of starting the fires without orders from their superiors so they could sack the city. In the fire&#x27;s aftermath, more than two-hundred American Patriots were detained by the British for questioning.

An account of Hale&#x27;s capture, later obtained by the Library of Congress, was written by Consider Tiffany, a Connecticut shopkeeper and Loyalist. In Tiffany&#x27;s account, Major Robert Rogers of the Queen&#x27;s Rangers saw Hale in a tavern and recognized him. After luring Hale into betraying his allegiance by pretending to be a Patriot himself, Rogers and his Rangers apprehended Hale near Flushing Bay in Queens, New York. Another story is that Hale&#x27;s cousin, a Loyalist named Samuel Hale, was the one who revealed his true identity.

British General William Howe had established his headquarters in the Beekman House in a then-rural part of Manhattan, on a rise between what are now 50th and 51st Streets between First and Second Avenues, near where Beekman Place commemorates the connection. Hale reportedly was questioned by Howe, and physical evidence was found on him. Rogers provided information about the case. According to some accounts, Hale spent the night in a greenhouse at the mansion, while others say he spent it in a bedroom there. He requested a Bible; his request was denied. Sometime later, he requested a clergyman. Again, the request was denied. General Howe did permit him to write letters: one to his brother Enoch and other to his commanding officer, but the next day, they were torn up in front of him by the provost marshal, Captain Cunningham.

===Death and purported last words===

According to the standards of the time, spies were hanged as illegal combatants. By all accounts, Hale comported himself well before the hanging. Frederick MacKensie, a British officer, wrote this diary entry for the day:

On the morning of September 22, 1776, Hale was marched along Post Road to the Park of Artillery, which was next to a public house called the Dove Tavern (at modern-day 66th Street and Third Avenue), and hanged. He was 21 years old.

No official records were kept of Hale&#x27;s final speech. It has traditionally been reported that his last words, either entirely or in part, were: &quot;I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.&quot; The account of the quote originated with British Captain John Montresor, who was present at the hanging. The next day, he spoke with American Captain William Hull under a flag of truce. Hull recorded in his memoirs the following quote by Montresor:

Because Hull was not an eyewitness to Hale&#x27;s speech, some historians have questioned the reliability of this account.

Over the years, there has been a great deal of speculation as to whether Hale uttered this line or some variation of it. If Hale did not originate the statement, it is possible he instead repeated a passage from Joseph Addison&#x27;s play &quot;Cato&quot;, which was widely popular at the time and an ideological inspiration to many Whigs:

It is almost certain that Hale&#x27;s last speech was longer than one sentence. Several early accounts mention different things he said. These are not necessarily contradictory, but rather, together they give an idea of what the speech might have been like. The following quotes are all taken from George Dudley Seymour&#x27;s book, &quot;Documentary Life of Nathan Hale&quot;, published in 1941 by the author. Enoch Hale, Nathan&#x27;s brother, wrote in his diary after he questioned people who had been present, October 26, 1776, &quot;When at the Gallows he spoke &amp; told them that he was a Capt in the Cont Army by name Nathan Hale.&quot; The February 13, 1777, issue of the &quot;Essex Journal&quot; stated, &quot;However, at the gallows, he made a sensible and spirited speech; among other things, told them they were shedding the blood of the innocent, and that if he had ten thousand lives, he would lay them all down, if called to it, in defence of his injured, bleeding Country.&quot; The May 17, 1781, issue of the &quot;Independent Chronicle and the Universal Advertiser&quot; gave the following version: &quot;I am so satisfied with the cause in which I have engaged, that my only regret is, that I have not more lives than one to offer in its service.&quot;

Aside from the site at 66th Street and Third Avenue, two other sites in Manhattan claim to be the hanging site:
* City Hall Park, where a statue of Hale designed by Frederick William MacMonnies was erected in 1890
* Inside Grand Central Terminal
The Yale Club bears a plaque hung by the Daughters of the American Revolution which states the event occurred &quot;near&quot; the Club. Yale is Hale&#x27;s alma mater and the Club is at 44th Street and Vanderbilt Avenue, mere feet from Grand Central Terminal. Another account places Hale&#x27;s execution at Bergen Beach, Brooklyn, but there is no evidence to support this claim.

Hale&#x27;s body was never found. His family erected an empty grave cenotaph in Nathan Hale Cemetery in South Coventry Historic District, Connecticut.

===Statues and appearance===


Statues of Hale are based on idealized archetypes; no contemporaneous portraits of him have been found. Documents and letters reveal Hale was an informed, practical, detail-oriented man who planned ahead. Of his appearance and demeanor, fellow soldier Lieutenant Elisha Bostwick wrote that Hale had blue eyes, flaxen blond hair, darker eyebrows, and stood slightly taller than the average height of the time, with mental powers of a sedate mind and piousness. Bostwick wrote:
Hale has been honored with two standing images:
* A statue designed by Frederick William MacMonnies was dedicated on the anniversary of Evacuation Day, November 25, 1893, at City Hall Park, New York. The statue established Hale&#x27;s modern idealized square-jawed image. A copy of MacMonnies&#x27;s statue stands in Williams Park in New London, Connecticut.
* A statue of Hale, sculpted 1908–1912 by Bela Pratt, was cast in 1912 and stands in front of Connecticut Hall, where Hale resided while at Yale. Copies of this sculpture stand at the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts; the Nathan Hale Homestead in Coventry; the Connecticut Governor&#x27;s Residence in Hartford, Connecticut; Fort Nathan Hale in New Haven, Connecticut; Mitchell College in New London, Connecticut; the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.; Tribune Tower in Chicago; and at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Virginia.

Other statues/markers include:
* A statue of Hale with an inscription of his reported last words on the first floor of the Connecticut State Capitol in Hartford. Statues of Hale are also located in the Tulane University Law School reading room, and at the corner of Summit and Portland Avenues in Saint Paul, Minnesota.
* A memorial for him located in Huntington, New York, where he landed for his fatal spying mission.
* A historical marker in Freese Park, Norwalk, Connecticut, that is denoted as the embarkation point.
* A obelisk known as the Captain Nathan Hale Monument was erected in his honor in 1846 in his birthplace of Coventry, Connecticut.
In January 1899 a play based on Hale&#x27;s life, &quot;Nathan Hale&quot; by Clyde Fitch, opened at New York&#x27;s Knickerbocker Theatre, where it played successfully for eight weeks. It then toured for more than a year, with 41-year-old Nat Goodwin playing Hale and Goodwin&#x27;s wife Maxine Elliott playing Alice Adams.

===Ballads===
Two early ballads attempt to recreate Hale&#x27;s last speech. &quot;Songs and Ballads of the Revolution&quot; (1855), collected by F. Moore, contained the &quot;Ballad of Nathan Hale&quot; (anonymous), dated 1776: &quot;Thou pale king of terrors, thou life&#x27;s gloomy foe, Go frighten the slave; go frighten the slave; Tell tyrants, to you their allegiance they owe. No fears for the brave; no fears for the brave.&quot;; and &quot;To the Memory of Capt. Nathan Hale&quot;, by Eneas Munson Sr., was written soon after Hale&#x27;s death:

Munson had tutored Hale before college, and knew him and his family well, so even though the particulars of this speech may be unlikely, Munson knew first-hand what Hale&#x27;s opinions were.

<text>A vanity press or vanity publisher, sometimes also subsidy publisher, is a book printer that is paid by authors to self-publish their books. A vanity press charges fees in advance and does not contribute to the development of the book. It has been described as a scam, though, as the book does get printed, it does not necessarily rise to the level of fraud. The term &quot;vanity press&quot; is derogatory, so it is not used by the printers. Some self-publishing businesses prefer to market themselves as an independent press, and some authors who are self-publishing through CreateSpace and Amazon Kindle prefer to market themselves as indie authors instead of as self-publishing authors.

It is not to be confused with hybrid publishing, where the publisher and author collaborate and &quot;share&quot; costs and risks, or with assisted self-publishing, where the authors, sometimes styling themselves as &quot;authorpreneurs&quot;, pay various contractors and publishing services to assist them with self-publishing their own book, and retain all rights.

== Vanity publishing vs mainstream publishing ==
Mainstream publishers never charge authors to publish their books; the publisher bears all the risks of publication and pays all the costs. Because of that financial risk, mainstream publishers are extremely selective in what they will publish, and reject most manuscripts submitted to them. The high level of rejection is why some authors publish with vanity presses. James D. Macdonald says, &quot;Money should always flow towards the author&quot;, a concept sometimes called Yog&#x27;s Law.

Mainstream publishers also provide services. Ordinary author services, such as editing, book cover design, and publicity, are provided by mainstream publishers for free, whereas a vanity press charges fees for these services. 

== Vanity publishing vs hybrid publishing ==
Hybrid publishing is the source of debate in the publishing industry, with some viewing hybrid publishers as vanity presses in disguise. However, a true hybrid publisher is selective in what they publish and will share the costs (and therefore the risks) with the author, whereas with a vanity press, the author pays the full cost of production and therefore carries all the risk. A vanity press has absolutely no interest in whether the book is saleable or suitable for publication. 

Given the bad reputation of vanity publishing, many vanity presses brand themselves as hybrids, leading to exploitation of writers. The Society of Authors (SoA) and the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain (WGGB) have called for reform of the hybrid/paid-for publishing sector. Trade unions representing 14,800 authors jointly published a report to expose widespread bad practices among companies that charge writers to publish their work while taking away their rights.

==Vanity publishing vs assisted self-publishing==
It is often stated that many famous authors, such as Mark Twain and Jane Austen, have used vanity publishers. This is incorrect and confuses self-publishing with vanity publishing. 

In a variant of Yog&#x27;s law for self-publishing, author John Scalzi has proposed an alternate definition to distinguish self-publishing from vanity publishing: &quot;While in the process of self-publishing, money and rights are controlled by the writer.&quot; 

Self-publishing is distinguished from vanity publishing by the writer maintaining control of copyright as well as the editorial and publishing process, including marketing and distribution.

== Vanity publishing scams ==
Vanity presses often engage in deceptive practices or offer costly, poor-quality services with limited recourse available to the writer. In the US, these practices have been cited by the Better Business Bureau as unfavorable reports by consumers.

One common scam is when a vanity press pretends to operate a traditional publishing arm, where the publishing house bears the full cost. However, when an author submits his work, he is told it does not quite meet the standards required for traditional publishing, but that the company will still publish it if the author pays for something—engaging their professional editor, committing to buying a large number of copies of the book, or another similar excuse. In reality, the exorbitant fee charged for these services will fully cover the vanity publisher&#x27;s costs for producing the book. Such a scam is a plot point in Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot;.

==Vanity publishing in other media==

The vanity press model exists for other media such as videos, music and photography. A notable example is ARK Music Factory, which, for a fee, produced and released Rebecca Black&#x27;s 2011 viral video &quot;Friday&quot;. 

Vanity academic journals also exist, often called predatory journals, which publish with little or no editorial oversight, although they may claim to be peer reviewed. One such predatory journal, the &quot;International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology&quot;, accepted for publication a paper called &quot;Get me off Your Fucking Mailing List&quot; consisting of the sentence &quot;Get me off your fucking mailing list.&quot; repeated many times.

Vanity photography magazines often have little or no physical circulation, relying instead on the submitting photographers buying the magazine after publication. Some also charge a submission fee. Magazines such as &quot;Lucy&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Jute&quot;, and &quot;Pump&quot; – all managed by parent publisher Kavyar – often accept photograph submissions for free, or for a minimal fee to be featured on a magazine cover.

==History==

The term &quot;vanity press&quot; appeared in mainstream U.S. publications as early as 1941. In that year, C. M. Flumiani was sentenced to 18 months in a US prison for mail fraud, arising from his scheme that promised book promotion (a line in a catalog), expert editing (they accepted all books), and acting as agent bringing books to his own publishing houses.

By 1956, the three leading American vanity presses (Vantage Press, Exposition Press, and Pageant Press) were each publishing more than 100 titles per year.

Ernest Vincent Wright, author of the 1939 novel &quot;Gadsby&quot;, written entirely in lipogram, was unable to find a publisher for his work and ultimately chose to publish it through a vanity press.

<text>Robin Brunskill Cooke, Baron Cooke of Thorndon, (9 May 1926 – 30 August 2006) was a New Zealand judge and later a British Law Lord and member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. He is widely considered one of New Zealand&#x27;s most influential jurists, and is the only New Zealand judge to have sat in the House of Lords. He was a Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong from 1997 to 2006.

==Early life and education==
The son of the Supreme Court judge Justice Philip Brunskill Cooke and his wife, Valmai, Lord Cooke was born in Wellington and attended Wanganui Collegiate School. He graduated with an LL.M. from Victoria University College, and subsequently studied at Clare College, Cambridge as a Research Fellow. While on a travelling scholarship, Lord Cooke was awarded an MA in 1954 from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge and subsequently a PhD in 1955.

In 1952, he married Annette Miller, with whom he had three sons. One of their sons, Francis, was appointed to the High Court in 2018 and the Court of Appeal in 2024.

==Legal career==

Cooke was admitted to the New Zealand bar in 1950, and was also admitted to the English bar as a barrister of Inner Temple in 1954. He practised law in New Zealand as a barrister for almost twenty years, and was appointed as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1964. At age 38, that was the youngest appointment of a QC in New Zealand; the young age record had previously been held by his father, who had been appointed aged 43. 

In 1972, he was appointed as a Judge of the (former) New Zealand Supreme Court (now High Court). He held this position until 1976 when he was elevated to the New Zealand Court of Appeal (at that time the country&#x27;s highest local court). In 1986, he was appointed as President of that Court – a position he was to hold for the next 10 years. On his retirement from the Court of Appeal in 1996 Cook was granted a British life peerage as Baron Cooke of Thorndon, (a suburb of Wellington) in New Zealand and of Cambridge in the County of Cambridgeshire, becoming a member of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords where he sat as a Lord of Appeal (Law Lord) until his retirement in 2001. 

He also sat (from time to time) as President in the Courts of Appeal of Samoa, the Cook Islands and Kiribati; as well as being a Non-Permanent Judge on the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal and a Judge of the Supreme Court of Fiji.

Cooke was the only Commonwealth judge in the past century to sit in the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords on United Kingdom appeals. He adjudicated on nearly a hundred cases in the House of Lords and the Privy Council; his final case before retirement was &quot;Delaware v City of Westminster&quot;, in October 2001.

Cooke died in Wellington on 30 August 2006. His wife, Annette, Lady Cooke, died in 2024.

==Legal philosophy and influence on the law==
Cooke is New Zealand&#x27;s best known jurist, and is regarded as perhaps the finest judge which the country has produced. He is most widely known for his contribution to the development of administrative law (both in New Zealand and internationally) and his influence in the development of legal recognition for the Treaty of Waitangi.

Cooke was a champion of the need to develop independent jurisprudence for New Zealand. In 1956, having recently returned from the United Kingdom, he criticised New Zealand&#x27;s judiciary for its &quot;unquestioning compliance&quot; with English case law. By 1988, Lord Cooke was pleased to be able to report that &quot;in virtually every major field of law New Zealand law is radically, or at least very considerably, different from English law&quot;. This change was thanks in part to his own efforts. Yet Lord Cooke did not believe that different jurisdictions had nothing to learn from each other. Rather, he believed that &quot;[c]ommon denominators may be usefully sought, as long as the process is not compelled from outside and the national ethos is allowed its own weight.&quot;

===Administrative law jurisprudence===
Lord Cooke took what could be considered a natural law approach to public law, often seeking to assert a right for the courts to intervene where none was prescribed in legislation. In &quot;Fraser v State Services Commission&quot; he famously made the comment that &quot;it is arguable that some common law rights may go so deep that even Parliament cannot be accepted by the Courts to have destroyed them.&quot; This view contradicted the dominant parliamentary supremacy theories of A. V. Dicey, which had guided common law courts since the late 19th century. However, Cooke&#x27;s position recalled a similar opinion expressed by the famous 17th century English jurist, Sir Edward Coke.

In &quot;Bulk Gas Users Group v Attorney-General&quot;, the then Justice Cooke delivered the leading judgment of the Court of Appeal. Cooke held that a privative clause in the Commerce Act 1975 did not prevent the courts from reviewing a decision made by the Secretary of Energy. He observed that &quot;the Courts of general jurisdiction will be slow to conclude&quot; that they are not permitted to rule on a question of law. This reluctance to accept the ouster of the court&#x27;s jurisdiction was characteristic of Cooke&#x27;s views on the importance of the courts&#x27; role in upholding the rule of law.

He took a similar approach in 1985, when he delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case of &quot;Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union&quot; allowing the appeal of lawyers seeking an injunction against the NZRFU&#x27;s proposed tour of South Africa. The proposed tour followed the controversial 1981 Springbok Tour, and was cancelled after the High Court re-heard the case in light of the Court of Appeal&#x27;s judgment.

Perhaps the most famous public law case which Cooke decided came before him when he was President of the Court of Appeal. In &quot;Simpson v Attorney-General&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;Baigent&#x27;s case&quot;), the Court held that it is implicit in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 that breaches of human rights by public officials could result in a claim for damages — even though there is no such provision in the Act itself. In the case, the Police had mistakenly carried out a search warrant at the wrong address. Because the occupant of the house was not charged with any crime, there was no obvious remedy for the Police&#x27;s illegal search (exclusion of improperly obtained evidence being the usual remedy applied in Bill of Rights Act cases). In delivering the leading judgment, President Cooke remarked that &quot;we [the Court] would fail in our duty if we did not give an effective remedy to a person whose legislatively affirmed rights have been infringed&quot;.

===Treaty of Waitangi jurisprudence===
In 1987, Cooke delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the landmark case of &quot;New Zealand Maori Council&quot; v &quot;Attorney-General&quot;, which sought to clarify what Parliament meant by section 9 of the State Owned Enterprises Act 1986. The Act stated &quot;Nothing in this act shall permit the Crown to act in a manner that is inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi&quot;, but what those principles might be was left to the courts to decide. The principles elicited by President Cooke gave legal recognition to the special relationship between the Crown and Maori. Cooke held that &quot;the Treaty created an enduring relationship of a fiduciary nature akin to a partnership, each party accepting a positive duty to act in good faith, fairly, reasonably and honourably towards the other&quot;. This principle of partnership continues to shape the legal relations between the Crown and Maori to this day.

===Legal commentary===
Lord Cooke&#x27;s often bold views occasionally drew criticism. In one noteworthy example, some of Australia&#x27;s most senior judges co-wrote the Preface of &quot;Meagher, Gummow and Lehane’s Equity, Doctrines and Remedies&quot;, where they blamed &quot;Lord Cooke&#x27;s misguided endeavours&quot; for what they saw as the Court of Appeal&#x27;s unprincipled decisions concerning the merger of common law and equitable doctrines in New Zealand. The authors went on to remark &quot;[t]hat one man could, in a few years, cause such destruction exposes the fragility of contemporary legal systems and the need for vigilant exposure and rooting out of error&quot;. However, not all their colleagues shared such concerns. Justice Kirby (of the High Court of Australia), in his 2008 W A Lee Lecture, noted that Lord Cooke&#x27;s supposedly &quot;heretical&quot; views had in fact been accepted by many prominent jurists in the United Kingdom, including the House of Lords. He took issue with the tone of the &quot;Meagher&quot; Preface, remarking that &quot;those familiar with the successive &#x27;rooting out&#x27; of heretics in England under the later Tudors will recognise the &quot;genre&quot; of this denunciatory writing. Burning at the professional stake would seem too kind a fate for such doctrinal rascals.&quot;

Cooke himself had a formidable extrajudicial and academic presence. From 1992 until 1996, Cooke was General Editor of &quot;The Laws of New Zealand&quot; and selected the original authors for the different titles. He was also a prolific contributor to legal journals, including the &quot;Law Quarterly Review&quot;, &quot;Cambridge Law Journal&quot; and &quot;New Zealand Law Journal&quot;.

In 1996, Lord Cooke delivered the 47th Hamlyn Lecture Series, entitled &quot;Turning Points of the Common Law&quot;. In each of his four lectures, he focused on a single major case (covering public law, crime, tort and company law) and the influence of that case on the development of the common law as a whole throughout the Commonwealth.

<text>A skort (a portmanteau of skirt and shorts) is a pair of shorts with an overlapping fabric panel made to resemble a skirt covering the front, or a skirt with a pair of integral shorts hidden underneath.

==History==

Initially called &quot;trouser skirts&quot;, skorts were developed to provide more freedom to do activities (such as sports, gardening, cleaning, or bike riding), and give the appearance of a skirt. At first, skorts were not deemed appropriate to be worn during any non-athletic activity.

Montgomery Ward claimed in their 1959 Spring/Summer catalog to have invented the garment they called a skort. It was a short knife or accordion pleated skirt with an attached bloomer underneath. Years later, the term was applied to a pair of shorts with a flap of fabric across the front (and often the back) making the garment appear to be a skirt. In recent years, the term skort has been given to any skirt with an attached pair of shorts.

== Predecessors ==
The origins of skorts may be related back to earlier garments such as bloomers and jupe-culottes which grew in popularity in the late 19th century and early 20th century, despite common public disapproval for women wearing pants. In 1911, Paul Poiret produced several designs that were a combination of skirts and trousers, and they became known as jupe-culottes or as harem pants. Similar to skorts, culottes involve various styles that may appear as a hybrid between pants and skirts. Skorts are distinguished by their construction as a pair of shorts with material over it to make it appear as a skirt.

==Women&#x27;s sports==
Skorts are popular in sports such as field hockey, tennis, golf, ten-pin bowling and camogie, and are often part of girls&#x27; athletic uniforms.

The first noted skort-like clothing to be worn as tennis attire was done so by the Spanish player, Lilí Álvarez, who wore a pair of culottes which had been shaped to resemble a skirt during her Wimbledon match in 1931.

Skorts continue to be popular in sports such as tennis, golf, and field hockey, but have also gained popularity in casual and athletic wear due to brands such as Lululemon.

In addition to their practicality, skorts have also become a fashion statement, with many brands offering them in a variety of styles and designs. High-waisted skorts, skorts with ruffles or asymmetrical hems, and skorts made with patterned or textured fabrics have all become popular options.

Overall, skorts have evolved from being a practical uniform option for girls in sports to a versatile and trendy clothing item that can be worn for a variety of activities.

<text>The UL enterprise is a global private safety company headquartered in Northbrook, Illinois, composed of three organizations, UL Research Institutes, UL Standards &amp; Engagement and UL Solutions.

Established in 1894, the UL enterprise was founded as the Underwriters&#x27; Electrical Bureau (a bureau of the National Board of Fire Underwriters), and was known throughout the 20th century as Underwriters Laboratories. On January 1, 2012, Underwriters Laboratories became the parent company of a for-profit company in the U.S. named UL LLC, a limited liability company, which took over the product testing and certification business. On June 26, 2022, the companies rebranded into three distinct organizations that make up the UL enterprise. 

The company is one of several companies approved to perform safety testing by the U.S. federal agency Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). OSHA maintains a list of approved testing laboratories, which are known as Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories. According to Lifehacker, UL Solutions is the best-known product safety and certification organization globally.

== History ==

Underwriters Laboratories Inc. was founded in 1894 by William Henry Merrill. After graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with a degree in electrical engineering in 1889, Merrill went to work as an electrical inspector for the Boston Board of Fire Underwriters. At the turn of the twentieth century, fire loss was on the rise in the United States, and the increasing use of electricity in homes and businesses posed a serious threat to property and human life.

In order to determine and mitigate risk, Merrill proposed to open a laboratory where he would use scientific principles to test products for fire and electrical safety. The Boston Board of Fire Underwriters turned this idea down, perhaps due to Merrill&#x27;s youth and relative inexperience at the time.

In May 1893, Merrill moved to Chicago to work for the Chicago Fire Underwriters&#x27; Association. His task was to inspect the city&#x27;s fire alarm systems. He was also sent to the 1893 World&#x27;s Fair to inspect the Fair&#x27;s electrical installations and the Palace of Electricity. In order to determine and mitigate risk in his role as an electrical inspector, Merrill found it necessary to conduct tests on building materials and electrical components. Upon seeing a growing potential in this field, Merrill stayed in Chicago to found Underwriters Laboratories. He received initial funding from the Chicago Fire Underwriters&#x27; Association and the Western Insurance Union, a local insurance organization. With $350 of equipment, he opened a small laboratory on the third floor of a local fire insurance patrol station, signing UL&#x27;s first test report on March 24, 1894.

Merrill soon went to work on developing safety standards, conducting tests, and uncovering hazards. In the early years, UL tested three main types of products: devices meant to stop fire (such as fire extinguishers), devices meant to resist fire (such as fire doors), and devices that frequently caused fire (like wires used for electrical installations). This work soon expanded, and throughout the twentieth century, UL certified many pivotal consumer technologies, such as vacuum cleaners, televisions, microwaves, personal computers, and more.

UL published its first standard, &quot;Tin Clad Fire Doors&quot;, in 1903. In 1906, UL established a Label Service for certain product categories that require more frequent inspections. Products that passed UL&#x27;s testing and regular inspections were given a UL label, which eventually evolved into the UL Mark. From 1905 to 1979, UL Headquarters was located at 207-231 East Ohio Street in Chicago. In 1979, the organization moved its headquarters to a 153-acre campus in Northbrook, Illinois, 25 miles north of its former downtown Chicago location.

UL Solutions has evolved from its roots in electrical and fire safety to address broader safety issues, such as hazardous substances, water quality, food safety, performance testing, safety and compliance education, and environmental sustainability.

On January 1, 2012, Underwriters Laboratories became the parent company of a for-profit company in the U.S named UL LLC, a limited liability corporation. The for-profit company took over the product testing and certification business.

In 2022, the company revised their go-to-market strategy to include three separate organizations - UL Solutions, UL Standards &amp; Engagement, and UL Research Institutes.

UL Solutions became a public company via an initial public offering in April 2024 raising around $950million, valuing the company at about $7billion. The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

<text>The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) is the research, development, and evaluation agency of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). 

NIJ, along with the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), and other program offices, comprise the DOJ&#x27;s Office of Justice Programs (OJP).

==History==

The National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice was established on October 21, 1968, under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as a component of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA). In 1978, it was renamed as the National Institute of Justice. Some functions of the LEAA were absorbed by NIJ on December 27, 1979, with passage of the Justice System Improvement Act of 1979. The act, which amended the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, also led to creation of the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In 1982, the LEAA was succeeded by the Office of Justice Assistance, Research, and Statistics (1982–1984) and then the Office of Justice Programs in 1984.

NIJ was notable among U.S. governmental research organizations because it is headed by a political appointee of the president rather than by a scientist or a member of the civil service. The Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011 removed the need for Senate confirmation of the NIJ director.

In 2010, the United States National Research Council released a report on reforming the NIJ, and identified issues with its independence, budget, and scientific mission. While it considered making the NIJ separate from its current department, Office of Justice Programs, it recommended retaining the NIJ within the OJP but giving it increased independence and authority through clear qualifications for its director, control over its budget, and a statutory advisory board. It also recommended that the NIJ: (1) a focus on research rather than forensic capacity building activities,(2) increase funding for programs for graduate researchers, (3) increase transparency, and (4) do periodic self-assessments.

==Research areas==


NIJ is focused on advancing technology for criminal justice application including law enforcement and corrections, forensics, and judicial processes, as well as criminology, criminal justice, and related social science research. Much of this research is facilitated by providing grants to academic institutions, non-profit research organizations, and other entities, as well as collaborating with state and local governments. Areas of social science research include violence against women, corrections, and crime prevention, as well as program evaluation.
Grants for technology development help facilitate research and development of technology and tools for criminal justice application, which is a need that the private sector is otherwise reluctant to meet. NIJ also supports development of voluntary equipment performance standards, as well as conducting compliance testing. Areas of technology research and development include biometrics, communications interoperability, information technology, less-lethal technologies (e.g. tasers), and officer safety including bullet-proof vests. Crime mapping and analysis is a topic that includes both technology and social science (geography) aspects. The National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Centers, which are located throughout the United States, play a role in law enforcement technology development, testing, and dissemination.

In the 2000s, NIJ developed the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System.

===DNA initiative===
A major area of research and support is for forensics and the president&#x27;s DNA initiative. The Federal Bureau of Investigation developed the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) system as a central database of DNA profiles taken from offenders. In the late 1980s and 1990s, all of the states and the federal government required DNA samples to be collected from offenders in certain types of cases. The demand (casework) for DNA analysis in public crime laboratories increased 73% from 1997 to 2000, and by 2003, there was a backlog of 350,000 rape and homicide cases. In 2003, President George W. Bush proposed the &quot;Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology&quot; initiative, which would include $1 billion over five years to reduce backlogs, develop and improve capacity of state and local law enforcement to use DNA analysis, support research and development to improve the technology, and additional training for those working in the criminal justice system.

===Technical working groups===

Technical working groups (or TWGs) were created by the National Institute of Justice to create crime scene guides for state and local law enforcement. The guides were individually developed by a separate Technical Working Group tasked with a single topic. The groups were a multidisciplinary group of content-area experts from across the United States. The groups included urban and rural jurisdictions as well as Federal agencies representatives. Each participating member was experienced in the area of crime scene investigation and evidence collection in the criminal justice system from the standpoints of law enforcement, prosecution, defense, or forensic science. The Technical Working Groups were designed to be short term in duration to respond to a topic. Longer term groups exist under other organizations such as the FBI&#x27;s Scientific Working Group (SWG&#x27;s) on Digital Evidence.

Technology Working Group topics have included:

During the several years of their existence they developed numerous guides including the following:
* Body armor testing for bulletproofing and stabproofing
* Crime Scene Investigation: A Reference for Law Enforcement (pdf, 60 pages) Published June 2004
* Death Investigation: A Guide for the Scene Investigator (pdf, 72 pages) Published November 1999
* Fire and Arson Scene Evidence: A Guide for Public Safety Personnel (pdf, 73 pages) Published June 2000
* Guide for Explosion and Bombing Scene Investigation (pdf, 64 pages) Published July 2000
* Electronic Crime Scene Investigation: A Guide for First Responders (pdf, 93 pages) First Edition published July 2001; second edition published 2008

<text>Prince Antoine Bibesco (; July 19, 1878 – September 2, 1951) was a Romanian aristocrat, lawyer, diplomat, and writer.

==Biography==
He was born as the son of Prince Alexandre Bibesco, the last surviving son of the &quot;Duke&quot; of Wallachia and his wife, Elena Epureanu, daughter of Manolache Costache Epureanu, former Prime Minister of Romania. Though raised at 69, Rue de Courcelles, in Paris, Antoine continued to oversee the Bibesco estates in Craiova until after World War II.

As a young man, his mother, Princess Hélène Bibesco&#x27;s celebrated Paris salon gave him the opportunity to meet Charles Gounod, Claude Debussy, Camille Saint-Saëns, Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard, Aristide Maillol, Anatole France, and Marcel Proust among many other notables. Both his father and mother commissioned artworks and music (most notably Edgar Degas and George Enescu) and Antoine continued this family tradition, particularly through his friendship with Vuillard.

Marcel Proust became a lifelong friend and shared a secret language in which Marcel was &quot;Lecram&quot; and the Bibescos were &quot;Ocsebib&quot;. Antoine made a concerted effort to have Proust&#x27;s &quot;Du Côté de Chez Swann&quot; (in which, it is said, Bibesco was the model for Robert de St. Loup) published by André Gide and the &quot;Nouvelle Revue Française&quot;, but failed in that effort. Toward the end of Proust&#x27;s life, Bibesco, who was a great raconteur, was an outside ear for the reclusive writer. Later he published &quot;Letters of Marcel Proust to Antoine Bibesco&quot;.
Bibesco, though not a prolific writer, was the author of a number of plays in French and had at least one American success. In 1930 his play &quot;Ladies All&quot; was performed on Broadway at the Morosco Theatre, running for 140 performances. He also translated &quot;Weekend&quot; by Noël Coward and &quot;Le Domaine&quot; by John Galsworthy into French.

==Diplomatic career==
Having earlier served as counsellor of the Romanian legations in Paris and Petrograd, by 1914, Prince Antoine was First Secretary of the Romanian Legation in London and by 1918 had entered the circle of H. H. Asquith (former Liberal Prime Minister). At this time he was in a relationship with the writer Enid Bagnold, but his affections for her were replaced by those he began to feel for the twenty-one-year-old Elizabeth Asquith (he was 40 at the time). 

Margot Asquith, her mother, thought he would be a steadying influence on her daughter. &quot;What a gentleman he is. None of my family are gentlemen like that; no breeding you know,&quot; she wrote.

The marriage took place at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster on 29 April 1919. It was the society event of the year, attended by everyone from Queen Alexandra to George Bernard Shaw. Their only child, Priscilla, was born in London 1920; she died in Paris in 2004.

Apparently marriage did not change Antoine&#x27;s womanizing ways. Rebecca West (with whom he had a short affair in 1927) called him &quot;a boudoir athlete&quot;. While attending a party at the French embassy in London and looking around the room, West realized that every woman in attendance had been his mistress at one time or another.

Antoine continued his diplomatic career in Washington, D.C. (1920–1926) as Minister of the Romanian Legation (the present Embassy of Romania in Washington, D.C. was first used as such during his tenure) and in Madrid (1927–1931).

In 1936, after Romanian Prime Minister Gheorghe Tătărescu removed Nicolae Titulescu as Foreign Minister and recalled nearly all Romania&#x27;s diplomats, Prince Bibesco had the unenviable responsibility of reassuring the United Kingdom and France that Romania was not slipping into the grip of fascism. 

The World War II years were spent in Romania where his wife died (in 1945) and when, after the war, his estates were confiscated by the communists he left his country, never to return. Bagnold, in her autobiography, tells of unwittingly smuggling silver across the English Channel for him after the war. He died in 1951 and was buried in Paris.

&quot;&quot;He had three tombs in his heart&quot;, Enid Bagnold wrote in her &quot;Times&quot; obituary, &quot;which I think he could never finally close—of his mother, his brother Emmanuel and his wife.&quot;&quot;

<text>Consumer Reports (CR), formerly Consumers Union (CU), is an American nonprofit consumer organization dedicated to independent product testing, investigative journalism, consumer-oriented research, public education, and consumer advocacy.

Founded in 1936, CR was created to serve as a source of information that consumers could use to help assess the safety and performance of products. Since that time, CR has continued its testing and analysis of products and services, and attempted to advocate for the consumer in legislative and rule-making areas. Among the reforms in which CR played a role were the advent of seat belt laws, exposure of the dangers of cigarettes, and more recently, the enhancement of consumer finance protection and the increase of consumer access to quality health care. The organization has also expanded its reach to a suite of digital platforms. Consumer Reports Advocacy frequently supports environmental causes, including heightened regulations on auto manufacturers.

The organization&#x27;s headquarters, including its 50 testing labs, are located in Yonkers, New York, while its automotive testing track is in East Haddam, Connecticut. CR is funded by subscriptions to its magazine and website, as well as through independent grants and donations. Marta L. Tellado is the current CEO of Consumer Reports. She joined the organization in 2014, following her work with the Ford Foundation, with the goal of expanding its engagement and advocacy efforts.

Consumer Reports&#x27; flagship website and magazine publishes reviews and comparisons of consumer products and services based on reporting and results from its in-house testing laboratory and survey research center. CR accepts no advertising, pays for all the products it tests, and as a nonprofit organization has no shareholders. It also publishes general and targeted product/service buying guides.

== Advocacy and campaigns ==
Consumer Reports has hundreds of thousands of online advocates who take action and write letters to policymakers about the issues its advocates take on. This group continues to grow as Consumer Reports expands its reach, with 6 million paid members who have access to online tools like a car recall tracker and personalized content. An additional base of online members join for free and received guidance on a range of products (e.g. gas grills, washing machines) at no charge. CR has also launched several advocacy websites, including HearUsNow.org, which helps consumers with telecommunications policy matters. In March 2005, CR campaign PrescriptionforChange.org released &quot;Drugs I Need&quot;, an animated short with a song from the Austin Lounge Lizards, that was featured by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, JibJab, BoingBoing, and hundreds of blogs. On Earth Day 2005, CR launched GreenerChoices.org, a web-based initiative meant to &quot;inform, engage, and empower consumers about environmentally friendly products and practices&quot;.

Consumer Reports was a sponsor of the Safe Patient Project, whose goal was to help consumers find the best quality of health care by promoting the public disclosure of hospital-acquired infection rates and medical errors. The US Centers for Disease Control states that about 2 million patients annually (about 1 in 20) will acquire an infection while being treated in a hospital for an unrelated health care problem, resulting in 99,000 deaths and as much as $45 billion in excess hospital costs.

The campaign has worked in every state calling for legislation requiring hospitals to disclose infection rates to the public. The Safe Patient Project also works on medical devices, prescription drugs, and physician accountability.

GreenerChoices.org offers an &quot;accessible, reliable, and practical source of information on buying &#x27;greener&#x27; products that have minimal environmental impact and meet personal needs&quot;. The site contains many articles about different products, rating them on how &quot;green&quot; they are. It also focuses on electronics and appliance recycling and reuse, as well as conservation and global warming prevention.

Funding for Consumer Reports has recently been provided by USPIRG Education Fund, the Kentucky Equal Justice Center and the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network among other advocacy organizations.

In recent years, the organization has been vocal on key issues, including championing consumer choice and industry competition in the debate against the Sprint T-Mobile merger, advocating for consumer preference to leave net neutrality protections in place, exposing how data is used to engage in racial discrimination when determining consumer pricing offers, and advocating for stronger privacy laws in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.

==Editorial independence==
&quot;Consumer Reports&quot; is well known for its policies on editorial independence, which it says are to &quot;maintain our independence and impartiality ... [so that] CR has no agenda other than the interests of consumers&quot;. &quot;CR&quot; has unusually strict requirements and sometimes has taken extraordinary steps; for example it declined to renew a car dealership&#x27;s bulk subscription because of &quot;the appearance of an impropriety&quot;. However, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; in 2021 took a $375,000 grant from an environmental group, the Climate Imperative Foundation, to examine gas stoves and indoor air quality, which resulted in the publication of an article entitled &quot;Is Your Gas Range a Health Risk?&quot; published on Oct. 4, 2022, with a note indicating that the article was funded in part by a grant from the Climate Imperative Foundation. This article appeared prior to an Oct. 25 memo by Consumer Products Safety Commission Commissioner Richard L. Trumka entitled &#x27;Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to Ban Gas Stoves&#x27;.

&quot;Consumer Reports&quot; does not allow outside advertising in the magazine, but its website has retailers&#x27; advertisements. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; states that PriceGrabber places the ads and pays a percentage of referral fees to &quot;CR&quot;, who has no direct relationship with the retailers. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; publishes reviews of its business partner and recommends it in at least one case. &quot;CR&quot; had a similar relationship with BizRate at one time and has had relationships with other companies including Amazon.com, Yahoo!, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, BillShrink, and Decide.com. &quot;CR&quot; also accepts grants from other organizations.

Consumer Reports says its secret shoppers purchase all tested products at retail prices on behalf of the organization, that they do so anonymously, and that CR accepts no free samples in order to limit bias from bribery and to prevent being given better than average samples. Consumer Reports pays a rental fee to manufacturers when using these press samples and does not include the products in its ratings. For most of &quot;CR&quot;″s history, it minimized contact with government and industry experts &quot;to avoid compromising the independence of its judgment&quot;. In 2007, in response to errors in infant car seat testing, it began accepting advice from a wide range of experts on designing tests, but not on final assessments. Also, at times &quot;CR&quot; allows manufacturers to review and respond to criticism before publication. CR also accepts referral fees from websites such as Amazon for including &quot;affiliate links&quot; to websites where customers can purchase reviewed products.

Some objective and comparative tests published by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; are carried out under the umbrella of the international consumer organization International Consumer Research &amp; Testing. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; also uses outside labs for testing, including for 11 percent of tests in 2006.

==Publications==
ConsumerReports.org, the website of Consumer Reports, is largely available only to paid subscribers. ConsumerReports.org provides updates on product availability, and adds new products to previously published test results. In addition, the online data includes coverage that is not published in the magazine; for example, vehicle reliability (frequency of repair) tables online extend over the full 10 model years reported in the Annual Questionnaires, whereas the magazine has only a six-year history of each model.

In 1990, Consumer Reports launched &quot;Consumer Reports Television&quot;. By March 2005 it was &quot;hosted&quot; by over 100 stations.

On August 1, 2006, Consumer Reports launched &quot;ShopSmart&quot;, a magazine aimed at young women.

In 2008, Consumer Reports acquired &quot;The Consumerist&quot; blog from Gawker Media.

Magazine copies distributed in Canada include a small four-page supplement called &quot;Canada Extra&quot;, explaining how the magazine&#x27;s findings apply to that country and lists the examined items available there.

In 1998, Consumer Reports launched the grant-funded project &quot;Consumer Reports WebWatch&quot;, which aimed to improve the credibility of Web sites through investigative reporting, publicizing best-practices standards, and publishing a list of sites that comply with the standards. WebWatch worked with the Stanford Web Credibility Project, Harvard University&#x27;s Berkman Center, The Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, and others. WebWatch is a member of ICANN, the W3C and the Internet Society. Its content is free. As of July 31, 2009, WebWatch has been shut down, though the site is still available.

&quot;Consumer Reports Best Buy Drugs&quot; is available free on Consumer Reports Health.org. It compares prescription drugs in over 20 major categories, such as heart disease, blood pressure and diabetes, and gives comparative ratings of effectiveness and costs, in reports and tables, in web pages and PDF documents, in summary and detailed form.

Also in 2005 Consumer Reports launched the service &quot;Greener Choices&quot;, which is meant to &quot;inform, engage, and empower consumers about environmentally-friendly products and practices&quot;. It contains information about conservation, electronics recycling and conservation with the goal or providing an &quot;accessible, reliable, and practical source of information on buying &quot;greener&quot; products that have minimal environmental impact and meet personal needs&quot;.

Consumer Reports published a kids&#x27; version of &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; called &quot;Penny Power&quot; in 1980, later changed in August 1990 to &quot;Zillions&quot;. This publication was similar to &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; but served a younger audience. At its peak, the magazine covered close to 350,000 subscribers. It gave children financial advice for budgeting their allowances and saving for a big purchase, reviewed kid-oriented consumer products (e.g., toys, clothes, electronics, food, videogames, etc.), and generally promoted smart consumerism in kids and teens; testing of products came from kids of the age range a product was targeted toward. It also taught kids about deceitful marketing practices practiced by advertising agencies. The magazine folded in 2000.

Consumer Reports had an annual testing budget of approximately US$25 million, as well as approximately 7 million subscribers (3.8 million print and 3.2 million digital) as of April 2016.

The organization had around 6 million members in July 2018.

== History ==

=== Founding and early years ===
In 1927, F.J. Schlink and Stuart Chase published their best selling novel, &quot;Your Money&#x27;s Worth&quot;, which saw massive readership due to the consumer movement. The demand for brand research led to Schlink to found the company &quot;Consumers&#x27; Research&quot; in 1927. The company was responsible for publishing Consumers’ Research Bulletin (previously named Consumer Club Commodity List). The subscriber count in 1933 was reported to be over 42,000. It was in this year, that Consumer Research moved its operations to New York City. Following this move, employees began to unionize, citing unfair pay. Schlink proceeded to fire the strikers. The former Consumers&#x27; Research employees, teamed up with &quot;journalists, engineers, academics, and scientists&quot; to found the company &quot;Consumers Union&quot;—now known as Consumer Reports—in February 1936. Consumers Union differentiated themselves from Consumers&#x27; Research by establishing a community amongst readers. Within the overall mission of creating more informed consumers, Consumers Union united with women&#x27;s clubs and citizen groups, creating a progressive message. Consumers Union would surpass Schlink&#x27;s Consumers&#x27; Research in subscribers by 1940, accumulating a readership of 71,000.

=== Resistance ===
Numerous businesses and corporations set out to suppress the actions of Consumers Union. In an effort to suppress the critiques of Consumers&#x27; Union, The New York Herald Tribune established an institute with the goal of demonstrating that the efforts of consumers groups were futile, in that businesses already conducted extensive product-testing. The Crowell Institute on Consumer Relations founded in 1937, sprouted from the forum Woman&#x27;s Home Companion, which had a readership of 2 million. The institute suppressed the efforts of consumer groups by giving business and advertisers the platform to putdown the consumers&#x27; pursuit of &quot;lower distribution costs, grade labeling, and regulation,&quot; asserting that these businesses were already taking these factors into account. The New York Times proved to be an obstacle for Consumers Union, refusing CU&#x27;s requests to advertise. Other major publications would follow suit.

In the year 1938, CU would find itself at the center of The Dies Committee&#x27;s investigation into &quot;unpatriotic propaganda&quot;. The committee brought on former member of Consumers&#x27; Research&#x27; board, J.B. Matthews as its research director. In Matthews&#x27; official report, he accused CU and its CEO Arthur Kallet of holding Communist ideals, and going as far as to label CU as &quot;Communist front&quot;. The smear campaign was criticized by Consumers Union for its lack of legitimacy. The allegations proved fruitless, and rather served to delegitimize Consumers&#x27; Research and Congressman Dies. In part due to actions of Consumers&#x27; Research, the House Un-American Activities Committee placed Consumers Union on a list of subversive organizations, only to remove it in 1954.

=== Role in consumer movement ===
Consumers Union established themselves as an advocate for consumer rights during the interwar years. The rise of Consumers Union happened simultaneously with women&#x27;s groups interest in consumption. Despite the mobilization of citizens interested in consumption, the pursuit of consumer rights were not validated until the New Deal. The programs represented an acknowledgment of the consumer movement, by actively working to improve consumer purchaser power.

In World War II, Consumer Union took a stance in support of the war effort. The urged their supporters to put aside their personal interest by consuming less, and following the government ordered policies of consumption. They were also critical of businesses who saw the war period as an opportunity to advertise their products and as a result were wasting paper. The government&#x27;s vested interest in the politics of consumption would escalate in the postwar period. Government would encourage to consume both through propaganda as well as the protections instituted to promote individual consumption.

Consumer Reports has helped start several consumer groups and publications, in 1960 helping create global consumer group Consumers International and in 1974 providing financial assistance to Consumers&#x27; Checkbook which is considered akin to &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; for local services in the seven metropolitan areas they serve.

=== Other organizational maneuvers ===
Prominent consumer advocate Ralph Nader was on the board of directors, but left in 1975 due to a &quot;division of philosophy&quot; with new Executive Director Rhoda Karpatkin. Nader wanted Consumer Reports to focus on policy and product advocacy, while Karpatkin focused on product testing. Karpatkin was appointed executive director in 1974 and retired as president in the early 2000s.

At the start of 2009, Consumer Reports acquired &quot;The Consumerist&quot; blog from Gawker Media for approximately $600,000.

Prior to 2012, the organization did business as Consumers Union. The reason for the name change was that the name of &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; was more familiar to the public than the name of &quot;Consumers Union&quot;.

Consumer Reports spent $200,000 on lobbying in 2015.

The Consumerist was subsequently closed in December 2017, when its content was folded into the Consumer Reports website.

== Product changes after &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; tests ==

In the July 1978 issue, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; rated the Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon automobile &quot;not acceptable&quot;, the first car it had judged such since the AMC Ambassador in 1968. In its testing they found the possibility of these models&#x27; developing an oscillatory yaw as a result of a sudden violent input to the steering; the manufacturer claimed: &quot;Some do, some don&#x27;t&quot; show this behavior, but it has no &quot;validity in the real world of driving&quot;. Nevertheless, the next year, these models included a lighter weight steering wheel rim and a steering damper, and &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; reported that the previous instability was no longer present.

In a 2003 issue of &quot;CR&quot;, the magazine tested the Nissan Murano crossover utility vehicle and did not recommend the vehicle because of a problem with its power steering, even though the vehicle had above-average reliability. The specific problem was that the steering would stiffen substantially on hard turning. &quot;CR&quot; recommended the 2005 model, which had addressed this problem.

BMW changed the software for the stability control in its X5 SUV after replicating a potential rollover problem discovered during a &quot;CR&quot; test.

In 2010, &quot;CR&quot; rated the 2010 Lexus GX 460 SUV unsafe after the vehicle failed one of the magazine&#x27;s emergency safety tests. Toyota temporarily suspended sales of the vehicle, and after conducting its own test acknowledged the problem and issued a recall for the vehicle, which later passed a &quot;CR&quot; re-test.

In 2016, &quot;CR &quot;found wildly inconsistent battery life in its testing of Apple&#x27;s 2016 MacBook Pro. This led to the discovery of a bug in the Safari web browser, which Apple promptly fixed via a software update.

In May 2018, &quot;CR&quot; said it could not recommend the Tesla Model 3 due to concerns about the car&#x27;s long stopping distance. Within days, Tesla issued a remote software update. &quot;CR&quot; retested the car&#x27;s brakes, then gave the Model 3 a &quot;recommended&quot; rating.

==Lawsuits against Consumer Reports==
Consumer Reports has been sued several times by companies unhappy with reviews of their products. Consumer Reports has fought these cases vigorously. As of October 2000, Consumer Reports had been sued by 13 manufacturers and never lost a case.

===Bose===
In 1971, Bose Corporation sued &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; (&quot;CR&quot;) for libel after &quot;CR&quot; reported in a review that the sound from the system it reviewed &quot;tended to wander about the room&quot;. The case eventually reached the United States Supreme Court, which affirmed in &quot;Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.&quot; that &quot;CR&quot; statement was made without actual malice and therefore was not libelous.

===Suzuki===

In 1988, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; announced during a press conference that the Suzuki Samurai had demonstrated a tendency to roll and deemed it &quot;not acceptable&quot;. Suzuki sued in 1996 after the Samurai was again mentioned in a &quot;CR&quot; anniversary issue. In July 2004, after eight years in court, the suit was settled and dismissed with no money changing hands and no retraction issued, but &quot;Consumers Union&quot; did agree to no longer refer to the 16-year-old test results of the 1988 Samurai in its advertising or promotional materials.

===Rivera Isuzu===
In December 1997, the Isuzu Trooper distributor in Puerto Rico sued &quot;CR&quot;, alleging that it had lost sales as a result of disparagement of the Trooper by the Consumers Union of the United States (CU). A trial court granted the motion for summary judgment by the CU, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the favorable judgment.

===Sharper Image===
In 2003, Sharper Image sued &quot;CR&quot; in California for product disparagement over negative reviews of its Ionic Breeze Quadra air purifier. &quot;CR&quot; moved for dismissal on October 31, 2003, and the case was dismissed in November 2004. The decision also awarded &quot;CR&quot; $525,000 in legal fees and costs.

==Controversy over child safety seats==
The February 2007 issue of &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; stated that only two of the child safety seats it tested for that issue passed the organization&#x27;s side impact tests. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which subsequently retested the seats, found that all those seats passed the corresponding NHTSA tests at the speeds described in the magazine report. The &quot;CR&quot; article reported that the tests simulated the effects of collisions at 38.5 mph. However, the tests that were completed in fact simulated collisions at 70 mph. &quot;CR&quot; stated in a letter from its president Jim Guest to its subscribers that it would retest the seats. The article was removed from the &quot;CR&quot; website, and on January 18, 2007, the organization posted a note on its home page about the misleading tests. Subscribers were also sent a postcard apologizing for the error. On January 28, 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an op-ed from Joan Claybrook, who served on the board of CR from 1982 to 2006 and was the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from 1977 to 1981, where she discussed the sequence of events leading to the publishing of the erroneous information.

==Other errors or issues==
In February 1998, the organization tested pet food and claimed that Iams dog food was nutritionally deficient. It later retracted the report claiming that there had been &quot;a systemic error in the measurements of various minerals we tested – potassium, calcium and magnesium&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; said six hybrid vehicles would probably not save owners money. The organization later discovered that it had miscalculated depreciation and released an update stating that four of the six vehicles would save the buyers money if the vehicles were kept for five years (and received the federal tax credit for hybrid vehicles, which expired after each manufacturer sold 60,000 hybrid vehicles).

== Graphs ==

&quot;Consumer Reports&quot; graphs formerly used a modified form of Harvey balls for qualitative comparison. The round ideograms were arranged from best to worst. On the left of the diagram, the red circle indicated the highest rating, the half red and white circle was the second highest rating, the white circle was neutral, the half black circle was the second-lowest rating, and the entirely black circle was the lowest rating possible.

As part of a wider rebranding of &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; in September 2016, the appearance of the magazine&#x27;s rating system was significantly revamped. The Harvey balls were replaced with new color-coded circles: green for excellent; lime green for very good; yellow for good; orange for fair; and red for poor. It was stated that this new system will help improve the clarity of ratings tables by using a &quot;universally understood&quot; metaphor.

<text>Founded in 1959 and published by Consumers Digest Communications, LLC, Consumers Digest was an American magazine. It was based in Chicago. The last issue was published in February 2019.

The magazine had no subscribers and did not test the products they select as &#x27;Best Buys&#x27;. Instead, companies paid &quot;Consumers Digest&quot; for the right to promote their products as &#x27;Best Buys&#x27;. They relied on consumer confusion of their name with the well-known &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; magazine, published by the nonprofit organization Consumers Union. Consumers Digest Communications is a privately owned, for-profit business entity.

==History==
The magazine was sold at newsstands only and did not reveal its sales figures. In 2001, when it ceased subscription distribution, it listed 700,000 subscribers (the list was sold to Time, Inc.). The publication has no connection with the &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; magazine or with &quot;Consumers Digest Weekly&quot;. It was possible to subscribe to the on-line edition of &quot;Consumers Digest&quot;.

==Controversy==
&quot;Consumers Digest&quot; had a history of not paying its contributors. In an October 30, 2017, article published by &quot;Talking Biz News&quot; (TBN), it was reported that at least three journalists were suing the company run by publisher Randy Weber for nonpayment. Two other journalists also shared their attempts to collect on what was owed them.

As of February 2019, following multiple, additional lawsuits from 2018, it appeared the company had closed down, as the website no longer was active and the company phone number was disconnected.

<text>The Aspen Movie Map was a hypermedia system developed at MIT that enabled the user to take a virtual tour through the city of Aspen, Colorado. It was developed by a team working with Andrew Lippman in 1978 with funding from ARPA.

==Features==
The Aspen Movie Map enabled the user to take a virtual tour through the city of Aspen, Colorado (that is, a form of surrogate travel). It is an early example of a hypermedia system.

A gyroscopic stabilizer with four 16mm stop-frame film cameras was mounted on top of a car with an encoder that triggered the cameras every ten feet. The distance was measured from an optical sensor attached to the hub of a bicycle wheel dragged behind the vehicle. The cameras were mounted in order to capture front, back, and side views as the car made its way through the city. Filming took place daily between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. to minimize lighting discrepancies. The car was carefully driven down the center of every street in Aspen to enable registered match cuts.

The film was assembled into a collection of discontinuous scenes (one segment per view per city block) and then transferred to laserdisc, the analog-video precursor to modern digital optical disc storage technologies such as DVDs. A database was made that correlated the layout of the video on the disc with the two-dimensional street plan. Thus linked, the user was able to choose an arbitrary path through the city; the only restrictions being the necessity to stay in the center of the street; move ten feet between steps; and view the street from one of the four orthogonal views.

The interaction was controlled through a dynamically generated menu overlaid on top of the video image: speed and viewing angle were modified by the selection of the appropriate icon through a touch-screen interface, harbinger of the ubiquitous interactive-video kiosk. Commands were sent from the client process handling the user input and overlay graphics to a server that accessed the database and controlled the laserdisc players. Another interface feature was the ability to touch any building in the current field of view, and, in a manner similar to the ISMAP feature of web browsers, jump to a façade of that building. Selected buildings contained additional data: e.g., interior shots, historical images, menus of restaurants, video interviews of city officials, etc., allowing the user to take a virtual tour through those buildings.

In a later implementation, the metadata, which was in large part automatically extracted from the animation database, was encoded as a digital signal in the analog video. The data encoded in each frame contained all the necessary information to enable a full-featured surrogate-travel experience.

Another feature of the system was a navigation map that was overlaid above the horizon in the top of the frame; the map both served to indicate the user&#x27;s current position in the city (as well as a trace of streets previously explored) and to allow the user to jump to a two-dimensional city map, which allowed for an alternative way of moving through the city. Additional features of the map interface included the ability to jump back and forth between correlated aerial photographic and cartoon renderings with routes and landmarks highlighted; and to zoom in and out à la Charles Eames&#x27;s &quot;Powers of Ten&quot; film.

Aspen was filmed in early fall and winter. The user was able to &quot;in situ&quot; change seasons on demand while moving down the street or looking at a façade. A three-dimensional polygonal model of the city was also generated, using the Quick and Dirty Animation System (QADAS), which featured three-dimensional texture-mapping of the facades of landmark buildings, using an algorithm designed by Paul Heckbert. These computer-graphic images, also stored on the laserdisc, were also correlated to the video, enabling the user to view an abstract rendering of the city in real time.

==Credits==
MIT undergraduate Peter Clay, with help from Bob Mohl and Michael Naimark, filmed the hallways of MIT with a camera mounted on a cart. The film was transferred to a laserdisc as part of a collection of projects being done at the Architecture Machine Group (ArcMac).

The Aspen Movie Map was filmed in the fall of 1978, in winter 1979 and briefly again (with an active gyro stabilizer) in the fall of 1979. The first version was operational in early spring of 1979.

Many people were involved in the production, most notably: Nicholas Negroponte, founder and director of the Architecture Machine Group, who found support for the project from the Cybernetics Technology Office of DARPA; Andrew Lippman, principal investigator; Bob Mohl, who designed the map overlay system and ran user studies of the efficacy of the system for his PhD thesis; Richard Leacock (Ricky), who headed the MIT Film/Video section and shot along with MS student Marek Zalewski the Cinéma vérité interviews placed behind the facades of key buildings; John Borden, of Peace River Films in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who designed the stabilization rig; Kristina Hooper Woolsey of UCSC; Rebecca Allen; Scott Fisher, who matched the photos of Aspen in the silver-mining days from the historical society to the same scenes in Aspen in 1978 and who experimented with anamorphic imaging of the city (using a Volpe lens); Walter Bender, who designed and built the interface, the client/server model, and the animation system; Steve Gregory; Stan Sasaki, who built much of the electronics; Steve Yelick, who worked on the laserdisc interface and anamorphic rendering; Eric &quot;Smokehouse&quot; Brown, who built the metadata encoder/decoder; Paul Heckbert worked on the animation system; Mark Shirley and Paul Trevithick, who also worked on the animation; Ken Carson; Howard Eglowstein; and Michael Naimark, who was at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies and was responsible for the cinematography design and production.

The Ramtek 9000 series image display system was used for this project. Ramtek created a 32 bit interface to the Interdata for this purpose. Ramtek supplied image display systems which supplied square displays (256x256 or 512x512) as its competition did but also screen matches such as 320x240, 640x512 and 1280x1024. The original GE CAT Scanners all used the Ramtek 320x240 display. Some prices of the day may be of interest. A keyboard, joystick or trackball would each sell for around $1,200. A 19&quot; CRT had an OEM price of around $5,000 and this would be purchased from Igagami in Japan. The production of a single CD master (around 13&quot;) was $300,000.

==Purpose and applications==
ARPA funding during the late 1970s was subject to the military application requirements of the Mansfield Amendment introduced by Mike Mansfield (which had severely limited funding for hypertext researchers like Douglas Engelbart).

The Aspen Movie Map&#x27;s military application was to solve the problem of quickly familiarizing soldiers with new territory. The Department of Defense had been deeply impressed by the success of Operation Entebbe in 1976, where the Israeli commandos had quickly built a crude replica of the airport and practiced in it before attacking the real thing. DOD hoped that the Movie Map would show the way to a future where computers could instantly create a three-dimensional simulation of a hostile environment at much lower cost and in less time (see virtual reality).

While the Movie Map has been referred to as an early example of interactive video, it is perhaps more accurate to describe it as a pioneering example of interactive computing. Video, audio, still images and metadata were retrieved from a database and assembled on the fly by the computer (an Interdata minicomputer running the MagicSix operating system) redirecting its actions based upon user input; video was the principal, but not sole affordance of the interaction.

<text>A crash test is a form of destructive testing usually performed in order to ensure safe design standards in crashworthiness and crash compatibility for various modes of transportation (see automobile safety) or related systems and components.

== Types ==
* Frontal-impact tests: which is what most people initially think of when asked about a crash test. Vehicles usually impact a solid concrete wall at a specified speed, but these can also be vehicle impacting vehicle tests. SUVs have been singled out in these tests for a while, due to the high ride-height that they often have.
* Moderate Overlap tests: in which only part of the front of the car impacts with a barrier (vehicle). These are important, as impact forces (approximately) remain the same as with a frontal impact test, but a smaller fraction of the car is required to absorb all of the force. These tests are often realized by cars turning into oncoming traffic. This type of testing is done by the U.S.A. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), Euro NCAP, Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) and ASEAN NCAP.
* Small Overlap tests: this is where only a small portion of the car&#x27;s structure strikes an object such as a pole or a tree, or if a car were to clip another car. This is the most demanding test because it loads the most force onto the structure of the car at any given speed. These are usually conducted at 15–20% of the front vehicle structure.
* Side-impact tests: these forms of accidents have a very significant likelihood of fatality, as cars do not have a significant crumple zone to absorb the impact forces before an occupant is injured.
*Pole-impact tests: A difficult test which places a large amount of force on a small proportion on the side of the vehicle.
* Roll-over tests: which tests a car&#x27;s ability (specifically the pillars holding the roof) to support itself in a dynamic impact. More recently, dynamic rollover tests have been proposed in lieu of static crush testing (video).
* Roadside hardware crash tests: are used to ensure crash barriers and crash cushions will protect vehicle occupants from roadside hazards, and also to ensure that guard rails, sign posts, light poles and similar appurtenances do not pose an undue hazard to vehicle occupants.
* Old versus new: Often an old and big car against a small and new car, or two different generations of the same car model. These tests are performed to show the advancements in crash-worthiness.
* Computer model: Because of the cost of full-scale crash tests, engineers often run many simulated crash tests using computer models to refine their vehicle or barrier designs before conducting live tests.
* Sled testing: A cost-effective way of testing components such as airbags and seat belts is conducting sled crash testing. The two most common types of sled systems are reverse-firing sleds which are fired from a standstill, and decelerating sleds which are accelerated from a starting point and stopped in the crash area with a hydraulic ram. It can also be used to evaluate the whiplash protection of a vehicle&#x27;s seat.

== Major providers==


* Auto Review Car Assessment Program (ARCAP)
* Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club (ADAC) in Germany
* National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the United States, specifically the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) and New Car Assessment Program (NCAP)

== Data collection ==

Crash tests are conducted under rigorous scientific and safety standards. Each crash test is very expensive so the maximum amount of data must be extracted from each test. Usually, this requires the use of high-speed data-acquisition, at least one accelerometer and a crash test dummy, but often includes more.

Some organizations that conduct crash tests include Calspan, an independent test laboratory in Buffalo, NY. As a result of the capabilities and expertise at Calspan, Calspan has been awarded 5 year contracts by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to execute for the NHTSA FMVSS No. 214, Side Impact Protection Compliance Testing, FMVSS No. 301 Fuel System Integrity, and FMVSS No. 305 Electric Powered Vehicles: Electrolyte Spillage and Electrical Shock Protection vehicle crash tests. Calspan also holds the NHTSA contracts for executing New Car Assessment Program crash tests.

Also, the Monash University department of civil engineering routinely conducts crash tests for the purposes of roadside barrier safety and design.

== Consumer response ==
* In 1998 the Rover 100 received a one-star Adult Occupant Rating in EuroNCAP crash tests; sales promptly collapsed and the 18-year-old design was quickly scrapped.
* In 2005 the Daewoo Kalos made news in Europe and Australia by scoring only two stars in its crash test, resulting in lower sales and demonstrating the influence of vehicle crashworthiness on a model&#x27;s success in the marketplace. The result for Holden in Australia, who retailed the Kalos under the Holden Barina name, resulted in a considerable amount of negative publicity, with the managing director of Holden forced to publicly defend the vehicle.
* The second generation Isuzu Trooper (1995–1997) models were rated &quot;Not Acceptable&quot; by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; for their tendency to &quot;roll over&quot; during testing. After the report Trooper sales never recovered and two years later production ceased.

== Crash testing programs==
There are a number of crash test programs around the world dedicated to providing consumers with a source of comparitative information in relation to the safety performance of new and used vehicles. Examples of new car crash test programs include National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#x27;s NCAP, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Australasian New Car Assessment Program, EuroNCAP and JapNCAP. Programs such as the Used Car Safety Ratings provide consumers information on the safety performance of vehicles based on real world crash data.

In 2020, EuroNCAP introduces a &quot;mobile progressive deformable barrier (MPDB) test&quot; first experimented on the Toyota Yaris.

<doc id="286323" wikidata="Q277715" url="?curid=286323" title="Crash Test Dummies">
<text>Crash Test Dummies are a Canadian rock band from Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Anchored by Brad Roberts (vocals, guitar) and his distinctive bass-baritone voice, the other band members have fluctuated over the years. Its most prominent line-up consisted of Roberts, Ellen Reid (co-vocals, keyboards), Brad&#x27;s brother Dan Roberts (bass guitar, backing vocals), Benjamin Darvill (harmonica, mandolin), and Mitch Dorge (drums, percussion). 

The band is widely known internationally for their 1993 single &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; and in Canada for the 1991 single &quot;Superman&#x27;s Song&quot;.

==History==
===Beginnings: 1988–1991===

The origin of Crash Test Dummies is tied to the history of two Winnipeg nightspots, the Spectrum Cabaret and the Blue Note Cafe, owned by Curtis Riddell.

In 1986, Riddell joined with Brad Roberts to form the decidedly less-than-serious bar band Bad Brad Roberts and the St. James Rhythm Pigs. Over time, the band evolved into Crash Test Dummies, a name suggested by a friend of the band who was in medical school. The diagnostic mannequin, known colloquially as a crash test dummy, was known to the public already by this time. The band adopted the name as a joke, but nevertheless kept it. Ellen Reid and Benjamin Darvill became permanent additions. George West, the original bass player, quit and was replaced by Dan Roberts, Brad&#x27;s brother. Riddell was replaced by Vince Lambert, who was replaced by Mitch Dorge just before the release of &quot;The Ghosts That Haunt Me&quot;.

After signing with BMG Records in 1991, the band signed with manager Jeff Rogers (Swell) who managed the band until the end of 1999 when he left to become Head of Artist Development at Richard Branson&#x27;s V2 Records.

===Mainstream success: 1991–1999===
The band first began to achieve commercial success in Canada with the release of &quot;The Ghosts that Haunt Me&quot; in 1991. The album eventually reached sales of 400,000 in Canada, largely due to the popularity of the hit single &quot;Superman&#x27;s Song&quot;, which appeared on the RPM Top Singles chart that year, featured on the soundtrack of an episode of the TV series &quot;Due South&quot; and earned the band the 1992 Juno Award for Group of the Year.

The band did not receive much international recognition until the 1993 release of their second album, &quot;God Shuffled His Feet&quot;.
Particularly instrumental in increasing the band&#x27;s exposure in the American market was the appearance of a new type of radio format, adult album-oriented alternative rock (AAA). These stations put the first single, &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot;, in high rotation and the song peaked at No. 4 on the US Hot 100. &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; did even better in the United Kingdom, where it was a No. 2 hit, and Australia where it peaked at No. 1. Popular parodist &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic parodied the song under the title &quot;Headline News&quot; in 1994.

In their native Canada, &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; was a comparative disappointment on the charts, only peaking at No. 14. Two other songs from the album went top 10 in Canada: &quot;Swimming In Your Ocean&quot; and &quot;Afternoons &amp; Coffeespoons&quot;. This latter song was also a top 40 hit in Australia and the United Kingdom and hit the lower portion of the US Hot 100. The result was that by mid-1994 the album had passed the platinum sales mark (one million) in the United States and had also earned the band three Grammy nominations and three more Juno nominations. To date, &quot;God Shuffled His Feet&quot; has sold more than five and a half million copies worldwide.

In January 1995, the band released &quot;The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead&quot; (a cover of XTC&#x27;s 1992 track) as a single and on the soundtrack of the Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels comedy &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;. The single, credited to &quot;The Crash Test Dummies and Ellen Reid&quot;, charted at No. 30 in the UK singles chart and was a No. 4 hit in Canada.

In 1996, the Dummies&#x27; third album, &quot;A Worm&#x27;s Life&quot;, was released to mixed critical and moderate commercial success. The guitar-heavy singles were warmly received in some markets. Lead single &quot;He Liked to Feel It&quot; hit No. 2 in Canada, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in their home country, but internationally nothing matched the runaway success of either &quot;Superman&#x27;s Song&quot; or &quot;Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot;. Regardless, the album went platinum in Canada in less than one month. 

&quot;Give Yourself A Hand&quot;, the Dummies&#x27; fourth album, was released March 23, 1999. The album was recorded in Nassau, Bahamas, at Compass Point Studios and produced by Greg Wells. It showcased a new sound for the Dummies, as it featured Ellen Reid singing lead vocals on three tracks, and Brad Roberts singing in a falsetto on several others. The whole sound of the album was much more electronic than the previous recordings. Once again, the lead single (&quot;Keep A Lid On Things&quot;) was a top 10 hit in Canada.

During a hiatus between albums, Benjamin Darvill became the first Dummy to release solo material. Under the name Son Of Dave, Darvill first brought out the album &quot;B. Darvill&#x27;s Wild West Show&quot;, followed with &quot;O1&quot;, both released on his own label, Husky Records.

===Post-mainstream career: 2000–2006===
The less-than-stellar commercial success of both &quot;A Worm&#x27;s Life&quot; and &quot;Give Yourself a Hand&quot; resulted in the band feeling much more restricted by their label BMG, especially after the label rejected 35 songs during the production of &quot;Give Yourself a Hand&quot;. As a result, the band and the label parted ways, and Brad Roberts formed his own independent label &quot;Cha-Ching Records&quot; (later renamed to &quot;Deep Fried Records&quot;).

Free from major-label restrictions, the Dummies surprised their fans in 2001 by putting their solo projects on hold for a fifth studio album and tour. After suffering a near-fatal car accident in the fall of 2000, Brad found himself recuperating in the town of Argyle, Nova Scotia. It was there that he met some local &quot;lobster fishermen&quot; who happened to be quite musically inclined – Kent Greene, Dave Morton, and Danny MacKenzie. Together, they recorded the bulk of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care That You Don&#x27;t Mind&quot;, which was to have been Brad&#x27;s first solo album. Later on, Ellen was brought in to record backing vocals for a few tunes, and Dan agreed to tour with Brad. When Ellen and Mitch agreed to tour as well, the Crash Test Dummies name was put on the record. This album saw the Dummies returning to their acoustic roots. Brad compared this album to the Dummies&#x27; first, &quot;The Ghosts That Haunt Me&quot;, though he calls it more atmospheric and polished.

Near the end of 2001, some new Dummies solo albums were released. First, Ellen Reid launched her debut solo effort, &quot;Cinderellen&quot;.

Soon after, Brad Roberts&#x27; long-awaited double-live CD and rockumentary, entitled &quot;Crash Test Dude&quot;, were made available through MapleMusic.

Mitch Dorge&#x27;s surprise debut album, &quot;As Trees Walking&quot;, was released in early 2002. He played almost all of the instruments, took some of the photos for the liner notes, and won a Prairie Music Award for Best Instrumental Recording.

Brad, Dan, and Ellen returned as Crash Test Dummies at the end of 2002 with &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;, a long-rumoured Christmas album.

In 2003, &quot;Puss &#x27;n&#x27; Boots&quot; was released. Much like &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;, the album began life as a Brad Roberts solo project. Co-written by Stuart Cameron, 13 songs were selected from a pool of 30. Ellen sang backing vocals and Dan played bass, though much of the music – funky grooves that would not have seemed out of place on &quot;Give Yourself A Hand&quot; – was performed by other musicians.

&quot;Songs of the Unforgiven&quot;, the eighth studio album under the Crash Test Dummies name, was recorded not long after &quot;Puss &#x27;n&#x27; Boots&quot;.

=== Hiatus, &quot;Oooh La La&quot; 2006–2014 ===
After releasing three records through his own label, Roberts realized he was losing money. As such, he stopped recording and touring and instead worked as a songwriting teacher in New York City, while participating in yoga, chanting, and meditation (the latter influencing Roberts&#x27;s side-project Satsang Circus).

Despite the hiatus, in 2006 Brad Roberts began to record the album that would become &quot;Oooh La La&quot; with producer and friend Stewart Lerman, using the optigan and omnichord.

In October, 2007 Sony BMG released The Best of Crash Test Dummies, featuring twelve tracks selected from the band&#x27;s entire catalog, including most of their singles and several album tracks. The compilation would later be re-released on March 10, 2008, as &quot;Best of Crash Test Dummies – Collections&quot; with two previously unreleased tracks: &quot;Laid Back&quot; and &quot;You Said You&#x27;d Meet Me (In California)&quot;, the latter being an early version of a song that would later appear on &quot;Oooh La La&quot;.

In addition a new online store was opened allowing users to purchase downloads from all of the band&#x27;s post-BMG releases, including Cape Breton Lobster Bash series, a collection of songs written about Brad Roberts&#x27;s experiences at Cape Breton and an annual tradition known as the &quot;Lobster Bash&quot;.

Work continued in 2008 on songs for an album which was tentatively titled &quot;Toys&quot;.
In July 2009, the title of the album was renamed from &quot;Toys&quot; to &quot;Oooh La La&quot;.

A fourth song in the Cape Breton Lobster Bash series was released on July 27, 2009.

&quot;Oooh La La&quot; was released on May 11, 2010. The album&#x27;s release was accompanied by the band touring in an &quot;Acoustic Trio&quot; format consisting of Roberts and Ellen Reid, accompanied by either Stuart Cameron or Murray Pulver on guitar. On October 9, 2010, as part of the Canadian leg of the tour, Dan Roberts and Mitch Dorge joined Brad Roberts and Ellen Reid in the band&#x27;s hometown of Winnipeg for the first performance by the original line-up in a decade. Benjamin Darvill was not present for the reunion, despite having played a solo show in town a few days earlier. During the tour, Brad Roberts began the habit of taking photographs at random and posting them on his blog and the band&#x27;s Facebook page.

In 2011, the band continued to tour in support of &quot;Oooh La La&quot;. On April 19, 2011, the band released &quot;Demo-litions: Cast-off Recordings 1996–97&quot; featuring previously unreleased demos of songs written during the recording of &quot;Give Yourself a Hand&quot;.

In June 2012, Brad Roberts wrote a blog post saying that there is an incomplete new album lying around, but that producer Stewart Lerman is currently too busy with other projects to work on it.

== &quot;Promised Land&quot; 2014–2017 ==
In 2014, Marc Mysterio helped form a new lineup with Roberts and Mark Crozer from Jesus and Mary Chain. This led to the release of the re-vamped lineup&#x27;s debut single &quot;Promised Land&quot;, featuring both Marc Mysterio and Brad Roberts on lead vocals, with Mark Crozer on Bass and Drums. Mysterio wrote, composed and produced the song as well as playing guitar and keyboard on the record. Proceeds went to benefit the International Red Cross to assist with the unprecedented refugee crisis in Europe.

Brad Roberts of Crash Test Dummies described how the new group came to be to scores of media outlets, &quot;Marc Mysterio and I shared a few common friends and when his deal with Godsmack fell through, I stepped up to record the new song. In studio, Marc asked me to add in humming to the track and then after, my wife commented, &#x27;Marc is really on to something there&#x27;&quot;.

&quot;Promised Land&quot; went on to score a Top 10 on radio in United States.

=== Second hiatus, solo tour, side projects: 2015–2016 ===
Following the completion of touring for &quot;Oooh La La&quot;, the band went on an indefinite hiatus, as Ellen Reid decided to retire from performing and Brad Roberts began to develop back problems. However, the hiatus was ended when Brad Roberts decided to go on a solo tour in 2015.

In the spring of 2016, Brad Roberts announced his first tour of Canada in five years. In an interview about the tour, Roberts provided an update about the other members of the band, who he still keeps in touch with: Dan Roberts now has a family in Winnipeg, Mitch Dorge devotes most of his time now to motivational speaking at schools, Ellen Reid is married and spends her time creating elaborate Facebook pages with all her own illustrations, and Benjamin Darvill has found success for himself as Son of Dave. Roberts confirmed that he is the last remaining active member of Crash Test Dummies, with it just being him and guitarist Stuart Cameron going on tour.

On May 28, 2016, to commemorate his first Canadian tour in five years, Brad Roberts released the new song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Peaceful Then&quot;.

=== Full band reunion and nostalgia tours: 2017–present ===
In the summer of 2017, the full band, except for Benjamin Darvill, reunited for a show in Winnipeg and Brad Roberts went on a tour of South Africa in early 2018. The band continued to perform together that summer, including a stop at Ontario&#x27;s Burl&#x27;s Creek Event Grounds in July.
In the fall of 2018, it was announced that Brad Roberts, Ellen Reid, Dan Roberts, and Mitch Dorge would be going on their first full tour of Canada and the United States in nearly two decades to celebrate the 25th anniversary of &quot;God Shuffled His Feet&quot;. The band continued to tour through 2022 in celebration of the 30th anniversary of their first album, &quot;The Ghosts That Haunt Me&quot;.

In early 2023, the band released &quot;Sacred Alphabet&quot;, their first song with the full band in over a decade. The song did not chart and received no substantive airplay on radio in Canada or elsewhere.

== Musical style ==
=== Instrumentation ===
Throughout their career, Crash Test Dummies have experimented with many different styles and genres of music. These styles include the acoustic folk rock of &quot;The Ghosts That Haunt Me&quot;, the electric alternative rock of &quot;A Worm&#x27;s Life&quot;, the urban influences of &quot;Give Yourself a Hand&quot;, and the optigan-based compositions of &quot;Oooh La La!&quot;

Crash Test Dummies recorded as a full five piece band from their debut album &quot;The Ghosts That Haunt Me&quot; until &quot;Give Yourself a Hand&quot;. At this time, the most notable instrumentation of the band&#x27;s music included Brad Roberts&#x27; lead guitar, Ellen Reid&#x27;s keyboards, and Benjamin Darvill&#x27;s harmonica. Another notable element of Crash Test Dummies&#x27; music are the contrasting harmonies between Brad Roberts&#x27; deep lead vocals and Ellen Reid&#x27;s backing vocals in the higher register.

Beginning with &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care That You Don&#x27;t Mind&quot; in 2001, the band&#x27;s albums were recorded primarily by Brad Roberts, Ellen Reid, and a rotating roster of session musicians.

=== Influences ===
One of the biggest influences for Brad Roberts was the band XTC and Andy Partridge in particular. The band even went on to cover two of XTC&#x27;s songs: &quot;The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, and &quot;All You Pretty Girls&quot; for the XTC tribute album &quot;A Testimonial Dinner&quot;.

<text>The Gutenberg Bible, also known as the 42-line Bible, the Mazarin Bible or the B42, was the earliest major book printed in Europe using mass-produced metal movable type. It marked the start of the &quot;Gutenberg Revolution&quot; and the age of printed books in the West. The book is valued and revered for its high aesthetic and artistic qualities and its historical significance. 

The Gutenberg Bible is an edition of the Latin Vulgate printed in the 1450s by Johannes Gutenberg in Mainz (Holy Roman Empire), in present-day Germany. Out of either 158 or 180 copies that were originally printed, 49 survive in at least substantial portion, 21 of them in entirety. They are thought to be among the world&#x27;s most valuable books, although no complete copy has been sold since 1978. In March 1455, the future Pope Pius II wrote that he had seen pages from the Gutenberg Bible displayed in Frankfurt to promote the edition.

The 36-line Bible, said to be the second printed Bible, is also sometimes referred to as a Gutenberg Bible, but may be the work of another printer.

==Text==
The Gutenberg Bible is an edition of the Vulgate, a Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and the Greek New Testament by St Jerome. The text contains emendations from the Parisian Bible tradition, and further divergences.

== Printing history ==
While it is unlikely that any of Gutenberg&#x27;s early publications would bear his name, the initial expense of press equipment and materials and of the work to be done before the Bible was ready for sale suggests that he may have started with more lucrative texts, including several religious documents, a German poem, and some editions of Aelius Donatus&#x27;s &quot;Ars Minor&quot;, a popular Latin grammar school book.

Preparation of the Bible probably began soon after 1450, and the first finished copies were available in 1454 or 1455. It is not known exactly how long the Bible took to print. The first precisely datable printing is Gutenberg&#x27;s 31-line Indulgence which certainly existed by 22 October 1454.

Gutenberg made three significant changes during the printing process.

Some time later, after more sheets had been printed, the number of lines per page was increased from 40 to 42, presumably to save paper. Therefore, pages 1 to 9 and pages 256 to 265, presumably the first ones printed, have 40 lines each. Page 10 has 41, and from there on the 42 lines appear. The increase in line number was achieved by decreasing the interline spacing, rather than increasing the printed area of the page. Finally, the print run was increased, necessitating resetting those pages which had already been printed. The new sheets were all reset to 42 lines per page. Consequently, there are two distinct settings in folios 1–32 and 129–158 of volume I and folios 1–16 and 162 of volume II.

The most reliable information about the Bible&#x27;s date comes from a letter. In March 1455, the future Pope Pius II wrote that he had seen pages from the Gutenberg Bible, being displayed to promote the edition, in Frankfurt. It is not known how many copies were printed, with the 1455 letter citing sources for both 158 and 180 copies. Scholars today think that examination of surviving copies suggests that somewhere between 160 and 185 copies were printed, with about three-quarters on paper and the others on vellum.

==The production process: &quot;Das Werk der Bücher&quot;==
In a legal paper, written after completion of the Bible, Johannes Gutenberg refers to the process as &quot;Das Werk der Bücher&quot; (&quot;the work of the books&quot;). He had introduced the printing press to Europe and created the technology to make printing with movable types finally efficient enough to facilitate the mass production of entire books.

Many book-lovers have commented on the high standards achieved in the production of the Gutenberg Bible, some describing it as one of the most beautiful books ever printed. The quality of both the ink and other materials and the printing itself have been noted.

===Pages===
The paper size is &#x27;double folio&#x27;, with two pages printed on each side (four pages per sheet). After printing the paper was folded once to the size of a single page. Typically, five of these folded sheets (ten leaves, or twenty printed pages) were combined to a single physical section, called a quinternion, that could then be bound into a book. Some sections, however, had as few as four leaves or as many as twelve leaves.

The 42-line Bible was printed on the size of paper known as &#x27;Royal&#x27;. A full sheet of Royal paper measures and a single untrimmed folio leaf measures . There have been attempts to claim that the book was printed on larger paper measuring , but this assertion is contradicted by the dimensions of existing copies. For example, the leaves of the copy in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, measure . This is typical of other folio Bibles printed on Royal paper in the fifteenth century. Most fifteenth-century printing papers have a width-to-height ratio of 1:1.4 (e.g. 30:42 cm) which, mathematically, is a ratio of 1 to the square root of 2 or, simply, formula_1. Many suggest that this ratio was chosen to match the so-called Golden Ratio, formula_2, of 1:1.6; in fact the ratios are, plainly, not at all similar (equating to a difference of about 12 per cent). The ratio of 1:1.4 was a long established one for medieval paper sizes. A single complete copy of the Gutenberg Bible has 1,288 pages (4×322 = 1288) (usually bound in two volumes); with four pages per folio-sheet, 322 sheets of paper are required per copy. The Bible&#x27;s paper consists of linen fibers and is thought to have been imported from Caselle in Piedmont, Italy based on the watermarks present throughout the volume.

===Ink===
In Gutenberg&#x27;s time, inks used by scribes to produce manuscripts were water-based. Gutenberg developed an oil-based ink that would better adhere to his metal type. His ink was primarily carbon, but also had a high metallic content, with copper, lead, and titanium predominating. Head of collections at the British Library, Kristian Jensen, described it thus: &quot;if you look [at the pages of The Gutenberg Bible] closely you will see this is a very shiny surface. When you write you use a water-based ink, you put your pen into it and it runs off. Now if you print that&#x27;s exactly what you don&#x27;t want. One of Gutenberg&#x27;s inventions was an ink which wasn&#x27;t ink, it&#x27;s a varnish. So what we call printer&#x27;s ink is actually a varnish, and that means it sticks to its surface.&quot;

===Type===
Each unique character requires a piece of master type in order to be replicated. Given that each letter has uppercase and lowercase forms, and the number of various punctuation marks and ligatures (e.g., &quot;&quot; for the letter sequence &quot;fi&quot;, commonly used in writing), the Gutenberg Bible needed a set of 290 master characters. It seems probable that six pages, containing 15,600 characters altogether, would be set at any one moment.

===Type style===
The Gutenberg Bible is printed in the blackletter type styles that would become known as Textualis (Textura) and Schwabacher. The name &quot;Textura&quot; refers to the texture of the printed page: straight vertical strokes combined with horizontal lines, giving the impression of a woven structure. Gutenberg already used the technique of justification, that is, creating a vertical, not indented, alignment at the left and right-hand sides of the column. To do this, he used various methods, including using characters of narrower widths, adding extra spaces around punctuation, and varying the widths of spaces around words.

===Rubrication, illumination and binding===
Initially the rubrics—the headings before each book of the Bible—were printed, but this practice was quickly abandoned at an unknown date, and gaps were left for rubrication to be added by hand. A guide of the text to be added to each page, printed for use by rubricators, survives.

The spacious margin allowed illuminated decoration to be added by hand. The amount of decoration presumably depended on how much each buyer could or would pay. Some copies were never decorated. The place of decoration can be known or inferred for about 30 of the surviving copies. It is possible that 13 of these copies received their decoration in Mainz, but others were worked on as far away as London. The vellum Bibles were more expensive, and perhaps for this reason tend to be more highly decorated, although the vellum copy in the British Library is completely undecorated.

There has been speculation that the &quot;Master of the Playing Cards&quot;, an unidentified engraver who has been called &quot;the first personality in the history of engraving,&quot; was partly responsible for the illumination of the copy held by the Princeton University library. However, all that can be said for certain is that the same model book was used for some of the illustrations in this copy and for some of the Master&#x27;s illustrated playing cards.

Although many Gutenberg Bibles have been rebound over the years, nine copies retain fifteenth-century bindings. Most of these copies were bound in either Mainz or Erfurt. Most copies were divided into two volumes, the first volume ending with The Book of Psalms. Copies on vellum were heavier and for this reason were sometimes bound in three or four volumes.

==Early owners==

The Bible seems to have sold out immediately, with some initial purchases as far away as England and possibly Sweden and Hungary. At least some copies are known to have sold for 30 florins (equivalent to about of gold), which was about three years&#x27; wages for a clerk. Although this made them significantly cheaper than manuscript Bibles, most students, priests or other people of moderate income would not have been able to afford them. It is assumed that most were sold to monasteries, universities and particularly wealthy individuals. At present only one copy is known to have been privately owned in the fifteenth century. Some are known to have been used for communal readings in monastery refectories; others may have been for display rather than use, and a few were certainly used for study. Kristian Jensen suggests that many copies were bought by wealthy and pious laymen for donation to religious institutions.

==Influence on later Bibles==
The Gutenberg Bible had a profound effect on the history of the printed book. Textually, it also had an influence on future editions of the Bible. It provided the model for several later editions, including the 36 Line Bible, Mentelin&#x27;s Latin Bible, and the first and third Eggestein Bibles. The third Eggestein Bible was set from the copy of the Gutenberg Bible now in Cambridge University Library. The Gutenberg Bible also had an influence on the Clementine edition of the Vulgate commissioned by the Papacy in the late sixteenth century.

==Forgeries==

Joseph Martini, a New York book dealer, found that the Gutenberg Bible held by the library of the General Theological Seminary in New York had a forged leaf, carrying part of Chapter 14, all of Chapter 15, and part of Chapter 16 of the Book of Ezekiel. It was impossible to tell when the leaf had been inserted into the volume. It was replaced in the fall of 1953, when a patron donated the corresponding leaf from a defective Gutenberg second volume which was being broken up and sold in parts. This made it &quot;the first imperfect Gutenberg Bible ever restored to completeness.&quot; In 1978, this copy was sold for US$2.2 million to the in Stuttgart, Germany.

==Surviving copies==
, 49 Gutenberg Bibles are known to exist, but of these only 21 are complete. Others have pages or even whole volumes missing. In addition, there are a substantial number of fragments, some as small as individual leaves, which are likely to represent about another 16 copies. Many of these fragments have survived because they were used as part of the binding of later books.

===Substantially complete copies===


=== Fragments ===
Some fragments of the Gutenberg Bible are housed at:

* The Library of Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland
* The Basel University Library, Basel, Switzerland
* The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia
* The Schiede Library at Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, USA
* The Rendsberg Fragment at Gottorf Castle, Schleswig, Germany
* The McCune Collection, California, USA
* The Clark Library at UCLA, California, USA
* The John Carter Brown Library of the Early Americas in Providence, Rhode Island, USA
Several fragments and single leaves sold at Christie&#x27;s Auction House or Sotheby&#x27;s in the 21st century.

==Recent history==
Today, few copies remain in religious institutions, with most now owned by university libraries and other major scholarly institutions. After centuries in which all copies seem to have remained in Europe, the first Gutenberg Bible reached North America in 1847. It is now in the New York Public Library. In the last hundred years, several long-lost copies have come to light, considerably improving the understanding of how the Bible was produced and distributed.

In 1921 a New York rare book dealer, Gabriel Wells, bought a damaged paper copy, dismantled the book and sold sections and individual leaves to book collectors and libraries. The leaves were sold in a portfolio case with an essay written by A. Edward Newton, and were referred to as &quot;Noble Fragments&quot;. In 1953 Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons, also book dealers in New York, dismembered a damaged paper copy of volume II. The largest portion of this, the New Testament, is now owned by Indiana University. The leaf carrying part of Chapter 14, all of Chapter 15, and part of Chapter 16 of the Book of Ezekiel was donated to the General Theological Seminary to repair their copy of the bible (now located at the Württembergische Landesbibliothek). The matching first volume of this copy was subsequently discovered in Mons, Belgium, having been bequeathed by Edmond Puissant to the city in 1934.

The only copy held outside Europe and North America is the first volume of a Gutenberg Bible (Hubay 45) at Keio University in Tokyo. The Humanities Media Interface Project (HUMI) at Keio University is known for its high-quality digital images of Gutenberg Bibles and other rare books. Under the direction of Professor Toshiyuki Takamiya, the HUMI team has made digital reproductions of 11 sets of the bible in nine institutions, including both full-text facsimiles held in the collection of the British Library.

The last sale of a complete Gutenberg Bible took place in 1978, which sold for $2.4 million. This copy is now in Austin, Texas. The price of a complete copy today is estimated at $25−35 million.

A two-volume paper edition of the Gutenberg Bible was stolen from Moscow State University in 2009 and subsequently recovered in an FSB sting operation in 2013.

Possession of a Gutenberg Bible by a library has been equated to keeping a &quot;trophy book&quot;.

<doc id="286330" wikidata="Q3832611" url="?curid=286330" title="Linda Miles">
<text>Linda M. Miles (born August 28, 1978) is an American former professional wrestler and professional wrestling manager. She worked under the ring name Shaniqua for World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s (WWE) SmackDown brand between 2002 and 2004. She won the second season of &quot;WWE Tough Enough&quot; alongside Jackie Gayda, receiving a one-year contract with WWE.

==Basketball==
After graduating from Hughes High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, Miles attended Rutgers University, where she played basketball for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. She graduated from Rutgers in 2001. In May 2001, she tried out for a roster spot with the Seattle Storm of the WNBA, but was released during the team&#x27;s training camp. Miles and her Rutgers teammates were featured in a 2004 documentary film of the team&#x27;s 2000–2001 season entitled &quot;This Is A Game, Ladies&quot;.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2004) ===
In 2002, Miles entered and won the second series of &quot;WWE Tough Enough&quot;. She and co-winner Jackie Gayda were awarded developmental contracts with the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment.

Miles made her in-ring debut on the June 8, 2002 episode of &quot;WWE Velocity&quot; and faced off against her villainous trainer, Ivory, with Gayda in her corner. Miles lost to Ivory after Gayda turned villainous by pushing her off the top turnbuckle, costing her the match. On the June 13 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Miles teamed with WWE Women&#x27;s Champion Trish Stratus to defeat the team of Gayda and Ivory. The two divas were then placed on the Raw brand. On the June 24 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Miles teamed with Trish Stratus to defeat Gayda and Molly Holly.

Later in 2002, Miles became the onscreen manager of Shelton Benjamin. It did not last long, however, as Benjamin formed Team Angle with Kurt Angle and Charlie Haas. Miles then disappeared from WWE television.

In late-2002, Miles was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling for further training and development.

Miles returned to WWE television in June 2003 as a villain under the name &quot;Shaniqua&quot;, the dominatrix manager of the Basham Brothers. She often interfered in matches, including a match where she surprisingly had to interfere to ensure the Bashams&#x27; victory over two jobbers. In the late summer of 2003, Shaniqua began to establish her dominance over the weaker divas. She interfered in the Bourbon Street Bikini Contest on the September 4 episode of Smackdown!, attacking all of the Divas except for Sable, who had escaped. After attacking Dawn Marie and Torrie Wilson, she press slammed Nidia over the top rope. She then began a brief feud with fellow SmackDown! divas Torrie Wilson, Dawn Marie and Nidia. One week after the Bourbon Street Bikini Contest, Dawn Marie challenged Shaniqua to a singles match in which Shaniqua won by disqualification after interference from Nidia and Wilson, who struck Shaniqua with a steel chair. The following week, Shaniqua defeated Wilson and Nidia in a handicap match. After said handicap match, the villainous Shaniqua attacked Dawn Marie, who had accompanied Nidia and Wilson to ringside, by delivering a big boot to her chest and then ramming her head into the ring post, proving that while on SmackDown! Linda Miles was the most dominant Diva on the SmackDown! roster. The feud then ended abruptly and Shaniqua was not seen on TV again until the October 2 episode of Smackdown! where she interfered in a match between the APA and the Basham Brothers, allowing the latter to achieve victory. For her troubles, she was nailed with a Clothesline From Hell via Bradshaw and was put out of action for several weeks. She made her return during the No Mercy PPV and gained a measure of retribution on Bradshaw by clubbing him in the back with a night stick during his tag team match against the Bashams. Upon Shaniqua&#x27;s return, she had new breast implants which were explained via storyline by permanent swelling as a result of the Clothesline From Hell weeks earlier. Shaniqua then spent the next few weeks in the Bashams corner during their feud with Los Guerreros, regularly interfering in matches. By late-2003 and early-2004, Shaniqua and the Basham Brothers sparked a feud with the then WWE Tag Team Champions Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi, with Shaniqua almost being given the Stink Face by Rikishi during house shows weekly between November 2003 and February 2004, and was eventually given the humiliating move at a house show. Shaniqua joined her team in a handicap WWE Tag Team championship match against Rikishi and Scotty Too Hotty at No Way Out. Shaniqua&#x27;s team lost when she was pinned following a Banzai Drop from Rikishi. This marked her last televised appearance with WWE.

Miles was subsequently once again assigned to Ohio Valley Wrestling. She was released from WWE on November 12, 2004, reportedly due to foul behavior.

=== Toryumon (2005) ===
After leaving WWE, Miles wrestled one final match. On May 14, 2005 in Mexico City, she wrestled for Toryumon as part of its eight anniversary show, losing to fellow former WWE Tough Enough contestant Nidia Guenard. She then retired from professional wrestling.

== Basketball refereeing career ==
After leaving professional wrestling, Miles began working as a college basketball referee.

<doc id="286335" wikidata="Q922967" url="?curid=286335" title="Southwark Cathedral">
<text>Southwark Cathedral ( ), formally the Cathedral and Collegiate Church of St Saviour and St Mary Overie, is a Church of England cathedral in Southwark, London, near the south bank of the River Thames and close to London Bridge. It is the mother church of the Diocese of Southwark. It has been a place of Christian worship for more than 1,000 years, but the church was not raised to cathedral status until the creation of the diocese of Southwark in 1905.

Between 1106 and 1538, it was the church of an Augustinian priory, Southwark Priory, dedicated in honour of the Virgin Mary (St Mary – over the river, &#x27;overie&#x27;). Following the dissolution of the monasteries, it became a parish church, with a dedication to the Holy Saviour (St Saviour). The church was in the diocese of Winchester until 1877, when the parish of St Saviour&#x27;s, along with other South London parishes, was transferred to the diocese of Rochester. The present building retains the basic form of the Gothic structure built between 1220 and 1420, although the nave is a late 19th-century reconstruction.

==History==

===Legendary origins===
The 16th-century London historian John Stow recorded an account of the origins of the Southwark Priory of St Mary that he had heard from Bartholomew Linsted, who had been the last prior when the priory was dissolved. Linsted claimed it had been founded as a nunnery &quot;long before the [Norman] Conquest&quot; by a maiden named Mary, on the profits of a ferry across the Thames she had inherited from her parents. Later it was converted into a college of priests by &quot;&quot;Swithen&quot;, a noble lady&quot;. Finally in 1106 it was refounded as an Augustinian priory.

The tale of the ferryman&#x27;s daughter Mary and her benefactions became very popular, but later historians tried to rationalise Linsted&#x27;s story. Thus the author of an 1862 guidebook to the then St Saviour&#x27;s Church suggested it was probable that the &quot;noble lady&quot; Swithen had in fact been a man – Swithun, Bishop of Winchester, from 852 or 853 until his death in 863.

In the 20th century this identification was accepted by Thomas P. Stevens, succentor and sacrist, and later honorary canon, of Southwark Cathedral, who wrote a number of guidebooks to the cathedral, and a history that was revised and reprinted many times. He went on to date the foundation of the supposed original nunnery to &quot;about the year 606&quot;, although he provided no evidence to support the date. Although recent guidebooks are more circumspect, referring only to &quot;a tradition&quot;, an information panel at the east end of the cathedral still claims that there had been &quot;A convent founded in 606 AD&quot; and &quot;A monastery established by St Swithun in the 9th century&quot;.

It is unlikely that this minster pre-dated the conversion of Wessex in the mid-7th century, or the foundation of the &quot;burh&quot; c. 886. There is no proof for suggestions that a convent was founded on the site in 606 nor for the claim that a monastery was founded there by St Swithun in the 9th century.

===Saxon and Norman===

The earliest reference to the site was in the Domesday Book of 1086, when the &quot;minster&quot; of Southwark seems to have been under the control of William the Conqueror&#x27;s half-brother, Bishop Odo of Bayeux.

The Old English minster was a collegiate church serving an area on the south side of the Thames. In 1106, during the reign of Henry I it became an Augustinian priory, under the patronage of the Bishops of Winchester, who established their London seat Winchester Palace immediately to the west in 1149. A remaining wall of the palace refectory, with a rose window, survives in Clink Street.

The Priory was dedicated to the Virgin Mother as &#x27;St Mary&#x27; but had the additional soubriquet of &quot;Overie&quot; (&quot;over the river&quot;) to distinguish it from the many churches in the City of London (on the opposite bank of the Thames) with the same name.

Some fragments of 12th-century fabric survive. The church in its present form, however, dates to between 1220 and 1420, making it the first Gothic church in London.

===Gothic reconstruction===
The church was severely damaged in the Great Fire of 1212. Rebuilding took place during the thirteenth century, although the exact dates are unknown. In its reconstructed state – the basic layout of which survives today – the church was cruciform in plan, with an aisled nave of six bays, a crossing tower, transepts, and a five-bay choir. Beyond the choir stood a lower retrochoir or Lady chapel, the form of which can also be interpreted as group of four chapels with separate gabled roofs, two opening from the choir, and two from each aisle.

There was a chapel dedicated to Mary Magdalen, for the use of the parishioners, in the angle between the south transept and the choir, and another chapel was later added to the east of the retrochoir. This was to become known as the &quot;Bishop&#x27;s chapel&quot; as it was the burial place of Lancelot Andrewes.

In the 1390s, the church was again damaged by fire, and in around 1420 the Bishop of Winchester, Henry Beaufort, assisted with the rebuilding of the south transept and the completion of the tower.

During the 15th century the parochial chapel was rebuilt, and the nave and north transept were given wooden vaults following the collapse of the stone ceiling in 1469. Some of the carved bosses from the vault (destroyed in the 19th century) are preserved in the cathedral.

The 14th-century poet John Gower lived in the priory precinct and is entombed in the church, with a splendid memorial, with polychrome panels. There is also a recumbent effigy of a knight in timber (rather than brass or stone) and it is suggested by the church that this dates from the 13th century. If so then this is one of the oldest such memorials and some credence can be given to the suggestion by its lack of heraldic emblems.

===16th and 17th centuries===

In around 1520 the Bishop of Winchester, Richard Foxe, carried out a programme of improvement, installing a stone altar screen, a new west doorway with a window above and a new window in the east gable of the choir.

Along with all the other religious houses in England, the priory was dissolved by Henry VIII, being surrendered to the Crown in 1540. The receiver in charge of dissolving St Marie Overie was William Saunders. In that year St Mary Overie received the new dedication of St Saviour and became the church of a new parish, which combined those of St Mary Magdalen (the attached parochial chapel) and the nearby church of St Margaret, which was deconsecrated. The parishioners leased the priory church and rectory from the Crown until 1614, when they purchased the church outright for £800.

During the reign of Queen Mary heresy trials were held in the retrochoir. In January 1555, six high-ranking clergymen, including the former Bishop of Gloucester, John Hooper, were condemned to death there.

As the parish church for the Bankside area, St Saviour&#x27;s had close connections with the great Elizabethan dramatists. William Shakespeare&#x27;s brother, Edmund, was buried there in 1607. His grave is unmarked, but a commemorative stone was later placed in the paving of the choir. The cathedral instituted a festival to commemorate this cultural history in the 1920s which endured into the late 20th century.

There is a large stained glass window dedicated to William Shakespeare, depicting scenes from his plays, at the base of which is an alabaster statue representing the playwright reclining, holding a quill. Two dramatists, John Fletcher and Philip Massinger were buried in the church. Along with Edward Alleyn they were officers and benefactors of the parish charities and of St Saviour&#x27;s Grammar School.

John Harvard was born in the parish and was baptised in the church on 29 November 1607. He is commemorated by the Harvard Chapel in the north transept, paid for by Harvard University alumni resident in England. His father, Robert, a local butcher and inn-holder, was a business associate of Shakespeare&#x27;s family and a parochial, school, and church officer with the playwright&#x27;s colleagues.

The connection with the bishops of Winchester continued after the Reformation. Lancelot Andrewes, bishop of Winchester until his death in 1626, and a contributor to the Authorized Version of the Bible, was buried in a small chapel at the east end that afterwards became known as the &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Chapel&quot;. After the destruction of the chapel in 1830, his tomb was moved to a new position, immediately behind the high altar.

It was from the tower of St Saviour&#x27;s that the Czech artist Wenceslas Hollar drew his &quot;Long View of London from Bankside&quot; in 1647, a panorama which has become a definitive image of the city in the 17th century.

===19th century===

By the early 19th century the fabric of the church had fallen into disrepair. All the medieval furnishings were gone, and the interior was as Francis Bumpus later described it, &quot;pewed and galleried to a fearful extent.&quot; Between 1818 and 1830, the tower and choir were restored by George Gwilt Jun. In his efforts to return the church to its thirteenth-century appearance, Gwilt removed the early sixteenth-century windows at the east end of the choir and, lacking firm evidence as to the original design, substituted an elevation of his own invention, with three lancet windows, and a circular one in the gable above. The transepts were restored, less sympathetically, by Robert Wallace. The Bishop&#x27;s Chapel and parochial chapel were removed, but plans for the demolition of the retrochoir were averted, and it was restored by Gwilt in 1832.

At a vestry meeting held in May 1831 it was decided to remove the nave roof, which had become unsafe, leaving the interior open to the weather, and to hold all future services in the choir and transepts. In 1839, the roofless nave was demolished to within seven feet of the ground, and rebuilt to a design by Henry Rose.

The new nave was at a higher level than the surviving mediaeval eastern part, and closed off from it by a glazed screen. It had a plaster vault carried on iron columns, and a wooden gallery around three sides. It was widely criticised, notably by Pugin who wrote &quot;It is bad enough to see such an erection spring up at all, but when a venerable building is demolished to make way for it, the case is quite intolerable.&quot;

On the initiative of Anthony Thorold, Bishop of Rochester, the nave was once again rebuilt between 1890 and 1897 by Arthur Blomfield, in a manner intended to recreate its 13th-century predecessor as accurately as possible, and to preserve the few surviving mediaeval fragments. In 1895 an appeal was issued to complete the restoration, with some £8000 required to restore the choir and tower. The church&#x27;s treasurer was Sir Frederick Wigan.

The main railway viaduct connecting London Bridge station to Blackfriars, Cannon Street and Charing Cross stations passes only eighteen metres from the southeast corner of the cathedral, blocking the view from the south side. This was a compromise when the railway was extended along this viaduct in 1852; the alternative was to demolish the building completely to allow a more direct passage for the line.

The churchyard was closed to burials in 1853 (an exception being made in 1856 for Gwilt). In 1910, on behalf of the cathedral chapter, the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association&#x27;s landscape gardener Madeline Agar renovated the south-west corner of the churchyard. That garden was restored in 2001.

===Since 1900===

The collegiate parish church of St Saviour was designated as a cathedral in 1905 when the Church of England Diocese of Southwark was created. The nearby early-18th-century church of St Thomas became the new cathedral&#x27;s chapter-house.

The cathedral stands in an area heavily damaged by German bombing during the Second World War. The total number of bombs dropped on Southwark between 7 October 1940 to 6 June 1941 alone was 1,651 High Explosive Bombs and 20 Parachute Mines. On 20 February 1941 it was reported (after being unrestricted by the ministry of information) that the cathedral had been damaged by a bomb. Shrapnel damage is still visible on the outside of the building to this day.

There are memorials to Isabella Gilmore and the victims of the &quot;Marchioness&quot; disaster and monuments to Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu. In 2001 Mandela opened a new northern &quot;cloister&quot; on the site of the old monastic one, with a refectory, shop, conference centre, education centre and museum. In 2002, these Millennium buildings received an award for being one of the best new buildings of the year.

On 16 November 1996 the cathedral became a focus of controversy when it hosted a twentieth-anniversary service for the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement. Jeffrey John, the openly gay Dean of St Albans and former bishop-elect of Reading, had been Canon Theologian of Southwark.

After the introduction of civil partnerships and, later, of civil marriage for same-sex couples in England, the cathedral announced that &quot;same sex couples are welcome to approach the clergy with regard to preparation and prayers when entering a Civil Partnership and for continuing support and counsel within their relationship ... couples approaching the clergy should expect a warm welcome and affirmation&quot;. The cathedral now says, &quot;Southwark Cathedral is an inclusive community where LGBTi+ people are welcomed and affirmed. The clergy would be delighted to help you to prepare prayerfully for your Civil Partnership.&quot;

==Other information==
The cathedral is used by London South Bank University for its annual honorary degree ceremony, by Regent&#x27;s College for its graduation ceremonies, and by King&#x27;s College London for its medical and dental degree ceremonies, an association stemming from its merger with Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; teaching hospitals, St Thomas&#x27; having started as an infirmary attached to the Priory of St Mary. The cathedral also hosts the London Nautical School&#x27;s annual Christmas Carol Service.

There are two other cathedrals in Southwark: the Roman Catholic St George&#x27;s Cathedral Southwark and the Greek Orthodox St Mary&#x27;s at Camberwell New Road.

== Resident cat ==
The cathedral is known for having a resident cat. The first such cat Doorkins Magnificat, a brown female cat who began visiting in 2008 as a stray looking for food and shelter. She later made the cathedral her permanent home and was often found curled up beneath a radiator or prowling the aisles. Dean Colin Slee named the cat as a joke reference to prominent atheist Richard Dawkins. Doorkins became known as a local celebrity and met both the Mayor of London and Queen Elizabeth II on formal visits to the cathedral. She is the subject of the children&#x27;s book &quot;Doorkins the Cathedral Cat&quot;, and in 2018 was immortalised with a stone gargoyle inside the cathedral. Doorkins retired from the cathedral and was adopted by one of the cathedral staff in October 2019. The death of Doorkins was reported on 2 October 2020. A memorial service was held at the cathedral on 27 October 2020, something apparently unprecedented for a cat and reported in the national press. 

The cathedral made plans to acquire a new cat in 2020, due to mouse problems in the building and a feeling that Doorkins&#x27; presence was missed. Hodge, a black and white tuxedo cat, was formally adopted from a rescue organisation in 2020, coincidentally on the day of Doorkins&#x27; death. Like Doorkins, Hodge has become a celebrity in his own right with various souvenirs available in the cathedral shop, and his own social media accounts.

==Cathedral choirs==

===Main Cathedral Choir===

The Cathedral Choir is supported financially by the St Olave&#x27;s &amp; St Saviour&#x27;s Schools Foundation, which stems from the two parochial schools set up in the 1560s which still hold their commemoration and annual services at the cathedral as their &#x27;foundation&#x27; church. As the cathedral does not have a choir school, the boys and girls of the Cathedral Choir are drawn from schools throughout London and surrounding areas. Girls are usually admitted to the choir between the ages of ten and eleven, and boys between the ages of seven and ten. There are six Lay Clerks in the Cathedral Choir and up to six Choral Scholars. Three of the Lay Clerks are supported by endowments from The Ouseley Trust, the Vernon Ellis Foundation, and the Friends of Cathedral Music.

The Cathedral Choir performed the music for the television series &quot;Mr. Bean&quot;.

Former choristers of Southwark Cathedral include David Gedge, who served as Organist of Brecon Cathedral from 1966 until 2007, Richard Marlow, who subsequently directed the choir at Trinity College, Cambridge, and Chuka Umunna, former Member of Parliament for Streatham and formerly Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills.

Ernest Lough, who later made a celebrated recording of &quot;O for the Wings of a Dove&quot; with the choir of the Temple Church under George Thalben-Ball, auditioned unsuccessfully for a position as chorister at Southwark Cathedral.

Both Alan Young and Jonathan Darbourne, Hammerstein Chanters (head choristers) between 1999 and 2000, were also trebles at English National Opera. Darbourne, in particular, is known for critically acclaimed performances as Miles in Britten&#x27;s &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; at the East London Theatre on Well Street (now Ensign Street) and as one of the three Child-Spirits in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; at the London Coliseum. Young performed Harry in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Albert Herring&quot;, Paris in Tippet&#x27;s &quot;King Priam&quot;, and John (silent role) in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;. Rollo Armstrong also used Young&#x27;s recorded vocals for Dusted&#x27;s single &quot;Always Remember to Respect and Honour Your Mother&quot;, which reached no. 19 in the UK single charts.

===Merbecke Choir===
In 2004 the cathedral founded the Southwark Cathedral Merbecke Choir. It is intended to be the place both for boys and girls who leave the cathedral choirs and also other young singers who wish to maintain their sight-reading skills acquired as choristers and explore a wide range of repertoire under expert tuition.

The choir sings Compline on the fourth Sunday of each month and performs a seasonal concert of music each term. It also sings for livery companies in the City of London and for other organisations. In 2006 it performed as part of the Queen&#x27;s Christmas Broadcast, which was recorded at the cathedral.

The choir is named after the Tudor composer John Merbecke (1510–1585) who wrote one of the most popular settings of the Book of Common Prayer communion service. In 1543, Merbecke and three other companions were tried for heresy in the retrochoir at Southwark. He was found guilty and condemned to death, but his sentence was commuted by Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, who decided that, as a mere musician, Merbecke &quot;knew no better&quot;.

===Thursday Singers===
The Thursday Singers are made up of people from the local community. There is no audition. They sing for festival Eucharists which fall on a weekday. They also sing one service of Choral Evensong most terms and lead the singing at the cathedral&#x27;s Carol Sing-In before Christmas.

===Hubert Chesshyre and child sexual abuse scandal===
Hubert Chesshyre was a lay clerk of Southwark Cathedral from 1971 until 2003. He was also a member of the British Royal Household, serving as Clarenceux King of Arms and Secretary of the Order of the Garter. Because of his connections with both the Royal Household and the cathedral choir, Chesshyre saw through a grant of a coat of arms to the cathedral and a separate grant awarding heraldic badges to the area bishops of Kingston-upon-Thames, Woolwich, and Croydon.

At a trial of the facts held in 2015, it was proven that Chesshyre, who had dementia and was therefore found to be unfit to plead, had sexually abused a teenage chorister during the 1990s.

==Organ==
The cathedral&#x27;s main organ was built by Lewis &amp; Co. of Brixton, and completed in 1897. It was inspired by the Schulze organ of Doncaster Minster. Thomas Christopher Lewis, the company&#x27;s founder, was renowned for building instruments that had a bright, vibrant tone which, in part, was due to his use of low wind pressures. Consequently, he was somewhat out of step with the trend at the time, which was tending towards high wind pressures and rather thicker tone. The instrument&#x27;s action was, and is, electro-pneumatic with slider chests, and the main case was designed by Arthur Blomfield.

Apart from routine maintenance, the instrument remained untouched until 1952, when Henry Willis &amp; Sons undertook a major rebuild, during which the wind pressures were increased. The balanced swell pedal and the hitch-down solo pedal were replaced by Willis&#x27;s Infinite Speed and Gradation pedals. The choir organ – which had been housed in front of the swell – was relocated to the north side, and a new console was installed adjacent to it (the original console was on the south side). The choir organ&#x27;s Flauto Traverso was replaced by a nazard, and a tierce was provided on a new slider. A number of new couplers were also provided and the violon unit (32&#x27;-16&#x27;-8&#x27;) was extended by 12 pipes to create a Viola 4&#x27;.

Some years after the rebuild it was thought that the Willis changes, though well intentioned, detracted too much from the original concept, so it was decided to restore the instrument to the Lewis specifications. The Durham-based firm of Harrison and Harrison was engaged, and the work was carried out in two stages. In 1986, the electrics were renewed, and although the Willis console was retained, it was given a solid state action with eight memory levels for the combination pistons and four for the crescendo pedal. Also, the Willis swell pedals were replaced by balanced pedals.

In 1991, the main work was undertaken, including the re-voicing of the stops on Lewis&#x27;s original wind pressures. A Lewis Flauto Traverso rank was obtained for the choir organ, to replace the one discarded by Willis, and the nazard and tierce were removed – meaning that the great organ&#x27;s octave quint is now the instrument&#x27;s only mutation register. The two prepared for drawstops on the pedal were also disposed of. Thus, the stop list is now as Lewis left it, except for the Viola 4&#x27; which was retained because it was a gift &quot;&quot;.

Former organists of Southwark Cathedral have included organist/composer Starling Goodwin (1711-1774) who also played at the Ranelagh Gardens, E. T. Cook, who was known for his lunchtime organ broadcasts on the BBC, and the organ builder Ralph Downes.

<text>Lintong District (), formerly Lintong County, is one of 11 urban districts of the prefecture-level city of Xi&#x27;an, the capital of Shaanxi Province, Northwest China. The district was approved to establish from the former &quot;Lintong County&quot; () by the Chinese State Council on June 25, 1997. The Terracotta Army and the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor was discovered in March 1974 near this district. The district borders the prefecture-level cities of Xianyang to the northwest and Weinan to the east, Gaoling County to the northeast, Baqiao District to the southeast, Lianhu and Xincheng Districts to the south, and Chang&#x27;an District to the southwest.

Artifacts from the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, China&#x27;s first emperor, can be viewed at the Emperor Qinshihuang&#x27;s Mausoleum Site Museum () in Lintong District.

The National Time Service Center, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (), formerly known as Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory (), was established in 1966 in Lintong responsible for the time standard in mainland China. It was renamed to its present name in 2001.

The name of the district comes from two rivers. Lin river is on the east side and Tong river is on the west side of the district.

Lintong is headquarters of the 47th Group Army of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, one of the two group armies that comprise the Lanzhou Military Region responsible for defending China&#x27;s northwest borders.

==Administrative divisions==
As 2020, Lintong District is divided to 23 subdistricts.

<text>A scriptorium () was a writing room in medieval European monasteries for the copying and illuminating of manuscripts by scribes.

The term has perhaps been over-used—only some monasteries had special rooms set aside for scribes. Often they worked in the monastery library or in their own rooms. Most medieval images of scribing show single figures in well-appointed studies, although these are generally author portraits of well-known authors or translators. Increasingly, lay scribes and illuminators from outside the monastery also assisted the clerical scribes. By the later Middle Ages secular manuscript workshops were common, and many monasteries bought more books than they produced themselves.

== The functional outset ==
When monastic institutions arose in the early sixth century (the first European monastic writing dates from 517), they defined European literary culture and selectively preserved the literary history of the West. Monks copied Jerome&#x27;s Latin Vulgate Bible and the commentaries and letters of early Church Fathers for missionary purposes as well as for use within the monastery.

In the copying process, there was typically a division of labor among the monks who readied the parchment for copying by smoothing and chalking the surface, those who ruled the parchment and copied the text, and those who illuminated the text. Sometimes a single monk would engage in all of these stages to prepare a manuscript. 
The illuminators of manuscripts worked in collaboration with scribes in intricate varieties of interaction that preclude any simple understanding of monastic manuscript production.

The products of the monasteries provided a valuable medium of exchange.
Comparisons of characteristic regional, periodic as well as contextual styles of handwriting do reveal social and cultural connections among them, as new hands developed and were disseminated by travelling individuals, respectively what these individuals represented, and by the examples of manuscripts that passed from one cloister to another. 
Recent studies follow the approach, that &quot;scriptoria&quot; developed in relative isolation, to the extent that paleographers are sometimes able to identify the product of each writing centre and to date it accordingly.

By the start of the 13th century, secular workshops developed, 
where professional scribes stood at writing-desks to work the orders of customers, and during the Late Middle Ages the praxis of writing was becoming not only confined to being generally a monastic or regal activity. However, the practical consequences of private workshops, and as well the invention of the printing press vis-a-vis monastic &quot;scriptoria&quot; is a complex theme.

There is also evidence that women scribes, in religious or secular contexts, produced texts in the medieval period. Archaeologists identified lapis lazuli, a pigment used in the decoration of medieval illuminated manuscripts, embedded in the dental calculus of remains found in a religious women&#x27;s community in Germany, which dated to the 11th-12th centuries. Chelles Abbey, established in France during the early medieval period, was also well known for its scriptorium, where nuns produced manuscripts and religious texts. There is also evidence of Jewish women working as scribes of Hebrew texts from the 13th to 16th centuries, though these women primarily worked out of their homes rather than religious institutions, as daughters and wives of scribes. Women were not only the producers of these texts, but could also be the consumers or commissioners of them. There were also women who worked as professional, secular scribes, including Clara Hätzlerin in 15th century Augsburg, who has at least nine surviving manuscripts signed by or attributed to her.

==The physical scriptorium==
Much as medieval libraries do not correspond to the exalted sketches from Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, it seems that ancient written accounts, as well as surviving buildings, and archaeological excavations do not invariably attest to the evidence of scriptoria. Scriptoria, in the physical sense of a room set aside for the purpose, perhaps mostly existed in response to specific scribal projects; for example, when a monastic (and) or regal institution wished a large number of texts copied.

References in modern scholarly writings to &#x27;scriptoria&#x27; typically refer to the collective written output of a monastery, somewhat like the chancery in the early regal times is taken to refer to a specific fashion of modelling formulars, but especially traditional is the view that scriptoria was a necessary adjunct to a library, as per the entry in du Cange, 1678 &#x27;scriptorium&#x27;.

===San Giovanni Evangelista, Rimini===
At this church whose patron was Galla Placidia (died 450), paired rectangular chambers flanking the apse, accessible only from each aisle, have been interpreted as paired (Latin and Greek) libraries and perhaps scriptoria. The well-lit niches half a meter deep, provisions for hypocausts beneath the floors to keep the spaces dry, have prototypes in the architecture of Roman libraries.

===Cassiodorus and the Vivarium===
The monastery built in the second quarter of the 6th century under the supervision of Cassiodorus at the Vivarium near Squillace in southern Italy contained a scriptorium, for the purpose of collecting, copying, and preserving texts.

Cassiodorus&#x27; description of his monastery contained a purpose-built scriptorium, with a sundial, a water-clock, and a &quot;perpetual lamp,&quot; that is, one that supplied itself with oil from a reservoir. The scriptorium would also have contained desks where the monks could sit and copy texts, as well as the necessary ink wells, penknives, and quills. Cassiodorus also established a library where, at the end of the Roman Empire, he attempted to bring Greek learning to Latin readers and to preserve texts both sacred and secular for future generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus collected as many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his monks in the proper uses of texts. In the end, however, the library at the Vivarium was dispersed and lost, though it was still active around 630.

===Cistercians===
The scriptoria of the Cistercian order seem to have been similar to those of the Benedictines. The mother house at Cîteaux, one of the best-documented high-medieval scriptoria, developed a severe &quot;house style&quot; in the first half of the 12th century. The 12th-century scriptorium of Cîteaux and its products, in the context of Cistercian scriptoria, have been studied by Yolanta Załuska, &quot;L&#x27;enluminure et le scriptorium de Cîteaux au XIIe siècle&quot; (Brecht:Cîteaux) 1989.

== Institutions ==
In Byzantium or Eastern Roman Empire learning maintained importance and numerous monastic &#x27;scriptoria&#x27; were known for producing Bible/Gospel illuminations, along with workshops that copied numerous classical and Hellenistic works. Records show that one such monastic community was that of Mount Athos, which maintained a variety of illuminated manuscripts and ultimately accumulated over 10,000 books.

===Benedictines===
Cassiodorus&#x27; contemporary, Benedict of Nursia, allowed his monks to read the great works of the pagans in the monastery he founded at Monte Cassino in 529. The creation of a library here initiated the tradition of Benedictine scriptoria, where the copying of texts not only provided materials needed in the routines of the community and served as work for hands and minds otherwise idle, but also produced a marketable end-product. Saint Jerome stated that the products of the scriptorium could be a source of revenue for the monastic community, but Benedict cautioned, &quot;If there be skilled workmen in the monastery, let them work at their art in all humility&quot;.

In the earliest Benedictine monasteries, the writing room was actually a corridor open to the central quadrangle of the cloister. The space could accommodate about twelve monks, who were protected from the elements only by the wall behind them and the vaulting above. Monasteries built later in the Middle Ages placed the scriptorium inside, near the heat of the kitchen or next to the calefactory. The warmth of the later scriptoria served as an incentive for unwilling monks to work on the transcription of texts (since the charter house was rarely heated).

====St. Gall====
The Benedictine Plan of St. Gall is a sketch of an idealised monastery dating from 819 to 826, which shows the scriptorium and library attached to the northeast corner of the main body of the church; this is not reflected by the evidence of surviving monasteries. Although the purpose of the plan is unknown, it clearly shows the desirability of scriptoria within a wider body of monastic structures at the beginning of the 9th century.

===Cistercians===
There is evidence that in the late 13th century, the Cistercians would allow certain monks to perform their writing in a small cell &quot;which could not... contain more than one person&quot;. These cells were called scriptoria because of the copying done there, even though their primary function was not as a writing room.

===Carthusians===
The Carthusians viewed copying religious texts as their missionary work to the greater Church; the strict solitude of the Carthusian order necessitated that the manual labor of the monks be practiced within their individual cells, thus many monks engaged in the transcription of texts. In fact, each cell was equipped as a copy room, with parchment, quill, inkwell, and ruler. Guigues du Pin, or Guigo, the architect of the order, cautioned, &quot;Let the brethren take care the books they receive from the cupboard do not get soiled with smoke or dirt; books are as it were the everlasting food of our souls; we wish them to be most carefully kept and most zealously made.&quot;

===The Orthodox church===

====The Resava====

After the establishment of Manasija Monastery by Stefan Lazarević in the early 15th century, many educated monks have gathered there. They fostered copying and literary work that by its excellence and production changed the history of the South Slavic literature and languages spreading its influence all over the Orthodox Balkans. One of the most famous scholars of the so-called School of Resava was Constantine the Philosopher /Konstantin Filozof/, an influential writer and biographer of the founder of the school (Stefan Lazarević).

====Rača====
During the Turkish invasions of the Serbian lands (which lasted from the end of the 14th to the beginning of the 19th centuries) the monastery was an important centre of culture. The scriptorium of each monastery was a bastion of learning where illuminated manuscripts were being produced by monk-scribes, mostly Serbian liturgical books and Old Serbian &quot;Vita.&quot; hagiographies of kings and archbishops.

Numerous scribes of the Serbian Orthodox Church books—at the term of the 16th and the beginning of the 18th centuries—who worked in the Rača monastery are named in Serbian literature – &quot;The Račans&quot;. Among the monk-scribes the most renown are the illuminator Hieromonk Hristifor Račanin, Kiprijan Račanin, Jerotej Račanin, Teodor Račanin and Gavril Stefanović Venclović. These are well-known Serbian monks and writers that are the link between literary men and women of the late medieval (Late Middle Ages) and Baroque periods in art, architecture and literature in particular.

==Monastic rules==
===Cassiodorus&#x27; &quot;Institutes&quot;===
Although it is not a monastic rule as such, Cassiodorus did write his &quot;Institutes&quot; as a teaching guide for the monks at Vivarium, the monastery he founded on his family&#x27;s land in southern Italy. A classically educated Roman convert, Cassiodorus wrote extensively on scribal practices. He cautions over-zealous scribes to check their copies against ancient, trustworthy exemplars and to take care not to change the inspired words of scripture because of grammatical or stylistic concerns. He declared &quot;every work of the Lord written by the scribe is a wound inflicted on Satan&quot;, for &quot;by reading the Divine Scripture he wholesomely instructs his own mind and by copying the precepts of the Lord he spreads them far and wide&quot;. It is important to note that Cassiodorus did include the classical texts of ancient Rome and Greece in the monastic library. This was probably because of his upbringing, but was, nonetheless, unusual for a monastery of the time. When his monks copied these texts, Cassiodorus encouraged them to amend texts for both grammar and style.

===Saint Benedict===
The more famous monastic treatise of the 7th century, Saint Benedict of Nursia&#x27;s Rule, fails to mention the labor of transcription by name, though his institution, the monastery of Montecassino, developed one of the most influential scriptoria, at its acme in the 11th century, which made the abbey &quot;the greatest center of book production in South Italy in the High Middle Ages&quot;. Here was developed and perfected the characteristic &quot;Cassinese&quot; Beneventan script under Abbot Desiderius.

The Rule of Saint Benedict does explicitly call for monks to have ready access to books during two hours of compulsory daily reading and during Lent, when each monk is to read a book in its entirety. Thus each monastery was to have its own extensive collection of books, to be housed either in armarium (book chests) or a more traditional library. However, because the only way to obtain a large quantity of books in the Middle Ages was to copy them, in practice this meant that the monastery had to have a way to transcribe texts in other collections. An alternative translation of Benedict&#x27;s strict guidelines for the oratory as a place for silent, reverent prayer actually hints at the existence of a scriptorium. In Chapter 52 of his Rule, Benedict&#x27;s warns: &quot;Let the oratory be what it is called, and let nothing else be done or stored there&quot;. But &quot;condatur&quot; translates both as &quot;stored&quot; and &quot;to compose or write,&quot; thus leaving the question of Benedict&#x27;s intentions for manuscript production ambiguous. The earliest commentaries on the Rule of Saint Benedict describe the labor of transcription as the common occupation of the community, so it is also possible that Benedict failed to mention the scriptorium by name because of the integral role it played within the monastery.

====Saint Ferréol====
Monastic life in the Middle Ages was strictly centered around prayer and manual labor. In the early Middle Ages, there were many attempts to set out an organization and routine for monastic life. Montalembert cites one such sixth-century document, the Rule of Saint Ferréol, as prescribing that &quot;He who does not turn up the earth with the plough ought to write the parchment with his fingers.&quot; As this implies, the labor required of a scribe was comparable to the exertion of agriculture and other outdoor work. Another of Montalembert&#x27;s examples is of a scribal note along these lines: &quot;He who does not know how to write imagines it to be no labour, but although these fingers only hold the pen, the whole body grows weary.&quot;

===Cistercians===
An undated Cistercian ordinance, ranging in date from 1119 to 1152 (Załuska 1989) prescribed &quot;literae unius coloris et non depictae&quot; (&quot;letters of one color and not ornamented&quot;), that spread with varying degrees of literalness in parallel with the Cistercian order itself, through the priories of Burgundy and beyond.

In 1134, the Cistercian order declared that the monks were to keep silent in the scriptorium as they should in the cloister.

==Books and transcription in monastic life==

Manuscript-writing was a laborious process in an ill-lit environment that could damage one&#x27;s health. One prior complained in the tenth century:
&quot;Only try to do it yourself and you will learn how arduous is the writer&#x27;s task. It dims your eyes, makes your back ache, and knits your chest and belly together. It is a terrible ordeal for the whole body&quot;. 
The director of a monastic scriptorium would be the &quot;armarius&quot; (&quot;provisioner&quot;), who provided the scribes with their materials and supervised the copying process. However, the armarius had other duties as well. At the beginning of Lent, the armarius was responsible for making sure that all of the monks received books to read, but he also had the ability to deny access to a particular book. By the 10th century the armarius had specific liturgical duties as well, including singing the eighth responsory, holding the lantern aloft when the abbot read, and approving all material to be read aloud in church, chapter, and refectory.

While at Vivarium c. 540–548, Cassiodorus wrote a commentary on the Psalms entitled &quot;Expositio Psalmorum&quot; as an introduction to the Psalms for individuals seeking to enter the monastic community. The work had a broad appeal outside of Cassiodorus&#x27; monastery as the subject of monastic study and reflection.

Abbot Johannes Trithemius of Sponheim wrote a letter, &quot;De Laude Scriptorum&quot; (In Praise of Scribes), to Gerlach, Abbot of Deutz in 1492 to describe for monks the merits of copying texts. Trithemius contends that the copying of texts is central to the model of monastic education, arguing that transcription enables the monk to more deeply contemplate and come to a more full understanding of the text. He then continues to praise scribes by saying &quot;The dedicated scribe, the object of our treatise, will never fail to praise God, give pleasure to angels, strengthen the just, convert sinners, commend the humble, confirm the good, confound the proud and rebuke the stubborn&quot;. Among the reasons he gives for continuing to copy manuscripts by hand, are the historical precedent of the ancient scribes and the supremacy of transcription to all other manual labor. This description of monastic writing is especially important because it was written after the first printing presses came into popular use. Trithemius addresses the competing technology when he writes, &quot;The printed book is made of paper and, like paper, will quickly disappear. But the scribe working with parchment ensures lasting remembrance for himself and for his text&quot;. Trithemius also believes that there are works that are not being printed but are worth being copied.

In his comparison of modern and medieval scholarship, James J. O&#x27;Donnell describes monastic study in this way:
&quot;[E]ach Psalm would have to be recited at least once a week all through the period of study. In turn, each Psalm studied separately would have to be read slowly and prayerfully, then gone through with the text in one hand (or preferably committed to memory) and the commentary in the other; the process of study would have to continue until virtually everything in the commentary has been absorbed by the student and mnemonically keyed to the individual verses of scripture, so that when the verses are recited again the whole phalanx of Cassiodorian erudition springs up in support of the content of the sacred text&quot;. 
In this way, the monks of the Middle Ages came to intimately know and experience the texts that they copied. The act of transcription became an act of meditation and prayer, not a simple replication of letters.

<text>Radio Televisión Martí is an American state-run radio and television international broadcaster based in Miami, Florida, financed by the federal government of the United States through the U.S. Agency for Global Media (formerly Broadcasting Board of Governors, BBG). It transmits propaganda in Spanish to Cuba and its broadcasts can also be heard and viewed worldwide through their website and on shortwave radio frequencies.

Named after the Cuban national hero and intellectual José Martí, Radio Televisión Martí was established in 1983 and TV Martí was added in 1990. The 2014 budget for the Cuba broadcasting program was approximately US$27 million.

Radio y Televisión Martí is overseen by the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB).

Radio Televisión Martí is an element of the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB).

==Radio Martí==

===History===

In the early 1980s, the U.S. Government planned to create a radio station to be known as Radio Free Cuba, modeled on Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the mission of fighting communism in the hope of hastening the fall of Cuban President Fidel Castro. The station – renamed &quot;Radio Martí&quot; after Cuban writer José Martí, who had fought for Cuba&#x27;s independence from Spain and against U.S. influence in the Americas – was established in 1983 by President Ronald Reagan at the urging of Jorge Mas Canosa. Existing North American broadcasters objected strenuously to the establishment of Radio Martí, fearing that its broadcasts would lead Cuba to retaliate by jamming existing commercial medium-wave broadcasts from Florida.

On May 20, 1985, Radio Martí began broadcasts to Cuba from the United States. The first day of broadcasting was chosen to commemorate the 83rd anniversary of Cuba&#x27;s independence from United States rule on May 20, 1902. The fears of broadcasters proved well-founded, when Cuba-based transmitters briefly broadcast powerful signals on the medium-wave band in 1985, disrupting U.S. AM radio station broadcasts in several states. Cuba continues to broadcast interference against U.S. broadcasts specifically directed to Cuba in attempts to prevent them from being received within Cuba.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, the budget for all U.S.-government-run foreign broadcasters, with the exception of Radio Martí, was sharply reduced. In 1996, Radio Martí″s studios were moved from Washington, D.C. to Miami, Florida. The move, in addition to placing the station&#x27;s studios closer to its target audience, also underscored its growing independence from the Voice of America, another U.S.-government-run foreign broadcaster with which Radio Martí had previously shared studios.

===Today===
Today, Radio Marti broadcasts a 24-hour radio program over short-wave transmitters in Greenville, North Carolina, and a medium-wave transmitter in Marathon, Florida (GC: ). Its studios are located in Miami, Florida. Cuba jams both the medium-wave and shortwave signals, but the shortwave program is heard throughout the Americas. 

Two hours of Radio Martí&#x27;s news programs are carried each night, 10:00 PM to midnight local time, by Miami&#x27;s WSUA (Caracol 1260 AM). It is also available at various times to subscribers of SiriusXM Satellite Radio on its bilingual channel 153, &quot;La Politica Talk&quot;.

Radio Martí operates with about 100 employees and a budget of $15 million. Its mission, in its own words, is to provide &quot;a contrast to Cuban media and provide its listeners with an uncensored view of current events.&quot; Former prisoners in Cuba and Cuban exiles often speak on Radio Martí, and on Saturdays a Spanish-language version of the U.S. president&#x27;s weekly radio address, as well as the opposition&#x27;s response, are transmitted.

==Assessments==
There is much debate about the effectiveness of these broadcasts. As with Radio Free Europe during the Cold War, there is no way to judge the station&#x27;s true audience through the usual listener surveys. Thus, the actual number of listeners is open to speculation. However, after the fall of the communist Soviet satellite governments of Eastern Europe in 1989 and of the Soviet Union itself at the end of 1991, a Hoover Institution conference reviewing reports from citizens in newly independent Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other countries tended to substantiate the effectiveness of RFE and U.S. Voice of America broadcasts both in providing information and bolstering pro-liberal democracy movements within those countries, despite attempts at electronic jamming and counter-propaganda.

The watchdog group Cuban Americans for Engagement (CAFE) has been critical of the radio and television station for broadcasts critical of warming relations and cooperative efforts with U.S. organizations. A report by the Committee on Foreign Relations in 2010 stated that less than 2 percent of Cubans listen in. U.S. Senator Mark Pryor (D-Arkansas) and U.S. House of Representatives member Betty McCollum introduced the Stop Wasting Taxpayer Money on Cuba Broadcasting Act to shut the stations down. The Alliance for Responsible Cuba Policy has also been critical of the stations.

==TV Martí==
===History===
In 1990, the U.S. Government created TV Martí to broadcast television programming to Cuba. It began broadcasting on March 27, 1990, beaming daily programs in Spanish via a transmitter affixed to an aerostat balloon – nicknamed &quot;Fat Albert&quot; by people in the area – tethered 10,000 feet (3,048 m) above Cudjoe Key, Florida. Weather affected the broadcasts; &quot;Fat Albert&quot; sometimes was hauled down because of high winds, once broke loose and drifted into the Everglades in 1991, and was destroyed by Hurricane Dennis in 2005. After the aerostat″s destruction, TV Martí in October 2006 began to use fixed-wing aircraft to transmit its signals, first a military C-130 Hercules which proved too expensive to operate, and then a Gulfstream twin engine airplane flying a figure-eight pattern off Key West, Florida. One of these aircraft has since been retired.

The first TV Martí broadcasts took place in the very early morning hours to avoid interference with Cuban domestic television programming. This combined with Cuban jamming of the signal has led to low viewership of TV Martí in Cuba, where, according to a U.S. official who was stationed in Havana in the station″s early days, it is known as &quot;La TV que no se ve&quot; (&quot;The TV that can&#x27;t be seen&quot;). U.S. Government telephone surveys in 1990, 2003, 2006, and 2008 reported Cuban viewership of TV Martí of less than one percent; the U.S. Government ceased the surveys after 2008, claiming that obtaining accurate Cuban domestic television viewership statistics was too difficult.

Despite the frequent reports of its low viewership in Cuba, TV Martí″s defenders cited continuing Cuban government jamming of its signal as evidence of its importance, and U.S. Government funding of it continued, with TV Martí broadcasting daily programs in Spanish. In 2012, the administration of President Barack Obama finally asked the United States Congress to cease funding of the program, but Congress nonetheless continued to provide money for it.

===TV Martí today===

Like Radio Martí, TV Martí is an element of the International Broadcasting Bureau. TV Marti airs half-hour early and late evening newscasts which a low-power Miami television channel, WGEN-LD, Virtual digital Channel 8.1 (RF digital Channel 8.1), carries along with other programming. The pay-TV platform DirecTV, which is pirated by many people in Cuba, also carries TV Martí.

In May 2013, the U.S. Congress finally eliminated funding for the operation of &quot;Aero Martí&quot;, the lone aircraft still committed to TV Martí broadcasts. However, funding for the preservation and maintenance of the plane continues, and it remains in storage in a hangar in Cartersville, Georgia, ready to return to service if funding of its operations resumes.

==Controversy and legality==
Fabio Leite, Deputy Director of the Radiocommunications Office of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), has condemned radio and television transmissions to Cuba from the United States as illegal and inadmissible and more so when they are designed to foment internal subversion on the island. The director emphasized that this constant U.S. attack is in violation of ITU regulations, which stipulate that radio transmissions within commercial broadcasting on medium wave, FM, or television must be conceived of as a good quality national service within the limits of the country concerned.

The Radio Martí broadcasts are directed at Cuba, but can be picked up throughout North, Central, and South America when Cuba is not jamming them. However, Radio Martí programs cannot be specifically directed at U.S. citizens under the same law that restricts Voice of America broadcasts.

On November 15, 2007, delegates to the World Radiocommunication Conference 2007 declared illegal the U.S. government&#x27;s use of airplanes to beam the signals of Washington-funded Radio y Televisión Martí into Cuba, stating &quot;A radio broadcasting station that functions on board an aircraft and transmits only to the territory of another administration without its agreement cannot be considered in conformity with the radio communications regulations.&quot;

A report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office accuses the station of engaging in political propaganda in the forms of editorializing, use of offensive and incendiary language in broadcasts, use of unsubstantiated reports coming from Cuba, and presentation of individual views as news. The claims of unprofessionalism are strongly rejected by the station&#x27;s management. National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;On the Media&quot; program has pointed out that while &quot;the U.S. has spent close to a half billion dollars on TV and Radio Martí, the Cuban government has managed to effectively block the transmission signal, at least on the TV side. Viewership on the island is estimated to be a third of one percent. One study several years ago found that nine out of ten Cubans had never even heard of the channel.&quot;

&quot;Democracy Now!&quot; went on to state that a senior TV Martí executive was indicted by federal prosecutors for providing kickbacks in trade for certain contracts and the inspector general″s office has launched a review into the operations of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting which oversees Martí. In addition, the program indicates that Massachusetts Congressman William Delahunt has also promised to hold hearings on TV Martí.

Other critics consider the actual ineffectiveness to reach a Cuban audience, the risk of the broadcaster&#x27;s purposes for heavy budget-cuts and the fear of limited editorial independence in order to be manipulated by right-wing Cuban exiles and their political agenda for personal political gain.

In May 2018 Martí broadcast video segments attacking George Soros as a &quot;multimillionaire Jew of Hungarian origin&quot; threatening Latin American democracy. The videos were based on assertions by Judicial Watch. In October 2018 the employees responsible for producing the videos were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into their conduct.

<doc id="286344" wikidata="Q812983" url="?curid=286344" title="Bull-baiting">
<text>Bull-baiting is a blood sport involving pitting a bull against dogs with the aim of attacking and subduing the bull by biting and holding onto its nose or neck, which often resulted in the death of the bull. 

==History==
===England===

Crowds in London during the Royal Entry of James VI and I in March 1604 were entertained by bull-baiting. During the time of Queen Anne, bull-baiting was practiced in London at Hockley-in-the-Hole, twice a week – and was also reasonably common in provincial towns, for instance at Birmingham&#x27;s Bull Ring. At Tutbury, a bull was tied to an iron stake so that it could move within a radius of about 30 feet. The object of the sport was for the dogs to immobilize the bull.

Before the event started, the bull&#x27;s nose was blown full of pepper to enrage it before the baiting. The bull was often placed in a hole in the ground. A variant of bull-baiting was &quot;pinning the bull&quot;, where specially-trained dogs would set upon the bull one at a time, a successful attack resulting in the dog fastening his teeth strongly in the bull&#x27;s snout. The extinct Old English Bulldog was specially bred for this sport.
Bull-baiting was not only practiced as a form of recreation; there was a long-held belief that baiting improved the meat quality and tenderness when consumed. By the early nineteenth century, the sport began to die out, both because the baiting caused a public nuisance and because of new concerns about animal cruelty.

The Bull Baiting at Wokingham was advertised in the newspaper in 1774.
Bull baiting advertised in 1780 appears to indicate that it was organized by a local hostelry. 

A bill for the suppression of the practice was introduced into the House of Commons in 1800 by Sir William Pulteney. The bill was defeated by a one-vote margin. A second bill was introduced in 1802 by John Dent, but was defeated by thirteen votes. Bull baiting was still taking place, a newspaper reported in 1818 that a bull being taken from the stake to a stable had killed a man at Bilston Wake. Bulls were excluded from the protections afforded to other cattle in the Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822. Bull-baiting was not finally outlawed until Parliament passed the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, which forbade the keeping of any house, pit, or other places for baiting or fighting any bull, bear, dog, or other animals.

===Ireland===
Bull-baiting () was widespread in Ireland in the 17th–19th centuries.

In Dublin, bull-baiting took place near the Cornmarket and in Smithfield. On St Stephen&#x27;s Day 1789, a riot followed a bull-bait: soldiers fired on the crowd and four were killed.

In Wexford, the activity arrived in 1621, brought by the Guild of Butchers. Bulls were baited twice a year and their hides presented to the Mayor. The area where bull-baiting took place is still called the Bullring.

In Kilkenny it took place at the site called The Ring, first in 1609, and commonly on the feast-day of John the Baptist (December 27). The last recorded bull-bait was in 1837, after they had become illegal under an 1835 Act.

Bull-baiting also took place in Waterford, Naas, Drogheda, Tuam, Carrickfergus, Belfast and Athlone.

===North America===

In the 19th century, and during Spanish Colonial Rule, bulls used to be pitted against bears in California and Mexico. Kingsley (1920) said that the bulls that fought the bears, at least while California was part of the United States, were not domesticated Hereford bulls, but Spanish Fighting Bulls, whose weight, agility, speed, sharp horns, and hot temper were said to be dangerous to both bears and humans, and Wistar (1937) said that those bulls were fearless. In a case of the bull winning, victory could come early, when the bull used its strength to gore the bear to death with its horns, or toss the bear into the air.

===Dogs in bull baiting===

Bull-baiting dogs, including Old English Bulldogs, Bullenbeissers, Spanish Bulldogs, Ca de Bous and bull and terriers, were bred to bait animals, mainly bulls and bears. During bull-baiting, the dog would attempt to flatten itself to the ground, creeping as close to the bull as possible, then darting out and attempting to bite the bull in the nose or head area. The bull would often be tethered by a collar and rope, which were staked into the ground. As the dog darted at the bull, the bull would attempt to catch the dog with his head and horns, and throw the dog into the air.

In 1835, the Cruelty to Animals Act was passed in Parliament that outlawed &quot;Blood Sport&quot; in the United Kingdom. The bulldog&#x27;s work was suddenly over and the bulldog rapidly started dying out. Around 1865, dog fanciers began developing dog clubs which eventually culminated into conformation shows. Many fanciers utilized various remnants of the dog utilized for &quot;Blood Sport&quot; to resurrect the &quot;Bull&quot; dog and ultimately developed today&#x27;s modern English bulldog.

==In literature==

Washington Irving, in his 1837 book, &quot;The Adventures of Captain Bonneville&quot;, wrote that a bear was baited, and likewise, a wild, fierce bull, before they were brought by vaqueros to an arena in a small amphitheatre in Monterey, California, to fight each other. He called the fight &quot;a favorite, though barbarous sport.&quot; In this case, he said that the bear used its sharp claws against the nose of the bull, before catching its tongue, after being repeatedly gored by the bull. Then the bull overturned it &quot;with a desperate effort&quot;, and then &quot;dispatched&quot; it rather easily.

<text>Turkology (or Turcology or Turkic studies) is a complex of humanities sciences studying languages, history, literature, folklore, culture, and ethnology of people speaking Turkic languages and the Turkic peoples in chronological and comparative context. That includes ethnic groups from the Sakha, in eastern Siberia, to the Turks in the Balkans and the Gagauz, in Moldova.

==History==
Ethnological information on Turkic tribes for the first time was systemized by the 11th-century Turkic philologist Mahmud al-Kashgari in the &quot;Dīwān ul-Lughat it-Turk&quot; (Dictionary of Turkic language). Multi-lingual dictionaries were compiled from the late 13th century for the practical application of participants in international trade and political life. One notable such dictionary is the &quot;Codex Cumanicus&quot;, which contains information for Cuman, Persian, Latin, and German. There are also bilingual dictionaries for Kipchak and Armenian. as well as Kipchak and Russian.

In the Middle Ages, Turkology was centered on Byzantine/Greek historians, ambassadors and travelers, and geographers. In the 15th to the 17th centuries the main subject of Turkology was the study of the Ottoman Empire, the Turkish language, and the Turkic languages of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. In 1533 a first hand-written primer appeared, and by 1612 a printed grammar by Jerome Megizer was published, followed by F. Mesgnien-Meninski&#x27;s four-volume published in 1680.

Peter Simon Pallas initiated a more scientific approach to Turkology with his &quot;Comparative dictionaries of all languages and dialects&quot; (1787) which included lexical materials from Tatar, Mishar, Nogai, Bashkir, and other Turkic languages. In the 19th century, Turkology was further developed by M. A. Kazembek&#x27;s &quot;Grammar of the Turkish-Tatar language&quot; (1839), O. N. Betlingk &quot;Grammar of the Yakut language&quot; (1851). A major achievement was the deciphering at the end of the 19th century of the Early Middle Age Orkhon inscriptions by V. Thomsen and W. W. Radloff (1895). By the late 19th century, Turkology had developed into a complex discipline that included linguistics, history, ethnology, archeology, arts and literature.

In the 20th century, the Turkology complex included physical anthropology, numismatics, genetics, ancient Turkic alphabetic scripts, typology, genesis, and etymology, onomastics and toponymy. The appearance of (1905–1927) inaugurated specialised periodicals, followed by (1921–1926). Scientific developments allowed calibrated dating, dendrochronology, metallurgy, chemistry, textile, and other specialized disciplines, which contributed to the development of the Turkological studies. Deeper study of the ancient sources allowed better understanding of economical, social, mythological and cultural forces of the sedentary and nomadic societies. Linguistic studies uncovered preliterate symbioses and mutual influences between different peoples.

===Persecution in Soviet Russia===

On 9 August 1944, the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, published an edict prohibiting &quot;ancientization&quot; of Turkic history. The edict was followed by a consecutive wave of mass arrests, imprisoning and killing of the Turkology intelligentsia, massive creation of replacement scientists, and rewriting of history pages on an industrial scale.

Many Turkology scholars in the Soviet Union were persecuted or imprisoned by Joseph Stalin&#x27;s political oppression movement, the Great Purge, during the 1930s and the 1940s, on the basis of disputed Islamic writings and publications. Other cultural Scholars, such as Egyptologists and Japanologists were also subject to the political repression, in Stalin&#x27;s movement to cleanse Communist Russia of ethnic minorities that posed opposition to Communism.

Most Oriental and other cultural scholars that had been repressed in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as their respective scientific works, were, however, officially rehabilitated in or after 1956.

On the other hand, the edict brought unintended benefits to Turkology. One was the nearly immediate linguistic development of an alternate lexicon, which replaced the nouns and adjectives containing the word &quot;Türk&quot; by a wealth of euphemisms: &quot;nomads, Siberians, Paleosiberians, Middle Asians, Scythians, Altaians, Tuvians&quot;, etc. that filled scientific publications. The other was &quot;writing into a drawer&quot;, when results of the years of fruitful work were written down for future publication. When the bonds relaxed, the publications exploded. Another was a flight of scientists from European Russia into remote areas, which brought first class scientists to many intellectually starved outlying areas of Central Asia. Another one was connected with the statewide efforts to re-invent the history, when a wealth of Turkological facts were found in the process of search for &quot;correct&quot; history. And another one was a built-up of the public interest for the forbidden subjects, that resulted that no print size could satisfy the demand. L.N.Gumilev and O.Suleimenov inflamed a surge in the new generation of Turkology scholars.

With the physical culling of the scholars from the society, an organized a total extermination of all their published and unpublished works took place concurrently. Their books were removed from the libraries and destroyed from private collections by an intimidated population, articles and publications were culled, published photographs were retouched, private photographs were destroyed, published scientific references were erased, and publications with undesired references were destroyed. Very few of the early 20th century expedition diaries, ethnographical notes, reports and drafts for publications were ever recovered.

<doc id="286348" wikidata="Q566949" url="?curid=286348" title="Annie Get Your Gun (musical)">
<text>Annie Get Your Gun is a 1946 musical with lyrics and music by Irving Berlin and a book by Dorothy Fields and her brother Herbert Fields. The story is a fictionalized version of the life of Annie Oakley (1860–1926), a sharpshooter who starred in &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot;, and her romance with sharpshooter Frank E. Butler (1847–1926).

The 1946 Broadway production was a hit, and the musical had long runs in both New York (1,147 performances) and London, spawning revivals, a 1950 film version and television versions. Songs that became hits include &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;, &quot;Doin&#x27; What Comes Natur&#x27;lly&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Get a Man with a Gun&quot;, &quot;They Say It&#x27;s Wonderful&quot;, and &quot;Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)&quot;.

==History and background==
Dorothy Fields had the idea for a musical about Annie Oakley to star her friend Ethel Merman. Producer Mike Todd turned the project down, so Fields approached a new producing team, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. After the success of their first musical collaboration, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, Rodgers and Hammerstein had decided to become producers of both their own theatrical ventures and those by other authors. They agreed to produce the musical and asked Jerome Kern to compose the music; Fields would write the lyrics, and she and her brother Herbert would write the book. Kern, who had been composing for movie musicals in Hollywood, returned to New York on November 2, 1945, to begin work on the score to &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, but three days later, he collapsed on the street due to a cerebral hemorrhage. Kern was hospitalized, and he died on November 11, 1945. The producers and Fields then asked Irving Berlin to write the musical&#x27;s score; Fields agreed to step down as lyricist, knowing that Berlin preferred to write both music and lyrics to his songs. Berlin initially declined to write the score, worrying that he would be unable to write songs to fit specific scenes in &quot;a situation show&quot;. Hammerstein persuaded him to study the script and try writing some songs based on it, and within days, Berlin returned with the songs &quot;Doin&#x27; What Comes Naturally&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Get a Man With a Gun&quot;, and &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;. Berlin&#x27;s songs suited the story and Ethel Merman&#x27;s abilities, and he readily composed the rest of the score to &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;. The show&#x27;s eventual hit song, &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;, was almost left out of the show because Berlin mistakenly got the impression that Richard Rodgers did not like it. In imitation of the structure of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; a secondary romance between two of the members of the Wild West Show was added to the musical during its development.

According to some sources, the role of Annie was originally offered to Mary Martin, who turned it down. This is not true. Dorothy Fields went to the hospital after Merman gave birth to her son to ask her if she would do the show. The show was conceived for Merman, but when time came to send out the post-Broadway national tour and Merman was unwilling to do it, Martin jumped at the chance, going on the road for approximately two years and belting out the songs, which had the effect of lowering her voice from its normal lyric-coloratura range to mezzo-soprano-alto.

For the 1999 revival, Peter Stone revised the libretto, eliminating what were considered insensitive references to American Indians, including the songs &quot;Colonel Buffalo Bill&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m An Indian Too&quot;. Stone said, &quot;The big challenge is taking a book that was wonderfully crafted for its time and make it wonderfully crafted for our time... It was terribly insensitive...to Indians... But it had to be dealt with in a way that was heartfelt and not obvious... In this case, it was with the permission of the heirs. They&#x27;re terribly pleased with it.&quot; Stone also altered the structure of the musical, beginning it with &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot; and presenting the musical as a &quot;show within a show&quot;.

==Plot summary==
===Act I===
When the traveling Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West show visits Cincinnati, Ohio (&quot;Colonel Buffalo Bill&quot;), Frank Butler, the show&#x27;s handsome, womanizing star (&quot;I&#x27;m a Bad, Bad, Man&quot;), challenges anyone in town to a shooting match. Foster Wilson, a local hotel owner, doesn&#x27;t appreciate the Wild West show taking over his hotel, so Frank gives him a side bet of one hundred dollars on the match. Annie Oakley enters and shoots a bird off Dolly Tate&#x27;s hat, and then explains her simple backwoods ways to Wilson with the help of her siblings (&quot;Doin&#x27; What Comes Natur&#x27;lly&quot;). When Wilson learns she&#x27;s a brilliant shot, he enters her in the shooting match against Frank Butler.

While waiting for the match to start, Annie meets Frank Butler and is instantly smitten with him, not knowing he will be her opponent. When she asks Frank if he likes her, Frank explains that the girl he wants will &quot;wear satin... and smell of cologne&quot; (&quot;The Girl That I Marry&quot;). The rough and naive Annie comically laments that &quot;You Can&#x27;t Get a Man with a Gun&quot;. At the shooting match, Annie finds out that Frank is the &quot;big swollen-headed stiff&quot; from the Wild West show. She wins the contest, and Buffalo Bill and Charlie Davenport, the show&#x27;s manager, invite Annie to join the Wild West Show. Annie agrees because she loves Frank even though she has no idea what &quot;show business&quot; is. Frank, Charlie, and Buffalo Bill explain that &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;.

Over the course of working together, Frank becomes enamored of the plain-spoken, honest, tomboyish Annie and, as they travel to Minneapolis, Minnesota, on a train, he explains to her what &quot;love&quot; is (&quot;They Say It&#x27;s Wonderful&quot;). Buffalo Bill and Charlie discover that their rival, Pawnee Bill&#x27;s Far East Show, will be playing in Saint Paul, Minnesota, while the Wild West show plays in nearby Minneapolis. They ask Annie to do a special shooting stunt on a motorcycle to draw Pawnee Bill&#x27;s business away. Annie agrees because the trick will surprise Frank. She sings her siblings to sleep with the &quot;Moonshine Lullaby&quot;.

As Annie and Frank prepare for the show, Frank plans to propose to Annie after the show and then ruefully admits that &quot;My Defenses Are Down&quot;. When Annie performs her trick and becomes a star, Chief Sitting Bull adopts her into the Sioux tribe (&quot;I&#x27;m An Indian Too&quot;). Hurt and angry, Frank walks out on Annie and the show, joining the competing Pawnee Bill&#x27;s show.

===Act II===
Returning to New York from a tour of Europe with the Buffalo Bill show, Annie learns that the show has gone broke. Sitting Bull, Charlie, and Buffalo Bill plot to merge Buffalo Bill&#x27;s show with Pawnee Bill&#x27;s as they believe that show is doing well financially. Annie, now well-dressed and more refined and worldly, still longs for Frank (&quot;I Got Lost in His Arms&quot;).

At a grand reception for Buffalo Bill&#x27;s troupe at the Hotel Brevoort, Pawnee Bill, Dolly, and Frank also plot a merger of the two companies, assuming Buffalo Bill&#x27;s show made a fortune touring Europe. When they all meet, they soon discover both shows are broke. Annie, however, has received sharpshooting medals from all the rulers of Europe worth one hundred thousand dollars, and she decides to sell the medals to finance the merger, rejoicing in the simple things (&quot;I Got the Sun in the Mornin&#x27;&quot;). When Frank appears, he and Annie confess their love and decide to marry, although with comically different ideas: Frank wants &quot;some little chapel&quot;, while Annie wants &quot;A wedding in a big church with bridesmaids and flower girls/ A lot of ushers in tail coats/ Reporters and photographers&quot; (&quot;An Old-Fashioned Wedding&quot;o). When Annie shows Frank her medals, Frank again has his pride hurt. They call off the merger and the wedding, but challenge each other to one last shooting match to decide who is the best shot.

On the ferry to the Governors Island match site, Dolly attempts to ruin Annie&#x27;s chances by tampering with her guns. She is caught and stopped by Sitting Bull and Charlie. However, they then decide to follow through with Dolly&#x27;s plan so that Annie will lose the match, knowing that would soothe Frank&#x27;s ego allowing the two to reconcile and the merger to take place.

As the match is ready to begin, Annie and Frank&#x27;s egos come out again with each claiming they are better than the other (&quot;Anything You Can Do&quot;). Sitting Bull convinces Annie to deliberately lose the match to Frank, reminding her that she &quot;can&#x27;t get a man with a gun.&quot; That done, Frank and Annie finally reconcile, deciding to marry and merge the shows.

==Productions==

===Original productions===
&quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; premiered on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre on May 16, 1946, and ran for 1,147 performances. Directed by Joshua Logan, the show starred Ethel Merman as Annie, Ray Middleton as Frank Butler, Lea Penman as Dolly Tate, Art Bernett as Foster Wilson, Harry Bellaver as Chief Sitting Bull, Kenneth Bowers as Tommy Keeler, Marty May as Charlie Davenport, Warren Berlinger as the Little Boy and William O&#x27;Neal as Buffalo Bill.

The musical toured the U.S. from October 3, 1947, starting in Dallas, Texas, with Mary Martin as Annie. This tour also played Chicago and Los Angeles. Martin stayed with the tour until mid-1948.

The show had its West End premiere on June 7, 1947, at the London Coliseum where it ran for 1,304 performances. Dolores Gray played Annie with Bill Johnson as Frank.

The first Australian production opened at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Melbourne on July 19, 1947. It starred Evie Hayes as Annie with Webb Tilton as Frank.

A French version, &quot;Annie du Far-West&quot;, starring Marcel Merkes and Lily Fayol, began production at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris on February 19, 1950, and ran for over a year.

===1958 Broadway revival===
The first Broadway revival was staged in 1958 at the New York City Center, directed by Donald Burr and produced by Jean Dalrymple, director of the NYCC Light Opera Company. This production opened on February 19, 1958, and ran until March 2, for 16 performances. Betty Jane Watson played the role of Annie with David Atkinson as Frank, Margaret Hamilton as Dolly, James Rennie as Chief Buffalo Bill, and Jack Whiting as Charles Davenport. Included in the cast was Harry Bellaver, reprising his original role of Chief Sitting Bull. The program didn&#x27;t list the performer who was to play Annie, and instead a &quot;to-be-announced&quot; statement was substituted for the name. At the last minute, Watson signed for the role. Even the program for the second week of the two-week engagement didn&#x27;t list her name, except as understudy; this was the first time in memory that a leading performer wasn&#x27;t listed.

===1966 Broadway revival===
The show had its second Broadway revival in 1966 at the Music Theater of Lincoln Center. This production opened on May 31, 1966, and ran until July 9, followed by a short 10-week U.S. Tour. It returned to Broadway at the Broadway Theatre on September 21 for 78 performances. Ethel Merman reprised her original role as Annie with Bruce Yarnell as Frank, Benay Venuta as Dolly, and Jerry Orbach as Charles Davenport. The libretto and score were revised: The secondary romance between Tommy Keeler and Winnie Tate was completely eliminated, including their songs &quot;I&#x27;ll Share it All With You&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Love, I Hope?&quot;, and the song &quot;An Old-Fashioned Wedding&quot; was specially written for the revival and added to the second act. This version of the show is available for licensing for amateur performances. This production was telecast in an abbreviated ninety-minute version by NBC on March 19, 1967, and is the only musical revived at Lincoln Center during the 1960s to be telecast.

===1973 Shady Grove Music Fair production===
Jay Harnick directed a revival at the Shady Grove Music Fair starring Barbara Eden, John Bennett Perry and Sandra Peabody that ran from 1973 to 1974.

=== 1976 Mexican production ===
In 1976 a Spanish-language version was produced in Mexico City with the name of &quot;Annie es un tiro&quot;. It was directed by José Luis Ibáñez and starred by Mexican film star Silvia Pinal. The production was represented at the Teatro Hidalgo and was co starred by the actor and singer Manuel López Ochoa. The success of the production produced the first Spanish-language version of the musical&#x27;s soundtrack.

===1977 Los Angeles Civic Light Opera production===
In 1977, Gower Champion directed a revival for the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera starring Debbie Reynolds as Annie. The Assistant Director was James Mitchell. Harve Presnell, Reynolds&#x27;s former co-star in the 1964 film &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;, played Frank Butler. The cast featured Art Lund as Buffalo Bill, Bibi Osterwald as Dolly Tate, Gavin MacLeod as Charlie Davenport,
Peter Bruni as Foster Wilson, Don Potter as Pawnee Bill, and Manu Tupou as Sitting Bull. The cast also included Trey Wilson and Debbie Shapiro. The production later toured various North American cities, but never ran on Broadway, its planned destination.

===1986 UK tour and London revival===
In 1986, a David Gilmore Chichester Festival Theatre production, with American rock star Suzi Quatro as Annie and Eric Flynn as Frank, opened at the Chichester Festival Theatre. It moved to the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, and then to the Aldwych Theatre in London&#x27;s West End where it played from July 29 to October 4. The cast recorded an album, Annie Get Your Gun - 1986 London Cast and Quatro&#x27;s songs &quot;I Got Lost in His Arms&quot;/&quot;You Can&#x27;t Get a Man with a Gun&quot; were released as a single. Since then &quot;I Got Lost in His Arms&quot; has also been included in the compilation albums &quot;The Divas Collection&quot; (2003) and &quot;Songs from the Greatest Musicals&quot; (2008).

===1992 London revival===
A short-lived London production ran at the Prince of Wales Theatre in the West End, starring Kim Criswell as Annie. Criswell&#x27;s studio cast recording of the show - made with Thomas Hampson and conductor John McGlinn - provided the impetus for the production. Pippa Ailion was the Casting Director for this production.

===1999 Broadway revival===
In 1999, a new production had its pre-Broadway engagement at the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C., from December 29, 1998, to January 24, 1999. Previews began on Broadway on February 2, 1999, at the Marquis Theatre, with an official opening on March 4, 1999, and closed on September 1, 2001, after 35 previews and 1,045 performances.

This revival starred Bernadette Peters as Annie and Tom Wopat as Frank, and Ron Holgate as Buffalo Bill, with direction by Graciela Daniele, choreography by Jeff Calhoun, and music arrangements by John McDaniel. Peters won the 1999 Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical and the production won the Tony for Best Revival of a Musical.

This production had a revised book by Peter Stone and new orchestrations, and was structured as a &quot;show-within-a-show&quot;, set as a Big Top travelling circus. &quot;Frank Butler&quot; is alone on stage and Buffalo Bill introduces the main characters, singing &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;, which is reprised when &quot;Annie&quot; agrees to join the traveling Wild West show. The production dropped several songs (including &quot;Colonel Buffalo Bill&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m A Bad, Bad Man&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m an Indian Too&quot;), but included &quot;An Old-Fashioned Wedding&quot;. There were several major dance numbers added, including a ballroom scene. A sub-plot which had been dropped from the 1966 revival, the romance between Winnie and Tommy, her part-Native-American boyfriend, was also included. In the 1946 production, Winnie was Dolly&#x27;s daughter, but the 1966 &amp;1999 productions she is Dolly&#x27;s younger sister. In this version, the final shooting match between Annie and Frank ends in a tie.

====Notable replacements====
While Peters was on vacation, &quot;All My Children&quot; star Susan Lucci made her Broadway debut as Annie from December 27, 1999, until January 16, 2000. Peters and Wopat left the show on September 2, 2000. Former &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; star Cheryl Ladd made her Broadway debut as Annie on September 6, 2000, with Patrick Cassidy as Frank Butler. Country music singer Reba McEntire made her Broadway debut as Annie from January 26, 2001, to June 22, 2001, opposite Brent Barrett as Frank. On June 23, 2001, former &quot;Wings&quot; star Crystal Bernard, who had been playing Annie in the national tour of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, assumed the role of Annie in the Broadway production, with Tom Wopat returning as Frank Butler.

===2000 U.S. tour===
The 1999 Broadway production, in a &quot;slightly revised version&quot;, toured in a U.S. national tour starting in Dallas, Texas, on July 25, 2000, with Marilu Henner and Rex Smith. Tom Wopat joined the tour in late October 2000, replacing Smith.

===2006 Prince Music Theater production===
In 2006, the Prince Music Theater of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, revived the 1966 Lincoln Center Theater version for one month. This production starred Andrea McArdle (the original Annie of the 1977 Broadway musical &quot;Annie&quot;), Jeffrey Coon as Frank Butler, John Scherer as Charlie Davenport, Chris Councill as Buffalo Bill, Mary Martello as Dolly Tate, and Arthur Ryan as Sitting Bull. The production was well received by critics. The production was directed by Richard M. Parison, Jr. and choreographed by Mercedes Ellington.

===2009 London revival===

Jane Horrocks, Julian Ovenden and director Richard Jones mounted a major London revival at the Young Vic, Waterloo. The show opened at the off west end venue on October 16, 2009, initially booking until January 2, 2010, but with an extra week added due to popular demand. The production featured new arrangements by Jason Carr for a band consisting four pianos. London&#x27;s Guardian newspaper awarded the show 5 stars, claiming that &quot;Richard Jones&#x27;s brilliant production offers the wittiest musical staging London has seen in years.&quot;

===2010 Ravinia Festival concert===
A concert staging of the original version of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; took place at the Ravinia Festival, Chicago from August 13–15, 2010 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Annie Oakley&#x27;s birth. Directed by Lonny Price, the concert starred Patti LuPone as Annie, Patrick Cassidy as Frank and George Hearn as Buffalo Bill. The concert received unanimously strong reviews, notably for LuPone and Price&#x27;s direction.

===Other major productions===
Lucie Arnaz starred in a production in the summer of 1978 with Harve Presnell at the Jones Beach Theater in Nassau County, New York. This was the first major production of the musical done in the New York area after the 1966 revival.

The Paper Mill Playhouse produced a well-reviewed production in June 1987 starring Judy Kaye as Annie and Richard White as Frank.

In 2004, Marina Prior and Scott Irwin starred in an Australian production of the 1999 Broadway rewrite of the show.

In 2014 Carter Calvert and David Weitzer starred in a production that opened the Algonquin Arts Theatre&#x27;s 2014-2015 Broadway Season. It was also the first show to be performed after the Algonquin underwent the task of installing new seating which had not been done since 1938.

In October 2015, a two night concert version was presented at the New York City Center Gala starring Megan Hilty (Annie Oakley) and Andy Karl (Frank Butler). The concerts are directed by John Rando, and the cast features Judy Kaye (Dolly Tate), Ron Raines (Buffalo Bill), Brad Oscar (Charlie) and Chuck Cooper (Pawnee Bill).

In April 2023, a one night concert version was presented at The London Palladium starring Rachel Tucker (Annie Oakley) and Oliver Savile (Frank Butler). The concert was directed by Emma Butler, with musical direction by Adam Hoskins. It was produced by Lambert Jackson Productions. 

==Film and television versions==
In 1950, Metro Goldwyn Mayer made a well-received movie version of the musical. Although MGM purchased the rights to the film version with an announced intention of starring legendary singer-actress Judy Garland as Annie, early work on the film was plagued with difficulties, some attributed to Garland&#x27;s health. Garland was fired and replaced by the brassier, blonde Betty Hutton.

In 1957, a production starring Mary Martin as Annie and John Raitt as Frank Butler was broadcast on NBC. In 1967, the Lincoln Center production described above, starring Ethel Merman and Bruce Yarnell, was broadcast on NBC. The Mary Martin version has been re-broadcast sporadically over the years, but the 1967 videotapes starring Ethel Merman have apparently been irretrievably lost. Only a video and audio clip of &quot;I Got the Sun in the Mornin&#x27; (and the Moon at Night)&quot; is known to exist, as does an audio-only recording of the entire 90-minute show.

==Recordings==
There are several recordings of the &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; score, including:

==Reception==
The original Broadway production opened to favorable reviews. Critics unanimously praised Ethel Merman&#x27;s performance as Annie Oakley, though some thought the score and book were not particularly distinguished. John Chapman of the &quot;Daily News&quot; declared that the production had &quot;good lyrics and tunes by Irving Berlin...[and] the razzle-dazzle atmosphere of a big-time show&quot; but pronounced Merman the best part of the show, stating &quot;She is a better comedienne than she ever was before&quot;, stating that &quot;&quot;Annie&quot; is a good, standard, lavish, big musical and I&#x27;m sure it will be a huge success--but it isn&#x27;t the greatest show in the world&quot;. Louis Kronenberger of &quot;PM&quot; stated that the show was &#x27;in many ways routine&quot;, but greatly praised Merman&#x27;s performance, opining, &quot;For me, &quot;Annie&quot; is mainly Miss Merman&#x27;s show, though the rest of it is competent enough of its kind...Irving Berlin&#x27;s score is musically not exciting--of the real songs, only one or two are tuneful&quot;.
Ward Morehouse of &quot;The New York Sun&quot; declared, &quot;The big news about &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; is that it reveals Ethel Merman in her best form since &quot;Anything Goes&quot;...She shouts the Berlin music with good effect. She often comes to the aid of a sagging book&quot;. He stated, &quot;Irving Berlin&#x27;s score is not a notable one, but his tunes are singable and pleasant and his lyrics are particularly good. The book? It&#x27;s on the flimsy side, definitely. And rather witless too&quot;. Lewis Nichols of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;It has a pleasant score by Irving Berlin...and it has Ethel Merman to roll her eyes and to shout down the rafters. The colors are pretty, the dancing is amiable and unaffected, and Broadway by this time is well used to a book which doesn&#x27;t get anywhere in particular&quot;.

However, the show itself was greatly lauded by some critics: Vernon Rice of the &quot;New York Post&quot; proclaimed, &quot;Irving Berlin has outdone himself this time. No use trying to pick a hit tune, for all the tunes are hits...Ethel Merman is at her lusty, free and easy best...She is now able to develop a consistent characterization and stay with it to the show&#x27;s end. And when she opens her mouth to sing, she sings!&quot; William Hawkins of the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; said that Merman was &quot;bright as a whip, sure as her shooting, and generously the foremost lady clown of her time&quot; and asserted that the show itself was comparable to those of Rodgers and Hammerstein, proclaiming, &quot;For verve and buoyancy, unslackening, there has seldom if ever been a show like it...the girls in &quot;Annie&quot; have the beauty and character of looks one associates with a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. And the production has in every way the distinction that has become their hallmark&quot;.

Historians have viewed the show as inaccurate, citing among other reasons its portrayal of Annie as a loud, boisterous character, when in reality she had a quiet personality and did needlepoint in her spare time.

== Redface ==

Native Americans have criticized the show&#x27;s portrayal of Redface and promotion of cultural stereotypes. The song &quot;I&#x27;m an Indian Too&quot; is seen as particularly offensive; Annie sings that song after the character Sitting Bull adopts her into the Sioux tribe.

Native Americans did protest outside the New York theatre, as well as movie theaters, holding picket signs stating: &quot;Don&#x27;t See &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;. Many contemporary productions have omitted the song from their revivals, both in response to the stereotypes in the lyrics, as well as part of an overall restructuring of the musical for modern audiences.

The Native American comedy group The 1491s used the song in one of their satirical videos posted on YouTube. Directed and edited by Sterlin Harjo and starring Ryan Red Corn as &quot;Hipster in a Headdress Mascot,&quot; the video plays with both the reality and the stereotypes of people who identify as Indian. The video is set in Santa Fe, New Mexico, during the annual Indian Market held there; the market itself features original art by highly praised Native artists, but some vendors also sell extremely stereotyped kitsch with supposedly Native themes or patterns. Part of the satire, as well, is that Ryan Red Corn does not look stereotypically Indian; he is filmed dancing to the tune of &quot;I&#x27;m an Indian Too&quot; in different places in the market, wearing shorts and a traditional Plains Indian headdress, with the word &quot;Hipster&quot; written in marker on his chest. People have quite different reactions to him and his dancing, with some who clearly get the joke that he is playing a stereotype while others clearly do not.

<text>Stile Project is a website founded by a writer and webmaster known by the pseudonym Jay Stile. Stile started the site in 1999 when he was in high school, and ran it for 12 years. Stile Project grew into a large network of counter-culture, amateur adult entertainment and current-events sites, forums, collectively called &quot;stileNET&quot;. On December 2, 2010, Stile announced that he had sold Stile Project. According to Stile, after selling the website, he went on to study computer science and received his postgraduate academic degree in 2013.

==Content==
&quot;The Register&quot; referred to Stileproject.com as a &quot;shock site&quot; in a 2001 article. The website assembled &quot;vast visual libraries of any taboo or depravity that could be digitized.&quot; In the early 2000s, as &quot;the Web&#x27;s leading repository of crude filth – probably the most reliable source of tastelessness in the history of the Internet,&quot; its content was criticized for its shock value. One example was a video showing a Korean villager killing, cooking, and eating a cat was highly publicized and denounced by PETA, who sought a federal investigation, which did not occur. Stile reportedly faked his own suicide live on webcam in 1999, and he confirmed the hoax in 2012.

Open-source software and porn were &quot;memorialized in J. Stile&#x27;s hoard of erotic Linux Slut images&quot;. As the site evolved, it survived what Stile reported was webhost troubles, and a major hacking incident. By 2004 AlterNet wrote that it and other similar shock sites &quot;aren&#x27;t grossing out teenagers anymore.&quot;

==Awards==
Stile Project won Webby Awards in 2000 for &quot;Weird&quot; site and &quot;People&#x27;s Voice&quot; winner.

==Associations==
* Stile is a former member of the underground art scene groups ACiD, DARK and iCE. His specialty was designing ANSI logos for art group projects and bulletin board systems in the early 1990s.
* In 2006, Canadian poet Daniel Scott Tysdal cited Stile Project (December 2004) as a stanza in his poetry collection &quot;Predicting the Next Big Advertising Breakthrough Using a Potentially Dangerous Method&quot;.

<doc id="286351" wikidata="Q5615425" url="?curid=286351" title="Guide (hypertext)">
<text>Guide was a hypertext system developed by Peter J. Brown at the University of Kent in 1982. The original Guide implementation was for Three Rivers PERQ workstations running Unix. The Guide system became the third hypertext system to be sold commercially, marketed by Office Workstations Ltd (OWL) in 1984 and later by InfoAccess. It won Brown the British Computer Society&#x27;s award for technical innovation in 1988. He retired in 1999 and died of cancer in 2007, according to a tribute page at the University of Kent website.

Ian Ritchie, founder of OWL, presented a TED talk in 2011 describing his missed opportunity to convert Guide to a graphical browser for the Web at its inception in 1990, titled &quot;The day I turned down Tim Berners-Lee&quot;.

In September 1986, Guide was ported by OWL to the Apple Macintosh, and in July 1987 to Microsoft Windows. (In 1987, Apple had begun giving away its own graphical programming system, HyperCard, which had some hypertext features.) According to news reports in 1988, OWL announced plans to release a version of Guide for the IBM PS/2 line of computers under the name &quot;Hyper Document&quot;, to compete with HyperCard on the Apple Macintosh.

OWL gradually shifted the focus of Guide from a low-cost hypertext word processor to a more expensive CD-ROM multimedia development system.

Unlike most hypertext systems, the main link mechanism in Guide is based on &quot;replacement&quot;, meaning that when following a link, the current node breaks open, making room for the destination node. The anchor of the link is replaced by the contents of the destination node, like an expanded node in an outliner, but without the restraint of a hierarchical outline. One can close the destination node, which means that it is once again replaced by the text of the anchor. Thus, the basic method of navigation using Guide was the expansion button, by which a section was replaced when selected and expansion provided additional levels of detail. This allowed the user, whether a document author or a reader, to expand and contract a document, viewing the desired level at any time, not unlike viewing methods used in Adobe Acrobat files. This method required a hierarchical document structure.

Guide supported pop-ups for small annotations, and jumps, which behaved like the follow-link operation in most hypertexts (as in van Dam&#x27;s FRESS system). The jumps allowed for the non-hierarchical link creation.

<text>In the teaching of the Catholic Church, an indulgence (, from , &#x27;permit&#x27;) is &quot;a way to reduce the amount of punishment one has to undergo for (forgiven) sins&quot;. The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; describes an indulgence as &quot;a remission before God of the temporal punishment due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven, which the faithful Christian who is duly disposed gains under certain prescribed conditions…&quot;

The recipient of an indulgence must perform an action to receive it. This is most often the saying (once, or many times) of a specified prayer, but may also include a pilgrimage, the visiting of a particular place (such as a shrine, church, or cemetery), or the performance of specific good works.

Indulgences were introduced to allow for the remission of the severe penances of the early church and granted at the intercession of Christians awaiting martyrdom or at least imprisoned for the faith. The Catholic church teaches that indulgences draw on the treasury of merit accumulated by Jesus&#x27;s death on the cross and the virtues and penances of the saints. They are granted for specific good works and prayers in proportion to the devotion with which those good works are performed or prayers recited.

By the late Middle Ages, indulgences were used to support charities for the public good, including hospitals. However, the abuse of indulgences for almsgiving, so that they became a method of moneyraising or ignored the requirements for contrition or charity, had become a serious problem which the church recognized but was unable to restrain effectively. Abuses in the practise and teaching on indulgences were, from the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, a target of attacks by Martin Luther and other Protestant theologians. Eventually, the Catholic Counter-Reformation curbed the abuses of indulgences, but indulgences continue to play a role in modern Catholic religious life, and were dogmatically confirmed as part of the Catholic faith by the Council of Trent. In 1567, Pope Pius V forbade tying indulgences to any financial act, even to the giving of alms. Reforms in the 20th century largely abolished the quantification of indulgences, which had been expressed in terms of days or years. These days or years were meant to represent the equivalent of time spent in penance, although it was widely mistaken to mean time spent in Purgatory. The reforms also greatly reduced the number of indulgences granted for visiting particular churches and other locations.

==Catholic teaching==

Catholic teaching states that when a person sins, they acquire the liability of guilt and the liability of punishment. A mortal sin, one that is grave or serious in nature and is committed knowingly and freely, is considered to be an active refusal of communion with God, and to separate a person from him to the end of suffering the eternal death of hell as an effect of this rejection, a consequence known as the &quot;eternal punishment&quot; of sin. The Sacrament of Penance removes this guilt and the liability of eternal punishment related to mortal sin.

The forgiveness of sin and restoration of communion with God entail the remission of the eternal punishment of sin, but the temporal punishment of sin remains. An example of this can be seen in 2 Samuel 12, when, after David repents of his sin, the prophet Nathan tells him that he is forgiven, but, &quot;Thus says the Lord God of Israel:...Now, therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah to be your wife.&quot;

In addition to the eternal punishment due to mortal sin, every sin, including venial sin, is a turning away from God through what the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; calls an &quot;unhealthy attachment to creatures&quot;, an attachment that must be purified either here on earth, or after death in the state called purgatory. &quot;The process of sanctification and interior renewal requires not only forgiveness from the guilt (&quot;culpa&quot;) of sin, but also purification from the harmful effects or wounds of sin.&quot; This purification process gives rise to &quot;temporal punishment&quot;, because, not involving a total rejection of God, it is not eternal and can be expiated. Catholic teaching states that the temporal punishment of sin should be accepted as a grace, and that the sinner &quot;should strive by works of mercy and charity, as well as by prayer and the various practices of penance, to put off completely the &#x27;old man&#x27; and to put on the &#x27;new man&#x27;.&quot;

The temporal punishment that follows sin is thus undergone either during life on earth or in purgatory. In this life, as well as by patient acceptance of sufferings and trials, the necessary cleansing from attachment to creatures may, at least in part, be achieved by turning to God in prayer and penance and by works of mercy and charity. Indulgences (from the Latin verb , meaning &quot;to forgive&quot;, &quot;to be lenient toward&quot;) are a help towards achieving this purification.

An indulgence does not forgive the guilt of sin, nor does it provide release from the eternal punishment associated with unforgiven mortal sins. The Catholic Church teaches that indulgences relieve only the temporal punishment resulting from the effect of sin (the effect of rejecting God the source of good), and that a person is still required to have their grave sins absolved, ordinarily through the sacrament of Confession, to receive salvation. Similarly, an indulgence is not a permit to commit sin, a pardon of future sin, nor a guarantee of salvation for oneself or for another. Ordinarily, forgiveness of mortal sins is obtained through Confession (also known as the sacrament of penance or reconciliation).

According to the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, &quot;The &#x27;treasury of the Church&#x27; is the infinite value, which can never be exhausted, which Christ&#x27;s merits have before God. They were offered so that the whole of mankind could be set free from sin and attain communion with the Father. ... In Christ, the Redeemer himself, the satisfactions and merits of his Redemption exist and find their efficacy. ...This treasury includes as well the prayers and good works of the Blessed Virgin Mary. They are truly immense, unfathomable, and even pristine in their value before God. In the treasury, too, are the prayers and good works of all the saints, all those who have followed in the footsteps of Christ the Lord and by his grace have made their lives holy and carried out the mission in the unity of the Mystical Body.&quot;

Pursuant to the church&#x27;s understanding of the power of binding or loosing granted by Christ, it administers to those under its jurisdiction the benefits of these merits in consideration of prayer or other pious works undertaken by the faithful. In opening for individual Christians its treasury, &quot;the Church does not want simply to come to the aid of these Christians, but also to spur them to works of devotion, penance, and charity&quot;.

Consistent with this, Peter J. Beer, SJ, writes in &quot;Theological Studies&quot;:

Before the Second Vatican Council, stating that an indulgence of 40 days, 300 days or 7 years has been gained did not mean that a soul in Purgatory avoided a temporal punishment of 40 days, 300 days or 7 years; it meant, instead, that a soul in Purgatory avoided a temporal punishment of the same duration as that which it would have served with a traditional canonical penance of 40 days, 300 days or 7 years.

===Dispositions necessary to gain an indulgence===
An indulgence is not the purchase of a pardon which secures the buyer&#x27;s salvation or releases the soul of another from purgatory. Sin is only pardoned (i.e., its effects entirely obliterated) when complete reparation in the form of sacramental confession is made and prescribed conditions are followed. After a firm amendment is made internally not to sin again, and the serious execution of one&#x27;s assigned penance, the release of one from penalty in the spiritual sense consequentially follows.

An indulgence may be plenary (remits all temporal punishment required to cleanse the soul from attachment to anything but God) or partial (remits only part of the temporal punishment, i.e. cleansing, due to sin).

To gain a plenary indulgence, upon performing the charitable work or praying the aspiration or prayer for which the indulgence is granted, one must fulfill the prescribed conditions of:
# A complete and whole-hearted detachment from all sin of any kind, even venial sin
# Making a valid sacramental confession 
# Receiving Holy Communion in the state of grace
# Praying for the intentions of the Pope.

The minimum condition for gaining a partial indulgence is to be contrite in heart; on this condition, a Catholic who performs the work or recites the prayer in question is granted, through the church, remission of temporal punishment equal to that obtained by the person&#x27;s own action.

Since those who have died in the state of grace (with all mortal sins forgiven) are members of the communion of saints, the living (members of the Church Militant) can assist those whose purification from their sins was not yet completed at the time of death through prayer but also by obtaining indulgences in their behalf. Since the church has no jurisdiction over the dead, indulgences can be gained for them only , i.e. by an act of intercession. This is sometimes termed &#x27;impetration&#x27;, which Aquinas explains &quot;...is not founded on God&#x27;s justice, but on His goodness&quot;.

On August 28, 1903, Pope Pius X allowed cardinals in their titular churches and dioceses to grant 200 days of indulgence; archbishops, 100; bishops, 50.

=== Present discipline ===

By the apostolic constitution of 1 January 1967, Pope Paul VI, responding to suggestions made at the Second Vatican Council, substantially revised the practical application of the traditional doctrine.
Paul VI made it clear that the Catholic Church&#x27;s aim was not merely to help the faithful make due satisfaction for their sins, but chiefly to bring them to greater fervour of charity. For this purpose he decreed that partial indulgences, previously granted as the equivalent of a certain number of days, months, quarantines (forty-day periods) or years of canonical penance, simply supplement, and to the same degree, the remission that those performing the indulgenced action already gain by the charity and contrition with which they do it.

The abolition of the classification by years and days made it clearer than before that repentance and faith are required not only for remission of eternal punishment for mortal sin but also for remission of temporal punishment for sin. In , Pope Paul VI wrote that indulgences cannot be gained without a sincere conversion of outlook and unity with God.

In the same bill, Pope Paul ordered that the official list of indulgenced prayers and good works, called the &quot;Raccolta&quot;, be revised &quot;with a view to attaching indulgences only to the most important prayers and works of piety, charity and penance&quot;. The &quot;Raccolta&quot; was replaced with the . While a number of indulgenced prayers and good works were removed from the list, it now includes new general grants of partial indulgences that apply to a wide range of prayerful actions, and it indicates that the prayers that it does list as deserving veneration on account of divine inspiration or antiquity or as being in widespread use are only examples of those to which the first of these general grants applies: &quot;Raising the mind to God with humble trust while performing one&#x27;s duties and bearing life&#x27;s difficulties, and adding, at least mentally, some pious invocation&quot;. In this way, the , in spite of its smaller size, classifies as indulgenced an immensely greater number of prayers than were treated as such in the &quot;Raccolta&quot;.

Canons 992–997 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law provide a general regulation of indulgences.

====Subjects who have the power to grant indulgences====
Both partial and plenary indulgences can be granted by the diocesan bishop or eparch, by the major archbishop, metropolitan and patriarch, by the cardinal, as well as by the Pope and the Apostolic Penitentiary.

For patriarchs this applies in the individual localities of the patriarchate, in churches that follow the specific rite of the patriarchate beyond its borders, and everywhere for the faithful of their own rite.

Cardinal bishops enjoy the faculty of granting only partial indulgence in any place. This indulgence can be purchased only by those who are present in the individual places from time to time.

====Actions for which indulgences are granted====
=====Partial indulgences=====
There are four general grants of indulgence, which are meant to encourage the faithful to infuse a Christian spirit into the actions of their daily lives and to strive for perfection of charity. These indulgences are partial, and their worth therefore depends on the fervour with which the person performs the recommended actions:
# Raising the mind to God with humble trust while performing one&#x27;s duties and bearing life&#x27;s difficulties, and adding, at least mentally, some pious invocation.
# Devoting oneself or one&#x27;s goods compassionately in a spirit of faith to the service of one&#x27;s brothers and sisters in need.
# Freely abstaining in a spirit of penance from something licit and pleasant.
# Freely giving open witness to one&#x27;s faith before others in particular circumstances of everyday life.

According to the 1968 Enchiridion of Indulgences, a partial indulgence is granted to the faithful for the following actions if done in conjunction with the receiving of the Sacraments of Communion and Penance as well as praying an intention for the Pope:
* making an act of faith, hope, charity, contrition, or spiritual communion
* spending some time in mental prayer
* penitentially praying such prayers as the…
** Hidden God (Adoro te devote)
** To You O Blessed Joseph (Ad te beate Ioseph)
** certain prayers from the Roman Breviary (We Give You Thanks, Lord God Almighty, Let Us Pray for our Sovereign Pontiff, O Sacred Banquet, Holy Mary Help of the Helpless, Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, Visit We Beg You O Lord)
** Angel of God
** Angel of the Lord
** Soul of Christ (Anima Christi)
** Hear Us (Roman Ritual)
** May it Please you O Lord
** Eternal Rest
** Hail Holy Queen
** We Fly To Your Patronage
** Come Holy Spirit
** Litany of the Name of Jesus, of the Heart of Jesus, of the Blood of Jesus, of the Virgin Mary, of Saint Joseph, or of All Saints
** Little Office of the Passion, of the Heart of Jesus, of the Immaculate Conception, or of Saint Joseph
** Apostles&#x27; Creed 
** Nicene Creed 
** Lauds or Vespers of the Office of the Dead 
** Psalm 50
** Psalm 129
** Magnificat
** Memorare (Remember O Most Gracious Virgin Mary)
* teaching or learning Christian doctrine
* visiting a Christian catacomb
* praying for sacerdotal or religious vocations
* praying for the return of non-Catholic Christians to the Catholic Church
* making the Sign of the Cross
* renewal of baptismal promises

=====Plenary indulgences=====
Among the particular grants, which, on closer inspection, will be seen to be included in one or more of the four general grants, especially the first, the draws special attention to four activities for which a plenary indulgence can be gained on any day, though only once a day:
# Piously reading or listening to Sacred Scripture for at least half an hour.
# Adoration of Jesus in the Eucharist for at least half an hour.
# The pious exercise of the Stations of the Cross.
# Recitation of the Rosary or the Akathist in a church or oratory, or in a family, a religious community, an association of the faithful and, in general, when several people come together for an honourable purpose.

The prayers specifically mentioned in the are not of the Latin Church tradition alone, but also from the traditions of the Eastern Catholic Churches, such as the Akathistos, Paraklesis, &quot;Evening Prayer&quot;, and &quot;Prayer for the Faithful Departed&quot; (Byzantine), &quot;Prayer of Thanksgiving&quot; (Armenian), &quot;Prayer of the Shrine&quot; and the &quot;Lakhu Mara&quot; (Chaldean), &quot;Prayer of Incense&quot; and &quot;Prayer to Glorify Mary the Mother of God&quot; (Coptic), &quot;Prayer for the Remission of Sins&quot; and &quot;Prayer to Follow Christ&quot; (Ethiopian), &quot;Prayer for the Church&quot;, and &quot;Prayer of Leave-taking from the Altar&quot; (Maronite), and &quot;Intercessions for the Faithful Departed&quot; (Syrian).

Besides the above actions, the 1968 Enchiridion of Indulgences lists the following actions as granting a plenary indulgence:
* First Communion
* first Mass of a newly ordained priest

======Special indulgences======
A plenary indulgence may also be gained on some occasions, which are not everyday occurrences. They include but are not limited to:
* Receiving, even by radio or television, the blessing given by the Pope (&#x27;to the city [of Rome] and to the world&#x27;) or that which a bishop is authorized to give three times a year to the faithful of his diocese.
* Taking part devoutly in the celebration of a day devoted on a world level to a particular religious purpose. Under this heading come the annual celebrations such as the World Day of Prayer for Vocations, and occasional celebrations such as World Youth Day.
*Taking part for at least three full days in a spiritual retreat.
*Taking part in some functions during the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity.

Special indulgences are also granted on occasions of particular spiritual significance such as a jubilee year or the centenary or similar anniversary of an event such as the apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes.

======Apostolic Blessing======
Of particular significance is the plenary indulgence attached to the Apostolic Blessing that a priest is to impart when giving the sacraments to a person in danger of death, and which, if no priest is available, the church grants to any rightly disposed Christian at the moment of death, on condition that that person was accustomed to say some prayers during life. In this case the church itself makes up for the three conditions normally required for a plenary indulgence: sacramental confession, Eucharistic communion and prayer for the Pope&#x27;s intentions.

=====Coronavirus plenary indulgences=====

On 20 March 2020, the Apostolic Penitentiary issued three plenary indulgences. 
* The first indulgence was for victims of COVID-19 and those helping them. The actions that the indulgence was attached to included praying the rosary, the Stations of the Cross, or at least praying the Creed, Lord&#x27;s Prayer, and a Marian prayer. 
*The second plenary indulgence was for the victims of COVID-19 at their hour of death.
*The third indulgence was for those who made an offering for an &quot;end of the epidemic, relief for those who are afflicted and eternal salvation for those whom the Lord has called to Himself.&quot; The offering was either a visit to the Eucharist, Eucharistic adoration, Rosary, Stations of the Cross, Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, or reading the Bible for half an hour. 
The Penitentiary took the extraordinary step of loosening the requirements regarding sacramental Communion and Confession, due to the impossibility of carrying them out in a timely fashion during lockdowns and suspension of liturgies in the pandemic. The Vatican has also reminded Catholics that, in cases where sacramental confession is impossible, an act of perfect contrition grants one forgiveness of sin.

==History==

===Early and medieval beliefs===
In the early church, especially from the third century on, ecclesiastic authorities allowed a confessor or a Christian awaiting martyrdom to intercede for another Christian in order to shorten the other&#x27;s canonical penance.
During the Decian persecution, many Christians obtained signed statements () certifying that they had sacrificed to the Roman gods in order to avoid persecution or confiscation of property. When these lapsi later wished to once again be admitted to the Christian community, some of the lapsi presented a second purported to bear the signature of some martyr or confessor who, it was held, had the spiritual prestige to reaffirm individual Christians. Bishop Cyprian of Carthage insisted that none of the lapsi be admitted without sincere repentance.

The Council of Epaone, in what is now France, witnessed in 517 to the rise of the practice of replacing severe canonical penances with a new milder penance: its 29th canon reduced to two years the penance that apostates were to undergo on their return to the church, but obliged them to fast one day in three during those two years, to come to church and take their place at the penitents&#x27; door, and to leave with the catechumens. Any who objected to the new arrangement was to observe the much longer ancient penance.

The 6th century saw the development in Ireland of Penitentials, handbooks for confessors in assigning penance. The Penitential of Cummean counseled a priest to take into consideration in imposing a penance, the penitent&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses. Some penances could be commuted through payments or substitutions. It became customary to commute penances to less demanding works, such as prayers, alms, fasts and even the payment of fixed sums of money depending on the various kinds of offenses (tariff penances). While the sanctions in early penitentials, such as that of Gildas, were primarily acts of mortification or in some cases excommunication, the inclusion of fines in later compilations derive from secular law.

By the 10th century, some penances were not replaced but merely reduced in connection with pious donations, pilgrimages, and similar meritorious works. Then, in the 11th and 12th centuries, the recognition of the value of these works began to become associated not so much with canonical penance but with remission of the temporal punishment due to sin. A particular form of the commutation of penance was practiced at the time of the Crusades when the confessor required the penitent to go on a Crusade in place of some other penance. The earliest record of a plenary indulgence was Pope Urban II&#x27;s declaration at the Council of Clermont (1095) that he remitted all penance incurred by crusaders who had confessed their sins in the Sacrament of Penance, considering participation in the crusade equivalent to a complete penance. This set the pattern for all crusade indulgences going forward.

Theologians looked to God&#x27;s mercy, the value of the church&#x27;s prayers, and the merits of the saints as the basis on which indulgences could be granted. Around 1230 the Dominican Hugh of St-Cher proposed the idea of a &quot;treasury&quot; at the church&#x27;s disposal, consisting of the infinite merits of Christ and the immeasurable abundance of the saints&#x27; merits, a thesis that was demonstrated by great scholastics such as Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas and remains the basis for the theological explanation of indulgences.

Indulgences were intended to offer remission of the temporal punishment due to sin equivalent to that someone might obtain by performing a canonical penance for a specific period of time. As Purgatory became more prominent in Christian thinking, the idea developed that the term of indulgences related to remission of time in Purgatory. Indeed, many Late Medieval indulgences were for terms well over a human lifetime, reflecting this belief. For several centuries it was debated by theologians whether penance or purgatory was the currency of the indulgences granted, and the church did not settle the matter definitively, for example avoiding doing so at the Council of Trent. The modern view of the church is that the term is penance.

===Late Medieval usage===

Indulgences became increasingly popular in the Middle Ages as a reward for displaying piety and doing good deeds, though, doctrinally speaking, the Catholic Church stated that the indulgence was only valid for temporal punishment for sins already forgiven in the Sacrament of Confession. In addition, indulgences were granted for acts of almsgiving, as well as prayer, pilgrimages and fasts. Because indulgences granted for almsgiving seemed to some like a simple monetary transaction, rather than seeing the indulgence as granted for the good deed itselfthe act of charity done for a hospital, orphanage or churchmany began to see indulgences for almsgiving as simply &quot;buying&quot; or &quot;purchasing&quot; indulgences. The faithful asked that indulgences be given for saying their favourite prayers, doing acts of devotion, attending places of worship, and going on pilgrimage; confraternities wanted indulgences for putting on performances and processions; associations demanded that their meetings be rewarded with indulgences. Good deeds included charitable donations of money for a good cause, and money thus raised was used for many causes, both religious and civil; building projects funded by indulgences include churches, hospitals, leper colonies, schools, roads, and bridges.

However, in the later Middle Ages growth of considerable abuses occurred. Some commissaries sought to extract the maximum amount of money for each indulgence. Professional &quot;pardoners&quot; ( in Latin) – who were sent to collect alms for a specific project – practiced the unrestricted sale of indulgences. Many of these exceeded official church doctrine, and promised rewards such as salvation from eternal damnation in return for money. With the permission of the church, indulgences also became a way for Catholic rulers to fund expensive projects, such as Crusades and cathedrals, by keeping a significant portion of the money raised from indulgences in their lands. There was a tendency to forge documents declaring that indulgences had been granted. Indulgences grew to extraordinary magnitude, in terms of longevity and breadth of forgiveness.

The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) suppressed some abuses connected with indulgences, spelling out, for example, that only a one-year indulgence would be granted for the consecration of churches and no more than a 40-days indulgence for other occasions. The Council also stated that &quot;Catholics who have girded themselves with the cross for the extermination of the heretics, shall enjoy the indulgences and privileges granted to those who go in defense of the Holy Land.&quot;

Very soon these limits were widely exceeded. False documents were circulated with indulgences surpassing all bounds: indulgences of hundreds or even thousands of years. In 1392, more than a century before Martin Luther published the Ninety-five Theses, Pope Boniface IX wrote to the Bishop of Ferrara condemning the practice of certain members of religious orders who falsely claimed that they were authorized by the pope to forgive all sorts of sins, and obtained money from the simple-minded faithful by promising them perpetual happiness in this world and eternal glory in the next. The &quot;Butter Tower&quot; of Rouen Cathedral earned its nickname because the money to build it was raised by the sale of indulgences allowing the use of butter during Lent.
An engraving by Israhel van Meckenem of the &quot;Mass of Saint Gregory&quot; contained a &quot;bootlegged&quot; indulgence of 20,000 years; one of the copies of this plate (not the one illustrated, but also from the 1490s) was altered in a later state to increase it to 45,000 years. The indulgences applied each time a specified collection of prayers – in this case seven each of the Creed, Our Father, and Hail Mary – were recited in front of the image. The image of the &quot;Mass of Saint Gregory&quot; had been especially associated with large indulgences since the jubilee year of 1350 in Rome, when it was at least widely believed that an indulgence of 14,000 years had been granted for praying in the presence of the (&quot;Man of Sorrows&quot;), a popular pilgrimage destination in the basilica of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in Rome.

===Protestant Reformation===

The scandalous conduct of the &quot;pardoners&quot; was an immediate occasion of the Protestant Reformation. In 1517, Pope Leo X offered indulgences for those who gave alms to rebuild St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome.

The aggressive marketing practices of Johann Tetzel in promoting this cause provoked Martin Luther to write his Ninety-five Theses, condemning what he saw as the purchase and sale of salvation. In Thesis 28 Luther objected to a saying attributed to Tetzel: &quot;As soon as a coin in the coffer rings, a soul from purgatory springs&quot;. The Ninety-five Theses not only denounced such transactions as worldly but denied the pope&#x27;s right to grant pardons on God&#x27;s behalf in the first place: the only thing indulgences guaranteed, Luther said, was an increase in profit and greed, because the pardon of the church was in God&#x27;s power alone.

This oft-quoted saying was by no means representative of the official Catholic teaching on indulgences, but rather, more a reflection of Tetzel&#x27;s capacity to exaggerate. Yet if Tetzel overstated the matter in regard to indulgences for the dead, his teaching on indulgences for the living was pure. A German Catholic historian of the Papacy, Ludwig von Pastor, explains:
Tetzel denied preaching this, writing in 1518 that &quot;Whoever says that a soul cannot rise to heaven before the money rings in the box, commits an error.&quot;: i.e., his &quot;as soon as&quot; says the benefit is instant not exclusive. August Wilhelm Dieckhoff also argued against Tetzel&#x27;s corruption, writing that he only preached &quot;orthodox Catholic teaching on indulgences and Protestants have been grossly misled about this man&quot;.

While Luther initially did not deny the pope&#x27;s right to grant pardons for penance imposed by the church, he made it clear that preachers who claimed indulgences absolved those who obtained them from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error, in agreement with Catholic theology. In Article 71, Luther asserted apostolic pardons.

Erasmus also criticized the abuse of indulgences in his foreword to his (1530), where he stated that it appeared to be &quot;nothing but a commercial transaction&quot; and described how the money that was collected disappeared in the hands of princes, officials, commissaries, and confessors.

Historian Peter Marshall states that Luther did not oppose the idea of indulgences directly, as he conceded that &quot;bishops and parish priests are bound to admit commissaries of the apostolic indulgences with all reverence&quot; and cautioned that &quot;one should not hinder someone from buying them&quot;. Luther was solely concerned with the theological matters, and argued against the indulgences as to advance his concept of salvation by faith alone (sola fide). Luther also doubted whether a soul in purgatory was guaranteed to achieve salvation at all, eventually rejecting the existence of purgatory as a whole; this was contrary to the teaching of the Catholic Church and its Doctors, such as Thomas Aquinas. As such, Marshall argues that &quot;Luther did not deny that indulgences were useful, or that the pope’s intentions in issuing them were good&quot;, but merely objected to them because of his theological views rather than the alleged corruption of the Church. Contemporary German humanist Johann Cochlaeus argued that &quot;Luther was not genuinely moved by concerns about abuses in the preaching of indulgences&quot;. The idea of indulgences as the underlying cause of the Reformation and a symbol of the Catholic Church&#x27;s corruption was also disputed by Lutheran theologians such as August Wilhelm Dieckhoff and . Marshall clarifies the nature of the indulgences at the time of the Reformation, writing:
===Council of Trent===

On 16 July 1562, the Council of Trent suppressed the office of and reserved the collection of alms to two canon members of the chapter, who were to receive no remuneration for their work; it also reserved the publication of indulgences to the bishop of the diocese. Then, on 4 December 1563, in its final session, the Council addressed the question of indulgences directly, declaring them &quot;most salutary for the Christian people&quot;, decreeing that &quot;all evil gains for the obtaining of them be wholly abolished&quot;, and instructing bishops to be on the watch for any abuses concerning them.

A few years later, in 1567, Pope Pius V canceled all grants of indulgences involving any fees or other financial transactions. This meant that indulgences would continue to be attached to virtuous acts of prayer, piety and pilgrimages, but no longer would they be attached to almsgiving, because the potential for abuse of such indulgences was deemed too great.

After the Council of Trent, Clement VIII established a commission of Cardinals to deal with indulgences according to the mind of the Council. It continued its work during the pontificate of Paul V and published various bulls and decrees on the matter. However, only Clement IX established a true Congregation of Indulgences (and Relics) with a Brief of 6 July 1669. In a on 28 January 1904, Pius X joined the Congregation of Indulgences with that of Rites, but with the restructuring of the Roman Curia in 1908 all matters regarding indulgences were assigned to the Holy Inquisition. In a on 25 March 1915, Benedict XV transferred the Holy Inquisition&#x27;s Section for Indulgences to the Apostolic Penitentiary, but maintained the Holy Inquisition&#x27;s responsibility for matters regarding the doctrine of indulgences.

==Eastern Orthodox Church==
The Eastern Orthodox Churches believe one can be absolved from sins by the Sacred Mystery of Confession. Because of differences in the theology of salvation, indulgences for the remission of temporal punishment of sin currently do not exist in Eastern Orthodoxy, but until the twentieth century there existed in some places a practice of absolution certificates ( – ) which was essentially identical to indulgences, and in many cases much more extravagant.

Some of these certificates were connected with any patriarch&#x27;s decrees lifting some serious ecclesiastical penalty, including excommunication, for the living or the dead. However, because of the expense of maintaining the Holy Places and paying the many taxes levied on them, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, with the approval of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, had the sole privilege of distributing such documents in large numbers to pilgrims or sending them elsewhere, sometimes with a blank space for the name of the beneficiary, living or dead, an individual or a whole family, for whom the prayers would be read.

Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem Dositheos Notaras (1641–1707) wrote: &quot;It is an established custom and ancient tradition, known to all, that the Most Holy Patriarchs give the absolution certificate ( – ) to the faithful people ... they have granted them from the beginning and still do.&quot;

Starting from the 16th century, Orthodox Christians of the Greek Church rather extensively, although not officially in penitential practice, used &quot;permissive letters&quot; (), in many ways similar to indulgences. The status of an official ecclesiastical document is obtained at the Council of Constantinople in 1727, the resolution of which reads: &quot;The power of the abandonment of sins, which, if filed in writing, which the Eastern Church of Christ calls &quot;permissive letters&quot;, and the Latin people &quot;indulgences&quot;... is given by Christ in the holy Church. These &quot;permissive letters&quot; are issued throughout the catholic (universal) Church by the four holiest patriarchs: Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.&quot; From the 13th to the 17th centuries, it was used in Russia. Indulgences as a means of enrichment were condemned at the Council of Constantinople in 1838. Even conciliar decisions had difficulty eradicating the practice of indulgences, rooted in the people. &quot;Permissive letters&quot; (or indulgences) survived in Greece until the mid-20th century.

<text>A pneumothorax is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases, a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, and the amount of air in the space between chest wall and lungs increases; this is called a tension pneumothorax. This can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. This leads to a type of shock called obstructive shock, which can be fatal unless reversed. Very rarely, both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a &quot;collapsed lung&quot;, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.
A primary spontaneous pneumothorax is one that occurs without an apparent cause and in the absence of significant lung disease. A secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung disease. Smoking increases the risk of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, while the main underlying causes for secondary pneumothorax are COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A traumatic pneumothorax can develop from physical trauma to the chest (including a blast injury) or from a complication of a healthcare intervention.
Diagnosis of a pneumothorax by physical examination alone can be difficult (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions that can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup of blood in the pleural space), pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bulla may look similar on a chest X-ray.
A small spontaneous pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach may be most appropriate in people who have no underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.

==Signs and symptoms==
A primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) tends to occur in a young adult without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms. Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features. In newborns tachypnea, cyanosis and grunting are the most common presenting symptoms. People who are affected by a PSP are often unaware of the potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention. PSPs more commonly occur during changes in atmospheric pressure, explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters. It is rare for a PSP to cause a tension pneumothorax.

Secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, occur in individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs tend to be more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.

Traumatic pneumothorax most commonly occurs when the chest wall is pierced, such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space, or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises the integrity of the involved structures. Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma, with only rib fractures being more common in this group. The pneumothorax can be occult (not readily apparent) in half of these cases, but may enlarge – particularly if mechanical ventilation is required. They are also encountered in people already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason.

Upon physical examination, breath sounds (heard with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side, partly because air in the pleural space dampens the transmission of sound. Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations to the surface of the chest may be altered. Percussion of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant (like a booming drum), and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can both be noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the pneumothorax may not be well correlated with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim, and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small.

===Tension pneumothorax===
Tension pneumothorax is generally considered to be present when a pneumothorax (primary spontaneous, secondary spontaneous, or traumatic) leads to significant impairment of respiration and/or blood circulation. This causes a type of circulatory shock, called obstructive shock. Tension pneumothorax tends to occur in clinical situations such as ventilation, resuscitation, trauma, or in people with lung disease. It is a medical emergency and may require immediate treatment without further investigations (see Treatment section).

The most common findings in people with tension pneumothorax are chest pain and respiratory distress, often with an increased heart rate (tachycardia) and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in the initial stages. Other findings may include quieter breath sounds on one side of the chest, low oxygen levels and blood pressure, and displacement of the trachea away from the affected side. Rarely, there may be cyanosis, altered level of consciousness, a hyperresonant percussion note on examination of the affected side with reduced expansion and decreased movement, pain in the epigastrium (upper abdomen), displacement of the apex beat (heart impulse), and resonant sound when tapping the sternum.

Tension pneumothorax may also occur in someone who is receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case it may be difficult to spot as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent studies have shown that the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.

==Cause==
===Primary spontaneous===
Spontaneous pneumothoraces are divided into two types: &quot;primary&quot;, which occurs in the absence of known lung disease, and &quot;secondary&quot;, which occurs in someone with underlying lung disease. The cause of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown, but established risk factors include being of the male sex, smoking, and a family history of pneumothorax. Smoking either cannabis or tobacco increases the risk. The various suspected underlying mechanisms are discussed below.

===Secondary spontaneous===
Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in the setting of a variety of lung diseases. The most common is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which accounts for approximately 70% of cases. The following known lung diseases may significantly increase the risk for pneumothorax.

In children, additional causes include measles, echinococcosis, inhalation of a foreign body, and certain congenital malformations (congenital pulmonary airway malformation and congenital lobar emphysema).

11.5% of people with a spontaneous pneumothorax have a family member who has previously experienced a pneumothorax. Several hereditary conditions – Marfan syndrome, homocystinuria, Ehlers–Danlos syndromes, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (which leads to emphysema), and Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome – have all been linked to familial pneumothorax. Generally, these conditions cause other signs and symptoms as well, and pneumothorax is not usually the primary finding. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome is caused by mutations in the &quot;FLCN&quot; gene (located at chromosome 17p11.2), which encodes a protein named folliculin. &quot;FLCN&quot; mutations and lung lesions have also been identified in familial cases of pneumothorax where other features of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are absent. In addition to the genetic associations, the HLA haplotype A2B40 is also a genetic predisposition to PSP.

===Traumatic===
A traumatic pneumothorax may result from either blunt trauma or penetrating injury to the chest wall. The most common mechanism is the penetration of sharp bony points at a new rib fracture, which damages lung tissue. Traumatic pneumothorax may also be observed in those exposed to blasts, even when there is no apparent injury to the chest.

Traumatic pneumothoraces may be classified as &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot;. In an open pneumothorax, there is a passage from the external environment into the pleural space through the chest wall. When air is drawn into the pleural space through this passageway, it is known as a &quot;sucking chest wound&quot;. A closed pneumothorax is when the chest wall remains intact.

Pneumothorax was reported as an adverse event caused by misplaced nasogastric feeding tubes. Avanos Medical&#x27;s feeding tube placement system, the CORTRAK* 2 EAS, was recalled in May 2022 by the FDA due to adverse events reported, including pneumothorax, leading to 60 injuries and 23 people dying as communicated by the FDA.

Medical procedures, such as inserting a central venous catheter into one of the chest veins or taking biopsy samples from lung tissue, may also lead to pneumothorax. The administration of positive pressure ventilation, either mechanical ventilation or non-invasive ventilation, can result in barotrauma (pressure-related injury) leading to a pneumothorax.

Divers who breathe from an underwater apparatus are supplied with breathing gas at ambient pressure, which results in their lungs containing gas at higher than atmospheric pressure. Divers breathing compressed air (such as when scuba diving) may develop a pneumothorax as a result of barotrauma from ascending just while breath-holding with their lungs fully inflated. An additional problem in these cases is that those with other features of decompression sickness are typically treated in a diving chamber with hyperbaric therapy; this can lead to a small pneumothorax rapidly enlarging and causing features of tension.

=== Newborn infants ===
Pneumothorax is more common in neonates than in any other age group. The incidence of symptomatic neonatal is estimated to be around 1-3 per 1000 live births. Prematurity, low birth weight and asphyxia are the major risk factors, and a majority of newborn infant cases occur during the first 72 hours of life.

=== Artificial Pneumothorax ===
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, physicians namely Carlo Forlanini, a physician from Italy, began experimenting with intentionally collapsing the lungs of patients infected with tuberculosis. The goal of treatment was to deprive the oxygen dependent mycobacterium of the resources it requires to multiply and spread. Although this method fell out of common practice following the advent of pharmaceutical advancements, some research shows that in cases where medications are not effective, AP has successful results. However, the same complications that arise with other mechanisms may still apply, leading to questions of risk vs. benefit. 

==Mechanism==
The thoracic cavity is the space inside the chest that contains the lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. On each side of the cavity, a pleural membrane covers the surface of lung (visceral pleura) and also lines the inside of the chest wall (parietal pleura). Normally, the two layers are separated by a small amount of lubricating serous fluid. The lungs are fully inflated within the cavity because the pressure inside the airways (intrapulmonary pressure) is higher than the pressure inside the pleural space (intrapleural pressure). Despite the low pressure in the pleural space, air does not enter it because there are no natural connections to air-containing passages, and the pressure of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the pleural space. Therefore, a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter, through damage to the chest wall or to the lung itself, or occasionally because microorganisms in the pleural space produce gas. Once air enters the pleural cavity, the intrapleural pressure increases, resulting in the difference between the intrapulmonary pressure and the intrapleural pressure (defined as the transpulmonary pressure) to equal zero, which cause the lungs to deflate in contrast to a normal transpulmonary pressure of ~4 mm Hg.

Chest-wall defects are usually evident in cases of injury to the chest wall, such as stab or bullet wounds (&quot;open pneumothorax&quot;). In secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces, vulnerabilities in the lung tissue are caused by a variety of disease processes, particularly by rupturing of bullae (large air-containing lesions) in cases of severe emphysema. Areas of necrosis (tissue death) may precipitate episodes of pneumothorax, although the exact mechanism is unclear. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) has for many years been thought to be caused by &quot;blebs&quot; (small air-filled lesions just under the pleural surface), which were presumed to be more common in those classically at risk of pneumothorax (tall males) due to mechanical factors. In PSP, blebs can be found in 77% of cases, compared to 6% in the general population without a history of PSP. As these healthy subjects do not all develop a pneumothorax later, the hypothesis may not be sufficient to explain all episodes; furthermore, pneumothorax may recur even after surgical treatment of blebs. It has therefore been suggested that PSP may also be caused by areas of disruption (porosity) in the pleural layer, which are prone to rupture. Smoking may additionally lead to inflammation and obstruction of small airways, which account for the markedly increased risk of PSPs in smokers. Once air has stopped entering the pleural cavity, it is gradually reabsorbed.

Tension pneumothorax occurs when the opening that allows air to enter the pleural space functions as a one-way valve, allowing more air to enter with every breath but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume (size of each breath), worsening the problem. Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) and respiratory arrest eventually follow.

==Diagnosis==
The symptoms of pneumothorax can be vague and inconclusive, especially in those with a small PSP; confirmation with medical imaging is usually required. In contrast, tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency and may be treated before imaging – especially if there is severe hypoxia, very low blood pressure, or an impaired level of consciousness. In tension pneumothorax, X-rays are sometimes required if there is doubt about the anatomical location of the pneumothorax.

===Chest X-ray===

A plain chest radiograph, ideally with the X-ray beams being projected from the back (posteroanterior, or &quot;PA&quot;), and during maximal inspiration (holding one&#x27;s breath), is the most appropriate first investigation. It is not believed that routinely taking images during expiration would confer any benefit. Still, they may be useful in the detection of a pneumothorax when clinical suspicion is high but yet an inspiratory radiograph appears normal. Also, if the PA X-ray does not show a pneumothorax but there is a strong suspicion of one, lateral X-rays (with beams projecting from the side) may be performed, but this is not routine practice.

It is not unusual for the mediastinum (the structure between the lungs that contains the heart, great blood vessels, and large airways) to be shifted away from the affected lung due to the pressure differences. This is &quot;not&quot; equivalent to a tension pneumothorax, which is determined mainly by the constellation of symptoms, hypoxia, and shock.

The size of the pneumothorax (i.e. the volume of air in the pleural space) can be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy by measuring the distance between the chest wall and the lung. This is relevant to treatment, as smaller pneumothoraces may be managed differently. An air rim of 2 cm means that the pneumothorax occupies about 50% of the hemithorax. British professional guidelines have traditionally stated that the measurement should be performed at the level of the hilum (where blood vessels and airways enter the lung) with 2 cm as the cutoff, while American guidelines state that the measurement should be done at the apex (top) of the lung with 3 cm differentiating between a &quot;small&quot; and a &quot;large&quot; pneumothorax. The latter method may overestimate the size of a pneumothorax if it is located mainly at the apex, which is a common occurrence. The various methods correlate poorly but are the best easily available ways of estimating pneumothorax size. CT scanning (see below) can provide a more accurate determination of the size of the pneumothorax, but its routine use in this setting is not recommended.

Not all pneumothoraces are uniform; some only form a pocket of air in a particular place in the chest. Small amounts of fluid may be noted on the chest X-ray (hydropneumothorax); this may be blood (hemopneumothorax). In some cases, the only significant abnormality may be the &quot;deep sulcus sign&quot;, in which the normally small space between the chest wall and the diaphragm appears enlarged due to the abnormal presence of fluid.

===Computed tomography===

A CT scan is not necessary for the diagnosis of pneumothorax, but it can be useful in particular situations. In some lung diseases, especially emphysema, it is possible for abnormal lung areas such as bullae (large air-filled sacs) to have the same appearance as a pneumothorax on chest X-ray, and it may not be safe to apply any treatment before the distinction is made and before the exact location and size of the pneumothorax is determined. In trauma, where it may not be possible to perform an upright film, chest radiography may miss up to a third of pneumothoraces, while CT remains very sensitive.

A further use of CT is in the identification of underlying lung lesions. In presumed primary pneumothorax, it may help to identify blebs or cystic lesions (in anticipation of treatment, see below), and in secondary pneumothorax, it can help to identify most of the causes listed above.

===Ultrasound===
Ultrasound is commonly used in the evaluation of people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be more sensitive than chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the chest. Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification of the size of the pneumothorax. Several particular features on ultrasonography of the chest can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.

==Treatment==
The treatment of pneumothorax depends on a number of factors and may vary from discharge with early follow-up to immediate needle decompression or insertion of a chest tube. Treatment is determined by the severity of symptoms and indicators of acute illness, the presence of underlying lung disease, the estimated size of the pneumothorax on X-ray, and – in some instances – on the personal preference of the person involved.

In traumatic pneumothorax, chest tubes are usually inserted. If mechanical ventilation is required, the risk of tension pneumothorax is greatly increased and the insertion of a chest tube is mandatory. Any open chest wound should be covered with an airtight seal, as it carries a high risk of leading to tension pneumothorax. Ideally, a dressing called the &quot;Asherman seal&quot; should be utilized, as it appears to be more effective than a standard &quot;three-sided&quot; dressing. The Asherman seal is a specially designed device that adheres to the chest wall and, through a valve-like mechanism, allows air to escape but not to enter the chest.

Tension pneumothorax is usually treated with urgent needle decompression. This may be required before transport to the hospital, and can be performed by an emergency medical technician or other trained professional. The needle or cannula is left in place until a chest tube can be inserted. Critical care teams are able to incise the chest to create a larger conduit as performed when placing a chest drain, but without inserting the chest tube. This is called a simple thoracostomy. If tension pneumothorax leads to cardiac arrest, needle decompression or simple thoracostomy is performed as part of resuscitation as it may restore cardiac output.

===Conservative===
Small spontaneous pneumothoraces do not always require treatment, as they are unlikely to proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax, and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small (defined as &lt;50% of the volume of the hemithorax), there is no breathlessness, and there is no underlying lung disease. It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited. Admission to hospital is often not required, as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient, at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below). Estimated rates of resorption are between 1.25% and 2.2% the volume of the cavity per day. This would mean that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks. There is, however, no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non conservative management.

Secondary pneumothoraces are only treated conservatively if the size is very small (1 cm or less air rim) and there are limited symptoms. Admission to the hospital is usually recommended. Oxygen given at a high flow rate may accelerate resorption as much as fourfold.

===Aspiration===
In a large PSP (&gt;50%), or in a PSP associated with breathlessness, some guidelines recommend that reducing the size by aspiration is equally effective as the insertion of a chest tube. This involves the administration of local anesthetic and inserting a needle connected to a three-way tap; up to 2.5 liters of air (in adults) are removed. If there has been significant reduction in the size of the pneumothorax on subsequent X-ray, the remainder of the treatment can be conservative. This approach has been shown to be effective in over 50% of cases. Compared to tube drainage, first-line aspiration in PSP reduces the number of people requiring hospital admission, without increasing the risk of complications.

Aspiration may also be considered in secondary pneumothorax of moderate size (air rim 1–2 cm) without breathlessness, with the difference that ongoing observation in hospital is required even after a successful procedure. American professional guidelines state that all large pneumothoraces – even those due to PSP – should be treated with a chest tube. Moderately sized iatrogenic traumatic pneumothoraces (due to medical procedures) may initially be treated with aspiration.

===Chest tube===

A chest tube (or intercostal drain) is the most definitive initial treatment of a pneumothorax. These are typically inserted in an area under the axilla (armpit) called the &quot;safe triangle&quot;, where damage to internal organs can be avoided; this is delineated by a horizontal line at the level of the nipple and two muscles of the chest wall (latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major). Local anesthetic is applied. Two types of tubes may be used. In spontaneous pneumothorax, small-bore (smaller than 14 F, 4.7 mm diameter) tubes may be inserted by the Seldinger technique, and larger tubes do not have an advantage. In traumatic pneumothorax, larger tubes (28 F, 9.3 mm) are used. When chest tubes are placed due to either blunt or penetrating trauma, antibiotics decrease the risks of infectious complications.

Chest tubes are required in PSPs that have not responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (&gt;50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a water seal, or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of pulmonary edema (&quot;re-expansion pulmonary edema&quot;). The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from it for a period of time, and X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.

If after 2–4 days there is still evidence of an air leak, various options are available. Negative pressure suction (at low pressures of –10 to –20 cmH2O) at a high flow rate may be attempted, particularly in PSP; it is thought that this may accelerate the healing of the leak. Failing this, surgery may be required, especially in SSP.

Chest tubes are used first-line when pneumothorax occurs in people with AIDS, usually due to underlying pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), as this condition is associated with prolonged air leakage. Bilateral pneumothorax (pneumothorax on both sides) is relatively common in people with pneumocystis pneumonia, and surgery is often required.

It is possible for a person with a chest tube to be managed in an ambulatory care setting by using a Heimlich valve, although research to demonstrate the equivalence to hospitalization has been of limited quality.

===Pleurodesis and surgery===
Pleurodesis is a procedure that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results in the short term are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.

A less invasive approach is thoracoscopy, usually in the form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The results from VATS-based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery. VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall.

If a chest tube is already in place, various agents may be instilled through the tube to achieve chemical pleurodesis, such as talc, tetracycline, minocycline or doxycycline. Results of chemical pleurodesis tend to be worse than when using surgical approaches, but talc pleurodesis has been found to have few negative long-term consequences in younger people.

===Aftercare===
If pneumothorax occurs in a smoker, this is considered an opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation. It may be advisable for someone to remain off work for up to a week after a spontaneous pneumothorax. If the person normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.

Air travel is discouraged for up to seven days after complete resolution of a pneumothorax if recurrence does not occur. Underwater diving is considered unsafe after an episode of pneumothorax unless a preventive procedure has been performed. Professional guidelines suggest that pleurectomy be performed on both lungs and that lung function tests and CT scan normalize before diving is resumed. Aircraft pilots may also require assessment for surgery.

=== Neonatal period ===
For newborn infants with pneumothorax, different management strategies have been suggested including careful observation, thoracentesis (needle aspiration), or insertion of a chest tube. Needle aspiration may reduce the need for a chest tube, however, the effectiveness and safety of both invasive procedures have not been fully studied.

==Prevention==
A preventative procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended after an episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation of the risk of recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery may need to be considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides (&quot;bilateral&quot;), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.

==Epidemiology==
The annual age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) of PSP is thought to be three to six times as high in males as in females. Fishman cites AAIR&#x27;s of 7.4 and 1.2 cases per 100,000 person-years in males and females, respectively. Significantly above-average height is also associated with increased risk of PSP – in people who are at least 76 inches (1.93 meters) tall, the AAIR is about 200 cases per 100,000 person-years. Slim build also seems to increase the risk of PSP.

The risk of contracting a first spontaneous pneumothorax is elevated among male and female smokers by factors of approximately 22 and 9, respectively, compared to matched non-smokers of the same sex. Individuals who smoke at higher intensity are at higher risk, with a &quot;greater-than-linear&quot; effect; men who smoke 10 cigarettes per day have an approximate 20-fold increased risk over comparable non-smokers, while smokers consuming 20 cigarettes per day show an estimated 100-fold increase in risk.

In secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, the estimated annual AAIR is 6.3 and 2.0 cases per 100,000 person-years for males and females, respectively, with the risk of recurrence depending on the presence and severity of any underlying lung disease. Once a second episode has occurred, there is a high likelihood of subsequent further episodes. The incidence in children has not been well studied, but is estimated to be between 5 and 10 cases per 100,000 person-years.

Death from pneumothorax is very uncommon (except in tension pneumothoraces). British statistics show an annual mortality rate of 1.26 and 0.62 deaths per million person-years in men and women, respectively. A significantly increased risk of death is seen in older people and in those with secondary pneumothoraces, when the lung collapses due to another underlying health condition such as chronic lung disease.

==History==
An early description of traumatic pneumothorax secondary to rib fractures appears in &quot;Imperial Surgery&quot; by Turkish surgeon Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu (1385–1468), which also recommends a method of simple aspiration.

Pneumothorax was described in 1803 by Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, a student of René Laennec, who provided an extensive description of the clinical picture in 1819. While Itard and Laennec recognized that some cases were not due to tuberculosis (then the most common cause), the concept of spontaneous pneumothorax in the absence of tuberculosis (primary pneumothorax) was reintroduced by the Danish physician Hans Kjærgaard in 1932. In 1941, the surgeons Tyson and Crandall introduced pleural abrasion for the treatment of pneumothorax.

Prior to the advent of anti-tuberculous medications, pneumothoraces were intentionally caused by healthcare providers in people with tuberculosis in an effort to collapse a lobe, or entire lung, around a cavitating lesion. This was known as &quot;resting the lung&quot;. It was introduced by the Italian surgeon Carlo Forlanini in 1888 and publicized by the American surgeon John Benjamin Murphy in the early 20th century (after discovering the same procedure independently). Murphy used the (then) recently discovered X-ray technology to create pneumothoraces of the correct size.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;pneumothorax&quot; comes from Greek &quot;&quot; &#x27;air&#x27; and &quot;thorax&quot; &#x27;chest&#x27;. Its plural is &quot;pneumothoraces&quot;.

==Other animals==
Non-human animals may experience both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax is divided into open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete and there is a direct connection between the two halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal&#x27;s chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube. For spontaneous pneumothorax the use of CT for diagnosis has been described for dogs and Kunekune pigs.

<text>The Ramon Magsaysay Award (Filipino: &quot;Gawad Ramon Magsaysay&quot;) is an annual award established to perpetuate former Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay&#x27;s example of integrity in governance, courageous service to the people, and pragmatic idealism within a democratic society. The prize was established in April 1957 by the trustees of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund based in New York City with the concurrence of the Philippine government. It is often called the &quot;Nobel Prize of Asia&quot;.

==History==
In May 1957, seven prominent Filipinos were named to the founding board of trustees of the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation, the non-profit corporation tasked with implementing the awards program. Later on, the board of trustees diversified and included prominent Asians from all over the Asian continent and outlying islands. The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation gives the prize to Asian individuals achieving excellence in their respective fields.

The award is named after Ramon Magsaysay, the seventh president of the Philippines. This has generated criticism due to allegations of brutal suppression of dissent and subserviency to the US government during Magsaysay&#x27;s tenure as defense secretary and president.

==Award categories==
The award recognizes and honors individuals and organizations in Asia regardless of race, creed, sex, or nationality, who have achieved distinction in their respective fields and have helped others generously without anticipating public recognition.

The awards used to be given in six categories, five of which were discontinued in 2009:
* Government Service (1958–2008)
* Public Service (1958–2008)
* Community Leadership (1958–2008)
* Journalism, Literature, and Creative Communication Arts (1958–2008)
* Peace and International Understanding (1958–2008)
* Emergent Leadership (since 2001)

== Awardees ==
The winners of the Ramon Magsaysay Awards come from different parts of Asia, although there are some instances where the winners came from countries outside Asia who had served, worked or accomplished something in different Asian countries. As of 2021, recipients have come from twenty-two Asian countries.

The following is a partial list of the awardees of the Ramon Magsaysay Award. Awardees&#x27; individual nationality or country of origin and citizenship are indicated.

Starting 2009, the Award is no longer being given in fixed categories except for Emergent Leadership.

===Government Service (1958–2008)===
To recognize outstanding service in the public interest in any branch of government, including the executive, judicial, legislative, or military.

===Public Service (1958–2008)===
To recognize outstanding service for the public good by a private citizen.

===Community Leadership (1958–2008)===
To recognize leadership of a community toward helping the disadvantaged have fuller opportunities and a better life.

=== Journalism, Literature, and the Creative Communication Arts (1958–2008) ===
To recognize effective writing, publishing, or photography or the use of radio, television, cinema, or the performing arts as a power for the public good.

===Peace and International Understanding (1958–2008)===
To recognize contributions to the advancement of friendship, tolerance, peace, and solidarity as the foundations for sustainable development within and across countries.

===Emergent Leadership (2001–present)===
To recognize an individual, forty years of age or younger, for outstanding work on issues of social change in his or her community, but whose leadership may not yet be broadly recognized outside of this community.

===Uncategorized (2009–present)===

<doc id="286363" wikidata="Q1136829" url="?curid=286363" title="INSEAD">
<text>INSEAD ( ) is a non-profit business school with locations in Europe (Fontainebleau, France), Asia (Singapore), the Middle East (Abu Dhabi, UAE) and North America (San Francisco, USA).

As a graduate-only business school, INSEAD offers a full-time Master of Business Administration, an Executive MBA (EMBA), an Executive Master in Finance, a Master in Management, an Executive Master in Change, a PhD in management, a Business Foundations post-graduate certificate and a variety of Executive education programmes.

==History==
INSEAD was founded in 1957 by venture capitalist Georges Doriot, Claude Janssen, and Olivier Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. Original seed money was provided by the Paris Chamber of Commerce. The school was originally based in the Château de Fontainebleau before locating to its current Europe Campus in 1967. The original name of the school was &quot;Institut Européen d&#x27;Administration des Affaires’ which was later shortened to INSEAD. 

In 2000, the school opened a second campus in Singapore, and in 2007, it established a Centre in Abu Dhabi primarily for research and executive education, which later achieved campus status in 2010. In 2020, INSEAD opened the INSEAD San Francisco Hub for Business Innovation.

In 2012, INSEAD joined the Sorbonne University Alliance as a founding member, collaborating with other specialized institutions to contribute to the development of a leading multidisciplinary university.

==Degree programmes==
Specialised Master&#x27;s degree programs are offered in Management (INSEAD Master in Management program), an MBA program, Master in Change, Master in Finance, and a PhD program.

==Rankings and reputation==

<doc id="286365" wikidata="Q3874642" url="?curid=286365" title="List of official languages of international organizations">
<text>This is a list of official languages of international organizations. Different organizations sometimes refer to their principal languages of administration and communication as &quot;working languages&quot;, while others refer to these as being &quot;official&quot;. No distinction is made here, except where an organization itself, distinguishes between its official and working languages.

English and French are often regarded as the symbolic official languages, although the former has gained prominence in recent years.

==International==
According to a recent study of multilingualism in 13 major international organizations (Commonwealth, ICC, ILO, IMF, IOC, IPU, ITU, OECD, UN, UPU, WB, WHO, and WTO), English is an official language in almost all (12). This is followed by French (10); Spanish (6); and Arabic, Chinese, and Russian (3 each). Interpretation is offered in Japanese and German as well for 2 organizations.

The six official languages of the United Nations reflects the languages of the permanent members of the Security Council (Chinese, English, French, and Russian), in addition to Arabic and Spanish. Another study found that the percentage of each language used at each United Nations meeting in 2010 was distributed as follows: English (98%), French (87%), Spanish (34%), Russian (10%), Arabic (7%), and Chinese (3%).

The following is a list of major international and inter-governmental organizations.

<text>The Ford Crown Victoria (&quot;Crown Vic&quot;) is a full-size sedan that was marketed and manufactured by Ford. The successor to the Ford LTD Crown Victoria, two generations of the model line were produced from the 1992 until the 2012 model years. The Ford counterpart of the Mercury Grand Marquis, the Crown Victoria was the largest sedan marketed by Ford in North America, slotted above the Ford Taurus. The Crown Victoria Police Interceptor (1992–2011) was marketed specifically for law-enforcement use; a long-wheelbase Crown Victoria sedan (2002–2011) was marketed primarily for taxi cab fleets.

The Crown Victoria was produced on the rear-wheel drive, body-on-frame Ford Panther platform, sharing its chassis with the Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Car. From 1997 until their 2011 discontinuation, the three model lines were the sole four-door sedans produced in North America with a full-length frame, rear-wheel drive, and a standard V8 engine. While the front and rear crumple zones were engineered into the vehicle, it was one of Ford&#x27;s products that were not of unibody construction for the entire generation. The Crown Victoria was the last car made using the Ford Panther platform.

For its entire production, the Crown Victoria was produced by Ford Canada alongside the Grand Marquis at St. Thomas Assembly in Southwold, Ontario. From 1991 until 2011, over 1.5 million cars (including Police Interceptors) were produced by St. Thomas Assembly prior to its closure. A 2012 Crown Victoria (intended for Middle East export) was the final vehicle produced by the facility. Following the discontinuation of the model line, the Crown Victoria was not directly replaced, with the full-size Ford Taurus serving as the next basis for Ford police cars.

==Origin of name ==
Prior to the 1992 model year, Ford used the Crown Victoria nameplate on two vehicles; both were flagship models of their full-size model range. From 1955 until 1956, the nameplate was used for premium two-door Ford Fairlanes. For 1980, the nameplate returned as the top trim of Ford LTD sedans, denoting all Ford full-size sedans in North America from 1983 through 1991.

A styling feature used for both versions is a stainless-steel band trimming the B-pillars (&quot;crowning&quot; the roof).

===1955–1956===

For 1955, the Ford Fairlane was introduced as the premium Ford model range. Slotted above the Victoria two-door hardtop, the Crown Victoria debuted as the flagship trim of the Fairlane. In place of the popular hardtop roofline, the Crown Victoria was fitted with a B-pillared roofline. Similar to the Mercury XM-800 concept car (though changed in angle), the B-pillar was fitted with a wide stainless-steel band (&quot;crowning&quot; the roof), giving a sleeker appearance to the roofline.

Alongside the standard two-tone roof, the Crown Victoria Skyliner was fitted with a fixed sunroof; a tinted acrylic glass panel formed the entire roof ahead of the B-pillar.

For 1956, the Lifeguard option package was introduced as an option for the Fairlane Crown Victoria (as with all Ford cars).

For the 1957 redesign of the Ford model line, the Crown Victoria was retired from the Fairlane series with no replacement. The Skyliner name made its return in a different form, denoting the Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner retractable hardtop convertible.

===1980–1991===

For the 1980 model year, the Crown Victoria nameplate was revived after a 23-year hiatus, becoming part of the Ford LTD model range. Again, a premium trim of the full-size range (replacing the LTD Landau), the LTD Crown Victoria became two-door and four-door sedans. To distinguish the model line from its Mercury (Grand) Marquis counterpart, Ford revived the stainless-steel band to trim the B-pillars (in heavily revised form); the design was used on examples with the standard vinyl half roof.

For 1983, as part of an extensive revision of the midsize and full-size model lines of all three Ford divisions, the LTD Crown Victoria became a stand-alone model line (alongside its Mercury Grand Marquis counterpart). The Ford LTD nameplate was shifted to the midsize segment, replacing the Ford Granada. While having a separate roofline (separate doors and B-pillar trim) from its sedan counterparts, the LTD Country Squire station wagon shared its interior trim with the Crown Victoria sedan (a non-woodgrain Crown Victoria wagon was also introduced).

Discontinued after the 1991 model year, the LTD Crown Victoria (and LTD Country Squire station wagon) marked the final usage of the Ford LTD nameplate in North America. Ford of Australia produced its own Ford LTD as its flagship model line (derived from its own Fairlane) from 1973 until 2007; as neither Mercury nor Lincoln were officially marketed in Australia, the LTD was developed as a luxury vehicle.

==First generation (EN53; 1992–1997)==
In the first quarter of 1987, development began on a redesign codenamed &quot;EN53&quot;. The Ford Crown Victoria was unveiled on November 28, 1990, and began production in January 1991 as a 1992 model, launching on March 21, 1991. Fleet sales of the vehicle were postponed for 14 months to maximize availability for buyers at launch. In line with the redesign of the 1991 Chevrolet Caprice (its chief competitor), the 1992 Crown Victoria featured a major exterior redesign, while retaining the previous-generation chassis. Ford reduced the coefficient of drag of the exterior from 0.42 to 0.34 (nearly matching the 0.32 of the Ford Taurus) to enhance aerodynamics and fuel efficiency, giving the first generation Crown Victoria its sleek, wedge-shaped design that came to be known as the &quot;aero&quot; look.

Due to a market shift in family-oriented vehicles, the Crown Victoria was offered exclusively as a four-door sedan, with the wood-trimmed LTD Country Squire station wagon discontinued. While the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable continued in production with optional three-row seating, the Country Squire was essentially replaced by the Ford Aerostar, Ford Econoline/Club Wagon, and Ford Explorer.

Ford benefitted from a unique loophole in CAFE standards when the 1992 Crown Victoria and its Grand Marquis twin were launched. To avoid paying gas-guzzler taxes, Ford modified its supplier network so that the two vehicles could be classified as imports from Canada, effectively removing the full-size sedans from the Ford domestic CAFE fleet (alongside the Ford Mustang V8) and placing them in its imported fleet (alongside the Ford Festiva).

=== Chassis ===
In lieu of developing an all-new platform architecture, the Crown Victoria retained the Panther platform of its LTD Crown Victoria predecessor. Although launched in 1978, the Panther chassis underwent extensive upgrades to improve its road manners and handling; major updates were made to the steering and suspension tuning. To improve braking performance, the Crown Victoria gained four-wheel disc brakes, which were only seen on the Lincoln Mark VII, Ford Taurus SHO, and Ford Escort GT (1991-1996). Available as options, anti-lock brakes and low-speed traction control became popular features. For 1997, several updates were made to improve handling response and steering control

Showcased in the redesign was the new Modular V8 engine. First introduced in the 1991 Lincoln Town Car, the 4.6 L SOHC V8 replaced the overhead-valve small block V8 and was the first of a family of overhead-cam engines that would eventually appear in several Ford and Lincoln-Mercury cars and trucks. Lighter than its predecessor, the 4.6 engine produced nearly identical torque output while producing 40 additional horsepower in its standard single-exhaust configuration. As with its predecessor and the Lincoln Town Car, the 4.6 was paired with a four-speed overdrive automatic transmission. In 1993, the Ford AOD transmission was replaced by the electronically controlled AOD-E version. For 1995, the AOD-E was replaced by the 4R70W, a heavier-duty version introduced in the Lincoln Mark VIII.

=== Body ===

Ford based much of the Crown Victoria&#x27;s appearance on the first-generation Ford Taurus, a look pioneered by Ford VP of Design Jack Telnack. Though the Taurus became wildly popular in its market segment, Telnack&#x27;s &quot;aero&quot; look proved to be either a love or hate proposition with potential buyers of the Crown Victoria. Along with its distinctive no-grille front fascia, the Crown Victoria shared a similar roofline with the Taurus, similar body and bumper moldings, similar door handles, aircraft-style doors, and similarly shaped headlamp and taillamp clusters. To reduce aesthetic commonality with the Mercury Grand Marquis, only the front doors, windshield, and alloy wheels were shared between them.

For the interior, the two vehicles also were given different seats, door trim, and dashboards; the Crown Victoria featured an instrument panel with round dials that included voltage and oil-pressure gauges, while the Grand Marquis featured a horizontal speedometer without the full instrumentation. An electronic instrument panel was introduced as an option, featuring a trip computer with two trip odometers, instantaneous and average fuel economy, distance remaining to an empty fuel tank, and outside temperature readout. Though better received than the 1991 redesign of the Chevrolet Caprice, the 1992 Crown Victoria was met with disapproval from some critics and buyers, leading Ford to revise the exterior. For the 1993 model year, a grille was added to the front fascia (though it retained its &quot;bottom-breather&quot; cooling system configuration) and a red reflector strip was added to the trunk lid to visually connect the taillamps. For the 1995 model year, a midcycle redesign had more extensive changes to the Crown Victoria; a 6-six-slot grille replaced the egg-crate design, and wider taillamps were added to the rear with the license plate positioned between them on the trunk lid. Inside, the 1995 Crown Victoria had redesigned seats and a new dashboard, which was now shared with the Grand Marquis. The new design featured larger controls and switches, with the radio enlarged and positioned higher. The gauge cluster retained its previous layout. In late 1995, the first-generation &quot;brick&quot; airbag steering wheel was replaced by one with a smaller hub that returned the horn button to the center of the wheel. For the 1996 model year, the &quot;Crown Victoria&quot; fender script badging was removed.

=== Features ===
As with its LTD Crown Victoria predecessor, the Crown Victoria was a six-passenger automobile; the front seat was a 50/50 split bench seat. The Crown Victoria was sold in two trim levels: base and LX, with the latter forming the majority of non-fleet sales. In addition, the Crown Victoria P71 replaced the fleet-market &quot;S&quot; designation in 1993; the P71 was marketed exclusively for law-enforcement sales.

As with the Mercury Grand Marquis, a driver airbag was standard equipment and a passenger airbag was added as an option during later 1991 production. It later became standard in 1993 for the 1994 model year. Popular features were the antilock brakes and low-speed traction control. For 1996, a single-key entry system became standard, along with a hidden radio antenna, rear window defroster, and tinted glass. Automatic digital climate control and a JBL audio system became available on the LX.

For the 1993 model year, cupholders were added to the pull-out dashboard ashtray drawer, and the date feature was removed from the digital clock. A one-touch down feature was added for the driver&#x27;s door power window as standard equipment, while Ford&#x27;s proprietary door-mounted keypad system, marketed as &quot;Securicode&quot;, as well as an auto-dimming electrochromic rearview mirror, became optional equipment. Audio systems were also updated with an optional JBL sound system with a subwoofer and an optional 10-disc CD changer.

==== Touring Sedan ====

For 1992, Ford introduced the Crown Victoria Touring Sedan as a performance-oriented flagship trim. The Touring Sedan featured a number of suspension and handling improvements over the Crown Victoria LX, featuring the heavier-duty suspension components of the police-package version, and also including wider tires, rear air suspension, removal of the speed limiter, and a 210 hp dual-exhaust variant of the 4.6 L V8. Optional features included speed-sensitive steering and larger-diameter sway bars. Distinguished by its standard two-tone exterior paint scheme (with painted alloy wheels), the Touring Sedan featured a unique leather interior with every feature available on a Crown Victoria at the time. For a lower price, Ford offered the performance upgrades of the Touring Sedan on the LX as the Handling and Performance Package alongside a separate towing package. The Touring Sedan was a one-year-only model, as it was discontinued after 1992. However, the Handling and Performance Package remained an option in various forms until 2007.

=== Production figures ===

==Second generation (EN114; 1998–2012)==

The second-generation Crown Victoria commenced sales on 26 December 1997. Although the previous Ford Crown Victoria had better critical and marketplace acceptance than the controversial styling of the 1991 Chevrolet Caprice, its sales struggled to match those of its Mercury Grand Marquis counterpart. In an effort to gain acceptance among buyers (and increase parts commonality), for the 1998 model year, the Crown Victoria adopted much of the exterior design of the Mercury Grand Marquis.

Following its 1998 introduction, the second-generation Crown Victoria underwent an extensive revision for the 2003 model year. Introduced in April 2002, while the exterior saw no change, nearly the entire chassis was redesigned, with major updates to the suspension and steering.

=== Body ===
The redesigned Crown Victoria adopted the formal notch-back roof-line of its Mercury counterpart, causing it to lose its rear C pillar windows. All four doors were now shared with the Mercury (previously, the front doors were shared). On the front fascia, both the grille and headlamps were enlarged. The rear fascia underwent a redesign, as large tail lamp units were mounted at the corners of the body, replacing the previous full-width design. A fender mounted radio antenna would appear for 2005, but was reversed back to the original rear-windshield unit in 2006. In contrast to its Mercury counterpart, the Crown Victoria had considerably less use of chrome trim. LX Sport models forewent chrome trim altogether, as they adopted a fully monochromatic paint scheme.

=== Interior ===
While a large portion of the interior was retained from the first generation, the 1998 redesign brought some changes to the interior, as the seat design was revised slightly, and the chrome trim found on the column shifter and turn signal switch was deleted. The gauge cluster needles were switched from orange to red, and its backlighting was switched from light blue to green. Ford&#x27;s &quot;Securi-Lock&quot; anti-theft system (PATS) was now standard on all retail models; the move necessitated the switch to a transponder key and a new key-less entry remote. Also, a new two-spoke steering wheel took the place of the former four-spoke design. LX models were now equipped with an 8-way power driver seat that featured a lumbar function and an auto-dimming rear-view mirror with a built-in compass. For the 2000 model year, changes included an emergency trunk release system, a &quot;Belt Minder&quot; (seat belt reminder chime that sounds for an unbelted front seat occupant), and LATCH anchors to comply with US federal safety regulations.

In 2001, the seat-belts were redesigned; the move coincided with the introduction of Ford&#x27;s Personal Safety System, which also included seat position sensors, seat belt pre-tensioners, and dual stage airbags for improved safety. Furthermore, redundant controls for the climate control and radio became optional on LX trim vehicles. Heated side mirrors became standard in 2002, along with floor mats, power pedals, and improved cloth upholstery; for LX-trim vehicles, a trunk storage organizer became an option.

With the 2003 update, the interior saw further revisions. Redesigned door panels, seats, headrests, and new switch-gear modernized it. Wiper-activated headlamps were now standard for all non-police models. A new dual media CD/cassette radio was initially standard, but became optional midway through the 2003 model year. Additionally, side airbags were introduced as an option.

As the model progressed, the interior would continue to see periodic updates. The Crown Victoria was offered with PPG laminated side glass beginning in 2004 to reduce the transmission of UV light in the interior; it was one of the first American vehicles to do so. A new steering wheel design with a non-locking column was introduced in 2005, replacing the design seen since 1998. 2005 also introduced a front passenger weight sensor, which allowed the restraint system to automatically enable or disable the passenger airbag, when necessary. Lastly for 2005, a factory sunroof was made available for LX models.

In 2006, the analog odometer/speedometer setup and the digital dash cluster option was deleted as a new gauge cluster with a tachometer became standard; the Crown Victoria was the last Ford vehicle without a tachometer. On LX models, the new gauge cluster included a message center, which featured a redundant speedometer, distance to empty reading, fuel economy reading, oil life monitor, digital odometer, and compass. For the 2007 model year, the optional side airbags underwent revisions to better protect passengers in side-impact collisions; they were made standard in 2009 along with recessed window switches and power pedals. The final change to the interior came for 2011, where the headrests were redesigned to meet new federal safety standards.

=== Chassis and specification ===
Under the 1998 redesign, multiple changes were made to the Crown Victoria&#x27;s mechanical systems. An updated 4.6L V8 engine now received an increase in horsepower to 200 hp and 215 hp for dual exhaust models. A two-speed electronically controlled radiator fan was introduced along with fail-safe cooling. The ignition system was switched over to a coil-on-plug design (shared with other Modular engines), replacing the dual coil pack design from 1997. Additionally, the radiator overflow tank was moved off the passenger fender well and onto the radiator surround, while the power steering reservoir was moved from the driver-side fender well to the front of the engine block. The 4R70W transmission now mandated the use of Mercon V fluid. Furthermore, the rear suspension was redesigned to improve general road manners (at the expense of reduced towing capacity), as its original three-link coil-spring configuration was replaced with a four-link configuration that featured a Watt&#x27;s linkage. Continuing the use of four-wheel disc brakes, larger brake rotors and new dual-piston front calipers necessitated a shift to 16-inch wheels for all models. Lastly, the traction control system was revamped to work on all speeds. For 1999, ABS became standard on all retail Crown Victoria models.

For the 2001 model year, the 4.6L V8 received new &quot;Performance Improved&quot; (PI) cylinder heads. As a result, horsepower ratings were increased to 220 hp and 235 hp on dual exhaust models. Additionally, ABS once again became optional.

From 1998 through 2004, the 4R70W four-speed automatic was paired with the 4.6 L V8, replaced by the 4R70E for 2005 (the latter designed to accommodate electronic throttle controls); the 4R75W was exclusive to the 2004 Police Interceptor. In 2006, a revised 4R75E transmission became standard on all Crown Victoria models. Most models used a 12-inch torque converter, while 2000-01 Handling and Performance Package and Police Interceptor models from 1999 to 2011 used a higher stall 11.25-inch unit.

=== 2003 Update and re-engineering ===
For the 2003 model year, the Ford Panther platform was re-engineered for the first time since its 1979 introduction. While the Lincoln Town Car and Mercury Grand Marquis saw extensive exterior redesigns, the Crown Victoria retained its exterior design introduced in 1998. However, substantial changes were made to the chassis. A new, fully boxed &amp; hydro-formed frame along with a new aluminum #2 cross-member strengthened chassis rigidity and improved safety. According to Ford, the torsional rigidity of the new frame was increased by 24%, and its resistance to vertical bending was increased by 20%. For the first time, the Crown Victoria adopted speed-sensitive rack and pinion power steering (replacing the long-running recirculating ball system); it increased steering precision and road feel. The suspension was entirely revamped, with the adoption of aluminum front lower control arms, revised front upper control arms, updated steering knuckles, and coil-over front shocks. In the rear, twin-tube shocks (in use since the mid-1960s) were replaced by mono-tube shocks; to improve handling, the shocks were inverted and moved to the outside of the chassis rails. As part of the suspension upgrades, the Panther-chassis vehicles were fitted with high positive offset (flat-face) wheels. ABS once again became standard, as improved brakes were introduced. They featured a quiet EBD brake booster with mechanical panic assist that optimized front-rear brake bias. To add, the entire exhaust system was redesigned, with exhaust hangers now mounted to the frame rails to reduce NVH.

Several changes were also made under the hood, with the 4.6L V8 receiving revised engine tuning and a power increase due to the addition of an engine knock sensor. The engine now produced 224 hp and 239 hp on dual exhaust models; these would be the final horsepower increases for retail and non-police fleet models until the end of production in 2011; police models would however see one final increase to 250 hp in 2004. The engine oil pan was enlarged to 6 U.S. quarts for increased oil life. Additionally, the fuel system was switched over to an electronic return-less system, and the EGR system was revised, which resulted in improved carbon emissions. Several visual changes were also made under the hood, with a new engine cover being introduced that featured a silver &quot;V8&quot; emblem. The power steering reservoir was relocated from the front of the engine and onto the radiator shroud. A quieter, improved variable-speed radiator fan replaced the outgoing two-speed unit. Furthermore, the engine oil fill cap was moved to the passenger side valve cover. Lastly, an accessory belt shield was now mounted to the front of the engine.

There were some minor mechanical changes from 2003 to 2012. The natural gas (NGV) engine option was discontinued for 2005, and the throttle control was switched to drive-by-wire. The switch to electronic throttle control necessitated that the cruise function be moved to the engine computer, which was relocated to the top of the left inner fender. Furthermore, 2005 introduced an improved 31-spline rear axle as well as a heated PCV valve. 2006 saw the introduction of Flex Fuel as an option. In a minor revision for 2008, the engine&#x27;s valve covers were redesigned, and Flex Fuel capability became standard.

==== 2003 Mid-year De-contenting ====
Midway through the 2003 model year, Ford introduced a series of cost-cutting measures to all Panther platform vehicles, which were estimated to save around US$4,000,000 (~$ in ) in production costs per year. The Crown Victoria saw numerous deletions including the removal of the remote locking fuel door, body-colored mirror caps, auto parking brake release, engine compartment lamp, front seat bottom pouches, dual media CD/Cassette radio, power-adjustable pedals (except LX models), foam sound absorbing inserts inside the headliner, black B-pillars (now body-colored), silver &quot;V8&quot; emblem on the engine cover, and the elimination of the rear stabilizer bar on all non Fleet, Handling, or LX Sport versions. Several colors were also deleted: Aspen Green Metallic, Chestnut Clearcoat Metallic, Deep Wedgwood Blue, Gold Ash Metallic, Matador Red, and Silver Frost. These changes took effect in December 2002. The de-contented 2003 vehicles are often referred to as &quot;2003 Job #2&quot; and &quot;2003.5&quot; models.

With falling retail sales and increased focus on other models, the Crown Victoria would continue to see periodic cost-cutting measures: For 2004, the chrome bumper trim strips were deleted along with the passenger-side dual sun-visor, standard heated mirrors (now optional), and the optional trunk organizer. Additionally, Ford&#x27;s proprietary door-mounted keypad system, marketed as its &quot;Securicode&quot;, was deleted from the base model. Base trim versions also lost their chrome exterior door handles in favor of black handles. Moreover, the tail-lamps had their amber turn signal lens deleted, and the four bulb setup was simplified to a two-bulb design with an all red housing. Beginning in 2008, the five-spoke LX Sport wheels became the sole wheel choice for all LX and GCC Export models. In 2009, the exterior side trim was switched to a single design, and side airbags became standard equipment along with power adjustable pedals; all of which were done to streamline production. Further production streamlining occurred for 2010, when all Crown Victoria models received an extended transmission tail-shaft housing (formerly exclusive to the Police Interceptor). As production neared the end, some 2011–12 models were produced with black trunk fascias.

===Trim and Variants===

Carried over from the previous Crown Victoria, the second-generation Crown Victoria was marketed in two trim levels: Ford Crown Victoria (Base) and Ford Crown Victoria LX. The Police Crown Victoria was carried over, with Ford creating the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor as a stand-alone model for the 1999 model year.

Base - Included: Cloth upholstery, manual seats, power locks, key less entry, Securi-Lock anti-theft system (PATS), power windows with automatic drivers side window, solar glass, power remote control mirrors, illuminated entry, steel rims with hubcaps, air conditioning, battery saver, power trunk release, power steering, and an AM/FM stereo with clock (later, a cassette player was added, replaced by a single CD/cassette player, then a single-CD player). Later standard features were a power drivers seat and wiper-activated automatic headlamps. The base Crown Victoria was discontinued following the 2008 model year.

LX - Added: Luxury cloth upholstery, power drivers seat, alloy wheels, leather-wrapped steering wheel, an AM/FM stereo with a cassette player (later, a single CD/cassette player, then just a single-CD player), and illuminated mirrors. Leather seating, dual power seats, and eventually, a sunroof were all options on LX models. Several packages were offered for the LX over the course of the model run including an LX Comfort Package, Premier Package, Special Edition, and Sport (see below).

==== Handling and Performance Package ====
Carried over from the first generation, the Handling and Performance Package (option code 41G) was available on both base and LX models. It included dual exhaust, increased horsepower, shorter rear gears (3.27:1 for most years, 3.55:1 for 2000-mid 01), as well as an upgraded suspension with revised springs, shocks, larger sway bars, and rear air springs. The package also featured lacy-spoke wheels riding on P225/60TR16 tires, and external oil-to-air coolers for both the power steering and transmission. The package was restricted to LX models beginning in 2002. As part of the 2003 update, it received new 16x7 inch &quot;snowflake&quot; wheels. New nine-spoke 16x7 wheels were introduced for the 2006 model year, and the package was discontinued after the 2007 model year; it coincided with the end of retail sales for the model line.

==== LX Sport ====
Initially called Sport Appearance Package, it was introduced in 2001 as a counterpart to the Mercury Grand Marquis LSE. According to Ford, the trim package was aimed at buyers who sought style and improved features. The LX Sport featured all mechanical upgrades found on the Handling and Performance Package. It added an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, heated exterior mirrors, monochromatic exterior trim (on select colors), 17-inch “Sport” wheels, standard leather interior trim, a floor-mounted shifter with center console, front bucket seats, an AM/FM/CD/Cassette radio (the cassette player was eventually deleted), as well as steering wheel controls for the radio and climate control. The LX Sport was renamed to LX Premium Sport Handling and Performance Package in 2007; it was discontinued entirely mid-year 2008. A total of 14,777 LX Sport units were produced over the model run.

====Crown Victoria Police Interceptor (1998–2011)====

Starting with the 1999 model year, the police version of the Crown Victoria, previously named Crown Victoria P71, was changed to Police Interceptor, and new rear badging was assigned instead of the standard Crown Victoria badge. However, the Crown Victoria badge was still affixed to Police Interceptors equipped with the optional Street Appearance Package for vehicles that required ordinary styling.
Compared to the standard Crown Victoria, Police Interceptor models had a host of heavy-duty features that enabled them to be used for emergency response style driving and long idling times. Some of these features included heavy-duty suspension components, larger brakes, a bigger alternator, a shorter rear gear ratio and re-calibrated engine computer for improved acceleration, re-tuned steering with no variable assist, and an external engine oil-to-water cooler. The exterior largely featured black exterior trim with black steel wheels, with the exception of Street Appearance Package models, which donned chrome trim; they looked similar to a base Crown Victoria. During and shortly following its production run, it was the most popular police vehicle in the U.S. and became ubiquitous with law enforcement. Ford has replaced the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor with the Ford Police Interceptor Sedan and Ford Police Interceptor Utility, both of which are heavy-duty variants of the Ford Taurus and Ford Explorer, respectively.

The final Crown Victoria Police Interceptor was produced in August 2011 and purchased by the Kansas Highway Patrol.

==== Long Wheelbase (Taxi/Fleet) ====


In 2002, Ford introduced a long-wheelbase version of the Crown Victoria featuring a six-inch extension to a 120.7-inch wheelbase. As with the extended-wheelbase Lincoln Town Car L, the long-wheelbase Crown Victoria was modified through the use of a longer frame and longer rear doors; all additional interior room was added to the rear seat. Unavailable on retail Crown Victoria models, the seating surfaces had the option of being entirely vinyl, the rear seats had their own HVAC vents with dual on/off switches, and strap handles were added to the rear door panels. Additionally, the long-wheelbase Crown Victoria featured several heavy-duty features to accommodate use in taxi applications including heavy-duty front springs and shocks; a rear stabilizer bar; auxiliary oil to air coolers for both the power steering and transmission; steel wheels (shared with the Police Interceptor); frame reinforcements in critical locations; and a heavy-duty battery. Beginning in 2006, an engine idle hour meter, similar to that found in the Police Interceptor, was made standard equipment. On the exterior, the chrome trim was deleted in favor of all-black trim, like the Police model.

While not offered for retail sale in North America, the long-wheelbase Crown Victoria was available for fleet sales targeting the taxi and livery markets. From 2002 to 2006, a special-service version was offered for law-enforcement sale (though not as a Police Interceptor) with chrome street-appearance trim from 2002 to 2004. For GCC export (see below), Ford offered long-wheelbase versions of both the Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis for retail sale.

==== Short Wheelbase (Fleet) ====

A short-wheelbase fleet model, with many of the same features as the long-wheelbase version, was available for sale beginning in 2002. Like its long wheelbase counterpart, it was not available for retail sale.

=== End of Retail Sales and Transition to Fleet Sales (2008–2011) ===
In 2006, after factoring out fleet/Police Interceptor sales (95% of production), retail sales of the Crown Victoria dwindled to 3,000 (coming within 1,100 units of the Ford GT super-car), outsold by its Mercury Grand Marquis counterpart by an 18-to-1 margin. For 2008, Ford ended retail sales of the Crown Victoria in the United States, removing the model from its website (later replacing it with the newly revived 2008 Ford Taurus). Ford Fleet sales continued the marketing of the Police Interceptor and commercial (taxi/fleet/LWB) variants. Subsequently, the only retail market selling the Ford Crown Victoria was the GCC/Middle East, with the Crown Victoria sold alongside the Mercury Grand Marquis.

For 2009, the Crown Victoria model line underwent a consolidation, as the LX became the sole version of the standard-wheelbase Crown Victoria (alongside the standard Fleet model and Police Interceptor).

For 2010, the Crown Victoria saw changes to its long-running VIN designation for each trim:

=== Export ===

==== Canada ====
Ford of Canada (the official manufacturer of the Crown Victoria, Police Interceptor, and Mercury Grand Marquis) marketed the Ford Crown Victoria in Canada through the 1999 model year. For the 2000 model year, the Crown Victoria was replaced in retail markets by the Mercury Grand Marquis (sold at Ford dealerships); the Crown Victoria was restricted to fleet sales (consisting largely of the Police Interceptor).

After the 2011 model year, Ford of Canada ended sales of the Grand Marquis, Crown Victoria, and Crown Victoria Police Interceptor; their lack of stability control precluded further official sales in Canada. All three model lines were replaced by the sixth-generation Ford Taurus.

==== Middle East (GCC) ====

Through its production, the Ford Crown Victoria was exported to the Gulf Cooperation Council nations alongside its Lincoln-Mercury counterparts. In a region favoring full-size sedans (among other vehicles), the Crown Victoria became popular, as buyers of the region favored its durability, reliability, and ease of use (in comparison to German and British luxury vehicles), along with its lower price. As American nameplates shifted to newer vehicles (with the introduction of the Chrysler 300C, Dodge Charger, and the Chevrolet Caprice becoming a variant of the Holden Caprice), during the 2000s, the Crown Victoria, Grand Marquis, and Lincoln Town Car, while still popular, began to lose market share, primarily due to their age.

Panther-chassis sedans destined for Middle East export were referred to as &quot;GCC-Spec&quot; vehicles. Five versions of the Crown Victoria were available: Standard, Sport, Long-wheelbase, LX, and LX Sport. Unlike the United States and Canada, the long-wheelbase Crown Victoria was available for retail sale. In Kuwait, where the Crown Victoria was outsold by the higher-trim Mercury Grand Marquis, only the Standard and Long-wheelbase versions were sold after 2000 (the LX was discontinued in 1999).

===== Modifications from North American vehicles=====

Along with a metric instrument panel, several modifications are made to the GCC-Spec Crown Victoria. In place of the 50/50 bench seat of the standard Crown Victoria, GCC-Spec vehicles use a 40/20/40 bench seat. Derived from the Lincoln Town Car, the front console assembly has air conditioning vents for the rear seats (except for LX Sport models), an eight-way driver&#x27;s seat, a four-way manual passenger seat (an eight-way power seat as an option); seat upholstery is either cloth or leather. On all standard-wheelbase models, a true dual-exhaust system was fitted (not available on a U.S. Crown Victoria). On Standard and Standard Long-Wheelbase models, a driver&#x27;s side spotlight assembly was optional. A DVD entertainment system (marketed as Export DVD Entertainment System) was added for the 2007 model year, it was optional on Sport, LX, and LX Sport models.

Differing from its North American counterpart, the warranty offered for a GCC-spec Crown Victoria was 5 years/200,000 kilometers (125,000 miles) – whichever came first.

Derived from the Mercury Marauder, a trunk-lid spoiler was either standard or an option on all standard-wheelbase models. For GCC-spec vehicles, the optional Handling and Performance Package (HPP) offered in the United States was rebranded the Export Handling Package (EHP). The EHP differed from the HPP largely by its retention of the 2.73:1 rear axle ratio (the base axle) and the use of a true dual exhaust system (standard equipment on all standard-wheelbase export versions). Included as part of the Sport and LX Sport trims (optional on the LX), the package includes a tuned rear air suspension, revised coil springs, handling shock absorbers, and a larger rear stabilizer bar. On GCC-Spec Crown Victorias, the EHP option is externally distinguished by a monochromatic paint scheme, with Ford offering Dark Toreador Red, Silver Birch, Tungsten, and Black as color choices.

===== 2008 Special Edition =====

With no major redesign of the Crown Victoria since 1998, to keep the model line competitive, the GCC importer of Ford vehicles designed a commemorative trim package for the 2008 model year. Exclusive to GCC-Spec Standard models, the cosmetic package added several cosmetic features, including a three-bar grille (in the style of the Ford Fusion), Mercury Marauder trunk lid spoiler (derived from EHP), chrome trim on the front and rear bumpers, &quot;Special Edition&quot; logos on the front fenders, trunk lid, and dashboard, as well as an AM/FM/CD Premium stereo.

All other features of the Special Edition are identical to the Standard-trim model. Not listed in any sales literature, it was available in a choice of three different colors. In Kuwait, the Special Edition was only available in black (due to market size); the price was about KWD 6,000 (roughly US$22,000). For 2009, the Special Edition was withdrawn.

==Discontinuation and legacy==

As part of The Way Forward plan of 2006, the St. Thomas Assembly Plant was switched to a single daily production shift in an effort to reduce operating costs. The plan also detailed that Ford would be closing 14 facilities in North America by 2012. It was estimated that the plan would save the company nearly US$5,000,000,000, as its workforce would be reduced by roughly 30,000 employees. The Lincoln Town Car joined its Ford and Mercury counterparts in production at St. Thomas by 2008; the Wixom Assembly Plant, where it was produced, fell victim to the plan and ceased operations following the 2007 model year.

In 2008, Ford signaled that it would be closing the St. Thomas Assembly Plant in 2010. However, the Canadian Auto Workers Union successfully negotiated an extension to at least 2011. In 2009, Ford officially announced that the St. Thomas Assembly Plant would be closed in 2011, as Ford was hard hit by the 2008–2010 automotive industry crisis; it also affected demand for full size cars, which decreased significantly. Moreover, Ford offered retirement incentives to employees at the plant for up to $90,000, allowances up to $100,000, and vouchers for a new Ford vehicle.

Another reason why the Crown Victoria was discontinued was due to its lack of electronic stability control, which became federally mandated for all new vehicles in the US and Canada for the 2012 model year. As a result, the entire batch of 2012 versions were exported to the Middle East.

In April 2011, Ford stopped taking new orders for the Crown Victoria. In August 2011, a short production run of 2012 models destined for the Middle East commenced. Production of the Crown Victoria officially ended on September 15, 2011, at 12:25 PM EDT, when a white LX model rolled off the assembly line. It became the final Panther platform vehicle produced, the final full-size body-on-frame sedan produced, and the last vehicle to be produced by the St. Thomas Assembly Plant, which was closed immediately following the end of production for the model.

The Crown Victoria was the only Panther platform vehicle produced for the 2012 model year, with the Mercury Grand Marquis ending production on January 4, 2011, and the Lincoln Town Car following in suit on August 29, 2011; both ended production as 2011 models.

Taxi fleets revered the Crown Victoria, particularly in New York City, where it was the primary vehicle of its yellow cab fleet for over a decade. They were noted by operators for their durability, simplicity, and cost effectiveness. In 2007, NYC gathered stakeholders, taxi drivers, passengers, and other representatives to set goals that the next NYC yellow taxi should follow as part of the &quot;Taxi of Tomorrow&quot; program. When Ford announced the end of production for the Crown Victoria in 2009, the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission promptly issued proposal requests to automakers, who submitted their ideas for a purpose-built taxi vehicle to the commission. On May 3, 2011, NYC officially announced that a purpose-built version of the Nissan NV200 minivan would become the successor to its fleet of Crown Victoria yellow cabs, and was selected over the Ford Transit Connect, as well as a minivan built by Turkish auto manufacturer Karsan.

However, the Crown Victoria remains popular in taxi use, as de-commissioned Police versions often end up being purchased and used by privately owned taxi and livery cab companies.

Police fleets also mourned the end of the Crown Victoria, as it became the primary police vehicle for most police fleets in the US following the discontinuation of the B-body Chevrolet Caprice in 1996. Some agencies have been reluctant to retire the last of their Crown Victoria fleet, as the model was the last traditional police vehicle (body-on-frame, full size sedan). Several departments such as the Los Angeles Sheriff Department, Austin, TX Police Department, and the Long Beach, CA Police Department stockpiled the Crown Victoria during its final model year, as they were hesitant to adopt new models. As of December 2023, the Los Angeles Sheriff Department still had over 400 CVPI&#x27;s in service, as they ordered a batch of 600 units immediately before new orders ceased in 2011. According to the department, the CVPI has held up well over the years, and is still a go to choice for tenured deputies working in the department.

For television and film, the Ford Crown Victoria has made more appearances than any other vehicle of all time, with nearly 7,000 appearances in over 70,000 pieces of media and counting. They continue to be a popular choice to depict police cars and taxicabs.

Between 1991 and 2011, the St. Thomas Assembly Plant produced over 1.5 million examples of the Crown Victoria, second only to its Mercury counterpart, which saw more than 1.7 million examples produced by the plant in that timespan.

==Safety concerns and issues==

===Fuel tank===
The reports that the cars were more prone to fires during a rear collision were a simple combination of three things. First, most law-enforcement agencies relied on the Crown Victoria as their primary vehicle, meaning that any police-related auto accident was very likely to involve a Crown Victoria. Second, the accidents occurred as the result of the officers intentionally parking their vehicles close to active traffic to shield a stopped motorist—something most regular drivers would never do. Third, the impacting vehicle was often traveling at, or above, the posted legal limit ( in most jurisdictions).

The condition was exacerbated by police equipment installers drilling over the package tray in the luggage compartment. Due to the gas tank&#x27;s orientation, drilling through the package tray may result in drilling into the gas tank. Installers also used screws set directly into the bulkhead and facing the fuel tank. In the event of a high-energy collision, these screws could be forced into the tank, both rupturing the tank and possibly acting as a spark source. Long bolts for mounting heavier equipment were also suspected. The manufacturer provided an aftermarket shield to help prevent these items from puncturing the tank during impact. Further, many investigations, both performed by federal/state agencies, and the police department themselves, have found that removable items in the trunk were improperly stowed. These items became tank-piercing projectiles during the rear-collision scenarios. Ford&#x27;s second solution came in the form of a recall kit including patterns to mark unsafe areas (to drill) in the luggage compartment. Also included were rubberized Kevlar and hard ballistic nylon shields for the differential cover lower shock bolts. They also included a Kevlar-based trunk liner. Ford used similar kits on early-1980s model passenger vehicles. For 2005 and newer models, Ford offers an optional onboard fire-suppression system for the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor units. The system itself is integrated with the antilock braking system as part of the activation and can be activated manually. However, Ford does cite several system limitations regarding fuel loss and impact speeds.

Despite numerous court cases charging Ford with partial liability for fires caused in accidents, the company has never been found liable in a Crown Victoria accident.

===Steering shaft recall===
In September 2013, Ford issued a recall for 370,000 Ford Crown Victoria, Mercury Grand Marquis, and Lincoln Town Car vehicles built between 2005 and 2011, due to the possibility of steering shaft corrosion. According to Ford, the corrosion could cause loss of steering, potentially leading to a crash. Vehicles sold in the following states were covered by the recall: Connecticut, Delaware, D.C., Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin, and West Virginia. 15,000 of the affected vehicles were also sold in Canada. Ford recommended that dealers inspect the vehicles and replace the steering intermediate shaft, lower steering column bearing, and upper intermediate shaft, if necessary.

===Light Control Module (LCM)===
On April 14, 2017, Ford issued a recall for approximately 313,000 2003-05 Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis models due to an issue with the Light Control Module, which could result in a loss of the headlamp function. According to Ford, the solder joints on the module could crack and interrupt power to the headlamps. The dealer will inspect and replace the module, free of charge.

===Rear Axle===
Certain 2003 model vehicles produced before January 2003 could develop issues with the rear axle. The axle may not have been properly heat treated from the factory, leading to premature wear. The issue mostly affected fleet and police models. Dealers sometimes treated this as a silent recall for non-fleet vehicles.

===Intake Manifold===
Model years from 1996 through 2001 using an all-composite intake manifold manufactured by DuPont were subject to coolant leaks. Cracks would develop along the thermostat housing area, causing antifreeze leaks and overheating issues. Misfires have also been reported, as leaking anti-freeze may seep down into the spark plug wells. For 2002, a revised intake manifold with a bolt-on aluminum thermostat housing and anti-freeze crossover was produced and fitted to all new vehicles in an attempt to remedy the issue. The new intake was more reliable, however, these intake manifolds also proved to be problematic. Another common failure point on the intake is the rear heater hose fitting, located in front of the passenger-side firewall. The fitting used an integral plastic nipple to connect the heater return hose to the heater core. This fitting has been known to break off from the intake manifold, causing rapid antifreeze loss. Late in 2005, Ford settled a class-action lawsuit regarding the intake manifold.

<doc id="286369" wikidata="Q193484" url="?curid=286369" title="Assassination of John F. Kennedy">
<text>John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States, was assassinated while riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. Kennedy was in the vehicle with his wife Jacqueline, Texas governor John Connally, and Connally&#x27;s wife Nellie, when he was fatally shot from the nearby Texas School Book Depository by Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine. The motorcade rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where Kennedy was pronounced dead about 30 minutes after the shooting; Connally was also wounded in the attack but recovered. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was hastily sworn in as president two hours and eight minutes later aboard Air Force One at Dallas Love Field.

After the assassination, Oswald returned home to retrieve a pistol; he shot and killed lone Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit shortly afterwards. Around 70 minutes after Kennedy and Connally were shot, Oswald was apprehended by the Dallas Police Department and charged under Texas state law with the murders of Kennedy and Tippit. Two days later, at 11:21 a.m. on November 24, 1963, as live television cameras covered Oswald&#x27;s being moved through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters, he was fatally shot by Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby. Like Kennedy, Oswald was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where he soon died. Ruby was convicted of Oswald&#x27;s murder, though the decision was overturned on appeal, and Ruby died in prison in 1967 while awaiting a new trial.

After a 10-month investigation, the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, and that there was no evidence that either Oswald or Ruby was part of a conspiracy. In 1967, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison brought the only trial for Kennedy&#x27;s murder, against businessman Clay Shaw; Shaw was acquitted. Subsequent federal investigations—such as the Rockefeller Commission and Church Committee—agreed with the Warren Commission&#x27;s general findings. In its 1979 report, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that Kennedy was likely &quot;assassinated as a result of a conspiracy&quot;. The HSCA did not identify possible conspirators, but concluded that there was &quot;a high probability that two gunmen fired at [the] President&quot;. The HSCA&#x27;s conclusions were largely based on a police Dictabelt recording later debunked by the U.S. Justice Department.

Kennedy&#x27;s assassination is still the subject of widespread debate and has spawned many conspiracy theories and alternative scenarios; polls found that a vast majority of Americans believed there was a conspiracy. The assassination left a profound impact and was the first of four major assassinations during the 1960s in the United States, coming two years before the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, and five years before the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Kennedy&#x27;s brother Robert in 1968. Executive Order 14176, signed by President Donald Trump in January 2025, aimed to declassify records about the assassination. Kennedy was the fourth U.S. president to be assassinated and is the most recent to have died in office.

==Background==
===Kennedy===
In 1960, John F. Kennedy, then a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, was elected the 35th president of the United States with Lyndon B. Johnson as his vice presidential running mate. Kennedy&#x27;s tenure saw the height of the Cold War, and much of his foreign policy was dedicated to countering the Soviet Union and communism. As president, he authorized operations to overthrow Fidel Castro&#x27;s communist government in Cuba, which culminated in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961, during which he declined to directly involve American troops. The following year, Kennedy deescalated the Cuban Missile Crisis, an incident widely regarded as the closest that humanity has come to nuclear holocaust.

In 1963, Kennedy decided to travel to Texas to smooth over frictions in the state&#x27;s Democratic Party between liberal U.S. senator Ralph Yarborough and conservative governor John Connally. The visit was first agreed upon by Kennedy, Johnson, and Connally during a meeting in El Paso in June. The motorcade route was finalized on November 18 and announced soon thereafter. Kennedy also viewed the Texas trip as an informal launch of his 1964 reelection campaign.

===Oswald===

Lee Harvey Oswald (born 1939) was a former U.S. Marine who had served in Japan and the Philippines and had espoused communist beliefs since reading Karl Marx aged 14. After accidentally shooting his elbow with an unauthorized handgun and fighting an officer, Oswald was court-martialed twice and demoted. In September 1959, he received a dependency discharge after claiming his mother was disabled. A 19-year-old Oswald sailed on a freighter from New Orleans to France and then traveled to Finland, where he was issued a Soviet visa.

Oswald defected to the Soviet Union, and in January 1960 he was sent to work at a factory in Minsk, Belarus. In 1961, he met and married Marina Prusakova, with whom he had a child. In 1962, he returned to the United States with a repatriation loan from the U.S. Embassy. He settled in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, where he socialized with Russian émigrés—notably George de Mohrenschildt. In March 1963, a bullet narrowly missed General Edwin Walker at his Dallas residence; a witness observed two conspicuous men. Relying on Marina&#x27;s testimony, a note left by Oswald, and ballistic evidence, the Warren Commission attributed this assassination attempt to Oswald.

In April 1963, Oswald returned to his birthplace, New Orleans, and established an independent chapter of the pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee, of which he was the sole member. While passing out pro-Castro literature alongside unknown compatriots, Oswald was arrested after scuffling with anti-Castro Cuban exiles. In late September 1963, Oswald traveled to Mexico City, where, according to the Warren Commission, he visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies. 
On October 3, Oswald returned to Dallas and found work at the Texas School Book Depository on Dealey Plaza. During the workweek he lived separately from Marina at a Dallas rooming house. On the morning of the assassination, he carried a long package (which he told coworkers contained curtain rods) into the Depository; the Warren Commission concluded that this package contained Oswald&#x27;s disassembled rifle.

==November 22==
===Kennedy&#x27;s arrival in Dallas and route to Dealey Plaza===
On November 22, Air Force One arrived at Dallas Love Field at 11:40 a.m. President Kennedy and the First Lady boarded a 1961 Lincoln Continental convertible limousine to travel to a luncheon at the Dallas Trade Mart. Other occupants of this vehiclethe second in the motorcade—were Secret Service Agent Bill Greer, who drove; Special Agent Roy Kellerman in the front passenger seat; and Governor Connally and his wife Nellie, who sat just forward of the Kennedys. Four Dallas police motorcycle officers accompanied the Kennedy limousine. Vice President Johnson, his wife Lady Bird, and Senator Yarborough rode in another convertible.

The motorcade&#x27;s meandering route through Dallas was designed to give Kennedy maximum exposure to crowds by passing through a suburban section of Dallas, and Main Street in Downtown Dallas, before turning right on Houston Street. After another block, the motorcade was to turn left onto Elm Street, pass through Dealey Plaza, and travel a short segment of the Stemmons Freeway to the Trade Mart. The planned route had been reported in newspapers several days in advance. Despite concerns about hostile protestorsKennedy&#x27;s UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson had been spat on in Dallas a month earlierKennedy was greeted warmly by enthusiastic crowds.
===Shooting===

Kennedy&#x27;s limousine entered Dealey Plaza at 12:30 p.m. CST. Nellie Connally turned and commented to Kennedy, who was sitting behind her, &quot;Mr. President, they can&#x27;t make you believe now that there are not some in Dallas who love and appreciate you, can they?&quot; Kennedy&#x27;s reply&quot;No, they sure can&#x27;t&quot;were his last words.

From Houston Street, the limousine made the planned left turn onto Elm, passing the Texas School Book Depository. As it continued down Elm Street, multiple shots were fired: about 80% of the witnesses recalled hearing three shots. The Warren Commission concluded that three shots were fired and noted that most witnesses recalled that the second and third shots were bunched together. Shortly after Kennedy began waving, some witnesses heard the first gunshot, but few in the crowd or motorcade reacted, many interpreting the sound as a firecracker or backfire.
Within one second of each other, Governor Connally and Mrs. Kennedy turned abruptly from their left to their right. Connally—an experienced hunter—immediately recognized the sound as that of a rifle and turned his head and torso rightward, noting nothing unusual behind him. He testified that he could not see Kennedy, so he started to turn forward again (turning from his right to his left), and that when his head was facing about 20 degrees left of center, he was struck in his upper right back by a shot he did not hear, then shouted, &quot;My God. They&#x27;re going to kill us all!&quot;

According to the Warren Commission and the HSCA, Kennedy was waving to the crowds on his right when a shot entered his upper back and exited his throat just beneath his larynx. He raised his elbows and clenched his fists in front of his face and neck, then leaned forward and leftward. Mrs. Kennedy, facing him, put her arms around him. Although a serious wound, it likely would have been survivable.

According to the Warren Commission&#x27;s single-bullet theory—derided as the &quot;magic bullet theory&quot; by conspiracy theorists—Governor Connally was injured by the same bullet that exited Kennedy&#x27;s neck. The bullet created an oval-shaped entry wound near Connally&#x27;s shoulder, struck and destroyed several inches of his right fifth rib, and exited his chest just below his right nipple, puncturing and collapsing his lung. That same bullet then entered his arm just above his right wrist and shattered his right radius bone. The bullet exited just below the wrist at the inner side of his right palm and finally lodged in his left thigh.

As the limousine passed the grassy knoll, Kennedy was struck a second time, by a fatal shot to the head. The Warren Commission made no finding as to whether this was the second or third bullet fired, and concluded—as did the HSCA—that the second shot to strike Kennedy entered the rear of his head. It then passed in fragments through his skull, creating a large, &quot;roughly &quot; hole on the rear, right side of the head, and spraying blood and fragments. His brain and blood spatter landed as far as the following Secret Service car and the motorcycle officers.

Secret Service Agent Clint Hill was riding on the running board of the car immediately behind Kennedy&#x27;s limousine. Hill testified to the Warren Commission that he heard one shot, jumped onto the street, and ran forward to board the limousine and protect Kennedy. Hill stated that he heard the fatal headshot as he reached the Lincoln, &quot;approximately five seconds&quot; after the first shot that he heard. After the headshot, Mrs. Kennedy began climbing onto the limousine&#x27;s trunk, but she later had no recollection of doing so. Hill believed she may have been reaching for a piece of Kennedy&#x27;s skull. He jumped onto the limousine&#x27;s bumper, and he clung to the car as it exited Dealey Plaza and sped to Parkland Memorial Hospital. After Mrs. Kennedy crawled back into her seat, both Governor and Mrs. Connally heard her repeatedly saying: &quot;They have killed my husband. I have his brains in my hand.&quot;

Bystander James Tague received a minor wound to the cheek—either from bullet or concrete curb fragments—while standing by the triple underpass. Nine months later, the FBI removed the curb, and spectrographic analysis revealed metallic residue consistent with the lead core in Oswald&#x27;s ammunition. Tague testified before the Warren Commission and initially stated that he was wounded by either the second or third shot of the three shots that he remembered hearing. When the commission counsel pressed him to be more specific, Tague testified that he was wounded by the second shot.

===Aftermath in Dealey Plaza===
As the motorcade left Dealey Plaza, some witnesses sought cover, and others joined police officers to run up the grassy knoll in search of a shooter. No shooter was found behind the knoll&#x27;s picket fence. Among the 178 witnesses who testified to the Warren Commission, 78 were unsure of the shots&#x27; origin, 49 believed they came from the Depository, and 21 thought they came from the grassy knoll. No witness ever reported seeing anyone—with or without a gun—immediately behind the knoll&#x27;s picket fence at the time of the shooting.

Lee Bowers was in a two-story railroad switch tower behind the grassy knoll&#x27;s picket fence; he was watching the motorcade and had an unobstructed view of the only route by which a shooter could flee the grassy knoll; he saw no one leaving the scene. Bowers testified to the Warren Commission that &quot;one or two&quot; men were between him and the fence during the assassination: one was a familiar parking lot attendant and the other wore a uniform like a county courthouse custodian. He testified seeing &quot;some commotion&quot; on the grassy knoll at the time of the assassination: &quot;something out of the ordinary, a sort of milling around, but something occurred in this particular spot which was out of the ordinary, which attracted my eye for some reason which I could not identify&quot;.

At 12:36 p.m., teenager Amos Euins approached Dallas police Sergeant D.V. Harkness to report having seen a &quot;colored man ... leaning out of the window [with] a rifle&quot; on the sixth floor of the Depository during the assassination; in response, Harkness radioed that he was sealing off the Depository. Witness Howard Brennan then approached a police inspector to report seeing a shooter—a white man in khaki clothing—in the same window. Police broadcast Brennan&#x27;s description of the man at 12:45 p.m. Brennan testified that, after the second shot, &quot;This man... was aiming for his last shot ... and maybe paused for another second as though to assure himself that he had hit his mark.&quot; Witness James R. Worrell Jr. also reported seeing a gun barrel emerge from a sixth floor Depository window. Bonnie Ray Williams, who was on the fifth floor of the Depository, stated that the rifle&#x27;s report was so loud and near that ceiling plaster fell onto his head.

===Oswald&#x27;s flight, killing of J. D. Tippit, and arrest===

When searching the sixth floor of the Depository, two deputies found an Italian Carcano M91/38 bolt-action rifle. Oswald had purchased the used rifle the previous March under the alias &quot;A. Hidell&quot; and had it delivered to his Dallas P.O. box. The FBI found Oswald&#x27;s partial palm print on the barrel, and fibers on the rifle were consistent with those of Oswald&#x27;s shirt. A bullet found on Governor Connally&#x27;s hospital gurney and two fragments found in the limousine were ballistically matched to the Carcano.

Oswald left the Depository and traveled by bus to his boarding house, where he retrieved a jacket and revolver. At 1:12 p.m., police officer J. D. Tippit spotted Oswald walking in the residential neighborhood of Oak Cliff and called him to his patrol car. After an exchange of words, Tippit exited his vehicle; Oswald then shot Tippit three times in the chest. As Tippit lay on the ground, Oswald fired a final shot into Tippit&#x27;s right temple. Oswald then calmly walked away before running as witnesses emerged.

As Dallas police officers conducted a roll call of Depository employees, Oswald&#x27;s supervisor Roy Truly realized that Oswald was absent and notified the police. Based on a false identification of Oswald, Dallas police raided a library in Oak Cliff before realizing their mistake. At 1:36 p.m., the police were called after a conspicuous Oswald, tired from running, was seen sneaking into the Texas Theatre without paying. With the film &quot;War Is Hell&quot; still playing, Dallas policemen arrested Oswald after a brief struggle in which Oswald drew his fully loaded gun. He denied shooting anyone and claimed he was being made a &quot;&quot; because he had lived in the Soviet Union.

===Kennedy declared dead; Johnson sworn in===
At 12:38 p.m., Kennedy arrived in the emergency room of Parkland Memorial Hospital. Although Kennedy was still breathing after the shooting, his personal physician, George Burkley, immediately saw that survival was impossible. After Parkland surgeons performed futile cardiac massage, Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1:00 p.m., 30 minutes after the shooting. CBS host Walter Cronkite broke the news on live television.

The Secret Service was concerned about the possibility of a larger plot and urged Johnson to leave Dallas and return to the White House, but Johnson refused to do so without any proof of Kennedy&#x27;s death. Johnson returned to Air Force One around 1:30p.m., and shortly thereafter, he received telephone calls from advisors McGeorge Bundy and Walter Jenkins advising him to depart for Washington, D.C., immediately. He replied that he would not leave Dallas without Jacqueline Kennedy and that she would not leave without Kennedy&#x27;s body. According to &quot;Esquire&quot;, Johnson did &quot;not want to be remembered as an abandoner of beautiful widows&quot;.

At the time of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, the murder of a president was not under federal jurisdiction. Accordingly, Dallas County medical examiner Earl Rose insisted that Texas law required him to perform an autopsy. A heated exchange between Kennedy&#x27;s aides and Dallas officials nearly erupted into a fistfight before the Texans yielded and allowed Kennedy&#x27;s body to be transported to Air Force One. At 2:38 p.m., with Jacqueline Kennedy at his side, Johnson was administered the oath of office by federal judge Sarah Tilghman Hughes aboard Air Force One, shortly before departing for Washington with Kennedy&#x27;s coffin.

==Immediate aftermath==
===Autopsy===
President Kennedy&#x27;s autopsy was performed at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland on the night of November 22. Jacqueline Kennedy had selected a naval hospital as the postmortem site as President Kennedy had been a naval officer during World War II. The autopsy was conducted by three physicians: naval commanders James Humes and J. Thornton Boswell, with assistance from ballistics wound expert Pierre A. Finck; Humes led the procedure. Under pressure from the Kennedy family and White House staffers to expedite the procedure, the physicians conducted a &quot;rushed&quot; and incomplete autopsy. Kennedy&#x27;s personal physician, Rear Admiral George Burkley, signed a death certificate on November 23 and recorded that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the skull.

Three years after the autopsy, Kennedy&#x27;s brain—which had been removed and preserved for later analysis—was found to be missing when the Kennedy family transferred material to the National Archives. Conspiracy theorists often claim that the brain may have shown that the headshot entered from the front. Alternatively, the HSCA concluded that an assistant to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, the president&#x27;s brother, likely removed the footlocker holding the brain and other materials at his direction, and he &quot;either destroyed these materials or otherwise rendered them inaccessible&quot; to prevent &quot;misuse&quot; of said material or to hide the extent of the president&#x27;s chronic illnesses and consequent medication. Some autopsy X-rays and photographs have also been lost.

Most historians regard the autopsy as the &quot;most botched&quot; segment of the government&#x27;s investigation. The HSCA forensic pathology panel concluded that the autopsy had &quot;extensive failings&quot;, including failure to take sufficient photographs, failure to determine the exact exit or entry point of the head bullet, not dissecting the back and neck, and neglecting to determine the angles of gunshot injuries relative to body axis. The panel further concluded that the two doctors were not qualified to have conducted a forensic autopsy. Panel member Milton Helpern—Chief Medical Examiner for New York City—said that selecting Humes (who had only taken a single course on forensic pathology) to lead the autopsy was &quot;like sending a seven-year-old boy who has taken three lessons on the violin over to the New York Philharmonic and expecting him to perform a Tchaikovsky symphony&quot;.

===Funeral===

Following the autopsy, Kennedy lay in repose in the East Room of the White House for 24 hours. President Johnson issued , declaring November 25 to be a national day of mourning, and that only essential emergency workers be at their posts. The coffin was then carried on a horse-drawn caisson to the Capitol to lie in state. Hundreds of thousands of mourners lined up to view the guarded casket, with a quarter million passing through the rotunda during the 18 hours of lying in state. Even in the Soviet Union—according to a memo by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover—news of the assassination &quot;was greeted by great shock and consternation and church bells were tolled in the memory of President Kennedy&quot;.

Kennedy&#x27;s funeral service was held on November 25, at St. Matthew&#x27;s Cathedral, with the Requiem Mass led by Cardinal Richard Cushing. About 1,200 guests, including representatives from over 90 countries, attended. Although there was no formal eulogy, Auxiliary Bishop Philip M. Hannan read excerpts from Kennedy&#x27;s speeches and writings. After the service, Kennedy was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. An eternal flame was lit at his burial site in 1967.

===Killing of Oswald===

On Sunday, November 24, at 11:21 a.m., as Oswald was being escorted to a car in the basement of Dallas Police headquarters for the transfer from the city jail to the county jail, he was shot by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby. The shooting was broadcast live on television. Robert H. Jackson of the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot; photographed the shooting which was titled, Jack Ruby Shoots Lee Harvey Oswald for which he was awarded the 1964 Pulitzer Prize for Photography.

Drifting in and out of consciousness, Oswald was taken by ambulance to Parkland Memorial Hospital; he was treated by the same surgeons who had tried to save Kennedy. The bullet had entered his lower left chest but had not exited; major heart blood vessels such as the aorta and inferior vena cava were severed, and the spleen, kidney, and liver were hit. Despite surgical intervention and defibrillation, Oswald died at 1:07 p.m.

Arrested immediately after the shooting, Ruby testified to the Warren Commission that he had been distraught by Kennedy&#x27;s death and that killing Oswald would spare &quot;Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial&quot;. He also stated he shot Oswald on the spur of the moment when the opportunity presented itself, without considering any reason for doing so. Initially, Ruby wished to represent himself in his trial until his lawyer Melvin Belli dissuaded him: Belli argued that Ruby had an episode of psychomotor epilepsy and was thus not responsible. Ruby was convicted, but the decision was overturned on appeal. While awaiting retrial in 1967, Ruby died of a pulmonary embolism, secondary to cancer. Like Oswald and Kennedy, Ruby was declared dead at Parkland Hospital.

==Films and photographs of the assassination==

Standing on the pergola wall some from the road, tailor Abraham Zapruder recorded Kennedy&#x27;s killing on 26 seconds of silent 8 mm film — known as the Zapruder film. Frame 313 captures the exact moment at which Kennedy&#x27;s head explodes. &quot;Life&quot; magazine published frame enlargements from the Zapruder film shortly after the assassination. The footage itself was first publicly shown at the 1969 trial of Clay Shaw, and on television in 1975 by Geraldo Rivera. In 1999, an arbitration panel ordered the federal government to pay $615,384 per second of film to Zapruder&#x27;s heirs, valuing the complete film at $16 million (equivalent to $ in 2022).

Zapruder was one of at least 32 people in Dealey Plaza known to have made film or still photographs at or around the time of the shooting. Most notably among the photographers, Mary Moorman took several photos of Kennedy with her Polaroid, including one of Kennedy less than one-sixth of a second after the headshot.

In addition to Zapruder, Charles Bronson, Marie Muchmore, and Orville Nix filmed the assassination, but at farther distances than Zapruder. Of the three, only Nix — who filmed the assassination from the opposite side of Elm Street from Zapruder, capturing the grassy knoll — actually recorded the fatal shot. In 1966, Nix claimed that, after he gave the film to the FBI, the duplicate that they returned had frames &quot;missing&quot; or &quot;ruined&quot;. Although lower-quality duplicates exist, the original film has been missing since 1978. Previously unknown footage filmed by George Jefferies was released in 2007. Recorded a few blocks before the shooting, the film captures Kennedy&#x27;s bunched suit jacket, explaining the discrepancies between the location of the bullet hole in Kennedy&#x27;s back and his jacket.

Some films and photographs captured an unidentified woman apparently filming the assassination; researchers have nicknamed her the Babushka Lady due to the shawl around her head. In 1978, Gordon Arnold came forward and claimed that he had filmed the assassination from the grassy knoll and that a police officer had confiscated his film. Arnold is not visible in any photographs taken of the area, which Vincent Bugliosi—author of &quot;Reclaiming History&quot;—called &quot;conclusive photographic proof that Arnold&#x27;s story was fabricated&quot;.

==Official investigations==

===Dallas Police===

At the Dallas Police headquarters, officers interrogated Oswald about the shootings of Kennedy and Tippit; these intermittent interviews lasted for approximately 12 hours between 2:30 p.m. on November 22 and 11 a.m. on November 24. Throughout, Oswald denied any involvement and resorted to statements that were found to be false.

Captain J. W. Fritz of the Homicide and Robbery Bureau did most of the questioning and kept only rudimentary notes. Days later, Fritz wrote a report of the interrogation from notes he made afterwards. There were no stenographic or tape recordings. Representatives of other law enforcement agencies were also present, including the FBI and the Secret Service, and occasionally participated in the questioning. Several of the FBI agents who were present wrote contemporaneous reports of the interrogation.

On the evening of November 22, Dallas Police performed paraffin tests on Oswald&#x27;s hands and right cheek in an effort to establish whether or not he had recently fired a weapon. The results were positive for the hands and negative for the right cheek. Such tests were unreliable, and the Warren Commission did not rely on these results.

The Dallas police forced Oswald to host a press conference after midnight on November 23, and, early in the investigation, made many leaks to the media. Their conduct angered Johnson, who instructed the FBI to tell them to &quot;stop talking about the assassination&quot;. Dallas Police, after the FBI expressed concerns that someone might try to kill Oswald, assured federal authorities that they would provide him adequate protection.

===FBI investigation===
The FBI immediately launched an investigation into the assassination, relying on a federal statute that forbade assaulting a federal officer. Within 24 hours of the killing, FBI Director Hoover sent President Johnson a preliminary report finding that Oswald was the sole culprit. After Ruby killed Oswald, Johnson decided that the Texan authorities were incompetent and instructed the FBI to conduct a complete investigation.

On December 9, 1963, the Warren Commission received the FBI&#x27;s report of its investigation which concluded that three bullets had been firedthe first striking Kennedy in the upper back; the second striking Connally; and the third striking Kennedy in the head, killing him. The FBI continued to serve as the main investigative arm of the Warren Commission in the field. A total of 169 FBI agents worked on the case, conducting over 25,000 interviews and writing over 2,300 reports.

The thoroughness of the FBI&#x27;s investigation is contested. Bugliosi applauded its quality and cites conspiracy theorist Harrison Edward Livingstone&#x27;s praise of the FBI&#x27;s commitment to following all leads. In its 1979 report, the HSCA found that the FBI&#x27;s investigation of pro- and anti-Castro Cubans, and any connections to Oswald or Ruby, was insufficient. The HSCA also noted that Hoover &quot;seemed determined [to make the case that Oswald was the lone assassin] within 24 hours of the assassination&quot;.

===Warren Commission===
On November 29, President Johnson established by executive order &quot;The President&#x27;s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy&quot; and selected Chief Justice Earl Warren of the U.S. Supreme Court to chair the investigation, commonly known as the Warren Commission. Its 888-page final report was presented to Johnson on September 24, 1964, and made public three days later. It concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone in killing Kennedy and wounding Connally, and that Jack Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald. It made no conclusions as to Oswald&#x27;s motive, but noted his Marxism, anti-authoritarianism, violent tendencies, failure to form personal relationships, and his desire to be significant in history.

Upon examining the Zapruder film, commission staffers realized that the FBI&#x27;s gunshot theory was impossible. The reaction times of Kennedy and Connally were too close to have been caused by two bullets from Oswald: the reaction interval was less than the 2.3 seconds that it took to reload. This was one of the commission&#x27;s most crucial findings: that a single shot caused the non-fatal wounds of Kennedy and Connally, known as the &quot;single-bullet theory&quot;. In May 1964, staffer Arlen Specter replicated the single bullet&#x27;s trajectory via a reenactment in Dealey Plaza: the bullet&#x27;s path was exactly consistent with Kennedy&#x27;s and Connally&#x27;s wounds.

Out of the eight commission members, three—Representative Hale Boggs and Senators John Cooper and Richard Russell—found the theory &quot;improbable&quot;; their qualms were not mentioned in the final report. Conspiracy theorists labelled this theory the &quot;magic bullet theory&quot;, partly due to the bullet&#x27;s intact and purportedly pristine state. However, the HSCA&#x27;s Michael Baden noted that the bullet, despite its lack of fragmentation, was fundamentally deformed. In 2023, Secret Service Agent Paul Landis—who had stood on the running board of Kennedy&#x27;s car—told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he retrieved the &quot;magic bullet&quot; from immediately behind Kennedy&#x27;s seat upon arrival at Parkland, and that he placed it on Kennedy&#x27;s stretcher. Landis believes that the bullet dislodged from a shallow wound in Kennedy&#x27;s back.

As well as the Warren Report&#x27;s 27 published volumes, the commission created hundreds of thousands of pages of investigative reports and documents. Relman Morin stated that &quot;Never in history was a crime probed as intensely&quot;; Bugliosi concluded that the commission&#x27;s basic findings have &quot;held up remarkably well&quot;. According to Gerald Posner, the Warren report is &quot;universally derided&quot; by the American public. Walter Cronkite noted that, &quot;Although the Warren Commission had full power to conduct its own independent investigation, it permitted the FBI and the CIA to investigate themselves – and so cast a permanent shadow on the answers.&quot; According to a 2014 report by CIA Chief Historian David Robarge, then-CIA director John A. McCone was involved in a &quot;benign cover-up&quot; by withholding information from the commission.

===Trial of Clay Shaw===

On March 22, 1967, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison arrested and charged New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw with conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy, with the help of Oswald, David Ferrie, and others. A respected businessman who had helped renovate and preserve the French Quarter, Shaw was described as &quot;the unlikeliest villain since Oscar Wilde&quot;. Both Shaw and the neurotic, avidly anti-Castro Ferrie were members of New Orleans&#x27; gay community. Ferrie died, possibly by suicide, four days after news of the investigation broke. On &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in 1968, Garrison first publicly alleged that Shaw and Ferrie had been part of a larger CIA scheme to kill Kennedy and frame Oswald. In the 34-day trial conducted in 1969, Garrison played the Zapruder film and argued that the backwards motion of Kennedy&#x27;s head after the fatal shot was indicative of a shooter in front on the grassy knoll.

After a brief deliberation, the jury found Shaw not guilty. Mark Lane interviewed the jurors after the trial and stated that some believed that Shaw likely was involved in a conspiracy but that there was insufficient evidence to convict. Lane&#x27;s claims have been disputed by playwright James Kirkwood—a personal friend of Clay Shaw—who said that he met several jurors who denied ever speaking to Lane. Kirkwood also questioned Lane&#x27;s claim that the jury believed that there was a conspiracy: jury foreman Sidney Hebert told Kirkwood, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think too much of the Warren Report either until the trial. Now I think a lot more of it than I did before.&quot;

According to academic E. Jerald Ogg, the Shaw trial is now widely regarded as a &quot;travesty of justice&quot;; Kirkwood likened the trial to a Spanish Inquisition hearing. Other observers have characterized the proceedings as relying on homophobia. It remains the only trial to be brought for the Kennedy assassination. In 1979, former CIA director Richard Helms testified that Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contact Service of the CIA, through which Shaw volunteered information from his travels abroad, mostly to Latin America. However, according to Max Holland, some 150,000 Americans were contacts. In 1993, the PBS program &quot;Frontline&quot; obtained a group photograph that featured Ferrie and Oswald together at a 1955 cookout for the Civil Air Patrol: Ferrie had denied ever knowing Oswald.

===Ramsey Clark Panel===

Excluding Chief Justice Warren, the members of Warren Commission did not view the photographs or X-rays taken during Kennedy&#x27;s autopsy. According to Warren, this was to avoid having to publicly release the explicit material to &quot;sensation mongers&quot;. Due to persistent speculation, in February 1968, Attorney General Ramsey Clark convened a panel of four medical experts to examine the photographs and X-rays from the Kennedy autopsy. Their findings concurred with the Warren Commission: Kennedy was struck by two bullets, both from behind.

===Rockefeller Commission===

In 1975, President Gerald Ford—who had been a member of the Warren Commission a decade prior—established the United States President&#x27;s Commission on CIA Activities within the United States, better known as the Rockefeller Commission after its chairman, Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. The commission received a mandate to determine if any domestic activities by the CIA were unlawful and to make appropriate recommendations: accordingly, it also re-examined the Kennedy assassination.

After five months of investigation, the Rockefeller Commission submitted its report to President Ford. The report reviewed the medical evidence and agreed that Kennedy had been killed by two shots from behind. Refuting Garrison&#x27;s claims that the backwards motion of Kennedy&#x27;s head seen on the Zapruder film was indicative of a grassy knoll shooter, the commission found that &quot;such a motion would be caused by a violent straightening and stiffening of the entire body as a result of a seizure-like neuromuscular reaction to major damage inflicted to nerve centers in the brain&quot;. The later HSCA suggested that the &quot;propulsive effect resulting from brain matter&quot; ejected from the exit wound may have been responsible. Pathologist Vincent Di Maio testified before the HSCA that the notion of a &quot;transfer of momentum&quot; from a grassy knoll bullet was unfounded and something from &quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger pictures&quot;.

The Rockefeller Commission also sought to determine whether CIA operatives—particularly E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis—were present in Dealey Plaza during the assassination, and whether they were among the &quot;three tramps&quot; pictured shortly after the assassination. The commission found no evidence for these claims. It also inquired into purported connections between the CIA and Oswald and Ruby, for which it found no evidence and concluded was &quot;farfetched speculation&quot;. They concluded that there was &quot;no credible evidence of CIA involvement&quot;.
===Church Committee===
In 1975, following the Watergate scandal and the revelation of CIA misconduct by Seymour Hersh (the CIA&#x27;s so-called &quot;Family Jewels&quot;), the U.S. Senate launched the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities—better known as the Church Committee after its chairman, Senator Frank Church. The committee was to investigate all improper and unlawful actions by the CIA and FBI, both foreign and domestic. Due to persisting theories, the Church Committee organized a subcommittee (staffed by Senators Richard Schweiker and Gary Hart) to examine CIA and FBI conduct pertaining to the assassination.

In its final report, the Church Committee concluded that there was no evidence of a CIA- or FBI-led conspiracy. They found that the original investigation into the assassination was &quot;deficient&quot; and criticized the FBI and CIA for withholding information from the Warren Commission. In particular, it noted that knowledge of the CIA&#x27;s many failed attempts to assassinate Castro may have significantly affected the course of the investigation. Moreover, the Church Committee revealed that the CIA had conspired with the Mafia in these plots against Castro. These revelations led to further public scrutiny of the assassination.

===United States House Select Committee on Assassinations===

As a result of increasing public and congressional skepticism of the Warren Commission&#x27;s findings and the transparency of government agencies, in 1976 the House Select Committee on Assassinations was created to investigate the assassinations of Kennedy and of Martin Luther King, Jr.

The HSCA conducted its inquiry until 1978 and issued its final report the following year, concluding that Kennedy was likely assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. They concluded that there was a &quot;high probability&quot; that a fourth shot was fired from the grassy knoll, but they stated that this shot missed Kennedy. Concerning the conclusions of &quot;probable conspiracy&quot;, four of the twelve committee members wrote dissenting opinions.

The HSCA also concluded that previous investigations into Oswald&#x27;s responsibility were &quot;thorough and reliable&quot; but did not adequately investigate the possibility of a conspiracy, and that federal agencies performed with &quot;varying degrees of competency&quot;. Specifically, the FBI and CIA were found to be deficient in sharing information with other agencies and the Warren Commission. Instead of furnishing all relevant information, the FBI and CIA only responded to specific requests and were still occasionally inadequate. Furthermore, the Secret Service did not properly analyze information it possessed prior to the assassination and was inadequately prepared to protect Kennedy.

The chief reason for the conclusion of &quot;probable conspiracy&quot; was, according to the report&#x27;s dissent, the subsequently discredited acoustic analysis of a police channel Dictabelt recording. In accordance with the recommendations of the HSCA, the Dictabelt recording and acoustic evidence of a second assassin was subsequently reexamined. In light of investigative reports from the FBI&#x27;s Technical Services Division and a specially appointed National Academy of Sciences Committee determining that &quot;reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman&quot;, the Justice Department concluded &quot;that no persuasive evidence can be identified to support the theory of a conspiracy&quot; in the Kennedy assassination.

===JFK Act and Assassination Records Review Board===
In 1991, Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;JFK&quot; renewed interest in the assassination and particularly in the still-classified files relating to the killing. In response, Congress passed the JFK Records Act, which called for the National Archives to collect and release all assassination-related documents within 25 years. The act also mandated the creation of an independent office, the Assassination Records Review Board, to review the submitted records for completeness and continued secrecy. From 1994 until 1998, the Assassination Records Review Board gathered and unsealed about 60,000 documents comprising over 4 million pages.

A 1998 staff report for the Assassinations Records Review Board contended that brain photographs in the Kennedy records may not be of Kennedy&#x27;s brain, reportedly showing much less damage than Kennedy sustained. Dr. Boswell refuted these allegations. The board also found that, conflicting with the photographic images showing no such defect, several witnesses (at both Parkland hospital and the autopsy) remembered a large wound in the back of Kennedy&#x27;s head. The board, and board member Jeremy Gunn, stressed the problems with witness testimony, urging people to weigh all of the evidence, with due concern for human error, rather than take single statements as &quot;proof&quot; for one theory or another.

All remaining assassination-related records were scheduled to be released by October 2017, with the exception of documents certified for continued postponement by succeeding presidents due to &quot;identifiable harm... to the military, defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations... of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure.&quot; President Donald Trump said in October 2017 that he would not block the release of documents, but in April 2018—the deadline he set to release all JFK records—Trump blocked the release of some records until October 2021. President Joe Biden, citing the COVID-19 pandemic, delayed the release further, before releasing 13,173 unredacted documents in 2022. A second group of files were unsealed in June 2023, at which point 99 percent of documents had been made public.

Three days after entering office for the second time in January 2025, Trump signed an executive order to declassify the remaining documents pertaining to the assassination within 15 days. After the deadline elapsed, the FBI announced that it uncovered over 2,400 secret documents related to the assassination and were preparing the documents for declassification. 
==Conspiracy theories==

The Kennedy assassination has been described as &quot;the mother of all conspiracies&quot;.
For decades, polls have consistently found that a majority of Americans believe there was a conspiracy; some 1,000 to 2,000 books—mostly pro-conspiracy—have been written about the killing. Across different theories, Oswald&#x27;s role varies from co-conspirator to entirely innocent. Common culprits include the FBI, the CIA, the U.S. military, the Mafia, the military-industrial complex, Vice President Johnson, Castro, the KGB, or some combination thereof. Bugliosi estimated that a total of 42 groups, 82 assassins, and 214 people had been accused in various assassination theories.

Conspiracy theorists often argue that there were multiple shooters—a &quot;triangulation of crossfire&quot;—and that the fatal shot was fired from the grassy knoll and struck Kennedy in the front of the head. Individuals present in Dealey Plaza have been the subject of much speculation, including the three tramps, the umbrella man, and the purported Badge Man. Conspiracy theorists argue that the autopsy and official investigations were flawed or, at worst, complicit, and that witnesses to the Kennedy assassination met mysterious and suspicious deaths.

Conspiracy theories have been espoused by notable figures, such as L. Fletcher Prouty, Chief of Special Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Kennedy, who believed that elements of the U.S. military and intelligence communities had conspired to assassinate the president. Governor Connally also rejected the single-bullet theory, and President Johnson reportedly expressed doubt regarding the Warren Commission&#x27;s conclusions prior to his death. According to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his father believed that the Warren Report was a &quot;shoddy piece of craftsmanship&quot; and that John F. Kennedy had been killed by a conspiracy, possibly involving Cuban exiles and the CIA. Communist rulers like Castro and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev believed that Kennedy had been killed by right-wing Americans. Former CIA director R. James Woolsey has argued that Oswald killed Kennedy as part of a Soviet conspiracy.

==Legacy==
===Political impact and memorialization===
On November 27—five days after the assassination—President Johnson delivered his &quot;Let Us Continue&quot; speech to Congress. Effectively an inaugural address, Johnson called for the realization of Kennedy&#x27;s policies, particularly on civil rights; this effort soon materialized as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Confusion surrounding Johnson&#x27;s succession led to the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the U.S Constitution, which was adopted in 1967 and affirmed that the vice president became president upon the president&#x27;s death.

On November 29, President Johnson issued Executive Order 11129, renaming Florida&#x27;s Cape Canaveral—a name borne since at least 1530—to Cape Kennedy. NASA&#x27;s Launch Operations Center, located on the cape, was also renamed as the Kennedy Space Center. The federal government honored Kennedy in other ways, such as replacing the Benjamin Franklin half dollar with the Kennedy half dollar, and renaming Washington, D.C.&#x27;s long-planned National Culture Center as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. New York City&#x27;s airport was also renamed as the John F. Kennedy International Airport.

Kennedy&#x27;s assassination also resulted in an overhaul of the Secret Service and its procedures. Open limousines were eliminated, staffing was significantly increased, and specialized teams like counter-sniper units were established. The agency&#x27;s budget has also increased, from $5.5 million in 1963 () to over $1.6 billion by the 50th anniversary in 2013.

===Cultural impact and depictions===
John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination was the first of four major assassinations during the 1960s, coming two years before the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, and five years before the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. For the public, Kennedy&#x27;s assassination mythologized him into a heroic figure. Although scholars typically regard Kennedy as a good but not great president, public opinion polls consistently find him the most popular post-WWII president.

Kennedy&#x27;s murder left a lasting impression on many worldwide. As with the attack on Pearl Harbor of December 7, 1941, and, much later, the September 11 attacks in 2001, asking &quot;Where were you when you heard about President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination?&quot; became a common topic of discussion. Journalist Dan Rather opined that the Kennedy assassination will be discussed &quot;a hundred years from now, a thousand years from now, in somewhat the same way as people discuss the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Different people read Homer&#x27;s description of the war and come to different conclusions, and so it shall be for Kennedy&#x27;s death.&quot;

Along with Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;JFK&quot;, the assassination has been portrayed in several films: the pro-conspiracy, Dalton Trumbo–written &quot;Executive Action&quot; (1973) was the first feature film to depict the assassination. Besides explicit portrayals, some critics have argued that the Zapruder film—which itself has been featured in many films and television episodes—advanced cinéma vérité or inspired more graphic depictions of violence in American cinema. Many works of literature have also explored the killing, such as Don DeLillo&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;Libra&quot;, in which Oswald is a CIA agent, James Ellroy&#x27;s 1995 work &quot;American Tabloid&quot;, and Stephen King&#x27;s 2011 time travel novel &quot;11/22/63&quot;. The assassination has also been featured in several musical compositions, such as Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s 1964 piece &quot;Elegy for J.F.K.&quot; and Phil Ochs&#x27; 1966 song &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, which reportedly brought Robert Kennedy to tears. Other songs include &quot;Abraham, Martin and John&quot; (1968) and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Murder Most Foul&quot; (2020).

===Artifacts, museums, and locations today===
In 1993, the National Park Service designated Dealey Plaza, the surrounding buildings, the overpass, and a portion of the adjacent railyard as a National Historic Landmark District. The Depository and its Sixth Floor Museum, operated by the city of Dallas, draw over 325,000 visitors annually.

The Boeing 707 that served as Air Force One at the time of the assassination is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force; Kennedy&#x27;s limousine is at the Henry Ford Museum. The Lincoln Catafalque, on which Kennedy&#x27;s coffin rested in the Capitol, is exhibited at the Capitol Visitor Center. Jacqueline&#x27;s pink suit, autopsy X-rays, and President Kennedy&#x27;s blood-stained clothing are in the National Archives, with access controlled by the Kennedy family. Other items in the Archives include Parkland Hospital trauma room equipment; Oswald&#x27;s rifle, diary, and revolver; bullet fragments; and the limousine&#x27;s windshield. The Texas State Archives preserve Connally&#x27;s bullet-punctured clothes; the gun Ruby used to kill Oswald came into the possession of Ruby&#x27;s brother Earl, and was sold in 1991 for $220,000 ().

At the direction of Robert F. Kennedy, some items were destroyed. The casket in which Kennedy&#x27;s body was transported from Dallas to Washington was dropped into the sea, because &quot;its public display would be extremely offensive and contrary to public policy&quot;.

<doc id="286371" wikidata="Q554130" url="?curid=286371" title="Gynecologic hemorrhage">
<text>Gynecologic hemorrhage represents excessive bleeding of the female reproductive system. Such bleeding could be visible or external, namely bleeding from the vagina, or it could be internal into the pelvic cavity or form a hematoma. Normal menstruation is not considered a gynecologic hemorrhage, as it is not excessive. Hemorrhage associated with a pregnant state or during delivery is an obstetrical hemorrhage.

==Types==
*Metrorrhagia (metro = womb, -rrhagia = excessive flow) is uterine bleeding at irregular intervals, particularly between the expected menstrual periods.
*Postcoital bleeding is vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse.

==Causes==
Causes of gynecologic bleeding include: 

===Hormonal===
Anovulation is a common cause of gynecological hemorrhage. Under the influence of estrogen the endometrium (uterine lining) is stimulated and eventually such lining will be shed off (estrogen breakthrough bleeding). The anovulation chapter discusses its multiple possible causes. Longstanding anovulation can also lead to endometrial hyperplasia and facilitate the development of endometrial cancer.

===Neoplasm===
#Cancer of the uterus is always a concern, specifically when the bleeding occurs after menopause. Other types of cancer include cervical cancer; bleeding in that case can sometimes be triggered by postcoital bleeding. Cancers of the vagina or fallopian tubes are rare causes of hemorrhage.
#Uterine fibroids represent a common, benign condition that may lead to bleeding, specifically if the lesion affects the uterine cavity. 
#Polyps of the uterine lining are a common cause of bleeding, but such bleeding tends to be light.

===Trauma===
# Sexual assault and rape can lead to injury and gynecological hemorrhage. 
# Accidents to the lower abdomen may lead to internal or external bleeding.

===Bleeding disorder===

Women with a bleeding disorder may be prone to more excessive bleeding. A hematologic work-up should discover the cause.

===Other===
On occasion an ovarian cyst can rupture and give rise to internal hemorrhage. This may occur during ovulation or as a result of endometriosis.

If the pregnancy test is positive, consider pregnancy related bleeding (see obstetrical hemorrhage), including miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy.

==Diagnosis==
A history will establish if the condition is acute or chronic, and if external circumstances are involved. A gynecologic examination is usually complemented by a gynecologic ultrasonography. A blood count determines the degree of anemia and may point out bleeding problems. The pregnancy test is important, particularly as bleeding in early pregnancy presents as gynecological hemorrhage and ectopic pregnancy can be fatal.
Diagnosis is broadly classified into supportive and definitive investigations:

=== Supportive ===
# Complete blood count to assess degree of anemia.
# Ultrasonography to rule out uterine lesions, PID.

=== Definitive ===
# Pregnancy test for those who are not yet post menopausal mandatory.
# Speculum examination to take samples for pap smear.
# Dilation and curettage to get samples for histology and also control the bleeding if associated with abortion.
# Colposcopy.
===Definition===
Menstruation occurs typically monthly, lasts 3–7 days, and involves up to 80 ml blood. Bleeding in excess of this norm in a nonpregnant woman constitutes gynecologic hemorrhage. In addition, early pregnancy bleeding has sometimes been included as gynecologic hemorrhage, namely bleeding from a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy, while it actually represents obstetrical bleeding. However, from a practical view, early pregnancy bleeding is usually handled like a gynecological hemorrhage.

===First aid===
Gynecologic hemorrhage needs to be evaluated as soon as possible by a physician. The amount and duration of bleeding will dictate whether a bleeding event is an emergency event.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on diagnosis and may include hormonal therapy, iv fluids, blood transfusion, and/or a dilation and curettage. Internal bleeding requires laparoscopy or abdominal surgery, in rare and extreme cases a hysterectomy is performed.

<doc id="286372" wikidata="Q170103" url="?curid=286372" title="Gendarmenmarkt">
<text>The is a square in Berlin and the site of an architectural ensemble that includes the Berlin concert hall, along with the French and German Churches. In the centre of the square stands a monumental statue of poet Friedrich Schiller. The square was created by Johann Arnold Nering at the end of the seventeenth century as the Linden-Markt and reconstructed by Georg Christian Unger in 1773. The Gendarmenmarkt is named after a Prussian cuirassier regiment called the , which had stables at the square until 1773.

During World War II, most of the buildings were badly damaged or destroyed. They have all been restored.

==Origins==
The square was originally built in 1688. It was a marketplace and part of the city&#x27;s Western expansion of Friedrichstadt, one of Berlin&#x27;s emerging quarters.

== Französischer Dom ==

The French Cathedral (in German: &quot;Französischer Dom&quot;, where &quot;Dom&quot; refers to the &quot;dome&quot; and not to a cathedral. Neither the French nor the German Church was ever the seat of a bishop. The terminology is a relic of francophone Frederick the Great, who was instrumental in enhancing the Gendarmenmarkt) is the older of the two churches and was built by the Huguenot community between 1701 and 1705. It was modelled after the destroyed Huguenot church in Charenton-Saint-Maurice, France. The tower and porticoes, designed by Carl von Gontard, were added to the building in 1785. The French Church has a viewing platform, a restaurant and a Huguenot museum.

== Deutscher Dom ==

The German Cathedral (in German: &quot;Deutscher Dom&quot;) is located to the south of the Gendarmenmarkt. It has a pentagonal structure and was designed by Martin Grünberg and built in 1708 by Giovanni Simonetti. This church belonged to the Lutheran community. It too was modified in 1785 by Carl von Gontard, who built the domed tower. The German Church was completely destroyed by fire in 1945, during World War II. After German reunification it was rebuilt, finished in 1993 and re-opened in 1996 as a museum of German history.
== Konzerthaus ==

The Konzerthaus Berlin is the most recent building on the Gendarmenmarkt. It was built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel in 1821 as the &quot;Schauspielhaus&quot;. It was based on the ruins of the National Theatre, which had been destroyed by fire in 1817. Parts of the building contain columns and some outside walls from the destroyed building. Like the other buildings on the square, it was also badly damaged during World War II. The reconstruction, finished in 1984, turned the theatre into a concert hall. Today, it is the home of the Konzerthausorchester Berlin.

The Gendarmenmarkt hosts one of Berlin&#x27;s most popular Christmas markets.

<doc id="286374" wikidata="Q242369" url="?curid=286374" title="Lesser flamingo">
<text>The lesser flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor) is a species of flamingo occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and western India. Birds are occasionally reported from further north, but these are generally considered vagrants.

==Characteristics==
The lesser flamingo is the smallest species of flamingo, though it is a tall and large bird by most standards. The species can weigh from . The standing height is around . The total length (from beak to tail) and wingspan are in the same range of measurements, from . Most of the plumage is pinkish white. The clearest difference between this species and the greater flamingo, the only other Old World species of flamingo, is the much more extensive black on the bill. Size is less helpful to distinguish the two species, unless they occur together, since the sexes of each species also differ in height.

The extinct species &quot;Phoeniconaias proeses&quot; in the same genus, from the Pliocene of Australia, is thought to have been even smaller. 

The lesser flamingo may be the most common species of flamingo, with a population that (at its peak) probably numbered up to two million individual birds. This species feeds primarily on &quot;Spirulina&quot;, algae which grow only in very alkaline lakes. Presence of flamingo groups near water bodies is an indication of sodic alkaline water which is not suitable for irrigation use. Although blue-green in colour, the algae contain the photosynthetic pigments that give the birds their pink colour. Their deep bill is specially adapted for filtering tiny food items. Other forms of algae taken are &quot;Synechocystis minuscula&quot;, &quot;Synechococcus pevalekii&quot;, &quot;Synechococcus elongatus&quot;, &quot;Monoraphidium minutum&quot;, &quot;Oscillatoria&quot; sp. and &quot;Lyngbya&quot; sp. This species will also feed, to a lesser extent, on small invertebrates: copepods (&quot;Paradiaptomus africanus&quot;), diatoms (&quot;Navicula&quot;) and rotifers (&quot;Brachionus&quot;), as well as microscopic alkaliphilic cyanobacteria (&quot;Arthrospira fusiformis&quot;, &quot;A. maxima&quot;).

==Predators==
Lesser flamingos are prey to a variety of species, including marabou storks, vultures, baboons, African fish eagles, jackals, hyenas, foxes, Great white pelicans, Martial Eagle, and big cats.

==Breeding==

In Africa, where they are most common, the lesser flamingos breed principally on the highly caustic Lake Natron in northern Ngorongoro District in Arusha Region of Tanzania. Their other African breeding sites are at Etosha Pan, Makgadikgadi Pan, and Kamfers Dam. The last confirmed breeding season at Aftout es Saheli in coastal Mauritania was in 1965. Breeding occurred at Lake Magadi in Kenya in 1962 when Lake Natron was unsuitable due to flooding. In the early 20th century, breeding was also observed at Lake Nakuru.

The species also breeds in southwestern and southern Asia. In 1974, they bred at the Rann of Kutch, but since then, only at the Zinzuwadia and Purabcheria salt pans in northwestern India. Some movement of individuals occurs between Africa and India.

Like all flamingos, they lay a single chalky-white egg on a mound they build of mud. Chicks join creches soon after hatching, sometimes numbering over 100,000 individuals. The creches are marshalled by a few adult birds that lead them by foot to fresh water, a journey that can reach over .

==Threats==
Despite being the most common species of flamingo, it is classified as near threatened due to its declining population and the low number of breeding sites, some of which are threatened by human activities.

The population in the two key East African lakes, Lake Nakuru and Lake Bogoria, have been adversely affected in recent years by suspected heavy metal poisoning, while its primary African breeding area in Lake Natron is currently under threat by a proposed soda ash plant by Tata Chemicals. The only breeding site in South Africa, situated at Kamfers Dam, is threatened by pollution and encroaching development. East African soda lake productivity declines due to rising water levels are another threat to the lesser flamingo.

<text>Unter den Linden (, &quot;under the linden trees&quot;) is a boulevard in the central Mitte district of Berlin, Germany. Running from the Berlin Palace to the Brandenburg Gate, it is named after the linden trees (known as lime in the UK and Ireland and basswood in North America, not related to citrus lime) that line the grassed pedestrian mall on the median and the two broad carriageways. The avenue links numerous Berlin sights, landmarks and rivers for sightseeing.

==Overview==

Unter den Linden runs east–west from the Berlin Palace, the former main residence of the royal House of Hohenzollern, reconstructed (after the demolition of the communist Palace of the Republic) on its old site opposite the Lustgarten park, to Pariser Platz and Brandenburg Gate. Major north–south streets crossing &quot;Unter den Linden&quot; are Friedrichstraße and Wilhelmstrasse, both meeting at Mehringplatz and running across the Friedrichstadt, a city expansion founded in 1691.

Eastward the boulevard crosses the Spree river, slightly kinked due to the oblique position of the long side of the palace compared to the boulevard, at the Lustgarten with Berlin Cathedral, and continues as Karl-Liebknecht-Straße, itself continued as Prenzlauer Allee, to the northern outskirts. The western, dead straight continuation behind Brandenburg Gate is the Straße des 17. Juni (formerly &quot;Charlottenburger Chaussee&quot;), which in turn is extended to the west by the straight sequence of Bismarckstrasse and Kaiserdamm, an axis, widened in 1904, that runs from Berlin Palace more than 10 kilometers across the city to the western outskirts where, slightly elevated, one can survey the length of the axis. The extension of the &quot;Linden&quot; alley to this gigantic axis was inspired by the Boulevards of Paris. The Kurfürstendamm, the magnificent shopping mile in the historically elegant west of Berlin, was similarly inspired.
Unter den Linden, which sits at the heart of the historic section of Berlin, developed from a bridle path laid out by Elector John George of Brandenburg in the 16th century to reach his hunting grounds in the Tiergarten from his palace. It was replaced by a boulevard of linden trees when the Electress Dorothea Sophie planned a new suburb in 1674, named after her Dorotheenstadt. She is said to have planted the first linden tree in 1680. Parts of the fortification of Berlin built in the aftermath of the Thirty Years&#x27; War (the baroque Berlin Fortress) were later integrated into the boulevard, around the historic &quot;Opernplatz&quot;, the present-day Bebelplatz, visible until today as there are no trees on this stretch up to the palace on the Spree river island itself. Bebelplatz itself was planned by Frederick the Great as a much larger &quot;Forum Fridericianum&quot;, albeit on a smaller scale actually realized with his State Opera, St. Hedwig&#x27;s Cathedral, the &quot;Old Library Building&quot; and the &quot;Palace of Prince Henry&quot;, today the main building of Humboldt University, giving the square an almost complete surround of 18th-century buildings. 
By the 19th century, as Berlin grew and expanded to the west, Unter den Linden became the most renowned and grandest street in Berlin. In 1851 the famous equestrian statue of Frederick the Great, designed by Christian Daniel Rauch, was erected on the central strip. Johann Strauss III wrote the waltz &quot;Unter den Linden&quot; in 1900. In the course of the building of the Nord-Süd-Tunnel for the Berlin S-Bahn in 1934–35, most of the linden trees were cut down and during the last days of World War II the remaining trees were destroyed or cut down for firewood. The present-day linden were replanted in the 1950s.

As the location of the pre-1914 German Foreign Ministry building, &quot;the Under den Linden&quot; was sometimes used as a shorthand for the German government when talking of German foreign policy.

==Points of interest==

Since 1937, the numbering of the properties on the street has started at the &quot;Schlossbrücke&quot; (Palace Bridge), which connects Unter den Linden with the Lustgarten and Museum Island. The reconstructed Alte Kommandantur is at No. 1, standing opposite the Zeughaus arsenal, the oldest building on Unter den Linden, built between 1695 and 1706, now the seat of the &quot;Deutsches Historisches Museum&quot;, No. 2. Buildings along the street include (from east to west) the Crown Prince&#x27;s Palace (the former palace of the Hohenzollern crown princes), at No. 3, opposite the Neue Wache war memorial, No. 4, Karl Friedrich Schinkel’s masterpiece built in 1817. Further along, on Bebelplatz, the Berlin State Opera, No. 7, colloquially called &quot;Lindenoper&quot;, St. Hedwig&#x27;s Cathedral and the &quot;Altes Palais&quot;, No. 9, (Old Palace, Berlin) a favourite Neoclassical residence of Emperor Wilhelm I; next, on the north side lies the main building of the Humboldt University, No. 6, and House I of the Berlin State Library, No. 8. At the western end are the Russian Embassy (former Soviet Embassy, Nos. 63-65, the Hungarian Embassy, No. 76, standing at the junction with Wilhelmstrasse, and finally the Hotel Adlon, No. 77, at the corner of Pariser Platz, which has been completely rebuilt on the site of the pre-war hotel. Well-known statues of Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt in front of the university as well as of the Prussian generals Scharnhorst and Bülow, also adorn the street.
A street sign carrying the name Unter den Linden dating from before the 1930s was taken away by British forces and can now be seen at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>The Ford Focus is a compact car (C-segment in Europe) manufactured by Ford Motor Company since 1998. It was created under Alexander Trotman&#x27;s Ford 2000 plan, which aimed to globalize model development and sell one compact vehicle worldwide. The original Focus was primarily designed by Ford of Europe&#x27;s German and British teams. Production of the fourth generation Focus began in 2018 in Germany and China.

== Naming ==
The decision to name the new car the &quot;Ford Focus&quot; was made in early 1998, as Ford&#x27;s senior management had been planning to keep the &quot;Escort&quot; nameplate for its new generation of small family cars. A last-minute problem arose in July 1998 when a Cologne court, responding to a case brought by the publisher Burda, ordered Ford to avoid the name &quot;Focus&quot; for the cars in the German market since the name was already taken by one of its magazines. This eleventh-hour dispute was resolved, however, and the car was launched with the name &quot;Focus&quot;.

== First generation (C170; 1998) ==


Ford of Europe introduced the Focus in 1998 to the European market as a replacement for the Ford Escort. The Focus Mk 1 was awarded the 1999 European Car of the Year award. The project manager for the Ford Focus at Dunton was Rose Mary Farenden.

Ford of North America began marketing the Focus in September 1999 for the 2000 model year, with some changes from the European version. The car was launched as a three-door hatchback, four-door sedan, and five-door wagon; a five-door hatchback debuted in 2001.

In 2002, Ford launched its highest performance version of the Focus, called the Focus RS. It came with a 2.0-litre turbocharged &quot;Duratec RS&quot; engine, a Quaife ATB limited-slip differential, an AP Racing clutch, and a revolutionary design front suspension strut system called &quot;Revo-knuckle&quot;- as marketed by Ford, Sachs Racing dampers, Brembo brakes, 18” O.Z Racing alloy wheels, Michelin Pilot Sport tyres and a host of other performance changes, combined with a much more aggressive appearance, and was available only in Ford&#x27;s Imperial blue. Tickford Engineering won the engineering contract for the research, development and to oversee production of the Mk 1 Focus RS. Tickford made substantial modifications to the base unit, with up to 70% of the base components either updated, re-engineered or completely redesigned. Despite the development being carried out in the United Kingdom, Ford produced the Focus RS in the Saarlouis plant in Germany between 2002 and 2003 making a limited run of 4501 cars only. This original Focus RS was only available in Europe; just under half (2147) of these were sold in the UK.

For decades, in the U.S., small cars like the Focus were seen as a tool to draw in younger buyers looking for a cheap basic transportation and to increase auto makers&#x27; fleet average fuel economies to meet U.S. federal standards. Ford was said not to be concerned about losing money on the Focus so the company could sell gas guzzlers for big profits. However, recent sales of new Focuses have been able to maintain lower or overall discounting incentive rates than many competing vehicles in its class. Many industry insiders view cars like the Focus as &#x27;compliance cars&#x27; because of their role in helping to bring up the corporate fleet average fuel economy to meet current fuel-economy standards.
==Second generation (C307/C170; 2004)==

===Europe (C307; 2004)===


The second generation Focus was launched at the Paris Motor Show on September 25, 2004, as a three and five-door hatchback and an estate, although the new car was previewed, in 4-door sedan form, as the &quot;Focus Concept&quot; developed by Ford Europe at the Beijing Motor Show in mid-2004.

The basic suspension design, which contributed much to the Mk 1&#x27;s success, was carried over largely unchanged from its predecessor. Along with a 10 percent stiffer bodyshell, according to Ford this offers a better ride, but critics claimed the car lacked the precise and poised handling of the Mk 1. The same body styles as the Mk 1 Focus were offered, though the sedan did not appear until mid-2005. A two-door coupé-cabriolet with a retractable hardtop was added to the line-up in 2007.

The Focus Mk 2 is larger and considerably heavier than its predecessor: it has a increase in wheelbase, and is longer, taller, and wider. As a result, the interior and boot space have increased. New technologies include a KeyFree system, a solar-reflect windshield, adaptive front lighting, Bluetooth hands-free phones and voice control for audio, telephone, and climate control systems.

Stylistically, the Mk 2 features the same design language found in the Mondeo and Fiesta. Although still recognisable as a Focus, the new car uses styling features from the abandoned B-Proposal for the &quot;original&quot; Focus which never reached production.

In 2005, Ford released a MK.II version of Ford&#x27;s sports division of Focus, the Focus ST. This one produced and could achieve a time of 6.4 seconds, and a top speed, using a 2.5-litre, five-cylinder turbocharged engine originating from Volvo.

2007–2008 saw a minor facelifted version introduced, featuring Ford&#x27;s Kinetic Design philosophy. Major changes included a new bonnet with more creases, the removal of all mouldings along the doors and sides, new sculpted pull back headlights, and the big trapezoidal lower grille.

In 2009, the new Focus RS was launched, with a modified version of the 2.5-litre engine found in the ST.
===North America (C170; 2007)===


For the North American market, development followed a separate path. Since debuting at the 2007 North American International Auto Show, the restyled 2008–2011 generation was available as a two-door coupe and four-door sedan; the hatchbacks and wagon were discontinued. The interior was redesigned, including new seats, a new dashboard design with message center on top of the dashboard, ambient lighting, dashboard panels that simulate brushed aluminum, and Ford&#x27;s voice-controlled Sync audio/Bluetooth system. Also included in the redesign was a support beam behind the dashboard for extra structural rigidity.

Though informally considered as the second generation, it was never officially referred to as such by Ford since its platform was the same as the first generation.
==Third generation (C346; 2010)==


For the third generation, Ford reunited both international and North American models by releasing the international Mk 3 worldwide. The previous North American version was discontinued, and the new model was launched simultaneously in North America and Europe in early 2011, both having started production late in 2010.

Ford unveiled the Ford Focus at the 2010 North American International Auto Show. The car shown was a five-door hatchback model, also debuting a new 2.0-litre direct injection inline-four engine. A five-door station wagon was also made available at launch. The new generation launched simultaneously in North America and Europe in early 2011, with production having started in late 2010. Production in Asia, Africa, Australia and South America was scheduled to follow later but the plan for Australian production was later dropped and that market and New Zealand were supplied, along with Asia, from a new factory in Thailand where output began in June 2012.

Ford previewed the third generation facelifted model at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show. The updated version features a new redesigned front end design, incorporating Ford&#x27;s new family grille and slimline headlights. 

The Focus RS returned in 2015 now sporting an updated 2.3-liter EcoBoost engine. Built in Ford&#x27;s Germany plant Saarlouis, the Focus RS was updated to be given an advanced all-wheel drive system that could send full power to the rear wheels if allowed.

==Fourth generation (C519; 2018)==


On April 10, 2018, Ford unveiled the European and Asian-market versions of the fourth-generation Focus, to mark the brand&#x27;s 20th anniversary. As in the previous generation, the model is available with sedan, hatchback and estate body styles. A crossover-inspired trim level known as the &quot;Active&quot; is available with the hatchback and estate body styles. The car also has a &quot;Vignale&quot; luxury trim level.

The exterior features a sportier design, while Ford described its interior as being simpler. The company also emphasized technology featured in the new model, including the Sync 3 infotainment system, FordPass Connect, and the CoPilot360 driver assistance suite.

In April 2018, Ford announced that all passenger vehicles but the Mustang would be discontinued in the North American market, in order to focus on trucks and SUVs. The Focus Active was intended to be the only version of the model available in the market, but Ford cancelled these plans in August 2018 over tariffs imposed by the U.S. government on exports from China, as the model would be manufactured in the country.

Ford limited sales of fourth generation Focus in its 4-door saloon form in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Turkey, Cyprus as well as many Asian and African countries. Ford no longer offers the Focus in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan due to a broader reorganization of their European branch.

In April 2020, Ford confirmed there are no plans for a fourth-generation Focus RS model due to pan-European emissions standards and high development costs.

In October 2021, the model received a facelift for the European market.

In 2022, it was announced that Ford would discontinue the Focus by 2025, as part of a pivot towards crossover vehicles and electrification.

==Motorsport==

===Rallying===

The first MkI Focus World Rally Car made its debut in rallying and the World Rally Championship on the 1999 Monte Carlo Rally with Colin McRae and Simon Jean-Joseph at the wheels of the two cars, replacing the Escort. It was immediately on the pace, setting many fastest stage times, but an illegal water pump meant that the two cars were excluded from that event. McRae went on to give the Focus WRC its maiden victory on the Safari Rally in February of the same year, and took victory again in the following rally, the Rally Portugal. The MkI Focus WRC went on to achieve further victories over the years for McRae, Carlos Sainz, and Markko Märtin from then until it was phased out in favour of the MkII offering in late 2005. 

The second generation MkII Focus World Rally Car was a winner in both Marcus Grönholm&#x27;s and Mikko Hirvonen&#x27;s hands in the two-car factory BP-Ford World Rally Team that contested the 2006 World Rally Championship, duly racked up the manufacturers&#x27; title, spelling the end of a formidable twenty-seven-year wait for such an honour in this series for the Blue Oval. The team successfully defended the manufacturers&#x27; title in the 2007 season. The MkII Focus WRC was used until the 2010 season, when it was announced that the new Fiesta would replace it from 2011 onwards.

All the rally cars were built, prepared, and run for Ford by M-Sport, the motorsport team based in Cockermouth, Cumbria in Northern England. The team was managed by Malcolm Wilson, a well known British former rally driver.

===Touring cars===
Besides rallies, the Focus has also been used in the SCCA Speed World Challenge Touring Car Series, the TC 2000, resulting champion in 2003, 2005, 2010, and 2012.

A Focus was entered into the 2006 Swedish Touring Car Championship season.

The Ford Focus ST made its debut in the 2009 British Touring Car Championship season, with Arena Motorsport. During its second season, the car ran on liquefied petroleum gas, taking the first BTCC win for a car powered by this fuel at Brands Hatch. In 2011, Arena (also known as Team AON) shifted to the newer Focus Mk3, while Motorbase Performance drove the ST version. Both cars had engines built to the Next Generation Touring Car engine rules. Motorbase continues to compete with the Ford Focus ST.

This car won four drivers&#x27; championships of the Argentine TC 2000/Súper TC 2000 championship (2003, 2005, 2010 and 2012). The first three of the Oreste Berta Ford YPF team with official support from Ford Argentina.

Arena Motorsport entered two Ford Focus Mk3s in the 2012 World Touring Car Championship season for Tom Chilton and James Nash. The best result was a sixth place by Nash in the Race of Morocco.

In 2008 Ford South Africa entered two modified Focus ST models into Class T (reserved for turbocharged production vehicles) of the local Bridgestone Production Car Championship (essentially a Touring Car formula). They secured the Class T driver&#x27;s titles in 2009 and 2011.

The car had success in the 2013 China Touring Car Championship, and won its class in the 2014 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour. The Focus that raced in the 2014 Bathurst 12 Hour was powered by a 5.0 L Ford Coyote V8 engine.

==Sales==
== Future ==
Ford of Europe&#x27;s chairman and former president, Stuart Rowley has told journalists in June 2022 that Ford plans to end production of the Focus at the Saarlouis plant in Germany around 2025. There was no indication of when production would end in China.

<doc id="286379" wikidata="Q178788" url="?curid=286379" title="Mrs Craddock">
<text>Mrs Craddock is a novel by William Somerset Maugham first published in 1902.

==Plot introduction==
Set in the final years of the 19th century, &quot;Mrs Craddock&quot; is about a young and attractive woman of independent means who marries beneath her. As he had written about a subject that was considered daring at the time, Maugham had some difficulty finding a publisher. Completed in 1900, the novel was eventually published in 1902 by William Heinemann, but only on the condition that the author took out passages which, according to Heinemann, might have offended the readers. A successful and popular book, &quot;Mrs Craddock&quot; was reissued in 1903 and again in 1908. In 1938 the first non-Bowdlerized version, stylistically improved by Maugham, came out.

==Plot summary==

On her 21st birthday, when she comes into her deceased father&#x27;s money, Bertha Ley announces, to the dismay of her former guardian, that she is going to marry 27-year-old Edward Craddock, her steward. Herself a member of the landed gentry, Bertha has been raised to cultivate an &quot;immoderate desire for knowledge&quot; and to understand, and enjoy, European culture of both past and present ages. In particular, during long stays on the Continent, she has learned to appreciate Italy&#x27;s tremendous cultural heritage. A &quot;virtuous&quot; girl, her views on womanhood are thoroughly traditional. She has no doubts about her role in life, which will be to serve and obey her future husband. When Bertha encourages reluctant Edward Craddock, whom she has known since their childhood, to propose to her, she is certain that she will find absolute fulfilment and happiness in her marriage, even if it means abandoning city life and its pleasures for the Kentish coast &quot;to live as her ancestors had lived, ploughing the land, sowing and reaping; but her children, the sons of the future, would belong to a new stock, stronger and fairer than the old. The Leys had gone down into the darkness of death, and her children would bear another name. […] She felt in herself suddenly the weariness of a family that had lived too long; she knew she was right to choose new blood to mix with the old blood of the Leys. It needed the freshness and youth, the massive strength of her husband, to bring life to the decayed race.&quot; (Ch.8)

The man selected by Bertha in an almost Darwinian fashion to accomplish all this is described by the narrator as little more than a noble savage, &quot;the unspoiled child of nature, his mind free from the million perversities of civilization&quot; (Ch.7). Edward Craddock may be tall, strong, handsome, and practically free from sin (&quot;He simply reeks of the Ten Commandments&quot;), but at the same time he is hardly educated, unimaginative, and unnecessarily headstrong. Subconsciously justifying her decision to marry him, Bertha boosts his ego by constantly telling him that he will rise above himself if he is given the chance to do so, and accordingly transfers all powers to manage her estate to her husband. As time goes by, Craddock turns into the archetypal country squire, accepted, respected, even adored and envied by the community, who have no idea that in the meantime his wife has drawn her own, less favourable, conclusions about their married life.

After their honeymoon, which they spend in London, Bertha soon realises that her husband is a bore and, what is more, rather insensitive to her needs. Time and again she pokes fun at his inferior taste in music, his inability and unwillingness to read books, and his chauvinism. She is disappointed at the routine that dominates their marriage and at the lack of attentions he pays her. It gradually dawns upon her that Edward lives in a world of his own, in which the death of a cow causes him more grief than that of a beloved person. When, a bit more than a year into their marriage, Bertha is eight months pregnant and has a premonition that there might be complications during birth, he assures her that &quot;it&#x27;s nothing to make a fuss about&quot;, his insight stemming from his own experience: &quot;He had bred animals for years, and was quite used to the process that supplied him with veal, mutton and beef for the local butchers. It was a ridiculous fuss that human beings made over a natural and ordinary phenomenon.&quot; (Ch.16)

However, their son is stillborn, and Bertha is told that she will not be able to have children in future either. The ensuing crisis makes her doubt that God exists, while the vicar&#x27;s sister, a friend of theirs, asserts that &quot;we should be thankful for the cross we have to bear. It is, as it were, a measure of the confidence that God places in us.&quot; (Ch.18) Finding no solace in religion—at least that kind of religion—but at the same time unable to get over the loss of her son and also increasingly disgusted by her husband&#x27;s matter-of-fact behaviour, Bertha escapes her dreary surroundings and finds refuge in London, where she moves into her aunt&#x27;s flat. Mary Ley, in her late forties and unmarried, senses right from the start that Bertha means to leave her husband for good but, for the sake of her niece&#x27;s peace of mind, is not prepared to broach the subject. Edward, on the other hand, is happily unaware of his wife&#x27;s intentions, considering himself nothing more than a grass widower and urging his wife in several letters to come home as soon as she has fully recovered. After a prolonged trip with her aunt to Paris, made under the pretext of intending to buy dresses, Bertha, for want of any other reasonable course of action, returns to Kent and her husband, thus erroneously confirming Edward in his belief that her going away was just a passing phase.

While his wife settles down to a life of quiet despair and excruciating boredom, Edward Craddock, who has become a stranger to her, embarks on a career in politics. Elected County Councillor for the Conservative Party, he immediately starts dreaming of climbing the ladder of success even further and becoming a member of parliament (MP). Five years after her wedding, aged only 26, Bertha not only feels that she has aged prematurely; she is also aware of the fact that in the eyes of the local community she has become a mere appendage to her husband. Never having had anyone to confide in, she at long last picks Dr Ramsay, the local GP and her former guardian, to tell him the truth about the passionate hatred she feels for Edward and to ask for the doctor&#x27;s help. &quot;I know him through and through&quot;, Bertha says of her husband, &quot;and he&#x27;s a fool. You can&#x27;t conceive how stupid, how utterly brainless he is. He bores me to death. […] Oh, when I think that I&#x27;m shackled to him for the rest of my life I feel I could kill myself.&quot; (Ch.27)

Again Bertha escapes to the Continent, again with her aunt, this time to Rome (while Edward Craddock has not once in his life been abroad). Claiming that her delicate health demands spending the winter in a warm climate, she is back in London in the following spring after having enjoyed six months of freedom but now must face reality again and no longer delay her return to her husband. This is when 19-year-old Gerald Vaudrey, a cousin of hers she has never met before, enters her life. Gerald, handsome and still looking like a schoolboy, is to stay in London for a couple of weeks to wait for his passage to the United States, where he has been assigned to go by his parents as a punishment for his misdemeanours. Visiting his—and Bertha&#x27;s – aunt, he is introduced to his cousin at Mary Ley&#x27;s flat, and from the moment they first set eyes on each other Bertha and Gerald are curiously attracted to each other. They go off almost every day exploring the sights of London, and 26-year-old Bertha, unable as well as unwilling to face the facts, feels flattered by the youth&#x27;s many attentions. She just does not really want to believe that Gerald has been expelled from his parental home after seducing the maid; she refuses to see a womaniser in Gerald and, although she tries hard to resist her feelings, genuinely falls in love with the boy.

At the very last moment, on the eve of Gerald&#x27;s departure, it occurs to Bertha that she might &quot;give Gerald the inestimable gift of her body&quot;, as &quot;there is one way in which a woman can bind a man to her for ever, there is one tie that is indissoluble; her very flesh cried out, and she trembled at the thought.&quot; (Ch.31) The young couple are already alone in their aunt&#x27;s flat, but Mary Ley comes home early from a dinner to which she has been invited, suspecting that they could be meeting secretly, and prevents any sexual activity. Gerald Vaudrey leaves for the States on the following morning. When, two weeks later, Bertha receives a letter from America, she puts it on the mantelpiece, where she looks at it for a month. Only then does she burn it, without ever having opened it. To her, having achieved this means that she has got over her infatuation.

Again Bertha Craddock returns to her husband and, after that &quot;mere spring day of happiness&quot; with Gerald, prepares for &quot;the long winter of life&quot;. Four years later, when she is 30, Edward Craddock breaks his neck in a riding accident, and, seeing his body being carried into the house, Bertha, for the first time since her wedding, feels free. Similar to the old custom of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; in the Roman Empire, she destroys all of Edward&#x27;s photographs and all of his letters to her.
