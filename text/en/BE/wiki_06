<text>Lucinda Gayl Williams (born January 26, 1953) is an American singer-songwriter and a solo guitarist. She recorded her first two albums, &quot;Ramblin&#x27; on My Mind&quot; (1979) and &quot;Happy Woman Blues&quot; (1980), in a traditional country and blues style that received critical praise but little public or radio attention. In 1988, she released her third album, &quot;Lucinda Williams&quot;, to widespread critical acclaim. Regarded as &quot;an Americana classic&quot;, the album also features &quot;Passionate Kisses&quot;, a song later recorded by Mary Chapin Carpenter for her 1992 album &quot;Come On Come On&quot;, which garnered Williams her first Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1994. Known for working slowly, Williams released her fourth album, &quot;Sweet Old World&quot;, four years later in 1992. &quot;Sweet Old World&quot; was met with further critical acclaim and was voted the 11th best album of 1992 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of prominent music critics. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, ranked it 6th on his own year-end list, later writing that the album as well as &quot;Lucinda Williams&quot; were &quot;gorgeous, flawless, brilliant&quot;.

Williams&#x27; commercial breakthrough came in 1998 with &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot;, an album presenting a broader scope of songs that fused rock, blues, country and Americana into a distinctive style that remained consistent and commercial in sound. &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot;, which includes the singles &quot;Right in Time&quot; and the Grammy nominated &quot;Can&#x27;t Let Go&quot;, became Williams&#x27; greatest commercial success to date. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA the following year, and earned her a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, while being universally acclaimed by critics. Williams&#x27; next album, &quot;Essence&quot;, appeared in 2001 to further critical acclaim and commercial success, becoming her first Top 40 album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 28. Featuring a more downbeat musical tone, with spare, intimate arrangements, &quot;Essence&quot; earned Williams three Grammy nominations in 2002: Best Contemporary Folk Album, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the title track, and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single &quot;Get Right With God&quot;, which she won.

One of the most celebrated singer-songwriters of her generation, Williams has released a string of albums since that have earned her further critical acclaim and commercial success, including &quot;World Without Tears&quot; (2003), &quot;West&quot; (2007), &quot;Little Honey&quot; (2008), &quot;Blessed&quot; (2011), &quot;Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone&quot; (2014), &quot;The Ghosts of Highway 20&quot; (2016), and &quot;Good Souls Better Angels&quot; (2020). Among her various accolades, she has won three Grammy Awards from 17 nominations, and has received two Americana Awards (one competitive, one honorary) from 11 nominations. Williams ranked No. 97 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Women in Rock &amp; Roll in 1999, and was named &quot;America&#x27;s best songwriter&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2002. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked her the 79th greatest songwriter of all time. In 2017, she received the Berklee College of Music Honorary Doctorate of Music Degree, and ranked No. 91 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time. In 2020, &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; ranked No. 97 and &quot;Lucinda Williams&quot; ranked No. 426 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. She was inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame in 2021. That same year, &quot;Passionate Kisses&quot; ranked No. 437 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Early life==
Williams was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana, the daughter of poet and literature professor Miller Williams, and amateur pianist Lucille Fern Day. Her parents divorced in the mid-1960s. Williams&#x27; father gained custody of her and her younger brother, Robert Miller, and sister, Karyn Elizabeth. Like her father, Williams has spina bifida. Her father worked as a visiting professor in Mexico and different parts of the United States, including Baton Rouge; New Orleans; Jackson, Mississippi; and Utah before settling at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. Williams never graduated from high school but was accepted into the University of Arkansas. Williams started writing when she was 6 years old. She showed an affinity for music at an early age, and was playing guitar at 12. Her first live performance was in Mexico City at 17, as part of a duo with her friend, banjo player Clark Jones.

==Career==
===1978–1987: Early career===
By her early 20s, Williams was playing publicly in Austin and Houston, Texas, concentrating on a blend of folk, rock, and country. She moved to Jackson, Mississippi, in 1978 to record her first album for Folkways Records. Released in 1979, and titled &quot;Ramblin&#x27; on My Mind&quot;, it was a collection of country and blues covers. Smithsonian Folkways provides a description: &quot;The first recordings from an artist with a gift for interpreting original blues from Robert Johnson to Memphis Minnie to the Carter Family. Williams&#x27; unmistakable sound is powerfully direct and filled with melancholy and passion.&quot; When the album was re-issued in 1991, the title was shortened to &quot;Ramblin&quot;&#x27;.

Williams&#x27; second album, &quot;Happy Woman Blues&quot;, appeared the following year, and consisted of her own material. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; felt the record was more &quot;rock-oriented&quot; than Williams&#x27; debut album, writing that she used timeworn ideas such as &quot;smoke-stained bars, open roads and a heart that never learns&quot; but reimagined them &quot;in a way that is both contemporary and uncynical&quot;. One album track, &quot;I Lost It&quot;, was re-recorded 18 years later for Williams&#x27; fifth album &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; (1998). In the 1980s, Williams moved to Los Angeles, California (before finally settling in Nashville, Tennessee), where, at times backed by a rock band and at others performing in acoustic settings, she developed a following and a critical reputation. While based in Los Angeles, she was briefly married to Long Ryders drummer Greg Sowders, whom she had met in a club.

===1988–1997: &quot;Lucinda Williams&quot;, &quot;Sweet Old World&quot;, and critical acclaim===
In 1988, Williams released her third album, &quot;Lucinda Williams&quot;, on Rough Trade Records. Produced by Williams, along with Gurf Morlix, and Dusty Wakeman, the album was met with widespread critical acclaim and was voted the 16th best album of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll. It has since been viewed as a leading work in the development of the Americana movement. In 2014, Robin Denselow called it &quot;an Americana classic&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, while Stephen M. Deusner wrote for CMT that it is &quot;a roots-rock landmark, ground zero for today&#x27;s burgeoning Americana movement&quot;. A retrospective review from AllMusic stated &quot;Every song packs an emotional punch line and rewards the listener each time with something new&quot;. The single &quot;Changed the Locks&quot;, about a broken relationship, received radio play around the country and gained fans among music insiders, including Tom Petty, who would later cover the song in 1996 on the soundtrack album to the Edward Burns film &quot;She&#x27;s The One&quot;. &quot;Lucinda Williams&quot; also features &quot;The Night&#x27;s Too Long&quot;, later recorded by Patty Loveless in 1990 for her album &quot;On Down the Line&quot;, and &quot;Passionate Kisses&quot;, later recorded by Mary Chapin Carpenter for her album &quot;Come On Come On&quot; (1992). Adhering closely in tempo, feel, and instrumentation to Williams&#x27; original recording, &quot;Passionate Kisses&quot; became a major hit for Carpenter, enhancing her crossover appeal and earning her the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 1994, while it earned Williams the Grammy Award for Best Country Song.

In 1991, the song &quot;Lucinda Williams&quot; appeared on Vic Chesnutt&#x27;s album &quot;West of Rome&quot;. The following year, Williams released her fourth album, &quot;Sweet Old World,&quot; on the Chameleon label. Also produced alongside Morlix and Wakeman, &quot;Sweet Old World&quot; is a melancholy album dealing with themes of suicide and death. The album received mass critical acclaim, and was voted the 11th best album of 1992 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop poll. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, ranked it 6th on his own year-end list, later writing that the album was &quot;gorgeous, flawless, brilliant [with] short-story details (&#x27;chess pieces,&#x27; &#x27;dresses that zip up the side&#x27;) packing a textural thrill akin to &quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey said it was just as good as her 1988 self-titled album, calling it &quot;a gorgeous, elegiac record that not only consolidates but expands Williams&#x27; ample talents.&quot; The track &quot;Something About What Happens When We Talk&quot; was later featured in the Cheryl Strayed biographical adventure film &quot;Wild&quot; (2014), starring Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern.

During this period, Williams&#x27; biggest commercial successes remained as a songwriter. Emmylou Harris said of Williams, &quot;She is an example of the best of what country at least says it is, but, for some reason, she&#x27;s completely out of the loop and I feel strongly that that&#x27;s country music&#x27;s loss.&quot; Harris later recorded the title track from &quot;Sweet Old World&quot; for her career-redefining 1995 album, &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;. In 1996, Williams duetted with Steve Earle on the song &quot;You&#x27;re Still Standin&#x27; There&quot; from his album &quot;I Feel Alright&quot;. Williams also gained a reputation as a perfectionist and slow worker when it came to recording; six years would pass before her next album release, though she appeared as a guest on other artists&#x27; albums and contributed to several tribute compilations during this period.

===1998–1999: &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; and commercial breakthrough===
Her long-awaited 1998 album &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; was Williams&#x27; breakthrough into the mainstream. The album received widespread critical acclaim, topping the annual Pazz &amp; Jop poll, and received a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album in 1999. It became Williams&#x27; first album to chart on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 68, and remaining on the chart for over five months. The album also went Gold within a year of release. Reviewing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in July 1998, David Browne found Williams&#x27; hard-edged evocations of Southern rural life refreshing amid a music market overrun by timid, mass-produced female artists, while &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau argued at the time that she proved herself to be the era&#x27;s &quot;most accomplished record-maker&quot; by honing traditional popular music composition, understated vocal emotions, and realistic narratives colored by her native experiences and values. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine called the record an alternative country masterpiece and ranked it No. 304 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and ranked it No. 305 in 2012&#x27;s revised list. In September 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; updated its Top 500 albums of all-time list, which reflected an updated and diverse judging pool, and the album rose to No. 98 on that list.

The single &quot;Can&#x27;t Let Go&quot; also enjoyed considerable crossover radio play and garnered Grammy nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for Williams. It was later covered by Robert Plant (best known as lead vocalist of Led Zeppelin) and Alison Krauss as a duet, released in 2021. Another song from the album, &quot;Still I Long for Your Kiss&quot;, was featured on the soundtrack album of the 1998 Robert Redford film &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot;. The track &quot;Lake Charles&quot; was later featured in the first episode of the HBO series &quot;True Blood&quot;, and was included on the first season&#x27;s soundtrack album. On February 20, 1999, Williams performed the tracks &quot;Can&#x27;t Let Go&quot; and &quot;2 Kool 2 Be 4-Gotten&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (episode &quot;Bill Murray/Lucinda Williams&quot;). Williams toured with Bob Dylan, the Allman Brothers and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and on her own in support of the album. An expanded edition of the album, including three additional studio recordings and a second CD documenting a 1998 concert, was released in 2006. In 1999, she appeared on &quot;Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons&quot;, duetting with David Crosby on the title track.

===2000–2003: &quot;Essence&quot; and &quot;World Without Tears&quot;===
Williams followed up the success of &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; with &quot;Essence&quot;, released on June 5, 2001. Featuring a less produced, more down-tuned approach both musically and lyrically, &quot;Essence&quot; moved Williams further from the country music establishment, while winning fans in the alternative music world. The album received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Album in 2002, while Williams won the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single &quot;Get Right With God&quot;, an atypically up-tempo gospel-rock tune from the otherwise rather low-key release. The title track includes a contribution on tremolo guitar by alternative country musician Ryan Adams, and earned Williams a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. At the same ceremony, Williams was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for her cover of &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot;, from the all-star Hank Williams tribute album, &quot;Timeless: Hank Williams Tribute&quot; (2001). On January 13, 2002, Williams performed with Elvis Costello on the inaugural episode of &quot;CMT Crossroads&quot;. Later that year, &quot;Time&quot; magazine christened Williams &quot;America&#x27;s best songwriter&quot;, and CMT ranked her No. 36 on its list of the 40 Greatest Women of Country Music.

Her seventh album, &quot;World Without Tears&quot;, was released on April 8, 2003. A musically adventurous though lyrically downbeat album, this release found Williams experimenting with talking blues stylings and electric blues. It received critical acclaim and was a commercial success, becoming Williams&#x27; first Top 20 album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 18. AllMusic called it &quot;the bravest, most emotionally wrenching record she&#x27;s ever issued&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Robert Hilburn deemed it &quot;a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll workout&quot;, writing that its edgiest songs sounded &quot;close to the raw, disoriented feel&quot; of the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1972 album &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;. &quot;World Without Tears&quot; earned Williams two Grammy nominations in 2004: Best Contemporary Folk Album, and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single &quot;Righteously&quot;. The previous year, Williams was nominated for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for her cover of Greg Brown&#x27;s &quot;Lately&quot;, from &quot;Going Driftless: An Artists&#x27; Tribute to Greg Brown&quot;.

===2004–2009: &quot;West&quot;, &quot;Little Honey&quot;, and continued success===
Williams was a guest vocalist on the song &quot;Factory Girls&quot; from Irish punk-folk band Flogging Molly&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Within a Mile of Home&quot;, and appeared on Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;The Delivery Man&quot; (2004). She sang with folk legend Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott on the track &quot;Careless Darling&quot; from his 2006 album &quot;I Stand Alone&quot;. In 2006, she recorded a version of the John Hartford classic &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot;, which played over the closing credits of the Will Ferrell film &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot;.

On February 13, 2007, Williams released her eighth album, &quot;West&quot;, for which she wrote more than 27 songs. It addresses her mother&#x27;s death and a tumultuous relationship break-up. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Are You Alright?&quot;, was ranked No. 34 on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007, while the third single, &quot;Come On&quot;, earned Williams two Grammy nominations: Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance and Best Rock Song. In the fall of 2007, Williams announced a series of shows in Los Angeles and New York. Playing five nights in each city, she performed her entire catalog on consecutive nights. These albums include the self-titled &quot;Lucinda Williams&quot; (1988), &quot;Sweet Old World&quot; (1992), &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; (1998), &quot;Essence&quot; (2001), and &quot;World Without Tears&quot; (2003). Each night also featured a second set with special guest stars, including Steve Earle, Allison Moorer, Mike Campbell, Greg Dulli, E, Ann Wilson, Emmylou Harris, David Byrne, David Johansen, Yo la Tengo, John Doe, Chuck Prophet, Jim Lauderdale and Shelby Lynne. Each night&#x27;s album set was recorded and made available to the attendees that night. These live recordings are currently available on her website and at her shows.

Williams wrapped recording on her ninth album in March 2008. Titled &quot;Little Honey&quot;, it was released on October 14 of that year and become her first Top 10 album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 9. &quot;Spin&quot; called it &quot;her finest record since &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot;,&quot; stating she &quot;goes back to the roots-rock well and takes a long, satisfying swig&quot;, while AllMusic called it &quot;the most polished and studied record she&#x27;s ever made&quot;. It earned Williams a Grammy nomination for Best Americana Album in 2010 (the first year to feature this category). The album includes 13 songs—among them, &quot;Real Love&quot; and &quot;Little Rock Star&quot;, the latter inspired by music celebrities in the press, like Pete Doherty and Amy Winehouse. It also includes a cover of AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot;, and &quot;Rarity&quot;, inspired by singer-songwriter Mia Doi Todd.

In July 2008, though &quot;Little Honey&quot; was yet to be released, &quot;Paste&quot; listened to an advance copy and ranked the duet between Williams and Elvis Costello on the song &quot;Jailhouse Tears&quot; as the No. 5 all-time greatest country/rock duet. Her 2008 concert appearance at the Catalyst in Santa Cruz contained an announcement by the city&#x27;s mayor that September 6, 2008, would henceforth be Lucinda Williams Day. In June 2008, she sang lead vocal  on M. Ward&#x27;s cover of &quot;Oh Lonesome Me&quot; for his &quot;Hold Time&quot; record (Merge Records).

===2010–2015: &quot;Blessed&quot; and &quot;Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone&quot;===
Williams released a cover of Shel Silverstein&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of Lucy Jordan&quot; in June 2010, as part of the &quot;Twistable, Turnable Man&quot; tribute album.
On March 1, 2011, Williams released her 10th studio album &quot;Blessed&quot;. Another critical and commercial success; the album debuted at No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Americana Album in 2012. It was also nominated for the Americana Award for Album of the Year. The track &quot;Kiss Like Your Kiss&quot; originally appeared in the HBO series &quot;True Blood&quot;, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media the previous year. AllMusic wrote &quot;&quot;Blessed&quot; is Williams&#x27; most focused recording since &quot;World Without Tears&quot;; it stands with it and her 1988 self-titled Rough Trade as one of her finest recordings to date. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;one of the best albums she&#x27;s ever released&quot;.

In July 2011, Williams&#x27; performance of her song &quot;Crescent City&quot; at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival was included in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Treme&quot; series 2 finale, episode 11; the characters comment that it was &quot;amazing she wrote this before the storm&quot;, referring to Hurricane Katrina. In September 2012, Williams was featured in a campaign called &quot;30 Songs / 30 Days&quot; to support &quot;Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide&quot;, a multi-platform media project inspired by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn&#x27;s book. In 2012 and 2013, Williams toured the U.S. accompanied only by guitarist Doug Pettibone.

On September 30, 2014, Williams released her 11th studio album, &quot;Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone&quot;, and performed the track &quot;Protection&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;. The first album on her Highway 20 Records label, &quot;Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone&quot; was met with critical acclaim, and debuted at No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It won the Americana Music Award for Album of the Year in 2015, while the track &quot;East Side of Town&quot; was nominated for Song of the Year. That same year, she provided backup vocals for the Don Henley song &quot;Train in the Distance&quot; on his album &quot;Cass County.&quot;

===2015–2019: &quot;The Ghosts of Highway 20&quot;, &quot;This Sweet Old World&quot;, and &quot;Vanished Gardens&quot;===
On February 5, 2016, Williams released her 12th studio album, &quot;The Ghosts of Highway 20&quot;, and performed the track &quot;Dust&quot; on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; on February 17, 2016. AllMusic wrote &quot;after releasing one of the best and boldest albums of her career with &quot;Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone&quot;, Williams goes from strength to strength with &quot;The Ghosts of Highway 20&quot;, and it seems like a welcome surprise that she&#x27;s moving into one of the most fruitful periods of her recording career as she approaches her fourth decade as a musician&quot;. The album debuted at No. 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was nominated for the Americana Music Award for Album of the Year.

On May 13, 2017, Williams was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music Degree from Berklee College of Music during the 2017 Commencement Concert. In June, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Williams one of the 100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time. On September 29, 2017, she released &quot;This Sweet Old World&quot;, a re-recorded and expanded version her 1992 album, &quot;Sweet Old World&quot;. Writing for &quot;Exclaim!&quot;, Mark Dunn gave the album seven out of 10, agreeing that Williams&#x27; voice has changed dramatically in the ensuing 25 years but noting that she uses it as an instrument masterfully, pairing it with stripped-down country arrangements, compared to the more pop feel of the 1992 release. George de Stefano of PopMatters gave the release nine stars out of ten, calling it a &quot;surprising and bold move&quot; and writes that both the re-recordings and the new tracks are &quot;gems&quot;.

On June 29, 2018, Blue Note Records released &quot;Vanished Gardens&quot;, a collaborative album by Charles Lloyd &amp; the Marvels and Williams, who performed on five tracks, including &quot;Dust&quot; from &quot;The Ghosts of Highway 20&quot;, &quot;Ventura&quot; from &quot;World Without Tears&quot;, and &quot;Unsuffer Me&quot; from &quot;West&quot;. Marvels members Bill Frisell and Greg Leisz had previously worked with Williams, including on her 1998 album &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot;. The album was met with critical acclaim; AllMusic wrote &quot;the pairing of this band with Williams sounds natural, effortless, and holistic&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it a &quot;savvy stylistic blend&quot;.

In 2019, Williams produced New York City singer-songwriter Jesse Malin&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Sunset Kids&quot;, which was met with widespread critical acclaim. She co-wrote three tracks on the album, and performed on three tracks.

===2020–2021: &quot;Good Souls Better Angels&quot; and &quot;Lu&#x27;s Jukebox&quot;===
On February 4, 2020, Williams announced her album &quot;Good Souls Better Angels&quot; would be released on April 23. In the same &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article, Williams released the first single from the album, &quot;Man Without a Soul&quot;, which strongly alluded to then-President Donald Trump. Jon Breen of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; gave the release five out of five stars, writing that it &quot;punch[es] with a dark, almost biblical vengeance but also, importantly, balance vitriol with solace, hellfire with a hand in need&quot; and praising its timely lyrics. In &quot;American Songwriter&quot;, Hal Horowitz gave the release 4.5 out of five stars, writing that it is arguably her most intense album, ending his review: &quot;By the end of the hour, you&#x27;ll be wiped out. This is a devastatingly in your face, take no prisoners presentation from Williams and her band that will leave most serious listeners shattered and perhaps shaking. Few albums connect with this much pure emotional fury, let alone those from artists well into their 60s.&quot;

At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;Good Souls Better Angels&quot; received a nomination for Best Americana Album and songwriters Williams and Tom Overby received a nomination in the Best American Roots Song category for &quot;Man Without a Soul&quot;. The album also made several critics&#x27; best-of-the-year lists, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which placed it at No. 47, while &quot;Mojo&quot; ranked it No. 38 on their list. In their alphabetical list, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named it one of the 35 Best Rock Albums of 2020.

On March 19, 2020, Williams released a song she wrote for the Netflix movie &quot;Lost Girls&quot;, titled &quot;Lost Girl&quot;. Later that year, Williams began &quot;Lu&#x27;s Jukebox&quot;, a six-episode series of themed live performances.

Williams was inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame in October 2021. Jason Isbell, who inducted Williams, credited her with creating a map for other singer-songwriters to follow; &quot;A lot of my songs wouldn&#x27;t exist if I hadn&#x27;t spent so much time trying to rip her off&quot;, he stated in his speech. Isbell also performed Williams&#x27; &quot;I Envy the Wind&quot; from her 2002 album &quot;Essence&quot;. Williams also performed at the ceremony, she sang &quot;Crescent City&quot; with Rosanne Cash and &quot;Changed the Locks&quot; with Margo Price. Later that year, she appeared on the Robert Plant and Alison Krauss album &quot;Raise the Roof&quot; as a backing vocalist.

===2022–present: Honorary accolades and &quot;Stories from a Rock n Roll Heart&quot;===

On November 17, 2021, it was announced that Williams would receive the Americana Music Association-UK International Lifetime Achievement Award in January 2022. The ceremony was held on January 27, 2022. On September 12, 2022, Williams was the recipient of the BMI Troubadour Award. The award celebrates songwriters who have made a lasting impact on their community and who &quot;craft for the sake of the song, setting the pace for generations of songwriters who will follow.&quot; Past recipients include John Hiatt, John Prine, and Robert Earl Keen.

On February 4, 2023, Williams was honored with the AMERICANAFEST Pre-Grammy Salute to Lucinda Williams, which was held at the Troubadour and live-streamed on Mandolin.com.

On April 4, 2023, Williams announced that her 15th studio album, &quot;Stories from a Rock n Roll Heart&quot;, would be released on June 30, 2023. The lead single &quot;New York Comeback&quot; was released simultaneously with the album announcement.

It was announced on October 7, 2024, that the seventh volume in &quot;Lu&#x27;s Jukebox&quot; series, &quot;Lucinda Williams sings the Beatles from Abbey Road&quot;, would be released on December 6, 2024. Recorded in the same London studio where the Beatles recorded their 1969 album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, the announcement was accompanied by the release of the single &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. A reviewer in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine said that in covering the Beatles&#x27; music on this album, Williams was one of few who successfully [honored] &quot;the source material, making it uniquely [her] own, and creating something worth hearing&quot;.

==Backing bands==
From 1985 to 1996, Williams&#x27; band included guitarist Gurf Morlix.

From before 2012 into 2022, Williams has called her backing band the Buick 6, whose name was inspired by Bob Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;From a Buick 6&quot;. Since 2012, Buick 6 has been Butch Norton, drums, who joined Williams in 2007; Stuart Mathis, guitar; and David Sutton, bass. Buick 6 has occasionally performed and recorded separately from Williams. For Williams&#x27; 2022 tours, Jim Oblon joined on guitar and keyboards.

==Personal life==
In 1986, Williams married Long Ryders drummer Greg Sowders, but the couple divorced within eighteen months. In September 2009 she married Tom Overby, an executive from Best Buy&#x27;s music department, who is also her manager. The marriage ceremony was performed on stage at the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue by her father.

On November 17, 2020, Williams had a stroke in her home in Nashville. Doctors discovered a blood clot, and she was discharged five weeks later. Though at the time she needed to walk with a cane and could not play guitar, she subsequently recovered enough for her summer 2021 tour with Jason Isbell.

In 2023, Williams released her autobiography titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Anyone the Secrets I Told You: A Memoir&quot;. The book details her traumatic childhood, her relationships with her father and mother, and her struggle to forge a sustainable career in the music industry.

<text>Macedonius II of Constantinople (Greek: Μακεδόνιος; died 517) was patriarch of Constantinople (496–511).

== Biography ==
Within a year or two (the date is uncertain) he assembled a council, in which he confirmed in writing the acts of the Council of Chalcedon. In 507 Elias I of Jerusalem, patriarch of Jerusalem, who had been unwilling to sanction the deposition of Euphemius of Constantinople, united himself in communion with Macedonius. The emperor Anastasius I Dicorus employed all means to oblige Macedonius to declare against the Council of Chalcedon, but flattery and threats were alike unavailing. An assassin named Eucolus was even hired to take away his life. The patriarch avoided the blow and ordered a fixed amount of provisions to be given monthly to the criminal. The people of Constantinople were equally zealous for the council of Chalcedon, even, more than once, to the point of sedition. To prevent unfavourable consequences, Anastasius I ordered the prefect of the city to follow in the processions and attend the assemblies of the church.

In 510 Anastasius I made a new effort. Macedonius II would do nothing without an ecumenical council at which the bishop of Rome should preside. Anastasius I, annoyed at this answer and irritated because Macedonius would never release him from the engagement he had made at his coronation to maintain the faith of the Church and the authority of the council of Chalcedon, sought to drive him from his chair. He sent Eutychian monks and clergy, and sometimes the magistrates of the city, to load him with public outrage and insult. This caused such a tumult amongst the citizens that the emperor was obliged to shut himself up in his palace and to have ships prepared in case flight should be necessary. He sent to Macedonius, asking him to come and speak with him. Macedonius II went and reproached him with the sufferings his persecutions caused the Church. Anastasius I stated his willingness to this, but at the same time made a third attempt to tamper with the beliefs of the patriarch.

One of his instruments was Philoxenus of Mabbug, a Eutychian bishop. He demanded of Macedonius II a declaration of his faith in writing; Macedonius addressed a memorandum to the emperor insisting that he knew no other faith than that of the Fathers of Nicaea and Constantinople and that he anathematised Nestorius and Eutyches and those who admitted two Sons or two Christs, or who divided the two natures. Philoxenus of Mabbug, seeing the failure of his first attempt, found two individuals who accused Macedonius of an abominable crime, avowing themselves his accomplices. They then charged him with Nestorianism, and with having falsified a passage in an epistle of Paul of Tarsus, in support of that sect. At last, the emperor commanded him to send by master of the offices the authentic copy of the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon signed with the autographs of the bishops. Macedonius II refused and hid it under the altar of the great church. Thereupon Anastasius II had him carried off by night and taken to Chalcedon, to be conducted thence to Eucaïta in Pontus, the place of the exile of his predecessor. In 515 Pope Hormisdas worked for the restitution of Macedonius II, whom he considered unjustly deposed; it had been a stipulation in the treaty of peace between the rebel consul Vitalian, a relative of Macedonius, and Emperor Anastasius that the patriarch and all the deposed bishops should be restored to their sees. But Anastasius never kept his promises, and Macedonius II died in exile. His death occurred c. 517, at Gangra, where he had retired for fear of the Huns, who ravaged all Cappadocia, Galatia, and Pontus.

<doc id="273381" wikidata="Q1520311" url="?curid=273381" title="Violent crime">
<text>A violent crime, violent felony, crime of violence or crime of a violent nature is a crime in which an offender or perpetrator uses or threatens to use harmful force upon a victim. This entails both crimes in which the violent act is the objective, such as murder, assault, rape and assassination, as well as crimes in which violence is used as a method of coercion or show of force, such as robbery, extortion and terrorism. Violent crimes may, or may not, be committed with weapons. Depending on the jurisdiction, violent crimes may be regarded with varying severities from homicide to harassment. 

Violent criminals who use hostile acts towards others include murderers, active shooters, robbers, kidnappers, rapists, burglars, muggers and torturers. Another category of violent criminals are pirates and hijackers of cars or aircraft. Criminal organizations, gangsters and drug cartels frequently employ violent criminals in their group, usually as enforcers or hitmen. Violent criminals often display characteristics such as low anger threshold, disinhibition/absence of impulsivity control, strong dominance/territorial instinct, antisocial personality, psychological/mental health issues and aggressive tendencies which enable them to carry out usually violent acts.

==Violent crime by country==

The comparison of violent crime statistics between countries is usually problematic, due to the way different countries classify crime. Valid comparisons require that similar offences between jurisdictions be compared. Often this is not possible, because crime statistics aggregate equivalent offences in such different ways that make it difficult or impossible to obtain a valid comparison. Depending on the jurisdiction, violent crimes may include: homicide, murder, assault, manslaughter, sexual assault, rape, robbery, negligence, endangerment, kidnapping (abduction), extortion, and harassment. Different countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Europe, and the United States all have different systems of recording and reporting crimes.

===Australia===
The International Crime Victimization Survey (ICVS) is one way Australia analyzes crime. This way is done separately from formal police reporting and allows the citizens of Australia to express their experience of crime that otherwise would not have been reported to the police. It is similar to the NCVS which is a survey that the United States does to estimate non-reported crime. The two major categories of the ICVS are personal crime and household crime.

The first annual national survey of crime victimization in Australia, the Crime Victimisation Survey, was conducted in 2008–09. Personal crimes included in the survey are: 

*Physical assault
*Threatened assault (including face-to-face and non face-to-face)
*Robbery (including attempted)
*Sexual assault (including attempted) 
One type of sexual offense is Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). Intimate Partner Violence often stems from other violent tendencies/ behavior such as anger, lack of self-control and/or mental instability. There is a gender gap that is notable when it comes to Intimate Partner Violence. Men are more likely to be guilty of general violence while women are more likely to be guilty of IPV. Lack of self-control in men has a direct correlation on whether they are guilty of IPV or not, while anger is more correlated to women on whether they engage in this type of behavior or not.

Household Crimes that often lead to violent crime include burglary and attempted burglary. Rates for household crimes were higher than personal crimes and this rate is calculated based on every 100 people per 100 households.

Australia (as well as New Zealand) classifies crime according to the Australian and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification (ANZSOC). Originally released in 1997 as the Australian Standard Offence Classification (ASOC), it was revised in 2008 and renamed in 2011 to reflect the international use of the standard in both countries and follows an agreed policy to harmonise classifications between the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and Statistics New Zealand. The standard has no single category for violent crime, but its first six divisions involve offences committed against the person: 
:01 Homicide and related offences;
:02 Acts intended to cause injury;
:03 Sexual assault and related offences;
:04 Dangerous or negligent acts endangering persons;
:05 Abduction, harassment, and other offences against the person;
:06 Robbery, extortion, and related offences.

===Canada===
Canada conducts an annual measure of crime incidence called the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR). UCR &quot;Violent &quot;Criminal Code&quot;&quot; violations include: homicide, attempted murder, sexual assault, assault, robbery, criminal harassment, uttering threats, and other violent violations. Canada also collects information on crime victimization every five years via its General Social Survey on Victimisation (GSS). Among the eight GSS crimes tracked are three violent crimes: sexual assault, robbery, and physical assault.

===New Zealand===
Before the country adopted the Australian standard for classifying offences (ASOC) in 2010, New Zealand&#x27;s crime statistics had a category for violence that included homicides, kidnapping, abduction, robbery, assaults, intimidation, threats, and group assembly, while all sexual offences were shown in a separate category from violence. Violent crime is not specifically defined New Zealand legislation, with the Crimes Act 1961 instead having separate legislation that deal with &quot;Crimes against morality and decency, sexual crimes, crimes against public welfare&quot; and &quot;Crimes against the person&quot;. In 2015, New Zealand Police changed the way it counted crime from counting recorded offences, to counting people victimised or those found to be offending. The rationale behind the change was that instead of just simply recording the offense, analyzing who exactly is the victim and who exactly is the offender can be more helpful in understanding the nature of the violent crime along with pointing out any trends/patterns. Historic recorded offence statistics from 1994 to 2014 are available from Statistics NZ, while more recent statistics are available from New Zealand Police via &quot;policedata.nz&quot;. While violent crime is not defined in New Zealand Law, the first 6 divisions of the classification standard do define offences against the person.

===Europe===
Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, England, Latvia, Netherlands, Portugal, Greece and Sweden count minor violence such as slapping another person as assault. An example is the case of Ilias Kasidiaris in 2012. Kasidaris, then spokesperson for Greece&#x27;s far-right Golden Dawn party, slapped a left-wing female opponent in the face during a live televised debate. He was subsequently wanted by Greek prosecutors for assault and faced an arrest warrant.

France does not count minor violence like slapping somebody as assault.

The United Kingdom includes all violence against the person including sexual offences, as violent crime. Today, violent crimes are considered the most heinous whereas historically, according to Simon Dedo, crimes against property were equally important. Rates of violent crime in the UK are recorded by the British Crime Survey. Statistics from the 2010/2011 report on crime in England and Wales showed that violent crime continues a general downward trend observed over the last few decades. &quot;The 2010/11 BCS showed overall violence was down 47 percent on the level seen at its peak in 1995; representing nearly two million fewer violent offences per year.&quot; In 2010/11, 31 people per 1,000 interviewed reported being a victim of violent crime in the 12 preceding months. Regarding murder, &quot;increasing levels of homicide (at around 2% to 3% per year) [have been observed] from the 1960s through to the end of the twentieth century&quot;. Recently the murder rate has declined, &quot;a fall of 19 percent in homicides since 2001/02&quot;, as measured by The Homicide Index.

===United States===


The U.S. federal government&#x27;s definition of a &quot;crime of violence&quot; is stated at Title 18 of the United States Code Chapter 1 § 16: There are two main crime databases maintained by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ): the Bureau of Justice Statistics&#x27; National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s Uniform Crime Report (UCR). Non-fatal violence is reported in the NCVS, which measures rape and sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated and simple assault reported by households surveyed by the U.S. Census Bureau. The UCR tracks similar non-fatal violence, plus murder and non-negligent manslaughter recorded by law enforcement.

There are significant methodological and definitional differences between the NCVS and UCR:
*The NCVS includes estimates of both reported and unreported crimes, while the UCR collects data on crimes recorded by the police.
*The UCR includes homicide, arson, and commercial crimes, while the NCVS does not.
*The UCR excludes simple assault (attacks or attempted attacks without a weapon resulting in either no injury or minor injury) and sexual assault, which are in the NCVS.
*The NCVS data are estimates from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households, but the UCR data are based on the actual counts of offenses reported by law enforcement.
The NCVS excludes crimes against children under 12 years, persons in institutions, and, possibly, highly mobile populations and the homeless; however, victimizations against these persons may be included in the UCR. Since they use different methodologies and measure overlapping, but not identical, crimes, the data are complementary and not necessarily congruent.

UCR and FBI

In 2019, The FBI&#x27;s data reports that there were approximately 1,203,808 Violent Crimes that occurred in the United States. Compared to statistics from last year, robbery, rape, and burglary offenses saw a decrease in rates while assault and murder saw a slight increase. Per 100,000 people living in the United States, 156 arrests were made that related to violent crime in some capacity. More specifically, for every 100,000 people, 3 arrests were made for murder, 7 for rape, 24 for robbery, and assault was the most common with 120 arrests made for every 100,000 people.

Bureau of Justice Statistics and NCVS

In 2019, The NCVS data collected consisted of 155,076 households across the United States. A notable statistic from this data collection is the rate of violent crime dropping 15% in 2019. Per 1,000 individuals interviewed, 7.3 people were said to be victims of a violent crime which is a decrease compared to 2018 (8.6 per every 1,000 people). Being a victim of a violent crime as it relates to race decreased as well. Black people saw a decrease of 29% while white people saw a decrease of 22%.

Violent crime in both the UCR and NCVS categories have a common variable: alcohol consumption. About 25% of American women have been victims of sexual assault while about 20% of American men have been the ones to commit this sexual assault and other violent behavior, which shows a clear gender gap. Women are disproportionately more likely to be victims of these categories in the United States. Alcohol is known to impair judgement which results in irrational decisions being made. The UCR rates for forcible rape are so low because women are unlikely to report being a victim of this violent behavior.

In 2011, the UCR violent crime rate had dropped to 386.3 cases per 100,000 persons, compared to 729.6 per 100,000 in 1990.

U.S. homicide data is also available in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS).

Socioeconomic Status and Crime Rates

Socioeconomic status plays an influential role in levels of violent crime, there is a direct correlation between poverty and increased violence in deprived areas of the United States. People living in poverty are more likely to turn to violent crime as a means to provide for their family if they feel that the legal means of doing so are insufficient. Poverty can promote a Darwinian &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; approach where personal prosperity is prioritised over the lives of others, leading to an increased tolerance for committing violent crime.

<text>John of Cappadocia, surnamed &quot;Cappadox&quot; or &quot;the Cappadocian&quot; (Greek: Ἰωάννης ὁ Καππαδόκης; died February 520), was patriarch of Constantinople in 518–520, during the reign of Byzantine emperor Anastasius I Dicorus after an enforced condemnation of the Council of Chalcedon. His short patriarchate is memorable for the celebrated Acclamations of Constantinople, and the reunion of East and West after a schism of 34 years. At the death of Timothy I of Constantinople, John of Cappadocia, whom he had designated his successor, was presbyter and chancellor of the Church of Constantinople.

== Biography ==
On 9 July 518, the long reign of Anastasius I Dicorus came to a close, the orthodox Justin I succeeding. On 15 July, the new emperor entered the cathedral, and the patriarch, accompanied by twelve prelates, was making his way through the throngs that crowded every corner. As he came near the raised dais where the pulpit stood shouts arose, &quot;Long live the patriarch! Long live the emperor! Why do we remain excommunicated? Why have we not communicated these many years? You are Catholic, what do you fear; worthy servant of the Trinity? Cast out Severus the Manichee! O Justin, our emperor, you win! This instant proclaim the synod of Chalcedon, because Justin reigns&quot;. These and other cries continued. The procession passed into the inclosure, but the excited congregation went on shouting outside the gates of the choir in similar strains: &quot;You shall not come out unless you anathematise Severus&quot;, referring to the heretical patriarch of Antioch. The patriarch John, having meanwhile gained time for thought and consultation, came out and mounted the pulpit, saying, &quot;There is no need of disturbance or tumult; nothing has been done against the faith; we recognise for orthodox all the councils which have confirmed the decrees of Nicaea, and principally these three - First Council of Constantinople, First Council of Ephesus, and the great Council of Chalcedon&quot;.

The people were determined to have a more formal decision, and continued shouting for several hours, mingling with their former cries such as these: &quot;Fix a day for a festival in honour of Chalcedon!&quot; &quot;Commemorate the holy synod this very morrow!&quot;. The people being thus firm, the deacon Samuel was instructed to announce the desired festival. Still the people continued to shout with all their might, &quot;Severus is now to be anathematised; anathematise him this instant, or there&#x27;s nothing done!&quot;. The patriarch, seeing that something must be settled, took counsel with the twelve attendant prelates, who agreed to the curse on Severus. This extemporaneous and intimidated council then carried a decree by acclamation: &quot;It is plain to all that Severus in separating himself from this church condemned himself. Following, therefore, the canons and the Fathers, we hold him alien and condemned by reason of his blasphemies, and we anathematise him&quot;. The domes of St. Sophia rang with shouts of triumph and the crowd dispersed. It was a day long remembered in Constantinople.

The next day the promised commemoration of Chalcedon took place. Again as the patriarch made his processional entrance and approached the pulpit clamours arose: &quot;Restore the relics of Macedonius II of Constantinople to the church! Restore those exiled for the faith! Let the bones of the Nestorians be dug up! Let the bones of the Eutychians be dug up! Cast out the Manichees! Place the four councils in the diptychs! Place Pope Leo I, bishop of Rome, in the diptychs! Bring the diptychs to the pulpit!&quot;. This kind of cry continuing, the patriarch replied, &quot;Yesterday we did what was enough to satisfy my dear people, and we shall do the same to-day. We must take the faith as our inviolable foundation; it will aid us to reunite the churches. Let us then glorify with one mouth the holy and consubstantial Trinity&quot;. But the people went on crying madly, &quot;This instant, let none go out! I abjure you, shut the doors! You no longer fear Amantius the Manichee! Justin reigns, why fear Amantius?&quot;. So they continued. The patriarch tried in vain to bring them to reason. It was the outburst of enthusiasm and excitement long pent up under heterodox repression. It bore all before it. The patriarch was at last obliged to have inserted in the diptychs the four councils of First Council of Nicaea, Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon, and the names of Euphemius of Constantinople and Macedonius II, patriarchs of Constantinople, and Leo I, bishop of Rome. Then the multitude chanted for more than an hour, &quot;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He hath visited and redeemed His people!&quot;. The choir assembled on the raised platform, and, turning eastwards, sang the Trisagion, the whole people listening in silence. When the moment arrived for the recitation of the names of the defunct bishops from the diptychs, the multitude closed in silence about the holy table; and when the deacon had read the new insertions, a mighty shout arose, &quot;Glory be to Thee, O Lord!&quot;.

To authenticate what had been done, John assembled on 20 July a council of 40 bishops, who happened to be at the capital. The four general councils and the name of Pope Leo I were inscribed in the diptychs. Severus of Antioch was anathematised after an examination of his works in which a distinct condemnation of Chalcedon was discovered. John wrote to John III (bishop of Jerusalem) and to Epiphanius of Tyre, telling them the good news of the acclamations and the synod. His letters were accompanied by orders from Justin to restore all who had been banished by Anastasius and to inscribe the Council of Chalcedon in the diptychs. At Jerusalem and at Tyre there was great joy. Many other churches declared for Chalcedon, and during the reign of Justin, 2500 bishops gave their adhesion and approval. Now came the reconciliation with Rome. The emperor Justin wrote to the pope a fortnight after the scene of the acclamations, begging him to further the desires of the patriarch John for the reunion of the churches. John wrote saying that he received the four general councils and that the names of Leo and of Hormisdas himself had been put in the diptychs. A deputation was sent to Constantinople with instructions that Acacius was to be anathematised by name, but that Euphemius and Macedonius II might be passed over in silence.

The deputies arrived at Constantinople on 25 March 519. Justin received the pope&#x27;s letters with great respect, and told the ambassadors to come to an explanation with the patriarch, who at first wished to express his adherence in the form of a letter, but agreed to write a little preface and place after it the words of Hormisdas, which he copied out in his own handwriting. Two copies were sent by the legates to Rome, one in Greek, the other in Latin. Emperor, senate, and all present were overjoyed at this ratification of peace.

The sting of the transaction still remained; they had now to efface from the diptychs the names of five patriarchs - patriarch Acacius of Constantinople, patriarch Fravitta of Constantinople, patriarch Euphemius of Constantinople, patriarch Macedonius II of Constantinople, and patriarch Timothy I of Constantinople - and two emperors - Zeno and Anastasius I. All the bishops at Constantinople gave their consent in writing; so did all the abbots, after some discussion. On Easter Day the pacification was promulgated. The court and people, equally enthusiastic, surged into Saint Sophia. The vaults resounded with acclamations in praise of God, the emperor, Saint Peter, and the Pope of Rome. Opponents, who had prophesied sedition and tumult, were signally disappointed. Never within memory had so vast a number communicated. The emperor sent an account of the proceedings throughout the provinces and the ambassadors forwarded their report to Rome, saying that there only remained the negotiations with the Patriarch of Antioch. John wrote to Pope Hormisdas to congratulate him on the great work, and to offer him the credit of its success. Soon after, on 19 January 520, John died.

<doc id="273403" wikidata="Q16862" url="?curid=273403" title="RM-81 Agena">
<text>The RM-81 Agena () was an American rocket upper stage and satellite bus which was developed by Lockheed Corporation initially for the canceled WS-117L reconnaissance satellite program. Following the division of WS-117L into SAMOS and Corona for image intelligence, and MIDAS for early warning, the Agena was later used as an upper stage, and an integrated component, for several programs, including Corona reconnaissance satellites and the Agena Target Vehicle used to demonstrate rendezvous and docking during Project Gemini. It was used as an upper stage on the Atlas, Thor, Thorad and Titan IIIB rockets, and considered for others including the Space Shuttle and Atlas V. A total of 365 Agena rockets were launched between February 28, 1959 and February 1987. Only 33 Agenas carried NASA payloads and the vast majority were for DoD programs.

On some missions, the payload was built directly into the Agena, which provided it with electric power, communications and three-axis stabilization. Payload components were usually located ahead of the Agena&#x27;s standard bulkhead. On missions where the payload was not built into the Agena, and instead separated after launch, the Agena was known as an &quot;Ascent Agena&quot;. The Agena was upgraded twice from the original Agena A in order to support heavier and more sophisticated satellites, such as Corona spacecraft with multiple and more powerful cameras.

The Agena name was suggested by the Department of Defense&#x27;s Advanced Research Projects Agency for the star Beta Centauri, also known as Agena, because this upper stage would &quot;ignite in the sky&quot;. This followed Lockheed&#x27;s tradition of naming products for stellar phenomena.

The final launch was of an Agena D on February 12, 1987, configured as the upper stage of a Titan 34B. In all, 365 Agena vehicles were launched by NASA and the US Air Force.

== Characteristics ==
The Agena was 5.0 feet (1.5 m) in diameter, three-axis stabilized (for the benefit of the reconnaissance system cameras) and its Bell Aircraft XLR81 engine produced 16,000 lbs (71 kN) of thrust using unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) as the fuel, and inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA) as the oxidizer. First versions used Type IIIA IRFNA with 14% of nitrogen dioxide, while later versions switched to Type IV High Density Acid (HDA) with 44% of nitrogen dioxide. HDA is more corrosive, but has higher density and increased performance. This is a hypergolic fuel/oxidizer combination, and as such, it does not need an ignition system. This rocket engine could be restarted multiple times in orbit, by radio command, and it frequently was. The engine was notable for its unusual aluminum construction. The regeneratively-cooled channels that cooled the throat and nozzle were formed from straight gun drill formed channels. The parabolic shape of the chamber throat made for a difficult gun-drilling problem, which Bell Aerosystems engineers solved by arranging the cooling channels in a &quot;One-Sheeted Circular Hyperboloid&quot; shape, allowing machinists to gun-drill straight cooling channels through the curved surfaces of the combustion chamber. The engine was derived from the XLR-81 propulsion unit for the canceled rocket-propelled nuclear warhead pod of the Convair B-58 Hustler bomber. Until 1959, the Agena was also known as the Discoverer Vehicle or Bell Hustler.

Attitude control of the horizontal flying Agena was provided by an inertial reference package with three gyroscopes, two horizon sensors, and cold-gas thrusters using a nitrogen-freon mixture. Pitch and roll were sensed by two hermetic integrating gyro units. A rate gyro unit determined yaw error by sensing orbital rate. Pitch and roll gyro errors were corrected from the horizon sensors, which were later supplemented by Sun and star trackers. This enabled the Agena to accommodate the higher pointing stability required for better ground resolution imaging with the improved Corona cameras.

As the Agena was designed to hold a fixed orientation in space while orbiting Earth, a passive thermal control system was devised.

The main source of the Agena&#x27;s electrical power was silver peroxide-zinc batteries, which from the early 1960s on were supplemented by solar arrays. An S-band transponder enabled the Agena to receive ground command sequences (image motion compensation, altered attitude, etc.), which could be stored for later execution.

== Versions ==
Three versions of the Agena were flown:
===Agena-A===

The Agena-A was the first type of Agena to be built. It was launched atop Thor and Atlas rockets, mostly into polar orbits from Vandenberg Air Force Base Launch Complex 75 and Point Arguello Launch Complex 1 respectively. Two Atlas launches occurred from Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral. 

The Agena-A was propelled by a Bell 8048 (XLR-81-BA-5) engine, which could produce 69 kN (about 15,500 lbs) of thrust with a burn time of 120 seconds. 

Twenty Agena-As were launched between 1959 and 1961, all of them for the Discoverer, MIDAS, and Samos programs.

===Agena-B===

During 1960, Lockheed introduced the improved Agena-B, which could be restarted in orbit and had longer propellant tanks for increased burn time. It was launched atop Thor and Atlas rockets.

It was equipped with a Bell 8081 engine, which could generate 71 kN of thrust with a burn time of 240 seconds, and be restarted in orbit. 

These launched the SAMOS-E, SAMOS-F (ELINT Ferret), and MIDAS (Missile Defense Alarm System) military early-warning satellites, Ranger lunar probes, Mariner planetary probes, OGO, and Nimbus satellites. Agena-B&#x27;s first flight was the (unsuccessful) launch of Discoverer 16 on October 26, 1960. The Agena-B took months to be ready for Atlas launches and did not fly on that booster until Midas 3 on July 12, 1961. The final Agena-B flight was the launch of OGO 3 on June 7, 1966. A total of 76 were launched.

===Agena-D===

The Agena D was the result of a proposal by Lockheed engineering executive Lawrence Edwards, who suggested standardizing the basic Agena configuration (up to this point, each Agena was custom-built for both the payload and the launch vehicle it was used with), and adding additional features depending on payload requirements, and a requirement from the Pentagon that the Agena be made compatible with the Titan rocket. This proposal originated in late 1962 when mounting frustration over the high failure rate of Thor and Atlas-Agena prompted the suggestion that greater standardization of launch vehicles would improve reliability. David N. Spires summarizes the standardization as follows:
Its orbital configuration had a diameter of and a length of , and provided 19,500 Wh of electrical power from batteries. As of 2014, the Agena-D is the most-launched US upper stage. A special production line was set up to turn out 40 Agena-D spacecraft per year. Edwards remained responsible for the engineering for several years, until the Air Force declared the Agena-D as operational and froze its design. By the time of its retirement, the reliability of the Agena-D exceeded 95 percent. 

It was launched atop Atlas, Thor, Thorad and Titan IIIB rockets. It was equipped with a Bell 8096 engine, which could generate 71 kN of thrust with a burn time of 265 seconds. 

The first Agena-D launch was of KH-4 #7 on June 28, 1963, and a total of 269 Agena-Ds were launched. The Agena-D was used to launch KH-7 GAMBIT and KH-8 Gambit 3 reconnaissance satellites, three Mariner probes to Venus and the two Mariner space probes to Mars. 

Thor-Agena flew for the last time in 1972 when it launched a KH-4B satellite. The last Atlas-Agena used an Agena D stage atop a refurbished Atlas F missile to launch Seasat in 1978. Twelve more Agenas were launched on Titan vehicles through 1987 before the stage was completely retired.

The final Agena-D upper stage was launched on a Titan IIIB rocket on February 12, 1987, carrying USA-21, the last SDS-1 satellite.

====Agena Target Vehicle====
The Agena Target Vehicle was based around the Agena-D, with equipment fitted to support use as a rendezvous and docking target for missions conducted as part of Project Gemini. It was equipped with a Bell Aerospace Model 8247 engine, which was qualified for up to 15 restarts. On later missions, the Agena&#x27;s engine was fired while the Gemini spacecraft was docked, in order to boost the spacecraft to a higher orbit, and to bring it back again. During the Gemini 11 mission, an elliptical orbit with an apogee of was reached, which set an altitude record for crewed spaceflight that held until Apollo 8, the first crewed mission to the Moon, exceeded it.

===Other variants===

In the early 1970s Lockheed studied the use of Agena as a payload booster in the Space Shuttle payload bay.
An Agena-C with an increased diameter was proposed, but never built.

The Agena-2000 was intended as a modernized Agena, and would have been used on the Atlas V Light Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle. The Atlas V Light was cancelled in favor of standardizing the Medium configuration, and as a result the Agena-2000 was never built.

== Launches ==
The first launch of an Agena-D was Agena Flight #64 on 27 June 1962. By the end of 1967, a total of 162 Agena-D had been launched:

==Debris==
Since many of the Agenas have remained in orbit long after they were needed, they&#x27;ve had time to break-up resulting in more orbital debris. They are thought to have exploded due to residual propellant igniting.

<text>Nicholas Rémy, Latin Remigius (1530–1616) was a French magistrate who claimed in his book to have overseen the execution of more than 800 witches and the torture or persecution of a similar number. His work shows much influence from Jean Bodin.

==Early life==
After studying law at the University of Toulouse, Remy practised in Paris from 1563 to 1570. In 1570, his uncle retired as Lieutenant General of Vosges and Remy was appointed to the post; in 1575 he was appointed secretary to Duke Charles III of Lorraine.

==Publications==
Remy wrote a number of poems and several books on history, but is known for his &quot;Daemonolatreiae libri tres&quot; (&quot;Demonolatry&quot;), written in Latin and published in Lyon in 1595. The book was reprinted several times, translated into German, and eventually replaced the Malleus Maleficarum as the most recognized handbook of witch-hunters in parts of Europe.

According to Remy, the Devil could appear before people in the shape of a black cat or man, and liked Black Masses. Demons could also have sexual relationships with women and, in case they did not agree, rape them.

==Career==
He was of the Catholic faith, and wrote his Latin works with the blessings of the Church, but was not himself a priest and married at least once (possibly twice), fathering quite a few children. One of them, a favored son, was supposedly killed in a street accident at the beginning of Remy&#x27;s judicial career after being cursed by an old beggar woman when Remy refused to give her any money. This incident in 1582 was the start of Remy&#x27;s career as a witch-hunter. He successfully prosecuted the beggar for bewitching his son and had the woman put to death.

Finding witches was very personal business for Remy. An extremely educated man for his day, he seemed to have utterly believed in what he was doing. Remy personally sentenced 900 people to death between 1581 and 1591. In 1592, Remy retired and moved to the country to escape the bubonic plague. There he compiled notes from his ten-year campaign against witchcraft into the &quot;Demonolatry&quot;.

==Claims 800 executed and a revision==
Remy brags that during a mere 16-year period when he worked as a judge in Lorraine, not less than 800 persons (&quot;non minus octingentos&quot;) were condemned at the stake for &quot;sortilegis crimen&quot; or the crime of witchcraft (sorcery seems to derive from the Latin &quot;sortilegus&quot;), which certain witch-phobic Christians of this time period considered to a real supernatural power that was sourced from the devil. Remy further claims than an equivalent number of around 800 persons escaped punishment by fleeing capture or by &quot;a stubborn endurance of the torture.&quot;

Writing more than 400 years later, the scholar William Monter scoffs at these numbers and claims that Lorraine&#x27;s records from the 1580s are &quot;well-preserved&quot; and amount to barely &quot;one-sixth as many as Nicholas Remy boasted in his &quot;Demonalatria&quot; of 1595.&quot; Monter characterizes Remy&#x27;s claim of 800 condemned as &quot;a literary flourish&quot; and refers to Remy as a &quot;humanist&quot; though there does not seem to be any instance in which Remy used the term &quot;humanist&quot; to describe himself. Remy dedicated his book to the Cardinal of Lorraine and characterizes himself a soldier in a war against anti-Christian forces that he considers aligned with the devil. Monter&#x27;s reason for doubting Remy&#x27;s numbers is that Remy&#x27;s book lists the specific names of &quot;only about 125 individuals tried for witchcraft.&quot; Monter compares Remy&#x27;s list to some instances of non-corroboration within the surviving records and concludes that &quot;we must take his numbers with a very large grain of salt; but the documented reality is dreadful enough.&quot;

In forwarding his theory, Monter doesn&#x27;t proffer a reason or motive for Remy to inflate his numbers or why the printer and booksellers (including a number of reprints) would have wanted a brag of &quot;900 Person&#x27;s More or Less&quot; on the title page of Remy&#x27;s work, and whether this may have helped sell books, and if so, what this also might say about the well-educated Latin readers who were the target audience for Remy&#x27;s work, written and sold in a Catholic borderland region during a time period often referred to as the Counter Reformation.

==Pop culture==
*In the 1988 television series &quot;Werewolf&quot;, Nicholas Remy is shown as a werewolf who has been alive since the times of the Inquisition. He used his position as a magistrate to conceal his own lycanthropy. The character was portrayed by Brian Thompson.
*Nicholas Remy and his book, &quot;Daemonolatreiae libri tres&quot;, are also featured in the 1999 movie &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;.

<doc id="273416" wikidata="Q721117" url="?curid=273416" title="Asalluhi">
<text>Asalluhi, also spelled as Asarluhi or Asalluhe, also known as Asaralimnuna, Asaralim, Asalim or Asarnuna was a Mesopotamian god primarily associated with the sphere of incantations and exorcism, commonly operating together with his father Enki. He is likely the same deity as Asar, who was attested starting from the third millennium BCE.

During the Old Babylonian period, Asalluhi gradually became syncretized with Marduk, eventually becoming another name for Marduk.

== Name ==

The name Asalluhi is written phonetically as dasal-lú-ḫi, da-sa-lu-úḫ, da-sa-lú-ḫi or da-sa-al-lú-ḫi. An offering list from Ur III Umma spells the name as dÉ.ŠÁRA-lú-ḫi.

The meaning of Asar remains uncertain. Johandi offers two suggestions, that asar(re) could be a-sar-(re(d)) &quot;swift seed&quot; or a-ari-sar &quot;water impregnating the field plots.&quot; dasar is attested in third millennium god lists, personal names and administrative documents, while the name Asalluhi was first attested until the Ur III period. However, the spelling Asalluhi appeared in an incantation against the demon Samana which Finkel dated to the Old Akkadian period. If the dating is right, then Asalluhi was an attested spelling earlier than the Ur III period.

Jacobsen reads lú-ḫi as lú-ḫe, meaning &quot;man-drenching&quot;, and thus argues that Asalluhi&#x27;s name means &quot;man drenching Asal.&quot; Lambert proposes that the lú-ḫi element in the name Asalluhi may be a phonetic spelling of luḫe, which the meaning of the root luḫ (purge) would be fitting for Asalluhi’s role in incantations related to exorcism. Johandi offers another explanation that since many of the instructions Enki gives to Asalluhi involves mixing together ingredients, lú-ḫi may have originally been an epithet meaning &quot;the mixer&quot; which eventually connected with the original name Asar to form Asalluhi. lú-ḫi could also have been an ellipsis for lú-ḫe-ĝál/nun, meaning &quot;the one of abundance and plenty.&quot;

The Nippur god list from the Old Babylonian period gives Asalluhi another name called Asarag, which could possibly be translated as &quot;the good Asar.&quot; This name is unattested elsewhere.

== Character and iconography ==

Asar was already attested in the Third Millennium as part of incantations, albeit playing a minor role.

Asalluhi often appears in incantations in relation to his father Enki. This type of incantation follows the formula where two deities are engaged in a conversation, discussing how to treat the patient. In his studies on incantations, Falkenstein has dubbed it the Marduk-Ea type invocations. However, the name is not very representative of the whole, and Cunningham has shown that the formula was attested earlier in the Fāra and Ebla texts, with Enlil taking the role of Ea and Ningirima taking the role of Marduk. Earlier incantations had Asalluhi send a messenger to Enki to seek support, but starting in the Ur III period Asalluhi started to occasionally directly seek out Enki in his temple to ask for support, possibly emphasizing the mediating role of temples instead of messengers.

The general structure of the Asalluhi-Enki dialogues starts with Asalluhi noticing a problem and reporting to his father Enki. Enki assures Asalluhi that he knows everything that he knows, and then proceeds to instruct Asalluhi on the procedures.

Geller argued that during the Old Babylonian period the incantation priest would assume the role of Asalluhi, who would be acting as the messenger for Enki. Johandi notes that such a translation would not make sense for some of the texts, and there is nothing like the first millennium texts where the priests directly claim to be in the image of Asalluhi/Marduk, although the option still remains possible.

Asalluhi also appears in what is commonly termed the legitimation-type formula as per Falkenstein. The priests will legitimize themselves by establishing them as the representative of the gods. As most of the incantations of this type are directed against demons, Enki and his circle feature prominently among them. The priest would claim that the incantation is the incantation of gods such as Asalluhi, while in other texts they would claim that the gods themselves cast the incantation. Asalluhi is claimed to be the one to recite the &quot;incantation of Eridu&quot; in the Old Babylonian period, whereas in earlier periods the role was assumed by the human priest.

Asalluhi also features in consecration incantations, which prepares objects and materials for rituals. In particular, he seems to appear in preparing objects for purification.

Although in hymns Asalluhi&#x27;s role as an exorcist is not stated, and outside of incantations his connections with magic are doubtful, his role as a divine exorcist was already well established by the Old Babylonian period. It would still seem that in the Asalluhi-Enki formula, Asalluhi functioned as the executor of Enki&#x27;s orders, and Asalluhi cannot be called an expert, lacking initiative and needing Enki&#x27;s encouragement. In other texts, such as a myth, and incantation texts of other formulas like the legitimation-type, though, Asalluhi is described as an exorcist or as the exorcist of the gods.

In the Sumerian &quot;Temple Hymns&quot;, Asalluhi is described with more aggressive characteristics, listing epithets like &quot;the strong prince&quot;, &quot;the hero&quot;, and was even described as a leopard and a storm. The other name given to Asalluhi in the hymn, Asaralimnuna can either mean &quot;Asar, the princely bison&quot; or &quot;Asar, the bison of the prince.&quot; Johandi notes that this imagery is reminiscent of the young warrior gods archetype, for example Ninurta.

Asalluhi seemed to have a relationship with the deified Shulgi, who was honored in Asalluhi&#x27;s temple in Kuara. Other texts relate Asar/Asalluhi to deities associated with the underworld and other deified kings, so it is possible that Asalluhi may have had a connection with the underworld.

Jacobsen had argued that Asalluhi was originally a storm god based on the reading of lú-ḫi as lú-ḫe, which would translate the name Asalluhi as &quot;man-drenching Asal,&quot; and that Ishkur was also attested with the lú-ḫe epithet. Johandi suggests that it is possible, however there is no other evidence pointing to Asar/Asalluhi originally functioning as a storm god, and points out that a deity being associated with storm imagery does not corroborate to a deity being a storm god with Ninurta being the prime example.

Asalluhi was also said to have granted wisdom to Mesopotamian kings in a couple texts, taking over the role usually reserved for Enki. In Asalluhi A, Asalluhi was described with several traits reminiscent of that of Enki. The sharing of traits with Enki is likely due to the father-son relationship.

In contrast to his usual portrayal as a deity benevolent to humans, some texts, namely Sin-Iddinam&#x27;s prayer to Ninisina and another Old Babylonian letter relate Asalluhi to plagues. Oshima believes that Marduk was the god related to disease and sickness and Sin-iddinam&#x27;s prayer is suggestive of Marduk&#x27;s possible original role before the identification with Asalluhi, but Johandi disagrees and suggests that Asalluhi may have had a similar role prior to the identification with Marduk as the letter was dated quite early (reign of Sumu-abum), although evidence for Asalluhi&#x27;s role in human sickness is scarce. Asalluhi&#x27;s implied ability to cancel incantations could also point to a less benevolent side to the god.

== Associations with other deities ==

Asalluhi is considered the son of Enki, likely due to the close proximity between Kuara and Eridu. Although previously it was believed that the earliest attested father-son relationship between Enki and Asalluhi dated to the Ur III period, Johandi noted that the relationship between Asar and Enki dated back the Early Dynastic Period. In an Early Dynastic incantation against snake-bite, Asar sends a man to his father Enki, to which Enki responds that everything he knows, Asar knows too, mirroring the Asalluhi-Enki incantation formula attested later.
Asalluhi was identified as Enki&#x27;s daughter in one text, and twice in a text from Ugarit. However, as Asalluhi is identified as male in every other text from Mesopotamia, this was likely a scribal mistake.

Asar and Asalluhi are commonly believed to be the same god, but Cunningham suggests that Asar and Asalluhi may have originally been separate gods, as an Old Babylonian god list refers to Asar and Asalluhi separately in consecutive lines. Johandi believes that the separation between Asar and Asalluhi was to distinguish Marduk and Asalluhi apart, not Asar and Asalluhi. The possibility cannot be excluded that Asar, Asalluhi and Asaralimnuna were originally different deities, but it is also just as likely that they were the same god.

During the Old Babylonian period, Asalluhi started to be syncretized with Marduk, with Sin-iddinam&#x27;s prayer to Ninisina offering the earliest evidence of such syncretism. Another Old Babylonian text substitutes &quot;son of Eridu&quot; with &quot;lord of Tintir&quot; as a title for Asalluhi. A hymn to Asalluhi (Asalluhi A) identifies Asalluhi with Marduk. and a hymn to Marduk from Sippar calls him Asalluhi. A prayer made to Marduk/Asalluhi by Hammurabi clearly views the two to be the same deity. Asalluhi is often substituted with Marduk in the Akkadian bilinguals of the incantations starting from the Old Babylonian period, although some bilinguals still write Asalluhi in the Akkadian version. However, in the Old Babylonian period the syncretism was not yet complete, as one incantation text mentions Marduk and Asalluhi separately and occupying different roles, with Marduk capturing the victim either because of powerlessness or he refused to help, and Asalluhi reporting to Enki and securing a treatment for the victim. Another incantation text against Lamashtu lists Asalluhi and Marduk separately as deterrence to the demon. A prayer for Samsu-iluna also lists Marduk and Asalluhi separately, perhaps as a deliberate policy by Samsu-iluna to reclaim authority over the rebellious south, or as indication that the syncretism was not complete yet during the Old Babylonian period.

It is unclear why Asalluhi and Marduk were syncretized. Sommerfield suggested that both gods had similar traits and were gods of incantations, while Johandi believes that Marduk and Asalluhi were syncretized together for something other than magic. Lambert suggests that Marduk&#x27;s syncretism with Asalluhi was purely political to make Marduk more respectable.

The name of the wife of Asalluhi was probably Panunanki or Eru(a), judging by how both names were known as alternative names for Marduk&#x27;s wife Zarpanit. A goddess known as Ninmeḫama appeared together with Asalluhi in The Lamentation for Sumer and Ur. Her actual name could probably be Nin é-HA.A-ke4, meaning &quot;lady of the temple of Kuara.&quot; She was likely viewed as Asalluhi&#x27;s wife, especially as a god list equated Ninmeḫama with Sarpanit.

During the Early Dynastic period, Asar was seemingly associated with other deities, particularly Ashgi and Ishkur. Ninshubur may have also had a connection with Asalluhi. Asalluhi sometimes appears together with Utu in incantation texts, which Johandi interprets as possibly due to influence from syncretism with Marduk, although the sun god was already noted to appear in incantations in connection with deities related to water, including Enki.

==Worship ==

Asalluhi&#x27;s cult center was the city of Kuara. A text from Abu Salabikh praised Asar-lú-KAL of Kuara, and a hymn praised Asalluhi as the patron god of Kuara, giving him the epithet &quot;highly esteemed prince.&quot;

An offering list from Girsu during the Lagash II period lists Asar, who received one sila of princely oil and one sila of dates. Asar/Asalluhi appears in administrative texts from the Ur III period, most commonly from Puzrish-Dagan. Despite being the god of the city of Kuara, in the Ur III texts Ninsun repeatedly receives more offerings than Asalluhi, meaning that Ninsun was likely perceived as the more important deity in Kuara during the Ur III period. Asalluhi appears often with the circle of Enki in offering lists from Nippur and Umma in the Ur III period. It would also seem like Asalluhi received regular offerings in Ur III Girsu. He appears in offering lists from Larsa, Ur and Nippur in the Old Babylonian period, also together with the circle of Enki. As the son and less important god, Asalluhi is generally given fewer offerings than Enki and Damgalnuna. In texts outside of incantations, Asalluhi appears after Enki and Damgalnuna, forming a triad attested since the Ur III period.

<text>Eastern Rumelia (; ; ) was an autonomous province (&quot;oblast&quot; in Bulgarian, &quot;vilayet&quot; in Turkish) of the Ottoman Empire with a total area of , which was created in 1878 by virtue of the Treaty of Berlin and &quot;de facto&quot; ceased to exist in 1885, when it was united with the Principality of Bulgaria, also under nominal Ottoman suzerainty. It continued to be an Ottoman province &quot;de jure&quot; until 1908, when Bulgaria declared independence. Ethnic Bulgarians formed a majority of the population in Eastern Rumelia, but there were significant Turkish and Greek minorities. Its capital was Plovdiv (Ottoman &quot;Filibe&quot;, Greek &quot;Philippoupoli&quot;). The official languages of Eastern Rumelia were Bulgarian, Greek and Ottoman Turkish.

==History==
Eastern Rumelia was created as an autonomous province within the Ottoman Empire by the Treaty of Berlin in 1878. The region roughly corresponded to today&#x27;s southern Bulgaria, which was also the name the Russians proposed for it; this proposal was rejected by the British. It encompassed the territory between the Balkan Mountains, the Rhodope Mountains and Strandzha, a region known to all its inhabitantsBulgarians, Ottoman Turks, Greeks, Roma, Armenians and Jewsas Northern Thrace. The artificial name, Eastern Rumelia, was given to the province on the insistence of the British delegates to the Congress of Berlin: the Ottoman notion of &quot;Rumelia&quot; refers to all European regions of the empire, i.e. those that were in Antiquity under the Roman Empire. Some twenty Pomak (Bulgarian Muslim) villages in the Rhodope Mountains refused to recognize Eastern Rumelian authority and formed the so-called &quot;Republic of Tamrash&quot;.

The province is remembered today by philatelists for having issued postage stamps from 1880 on. See the main article, Postage stamps and postal history of Eastern Rumelia.

===Unification with Bulgaria===
After a bloodless revolution on 6 September 1885, the province was annexed by the Principality of Bulgaria, which was &quot;de jure&quot; an Ottoman tributary state but &quot;de facto&quot; functioned as independent. After the Bulgarian victory in the subsequent Serbo-Bulgarian War, the &quot;status quo&quot; was recognized by the Porte with the Tophane Agreement on 24 March 1886. With the Tophane Act, Sultan Abdul Hamid II appointed the Prince of Bulgaria (without mentioning the name of the incumbent prince Alexander of Bulgaria) as Governor-General of Eastern Rumelia, thus retaining the formal distinction between the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia and preserving the letter of the Berlin Treaty. However, it was clear to the Great Powers that the union between the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia was permanent, and not to be dissolved. The Republic of Tamrash and the region of Kardzhali were reincorporated in the Ottoman Empire. The province was nominally under Ottoman suzerainty until Bulgaria became &quot;de jure&quot; independent in 1908. 6 September, Unification Day, is a national holiday in Bulgaria.

==Government==
According to the Treaty of Berlin, Eastern Rumelia was to remain under the political and military jurisdiction of the Ottoman Empire with significant administrative autonomy (Article 13). The law frame of Eastern Rumelia was defined with the Organic Statute which was adopted on 14 April 1879 and was in force until the Unification with Bulgaria in 1885. According to the Organic Statute the head of the province was a Christian Governor-General appointed by the Sublime Porte with the approval of the Great Powers. The legislative organ was the Provincial Counsel which consisted of 56 persons, of which 10 were appointed by the governor-general, 10 were permanent and 36 were directly elected by the people.
Arkady Stolypin was the Russian civil administrator from 9 October 1878 to 18 May 1879. The first governor-general was Prince Alexander Bogoridi (1879–1884), a Bulgarian aristocrat, who was acceptable to both Bulgarians and Greeks in the province. The second governor-general was Gavril Krastevich (1884–1885), a Bulgarian historian.

During the period of Bulgarian annexation Georgi Stranski was appointed as a commissioner for South Bulgaria (9 September 1885 – 5 April 1886), and when the province was restored to nominal Ottoman sovereignty, but still under Bulgarian control, the prince of Bulgaria was recognized by the Sublime Porte as the governor-general in the Tophane Agreement of 1886.

===Governors-general===
==Administrative divisions==

Eastern Rumelia consisted of the departments (called in Bulgarian окръзи &quot;okrazi&quot;, in Ottoman terminology &quot;sanjaks&quot;) of Plovdiv (Пловдив, Filibe), Tatarpazardzhik (Татарпазарджик, Tatarpazarcığı), Haskovo (Хасково, Hasköy), Stara Zagora (Стара Загора, Eski Zağra), Sliven (Сливен, İslimye) and Burgas (Бургас, Burgaz), in turn divided into 28 cantons (equivalent to Bulgarian околии &quot;okolii&quot;, Ottoman &quot;kazas&quot;).

The cantons were:
*Department of Plovdiv: Plovdiv, Konush (the canton seat was in Stanimaka), Ovchi Halm (seat in Golyamo Konare), Stryama (seat in Karlovo), Sarnena Gora (seat in Brezovo) and Rupchos (seat in Chepelare)
*Department of Pazardzhik: Pazardzhik, Peshtera, Panagyurishte and Ihtiman
*Department of Haskovo: Haskovo, Hadzhi Eles, Harmanli and Kardzhali
*Department of Stara Zagora: Stara Zagora, Kazanlak, Chirpan, Nova Zagora and Tarnovo Seymen
*Department of Sliven: Sliven, Yambol, Kazalagach, Kavakli and Kotel
*Department of Burgas: Burgas, Anhialo, Karnobat and Aytos

==Population and ethnic demographics==
===Pre 1878===
The following is a district-by-district population extract from the 1876 Ottoman salname for the Vilayet of Adrianople, which is in turn based on the vilayet-wide census of 1875. As is common for Ottoman statistics, figures refer to &quot;males&quot; only (figures at the bottom are male-female aggregated estimates):
===Post 1878===

According to a British report before the 1877–1878 war, the non-Muslim population (consisting mostly of Bulgarians) of Eastern Rumelia was about 60%, a proportion that grew due to the flight and emigration of Muslims during and after the war. The 1878 census show a population of 815,946 people- 573,231 Bulgarians (70.29%), 174,759 Muslims (21.43%), 42,516 Greeks (5.21%), 19,524 Roma, 4,177 Jews, and 1,306 Armenians.

The results of the first Regional Assembly elections of 17 October 1879 show a predominantly Bulgarian character: Of the 36 elected deputies, 31 were Bulgarians (86.1%), 3 were Greeks (8.3%) and two were Turks (5.6%). The ethnic statistics from the censuses of 1880 and 1884 show a Bulgarian majority in the province. In the discredited census of 1880, out of total population of 815,951 people some 590,000 (72.3%) self-identified as Bulgarians, 158,000 (19.4%) as Turks, 19,500 (2.4%) as Roma, and 48,000 (5.9%) belonged to other ethnicities, notably Greeks, Armenians and Jews. The repetition of the census in 1884 returned similar data: 70.0% Bulgarians, 20.6% Turks, 2.8% Roma and 6.7% others.

The Greek inhabitants of Eastern Rumelia were concentrated on the coast, where they were strong in numbers, and certain cities in the interior such as Plovdiv (known in Greek as &quot;Philippopolis&quot;), where they formed a substantial minority. Most of the Greek population of the region was exchanged with Bulgarians from the Greek provinces of Macedonia and Thrace in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars and World War I.

Eastern Rumelia was also inhabited by foreign nationals, most notably Austrians, Czechs, Hungarians, French people and Italians.

The ethnic composition of the population of Eastern Rumelia, according to the provincial census taken in 1884, was the following:
The population&#x27;s ethnic composition in the Bulgarian provinces of Pazardzhik, Plovdiv, Stara Zagora, Haskovo, Sliven, Yambol and Burgas, which have approximately the same territory as Eastern Rumelia according to the 2001 census is the following:
==Property rights==

Property abandoned by Muslims fleeing the Imperial Russian Army during the 1877–1878 war was appropriated by the local Christian population. The former owners, mostly large landholders, were threatened with trial by military court if they had committed crimes during the war so that they would not return. Two Turkish landowners who did return were in fact sentenced to death thus preventing others from desiring to come back. Those Turkish landowners who were not able to take possession of their land were financially compensated, with the funds collected by the Bulgarian peasants, some of whom were indebted as a result. For those who did return a 10% property tax was issued, forcing many to sell off their property in order to pay the tax. Michael Palairet claimed that land rights of Muslim owners were largely disregarded, despite being guaranteed by the great powers, and the de-Ottomanization of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia led to economic decline in the region. Though this is contradicted by many other authors, who show rapid growth of the economy as well as rapid industrial development and growth of exports in Bulgaria after 1878.

<text>Traditionally, an oath (from Anglo-Saxon &#x27;, also aplight) is a statement of fact or a promise taken by a sacrality as a sign of verity. A common legal substitute for those who object to making sacred oaths is to give an affirmation instead. Nowadays, even when there is no notion of sanctity involved, certain promises said out loud in ceremonial or juridical purpose are referred to as oaths. &quot;To swear&quot; is a verb used to describe the taking of an oath; to make a solemn vow.

==Etymology==
The word comes from Anglo-Saxon &quot;&quot;: &quot;judicial swearing, solemn appeal to deity in witness of truth or a promise&quot;; from Proto-Germanic &quot;*aiþaz&quot;; from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*oi-to-&quot;: &quot;an oath&quot;. Common to Celtic and Germanic, possibly a loan-word from one to the other, but the history is obscure and it may be non-Indo-European, in reference to careless invocations of divinity, from the late 12th century.

==Historical development as a legal concept==

=== Jewish tradition ===
The concept of oaths is deeply rooted within Judaism. It is found in Genesis 8:21, when God swears that he will &quot;never again curse the ground because of man and never again smite every living thing&quot;. This repetition of the term &quot;never again&quot; is explained by Rashi, the pre-eminent biblical commentator, as serving as an oath, citing the Talmud Shavous 36a for this ruling.

The first personage in the biblical tradition to take an oath is held to be Eliezer, the chief servant of Abraham, when the latter requested of the former that he not take a wife for his son Isaac from the daughters of Canaan, but rather from among Abraham&#x27;s own family.

The foundational text for oath making is in Numbers 30:2: &quot;When a man voweth a vow unto the Lord, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.&quot; According to the Rabbis, a neder (usually translated as &quot;vow&quot;) refers to the object, a &quot;shâmar&quot; (usually translated as &quot;oath&quot;) to the person. The passage distinguishes between a &quot;neder&quot; and a &quot;shvua&quot;, an important distinction between the two in Halakha: a &quot;neder&quot; changes the status of some external thing, while a &quot;shvua&quot; initiates an internal change in the one who swears the oath.

=== Roman tradition ===
In the Roman tradition, oaths were sworn upon &quot;Iuppiter Lapis&quot; or the Jupiter Stone located in the Temple of Jupiter, Capitoline Hill. &quot;Iuppiter Lapis&quot; was held in the Roman tradition to be an Oath Stone, an aspect of Jupiter in his role as divine law-maker responsible for order and used principally for the investiture of the oathtaking of office.

According to Cyril Bailey, in &quot;The Religion of Ancient Rome&quot; (1907):

The punisher of broken oaths was the infernal deity Orcus.

=== Hindu tradition ===
In Hindu epics, like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, oaths, called &quot;pratigya&quot;, are taken seriously. It is mentioned that people would give up their lives, but not break a vow. Due to this, King Dasharatha took an oath for his Queen Kaikeyi (on her maid, Manthara&#x27;s insistence) and thus had to exile his favorite son, Lord Rama along with his wife Devi Sita and brother Lakshmana for fourteen years in the forest.

In the Mahabharata, Devrata took an oath of celibacy so that Satyavati&#x27;s father would marry her to Devrata&#x27;s father, King Shantanu. He also took an oath to not rule the kingdom and remain loyal to the king, who would be a descendant of Satyavati. Thus, Devavrata got the name &quot;Bhishma&quot;, which means someone who has taken a terrible oath. Many others also took oaths that they fulfilled.

=== Greek tradition ===
Walter Burkert has shown that since Lycurgus of Athens (d. 324 BCE), who held that &quot;it is the oath which holds democracy together&quot;, religion, morality and political organization had been linked by the oath, and the oath and its prerequisite altar had become the basis of both civil and criminal, as well as international law.

In traditional Greek folk songs, such as The Dead Brother&#x27;s Song, the significance of the oath is highlighted. The power of an oath is such that it transcends death, as the deceased brother arises from the grave to fulfill his oath to his mother.

===Christian tradition===
Various religious groups have objected to the taking of oaths, most notably the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and Anabaptist groups, like Mennonites, Amish, Hutterites and Schwarzenau Brethren. This is principally based on Matthew 5:34–37, the Antithesis of the Law. Here, Christ is reported as having said: &quot;I say to you: &#x27;Swear not at all. James the Just stated in 5:12 &quot;Above all, my brothers, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. Let your &#x27;Yes&#x27; be yes, and your &#x27;No&#x27;, no, or you will be condemned.&quot; Beyond this scriptural authority, Quakers place importance on being truthful at all times, so the testimony opposing oaths springs from a view that &quot;taking legal oaths implies a double standard of truthfulness&quot; suggesting that truthfulness in legal contexts is somehow more important than truthfulness in non-legal contexts and that truthfulness in those other contexts is therefore somehow less important.

Not all Christians interpret this reading as forbidding all types of oaths, however. Opposition to oath-taking among some groups of Christian caused many problems for these groups throughout their history. Quakers were frequently imprisoned because of their refusal to swear loyalty oaths. Testifying in court was also difficult; George Fox, Quakers&#x27; founder, famously challenged a judge who had asked him to swear, saying that he would do so once the judge could point to any Bible passage where Jesus or his apostles took oaths — the judge could not, but this did not allow Fox to escape punishment. Legal reforms from the 18th century onwards mean that everyone in the United Kingdom now has the right to make a solemn affirmation instead of an oath. The United States has permitted affirmations since it was founded; it is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. Only President Franklin Pierce has chosen to affirm rather than swear at his inauguration.

As late as 1880, Charles Bradlaugh was denied a seat as an MP in the Parliament of the United Kingdom because of his professed atheism as he was judged unable to swear the Oath of Allegiance in spite of his proposal to swear the oath as a &quot;matter of form&quot;.

=== Islamic tradition ===
Islam takes the fulfillment of oaths extremely seriously, as directed by the Qur&#x27;an:

=== Germanic tradition ===
Germanic warrior culture was significantly based on oaths of fealty.

A prose passage inserted in the eddic poem &quot;Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar&quot; relates: Hedin was coming home alone from the forest one Yule-eve, and found a troll-woman; she rode on a wolf, and had snakes in place of a bridle. She asked Hedin for his company. &quot;Nay,&quot; said he. She said, &quot;Thou shalt pay for this at the &quot;bragarfull&quot;.&quot; That evening the great vows were taken; the sacred boar was brought in, the men laid their hands thereon, and took their vows at the &quot;bragarfull&quot;. Hedin vowed that he would have Sváva, Eylimi&#x27;s daughter, the beloved of his brother Helgi; then such great grief seized him that he went forth on wild paths southward over the land, and found Helgi, his brother.

Such Norse traditions are directly parallel to the &quot;bird oaths&quot; of late medieval France, such as the voeux du faisan (oath on the pheasant) or the (fictional) voeux du paon (oath on the peacock). Huizinga, &quot;The Autumn of the Middle Ages&quot; (ch. 3); Michel Margue, &quot;Vogelgelübde&quot; am Hof des Fürsten. Ritterliches Integrationsritual zwischen Traditions- und Gegenwartsbezug (14. – 15. Jahrhundert)

=== Modern law ===


In the modern law, oaths are made by a witness to a court of law before giving testimony and usually by a newly appointed government officer to the people of a state before taking office. However, in both of those cases, an affirmation can usually be replaced with a written statement, only if the author swears the statement is true. This statement is called an &quot;affidavit&quot;. This is in contrast to a statutory declaration, where no sworn oath or affirmation is involved. The oath given to support an affidavit is frequently administered by a notary, who will certify the giving of the oath by affixing her or his seal to the document. Willfully delivering a false oath (or affirmation) is the crime of perjury.

There are some places where there is a confusion between the &quot;oath&quot; and other statements or promises. For example, the current Olympic Oath is really a pledge, not properly an oath, since there is only a promise but there is no appeal to a sacred witness. Oaths may also be confused with vows, but vows are really just a particular kind of an oath.

== Hand gestures ==
Instead of, or in addition to, holding one&#x27;s hand upon an object of ceremonial importance, it can be customary for a person swearing an oath to hold a raised hand in a specific gesture. Most often the right hand is raised. This custom has been explained with reference to medieval practices of branding palms.

===Schwurhand===
===Serbian custom===
===International customs===
The Scout Sign can be made while giving the Scout Promise. In &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; the movement&#x27;s founder, Robert Baden-Powell, instructed: &quot;While taking this oath the scout will stand, holding his right hand raised level with his shoulder, palm to the front, thumb resting on the nail of the digitus minimus (little finger) and the other three fingers upright, pointing upwards.&quot;

<text>The Wile Carding Mill is a defunct but still operational carding mill, in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, Canada. The mill is now owned by the Province of Nova Scotia and operated as a museum by the DesBrisay Museum.

This water-powered mill was owned and operated by the Wile family from 1860 to 1968. The Wiles ran the mill but employed a number of workers, usually unmarried women, to operate the machinery. The mill was powered by a 7-horsepower (5 kW) overshot waterwheel using the water of Shady Brook, a tributary of the Lahave River.

It became a Registered Heritage Property in Bridgewater in 2013.

<text>Air Supply is a soft rock duo formed in Melbourne, Australia, in 1975, consisting of Englishman Graham Russell (vocals, guitar) and Australian Russell Hitchcock (vocals). With record sales of 100 million worldwide, they had a succession of hits worldwide, including eight top-five hits on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;Lost in Love&quot; (1979), &quot;All Out of Love&quot;, &quot;Every Woman in the World&quot; (both 1980), &quot;The One That You Love&quot;, &quot;Here I Am&quot; (both 1981), &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, &quot;Even the Nights Are Better&quot; (both 1982) and &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot; (1983). In Australia, they had four top ten placements with &quot;Love and Other Bruises&quot; (1976), &quot;All Out of Love&quot;, &quot;Every Woman in the World&quot; and &quot;The One That You Love&quot;. Their highest charting studio album, &quot;The One That You Love&quot; (1981) reached number ten in both Australia and the US. The group, which relocated to Los Angeles in the late 1970s, has included many members, with Hitchcock and Russell at the core. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) inducted Air Supply into their Hall of Fame on 1 December 2013, at the annual ARIA Awards.

==History==
===Formation and early years: 1975–1980===
Air Supply&#x27;s founding members met on 12 May 1975, while rehearsing for the Australian production of the musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. Chrissie Hammond portrayed Mary Magdalene, while Russell Hitchcock and Graham Russell were in the chorus. With the show they toured Australia and New Zealand for 18 months. In 1958, as a three-year-old, English-born Hammond had migrated to Melbourne with her family, including older sister Lyndsay Hammond, who also became a rock singer. Russell, also English-born, had been a percussionist in United Kingdom group, Union Blues, in 1965. After arriving in Australia in 1968, Russell performed solo and was later a member of Eli Flash with Hammond. Hitchcock left school in 1965 to work as a salesman, also joining a group, 19th Generation, on drums and vocals.

With Hammond and Hitchcock on vocals and Russell on guitar, they formed Air Supply as a harmony vocal group in Melbourne in 1975. When the show&#x27;s run finished in late 1976, Hammond departed to form a hard rock group, Cheetah, with her sister. Hammond was replaced in the group by Jeremy Paul (ex-Soffrok) who provided bass guitar and backing vocals. Paul had joined the cast of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; when it reached Brisbane and continued with the show to New Zealand. According to Paul, the group&#x27;s name was &quot;indicative of the sound and feeling forming the relationships within the band&quot;. The group&#x27;s first single, &quot;Love and Other Bruises&quot;, was released in October 1976 and peaked at No. 6 on the Australian Kent Music Report singles chart. Russell recalled that they had been unable to promote &quot;Love and Other Bruises&quot; while still performing in &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, due to contractual obligations to the show. It was first aired on weekly teen pop music TV show, &quot;Countdown&quot; in early December 1976. It remains their highest charting single in Australia.

The group followed with their debut album, &quot;Air Supply&quot;, in December 1976, which reached No. 17 on the Kent Music Report albums chart and achieved gold accreditation for shipment of 20,000 copies. It was produced by Peter Dawkins (Spectrum, Ross Ryan) with the line-up of Hitchcock, Paul, Russell and drummer Jeff Browne, guitarist Mark McEntee, and keyboardist Adrian Scott. Other singles were &quot;If You Knew Me&quot;, &quot;Empty Pages&quot; and &quot;Feel the Breeze&quot;, but none reached the top 40. McEntee had left Air Supply by the end of 1976 to work as a session musician. In 1980, bandmates McEntee and Paul formed Divinyls alongside Chrissy Amphlett. Air Supply undertook a national tour in support of their debut album with Hitchcock, Paul, Russell and Scott joined by Nigel Macara (ex–Tamam Shud, Ariel) on drums and Brenton White (Skintight) on guitar. Brenton White rehearsed but did not perform with Air Supply. In April 1977, portions of their music videos for &quot;Empty Pages&quot; and &quot;Do What You Do&quot; were screened on &quot;Countdown&quot;.

Their second album, &quot;The Whole Thing&#x27;s Started&quot;, also produced by Dawkins, was released in July 1977, with White replaced on lead guitar by Rex Goh. The album provided three singles, but neither album nor singles charted in the top 40. In mid-1977, the group supported Rod Stewart during his tour of Australia, and he invited them to continue to the United States and Canada. Mid-tour they worked on their third album, &quot;Love &amp; Other Bruises&quot;, in Los Angeles from July to August. It included re-recordings of tracks from their previous two albums, with Jimmy Horowitz producing, and was released later that year in the US on Columbia Records. At the end of 1977, Paul left and the line-up of Hitchcock, Macara, Goh and Russell, were joined by Joey Carbone on keyboards, Robin Le Mesurier on co-lead guitar and Howard Sukimoto on bass guitar. Air Supply performed in London supporting Chicago and Boz Scaggs.

Although their music had some commercial success, Russell claimed, on a 1995 DVD, that he and Hitchcock were so poor that they checked the backs of hotel sofas for change so that they could buy bread to make toast. By early 1978, the line-up was Hitchcock, Macara and Russell, with Ken Francis on guitar, Rick Mellick on keyboards and Bill Putt (Spectrum, Ariel) on bass guitar. In April of that year, Russell was considering relocating to Los Angeles: &quot;Even though it&#x27;s expensive it&#x27;s the music centre of the world. In Australia you can hit yourself against a brick wall.&quot; By mid-1978, only Hitchcock and Russell remained, backed by Ralph Cooper (Windchase) on drums, and former Sailor members Brian Hamilton on bass guitar and vocals and David Moyse on guitar.

In April 1979, the band released &quot;Life Support&quot;, a concept album which included a picture disc on its first pressing. It was recorded at Trafalgar Studios, Sydney. The album had a five-and-a-half-minute version of &quot;Lost in Love&quot;, written by Russell, which was released as a single and peaked at No. 13 in Australia and No.3 in New Zealand. The track caught the attention of Arista Records boss Clive Davis, who remixed the song and released it as a single in the US early the following year. The line-up for the album kept Hitchcock, Russell, Cooper, and Moyse, and added Criston Barker (bass guitar) and Frank Esler-Smith (keyboards) with help from other session musicians. Esler-Smith had previously known Hitchcock and Russell from working with them in &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.
A remixed version of &quot;Lost in Love&quot; was issued internationally as a single in January 1980 on Arista Records. The associated album, &quot;Lost in Love&quot;, appeared in March, which was co-produced by Robie Porter, Rick Chertoff and Charles Fisher. It contained three US top five singles, including the title track, which peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The others were &quot;Every Woman in the World&quot; (No. 5) and &quot;All Out of Love&quot; (No. 2). The latter two singles were top 10 hits in Australia, with &quot;All Out of Love&quot; also reaching No. 11 on the United Kingdom Singles Chart and No. 17 in the Netherlands. The album had the same line-up of Barker, Cooper, Esler-Smith, Hitchcock, Moyse and Russell. It sold three million copies in the US and peaked at No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It reached No, 21 in Australia and No. 22 in New Zealand.

=== 1981–1990 ===
Air Supply&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;The One That You Love&quot; (July 1981), was produced by Harry Maslin with the title track issued as a single in April. It is the group&#x27;s only No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album provided two more US top five hits, &quot;Here I Am (Just When I Thought I Was Over You)&quot; (August) and &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; (December). A fourth single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Get Enough of You&quot;, a cover version of Samantha Sang&#x27;s song, was released in Japan in 1981 and achieved top ten status there. During recording, Barker left and was replaced by David Green on bass guitar, while early member Goh returned on guitar.

From 1981 Air Supply regularly appeared on US music show, &quot;Solid Gold&quot; (1980–1988). Hitchcock and Russell also filled-in as co-hosts when resident co-host Andy Gibb was unavailable. Gibb&#x27;s attendance on the show became problematic and he was fired in 1982. The duo co-hosted the show in October 1983 (with Marilyn McCoo) and September 1985 (with Dionne Warwick).

Their seventh studio album &quot;Now and Forever&quot;, was released in June 1982 with the line-up of Cooper, Esler-Smith, Goh, Green, Hitchcock, Moyse and Russell; it was produced by Maslin, again. It continued the group&#x27;s popularity in the US with top 5 hit &quot;Even the Nights Are Better&quot; (June) and two top 40 singles, &quot;Young Love&quot; and &quot;Two Less Lonely People in the World&quot; (November). On the Australian singles chart, &quot;Even the Nights Are Better&quot; reached the top 40 and is the group&#x27;s last single to do so. It also peaked in the top 40 in New Zealand.

They released their first compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, in August 1983, which included a new single, &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot; (July), written by Jim Steinman. The album reached number one in Australia, number two in New Zealand, and number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 – selling 5 million copies in the US by March 1993 according to Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

&quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot; was their equal second biggest US hit (with &quot;All Out of Love&quot;) at No. 2, behind their only US number-one single, &quot;The One That You Love&quot;. The band also released their first live video album, &quot;Air Supply Live in Hawaii&quot; in 1983. Their song &quot;I Can Wait Forever&quot;, which was co-written by Russell with David Foster and Jay Graydon, was featured in a scene of the film, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (June 1984), and was included on its soundtrack album in the same month.

By the mid-1980s, Goh, Green and Moyse had all left, and the band&#x27;s February 1985 self-titled album had Cooper, Esler-Smith, Hitchcock and Russell joined by Wally Stocker (ex-the Babys) on guitar, Don Cromwell on bass guitar, and Ken Rarick on keyboards. This album included their last top 20 &quot;Billboard&quot; hit with their rendition of Rob Hegel&#x27;s 1982 single, &quot;Just as I Am&quot; (May 1985), which was also their last charting single in Australia. They released a cover version of Jennifer Rush&#x27;s &quot;The Power of Love&quot; in July, which reached No. 21 in New Zealand, and they had a minor US hit with &quot;Lonely Is the Night&quot; from the album &quot;Hearts in Motion&quot; (August 1986) – their last US charting studio album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Russell and Hitchcock recorded a 1987 &quot;Christmas Album&quot;, containing the holiday single &quot;The Eyes of a Child&quot;, before taking a break as a band. During this time, Hitchcock released a solo self-titled album in 1988 which was not a big seller. However, his single &quot;Swear to Your Heart&quot; (1990) – from the soundtrack album for the film &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; – received significant airplay and reached the top ten on the US Adult Contemporary chart.

=== 1991–2000 ===
Using previous producer, Maslin and the returning Cooper, the duo recorded &quot;The Earth Is ...&quot;, which was released in July 1991 by Giant Records/Warner Bros. Records. It contains their rendition of Badfinger&#x27;s &quot;Without You&quot;, which reached the US Adult Contemporary top 50. Other singles from the album are &quot;Stronger Than the Night&quot; and &quot;Stop the Tears&quot;. The album is dedicated to Frank Esler-Smith who had died in March of that year, from pneumonia. The official fan club released &quot;The Earth Is World Tour&quot; video, which contains live footage from the band&#x27;s global tour.

They followed with their twelfth studio album, &quot;The Vanishing Race&quot;, in May 1993, which was supported by the single &quot;Goodbye&quot; (September), with lyrics by David Foster and Linda Thompson. Although it did not chart in Australian or the US Top 100, it was critically praised in Asia, where in many countries it reached number No. 1. In Taiwan, Power Station and Terry Lin, the latter of whom has admitted to have been influenced by Air Supply, covered &quot;Goodbye&quot; but renamed it &quot;Loving you is not like loving the sea&quot; in 2009. &quot;It&#x27;s Never Too Late&quot; was the album&#x27;s second single.

They undertook another world tour in 1993 alongside Earth, Wind &amp; Fire guitarist Dick Smith. The album was dedicated to the plight of the Native Americans, the Vanishing Race of the album&#x27;s title, and sold 4 million copies. Their third album of the decade, &quot;News from Nowhere&quot;, was released in 1995. It contained the Asian hit singles &quot;Someone&quot;, &quot;Always&quot;, and a cover of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;.

The duo&#x27;s popularity continued in South-east Asia, culminating in the release of &quot;Greatest Hits Live ... Now and Forever&quot; (June 1996), a CD and DVD recording of two live concerts from mid-June 1995 in Taipei, Taiwan, which stayed at the top of the Hong Kong album charts for 15 weeks. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic rated the album at two-and-a-half stars out-of-five and explained, &quot;it&#x27;s slick and professional... but the intent is clearly replication, not interpretation... it&#x27;s not bad — it&#x27;s pleasant, even — but it&#x27;s not necessary.&quot; Hitchcock combined with Judith Durham (of the Seekers) and Mandawuy Yunupingu (of Yothu Yindi) for a cover version of &quot;I Am Australian&quot; (originally by Bruce Woodley of the Seekers and Dobe Newton of the Bushwackers), which was issued as a single in January 1997. It reached No. 17 on the ARIA singles chart.

===2001–2011===

From the late 1990s Air Supply toured Asia and select US venues into the new millennium. They released further adult contemporary albums, &quot;The Book of Love&quot; (1997), &quot;Yours Truly&quot; (2001), and &quot;Across the Concrete Sky&quot; (2003). In 2005 they issued live albums both on CD and DVD. They performed in Havana, Cuba, becoming one of the first foreign bands invited to perform in the country. They were scheduled to perform two concerts, and played the first show on 7 July, the day before Hurricane Dennis hit the island. In high winds, that concert had an audience of 175,000. Due to the hurricane, the second show was cancelled. Fans staying at their hotel on 8 July had Russell performing acoustically for them, as there was no electricity. Songs were used in feature films, &quot;Bad Company&quot; (2002), &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot; and &quot;The Wedding Date&quot; (both 2005).

In 2006 they issued an acoustic album, &quot;The Singer and the Song&quot;. To support it they made their first trip to India in May 2006. On 2 December 2006, the duo performed to a capacity crowd in Kingston, Jamaica. This was their second visit, after performing at the Air Jamaica Jazz and Blues Festival in January. In 2007 Russell released his first adult contemporary solo album, &quot;The Future&quot;. He also made an appearance in the film &quot;Believe&quot; (2007), a comedy about multi-level marketing. In 2008 based on their chart performances, they were ranked the 83rd best musical act of all time in &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100&#x27;s 50th anniversary edition.

In May 2010, Air Supply released &quot;Mumbo Jumbo&quot;, the duo&#x27;s first studio album in eight years. It was recorded at Russell&#x27;s home studio near Park City, Utah and at Odds on Records&#x27; state of the art facilities in Las Vegas with session musicians and an orchestra. It was produced by Russell and engineered by Sean O&#x27;Dwyer (Pink Floyd, Randy Newman and Blink-182). The first single &quot;Dance with Me&quot; reached number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart and &quot;Faith in Love&quot;, which peaked at number 30. The music video for &quot;All Out of Love&quot; is seen briefly in the 2010 Australian film, &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot;.

===2011–present===

In October 2012 Air Supply were honoured by Gray Line&#x27;s Ride of Fame. A double-decker tour bus was dedicated to them, which roamed the streets of New York City. On 24 October 2013 the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) announced that Air Supply were to be inducted into their Hall of Fame on 1 December 2013 at the same ceremony as the ARIA Music Awards of 2013. Speaking on behalf of the duo, Hitchcock declared it was a great honour for them and was totally unexpected. He continued that the pair were due to return to Australia for the ceremony and &quot;have fun with everybody and we want to say thank you to all who participated in our ARIA Hall of Fame induction.&quot;

In 2014, the group were approached by the Wideboys to remix their single &quot;Desert Sea Sky&quot;. Penned by Russell, the UK remix duo created multiple versions of the song to suit &quot;Billboard&quot; dance club DJs, clubs, radio stations and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart. On 2 December 2014, Evolution Music Group released Air Supply&#x27;s first high-definition concert film, &quot;Air Supply - Live in Hong Kong&quot; on their evosound label. The album was released on blu-ray, DVD, CD and LP formats. The concert was recorded on 11 August 2013 at Asia World-Expo, Hong Kong. It showcased new songs, &quot;Desert Sea Sky&quot;, &quot;Dance with Me&quot; and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Stop Living You&quot;, alongside their earlier hits.

&quot;I Want You&quot; reached number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart in September 2015. They also released the single &quot;I Adore You&quot; that same month. Air Supply were scheduled to perform in Haifa on 25 November 2016 but postponed due to fires in the region. The band gave 200 free tickets to the wives of the firemen through the Haifa Fire Department workers union.

A jukebox musical based on Air Supply&#x27;s songs, &quot;All Out of Love: The Musical&quot; (October 2018), was made in the Philippines. It was created and produced by Naomi Toohey and Dale Harrison, and written by Canadian playwright Jim Millan. It starred Mig Ayesa, Rachel Alejandro, Tanya Manalang, Raymund Concepcion and Jamie Wilson. It premiered at the Newport Performing Arts Theater in Resorts World Manila. It included a new song, &quot;I Was in Love with You&quot;, written by Russell. In 2020, Air Supply were listed at number 48 in &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot;″s list of the &quot;50 Greatest Australian Artists of All Time&quot;.

<text>ABC Radio National, known on-air as RN, is an Australia-wide public service broadcasting radio network run by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). From 1947 until 1985, the network was known as ABC Radio 2.

==History==
===1937: Predecessors and beginnings===
From 1928, the National Broadcasting Service, as part of the federal Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department, gradually took over responsibility for all the existing stations that were sponsored by public licence fees (&quot;A&quot; Class licences). The outsourced Australian Broadcasting Company supplied programs from 1929. In 1932 a commission was established, merging the original ABC company and the National Broadcasting Service. It is from this time that Radio National dates as a distinct network within the ABC, in which a system of program relays was developed during the subsequent decades to link stations spread across the nation.

The beginnings of Radio National lie with Sydney radio station 2FC, which aired its first test broadcast on 5 December 1923 and officially went to air on 9 January 1924. 2FC stood for Farmer and Company, the original owner of the station before the ABC bought the station in 1937.

The ABC then rolled out a national network across the country, somewhat similar in nature to the BBC National Programme. The origins of the other stations in the network were:

*3AR Melbourne – 26 January 1924 &quot;Associated Radio Company of Australia&quot;, organised by Esmond Laurence Kiernan and others.
*5CL Adelaide – 20 November 1924 &quot;Central Broadcasters Ltd&quot;.
*7ZL Hobart – 17 December 1924.
*4QG Brisbane – 27 July 1925 &quot;Queensland Government&quot; (operated by the Queensland Radio Service, an agency within the Office of the Chief Secretary).
*6WN Perth – 5 October 1938 &quot;Wanneroo&quot;.
*2CY Canberra – 23 December 1938.
*2NA Newcastle – 20 December 1943.

The first transmitters for 2FC, 5CL and 4QG were made by AWA with power of 5 kW (note that until about 1931 in Australia, transmitter powers were defined in terms of DC input to final amplifier, typically about three times that of the power into the antenna; thus power today would be stated as about 1.7 kW). They used a MT7A valve for the final high power RF stage and a MT7B for the modulator. The power supply was 12,000 volts from three phase power rectified by MR7 valves. 4QG commenced with a 500 Watt transmitter which continued for about 6 months until the 5 kW unit was commissioned.

The radio transmitters for 3AR and 2FC were upgraded to 10 kW in a contract let in 1938 to STC. The transmitters were designed by Charles Strong in London, and were notable in using negative feedback to ensure a high quality flat frequency response.

From 1947 until the mid-1980s, &quot;Radio 2&quot; (as it came to be known) was broadcast to the major metropolitan centres, with a large broadcast footprint in adjacent areas due to the powerful AM transmitters in use. It contained most of the ABC&#x27;s national programming.

The power level of 2FC and 3AR was upgraded to 50 kW in the early 1950s. The transmitters for these were housed in the same building as the radio 1 network. They were manufactured by STC. The final stage contained three parallel 3J/261E air cooled triodes running in class C amplifier at 90% efficiency. These were driven by a class B push-pull modulator with the same type of valves. That of 5CL had to wait until late 1961, when a new joint facility with 5AN was opened at Pimpala.

===1970s–1980s===
In the 1970s, the network&#x27;s program format began to take on a more serious tone, a style which continues to this day. Art critic Peter Timms later remarked that the network is &quot;virtually the only non-print media forum for art in this country&quot;.

In the early 1980s the broadcast footprint was extended with the construction of the first of over 300 regional FM transmitters (including community re-broadcast sites). In 1985, the ABC renamed &quot;Radio 2&quot; as &quot;Radio National&quot;.

===1990s===
Since 1990, all Radio National stations have had the same callsign, &quot;RN&quot;.

As a result of cuts in the 1996–97 budget, Radio National was hit with a reduction of a million dollars in its funding, with a significant impact on programming.

===21st century===

In 2008, controversial programming changes once more raised the issue of funding cuts to the public broadcaster. Presenter Stephen Crittenden leaked confidential programming changes in an unscheduled live broadcast before the start of his show, criticising his superiors. He was suspended for his outburst, and his unscripted comments were cut from Radio National&#x27;s podcast and transcript of the program. Religious commentator Paul Collins on crikey.com subsequently echoed Crittenden&#x27;s fears. Crittenden was reinstated in 2009 as a reporter on &quot;Background Briefing&quot;, after a settlement was reached. However, his program and the other eight programs that had been cancelled or merged were not re-instated that year. The head of ABC Radio, Sue Howard, was dismissed in 2009.

In January 2012 Radio National was rebranded as RN, partly in recognition of the station&#x27;s growing digital audience. RN has also been used as shorthand for the station&#x27;s name by many presenters going back several years. RN&#x27;s tagline, which has changed regularly over the years, was also changed to &quot;Your World Unfolding&quot; to mesh with the station&#x27;s new logo and visual identity.

In 2012 a new Religion and Ethics report was launched, hosted by Andrew West. The Media Report was also relaunched, hosted by broadcaster and former Life Matters host Richard Aedy. The Media Report was, however, cancelled again in 2015.

In late 2016, the new head of the ABC Michelle Guthrie defended the removal of staff and programmes from the Radio National 2017 schedule, with the scope of the new year&#x27;s lineup culled due to budget cuts with consequent staff and programming reductions.

==== 2025 major changes ====

In November 2024, Radio National announced new programmes and schedule designed to relaunch the station in 2025 as &quot;the centre of big conversations and create a space where audiences can expand their worldview while engaging with the world’s best thinkers.&quot; This was the biggest slate of changes and the largest announcement of new programmes since the 2017 upheaval and cuts.

The new programming schedule commenced on January 20, 2025. The station also changed its logo from the previous &#x27;RN&#x27; logo to a new &#x27;Radio National&#x27; logo.

Among the major changes to the station programming included: The return of previous Radio National Breakfast host Fran Kelly with a new news magazine programme at 6p.m. weeknights called the &quot;Radio National Hour&quot; and a revamped &quot;Radio National Breakfast,&quot; broadcast each weekday from the earlier time of 5:30a.m. with Sally Sara as host. 

The new &quot;Breakfast&quot; format now included news presenter Luke Siddham Dundon, Canberra-based political correspondent Melissa Clarke and business correspondent Peter Ryan in addition to Sara. The program was changed to model BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Today programme, with more serious national and international news covered, as well as live crosses to Clarke and Ryan for politics and business coverage throughout the programme. 

As part of the change to the schedule, some long-running programmes were cancelled. Afternoon news magazine programme &quot;RN Drive&quot; was also axed in favour of Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Radio National Hour,&quot; with host Andy Park now hosting the daily afternoon news and current affair show &quot;The World Today&quot;, previously hosted by Sara. 

Economics programme &quot;The Money&quot;, hosted by Richard Aedy, was cancelled and replaced by new programme &quot;The Economy, Stupid&quot; hosted by Peter Martin. Lifestyle and design programme &quot;Blueprint for Living&quot; was discontinued, with host Jonathan Green now hosting a new weekly food programme, &quot;Every Bite&quot;. 

Rural affairs news magazine programme &quot;Australia Wide&quot; (which previously aired at 6:30p.m. weeknights) is no longer broadcast on Radio National, with Kelly&#x27;s programme broadcasting during its previous time slot. &quot;Australia Wide&quot; is still broadcast on ABC Local Radio stations in regional areas outside capital cities.

Other changes to the Radio National schedule in 2025 included: 

* The PM programme is returning to 5p.m. weekdays, made possible the cancellation &quot;RN Drive&quot; which previously aired from 4p.m. to 5:30p.m. weekdays. 
* After &quot;PM&quot;, the specialist programmes that previously aired at 6p.m. are returning to their previous 5.30p.m. slot, including &quot;Global Roaming&quot; on Mondays, &quot;Law Report&quot; on Tuesdays, &quot;Religion and Ethics Report&quot; on Wednesdays, new programs &quot;The Economy, Stupid&quot; on Thursdays and &quot;MediaLand&quot; on Fridays. Previous Friday programme &quot;Download this Show&quot;, with new host Rae Johnston (replacing Marc Fennell), now first airs at 8p.m. each Friday night.
* Visual arts programme &quot;The Art Show&quot; (hosted by Daniel Browning) is halved to 30 minutes on Wednesdays at 10a.m. This is followed by new weekly arts news programme &quot;Arts in 30&quot; (also hosted by Browning) at 10:30a.m.
* A new programme focused on scientific research &quot;Lab Notes&quot; to be hosted by Belinda Smith 
* &quot;TGIF&quot;, previously hosted by Richard Glover (and only airing on ABC Radio Sydney each Friday at 5p.m.), is now also airing on Radio National (on delay) on Friday evenings at 7p.m. with new host Charlie Pickering now broadcasting from Melbourne. The show now also airs on ABC Radio Melbourne live at the same time as Sydney. 
* Hilary Harper (Mondays to Wednesday) and Cassie McCullagh (Thursday to Friday) will broadcast live between midday and 4p.m. each weekday, linking programmes and podcasts as part of an effort to return Radio National to a &quot;live, flow format&quot;, with the live-to-air host interacting with listeners&#x27; text messages and correspondence during the afternoon. This also allows Radio National to air podcasts and programmes that are shorter than 30 minutes, with Harper and McCullagh able to fill air time responding to the audience and content.

Ben Latimer, the ABC&#x27;s Director of Audio told Australian marketing and media industry news website Mumbrella that the 2025 changes was ABC Radio National&#x27;s reaffirming of &quot;its role as Australia’s premier audio gateway, offering audiences a window into the rich tapestry of intellectual and creative life in this country.&quot;

==Description==

Radio National broadcasts national programming in subjects that include news and current affairs, the arts, social issues, science, drama and comedy. Some programs are relayed on Radio Australia, the ABC&#x27;s international broadcasting service which was transmitted on shortwave until January 2017, as well as 24-hour FM stations, local relay stations and live satellite.

All radio programs are available for live streaming over the Internet, and most (excluding drama, poetry and music) as audio-on-demand, or for download as MP3s for at least four weeks after broadcast. Some programs are available as MP3s going back to 2005, when Radio National commenced podcasting.

<text>Bau (cuneiform: 𒀭𒁀𒌑 &quot;dBa-U2&quot;; also romanized as Baba or Babu) was a Mesopotamian goddess. The reading of her name is a subject of debate among researchers, though Bau is considered the conventional spelling today. While initially regarded simply as a life-giving deity, in some cases associated with the creation of mankind, over the course of the third and second millennia BCE she also acquired the role of a healing goddess. She could be described as a divine midwife. In art she could be depicted in the company of waterfowl or scorpions. 

In sources from Lagash and Girsu, Bau&#x27;s husband was the god Ningirsu. Among their children were deities such as Igalim, Shulshaga and Ḫegir. While they could still be regarded as a couple in later sources, from the Old Babylonian period onwards Bau was also viewed as the wife of Zababa, the tutelary god of Kish. Another deity associated with her was her attendant goddess Lammašaga. Most likely for political reasons, Bau also came to be associated, and partially syncretised, with the medicine goddess Ninisina. However, their character was not identical, for example Bau was not associated with dogs and was not invoked against demons in incantations. In the late second millennium BCE she also came to be associated with Gula, and could be equated with her, though texts where they are two separate goddesses are known too. In one case, Bau is described as the deity who bestowed Gula&#x27;s position upon her.

The earliest evidence indicates that Bau&#x27;s initial cult center was Girsu, and that early on she also came to be worshipped in Lagash. Multiple kings of this city left behind inscriptions which mention her, and some of them, for example Uru&#x27;inimgina, referred to her as their divine mother. She is also attested in the theophoric names of many ordinary people. While the area where she was initially worshipped declined in the Old Babylonian period, she was transferred to Kish, and continued to be venerated there as late as in the Neo-Babylonian period. She is also attested in texts from Uruk dating to the Seleucid period.

==Name==
Bau is considered the conventional romanization today. However, it has been historically been a subject of debate in Assyriology, and various other possibilities have been proposed, including Baba, Bawu and Babu. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the reading of the name, some experts favor romanizing it as BaU or Ba-U2, including Manuel Ceccarelli, Jeremiah Peterson, Julia M. Asher-Greve and Joan Goodnick Westenholz. While &quot;Baba&quot; is a common romanization in publications from the twentienth century, the evidence both in favor and against it is inconclusive. Edmond Sollberger considered &quot;Bawa&quot; to be the original formof the name, with &quot;Baba&quot; being a latter pronunciation, similar to the shift from Huwawa to Humbaba. Maurice Lambert assumed Baba was the Akkadian reading and argued that in scholarship it should be only employed in discussion of Akkadian sources. Giovani Marchesi notes that it is not certain if the phonetic spelling &quot;Baba&quot; found in a few Old Akkadian texts corresponds to this goddess or another deity, though he remarks it does seem that &quot;Baba&quot; and &quot;Bau&quot; were interchangeable in the writing of theophoric names, for example in the case of the legendary queen Kubaba/Ku-Bau. He concludes that Bau was most likely the original pronunciation at the time when the orthography of the name was standardized in the third millennium BCE. Gonzalo Rubio disagrees with Marchesi&#x27;s conclusions and argues that the reading Baba would match the structure of a number of other names of Mesopotamian deities with no clear Sumerian or Semitic etymologies, such as Alala, Bunene or Zababa. However, Ryan D. Winters states that the fact the name was written phonetically and not logographically, with two different symbols, makes it implausible it was originally pronounced as Baba, a reduplication of a single syllable. Christopher Metcalf notes that the reading &quot;Bau&quot; is also supported by the attestations of the dative form &quot;dBa-U2-ur2&quot;.

The meaning of Bau&#x27;s name is unknown. Thorkild Jacobsen&#x27;s proposal that it was &quot;an imitation of dog&#x27;s bark, as English &#x27;bowwow&#x27;&quot; is regarded as erroneous today, as unlike other healing goddesses (Gula, Ninisina, Nintinugga and Ninkarrak) Bau was not associated with dogs.

==Character and iconography==
The earliest sources represent Bau as a &quot;life-giving&quot; and &quot;motherly&quot; deity. A hymn from the reign of Ishme-Dagan preserves a tradition according to which she was believed to be the mother of mankind. While not a healing goddess at first, Bau acquired traits of this class of deities at some point in the third millennium BCE. In sources from the third millennium BCE Bau is the only goddess belonging to this group referred to as an &quot;asû&quot;, &quot;physician&quot;. At the same time, there is no evidence that physicians were involved in her cult, in contrast with the cults of Gula, Ninisina and Nintinugga. This might indicate her healing role was associated with domestic religious practices. As a healing goddess Bau was associated with midwifery. She could be described as &quot;(ama) arḫuš&quot;, &quot;merciful (mother)&quot;. It has been proposed that this epithet reflected &quot;the knowledge of the female body,&quot; and that it designated deities bearing it as midwives. A hymn praising Bau as a divine midwife was composed to celebrate the birth of the child of queen Kubatum, wife of Shu-Sin. 

Bau was also regarded as a goddess of abundance, and as such was depicted with a vase with flowing streams of water in art. Furthermore, she was believed to be capable of mediating with other deities on behalf of supplicants. 

A depiction of Bau accompanied by a snake is known from a seal, and according to Julia M. Asher-Greve might indicate this animal was perceived as her symbol in the role of a healing deity. This interpretation has been questioned by Irene Sibbing-Plantholt, who points out that while the owner of the seal, a certain Ninkalla, was a midwife, there is no other evidence for the association between Bau and snakes, and the animal therefore might fulfill a general apotropaic role. In other contexts, presumably pertaining to her role as a wife or mother, Bau could be depicted with scorpions (associated with marriage), swans or miscellaneous waterfowl. The various symbols assigned to her indicate that she was a multifaceted deity with a fluid sphere of influence. However, identifying depictions of Bau in art postdating the end of the third millennium BCE is difficult.

== Associations with other deities ==
Bau&#x27;s father was An, as already attested in an inscription of Gudea. She was described as his firstborn daughter sometimes. According to Ryan D. Winters in the third millennium BCE in Lagash Gatumdug was regarded as Bau&#x27;s mother. However, this role could also be fulfilled in Abba or Abau (the latter form can also be romanized as Ababa; the romanization of the name is uncertain similarly as in the case of Bau), attested in the &quot;Lamentation over the Destruction of Ur&quot; and in the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;. In the latter source both Abau and Gatumdug appear, but only the former is described as Bau&#x27;s mother (tablet V, line 58), while the latter is instead equated with Bau (tablet V, line 60). Another deity named Abau, known from &quot;An = Anum&quot; passage and first millennium BCE lamentations, was instead male and could be described as a son of Bau. In &quot;An = Anum&quot; he appears separately from Bau and is described as the husband of Gula (tablet V, line 52). This deity is presumed to be identical with Abu from the myth of &quot;Enki and Ninhursag&quot;.

Bau&#x27;s husband was initially Ningirsu. One of the few known reliefs showing a god with his wife sitting in his lap is most likely a depiction of this couple from the reign of Gudea (another similar one is instead interpreted as a depiction of Nanna and Ningal from the reign of Ur-Namma). Such images were meant to highlight that the divine couples, depicted as loving spouses, act in unison, and that the corresponding kings had a special relation to them. References to Bau and Ningirsu as a couple are also known from later sources, for example two curse formulas inscribed on &quot;kudurru&quot; (boundary stones). In sources from Lagash, the siblings Igalim and Shulshaga were regarded as their sons. Furthermore, an inscription of Gudea labels the goddess Ḫegir as their daughter. The composition preserved on the Gudea cylinders states she was a member of a group referred to as &quot;the seven &quot;lukur&quot; priestesses of Ningirsu&quot; or &quot;the septuplets of Bau&quot;. Another goddess from this group, Urnunta-ea, could be addressed as a daughter of Bau and Ningirsu as early as during the reigns of Urukagina and Ur-Ningirsu I, though she is also attested as a child of Lisin (&quot;An = Anum&quot; tablet II, line 77). Furthermore, Ryan D. Winters suggests that the deity Zurmuzarmu, who occurs in &quot;An = Anum&quot; (tablet II, line 105) in a context indicating association with Kesh, is a later reflection of the names of two other of the seven &quot;lukur&quot;, Zurmu and Zarmu. It is possible that this reflects a degree of interchange between the circles of deities regarded as members of Bau&#x27;s court and those associated with the local pantheon of Kesh.

In Kish, where Bau was introduced in the Old Babylonian period, she was regarded as the spouse of Zababa, a local war god. An early reference to Bau and Zababa as a couple is known from the &quot;Lament for Sumer and Ur&quot;. Joan Goodnick Westenholz argues that initially Zababa was the husband of Ishtar of Kish (regarded as separate from Ishtar of Uruk), but after the Old Babylonian period she was replaced in the role of his spouse by Bau, though she continued to be worshiped independently. However, as pointed out by Ryan D. Winters, while this assumption can be found in other modern publications as well, no primary sources identify Zababa and Ishtar of Kish as spouses; he states that even if a connection other than sharing a cult center existed between them, there is no certainty it was marital. In &quot;An = Anum&quot;, Bau occurs both as the wife of Zababa (tablet V, line 48) and Ningirsu (tablet V, line 56). Winters notes that at the time of this text s composition pairing her with Ningirsu represented a stronger tradition. However, references to her and Zababa as a couple are common from the Middle Babylonian period onward. They appear together in various religious texts, including the incantation series &quot;Šurpu&quot;, a hymn to Nanaya, and various compositions from the north of Babylonia. The tradition presenting them as a couple is also known from Assyrian sources, for example from a treaty of Ashur-nirari V.

An association between Bau and Nergal is attested in Old Babylonian sources from Ur and in a single text from Larsa.

Bau&#x27;s divine vizier (sukkal) was the goddess Lammašaga, &quot;good guardian angel (lamma)&quot;, &quot;lamma&quot; being a class of tutelary and intercessory minor goddesses in Mesopotamian religion. She had a temple of her own in Lagash, and hymns dedicated to her are known from the curriculum of scribal schools. In the past, attempts were sometimes made to prove was a manifestation of Bau rather than a separate goddess, but this view is no longer considered plausible. A hymn formerly believed to be a praise of Bau, while sometimes referred to as &quot;Bau A&quot; according to the ETCSL naming system, has been subsequently identified as a composition dedicated to Lammašaga instead. Bau herself was possibly sometimes addressed as a &quot;lamma&quot; in Lagash. In a handful of inscriptions, Bau&#x27;s mother, left nameless in them, is also designated as such a deity. Furthermoe, in An = Anum a goddess named Lamma-Bau is described as Bau&#x27;s daughter (tablet V, line 186).

===Bau and medicine goddesses===
A degree of syncretism occurred between Bau and Ninisina, and the former is explained as the name of the latter used in Girsu in the composition &quot;Ninisina and the Gods&quot;. A hymn composed on behalf of Ishme-Dagan describes Bau with epithets which normally belonged to Ninisina. It is possible that the development of a connection between these goddesses was politically motivated and was supposed to help the kings of Isin with posing as rightful successors of earlier influential dynasties. According to Manuel Ceccarelli it developed in parallel with the connection between their respective husbands, Ningirsu and Pabilsag. The character of Bau and Ninisina was however not identical, for example the former typically does not appear in incantations and was not invoked as an opponent of demons, unlike the latter. Bau&#x27;s lack of association with dogs, which sets her apart from other healing goddesses, might be related to this difference.

Another medicine goddess associated with Bau was Gula, though they were not closely connected with each other until the late second millennium BCE. They were likely regarded as analogous in the Middle Assyrian period, with examples including the interchangeable use of their names in colophons and direct equation in a local Assurian recension of the Weidner god list, but they were not always viewed as identical. Irene Sibbing-Plantholt suggests that the title &quot;Bau ša qēreb Aššur&quot; might have been used to differentiate Bau as a name of Gula and Bau as an independent goddess. In the &quot;Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi&quot;, composed at some point between 1400 and 700 BCE, Bau is listed as one of the names of the eponymous goddess. This composition, despite equating various goddesses with Gula, nonetheless preserves information about the individual character of each of them. The section dedicated to Bau highlights her role as a life-giving deity. However, a late Babylonian incantation states that Gula was &quot;exalted by the command of Bau&quot;, which indicates they were viewed as separate. They also occur separately from each other in sources pertaining to a festival held in Uruk in the first millennium BCE. Bau&#x27;s association with Zababa was also exclusive to her.

==Worship==
===Third millennium BCE===
While the oldest attestations of Bau come from scribal school texts from Shuruppak from the Early Dynastic period, her original cult center was Girsu. Her main shrine bore the ceremonial name Egalgasu, &quot;house filled with counsel&quot;, and was a part of the Etarsirsir, a temple dedicated to her located in the Uru-ku, the &quot;sacred quarter&quot; of the city. References to this house of worship are already known from the reign of Ur-Nanshe. Bau was also worshiped in the Eninnu, which was primarily a temple of Ningirsu. The name Etarsirsir also referred to Bau&#x27;s temple in the city of Lagash, though she was not yet worshiped there in the Early Dynastic period. It has been suggested that this might indicate she was initially not a separate goddess, but a secondary name of Lagashite Gatumdug, but this explanation is not considered plausible. Attested members of the staff of Bau&#x27;s temples from the Early Dynastic period include various types of clergy (for example &quot;gudu&quot; and &quot;gala&quot;); temple administrators (&quot;sanga&quot;); writers (&quot;dub-sar&quot;); musicians (&quot;nar&quot;); housekeepers (&quot;agrig&quot;); various artisans; shepherds; fishermen; and more. Multiple kings of Lagash dedicated votive offerings to Bau, with particularly many being known from the reign of Uru&#x27;inimgina. Some of the Lagashite rulers, including him, as well as Eanatum and Lugalanda, referred to Bau as their divine mother, though sometimes this role was fulfilled by Gatumdug instead, for example in the case of Enanatum I and Enmetena. Bau&#x27;s association with kings extended to the cult of deceased rulers as well. She appears frequently in theophoric names from Lagash. Examples include Bau-alša (&quot;Bau shows mercy&quot;), Bau-amadari (&quot;Bau is the eternal mother&quot;), Bau-dingirmu (&quot;Bau is my deity&quot;), Bau-gimabaša (&quot;Who is merciful like Bau?&quot;), Bau-ikuš (&quot;Bau takes care&quot;), Bau-menmu (&quot;Bau is my crown&quot;), Bau-umu (&quot;Bau is my light&quot;), Gan-Bau (&quot;servant of Bau&quot;; the first element is feminine), Geme-Bau (&quot;maid of Bau&quot;), Lu-Bau (&quot;man of Bau&quot;), and more.

Bau&#x27;s importance grew further during the reign of the Second Dynasty of Lagash ( 2230-2110 BCE) due to her association with Ningirsu. Gudea elevated her to a rank equal with him, and referred to her as the &quot;queen who decides the destiny in Girsu&quot;. This reform made her the highest ranking goddess of the local pantheon of Lagash, which was previously the position of Nanshe. During the subsequent reign of the Third Dynasty of Ur, Bau was the second most notable goddess worshiped chiefly in association with her respective husband after Ninlil. The highest cultic official of Bau in the province of Lagash, and as a result one of the most powerful political figures in it was an &quot;ereš-dingir&quot; priestess. One of the holders of this office was a certain Geme-Lamma, who is known from inscription on a number of seals. While servants and scribes are depicted led by minor goddesses to meet with Bau on seals, she was depicted interacting with the goddess directly. In the same period Bau came to be worshiped in Nippur, though neither she not her husband Ningirsu were major members of the local pantheon. According to Walther Sallaberger, she received offerings in the Ešumša, the temple of Ninurta.

===Later attestations===
Kings from the dynasty of Isin, in particular Ishme-Dagan, showed interest in the cult of Bau, though she was not introduced to the pantheon of Isin itself, and in documents from it she only appears in theophoric names. Evidence for the worship of Bau from the Old Babylonian period is scarce. In Ur she is only attested near its end, always in association with Nergal. While the original Lagashite cult of Bau declined alongside the city (a situation analogous to that of Ningirsu as an independent deity, as well as other southern deities such as Shara and Nanshe), she continued to be worshiped in Kish in northern Babylonia. Old Babylonian evidence for the presence of her worshipers in this city includes a record from the reign of Ammi-Ditana which mentions a woman serving as a courtyard purifier (&quot;kisalluḫḫatum&quot;) of this goddess, and a seal from Hammurabi&#x27;s time whose owner referred to herself as a servant of Zababa and Bau. She remained a major goddess of that city as late as the Neo-Babylonian period. An inscription from the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II mentions the rebuilding of the local temple Edubba for both the city god, Zababa, and for Bau. A cella dedicated to her bore the name Egalgasu, which originally referred to her shrine in Girsu. 

Elsewhere in the Middle Babylonian period and beyond, Bau retained a degree of popularity, and next to Ishtar and Gula she was the most commonly invoked goddess in theophoric names. One historically notable example is Bau-asītu, a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar II. In Babylon, &quot;Bau of Kish&quot; was celebrated during certain festivals in the temple of Gula. According to Andrew R. George, the temple Eulšarmešudu, &quot;house of jubilation and perfect &quot;me&quot;&quot;, possibly located in Der and known from an unpublished hymn, might have been dedicated to Bau. Her cult is also attested in Assyria, and a temple dedicated jointly to her and Zababa existed in Assur.

While Bau was not yet worshiped in Uruk in the Neo-Babylonian period, she is mentioned in a text describing the procession of deities who took part in the &quot;akītu&quot; festival which was celebrated in this city in the Seleucid period. She also occurs in a single theophoric name from this location.

<text>In Christianity, an anchorite or anchoret (female: anchoress; ) is someone who, for religious reasons, withdraws from secular society to be able to lead an intensely prayer-oriented, ascetic, or Eucharist-focused life. Anchorites are frequently considered to be a type of hermit, but unlike hermits, they were required to take a vow of stability of place, opting for permanent enclosure in cells often attached to churches. Also unlike hermits, anchorites were subject to a religious rite of consecration that closely resembled the funeral rite, following which they would be considered dead to the world and a type of living saint. Anchorites had a certain autonomy, as they did not answer to any ecclesiastical authority apart from bishops.

The anchoritic life is one of the earliest forms of Christian monasticism. In the Catholic Church, heremitic life is one of the forms of consecrated life. In medieval England, the earliest recorded anchorites lived in the 11th century. Their highest number—around 200 anchorites—was recorded in the 13th century.

From the 12th to the 16th centuries, female anchorites consistently outnumbered their male counterparts, sometimes by as many as four to one in the 13th century. This ratio eventually dropped to two to one in the 15th century. The sex of a high number of anchorites, however, is not recorded for these periods.

Between 1536 and 1539, the dissolution of the monasteries ordered by Henry VIII of England effectively brought the anchorite tradition to an end in England.

== Anchoritic life ==
The anchoritic life became widespread during the early and high Middle Ages. Examples of the dwellings of anchorites and anchoresses survive, a large number of which are in England. They tended to be a simple cell (also called &quot;anchorhold&quot;) built against one of the walls of the local village church. 

In Germanic-speaking areas, from at least the tenth century it was customary for the bishop to say the Office of the Dead as the anchorite entered their cell, to signify the anchorite&#x27;s death to the world and rebirth to a spiritual life of solitary communion with God and the angels. Sometimes, if the anchorite was walled up inside the cell, the bishop would put his seal upon the wall to stamp it with his authority. Some anchorites, however, freely moved between their cells and the adjoining churches.

Most anchoritic anchorholds were small, perhaps at most square, with three windows. Viewing the altar, hearing Mass, and receiving the Eucharist were possible through one small, shuttered window in the common wall facing the sanctuary, called a &quot;hagioscope&quot; or &quot;squint&quot;. Anchorites provided spiritual advice and counsel to visitors through these windows, gaining a reputation for wisdom. Another small window allowed access to those who saw to the anchorite&#x27;s physical needs. A third window, often facing the street but covered with translucent cloth, allowed light into the cell.

Jerome J. McGann, Anne Lake Prescott, Barry V. Qualls, Claire Waters

Anchorites committed to a life of uncompromising enclosure. Those who considered leaving possibly believed their souls might be damned for spiritual dereliction. Some refused to leave their cells even when pirates or looters were pillaging their towns and consequently burned to death when the church was torched. They ate frugal meals, spending their days both in contemplative prayer and interceding on behalf of others. Their body waste was managed using a chamber pot. 

Some anchorholds had a few small rooms or attached gardens. Servants tended to the basic needs of anchorites, providing food and water and removing waste. Julian of Norwich, for example, is known to have had several maidservants, among them Sara and Alice. Aelred of Rievaulx wrote an anchorite rule book, , for his recluse sister titled &quot;De Institutione Inclusarum&quot;. In it, he suggested keeping no housemates other than an older woman, to act as companion and doorkeeper, and a young maid as domestic servant.

The anchorhold was the physical location wherein the anchorite could embark on a journey toward union with God. It also provided a spiritual and geographic focus for people from the wider society seeking spiritual advice and guidance. Though set apart from the community by stone walls and specific spiritual precepts, the anchorite lay at the very centre of the community. The anchorhold has been called a communal &quot;womb&quot; from which would emerge an idealised sense of a community&#x27;s reborn potential as Christians and as human subjects.

== Influential texts ==
An idea of their daily routine can be gleaned from an anchoritic rule. The most widely known today is the early 13th-century text known as &quot;Ancrene Wisse&quot;. Another, less widely known, example is the rule known as &quot;De Institutione Inclusarum&quot; written in the 12th century, around 1160–1162, by Aelred of Rievaulx for his sister. It is estimated that the daily set devotions detailed in &quot;Ancrene Wisse&quot; would take some four hours, on top of which anchoresses would listen to services in the church and engage in their own private prayers and devotional reading.

Richard Rolle, an English hermit and mystic, wrote one of the most influential guide books regarding the life of an anchoress. His book &quot;The Form of Living&quot; was addressed to a young anchoress named Margaret Kirkby who was responsible for preserving his texts. Her connection to the town of Hampole has been commonly associated with Rolle. He is sometimes referred to as &#x27;Richard Rolle of Hampole&#x27; despite a lack of conclusive evidence that Rolle was ever in the small village.

== Notable anchorites ==
The earliest recorded anchorites lived in the third century AD. Saint Anthony the Anchorite (251–356), also known as &quot;Anthony of the Desert&quot;, has a traditional reputation as Christianity&#x27;s &quot;Father of Monasticism&quot;.
Hilarion (Gaza, 291 – Cyprus, 371) was known as the founder of anchoritic life in Palestine.

The anchoritic life proved popular in England, where women outnumbered men in the ranks of the anchorites, especially in the 13th century. Written evidence supports the existence of 780 anchorites on 600 sites between 1100 and 1539, when the Dissolution of the Monasteries ordered by Henry VIII brought anchoritism in England to an end. However, the lack of a consistent registration system for anchorites suggests there may have been substantially more. English anchorholds can still be seen at Chester-le-Street in County Durham and at Hartlip in Kent.

* Bede records that prior to a conference in 602 with Augustine of Canterbury, British churchmen consulted an anchorite about whether to abandon their Celtic Christian traditions for the Roman practices which Augustine was seeking to introduce.
* Toward the end of the seventh century, Guthlac of Crowland, related to the royal family of Mercia, withdrew from the monastery at Repton to an island in the Lincolnshire Fens where he lived for some 15–20 years.
* Eve of Wilton (died &quot;c&quot;.1125) was an English anchoress.
* Wulfric of Haselbury (died 1154) was enclosed as an anchorite in a cell built against the church in his village of Haselbury Plucknett in Somerset.
* Christine Carpenter, who submitted a petition in 1329 and was granted permission to become the anchoress of Shere Church, also known as the Church of St. James, in the Borough of Guildford, received her food and drink through a metal grating on the outside wall. In the interior of the church, a quatrefoil through which she could receive the Eucharist and a hagioscope for her use for prayer and reflection were cut out of the wall. Although she left her cell, in 1332 she applied for—and was granted—permission to be re-enclosed.
* Katherine of Ledbury, anchorite at Ledbury, Herefordshire, in the early 14th century.
* Margaret Kirkby (possibly 1322 to ), an anchoress at Hampole, for whom Richard Rolle wrote his vernacular guide &quot;The Form of Living&quot;.
* In 1346, an unnamed anchorite scribe translated Latin texts into Welsh, producing what is today known as &quot;Book of the Anchorite of Llanddewibrefi&quot;.
* Walter Hilton ( 1340/1345 – 1396) composed the first book of his &quot;Scale of Perfection&quot; for an unnamed enclosed woman.
* Julian of Norwich (died after 1416) wrote the mystic text &quot;Revelations of Divine Love&quot;, which made a permanent contribution to Christian spirituality. Her cell, attached to St Julian&#x27;s Church, Norwich, was destroyed during the Dissolution, and the church itself was gutted by bombing in the Second World War, but afterwards rebuilt. On the site of the cell is a modern shrine to Julian.
* Patrick Begley (or Beglin) was an Irish anchorite who lived in a cell at Fore Abbey in the 17th century.
* Nazarena of Jesus was an American who felt called to become an anchorite and entered the Camaldolese Abbey of Sant&#x27;Antimo in Rome in 1945, remaining there until her death in 1990.

Other anchorites included Calogerus the Anchorite (c. 466 – 561), Cyriacus the Anchorite (448–557) and Suster Bertken (1426–1514).

<text>Edwin Brienen (born June 15, 1971 in Alkmaar, Netherlands) is a Dutch film director, actor, producer, journalist and radio moderator. In German press he&#x27;s often called &#x27;the Dutch Fassbinder&#x27; because of the high production-level and style of his films. He lives in Berlin, Germany.

==Biography==
After studying philosophy and psychology, Edwin Brienen embarked on a career as a radio host at the age of 22. His programs for Dutch broadcasting association VPRO attracted a nationwide following. On television he starred in the underground series &quot;Ultra Vista!&quot;. For television he directed the shows &quot;Buch, Burgers &amp; Buitenlui&quot; and &quot;Hoe Hoort het Eigenlijk?&quot; with Theo van Gogh. In 2001, he wrote, directed, and edited his debut feature film &quot;Terrorama!&quot;, a dark story about a group of dispirited people who seek out &#x27;psychological freedom&#x27; by committing an act of terror. A year later, Brienen returned to VPRO and, in September 2001, he created a series about the New York underground scene.

Brienen&#x27;s fourth feature, &quot;Both Ends Burning&quot;, premiered during the Brienen Festival in 14 Dutch theaters in January 2005. The film probes the underbelly of relationships and is suffused with an atmosphere reminiscent of French cinema of the &#x27;70s but also contains bone-chilling moments that recall &quot;Carrie&quot; and &quot;Repulsion&quot;. In 2005, Arte TV broadcast a documentary about Brienen in which they compared his work and intensity with Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.

&quot;Last Performance&quot; (2006) and &quot;Revision – Apocalypse II&quot; (2009) both premiere at the Netherlands Film Festival in Utrecht. In 2008, Brienen works together with Austrian actor Erwin Leder known from the 1981 classic &quot;Das Boot&quot; as directed by Wolfgang Petersen. The result is called &quot;L&#x27;amour toujours&quot; and Leder plays an obsessed director that resembles Brienen. Two German spoken films are released in 2009 and 2011: &quot;Viva Europa!&quot; about the revolutions of 1989 and &quot;Lena Wants to Know Once and For All&quot;, a melancholic comedy about the search for love.

In October 2012, the Lausanne Underground Film and Music Festival in Switzerland honoured Brienen by presenting a retrospective of his films, including the world premiere of &quot;Exploitation&quot;.

December 2016 saw the premiere of Brienen’s 15th feature film, &quot;God&quot;. It’s a story about striptease dancer Alice, whose boyfriend is hunted by a corrupt political regime after leaking secret government documents. Stuck in a web of intrigue and violent threats, a nun confronts Alice with her stubborn dogmatism. The film got nominated for “best narrative feature” at the Great Lakes Film Festival in 2017. That same year, the prestigious Centrum Filmowe Kraków presented an Edwin Brienen film retrospective. Thereafter, Brienen took two years off to write on his debut novel. In 2020 he returned with a short film, &quot;Accidents Never Happen in a Perfect World&quot;, shot during the pandemic lockdown.

<text>Terrorama! (2001) is the first feature film of Dutch director Edwin Brienen. In 2002 &quot;Terrorama!&quot; won the award for &quot;Best film&quot; at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival and &quot;best leading actress&quot; at the Toronto Independent Film Festival (Esther Eva Verkaaik).

==Plot==
The film tells the story of six mental cases, trying to get rid of society&#x27;s norms and values by kidnapping Gerard van Dongen, a well-known TV host. During an improvised TV show, the terrorists confront this Van Dongen with their darkest thoughts and emotions, resulting in violent excesses and extreme sexual behaviour.

==UK release==
Salvation Group bought the UK rights for the film in 2003. A DVD was scheduled for release on August 4, 2003, however was pulled back because of BBFC restrictions. After the killing of Theo van Gogh, Salvation decided to cut the controversial scene with Van Gogh reading from the Koran. The censored version of the film was set to release on June 11, 2007, but was pulled back again for reasons unknown.

<text>Exmoor is loosely defined as an area of hilly open moorland in west Somerset and north Devon in South West England. It is named after the River Exe, the source of which is situated in the centre of the area, two miles north-west of Simonsbath. Exmoor is more precisely defined as the area of the former ancient royal hunting forest, also called Exmoor, which was officially surveyed 1815–1818 as in extent. The moor has given its name to a National Park, which includes the Brendon Hills, the East Lyn Valley, the Vale of Porlock and of the Bristol Channel coast. The total area of the Exmoor National Park is , of which 71% is in Somerset and 29% in Devon.

The upland area is underlain by sedimentary rocks dating from the Devonian and early Carboniferous periods with Triassic and Jurassic age rocks on lower slopes. Where these reach the coast, cliffs are formed which are cut with ravines and waterfalls. It was recognised as a heritage coast in 1991. The highest point on Exmoor is Dunkery Beacon; at it is also the highest point in Somerset. The terrain supports lowland heath communities, ancient woodland and blanket mire which provide habitats for scarce flora and fauna. There have also been reports of the Beast of Exmoor, a cryptozoological cat roaming Exmoor. Several areas have been designated as Nature Conservation Review and Geological Conservation Review sites.

There is evidence of human occupation from the Mesolithic. This developed for agriculture and extraction of mineral ores into the Bronze and Iron Ages. The remains of standing stones, cairns and bridges can still be identified. The royal forest was granted a charter in the 13th century, however foresters who managed the area were identified in the Domesday Book. In the Middle Ages sheep farming was common with a system of agistment licensing the grazing of livestock as the Inclosure Acts divided up the land. The area is now used for a range of recreational purposes.

==National character area==
Exmoor has been designated as a national character area (No. 145) by Natural England, the public body responsible for England&#x27;s natural environment. Neighbouring natural regions include The Culm to the southwest, the Devon Redlands to the south and the Vale of Taunton and Quantock Fringes to the east.

==Exmoor National Park==
Exmoor was designated a National Park in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. The Exmoor National Park is primarily an upland area with a dispersed population living mainly in small villages and hamlets. The largest settlements are Porlock, Dulverton, Lynton, and Lynmouth, which together contain almost 40 per cent of the park&#x27;s population. Lynton and Lynmouth are combined into one parish and are connected by the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway.

Exmoor was once a royal forest and hunting ground, covering , which was sold off in 1818. Several areas within the Exmoor National Park have been declared Sites of Special Scientific Interest due to their flora and fauna. This title earns the site some legal protection from development, damage and neglect. In 1993 an environmentally sensitive area was established within Exmoor. It is known as a perfect place for stargazing. In 2011, it was designated Europe&#x27;s first International Dark Sky Reserve by the International Dark-Sky Association.

==Geology==

Exmoor is an upland area formed almost exclusively from sedimentary rocks dating from the Devonian and early Carboniferous periods. The name of the geological period and system, &#x27;Devonian&#x27;, comes from Devon, as rocks of that age were first studied and described here. With the exception of a suite of Triassic and Jurassic age rocks forming the lower ground between Porlock and Timberscombe and from Minehead to Yarde (within Exmoor National Park but peripheral to the moor itself), all of the solid rocks of Exmoor are assigned to the Exmoor Group, which comprises a mix of gritstones, sandstones, slates, shales, limestone, siltstones and mudstones. Quartz and iron mineralisation can be detected in outcrops and subsoil. The Glenthorne area demonstrates the Trentishoe Member (formerly &#x27;Formation&#x27;) of the Hangman Sandstone Formation (formerly &#x27;Group&#x27;). The Hangman Sandstone represents the Middle Devonian sequence of North Devon and Somerset. These unusual freshwater deposits in the Hangman Grits were mainly formed in desert conditions. As this area of Britain was not subject to glaciation, the plateau remains as a remarkably old landform. The bedrock and more recent superficial deposits are covered in part by moorland which is supported by wet, acid soil.

==Geography==
===Coastline===

Exmoor has of coastline. The highest sea cliff on mainland Britain (if a cliff is defined as having a slope greater than 60 degrees) is Great Hangman near Combe Martin at high, with a cliff face of . Its sister cliff is the Little Hangman, which marks the edge of Exmoor. The coastal hills reach a maximum height of at Culbone Hill.

Exmoor&#x27;s woodlands sometimes reach the shoreline, especially between Porlock and Foreland Point, where they form the single longest stretch of coastal woodland in England and Wales. The Exmoor Coastal Heaths have been recognised as a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the diversity of plant species present.

The scenery of rocky headlands, ravines, waterfalls and towering cliffs gained the Exmoor coast recognition as a heritage coast in 1991. With its huge waterfalls and caves, this dramatic coastline has become an adventure playground for both climbers and explorers. The cliffs provide one of the longest and most isolated seacliff traverses in the UK. The South West Coast Path, at the longest National Trail in England and Wales, starts at Minehead and runs along all of Exmoor&#x27;s coast. There are small harbours at Lynmouth, Porlock Weir and Combe Martin. Once crucial to coastal trade, the harbours are now primarily used for pleasure; individually owned sailing boats and non-commercial fishing boats are often found in the harbours. The Valley of Rocks beyond Lynton is a deep dry valley that runs parallel to the nearby sea and is capped on the seaward side by large rocks, and Sexton&#x27;s Burrows forms a natural breakwater to the harbour of Watermouth Bay on the coast.

===Rivers===

The high ground forms the catchment area for numerous rivers and streams. There are about of named rivers on Exmoor. The River Exe, after which Exmoor is named, rises at Exe Head near the village of Simonsbath, close to the Bristol Channel coast, but flows more or less directly due south, so that most of its length lies in Devon. It reaches the sea at a substantial ria (estuary) on the south (English Channel) coast of Devon. It has several tributaries which arise on Exmoor. The River Barle runs from northern Exmoor to join the River Exe at Exebridge, Devon. The river and the Barle Valley are both designated as biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Another tributary, the River Haddeo, flows from the Wimbleball Lake.

Most other rivers arising on Exmoor flow north to the Bristol Channel. These include the River Heddon, which runs along the western edges of Exmoor, reaching the North Devon coast at Heddon&#x27;s Mouth, and the East and West Lyn rivers, which meet at Watersmeet immediately east of Lynmouth. Hoar Oak Water is a moorland tributary of the East Lyn River which also has its confluence there. The River Horner, which is also known as Horner Water, rises near Luccombe and flows into Porlock Bay near Hurlstone Point. The River Mole arises on the south-western flanks of Exmoor and is the major tributary of the River Taw, which itself flows northward from Dartmoor. Badgworthy Water is one of the small rivers running north to the coast and is associated with the Lorna Doone legends.

==Climate==

Along with the rest of South West England, Exmoor has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The mean annual temperature at Simonsbath is with a seasonal and diurnal variation, but due to the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the UK. January is the coldest month, with mean minimum temperatures between . July and August are the warmest months in the region, with mean daily maxima around . In general, December is the month with the least sunshine and June the month with the most sun. The south-west of England has a favoured location with regard to the Azores high pressure when it extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK, particularly in summer.

Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduce the amount of sunshine that reaches the park. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection, caused by the sun heating the land surface more than the sea, sometimes forms rain clouds and at that time of year a large proportion of the rainfall comes from showers and thunderstorms. Annual precipitation varies from in the east of the park to over at The Chains. However, in the 24 hours of 16 August 1952, more than of rain fell at The Chains. This rainfall, which followed an exceptionally wet summer, led to disastrous flooding in Lynmouth with 34 dead and extensive damage to the small town.

Snowfall is very variable from year to year and ranges from 23 days on the high moors to about 6 on coastal areas. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest winds. The wind comes mostly from the south-west.

There are two Met Office Weather stations recording climate data within Exmoor: Liscombe and Nettlecombe.

==History==
There is evidence of occupation of the area by people from Mesolithic times onward. In the Neolithic period, people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunters and as gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make metal tools, weapons, containers and ornaments started in the late Neolithic, and continued into the Bronze and Iron Ages. An earthen ring at Parracombe is believed to be a Neolithic henge dating from 5000–4000 BC, and Cow Castle, which is where White Water meets the River Barle, is an Iron Age fort at the top of a conical hill.

Tarr Steps are a prehistoric ( 1000 BC) clapper bridge across the River Barle, about south-east of Withypool and north-west of Dulverton. The stone slabs weigh up to 5 tonnes apiece, and the bridge has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building, to recognise its special architectural, historical or cultural significance. There is little evidence of Roman occupation apart from two fortlets on the coast. Lanacombe is the site of several standing stones and cairns which have been scheduled as ancient monuments. The stone settings are between and high. A series of Bronze Age stone cairns are closely associated with the standing stones.

Holwell Castle, at Parracombe, was a Norman motte-and-bailey castle built to guard the junction of the east–west and north–south trade routes, enabling movement of people and goods and the growth of the population. Alternative explanations for its construction suggest it may have been constructed to obtain taxes at the River Heddon bridging place, or to protect and supervise silver mining in the area around Combe Martin. It was in diameter and high above the bottom of a rock cut ditch which is deep. It was built, in the late 11th or early 12th century. The earthworks of the castle are still clearly visible from a nearby footpath, but there is no public access to them.

===Establishment of royal forest===

According to the late 13th-century Hundred Rolls, King Henry II of England (d. 1189) gave William of Wrotham the office of steward of Exmoor. The terms steward, warden and forester appear to be synonymous for the king&#x27;s chief officer of the royal forest.

===Wardens===

The first recorded wardens were Dodo, Almer &amp; Godric who were named in the Domesday Book (1086) as &quot;foresters of Widepolla&quot;, Withypool having been the ancient capital of the forest. The family of Denys were associated with Ilchester and &quot;Petherton&quot;. William of Wrotham, who died in 1217, was steward of the forests of Exmoor and North Petherton, Somerset. Walter and Robert were named as foresters of Exmoor when they witnessed an early 13th-century grant to Forde Abbey. In 1276 the jurors of Brushford manor made a complaint about John de Camera in the Court of Exchequer in which he was described as forester of Exmoor.

William Lucar of &quot;Wythecomb&quot;, the brother of Elizabeth Lucar, was forester &quot;temp.&quot; under Henry VI, between 1422 and 1461. William de Botreaux, 3rd Baron Botreaux was appointed in 1435 warden of the forests of Exmoor and Neroche for life by Richard Duke of York. The Botreaux family had long held the manor of Molland at the southern edge of Exmoor, but were probably resident mainly at North Cadbury in Somerset. On 10 May 1461 William Bourchier, 9th Baron FitzWarin, feudal baron of Bampton was appointed by King Edward IV as Master Forester of the Forests of Exmoor and Neroche for life. Sir John Poyntz of Iron Acton, Gloucestershire, was warden or chief forester of Exmoor in 1568 when he brought an action in the Court of Exchequer against Henry Rolle (of Heanton Satchville, Petrockstowe), the powerful lord of the manors of Exton, Hawkridge and Withypool.

In 1608 Sir Hugh Pollard was named as chief forester in a suit brought before the Court of Exchequer by his deputy William Pincombe. James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, was named as Keeper of Exmoor Forest in 1660 and 1661. James Boevey was a forester in the 17th century. Sir Richard Acland (or possibly Sir Thomas Dyke Acland) was the last forester up to 1818. One of the roles of the Warden was Master of Staghounds and this role continued to be exercised by the Master of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds, a position extant today. By 1820 the royal forest had been divided up. A quarter of the forest, , was sold to John Knight (1765–1850) in 1818. This section comprises the present Exmoor Parish, whose parish church is situated in Simonsbath.

==Wool trade==
The parish of Exmoor Forest was part of the Hundred of Williton and Freemanners. During the Middle Ages, sheep farming for the wool trade came to dominate the economy. The wool was spun into thread on isolated farms and collected by merchants to be woven, fulled, dyed and finished in thriving towns such as Dunster. The land started to be enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed, leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields. During the 16th and 17th centuries the commons were overstocked with agisted livestock, from farmers outside the immediate area who were charged for the privilege. This led to disputes about the number of animals allowed and the enclosure of land. In the mid-17th century James Boevey was the warden. The house that he built at Simonsbath was the only one in the forest for 150 years. When the royal forest was sold off in 1818, John Knight bought the Simonsbath House and the accompanying farm for £50,000. He set about converting the royal forest into agricultural land. He and his family also built most of the large farms in the central section of the moor as well as of metalled access roads to Simonsbath and a wall around his estate, much of which still survives.

In the mid-19th century a mine was developed alongside the River Barle. The mine was originally called Wheal Maria, then changed to Wheal Eliza. It was a copper mine from 1845 to 1854 and then an iron mine until 1857, although the first mining activity on the site may be from 1552. At Simonsbath, a restored Victorian water-powered sawmill, which was damaged in the floods of 1992, has now been purchased by the National Park and returned to working order; it is now used to make the footpath signs, gates, stiles and bridges for various sites in the park.

==Ecology==

In addition to the Exmoor Coastal Heaths Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), two other areas are specifically designated. North Exmoor covers and includes the Dunkery Beacon and the Holnicote and Horner Water Nature Conservation Review sites, and the Chains Geological Conservation Review site. The Chains site is nationally important for its south-western lowland heath communities and for transitions from Ancient woodland through upland heath to blanket mire. The site is also of importance for its breeding bird communities, its large population of the nationally rare heath fritillary (&quot;Mellicta athalia&quot;), an exceptional woodland lichen flora and its palynological interest of deep peat on the Chains.

The South Exmoor SSSI is smaller, covering and including the River Barle and its tributaries with submerged plants such as alternate water-milfoil (&quot;Myriophyllum alterniflorum&quot;). There are small areas of semi-natural woodland within the site, including some which are ancient. The most abundant tree species is sessile oak (&quot;Quercus petraea&quot;), the shrub layer is very sparse and the ground flora includes bracken, bilberry and a variety of mosses. The heaths have strong breeding populations of birds, including whinchat (&quot;Saxicola rubetra&quot;) and European stonechat (&quot;Saxicola rubicola&quot;). Wheatear (&quot;Oenanthe oenanthe&quot;) are common near stone boundary walls and other stony places. Grasshopper warbler (&quot;Locustella naevia&quot;) breed in scrub and tall heath. Trees on the moorland edges provide nesting sites for Lesser redpoll (&quot;Acanthis cabaret&quot;), common buzzard (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;) and raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;).

===Flora===
Uncultivated heath and moorland cover about a quarter of Exmoor landscape. Some moors are covered by a variety of grasses and sedges, while others are dominated by heather. There are also cultivated areas including the Brendon Hills, which lie in the east of the National Park. There are also of Forestry Commission woodland, comprising a mixture of broad-leaved (oak, ash and hazel) and conifer trees. Horner Woodlands and Tarr Steps woodlands are prime examples. The country&#x27;s highest beech tree, above sea level, is at Birch Cleave at Simonsbath but beech in hedgebanks grow up to . At least two species of whitebeam: &quot;Sorbus subcuneata&quot; and Sorbus &#x27;Taxon D&#x27; are unique to Exmoor. These woodlands are home to lichens, mosses and ferns. Exmoor is the only national location for the lichens &quot;Biatoridium delitescens&quot;, &quot;Rinodina fimbriata&quot; and &quot;Rinodina flavosoralifera&quot;, the latter having been found only on one individual tree.

In 2024, plans were unveiled to plant approximately 38,000 trees near the sea on Exmoor as part of a larger initiative led by the National Trust to plant over 100,000 trees in northern Devon, aimed at supporting Celtic rainforests. Among the species earmarked for planting is the nearly extinct Devon whitebeam, a tree found only in England&#x27;s West Country and in Ireland. It can reproduce without fertilization and once had its edible fruit sold as &quot;sorb apples&quot; in Devon markets.

===Fauna===

Sheep have grazed on the moors for more than 3,000 years, shaping much of the Exmoor landscape by feeding on moorland grasses and heather. Traditional breeds include Exmoor Horn, Cheviot and Whiteface Dartmoor and Greyface Dartmoor sheep. North Devon cattle are also farmed in the area. Exmoor ponies can be seen roaming freely on the moors. They are a landrace rather than a breed of pony, and may be the closest breed to wild horses remaining in Europe; they are also one of the oldest breeds of pony in the world. The ponies are rounded up once a year to be marked and checked over. In 1818 Sir Thomas Acland, the last warden of Exmoor, took thirty ponies and established the Acland Herd, now known as the Anchor Herd, whose direct descendants still roam the moor. In the Second World War the moor became a training ground, and the breed was nearly killed off, with only 50 ponies surviving the war. The ponies are classified as endangered by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, with only 390 breeding females left in the UK. In 2006 a Rural Enterprise Grant, administered locally by the South West Rural Development Service, was obtained to create a new Exmoor Pony Centre at Ashwick, at a disused farm with of land with a further of moorland.

Red deer have a stronghold on the moor and can be seen on quiet hillsides in remote areas, particularly in the early morning. The Emperor of Exmoor, a red stag (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;), was Britain&#x27;s largest known wild land animal, until it was killed in October 2010. The moorland habitat is also home to hundreds of species of birds and insects. Birds seen on the moor include merlin, peregrine falcon, Eurasian curlew, European stonechat, dipper, Dartford warbler and ring ouzel. Black grouse and red grouse are now extinct on Exmoor, probably as a result of a reduction in habitat management, and for the former species, an increase in visitor pressure.

===Beast===
The Beast of Exmoor is a cryptozoological cat (see phantom cat) that is reported to roam Exmoor. There have been numerous reports of eyewitness sightings. The BBC calls it &quot;the famous-yet-elusive beast of Exmoor&quot;. Sightings were first reported in the 1970s although it became notorious in 1983, when a South Molton farmer claimed to have lost over 100 sheep in the space of three months, all of them apparently killed by violent throat injuries. In response to these reports Royal Marine Commandos were deployed from bases in the West Country to watch for the mythical beast from covert observation points. After 6 months no sightings had been made by the Royal Marines and the deployments were ended. Descriptions of its colouration range from black to tan or dark grey. It is possibly a cougar or black leopard which was released after a law was passed in 1976 making it illegal for them to be kept in captivity outside zoos. In 2006, the British Big Cats Society reported that a skull found by a Devon farmer was that of a puma; however, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states, &quot;Based on the evidence, Defra does not believe that there are big cats living in the wild in England.&quot;

==Government and politics==

The National Park, 71% of which is in Somerset and 29% in Devon, has a resident population of 10,600. It was designated a National Park in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. About three quarters of the park is privately owned, made up of numerous private estates. The largest landowners are the National Trust, which owns over 10% of the land, and the National Park Authority, which owns about 7%. Other areas are owned by the Forestry Commission, Crown Estate and Water Companies. The largest private landowner is the &quot;Badgworthy Land Company&quot;, which represents hunting interests.

From 1954 on, local government was the responsibility of the district and county councils, which remain responsible for the social and economic well-being of the local community. Since 1997 the Exmoor National Park Authority, which is known as a &#x27;single purpose&#x27; authority, has taken over some functions to meet its aims to &quot;conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks&quot; and &quot;promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the parks by the public&quot;, including responsibility for the conservation of the historic environment.

The Park Authority receives 80% of its funding as a direct grant from the government. The Park Authority Committee consists of members from parish and county councils, and six appointed by the Secretary of State. The work is carried out by 80 staff including rangers, volunteers and a team of estate workers who carry out a wide range of tasks including maintaining the many miles of rights of way, hedge laying, fencing, swaling, walling, invasive weed control and habitat management on National Park Authority land. There are ongoing debates between the authority and farmers over the biological monitoring of SSSIs, showing the need for a controlled regime of grazing and burning; farmers claim that these regimes are not practical or effective in the long term.

The National Park Authority operates CareMoor for Exmoor as an opportunity for those that appreciate the area to give back, with donations supporting conservation and access projects.

==Sport and recreation==
Sightseeing, walking, cycling and mountain biking taking in Exmoor&#x27;s dramatic heritage coastline and moorland countryside scenery are the main attractions.
The South West Coast Path starts at Minehead and follows all along the Exmoor coast before continuing to Poole.

The Coleridge Way is an footpath which follows the walks taken by poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge to Lynmouth, starting from Coleridge Cottage at Nether Stowey in the Quantocks where he once lived.
The Two Moors Way runs from Ivybridge in South Devon to Lynmouth on the coast of North Devon, crossing parts of both Dartmoor and Exmoor. Both of these walks intersect with the South West Coast Path, Britain&#x27;s longest National Trail.
Other Exmoor walking trails include the Tarka Trail, Samaritans Way South West, Macmillan Way West, Exe Valley Way and Celtic Way Exmoor Option.

In addition to long distant walks the Exmoor National Park Authority promote a series &#x27;top walks&#x27; in 3 collections of Exmoor Strolls (step and stile free routes more accessible routes), Exmoor Explorers (shorter walks to discover the best of Exmoor) and Exmoor Classics (longer walks to discover more of Exmoor).

For others, although the hunting of animal with hounds was made illegal by the Hunting Act 2004, the Exmoor hunts still meet in full regalia and there is a campaign to resurrect this rural sport. Nine hunts cover the area—the Devon and Somerset Staghounds and the Quantock Staghounds, the Exmoor, Dulverton West, Dulverton Farmers and West Somerset Foxhounds, the Minehead Harriers, the West Somerset Beagles and the North Devon Beagles. During the spring, amateur steeplechase meetings (point-to-points) are run by hunts at temporary courses such as Bratton Down and Holnicote. These, along with thoroughbred racing and pony racing, are an opportunity for farmers, hunt staff and the public to witness a day of traditional country entertainment.

==Places of interest==

The attractions of Exmoor include 208 Scheduled monuments, 16 conservation areas, and other open access land as designated by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Exmoor receives approximately 1.4 million visitor days per year which include single day visits and those for longer periods.

The Exmoor National Park Authority operates three Exmoor National Park Centres in Dulverton, Dunster and Lynmouth to provide information and inspiration for users of the National Park.

Attractions on the coast include the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway, which connects Lynton to neighbouring picturesque Lynmouth at the confluence of the East Lyn and West Lyn rivers, nearby Valley of Rocks and Watersmeet.

Woody Bay, a few miles west of Lynton, is home to the Lynton &amp; Barnstaple Railway, a narrow-gauge railway which once connected the twin towns of Lynton and Lynmouth to Barnstaple, about 31 km (just over 19 miles) away.

Further along the coast, Porlock is a quiet coastal town with an adjacent salt marsh nature reserve and a harbour at nearby Porlock Weir. Watchet is a historic harbour town with a marina and is home to a carnival, which is held annually in July.

Inland, many of the attractions are small towns and villages or linked to the river valleys, such as the ancient clapper bridge at Tarr Steps and the Snowdrop Valley near Wheddon Cross, which is carpeted in snowdrops in February and, later, displays bluebells. Withypool is also in the Barle Valley, the Two Moors Way passes through the village. As well as Dunster Castle, Dunster&#x27;s other attractions include a priory, dovecote, yarn market, inn, packhorse bridge, mill and a stop on the West Somerset Railway. Exford lies on the River Exe.

Exmoor has been the setting for several novels including the 19th-century &quot;Lorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor&quot; by R. D. Blackmore, and Margaret Drabble&#x27;s 1998 novel &quot;The Witch of Exmoor&quot;. The park was featured on the television programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; twice, as one of the wonders of the West Country.

Wheal Eliza Mine on the River Barle near Simonsbath was an unsuccessful copper and iron mine.

Near Wheddon Cross is Snowdrop Valley, which becomes filled with thousands of little white flowers called snowdrops during early spring. Within the valley is a sawmill, formerly powered by the River Avill, which runs through the valley.

From 1998 to 2001, he was a producer and anchor for Fox Sports Net and a host for Fox Sports&#x27; coverage of Major League Baseball.

From March 2003 to January 2011, Olbermann hosted the weeknight political commentary program &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; on MSNBC. He received attention for his pointed criticism of American conservative and right-wing politicians and public figures. Although he has frequently been described as a &quot;liberal&quot;, he has often rejected being labelled politically, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m not a liberal. I&#x27;m an American.&quot;

From 2011 to March 30, 2012, Olbermann was the chief news officer of the Current TV network and the host of a Current TV program also called &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;. From July 2013 until July 2015 he hosted a late-afternoon show on ESPN2 and TSN2 called &quot;Olbermann&quot;, as well as TBS&#x27;s Major League Baseball postseason coverage. From September 2016 until November 2017, he hosted a web series for &quot;GQ&quot;, titled &quot;The Closer with Keith Olbermann&quot;, covering the 2016 U.S. presidential election, later renamed &quot;The Resistance with Keith Olbermann&quot; after the victory of Donald Trump.

In January 2018, Olbermann returned to ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; program, expanding in May to some baseball play-by-play work. On October 6, 2020, he again resigned from ESPN to start a political commentary program on his YouTube channel. On August 1, 2022, Olbermann relaunched &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; as a daily podcast with iHeartRadio. It is described as a news-driven show featuring his trademark &quot;Special Comment&quot; political analysis, &quot;The Worst Persons in the World&quot; segment, and readings from the works of humorist James Thurber.

== Early life ==
Olbermann was born January 27, 1959, in New York City, the son of Marie Katherine (née Charbonier), a preschool teacher, and Theodore Olbermann, a commercial architect. He is of German ancestry. Olbermann and his younger sister Jenna (b. 1968), were raised in a Unitarian household in the town of Hastings-on-Hudson in Westchester, New York. He attended the Hackley School, a private Ivy League Preparatory school in nearby Tarrytown.

Olbermann became a devoted fan of baseball at a young age, a love he inherited from his mother, who was a lifelong New York Yankees fan. As a teenager he often wrote about baseball card-collecting and appeared in many sports card-collecting periodicals of the mid-1970s. He is also referenced in &quot;Sports Collectors Bible&quot;, a 1979 book by Bert Sugar, which is considered one of the important early books for trading card collectors.

While at Hackley, Olbermann began his broadcasting career as a play-by-play announcer for WHTR. After graduating from Hackley in 1975, he enrolled at Cornell University at the age of 16. At college Olbermann served as sports director for WVBR, a student-run commercial radio station in Ithaca. Olbermann graduated from Cornell University&#x27;s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in 1979 with a BS in communication.

== Sports broadcasting ==
Olbermann began his professional career at UPI and the RKO Radio Network before joining then-nascent CNN in 1981. Among the early stories he covered was the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, including the &quot;Miracle on Ice.&quot; In the early-to-mid 1980s he was a sportscaster on the old WNEW 1130-AM radio station in New York City. In 1984, he briefly worked as a sports anchor at WCVB-TV in Boston before heading to Los Angeles to work at KTLA and KCBS. His work there earned him 11 Golden Mike Awards, and he was named best sportscaster by the California Associated Press three times.

=== ESPN ===
In 1992 Olbermann joined ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, a position he held until 1997 with the exception of a period from 1993 to 1994 when he was at ESPN2. He joined ESPN2 as its &quot;marquee&quot; personality to help launch the network. He often co-hosted &quot;SportsCenter&quot;″s 11:00 p.m. show with Dan Patrick, the two becoming a popular anchor team. In 1995 Olbermann won a Cable ACE award for Best Sportscaster. he later co-authored a book with Patrick called &quot;The Big Show&quot; about their experiences working at &quot;SportsCenter&quot;; he also said that the short-lived ABC dramedy &quot;Sports Night&quot; was based on his time on &quot;SportsCenter&quot; with Patrick, ABC having been co-owned with ESPN since 1985 (ESPN now produces all sports coverage on ABC, which is branded &quot;ESPN on ABC&quot;). In his last year with KCBS before moving east to work for ESPN, Olbermann&#x27;s salary was $475,000 but started at &quot;just over $150,000&quot; with ESPN. He made $350,000 at the end of his tenure at ESPN.

Early in 1997 Olbermann was suspended for two weeks after he made an unauthorized appearance on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; on Comedy Central with then-host and former ESPN colleague Craig Kilborn. At one point in the show he referred to Bristol, Connecticut (ESPN&#x27;s headquarters), as a &quot;Godforsaken place&quot;. Later that year he abruptly left ESPN under a cloud of controversy, apparently burning his bridges with the network&#x27;s management; this began a long and drawn-out feud between Olbermann and ESPN. Between 1997 and 2007 incidents between the two sides included Olbermann&#x27;s publishing an essay on &quot;Salon&quot; in November 2002 titled &quot;Mea Culpa&quot;, in which he stated, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t handle the pressure of working in daily long-form television, and what was worse, I didn&#x27;t know I couldn&#x27;t handle it.&quot; The essay told of an instance when his former bosses remarked he had &quot;too much backbone&quot;, a claim that is literally true, as Olbermann has six lumbar vertebrae instead of the normal five.

In 2004, Olbermann was not included in ESPN&#x27;s guest lineup for its 25th anniversary &quot;SportsCenter&quot; &quot;Reunion Week&quot;, which saw Craig Kilborn and Charley Steiner return to the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; set. In 2007, ten years after Olbermann&#x27;s departure, in an appearance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, he said, &quot;If you burn a bridge, you can possibly build a new bridge, but if there&#x27;s no river any more, that&#x27;s a lot of trouble.&quot; During the same interview Olbermann stated that he had recently learned that as a result of ESPN&#x27;s agreeing to let him return to the airwaves on ESPN Radio, he was banned from ESPN&#x27;s main (Bristol, Connecticut) campus.

=== Post-&quot;SportsCenter&quot; ===
In 1999, Olbermann joined Fox Sports Net to be the star anchor for their sports news show &quot;Fox Sports News Primetime&quot;, which was an ill-fated competitor to &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. Olbermann later left that show to be an anchor and executive producer for &quot;The Keith Olbermann Evening News&quot;, a sportscast similar to &quot;SportsCenter&quot; that aired weekly on Sunday evenings. While at Fox he hosted the 2000 World Series as well as Fox Broadcasting&#x27;s baseball &quot;Game of the Week&quot;. In May and July 1999, Olbermann also guest-starred ten times on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;.

According to Olbermann, he was demoted by Fox when he asked for a slight reduction in duties for health reasons, and then was fired from Fox in 2001 after reporting on rumors that Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns Fox, was planning on selling the Los Angeles Dodgers. Olbermann characterized the demotion as &quot;blackmail.&quot; When asked about Olbermann, Murdoch said, &quot;I fired him ... He&#x27;s crazy.&quot; In 2004 Olbermann remarked, &quot;Fox Sports was an infant trying to stand [in comparison to ESPN], but on the broadcast side there was no comparison—ESPN was the bush leagues.&quot;

After Olbermann left Fox Sports in 2001, he provided twice-daily sports commentary on the ABC Radio Network, reviving the &quot;Speaking of Sports&quot; and &quot;Speaking of Everything&quot; segments begun by Howard Cosell. In 2005, Olbermann made a return to ESPN Radio when he began co-hosting an hour of the syndicated &quot;Dan Patrick Show&quot; on ESPN Radio, a tenure that lasted until Patrick left ESPN on August 17, 2007. Olbermann and Patrick referred to this segment as &quot;The Big Show&quot;, just as their book was known. Patrick often introduced Olbermann with the tagline &quot;saving the democracy&quot;, a nod to his work on &quot;Countdown&quot;. On April 16, 2007, Olbermann was named co-host of &quot;Football Night in America&quot;, NBC&#x27;s NFL pre-game show that precedes their Sunday Night NFL game, a position which reunited him in 2008 with his former &quot;SportsCenter&quot; co-anchor Dan Patrick. Olbermann left the show prior to the start of the 2010 season.

Shortly before rejoining ESPN, Olbermann signed a contract with TBS to host the studio show portions of its coverage of the Division Series and National League Championship Series. He replaced Matt Winer, who had been in this role since his departure from ESPN to join the Turner Sports family, and was originally supposed to host the show with TBS&#x27; Dennis Eckersley. Instead, Eckersley was sent to join Don Orsillo and Buck Martinez to call the Detroit-Oakland series. TBS later hired Dirk Hayhurst, Pedro Martínez, and Mark DeRosa to provide analysis. Tom Verducci also joined the studio crew, as he was replaced by Rachel Nichols as a field reporter.

=== Return to and departure from ESPN ===

It was announced on July 17, 2013, that Olbermann would host his own one-hour nightly show on ESPN2. The two-year contract would allow him to deviate from the topic of sports into realms such as &quot;pop culture and current events&quot;, as well as politics, which was a right Olbermann claimed he did not intend to exercise.

Olbermann was suspended by ESPN in 2015 for the week following Penn State University&#x27;s annual philanthropy THON due to a Twitter exchange he had with Penn State supporters. THON is the world&#x27;s largest student-run philanthropy, raising over $160 million for pediatric cancer research since 1977. In the Twitter exchange, Olbermann stated, &quot;PSU students are pitiful.&quot; Later, prior to apologizing, Olbermann stated, &quot;I&#x27;d like to thank the students and alums of Penn State for proving my point about the mediocrity of their education and ethics.&quot; Olbermann apologized on his program upon his return March 2, but noted, &quot;I&#x27;m much more sorry about batting practice [i.e. trolling or cyber bullying]. So for me, batting practice ends.&quot;

In July 2015 ESPN announced that it would be Olbermann&#x27;s last month with the network. ESPN said that it was a &quot;business decision to move in another direction&quot;.

=== The Ringer ===
In 2016, Olbermann wrote an article for Bill Simmons&#x27; company &quot;The Ringer&quot; after Muhammad Ali&#x27;s death.

===Third tenure with ESPN===

In January 2018, Olbermann returned to ESPN once again, presenting occasional commentaries on &quot;SportsCenter&quot; throughout the first half of 2018. In May 2018, Olbermann&#x27;s role at ESPN expanded to include a return to the role of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; host and the addition of occasional ESPN Major League Baseball play-by-play.

== News journalism ==
In 1997, Olbermann left ESPN to host a prime-time show on MSNBC, &quot;The Big Show with Keith Olbermann&quot; (ESPN objected to the use of the title). The news-driven program, with substantial discussion, relied on Olbermann to carry the 8:00–9:00 pm hour. The show typically covered three or four topics in a one-hour broadcast. Olbermann also hosted two Sunday editions of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and once co-anchored a Saturday edition of the &quot;Today&quot; show. During that period Olbermann, along with Hannah Storm, also co-hosted NBC Sports&#x27; pre-game coverage of the MLB 1997 World Series. Olbermann became frustrated as his show was consumed by the Monica Lewinsky scandal. In 1998, he stated that his work at MSNBC would &quot;make me ashamed, make me depressed, make me cry.&quot;

Olbermann left MSNBC for Fox Sports Net shortly thereafter. After leaving Fox Sports in 2001, Olbermann returned once more to news journalism. In 2003, his network won an Edward R. Murrow Award for writing on the &quot;Keith Olbermann Speaking of Everything&quot; show. In addition, Olbermann wrote a weekly column for Salon.com from July 2002 until early 2003, worked for CNN as a freelance reporter, and was a fill-in for newscaster Paul Harvey. Olbermann revived his association with MSNBC in 2003 briefly as a substitute host on &quot;Nachman&quot; and as an anchor for the network&#x27;s coverage of the war in Iraq.

=== &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; ===

Olbermann&#x27;s own show, &quot;Countdown&quot;, debuted on MSNBC on March 31, 2003, in the 8 p.m. ET time slot previously held by programs hosted by Phil Donahue and, briefly, Lester Holt. &quot;Countdown&#x27;s&quot; format, per its name, involved Olbermann ranking the five biggest news stories of the day or sometimes &quot;stories my producers force me to cover&quot;, as Olbermann put it. This was done in numerically reverse order, counting down with the first story shown being ranked fifth but apparently the most important.

The first few stories shown were typically oriented toward government, politics, and world events; the segments ranked numbers two and one were typically of a lighter fare than the preceding segments. These lighter stories sometimes involved celebrities, sports, and, regularly and somewhere in the middle, the bizarre, in a segment he called &quot;Oddball.&quot; Opinions on each were offered by Olbermann and guests interviewed during the segment. Olbermann had been criticized for only having guests that agree with his perspective. Former &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; television critic Howard Rosenberg stated that &quot;&quot;Countdown&quot; is more or less an echo chamber in which Olbermann and like-minded bobbleheads nod at each other.&quot;

On October 13, 2004, Olbermann launched &quot;Bloggermann&quot;, his &quot;Countdown&quot; blog, hosted on MSNBC&#x27;s website. Olbermann used the open format of the blog to expand on facts or ideas alluded to in the broadcast, to offer personal musings and reactions. However, in February 2007, Olbermann launched a new blog, &quot;The News Hole&quot;.

In a technique similar to that of former CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite in connection to the Iran Hostage Crisis, for the last six years of the program, Olbermann closed every show by announcing the number of days passed since President George W. Bush had declared the end of &quot;major combat operations&quot; in Iraq under a banner that read &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; (May 1, 2003). Olbermann would then crumple up his notes, throwing them at the camera and saying &quot;Good night and good luck&quot;, echoing another former CBS newsman, Edward R. Murrow. (Yet Olbermann himself discounted this gesture to his hero as &quot;presumptuous&quot; and a &quot;feeble tribute.&quot;)

On February 16, 2007, MSNBC reported that Olbermann had signed a four-year extension on his contract with MSNBC for &quot;Countdown&quot; which also provided for his hosting of two &quot;Countdown&quot; specials a year to be aired on NBC as well as for his occasional contribution of essays on &quot;NBC&#x27;s Nightly News with Brian Williams&quot;.

Olbermann co-anchored, with Chris Matthews, MSNBC&#x27;s coverage of the death of fellow NBC News employee Tim Russert on June 13, 2008. He presented a tribute, along with several fellow journalists, in honor of Russert.

During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Olbermann co-anchored MSNBC&#x27;s coverage with Chris Matthews until September 7, 2008, when they were replaced by David Gregory after complaints from both outside and inside of NBC that they were making partisan statements. This apparent conflict of interest had been an issue as early as May 2007, when Giuliani campaign officials complained about his serving in dual roles, as both a host and a commentator. Despite this, &quot;Countdown&quot; was broadcast both before and after each of the presidential and vice-presidential debates, and Olbermann and Matthews joined Gregory on MSNBC&#x27;s Election Day coverage. Olbermann and Matthews also led MSNBC&#x27;s coverage of the inauguration of President Barack Obama.

In November 2008, it was announced that Olbermann had signed a four-year contract extension worth an estimated $30 million.

==== Feud with Bill O&#x27;Reilly ====
After beginning &quot;Countdown&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Worst Person in the World&quot; segment in July 2005, Olbermann repeatedly awarded Bill O&#x27;Reilly, host of &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; on Fox News Channel, the dubious honor. The feud between the anchors originated with Olbermann&#x27;s extensive coverage of a 2004 sexual harassment suit brought against O&#x27;Reilly by former Fox News Channel producer Andrea Mackris during which Olbermann asked &quot;Countdown&quot; viewers to fund the purchase of lurid audio tapes allegedly held by Mackris. In 2008 O&#x27;Reilly decided to avoid mentioning Olbermann&#x27;s name on the air, and once cut off a caller who mentioned Olbermann. O&#x27;Reilly has also criticized MSNBC&#x27;s news commentary and political coverage without ever specifically mentioning Olbermann. The rivalry continued when in 2006 at Television Critics&#x27; Association in California, Olbermann donned a mask of O&#x27;Reilly and made a Nazi salute, leading to a letter of protest from the Anti-Defamation League.

In an article on &quot;perhaps the fiercest media feud of the decade&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Brian Stelter noted that in early June 2009 the &quot;combat&quot; between the two hosts seemed to have abruptly ended as a result of instructions filtered down to Olbermann and O&#x27;Reilly from the chief executives of their respective networks. On the August 3, 2009, edition of &quot;Countdown&quot;, Olbermann asserted that he had made statements to Stelter before the article was published denying that he was a party to such a deal, or that there was such a deal between NBC and Fox News, or that any NBC executive had asked him to change &quot;Countdown&quot;&#x27;s content. Olbermann maintained that he had stopped joking about O&#x27;Reilly because of O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s attacks of George Tiller, and soon resumed his criticism of O&#x27;Reilly.

==== Suspension ====
On October 28, 2010, days before the 2010 U.S. elections, Olbermann donated $2,400 each to three Democratic candidates for Congress: Kentucky Senate candidate Jack Conway, and Arizona Democratic Representatives Raul Grijalva and Gabby Giffords. Grijalva had appeared on Olbermann&#x27;s show immediately before Olbermann mailed the donations. In response, on November 5, MSNBC President Phil Griffin suspended him indefinitely without pay for violating a network policy which required employees to obtain approval from management before making political contributions. An online petition calling for his reinstatement received over 250,000 signatures; two days after the suspension began, Griffin announced that Olbermann would return to the air on November 9.

==== Departure ====
On January 21, 2011, Olbermann announced his departure from MSNBC and that the episode would be the final episode of &quot;Countdown&quot;. MSNBC issued a statement that it had ended its contract with Olbermann, with no further explanation. Additional reporting in the days immediately following suggested that the negotiations for the end of Olbermann&#x27;s tenure at MSNBC had begun soon after the end of his suspension.

=== Current TV and FOKNewsChannel.com ===
On February 8, 2011, it was announced that Olbermann had become the chief news officer for the public affairs channel Current TV and would begin hosting a one-hour prime time program on the network at 8 pm Eastern – the same time slot that &quot;Countdown&quot; had been on MSNBC. On April 26, 2011, it was announced that Olbermann&#x27;s new show would debut on June 20 and would be named &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;. Olbermann was also heavily involved in the development of the rest of the network&#x27;s news programming. The deal also included an equity stake in Current TV.

During the interim between shows, Olbermann launched an &quot;official not-for-profit&quot; blog called FOKNewsChannel.com, &quot;FOK&quot; being an abbreviation for &quot;Friends of Keith&quot;. The blog featured political commentaries by Olbermann—including viral video versions of &quot;Countdown&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Special Comment&quot; and &quot;Worst Person&quot; segments, as well as photographs of his outings at professional baseball games. On May 29, 2011, the FOKNewsChannel.com domain redirected to the Current website promoting the June 20 launch.

Olbermann was fired from Current TV on March 30, 2012. In a statement from Current TV, they stated that &quot;Current was [...] founded on the values of respect, openness, collegiality, and loyalty to our viewers. Unfortunately these values are no longer reflected in our relationship with Keith Olbermann and we have ended it.&quot; Olbermann released his own statement, apologizing for &quot;the failure of Current TV&quot; and &quot;that the claims against me implied in Current&#x27;s statement are untrue and will be proved so in the legal actions I will be filing against them presently.&quot;
The two parties sued each other over Olbermann&#x27;s firing. On March 12, 2013, it was announced that Olbermann settled his $50 million legal claim. In a joint statement, Olbermann and Current TV said: &quot;The parties are pleased to announce that a settlement has occurred, and that the terms are confidential. Nothing more will be disclosed regarding the settlement.&quot;
According to &quot;Politico&quot;, Olbermann&#x27;s professional reputation suffered greatly as a result of his dispute with Current, which accused Olbermann of making &quot;material breaches of his contract, including the failure to show up at work, sabotaging the network and attacking Current and its executives.&quot; Purportedly, despite actively shopping other networks for offers, Olbermann was unable to find an outlet interested in hiring him. According to &quot;Politico&quot;, the fact Olbermann had been rendered unemployable as a result of the dispute, factored heavily during settlement negotiations between his attorneys and representatives from CurrentTV.

=== GQ ===
On September 12, 2016, &quot;GQ&quot; magazine announced that Olbermann would, as a special correspondent, host a web series covering the 2016 US presidential election. The series, titled &quot;The Closer with Keith Olbermann&quot;, aired twice weekly on GQ.com. It was retitled &quot;The Resistance&quot; after Donald Trump&#x27;s victory. , it had nearly 170 million views on &quot;GQ&quot;″s YouTube and Facebook. In mid-October 2017, Penguin Random House issued a hardcover book by Olbermann, &quot;Trump Is F*cking Crazy (This Is Not a Joke)&quot;, consisting of 50 essays based on &quot;The Resistance&quot; commentaries. On November 27, 2017, in episode 147 of &quot;The Resistance&quot;, Olbermann announced his retirement from political commentary, citing his belief that &quot;this ... presidency of Donald John Trump will end prematurely and end soon, and I am thus also confident that this is the correct moment to end this series of commentaries&quot;.

=== &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; Podcast ===
On August 1, 2022, Olbermann began producing and hosting a weekday podcast titled &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;, for iHeart Media. It usually consists of a similar five block show from the TV days with three blocks changed out. The main, a dog in need, a headlines section, worst person, a sports rundown and the number one story either being a story of Olbermann&#x27;s (usually his experience in the news media) or a short story from James Thurber on Fridays.

== Acting ==
Olbermann has made several acting appearances either as himself or simply as a sports/newscaster, most notably as Tom Jumbo-Grumbo (a blue whale newscaster on the MSNBSea network) in several episodes of &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;.

== Political positions ==

=== Viewpoints ===
Although it began as a traditional newscast, &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; eventually adopted an opinion-oriented format. In a &quot;Countdown&quot; interview with Al Franken on October 25, 2005, Olbermann noted that in 2003, after having Janeane Garofalo and Franken on his show, a vice president of MSNBC had questioned him on inviting &quot;liberals&quot; on consecutive nights, contrasting that occurrence to the apparent ideological latitude he enjoyed at the time of the second Franken interview.

In January 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s Howard Kurtz wrote that Olbermann was &quot;position[ing] his program as an increasingly liberal alternative to &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;.&quot; Much of the program featured harsh criticism of prominent Republicans and right-leaning figures, including those who worked for or supported the George W. Bush administration, 2008 Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain and running mate Governor Sarah Palin, and rival news commentator Bill O&#x27;Reilly, whom Olbermann has routinely dubbed the &quot;Worst Person in the World&quot;.

The October 2007 edition of &quot;Playboy&quot; carried an Olbermann interview in which he stated, &quot;Al Qaeda really hurt us, but not as much as Rupert Murdoch has hurt us, particularly in the case of Fox News. Fox News is worse than Al Qaeda — worse for our society. It&#x27;s as dangerous as the Ku Klux Klan ever was.&quot;

In November 2007, British newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; placed Olbermann at No. 67 on their Top 100 list of most influential US liberals. It said that he used his MSNBC show to promote &quot;an increasingly strident liberal agenda.&quot; It added that he would be &quot;a force on the Left for some time to come.&quot; Avoiding ideological self-labeling, Olbermann described his reporting in 2006 to Salon.com, &quot;I don&#x27;t think in these issues that I&#x27;m a liberal; I think that I&#x27;m an American. I think I&#x27;m acting almost as a historian on these particular things&quot;. During the 2008 Democratic Party primaries, Olbermann frequently chastised presidential aspirant Hillary Clinton for her campaign tactics against her principal opponent, Senator Barack Obama, and made her the subject of two of his &quot;special comments&quot;. Olbermann has also posted on the liberal blog Daily Kos.

Before the 2010 Massachusetts special election, Olbermann called Republican candidate Scott Brown &quot;an irresponsible, homophobic, racist, reactionary, ex-nude model, Tea Bagging supporter of violence against women, and against politicians with whom he disagrees&quot;. This was criticized by his colleague Joe Scarborough, who called the comments &quot;reckless&quot; and &quot;sad&quot;. Yael T. Abouhalkah of the &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; said that Olbermann &quot;crossed the line in a major way with his comments&quot;. The next night, Olbermann chose to &quot;double down&quot;, as &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;&#x27;s Danny Shea described it, on his criticism of Brown by adding the word &quot;sexist&quot; to his original description of the Republican candidate. Jon Stewart criticized Olbermann about this attack on his show, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, by noting that it was &quot;the harshest description of anyone I&#x27;ve ever heard uttered on MSNBC&quot;. Following Stewart&#x27;s critique, Olbermann apologized by noting, &quot;I have been a little over the top lately. Point taken. Sorry.&quot;

Olbermann accused the Tea Party movement of being racist due to what he views as a lack of racial diversity at the events, using photos that show overwhelmingly white crowds attending the rallies. In response, the Dallas Tea Party invited him to attend one of their events and also criticized his network for a lack of racial diversity, pointing out that an online banner of MSNBC personalities that appears on the website shows only white personalities. Olbermann declined the invitation, citing his father&#x27;s prolonged ill health and hospitalization and stated that the network has minority anchors, contributors and guests.

In October 2020, Olbermann called for supporters and what he described as &quot;enablers&quot; of Donald Trump, including United States Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett and conservative political commentator Sean Hannity, to be &quot;prosecuted&quot; and &quot;removed from our society&quot;. Additionally. Olbermann labeled Trump &quot;a terrorist&quot; and called his supporters &quot;a blight that will be with us for generations&quot;, further saying that Trump&#x27;s &quot;only barely-human delight comes from the morons in the crowd.&quot;

In March 2024, Olbermann called for the United States Supreme Court to be dissolved following the court&#x27;s unanimous decision in &quot;Trump v. Anderson&quot; to allow Trump to remain on the ballot in the 2024 election.

=== Criticism of the Bush administration ===
In Olbermann&#x27;s &quot;Special Comment&quot; segment on July 3, 2007, he called George W. Bush&#x27;s commutation of Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby&#x27;s prison sentence the &quot;last straw&quot; and called for the resignation of Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. On his February 14, 2008, &quot;Special Comments&quot; segment, Olbermann castigated Bush for threatening to veto an extension of the Protect America Act unless it provided full immunity from lawsuits to telecom companies. During the same commentary, Olbermann called Bush a fascist. In a special comment on May 14, 2008, Olbermann criticized Bush for announcing that he had stopped playing golf in honor of American soldiers who died in the Iraq War. He stated that Bush never should have started the war in the first place, and he accused Bush of dishonesty and war crimes.

== Personal life ==
Olbermann suffers from a mild case of celiac disease, as well as restless legs syndrome. In August 1980, he also suffered a head injury while leaping onto a New York City Subway train. This head injury permanently upset his equilibrium, resulting in his avoidance of driving. Along with Bob Costas, he supports the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation as an honorary board member.

Olbermann&#x27;s father, Theodore, died on March 13, 2010, of complications from colon surgery the previous September. His mother had died several months before. Olbermann had cited the need to spend time with his father for taking a leave of absence shortly before his father&#x27;s death, occasionally recording segments to air at the beginning of the shows which Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell guest hosted in his absence, giving his views on the state of the American health care system and updating viewers on his father&#x27;s condition. Olbermann has dated several women involved in politics and journalism, including Katy Tur, Laura Ingraham, Kyrsten Sinema and Olivia Nuzzi.

Olbermann is a dedicated baseball fan and historian of the sport, with membership in the Society for American Baseball Research. In 1973, when he was 14 years old, The Card Memorabilia Associates (TCMA) published his book &quot;The Major League Coaches: 1921–1973&quot;. The September issue of Beckett Sports Collectibles Vintage included a T206 card that depicted Olbermann in a 1905-era New York Giants uniform. He argues that New York Giants baseball player Fred Merkle has been unduly criticized for his infamous baserunning mistake. He contributed the foreword to &quot;More Than Merkle&quot;, a book requesting amnesty for &quot;Merkle&#x27;s Boner&quot;. Olbermann was also one of the founders of the first experts&#x27; fantasy baseball league, the &quot;USA Today Baseball Weekly&quot; League of Alternative Baseball Reality, and he gave the league its nickname &quot;LABR&quot;. Olbermann wrote the foreword to the 2009 Baseball Prospectus Annual. In March 2009, Olbermann began a baseball-related blog entitled Baseball Nerd. He has also written a series of articles on baseball cards for the &quot;Sports Collectors Digest&quot;.

<doc id="273439" wikidata="Q1169684" url="?curid=273439" title="Milton County, Georgia">
<text>Milton County was a county of the U.S. state of Georgia from to . It was created on December 18, 1857, from parts of northeastern Cobb, southeastern Cherokee, and southwestern Forsyth counties. The county was named for John Milton, Secretary of State of Georgia from 1777 to 1799. Alpharetta was the county seat until the end of 1931, when Milton was merged with Fulton County to save it from bankruptcy during the Great Depression. At that time, Campbell County, which had already gone bankrupt, was also ceded to Fulton, giving it its 70-mile (110 km) long irregular shape along the Chattahoochee River.

Following the 1932 merger, the Cobb County town of Roswell was also ceded to Fulton four months later on May 9, 1932. The cession of Roswell (including everything east of Willeo Creek) made the new county more contiguous, though a very narrow strip (what is now the Dunwoody Panhandle of Sandy Springs, ceded to Milton from DeKalb) actually already connected the two sections.

In 1900, there were several other post offices besides Alpharetta: Arnold, Coker, Dinsmore, Field&#x27;s Cross Roads, Freemansville, McClure, Mazeppa, Ocee, Skelton, Stono, and Warsaw. Milton totaled or 94,080 acres. There was a population of 6,763, which was 555 more than at the previous (1890) census. Alpharetta had 310 residents; 1,529 lived in and around it. Methodists and Baptists were the dominant religious denominations.

==Re-creation proposals==

:&quot;See Secession section of Fulton County, Georgia for more in depth information&quot;

Fulton County has 10 percent of the state&#x27;s population, being larger than eight U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The Fulton County school district is the only non-contiguous school district in the state, having a 17-mile (27 km) separation (Atlanta Public Schools) between the north and south.

In recent years, some residents of north Fulton County have sought to re-create Milton County. The proposed plan would include some of Georgia&#x27;s largest cities in a new Milton County, such as Roswell (7th), Sandy Springs (8th), Johns Creek (12th), Alpharetta (13th), Milton (54th), as well as Mountain Park.

A February 2009 study completed in collaboration between the University of Georgia&#x27;s Carl Vinson Institute of Government and Georgia State University&#x27;s Andrew Young School of Policy Studies gave a positive analysis of the financial viability of the proposed Milton County.

A bill before the Georgia General Assembly in 2005 that proposed the inclusion of Sandy Springs would rename the remainder of Fulton County as &quot;Atlanta County&quot;. The state&#x27;s constitution, however, now prohibits any more than 159 counties, the number it has had since the merger in 1932. Any change would require a constitutional amendment, supported by two-thirds of each house in the General Assembly and by over half of all voters statewide in a referendum.

On January 9, 2007, state Representative Jan Jones, who represents the house district that includes Roswell, and representatives of adjacent districts introduced HR 12. Without mentioning Milton County by name, HR 12 proposed to amend the state constitution to allow the legislature to re-create previous counties regardless of the 159-county limit, if such an action is ratified by voters in the areas of the proposed re-created county. The amendment would disallow voters in the remaining parts of Fulton County from voting on the issue. Jones stated in November 2008 that she would reintroduce the bill in 2009, after the University of Georgia&#x27;s study of the issue was completed.

A resolution to amend the Georgia Constitution to ease the political path for resurrection of the county was reintroduced by the area&#x27;s legislators in the 2009 session as HR 21 and SR 392. As of 2009 February 18, HR 21 was reported favorably out of committee in a 7–1 vote. Reps. Jan Jones and Mark Burkhalter spoke in favor as well as Fulton County Commissioner Lynne Riley. Lobbyists for Fulton County and City of Atlanta, and Atlanta Dept of Watershed Management Commissioner Robert Hunter spoke against.
, Jan Jones (who lives in the new city of Milton, named for the former county) was the speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the Georgia House, and was expected to make a strong push for the new county. The constitutional amendment would require two-thirds of each house and half of all voters in a statewide referendum to approve the re-creation of former counties (Milton and Campbell). As of October 2021 no proposals have been advanced.

==Geography==
Milton County originally bordered Gwinnett to the southeast, Forsyth to the northeast, Cherokee to the northwest, Cobb to the southwest, and DeKalb (Chamblee and Dunwoody) to the south. Because the Roswell area was formerly located in Cobb County, there was no border between Fulton and Milton counties before 1932. The northern edge of DeKalb also now no longer touches the river, as it did then. This section, north of Dunwoody Club Drive, is now the panhandle of Sandy Springs.

<text>SV Wacker Burghausen is a German football club based in Burghausen, Bavaria and is part of one of the nation&#x27;s largest sports clubs with some 6,000 members participating in two dozen different sports.

==History==

The club was founded on 13 November 1930 and was made up largely of employees from the local chemical factory Wacker Chemie, which was established in 1914, and still sponsors the club today. The first football side in the city was part of the gymnastics club Turnverein Burghausen. In 1922, the footballers left TV to form 1. FC Burghausen which became part of SV at the time of its founding. Besides football, the new club had departments for shooting, athletics, and youth.

SV won the East Bavarian championship just three years later in 1933, but then afterwards toiled in anonymity in the local lower-level leagues until 1993 when they won the Landesliga Bayern-Süd (V) title, followed by the Bayernliga (IV) championship two years later, which advanced the club to the Regionalliga Süd (III). In 2002–03, the team played its way into the 2. Bundesliga where they competed until being relegated at the end of the 2006–07 campaign.

Wacker earned a seventh-place finish in the Regionalliga in 2007–08, which qualified the team for the new 3. Liga the following season. It finished the 2008–09 season in 18th place, on a relegation rank but was saved from having to step down to the Regionalliga by the withdrawal from the league of Kickers Emden for financial reasons.

The club finished in 18th place, on a relegation rank but was saved from having step down to the Regionalliga for a second time by the insolvency of Rot Weiss Ahlen. After good results in 2011–12 and 2012–13 the club finished 19th in the league in 2013–14 and was relegated to the Regionalliga Bayern.

===Reserve team===

The SV Wacker Burghausen II team played in the Bayernliga (IV) from 2005 to 2007, making Burghausen one of the few clubs to have had both first and second teams play at this level. The reserve team finished 15th in the Landesliga Bayern-Süd (VI) in the 2010–11 season, narrowly avoiding relegation. At the end of the 2011–12 season the team qualified directly for the newly expanded Bayernliga after winning the league championship in the Landesliga. It played in the Bayernliga until 2014 when the club decided to withdraw the team from competition at the end of the season.

<doc id="273444" wikidata="Q1336253" url="?curid=273444" title="Phil Donahue">
<text>Phillip John Donahue (December 21, 1935 – August 18, 2024) was an American media personality, writer, film producer, and the creator and host of &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;. The television program, later known simply as &quot;Donahue&quot;, was the first popular talk show to feature a format that included audience participation. The show had a 29-year run on national television that began in Dayton, Ohio, in 1967 and ended in New York City in 1996.

Donahue&#x27;s shows often focused on issues that divide liberals and conservatives in the United States, such as abortion, consumer protection, civil rights, and war issues. His most frequent guest was Ralph Nader, for whom Donahue campaigned in 2000. Donahue also briefly hosted a talk show on MSNBC from July 2002 to February 2003.
Donahue was one of the most influential talk show hosts and was often referred to as the &quot;king of daytime talk&quot;. Oprah Winfrey has said, &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for Phil Donahue, there would never have been an &quot;Oprah Show&quot;.&quot; In 1996, Donahue was ranked 42 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.

==Early life==
Donahue was born on December 21, 1935, into a middle-class, Irish Catholic family in Cleveland, Ohio; his father, Phillip Donahue, was a furniture sales clerk, while his mother, Catherine (née McClory), was a department store shoe clerk. In 1949, he graduated from Our Lady of Angels Elementary School in the West Park neighborhood. In 1953, Donahue was a member of the first graduating class of St. Edward High School, an all-boys college preparatory Catholic private high school in Lakewood, Ohio. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame, with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree, in 1957.

==Career==
===Early career===
Donahue began his career in 1957 as a production assistant at KYW radio and television when that station was in Cleveland. He got a chance to become an announcer one day when the regular announcer failed to show up. After a brief stint as a bank check sorter in Albuquerque, New Mexico, he became program director for WABJ radio in Adrian, Michigan, soon after graduating. He moved on to become a stringer for the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; and later, an anchor of the morning newscast at WHIO-TV in Dayton, Ohio, where his interviews with Jimmy Hoffa and Billie Sol Estes were picked up nationally. While in Dayton, Donahue also hosted &quot;Conversation Piece&quot;, an afternoon phone-in talk show from 1963 to 1967 on WHIO radio. In Dayton, Donahue interviewed presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, late-night talk show host Johnny Carson, human rights activist Malcolm X, and Vietnam war opponents including Jerry Rubin. In Chicago and New York City, Donahue interviewed Elton John, heavyweight boxing champions Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, and author and political activist Noam Chomsky.

===&quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;===
On November 6, 1967, Donahue left WHIO, moving his talk program with &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot; on WLWD (now WDTN), also in Dayton. Initially, the program was shown only on other stations owned by the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation (which would later take the name of its parent Avco Company), which also owned WLWD. But, in January 1970, &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot; entered nationwide syndication. Donahue&#x27;s syndicated show moved from Dayton, Ohio, to Chicago in 1974; then in 1985, he moved the show to New York City.

After a 29-year run—26 years in syndication and nearly 7,000 one-hour daily shows—the final original episode of &quot;Donahue&quot; aired on September 13, 1996.

While hosting his own program, Donahue also appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot; as a contributor, from 1979 until 1988.

===U.S.–Soviet Space Bridge===

In the 1980s, during the Cold War period of openness by the USSR, Donahue and Soviet journalist Vladimir Pozner co-hosted a series of televised discussions, known as the U.S.–Soviet Space Bridge, among everyday citizens of the Soviet Union and the United States. It was the first event of its kind in broadcasting history: Donahue hosted an audience in a U.S. city while Posner hosted an audience in a Soviet city, all on one television program. Members of both audiences asked each other questions about both nations. While the governments of both nations were preparing for the possibility of nuclear war, Donahue said: &quot;We reached out instead of lashed out.&quot; From 1991 to 1994 Donahue and Posner co-hosted &quot;Posner/Donahue&quot;, a weekly, issues-oriented roundtable program, which aired both on CNBC and in syndication.
His wife Marlo Thomas created a children&#x27;s version in 1988 entitled &quot;Free to Be... A Family.&quot; Donahue and Posner became long-time friends after the experience.

===MSNBC program===

In July 2002, Donahue returned to television after seven years of retirement to host a show called &quot;Donahue&quot; on MSNBC. On February 25, 2003, MSNBC canceled the show.
Soon after the show&#x27;s cancellation, an internal MSNBC memo was leaked to the press stating that Donahue should be fired because he opposed the imminent U.S. invasion of Iraq and that he would be a &quot;difficult public face for NBC in a time of war&quot; and that his program could be &quot;a home for the liberal anti-war agenda&quot;. Donahue commented in 2007 that the management of MSNBC, owned at the time by General Electric, a major defense contractor, required that &quot;we have two conservative (guests) for every liberal. I was counted as two liberals.&quot;

===&quot;Body of War&quot;===

In 2006, Donahue served as co-director with independent filmmaker Ellen Spiro for the feature documentary film &quot;Body of War&quot;. The film tells the story of Tomas Young, a severely disabled Iraq War veteran and his turbulent postwar adjustments. In November 2007, the film was named as one of fifteen documentaries to be in consideration for an Oscar nomination from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

==Other appearances==
In June 2013, Donahue and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video showing support for Chelsea Manning. 

Donahue was interviewed for the documentary film &quot;Finding Vivian Maier&quot; (2013), about the posthumously recognized American street photographer and an acquaintance of his from the 1970s.

On May 24 and May 25, 2016, Donahue spoke at Ralph Nader&#x27;s &quot;Breaking Through Power&quot; conference at DAR Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C.

==Honors==

Donahue was nominated for 20 Daytime Emmy Awards during his broadcasting career, winning eight for Outstanding Talk Show Host &quot;The Phil Donahue Show,&quot; as well as receiving both a Special Recognition Award in 1993, and a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. He received the Peabody Award in 1980, and was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame on November 20, 1993.
In 1987, he received the &quot;Maggie&quot; Award, highest honor of the Planned Parenthood Federation, in tribute to their founder, Margaret Sanger. In 2024, Donahue was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Joe Biden.

==Personal life==

Donahue&#x27;s 1958 marriage to Margaret Cooney produced five children – Michael, Kevin, Daniel, Mary Rose, and James – but ended in divorce in 1975. She returned to her native New Mexico, remarried, and retired from public view. The family had lived in Centerville, Ohio, across the street from Erma Bombeck, a humorist who would become one of his contemporaries as a national voice in the 1970s and 1980s. For a brief period in the 1970s, Donahue employed Vivian Maier, an American street photographer, as a nanny for his children. 

Donahue married actress Marlo Thomas on May 21, 1980. He and Thomas had no children together. 

In 1999, Donahue was one of the lead candidates to host the game show &quot;Greed&quot; along with Keith Olbermann, but Chuck Woolery was hired instead.

Regarding his religion, Donahue had stated: &quot;I will always be a Catholic. But I want my church to join the human race and finally walk away from this anti-sexual theology.&quot; He also said that he is not &quot;a very good Catholic&quot;, and that he did not think it was necessary to have his first marriage annulled. He had expressed admiration of Pope Francis.

In early August 2014, Donahue&#x27;s youngest son, James Donahue, died suddenly at the age of 51 due to ruptured aortic aneurysm. 

==Death==
Donahue died following a long illness at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City, on August 18, 2024, at the age of 88. Donahue&#x27;s death was confirmed by a family spokesperson, Susie Arons, who said Donahue died &quot;peacefully following a long illness,&quot; surrounded by family members and &quot;his beloved Golden retriever, Charlie.&quot;

<doc id="273446" wikidata="Q5236365" url="?curid=273446" title="David Lavender">
<text>David Sievert Lavender (February 4, 1910 – April 26, 2003) was an American historian and writer who was one of the most prolific chroniclers of the American West. He published more than 40 books, including two novels, several children&#x27;s books, and a memoir. Unlike his two prominent contemporaries, Bernard DeVoto and Wallace Stegner, Lavender was not an academic. Much of his writing was influenced by his first-hand practical knowledge of the American West and the historical realities and locations depicted in his books—in the mines, on the trails, in the mountains, and on the rivers. Lavender was a two-time nominee for the Pulitzer Prize, and was widely admired by scholars for his accuracy and objectivity.

==Early years==

David Lavender was born and raised on a cattle ranch 20 miles north of Telluride, Colorado, then a fading mining town. During his early years, he worked as a gold miner and a cowboy. His love of the outdoors led to his becoming an avid mountaineer and dedicated conservationist. Although raised in the rustic mountains of western Colorado, Lavender came from a family that highly valued learning and education. His grandfather was a Colorado supreme court judge, and both his parents were college-educated. Lavender attended Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania, and later studied the law and liberal arts at Princeton University.

After graduating in 1931, he briefly attended Stanford Law School before returning to western Colorado to help his stepfather Edgar Lavender run his cattle ranch. After his stepfather died in 1934, he lived on his sizable cattle ranch until the bank repossessed it in 1935. Lavender then moved to Denver, where he worked for an advertising agency and wrote fiction for popular pulp magazines and juvenile publications like &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;.

==Writing career==

In 1939, Lavender moved to Ojai, California, where he took a teaching job. He sold three short stories to &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; and went on to contribute to other publications. He began to write about the American West he had experienced growing up—wanting to record a way of life that he felt was slowly fading away. He began to write about his days working in the Camp Bird Mine near Ouray, Colorado, as a miner. The result was a memoir, &quot;One Man&#x27;s West&quot;, which was published in 1943. That year, Lavender began teaching English at The Thacher School—a boarding school in Ojai—where he encouraged and supported many young writers. Lavender kept his teaching position at the Thacher School until 1970.
The American West of Lavender&#x27;s early years was still a place of ranchers, miners, cowboys, prospectors, and mountaineers—for most men, a world of backbreaking, lonely, and dangerous work. In &quot;One Man&#x27;s West&quot;, however, Lavender did not focus on &quot;the cold and the cruel fatigue&quot;, but instead wrote about the &quot;multitude of tiny things which in their sum make up the elemental poetry of rock and ice and snow&quot;. Lavender felt compelled to document his experiences in rugged southwest Colorado to preserve what he saw as a rapidly disappearing way of life. The book is filled with unique characters and personal stories, narrated in a warm conversational style.

In 1948, Lavender followed up his successful memoir with &quot;The Big Divide&quot;, a history of the Rocky Mountain region that established his reputation as a serious historian. The critical and commercial success of these two books launched Lavender&#x27;s literary career.

In 1954, Lavender published &quot;Bent&#x27;s Fort&quot;, an historic landmark of the American West on the upper Arkansas River in present-day southeastern Colorado. Built by Charles and William Bent, Bent&#x27;s Fort was a massive private fort that stood until 1849 as the center of trade with the Indians of the central plains. Lavender&#x27;s history of these men and their role in opening up the southwestern region of North America has been compared to the works of eminent historians such as Francis Parkman and William H. Prescott.

In 1958, Lavender wrote &quot;The Trail to Santa Fe&quot;, about Zebulon Pike and his exploration of the American Southwest in present-day Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico. The book captures the turbulent adventures of the explorers, traders, and fighters who opened up this new country, and the hardships they faced during their westward expansion into uncharted land along the Santa Fe Trail, which ran from Independence, Missouri, to Santa Fe.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Lavender wrote a series of histories of the American West, including &quot;Red Mountain&quot; in 1963, &quot;Westward Vision: The Story of the Oregon Trail&quot; in 1963, &quot;The Rockies&quot; in 1968 (Harper &amp; Row), and &quot;The American West&quot; in 1969.

In the 1980s, Lavender expanded his focus as an historian, writing about the Pacific Northwest in &quot;Fort Vancouver&quot; (1981), Wyoming in &quot;Fort Laramie&quot; (1984), Utah and Arizona in &quot;Colorado River Country&quot; (1982) and &quot;River Runners of the Grand Canyon&quot; (1985), California in &quot;California: A Place, a People, a Dream&quot; (1986) and &quot;California: Land of New Beginnings&quot; (1987), and Colorado in &quot;The Telluride Story&quot; (1987). He also produced general histories of the American West in &quot;Overland Migrations&quot; (1981), &quot;Colorado River Country&quot; (1982), &quot;The Great West&quot; (1985), &quot;The Way to the Western Sea&quot; (1988), and the &quot;American Heritage History of the West&quot; (1988).

In 1992, Lavender published &quot;Let Me Be Free: The Nez Percé Tragedy&quot; (1992), the tragic story of the Nez Percé Indians&#x27; flight from their homeland to Canada to escape the United States cavalry. The clash between European-Americans and the American Indians was a subject Lavender covered in many of his previous works.
In the last decade of his life, Lavender focused his writing on the American Southwest. His books &quot;De Soto, Coronado, Cabrillo: Explorers of the Northern Mystery&quot; (1992), &quot;The Santa Fe Trail&quot; (1995), &quot;Pipe Spring and the Arizona Strip&quot; (1997), &quot;Mother Earth, Father Sky: Pueblo Indians of the American Southwest&quot; (1998), and &quot;Climax at Buena Vista: The Decisive Battle of the Mexican-American War&quot; (2003) all contributed to documenting the history of the region.

== Honors and awards ==

Lavender was twice nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. He received numerous awards for his work, including awards from &quot;American Heritage&quot; and the Western Writers of America. He received two Guggenheim Fellowships to study the fur trade, and the Commonwealth Club of California gave him four medals for his histories of Colorado, the Pacific Northwest, early San Francisco, and the Lewis and Clark expedition. In 1997, he received the Wallace Stegner Award from the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado.

== Personal life ==

In the early 1930s, Lavender married Martha Bloom, who gave birth to their only son David G. Lavender in 1934. After his wife died in 1959, he married his second wife, Mildred Moreland, and they remained together for 25 years before she too died. In 1990, on his 80th birthday, Lavender married his third wife, Muriel Sharkey, whom he first got to know on a river trip through the Grand Canyon. In 2003, his health began to fail. Lavender died of natural causes at his home in Ojai, California on April 26, 2003, at the age of 93. He was survived by his wife Muriel, his son David, and numerous grandchildren, stepchildren, and great-grandchildren.

<text>Miya Masaoka (born 1958, Washington, D.C.) is an American composer, musician, and sound artist active in the field of contemporary classical music and experimental music. Her work encompasses contemporary classical composition, improvisation, electroacoustic music, inter-disciplinary sound art, sound installation, traditional Japanese instruments, and performance art. She is based in New York City.
Masaoka often performs on a 21-string Japanese koto (musical instrument), which she extends with software processing, string preparations, and bowing. She has created performance works and installations incorporating plants, live insects, and sensor technology. Her full-length ballet was performed at the Venice Biennale 2004. She has been awarded the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship (2021), the Doris Duke Award (2013) and the Herb Alpert Award (2004), and a Fulbright Fellowship for advanced research for Noh, gagaku and the ichi gen kin. She is an associate professor in the MFA Visual Arts Department at Columbia University, and the director of the MFA Sound Art Program.

==Early life and education==
Masaoka began studying classical music at eight years old. In her early 20s, she moved to Paris, France, and upon returning to the US, she enrolled at San Francisco State University, and received her BA in Music, magna cum laude, where she studied with Wayne Peterson and Eric Moe. She holds an MA from Mills College where she received the Faculty Award in Music Composition. Her teachers included Alvin Curran, Maryanne Amacher and David Tudor.

==Biography==
Masaoka&#x27;s work spans many genres and media. She has created works for voice, orchestra, installations, electronics and film shorts. She has sewn and soldered handmade responsive garments (LED KIMONO) and mapped the movement of insects and response of plants and brain activity to sound (Pieces For Plants, The Sound of Naked Men, Thinking Sounds).

Her works have been commissioned and premiered by Bang on a Can, So Percussion, Either/Or, Kathleen Supove, Joan Jeanrenaud, SF Sound, Volti, Rova Saxophone Quartet, Alonzo King’s Ballet, The Del Sol String Quartet and others. Her orchestral work “Other Mountain” was selected for a reading by JCOI Earshot for the La Jolla Symphony 2013.

She founded and directed the San Francisco Gagaku Society (1989-1996) under the tutelage of Master Suenobu Togi, a former Japanese Imperial Court musician who traced his gagaku lineage more than 1000 years to the Tang Dynasty.

Her love of nature and resonant outdoor space led her to record the migrating birds in the deep and naturally resonant canyons near the San Diego Airport, resulting in the work “For Birds, Planes and Cello,” written for Joan Jeanrenaud, formerly of Kronos Quartet. “While I Was Walking, I Heard a Sound” is scored for 120 singers, spatialized in balconies of the concert hall. During one movement, three choirs and nine opera singers are making bird calls and environmental sounds.

As a kotoist, she remains active in improvisation and has performed and recorded with Pharoah Sanders, Pauline Oliveros, Gerry Hemingway, Jon Rose, Fred Frith, Larry Ochs and Maybe Monday, Steve Coleman, Anthony Braxton, Reggie Workman, Dr. L. Subramaniam, Andrew Cyrille, George E. Lewis, Jin Hi Kim, Susie Ibarra, Vijay Iyer, Myra Melford, Zeena Parkins, Toshiko Akiyoshi, William Parker, Robert Dick, Lukas Ligeti, Earl Howard, Henry Brant and many others.

Masaoka describes herself, saying, “I am deeply moved by the sounds and kinetic energy of the natural world. People, history, memory, this geography and soundscape of nature and culture --from our human heart beat to the rhythms of the moon and oceans-- how infinitely complex yet so fundamental.” 

She initiated and founded the San Francisco Electronic Music Festival in 1999.

In 2004, Masaoka received an Alpert Award in the Arts, and she previously was given a National Endowment for the Arts and a Wallace Alexander Gerbode Award.

The New York Times describes her solo performances as “exploring the extremes of her instrument,” and The Wire describes her own compositions as “magnificent…virtuosic…essential music…” 

She has been a faculty member at the Milton Avery Graduate Program at Bard College in Music/Sound since 2002, and has taught music composition at NYU. She received the Doris Duke Performing Artist Award in 2013, and a Fulbright Scholarship for Japan, 2016.

<doc id="273450" wikidata="Q39659" url="?curid=273450" title="Jacques Santer">
<text>Jacques Santer (born 18 May 1937) is a Luxembourgish politician who served as the ninth president of the European Commission from 1995 to 1999. He served as the finance minister of Luxembourg from 1979 until 1989, and the 22nd prime minister of Luxembourg from 1984 to 1995, as a member of the Christian Social People&#x27;s Party (CSV), which was the leading party in the Luxembourg government between 1979 and 2013. As Prime Minister of Luxembourg he also led the negotiations on the Single European Act, which effectively set aside the 20-year-old Luxembourg Compromise.

== Career ==
He graduated in 1959 from the Paris Institute of Political Studies, and received his doctorate in law in 1961. From 1972 to 1974 he was a junior minister in the government. From 1979 to 1984 he was Minister of Finance, Minister for Work and Minister for Social Security, under Pierre Werner, in the coalition government between the Christian Social People&#x27;s Party (CSV) and the liberal Democratic Party.

After the general election of 1984, Pierre Werner retired as prime minister and from political life in general, and Santer became the new prime minister. He and the CSV now formed a new coalition with the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (LSAP), which had come out of the elections as the second-largest party in the legislature, beating the Democratic Party into third place; the CSV remained the largest party. This CSV/LSAP coalition was to last until 1999.

On 10 November 1990 an article appeared in the newspaper &quot;vum Lëtzebuerger Vollek&quot;, which translates into &quot;Five years of state secret – The bombing NATO terror commando&quot; that caused a parliament inquiry in which Santer was forced to reveal the existence of a stay-behind army in Luxembourg and being politically responsible to call for its dissolution. The organisation was active since its creation by the then prime minister Pierre Werner in 1959 and was organised by the secret service of Luxembourg, the Service de Renseignement de l&#x27;Etat (SREL) and coordinated by the NATO. On 17 December 1990 he told the constitutional committee the organisation had never more than 12 members and was only foreseen to handle intelligence operations, as well as escape and evasion manoeuvers. There were weapons caches established in 1973, but direct access would not have been granted, according to Santer. On 14 October 1990 the remaining members of the organisation were informed and requested to return their radio communication equipment.

=== Presidency of the European Commission ===

Santer became the ninth President of the European Commission in 1995 as a compromise choice between the United Kingdom and a Franco-German alliance, after the Franco-German nominee Jean-Luc Dehaene was vetoed by British prime minister John Major. Santer&#x27;s selection was barely ratified by a European Parliament upset with the process for which Commission presidents are selected.

In the same year, 1995, Santer became the first recipient of the Vision for Europe Award.

Allegations of corruption concerning individual EU-commissioners led to an investigation into administrative failings (incompetence and malpractice) by a so-called Committee of Independent Experts. Despite clearing most commissioners, the report stated that they had not found a single person showing the slightest sense of responsibility. Because the implicated commissioners refused to resign and the President of the European Commission did not have the power to dismiss individual commissioners, Santer and his entire commission resigned on 15 March 1999, the very day of the report&#x27;s publication. As the Commission would only have lasted for half a year from then, he was replaced by Vice-President Manuel Marín on an interim basis.

=== Later career ===

From 1999 until 2004, Santer was a member of the European Parliament. He also was on General Mediterranean Holdings&#x27; board, a financial holding owned by Anglo-Iraqi Nadhmi Auchi.

He is currently President of Group Europe, a member section of the Union of European Federalists. He also sits on the board of directors of RTL Group, an international TV broadcasting and production company.

On Monday 23 January 2012, Jacques Santer was appointed to head the board of the Special Purpose Investment Vehicle (SPIV), which is designed to boost the firepower of the European Financial Stability Facility, the eurozone rescue fund.

In May 2013, Santer became Honorary Member of SME Europe, the official pro-business organisation of the European People&#x27;s Party.

<doc id="273453" wikidata="Q845457" url="?curid=273453" title="Palmchat">
<text>The palmchat (Dulus dominicus) is a small, long-tailed passerine bird, the only species in the genus Dulus and the family Dulidae endemic to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola (split between the Dominican Republic and Haiti). It is related to the waxwings, family Bombycillidae. Its name reflects its strong association with palms for feeding, roosting, and nesting.

The palmchat is the national bird of the Dominican Republic.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the palmchat in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected from the French colony of Saint-Domingue, modern Haiti. He used the French name &quot;Le tangara de S. Dominigue&quot; and the Latin &quot;Tangara Dominicensis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition in 1766, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson, with one of them being the palmchat. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Tanagra dominica&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work.

The palmchat is the only species placed in the genus &quot;Dulus&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The species is monotypic.

==Description==
Palmchats are about in length. They are olive-brown above, and heavily streaked with brown below. Their rumps, as well as the edges of their primary feathers, are dark yellow-green. They have strong yellow bills and russet eyes. They lack the soft silky plumage of the waxwings or silky-flycatchers. Adults show no sexual dimorphism; immature birds have dark throats.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is endemic to the island of Hispaniola (in both Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and the adjacent Saona and Gonâve Islands, where it is common and widespread. It inhabits areas from sea level to 1500 m asl where palm savannas can be found, or other open areas with scattered trees. Where its food trees are present, it has adapted well to city parks and gardens.

==Behaviour==
Palmchats are very sociable birds, often seen in small flocks containing several pairs, which will roost closely together with their bodies in contact.

===Breeding===
The breeding season is mainly from March to June. The birds build large, messy, communal nests of twigs in the crowns of palms (mainly Puerto Rico royal palms, &quot;Roystonea borinquena&quot;). Occasionally, in the absence of palms, other trees or even telephone poles may be used. The whole nesting structure may be up to 2 m across, containing up to 30 adjoining nests with their own separate chambers and entrances. The females lay clutches of 2-4 thickly spotted, grey-purple eggs.

===Food===
Palmchats feed on fruits and berries, including those of palms and of the gumbo-limbo tree, as well as on flowers, especially those of epiphytic orchids.

===Voice===
They are voluble and noisy birds, with a large repertoire of gurgling and cheeping sounds constantly used in their social behaviour.
With their loud whistles, they are able to imitate the calls of hawks and kestrels which may be a surprise coming from their tiny bodies. They are typically classified as song birds, but hardly ever make a coherent song.

==Conservation==
The palmchat is a common species within its range of about , and highly adaptable. As it is not approaching the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), it has been evaluated as being of Least Concern.

<text>Campbell County was a county of the U.S. state of Georgia from to . It was created by the state legislature on December 20, 1828, from land taken from Fayette, Coweta, and Carroll counties, and from the half of DeKalb County which became Fulton County soon afterward. Georgia&#x27;s Cherokee Land Lottery of 1832 also added to the county. The county was named for Duncan G. Campbell, one of the U.S. commissioners responsible for the Treaty of Indian Springs.

The original county seat was Campbellton. In 1854 the Atlanta and West Point Railroad]] routed it&#x27;s tracks]] through Fairburn, Georgia instead, which flourished while Campbellton died out, and Fairburn became the county seat in 1870. The Campbell County Courthouse at Fairburn is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The northwestern half of Campbell (and a bit more of Carroll) became Douglas County in 1870, divided on October 17 at the Chattahoochee River. The remainder of Campbell County was ceded to Fulton County at the end of 1931, along with Milton County, Georgia The legislation creating the merger was enacted on August 9, 1929, with Milton being added to the process in 1931.

<doc id="273456" wikidata="Q1305705" url="?curid=273456" title="The Love Bug">
<text>The Love Bug (also known as Herbie the Love Bug) is a 1968 American sports adventure comedy film directed by Robert Stevenson from a screenplay by Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, based on the story &quot;Car, Boy, Girl&quot; by Gordon Buford. The film is the first installment in the &quot;Herbie&quot; film series.

The film follows the adventures of a sentient Volkswagen Beetle named Herbie, Herbie&#x27;s driver, Jim Douglas (Dean Jones), and Jim&#x27;s love interest, Carole Bennett (Michele Lee). It also features Buddy Hackett as Jim&#x27;s enlightened, kind-hearted friend, Tennessee Steinmetz, a character who creates &quot;art&quot; from used car parts. English actor David Tomlinson portrays the villainous Peter Thorndyke, the owner of an automobile showroom and an SCCA national champion who sells Herbie to Jim and eventually becomes his racing rival.

&quot;The Love Bug&quot; was followed by a sequel titled &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot; (1974). The film was originally given a limited release on December 24, 1968, and was later widely released on March 13, 1969 by Walt Disney Productions. It received positive reviews from critics, and received $51.2 million against a budget of $5 million.

==Plot==

Jim Douglas is a once-prominent race car driver now relegated to participating in demolition derbies, often competing against much younger challengers. Residing in a converted firehouse overlooking San Francisco Bay, Jim shares his abode with Tennessee Steinmetz, an eccentric mechanic and sculptor whose artistic creations repurpose discarded automobile components.

Jim’s fortunes shift when he visits a luxurious European car dealership, where he encounters Carole Bennett, a capable mechanic and sales associate, as well as Peter Thorndyke, the imperious British proprietor of the establishment. During this visit, Jim notices a peculiar Volkswagen Beetle—a vehicle Thorndyke openly abuses after it is returned to the showroom under mysterious circumstances. Lacking the financial means to procure a vehicle, Jim departs, only to find that the enigmatic Beetle follows him home. This uninvited acquisition leads to a police intervention on charges of grand theft, forcing Jim to reluctantly agree to a lease-purchase arrangement for the unconventional car.

Initially, Jim is disenchanted with the Beetle, whose idiosyncratic behavior includes avoiding highways and orchestrating encounters with Carole. Suspecting Thorndyke of duping him with a malfunctioning vehicle, Jim remains skeptical until Tennessee discerns the truth: the car possesses sentience. Endearing himself to the Beetle, Tennessee christens the car “Herbie”.

Jim and Herbie soon venture into the competitive world of racing. Despite Thorndyke’s scorn, Herbie secures an unexpected victory in his debut race, followed by a triumph over Thorndyke himself at Riverside Raceway, thereby solidifying Jim’s ownership of the remarkable car. A series of successive wins frustrates Thorndyke, who becomes increasingly desperate to unearth the source of Jim and Herbie’s success. Resorting to sabotage, Thorndyke clandestinely compromises Herbie’s performance on the eve of an important race, resulting in a crushing defeat. Disillusioned, Jim decides to replace Herbie with a brand-new Lamborghini, a decision that alienates both Carole and Tennessee, who had come to appreciate Herbie’s unique qualities.

Feeling betrayed, Herbie reacts by vandalizing the Lamborghini and fleeing. His escapades culminate in an attempt to leap from the Golden Gate Bridge, prompting Jim to intervene and reconcile with the emotionally distressed car. At the police station, Tang Wu, a racing enthusiast and local businessman whose property Herbie inadvertently damaged, offers to drop charges in exchange for ownership of Herbie. Wu proposes a deal: Jim and Tennessee may race Herbie in the prestigious El Dorado Road race, with the agreement that ownership reverts to Jim upon their victory.

The El Dorado race, a grueling two-day event traversing the Sierra Nevada, becomes the stage for Thorndyke’s underhanded tactics. Despite these obstacles, Jim, Carole, and Tennessee persevere, although the first leg of the race leaves Herbie in a battered state, limping across the finish line using a makeshift wagon wheel. Overnight, Herbie’s condition worsens, leading Wu to reveal a secondary agreement with Thorndyke that jeopardizes Herbie’s future. When Thorndyke attempts to forcibly seize the car, Herbie unexpectedly springs back to life, driving Thorndyke away in terror.

On the final leg, Herbie overcomes numerous challenges, employing ingenuity and resilience to regain his position. As they near the finish line, Herbie dramatically splits in two due to mechanical strain. In a comedic twist, his rear half, carrying Tennessee and the engine, crosses the finish line first, while his front half, with Jim and Carole aboard, follows closely, securing both first and third place.

In the aftermath, Wu assumes control of Thorndyke’s dealership, appoints Tennessee as his assistant, and relegates Thorndyke to the mechanics’ workshop alongside his accomplice. Restored to his former glory, Herbie serves as the vehicle for Jim and Carole’s departure, whisking the newlyweds away on their honeymoon.

==Production notes==

===Story and development===
Dean Jones credited the film&#x27;s success to the fact that it was the last live-action film produced by Walt Disney Productions under Walt Disney&#x27;s involvement, released just two years after his death in 1966. Although Jones tried to pitch him a serious, straightforward film project concerning the story of the first sports car ever brought to the United States, Walt suggested a different car story for him, which was &quot;Car, Boy, Girl&quot;, a story written in 1961 by Gordon Buford.

&quot;Car, Boy, Girl;&quot; &quot;The Magic Volksy;&quot; &quot;The Runaway Wagen;&quot; &quot;Beetlebomb;&quot; &quot;Wonderbeetle;&quot; &quot;Bugboom&quot; and &quot;Thunderbug&quot; were among the original development titles considered for the film before the title was finalized as &quot;The Love Bug.&quot;

Herbie competes in the Monterey Grand Prix, which, except for 1963, was not a sports car race. The actual sports car race held at Monterey was the Monterey Sports Car Championships. The 1968 Monterey Grand Prix was in fact a Can Am Series race and did not feature production cars.

Peter Thorndyke&#x27;s yellow &quot;Special&quot; is actually a 1965 Apollo GT, a rare sports car sold by International Motorcars of Oakland, California. It used an Italian-built body and chassis from Intermeccanica paired with a small-block Buick V8 engine that was installed in Oakland. This car exists today, is in the hands of a private collector, and has been restored as it was seen in the film with its yellow paint and number 14 logo.

===&quot;Herbie&quot;===
Before the film entered production, the titular car was not specified as a Volkswagen Beetle, and Disney set up a casting call for a dozen cars to audition. In the lineup, there were a few Toyotas, a TVR, a handful of Volvos, an MG and a pearl white Volkswagen Beetle. The Volkswagen Beetle was chosen as it was the only one that elicited the crew to reach out and pet it.

The Volkswagen brand name, logo or shield does not feature anywhere in the film, as the automaker did not permit Disney to use the name. The only logos can be briefly seen in at least two places, however. The first instance is on the brake pedals during the first scene where Herbie takes control with Jim inside (on the freeway when Herbie runs into Thorndyke&#x27;s Rolls-Royce), and it is shown in all the future scenes when Jim is braking. The second instance is on the ignition key, when Jim tries to shut down the braking Herbie. The subsequent films, however, do promote the Volkswagen name (as sales of the Beetle were down when the sequels were produced). The VW &quot;Wolfsburg&quot; castle emblem on the steering wheel hub is also seen throughout the car&#x27;s interior shots. Within the script, the car was only ever referred to as &quot;Herbie&quot;, &quot;the little car&quot; or &quot;the Bug&quot;—the latter, although a common nickname for the Beetle, was not trademarked by Volkswagen at the time of filming. Volkswagen was nervous of many of the scenes that showed Herbie apparently falling apart or malfunctioning - and thus carefully scrutinized the script of the film ensuring that it did not show the car in a negative light - allegedly sending teams of lawyers to the Disney studios on a regular basis to oversee the production.

The car was later given the name &quot;Herbie&quot; from one of Buddy Hackett&#x27;s skits about a ski instructor named Klaus, who speaks with a German accent as he introduces his fellow ski instructors, who are named Hans, Fritz, Wilhelm, and Sandor. At the end of the skit, Hackett would say &quot;If you ain&#x27;t got a Herbie (pronounced &quot;&quot;hoy-bee&quot;), I ain&#x27;t going.&quot;

Herbie&#x27;s trademark &quot;53&quot; racing number was chosen by producer Bill Walsh, who was a fan of Los Angeles Dodgers baseball player Don Drysdale (Drysdale&#x27;s jersey number, later retired by the team, was 53).

Walsh also gave Herbie his trademark red, white and blue racing stripes presumably for the more patriotic color and came up with the film&#x27;s gags such as Herbie squirting oil and opening the doors by himself.

Benson Fong, who played Mr. Wu, said that when he and the others were dragged along the dirt by Herbie, it was like being pulled by 40 horses. The 1961–1965 Volkswagen Beetles actually were rated by the SAE at in factory configuration (though only by the European DIN system which measured engine output as installed in the car with cooling fan and exhaust system attached).

Herbie has his own cast billing in the closing credits, the only time this was done in the entire series of films.

Today, only a handful of the original Herbie cars are known to exist. Car #10 was recovered from a warehouse in Pennsylvania and has been preserved—still sporting its original paint from the film.

===Deleted scenes===
The bonuses on the DVD provide two deleted scenes named &quot;Used Car Lot&quot; and &quot;Playground&quot;.

A scene shot but not included in the final cut of the film, featured Jim calling at a used car lot prior to his visiting Thorndyke&#x27;s auto showroom. This missing sequence has long since been lost, and all that remains is the script and a single black and white photograph of Jim talking with the salesman at the lot.

An unfilmed scene at the end of the story that was scripted and storyboarded was to have shown Herbie playing with children at a nearby playground prior to taking the newly married Jim and Carole off on their honeymoon.

===Stock footage===
The opening scene of the demolition derby cars is stock footage from the film &quot;Fireball 500&quot; (1966). Parts of this scene can also be found in a 1966-model year dealer promotional film by Chevrolet, titled &quot;Impact &#x27;66&quot;.

===Shooting locations===
Some of the racetrack scenes were shot at the Riverside International Raceway in Riverside, California. Others were filmed at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey, California, Willow Springs Raceway in Willow Springs, California and Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills, California. Additional scenes depicting the El Dorado race were filmed near the San Bernardino Mountains in Big Bear City, California.

===Cast and crew===
Andy Granatelli, who was popular at the time as a presence at the Indianapolis 500 as well as the spokesman for STP, appears as himself as the racing association president. Announcer Gary Owens (of &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; fame) and Los Angeles Lakers play-by-play man Chick Hearn also appear as themselves.

The driving scenes were choreographed by veteran stunt man Carey Loftin.
Drivers in the film billed in the opening credits include Dale Van Sickel, Reg Parton, Regina Parton, Tom Bamford, Bob Drake, Marion J. Playan, Hall Brock, Bill Hickman, Rex Ramsay, Hal Grist, Lynn Grate, Larry Schmitz, Richard Warlock, Dana Derfus, Everett Creach, Gerald Jann, Bill Couch, Ted Duncan, Robert Hoys, Gene Roscoe, Jack Mahoney, Charles Willis, Richard Brill, Roy Butterfield, Rudy Doucette, J.J. Wilson, Jim McCullough, Bud Ekins, Glenn Wilder, Gene Curtis, Robert James, John Timanus, Bob Harris, Fred Krone, Richard Ceary, Jesse Wayne, Jack Perkins, Fred Stromsoe, Ronnie Rondell, and Kim Brewer.

===Promotion===
During one scene in the film, Herbie has lost one of his wheels, and Tennessee is hanging out of the passenger side door to balance him. The door opens, and there is no &quot;53&quot; logo on the door. This image was used heavily to promote the film.

==Reception==
&quot;The Love Bug&quot; was the second highest-grossing film of 1969, earning over $51.2 million at the domestic box office. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, later earning a 78% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating from 18 critics on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out to 100, based on 7 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; panned the film as &quot;a long, sentimental Volkswagen commercial ... which has the form of fantasy-comedy, lots of not-very-special effects and no real humor.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;For sheer inventiveness of situation and the charm that such an idea projects, &#x27;The Love Bug&#x27; rates as one of the better entries of the Disney organization.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it

brisk, active, bright, technically impeccable, simple-minded, full of tricky effects and free of all but the most glancing resemblances to nasty old reality. It is a formula picture, and such troubles as there are arise mainly from the fact that the formula has known much stronger ingredients (Fred MacMurray and flubber, let&#x27;s say) in the past.

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; declared that &quot;this very engaging mechanical fantasy is the best piece of work from the Disney studios for some time. The caper appears to have had the effect of injecting life into Robert Stevenson&#x27;s usually pedestrian style, since with the exception of one glutinously sentimental episode the pace never lets up.&quot;

==Comic book adaptation==
* Gold Key: &quot;The Love Bug&quot; (June 1969)

==Legacy==
Four theatrical sequels followed: &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot;, &quot;Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo&quot;, &quot;Herbie Goes Bananas&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Some parts of the racing sequences from the film were later reused for Herbie&#x27;s dream sequence in &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot;, responding to Grandma Steinmetz&#x27;s telling Willoughby Whitfield that Herbie used to be a famous race car.

A five-episode television series, titled &quot;Herbie, the Love Bug&quot;, aired on CBS in the United States in 1982. Directed by Vincent McEveety, the series acted as a continuation of the films, with Dean Jones reprising his role as Jim Douglas. In 1997, there was a made-for-television sequel which included a Dean Jones cameo, tying it to the previous films. The most recent sequel, &quot;&quot;, was released on June 22, 2005, by Walt Disney Pictures.

At Disney&#x27;s All-Star Movies Resort at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, Herbie has been immortalized in the &quot;Love Bug&quot; buildings 6 and 7.

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS on March 4, 1980. It was re-released on November 6, 1985, September 11, 1991, and on October 28, 1994, with &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot;. It was soon re-released again on September 16, 1997, along with the entire &quot;Herbie the Love Bug&quot; film series. It was released on DVD for the first time on May 20, 2003. It was released again with its sequels in a four-movie collection in 2012. A 45th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray Disc was released on December 16, 2014, as a Disney Movie Club exclusive title.

<text>Social realism is work produced by painters, printmakers, photographers, writers and filmmakers that aims to draw attention to the real socio-political conditions of the working class as a means to critique the power structures behind these conditions. While the movement&#x27;s characteristics vary from nation to nation, it almost always uses a form of descriptive or critical realism.

The term is sometimes more narrowly used for an art movement that flourished in the interwar period as a reaction to the hardships and problems suffered by common people after the Great Crash. In order to make their art more accessible to a wider audience, artists turned to realist portrayals of anonymous workers as well as celebrities as heroic symbols of strength in the face of adversity. The goal of the artists in doing so was political as they wished to expose the deteriorating conditions of the poor and working classes and hold the existing governmental and social systems accountable.

Social realism should not be confused with socialist realism, the official Soviet art form that was institutionalized by Joseph Stalin in 1934 and was later adopted by allied Communist parties worldwide. It is also different from realism as it not only presents conditions of the poor, but does so by conveying the tensions between two opposing forces, such as between farmers and their feudal lord. However, sometimes the terms social realism and socialist realism are used interchangeably.

==Origins==
Social realism, as an art movement that became prominent in the US between the two world wars, as a reaction to the increasing hardship for ordinary people, was influenced by the social realist tradition in France which had existed for decades.

Social realism traces back to 19th-century European Realism, including the art of Honoré Daumier, Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet. Britain&#x27;s Industrial Revolution aroused concern for the poor, and in the 1870s the work of artists such as Luke Fildes, Hubert von Herkomer, Frank Holl, and William Small were widely reproduced in &quot;The Graphic&quot;.

In Russia, Peredvizhniki or &quot;Social Realism&quot; was critical of the social environment that caused the conditions pictured, and denounced the Tsarist period. Ilya Repin said that his art work aimed &quot;to criticize all the monstrosities of our vile society&quot; of the Tsarist period. Similar concerns were addressed in 20th-century Britain by the Artists&#x27; International Association, Mass Observation and the Kitchen sink school.

Social realist photography draws from the documentary traditions of the late 19th century, such as the work of Jacob A. Riis, and Maksim Dmitriyev.

===Ashcan school===

In about 1900, a group of Realist artists led by Robert Henri challenged the American Impressionism and academics, in what would become known as the Ashcan school. The term was suggested by a drawing by George Bellows, captioned &quot;Disappointments of the Ash Can&quot;, which appeared in the &quot;Philadelphia Record&quot; in April 1915.

In paintings, illustrations, etchings, and lithographs, Ashcan artists concentrated on portraying New York&#x27;s vitality, with a keen eye on current events and the era&#x27;s social and political rhetoric. H. Barbara Weinberg of The Metropolitan Museum of Art has described the artists as documenting &quot;an unsettling, transitional time that was marked by confidence and doubt, excitement and trepidation. Ignoring or registering only gently harsh new realities such as the problems of immigration and urban poverty, they shone a positive light on their era.&quot;

Notable Ashcan works include George Luks&#x27; &quot;Breaker Boy&quot; and John Sloan&#x27;s &quot;Sixth Avenue Elevated at Third Street&quot;. The Ashcan school influenced the art of the Depression era, including Thomas Hart Benton&#x27;s mural &quot;City Activity with Subway&quot;.

==Art movement==
The term dates on a broader scale to the Realist movement in French art during the mid-19th century. Social realism in the 20th century refers to the works of the French artist Gustave Courbet and in particular to the implications of his 19th-century paintings &quot;A Burial At Ornans&quot; and &quot;The Stone Breakers&quot;, which scandalized French Salon–goers of 1850, and is seen as an international phenomenon also traced back to European realism and the works of Honoré Daumier and Jean-François Millet. The social realist style fell out of fashion in the 1960s but is still influential in thinking and the art of today.

In the more limited meaning of the term, Social Realism with roots in European Realism became an important art movement during the Great Depression in the United States in the 1930s. As an American artistic movement it is closely related to American scene painting and to Regionalism. American Social Realism includes the works of such artists as those from the Ashcan School including Edward Hopper, and Thomas Hart Benton, Will Barnet, Ben Shahn, Jacob Lawrence, Paul Meltsner, Romare Bearden, Rafael Soyer, Isaac Soyer, Moses Soyer, Reginald Marsh, John Steuart Curry, Arnold Blanch, Aaron Douglas, Grant Wood, Horace Pippin, Walt Kuhn, Isabel Bishop, Paul Cadmus, Doris Lee, Philip Evergood, Mitchell Siporin, Robert Gwathmey, Adolf Dehn, Harry Sternberg, Gregorio Prestopino, Louis Lozowick, William Gropper, Philip Guston, Jack Levine, Ralph Ward Stackpole, John Augustus Walker and others. It also extends to the art of photography as exemplified by the works of Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Margaret Bourke-White, Lewis Hine, Edward Steichen, Gordon Parks, Arthur Rothstein, Marion Post Wolcott, Doris Ulmann, Berenice Abbott, Aaron Siskind, and Russell Lee among several others.

In Mexico, the painter Frida Kahlo is associated with the social realism movement. Also in Mexico was the Mexican muralist movement that took place primarily in the 1920s and 1930s; and was an inspiration to many artists north of the border and an important component of the social realism movement. The Mexican muralist movement is characterized by its political undertones, the majority of which are of a Marxist nature, and the social and political situation of post-revolutionary Mexico. Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco, and Rufino Tamayo are the best known proponents of the movement. Santiago Martínez Delgado, Jorge González Camarena, Roberto Montenegro, Federico Cantú Garza, and Jean Charlot, as well as several other artists participated in the movement.

Many artists who subscribed to social realism were painters with socialist (but not necessarily Marxist) political views. The movement therefore has some commonalities with the socialist realism used in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, but the two are not identicalsocial realism is not an &quot;official art,&quot; and allows space for subjectivity. In certain contexts, socialist realism has been described as a specific branch of social realism.

Social realism has been summarized as follows:


==In the United States==

Social realism in the United States was inspired by the muralists active in Mexico after the Mexican Revolution of 1910.

===Farm Security Administration project===
Social realist photography reached a culmination in the work of Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, Ben Shahn, and others for the Farm Security Administration (FSA) project, from 1935 to 1943.

After World War I, the booming U.S. farm economy collapsed from overproduction, falling prices, unfavorable weather, and increased mechanization. Many farm laborers were out of work and many small farming operations were forced into debt. Debt-ridden farms were foreclosed by the thousands, and sharecroppers and tenant farmers were turned from the land. When Franklin D. Roosevelt entered office in 1932, almost two million farm families lived in poverty, and millions of acres of farm land had been ruined from soil erosion and poor farming practices.

The FSA was a New Deal agency designed to combat rural poverty during this period. The agency hired photographers to provide visual evidence that there was a need, and that FSA programs were meeting that need. Ultimately this mission accounted for over 80,000 black and white images, and is now considered one of the most famous documentary photography projects ever.

===WPA and Treasury art projects===

The Public Works of Art Project was a program to employ artists during the Great Depression. It was the first such program, running from December 1933 to June 1934. It was headed by Edward Bruce, under the United States Treasury Department and funded by the Civil Works Administration.

Created in 1935, the Works Progress Administration was the largest and most ambitious New Deal agency, employing millions of unemployed people (mostly unskilled men) to carry out public works projects, including the construction of public buildings and roads. In much smaller but more famous projects the WPA employed musicians, artists, writers, actors and directors in large arts, drama, media, and literacy projects. Many of the artists employed under the WPA are associated with social realism. Social realism became an important art movement during the Great Depression in the United States in the 1930s. As an American artistic movement encouraged by New Deal art, social realism is closely related to American scene painting and to Regionalism.

In Mexico, the painter Frida Kahlo is associated with the social realism movement. The Mexican muralist movement that took place primarily in the 1920s and 1930s was an inspiration to many artists north of the border and an important component of the social realism movement. The Mexican muralist movement is characterized by its political undertones, the majority of which are of a Marxist nature, and the social and political situation of post-revolutionary Mexico. Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco, and Rufino Tamayo are the best known proponents of the movement. Santiago Martínez Delgado, Jorge González Camarena, Roberto Montenegro, Federico Cantú Garza, and Jean Charlot, as well as several other artists participated in the movement.

Many artists who subscribed to social realism were painters with socialist (but not necessarily Marxist) political views. The movement therefore has some commonalities with the Socialist Realism used in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, but the two are not identicalSocial Realism is not an &quot;official art,&quot; and allows space for subjectivity. In certain contexts, socialist realism has been described as a specific branch of social realism.

=== World-War II to present ===
With the onset of abstract expressionism in the 1940s, social realism had gone out of fashion. Several WPA artists found work with the United States Office of War Information during WWII, making posters and other visual materials for the war effort. After the war, although lacking attention in the art market, many social realist artists continued their careers into the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and into the 2000s; throughout which, artists such as Jacob Lawrence, Ben Shahn, Bernarda Bryson Shahn, Raphael Soyer, Robert Gwathmey, Antonio Frasconi, Philip Evergood, Sidney Goodman, and Aaron Berkman continued to work with social realist modalities and themes.

Whether in and out of fashion, social realism and socially conscious art-making continues today within the contemporary art world, including artists Sue Coe, Mike Alewitz, Kara Walker, Celeste Dupuy Spencer, Allan Sekula, Fred Lonidier, and others.

==Gallery==
==In Latin America==
Muralists active in Mexico after the Mexican Revolution of 1910 created largely propagandizing murals which emphasized a revolutionary spirit and a pride in the traditions of the indigenous peoples of Mexico, and included Diego Rivera&#x27;s &quot;History of Mexico from the Conquest to the Future&quot;, José Clemente Orozco&#x27;s &quot;Catharsis&quot;, and David Alfaro Siqueiros&#x27;s &quot;The Strike&quot;. These murals also encouraged social realism in other Latin American countries, from Ecuador (Oswaldo Guayasamín&#x27;s &quot;The Strike&quot;) to Brazil (Cândido Portinari&#x27;s &quot;Coffee&quot;).

==In Europe==

In Belgium, early representatives of social realism are found in the work of 19th century artists such as Constantin Meunier and Charles de Groux. In Britain, artists such as the American James Abbott McNeill Whistler, as well as English artists Hubert von Herkomer and Luke Fildes had great success with realist paintings dealing with social issues and depictions of the &quot;real&quot; world. Artists in Western Europe also embraced social realism in the early 20th century, including Italian painter and illustrator Bruno Caruso, German artists Käthe Kollwitz, George Grosz, Otto Dix, and Max Beckmann; Swedish artist Torsten Billman; Dutch artists Charley Toorop and Pyke Koch; French artists Maurice de Vlaminck, Roger de La Fresnaye, Jean Fautrier, and Francis Gruber and Belgian artists Eugène Laermans and Constant Permeke.

The political polarization of the period resulted in social realism&#x27;s distinction from socialist realism becoming less obvious in public opinion, and by the mid-20th century abstract art had replaced it as the dominant movement in both Western Europe and the United States.

=== France ===

Realism, a style of painting that depicts the actuality of what the eyes can see, was a very popular art form in France around the mid- to late-19th century. It came about with the introduction of photographya new visual source that created a desire for people to produce things that look &quot;objectively real&quot;. Realism was heavily against romanticism, a genre dominating French literature and artwork in the mid-19th century. Undistorted by personal bias, Realism believed in the ideology of external reality and revolted against exaggerated emotionalism. Truth and accuracy became the goals of many realists as Gustave Courbet.
=== Russia and the Soviet Union ===

The French Realist movement had equivalents in all other Western countries, developing somewhat later. In particular, the Peredvizhniki or &quot;Wanderers&quot; group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as Ilya Repin and had a great influence on Russian art.

From that important trend came the development of socialist realism, which was to dominate Soviet culture and artistic expression for over 60 years. Socialist realism, representing socialist ideologies, was an art movement that represented social and political contemporary life in the 1930s, from a left-wing standpoint. It depicted subjects of social concern; the proletariat strugglehardships of everyday life that the working class had to put up with, and heroically emphasized the values of the loyal communist workers.

The ideology behind social realism, communicated by depicting the heroism of the working class, was to promote and spark revolutionary actions and to spread the image of optimism and the importance of productiveness. Keeping people optimistic meant creating a sense of patriotism, which would prove very important in the struggle to produce a successful socialist nation. The Unions Newspaper, the &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot;, described social realism as &quot;the representation of the proletarian revolution&quot;. During Joseph Stalin&#x27;s reign, it was considered most important to use socialist realism as a form of propaganda in posters, as it kept people optimistic and encouraged greater productive effort, a necessity in his aim of developing Russia into an industrialized nation.
Vladimir Lenin believed that art should belong to the people and should stand on the side of the proletariat. &quot;Art should be based on their feelings, thoughts, and demands, and should grow along with them&quot;, said Lenin. He also believed that literature must be part of the proletariat&#x27;s common cause. After the revolution of 1917, leaders of the newly formed communist party were encouraging experimentation of different art types. Lenin believed that the style of art the USSR should endorse would have to be easy to understand (ruling out abstract art such as suprematism and constructivism) for the masses of illiterate people in Russia.

A wide-ranging debate on art took place; the main disagreement was between those who believed in &quot;Proletarian Art&quot; which should have no connections with past art coming out of bourgeois society, and those (most vociferously Leon Trotsky) who believed that art in a society dominated by working-class values had to absorb all the lessons of bourgeois art before it could move forward at all.

The taking of power by Joseph Stalin&#x27;s faction had its corollary in the establishment of an official art: on 23 April 1932, headed by Stalin, an organization formed by the central committee of the Communist Party developed the Union of Soviet Writers. This organization endorsed the newly designated ideology of social realism.

By 1934, all other independent art groups were abolished, making it nearly impossible for someone not involved in the Union of Soviet Writers to get work published. Any literary piece or painting that did not endorse the ideology of social realism was censored or banned. This new art movement, introduced under Joseph Stalin, was one of the most practical and durable artistic approaches of the 20th century. With the communist revolution came also a cultural revolution. It also gave Stalin and his Communist Party greater control over Soviet culture and restricted people from expressing alternative geopolitical ideologies that differed to those represented in socialist realism. The decline of social realism came with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

== In film ==
Social realism in cinema found its roots in Italian neorealism, especially the films of Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Luchino Visconti and to some extent Federico Fellini.
===In British cinema===
Early British cinema used the common social interaction found in the literary works of Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy. One of the first British films to emphasize realism&#x27;s value as a social protest was James Williamson&#x27;s &quot;A Reservist Before the War, and After the War&quot; in 1902. The film memorialized Boer War serviceman coming back home to unemployment. Repressive censorship during 1945–54 prevented British films from displaying more radical social positions.

After World War I, the British middle-class generally responded to realism and restraint in cinema, while the working-class generally favored Hollywood genre movies. Thus realism carried connotations of education and high seriousness. These social and aesthetic distinctions would soon become running themes as social realism is now associated with the arthouse auteur, while mainstream Hollywood films are shown at the multiplex.

Producer Michael Balcon revived this distinction in the 1940s, referring to the British industry&#x27;s rivalry with Hollywood in terms of &quot;realism and tinsel&quot;. Balcon, the head of Ealing Studios, became a key figure in the emergence of a national cinema characterized by stoicism and verisimilitude. Critic Richard Armstrong said: &quot;Combining the objective temper and aesthetics of the documentary movement with the stars and resources of studio filmmaking, 1940s British cinema made a stirring appeal to a mass audience.&quot;

Social realism in cinema was reflecting Britain&#x27;s transforming wartime society. Women were working alongside men in the military and its munitions factories, challenging pre-assigned gender roles. Rationing, air raids and unprecedented state intervention in the life of the individual encouraged a more social philosophy and worldview. Social realist films of the era include &quot;Target for Tonight&quot; (1941), &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942), &quot;Millions Like Us&quot; (1943), and &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; (1944). Historian Roger Manvell wrote, &quot;As the cinemas [closed initially because of the fear of air raids] reopened, the public flooded in, searching for relief from hard work, companionship, release from tension, emotional indulgence and, where they could find them, some reaffirmation of the values of humanity.&quot;

In the postwar period, films like &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; (1949), &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; (1949), and &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot; (1952) reiterated gentle patrician values, creating a tension between the camaraderie of the war years and the burgeoning consumer society.

Sydney Box&#x27;s arrival as head of Gainsborough pictures in 1946 saw a transition from the Gainsborough melodramas, which had been successful during the war years, to social realism. Issues such as short-term sexual relationships, adultery, and illegitimate births flourished during the Second World War and Box, who favoured realism over what he termed as &quot;flamboyance fantasy&quot;, brought these and other social issues, such as child adoption, juvenile delinquency, and displaced persons to the fore with films such as &quot;When the Bough Breaks&quot; (1947), &quot;Good-Time Girl&quot; (1948), &quot;Portrait from Life&quot; (1948), &quot;The Lost People&quot; (1949), and &quot;Boys in Brown&quot; (1949). Films of new rapidly expanding forms of leisure by working class families in postwar Britain were also represented by Box in &quot;Holiday Camp&quot; (1947), &quot;Easy Money&quot; (1948), and &quot;A Boy, a Girl and a Bike&quot; (1949). Box remained determined on making social realism films, even after Gainsborough closed in 1951, when he said in 1952 &quot;No film has yet been made of the Tolpuddle Martyrs, the Suffragette Movement, the National Health Service as it is today, or the scandals of the patent medicines, oil control in the World, or armaments manufactured for profit.&quot; However, he would not go on to make these types of stories into films, instead focusing on issues related to abortion, teenage prostitution, bigamy, child neglect, shoplifting, and drug trafficking in films such as &quot;Street Corner&quot; (1953), &quot;Too Young to Love&quot; (1959), and &quot;Subway in the Sky&quot; (1959).

A British New Wave movement emerged in the 1950s and 1960s. British auteurs like Karel Reisz, Tony Richardson, and John Schlesinger brought wide shots and plain speaking to stories of ordinary Britons negotiating postwar social structures. Relaxation of censorship enabled film makers to portray issues such as prostitution, abortion, homosexuality, and alienation. Characters included factory workers, office underlings, dissatisfied wives, pregnant girlfriends, runaways, the marginalized, the poor, and the depressed. The New Wave protagonist was usually a working-class male without bearings in a society in which traditional industries and the cultures that went with them were in decline.

Mike Leigh and Ken Loach also make contemporary social realist films.

*&quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; (1960) 
*&quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; (1962)
*&quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; (1962)
===In Indian cinema===
Social realism was also adopted by Hindi films of the 1940s and 1950s, including Chetan Anand&#x27;s &quot;Neecha Nagar&quot; (1946), which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the first Cannes Film Festival, and Bimal Roy&#x27;s &quot;Two Acres of Land&quot; (1953), which won the International Prize at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival. The success of these films gave rise to the Indian New Wave, with early Bengali art films such as Ritwik Ghatak&#x27;s &quot;Nagarik&quot; (1952) and Satyajit Ray&#x27;s &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; (1955–59). Realism in Indian cinema dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, with early examples including V. Shantaram&#x27;s films &quot;Indian Shylock&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Unaccpected&quot; (1937).

<doc id="273466" wikidata="Q5208915" url="?curid=273466" title="Dahlonega Mint">
<text>The Dahlonega Mint was a former branch of the United States Mint built during the Georgia Gold Rush to help the miners get their gold assayed and minted, without having to travel to the Philadelphia Mint. It was located at (34°31.8′N 83°59.2′W ) in Dahlonega, Lumpkin County, Georgia. Coins produced at the Dahlonega Mint bear the &quot;D&quot; mint mark. That mint mark is used today by the Denver Mint, which opened in 1906, over four decades after the Dahlonega Mint closed. All coins from the Dahlonega Mint are gold, in the $1, $2.50, $3, and $5 denominations, and bear dates in the range 1838–1861.

The Mint Act of 1835, established by the United States Congress on 3 March, established &quot;one branch at the city of New Orleans for the coinage of gold and silver; one branch at the town of Charlotte...for the coinage of gold only; and one branch at or near Dahlonega, in Lumpkin County, in the state of Georgia, also for the coinage of gold only.&quot;

Ignatius Alphonso Few, appointed commissioner, bought ten acres south of Dahlonega for $1,050 (equal to $ today) in August 1835, and hired the architect Benjamin Towns, the lowest bidder at $33,450 (equal to $ today), to construct the mint within eighteen months. Mint machinery was installed in 1837, which included &quot;cutting presses, a fly wheel, a drawing frame, a crank shaft, a coining press, and eighteen annealing pans.&quot; The coining press could make &quot;fifty to sixty gold coins per minute.&quot;

Superintendent Dr. Joseph Singleton, opened the mint in February 1838. About a thousand ounces of gold were deposited in the first week, and the first coins consisting of eighty five-dollar gold pieces, were minted on 17 April.

==Production==

The mint produced coins every year from 1838 through 1861. Denominations produced included $1.00; $2.50 (quarter eagles); $3.00 (1854 only); and $5.00 (half eagles).

==The Civil War==
When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, the Dahlonega Mint was seized by the Confederates. It is believed that after the Confederates took over the mint in 1861, that some gold dollars and half eagles were minted under the authority of the Confederate States Government. The exact number of 1861-D gold dollars produced is unknown, while approximately 1,597 1861-D half eagles were struck. Because of their relatively low mintage, all Dahlonega-minted gold coins are rare. It is generally accepted that gold coins estimated to exceed $6 million were minted here.

==Post Civil War==
After the end of the Civil War, The United States Government decided against reopening the mint. The building was unused until the founding of North Georgia College in 1873. The mint building was used as the main academic and administrative building for the college until a fire destroyed the original building in December 1878. A new building for the college was erected on the foundations of the old mint building. This building is now named Price Memorial Hall after William P. Price, the founder of the college, and is still used by the college today.

Gold leaf from this area also covers the exterior of the domed roof over the rotunda of the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta. Local media often refer to the state legislature&#x27;s activities as what&#x27;s going on &quot;under the gold dome&quot;. After the capitol building was gold leafed citizens of Dahlonega began a campaign to gold leaf Price Memorial Hall after the same fashion as the capitol.

<doc id="273467" wikidata="Q613067" url="?curid=273467" title="Namor">
<text>Namor McKenzie (), also known as the Sub-Mariner, is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-artist Bill Everett for comic book packager Funnies Inc., the character first appeared in &quot;Motion Picture Funnies Weekly&quot; #1 (uncirculated). Namor first appeared publicly in &quot;Marvel Comics&quot; #1 (cover-dated October 1939). It was the first comic book from Timely Comics, the 1930s–1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. During that period, known to historians and fans as the Golden Age of Comic Books, the Sub-Mariner was one of Timely&#x27;s top three characters, along with Captain America and the original Human Torch. Moreover, Namor has also been described as the first comic book antihero.

The mutant son of a human sea captain and a princess of the mythical undersea kingdom of Atlantis, Namor possesses the superstrength and aquatic abilities of the &quot;Homo mermanus&quot; race, as well as the mutant ability of flight, along with other superhuman powers. Throughout the years he has been portrayed as an antihero, alternating between a good-natured but short-fused superhero, and a hostile invader seeking vengeance for perceived wrongs that misguided surface-dwellers committed against his kingdom. A historically important and relatively popular Marvel character, Namor has served directly with the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, the Invaders, the Defenders, the X-Men and the Illuminati as well as serving as a foil to them on occasion.

Tenoch Huerta Mejía portrays Namor in his live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot; (2022).

==Publication history==
===Creation===
Namor was created by writer-artist Bill Everett. The character first appeared in April 1939 in the prototype for a planned giveaway comic titled &quot;Motion Picture Funnies Weekly&quot;, which was produced by the comic book packager Funnies Inc. The only eight known samples among those created to send to theater owners were discovered in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. Allegedly, Everett created Namor because he was informed that Carl Burgos had created the Human Torch, who can manipulate fire, and he wanted to play on the notion of &quot;fire and water&quot;. His interest in &quot;anything nautical, [and having] to do with the sea&quot;, also factored in Namor&#x27;s creation and origin.

Everett stated that the inspiration for creating the character was Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s poem &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; (1798), and came up with &quot;Namor&quot; by writing down noble-sounding names backwards and thought Roman / Namor looked the best. He described the character as an &quot;ultra-man of the deep [who] lives on land and in the sea, flies in the air, [and] has the strength of a thousand [surface] men&quot;. When the giveaway idea with &quot;Motion Picture Funnies Weekly&quot; fell through, Everett used the character for &quot;Marvel Comics&quot; #1, the first comic book by Funnies, Inc. client Timely Comics, predecessor of Marvel Comics. The final panel of the earlier, unpublished eight-page Sub-Mariner story had included a &quot;Continued Next Week&quot; box that reappeared, sans lettering, in an expanded 12-page story.

===Golden Age===

In his first appearances Namor was an enemy of the United States. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that &quot;Namor was a freak in the service of chaos. Although the Sub-Mariner acted like a villain, his cause had some justice, and readers reveled in his assaults on civilization. His enthusiastic fans weren&#x27;t offended by the carnage he created as he wrecked everything from ships to skyscrapers.&quot; Everett&#x27;s antihero would eventually battle Carl Burgos&#x27; android superhero, the Human Torch, when in 1940 Namor threatened to sink the island of Manhattan underneath a tidal wave. When the U.S. entered World War II, Namor would aid the Allies of World War II against Adolf Hitler and the Axis powers. Supporting characters included Betty Dean, a New York City policewoman introduced in &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; #3 (and later known as Betty Dean-Prentiss), who was a steady companion, and his cousins Namora and Dorma.

Namor starred in the Golden Age comic book &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot;, published quarterly, then thrice-yearly, and finally bimonthly, from issues #1–32 (Fall 1941–June 1949). A backup feature each issue starred the detective-superhero the Angel. Along with many other Timely characters, Namor disappeared a few years after the end of World War II and the decline in popularity of superhero comics. He briefly fought crime as a member of the post-war superhero team the All-Winners Squad, and, through a 1970s retcon, was given a history of having fought with the Allies during World War II in the superhero team the Invaders. Both of these super-groups were built around the core of Namor, Captain America, and the original Human Torch. The Sub-Mariner experienced a brief revival in the mid-1950s at Atlas Comics, the 1950s iteration of Marvel. Along with Captain America and the original Human Torch, he was revived in &quot;Young Men&quot; #24. Soon afterward, &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; was revived with issues #33–42 (April 1954 – Oct. 1955). During this time, Namora had her own spin-off series. A planned live-action television program starring Namor did not appear and the revival of the comic book series was cancelled a second time.

===Silver Age===
Namor returned in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #4 (May 1962), where a member of the titular superhero team, Johnny Storm, the new Human Torch, discovers him living as an amnesiac homeless man in the Bowery section of Manhattan. Storm helps him recover his memory, and Namor immediately returns to his undersea kingdom—later identified as Atlantis in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; Annual #1 (June 1963). Finding it destroyed from nuclear testing, Namor assumes his people are scattered and that he will never find them. He again becomes an antihero during this period, as two elements – a thirst for vengeance and a quest for identity – would dominate the Sub-Mariner stories of the 1960s. He was both a villain and a hero – striking against the human race who destroyed his home, but showing a great deal of &quot;noblesse oblige&quot; to individuals.

Initially, Namor variously finds himself allied with the supervillains Doctor Doom and Magneto, but his royal nobility and stubborn independent streak make these alliances-of-convenience short-lived. Namor&#x27;s revival was a hit with readers, but Marvel could not give him his own title due to publication and distribution restrictions that would not be lifted until 1968. Instead, Namor was given numerous guest-appearances – including in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #7 (April 1965), a rare superhero story drawn by comics great Wally Wood – and a starring feature in the split-title comic &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; (beginning issue #70, Aug. 1965). By now, during a period fans and historians call the Silver Age of Comic Books, he is more authoritative, arrogant and solemn than the impetuous youthful character of the 1940s and mid-1950s, speaking in neo-Shakespearean dialogue rather than the more colloquial speech of his youth, often shouting his battle cry, &quot;Imperius Rex!&quot;.

===Bronze Age===
He was spun off into his own title, the 1968–74 series &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot;. The super-villain Tiger Shark was introduced in issue #5 by writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema and the super-hero Stingray in issue #19 by Thomas and Bill Everett. Some of the later issues of this &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; series are notable for having been written and drawn by the character&#x27;s creator, Bill Everett, shortly before his death; as well, they reintroduced a now-older Namora, and introduced her daughter, Namorita Prentiss. By now more of a reluctant superhero &quot;the Sub-Mariner was perfect for the Marvel Age of angst-ridden protagonists. Noble yet misunderstood, powerful yet thwarted ... [he was] portrayed as a regal monarch – a king without a country.&quot; The final issue, #72 (Sept. 1974), was written by Steve Skeates and featured an unofficial intercompany crossover with the last issue of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Aquaman&quot; series. A five- to six-page backup feature, &quot;Tales of Atlantis&quot;, chronicling the undersea kingdom from its ancient origins, appeared in issues #62–66 (June–Oct. 1973), written by Steve Gerber, with penciling by Howard Chaykin and later Jim Mooney. After the cancellation of &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot;, Namor co-starred with Doctor Doom in the &quot;Super-Villain Team-Up&quot; series. The series suffered from mediocre sales due to its lack of a stable creative team, and following issue #13 Namor was dropped from the co-star spot. Marvel published a four-issue miniseries a decade later, &quot;Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner&quot; (Sept.-Dec. 1984), by scripter/co-plotter J. M. DeMatteis, penciler/co-plotter Bob Budiansky, and inker Danny Bulanadi.

===Modern Age===
The 12-issue maxiseries &quot;The Saga of the Sub-Mariner&quot; (Nov. 1988 – Oct. 1989) provided a retrospective of Namor&#x27;s past adventures while tying up loose plot threads and resolving contradictions that had accumulated over the character&#x27;s decades of published history. Namor again received an ongoing series in 1990. &quot;Namor, the Sub-Mariner&quot;, which ran 62 issues (April 1990 – May 1995), was initially written and penciled by John Byrne who took over the inking as well from issues #4–21. Unlike all of Namor&#x27;s previous series, the cover logo emphasized the character&#x27;s name rather than the &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; epithet. From #26–38, the series&#x27; penciler and eventual penciler-inker was then-newcomer Jae Lee, with Bob Harras scripting from #33–40. After three fill-in issues, the remainder of the series was written by Glenn Herdling and pencilled by Geof Isherwood. This series followed Namor as CEO of Oracle, Inc., a corporation devoted to reducing pollution, particularly in the oceans, and provided the stage for the return of the 1970s martial artist superhero Iron Fist, who had been presumed dead. Whereas J. M. DeMatteis saw his series as an opportunity to explore Namor much more deeply than he had been able to in the team book &quot;The Defenders&quot;, John Byrne felt that the character did not work well outside of a group context and accordingly gave &quot;Namor, the Sub-Mariner&quot; a massive supporting cast.

The 12-issue miniseries &quot;Namor&quot; (June 2003–May 2004), credited to co-writers Bill Jemas (then Marvel&#x27;s president) and Andi Watson, and penciled initially by Salvador Larroca and later by Pat Olliffe and others, explored Namor&#x27;s youth, charting his teenage romance with a young American girl in the early 20th century. A six-issue miniseries, &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; vol. 2 (Aug. 2007 – Jan. 2008), by co-writers Matt Cherniss and Peter Johnson and, primarily, artist Phil Briones, introduced Namor&#x27;s heretofore undisclosed son, Kamar. Namor was featured in his own ongoing series, &quot;Namor: The First Mutant&quot;, in 2011. The series was cancelled after less than a year into its publication. Namor has also served alongside, or even as a member of, superhero teams – most notably the Defenders, which included Doctor Strange, the Hulk, and the Silver Surfer. Other groups he was associated with included the Avengers; and both the World War II and modern-day versions of the Invaders. Marvel revived &quot;The Defenders&quot;, with Namor on the team, in December 2011. The series was cancelled after 12 issues. He became one of the main characters, along with the other Illuminati members, in the third volume of &quot;New Avengers&quot; beginning in 2013. He appeared in the 2018 &quot;Namor: The Best Defense&quot; one-shot.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Namor was born in the capital city of the Atlantean empire, then located under the Antarctic ice pack. His mother was Emperor Thakorr&#x27;s daughter, Fen, and his father an American sea captain, Leonard McKenzie, of the icebreaker &quot;Oracle&quot;; they had fallen in love and married aboard ship while she was, unbeknownst to him, spying on the human intruders. When Fen did not return, Atlantean warriors attacked the &quot;Oracle&quot;, evidently killing Captain McKenzie, and returned Fen to her kingdom. The pink-skinned mutant Namor was subsequently born among the blue-skinned Atlanteans. He became the Prince of Atlantis, and a warrior for his people against the &quot;surface-dwellers&quot;.

At some point, when Namor was a child, the people of Atlantis relocated and built a new kingdom near the Pacific Northwest. There, Namor would befriend a young girl named Sandy Pierce, the daughter of wealthy businessman Henry Pierce. During this time, Namor would also meet his cousin Namora, who was named after him. Years later as a teenager, Namor would reconnect with Sandy, revealing his identity to her and starting a relationship. Due to oil leaking from the ground into Atlantis, and Sandy&#x27;s father facing financial ruin due to problems with his oil rig, Namor struck a deal with Henry to help each other out. In an attempt to discredit Namor in the eyes of the Atlanteans, his cousin Beemer first attacked Sandy and her father and destroyed the oil rig. With the oil threatening to poison them, the Atlanteans had to relocate back to the South Pacific Ocean. Sandy decided to join them, but would disappear. When Namor was a teenager, he witnessed the Chasm People&#x27;s Swift Tide in combat practice until his royal cousin Lady Dorma arrived. He even witnesses a meeting between Atlantis and the Chasm People where he has his first encounter with Prince Attuma. When some Chasm People appear to take on the Imperial Atlanteans and the traitorous Swift Tide, Namor and Lady Dorma are awestruck of the Swift Tide&#x27;s fighting skills as they and Attuma assist in the battle. When it came to a dark artifact called the Unforgotten Stone, the Swift Tide is sent to retrieve it.

===World War II===
In 1939, Namor became friends with New York City policewoman Betty Dean, who pleaded with him to help the Allies&#x27; effort against the Axis powers during World War II. Despite originally denying her pleas, and attacking New York on multiple occasions due to their provocations, Namor decided to join the Allies&#x27; cause against the Nazis in September 1940. After the attack on Pearl Harbor and the US officially joining the war in 1941, Namor formed superhero team the Invaders, alongside Captain America, Bucky, the original Human Torch, and Toro. In 1944, Namor and the Invaders would go to Wakanda, where they encountered T&#x27;Chaka, the king and Black Panther of the nation. Namor would later find both contention and companionship in youthful monarch T&#x27;Challa. The pair of kings would briefly work together to track down traitors and enemies along with missing subjects of their respective kingdoms for a time. Succeeding in their mission, Namor and T&#x27;Challa would part on friendly terms afterwards, the former being dismayed after hearing of his land-born counterpart&#x27;s opening suzerainties to the rest of the world later on.

While investigating an assault on Atlantis, Namor fell under the control of Paul Destine, bearer of the Serpent Crown, who bade him to fly to New York and wander without his memories until he was summoned. In his amnesiac state, he met the daughter of friend and fellow World War II veteran Randall Peterson, Nay Peterson, who recognized him and took him back to her family home. Namor spent years living with the Petersons, slowly recovering his memories, until he was approached by Professor Charles Xavier and joined him in search of fellow mutants. His travels with Xavier revealed Namor&#x27;s emotional imbalance due to wartime PTSD. In an attempt to heal Namor&#x27;s mental trauma, Xavier created a persona based on his memories of Thomas Machan, another war buddy Namor had failed to save, hoping that Machan could act as therapist for him. When confronted with the presence of his dead friend, Namor instead suffered a mental break and fled, succumbing to Destine&#x27;s command once more. Xavier&#x27;s intervention would solidify the bipolar disorder he would suffer from for decades to come.

===The Fantastic Four and modern world===
He was later found by Johnny Storm in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #4 living in the flophouse Bowery district of Manhattan as an amnesiac derelict. Regaining his memory, he became enraged upon learning that his people&#x27;s city had been destroyed by nuclear testing, its inhabitants evacuated. Namor vows revenge on humanity, but after several attacks thwarted by superheroes, including in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #6, 9, and 14 (Sept. and Dec. 1962, May 1963), &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #107 (April 1963), he finds his people and launches an unsuccessful invasion of New York City in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; Annual #1 (1963).
Namor&#x27;s experience with the Fantastic Four leads to a long-running romantic triangle for Namor, Sue Storm, and Reed Richards. Namor becomes obsessed with Sue, who finds him dangerously attractive.

Prior to Namor&#x27;s first battle with the Avengers, he comes across a group of Inuit worshiping a figure frozen in ice; someone whom the Sub-Mariner vaguely recognizes from the past just before hurling said monolith into the ocean during an outburst of rage. After his second bout with the Avengers he is approached by then-ally in the war turned adversary in modern times; Captain Steven Rogers, the two catching up about life and times. Namor returns to Atlantis to marry his royal cousin Lady Dorma. In &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; #37 (May 1971), the evil princess Llyra of Lemuria, another undersea culture, kidnaps and replaces Dorma at the wedding, hoping to usurp Namor&#x27;s kingdom. Though Namor&#x27;s marriage to Dorma is still official, she dies as a result of Llyra&#x27;s machinations. In issues #45–46 (Nov.-Dec. 1971) Namor finally meets his father, long thought dead, only to lose him when Leonard McKenzie gives his life in battle against the supervillain Tiger Shark. Namor allies with the &quot;non-team&quot; the Defenders initially in &quot;Marvel Feature&quot; #1–3, Dec. 1971 – June 1972, then in the series &quot;The Defenders&quot;. After being deposed from his throne, Namor joins the superhero team the Avengers. He is briefly married to Marrina, an aquatic alien and a member of the Canadian super-team Alpha Flight. She is later presumed killed, but she is later revealed to be in a coma, of which Namor is unaware.

Father-daughter oceanographers Caleb and Carrie Alexander, theorizing that Namor&#x27;s propensity toward rage is due to his half-human half-Atlantean blood chemistry, equip Namor with a monitor to warn when he has to seek either air or water. This allows Namor to control his metabolism. He collects sunken treasures to finance his secret purchase of a corporation he renames Oracle Inc., which he turns to conservation and environmental purposes. Unbeknownst to the Sub-Mariner, the Machan guilt apparition would secretly influence his actions, leading him to turn willing Atlantean soldiers human for the purpose of infiltrating governments. Later, Namor loses his ankle-wings during a battle with the animated garbage-monster Sluj, but they are later restored. Namor travels to the dimension of K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un, where he finds and retrieves the superhero Iron Fist, who had been presumed dead. Namor reclaims the throne of Atlantis, and Oracle begins sponsoring the charitable super-group Heroes for Hire. In the one-shot &quot;New Avengers: Illuminati&quot; (May 2006), Namor is revealed to have been a member for several years of the clandestine policy group the Illuminati, with Mister Fantastic, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Professor X, and Black Bolt. In the series &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; vol. 2 #1–6 (Aug. 2007–Jan. 2008), he discovers his long-lost son Kamar, who attempts to usurp the throne of Atlantis but is killed by the supervillain Nitro.

In 2011, Namor joined the mutant superhero team the X-Men. Namor helped with the Curse of the Mutants, and Avengers vs. X-Men events before joining the Illuminati and All-New Invaders. That same year, during the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Namor is ousted from his kingdom by Attuma, who was transformed into Nerkodd: Breaker of Oceans. Namor assists the X-Men, who have relocated to Utopia, off the coast of San Francisco, and sides with them during the subsequent war with the Avengers over the coming of the Phoenix Force to Earth. He becomes one of the Phoenix Five when the Phoenix Force is fractured between himself, Cyclops, Emma Frost, Colossus and Magik. He eventually becomes the first of the Phoenix Five to fall. Namor rejoins the Illuminati, but believing the group&#x27;s morality holds it back, he assembles a new group, the Cabal, to deal with interdimensional incursions. Namor and the Cabal eventually escape to another Earth, this one in the Ultimate Universe. The new Squadron Supreme decapitates Namor in retaliation for the worlds destroyed by the Cabal, but this is undone through time travel.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Captain America puts Namor into a position where he is forced to sign a peace treaty that for a time enabled Hydra to access a fragment of the Cosmic Cube stored in Atlantis. In reality, Namor secretly aids the Underground resistances against Hydra, after finding Winter Soldier falling to the sea out of nowhere and cover his track from Hydra by disguising him as his bodyguard, having had realized that the Steve Rogers-Captain America he and his fellow resistances saw now is not the man they once knew. Once Captain America returns and gives hope to his fellow heroes to find the Cosmic Cube fragments before Hydra does, Namor tells Winter Soldier that the time has come to remove the latter&#x27;s disguise and help their fellow allies against Hydra, and returning the real Steve Rogers they knew.

===Marvel Legacy &amp; Fresh Start (2017–present)===
====&quot;X-Men Red&quot; and &quot;West Coast Avengers&quot;====
Sometime after the fall of Hydra America, Jean Grey of the X-Men implores Namor&#x27;s backing for a new mutant nation. He lends the support of Atlantis to her cause and works with his fellow mutants in the battle against Cassandra Nova as she manipulates national powers against &quot;Homo superior&quot; on a global scale, once more donning the colors of X to resist a nanorobotic sentinel attack. Relapsing into his human-hating ways, Namor goes back to concocting war plans against the surface nations of the world. When Professor Charles Xavier offers Namor sanctuary in the new mutant nation of Krakoa, the somber monarch refuses Xavier&#x27;s request on the grounds that neither Xavier nor the mutant nation actually believed themselves to be superior to those from whom they had finally separated themselves, and demands that Xavier not contact him until Xavier believes in his own supremacy. Elsewhere, in Los Angeles, while explaining her backstory to Gwen Poole, Ramone Watts implies that both she and her brother Johnny &quot;Fuse&quot; Watts are children of Namor, born to exiled Dora Milaje Zobae.

====Forming the Defenders of the Deep====
Namor crashes Tiger Shark&#x27;s battle with Stingray, nearly killing Stingray and intimidating Tiger Shark into swearing his allegiance. Tiger Shark is drafted into the Defenders of the Deep, along with Orka, Andromeda, Echidna, the Piranhas, Fathom Five members Bloodtide and Manowar, and King Crab, in order to protect the oceans just as the Avengers protect the land. They encounter the Avengers, where Captain America voices his disappointment in Namor for nearly killing Stingray. Their fight is interrupted by the Winter Guard who are also after the Defenders of the Deep. In the ensuing chaos, the Defenders escape after the sea king makes an example of some piranha men. After battling cybernetically augmented dolphins sent by the Roxxon oil corporation, Namor sits brooding in an undersea tavern, musing on the decline of his kingdom and repeated aggression from the surface world, and considering giving in to the hunger for war. The bartender suggests he focus his strength against the Wakandan-led Avengers, pointing out the many potential allies among the Avengers&#x27; enemies. Unbeknownst to Namor, the bartender is an agent of Mephisto. Taking the bartender&#x27;s words to heart, Namor uses his lingering psychic link with the Phoenix Force to summon it back to Earth, promising to set galaxies ablaze in exchange for the power to defeat the Avengers.

====&quot;The Best Defense&quot;====
Leaving the Defenders of the Deep to protect Hydropolis, the Sub-Mariner seeks out a long defected splinter sect of Atlanteans known as the Vodani. Namor attempts to forge an alliance by joining with the king&#x27;s daughter, Kataw, to vanquish an ancient monster, but this turns out to be a ruse by the Vodani king Okun to leave him vulnerable, the Vodani having grown to despise what they see as impure Atlanteans. Namor flings himself at Okun, hoping to surface and use his airbreathing abilities to gain the upper hand, but realizes that the tunnel he passed through to reach the Vodani was in fact a portal to another world, and he has unwittingly cast them both into the vacuum of space, where he is only saved by the unexpected intervention of the Silver Surfer. Namor, in conjunction with his colleagues in the Defenders, battles against Nebulon, a demon-empowered entity who has hijacked a cosmic train that burns planets as fuel, and has directed it to Vodan and ultimately towards Earth. Dr. Strange and Hulk manage to rescue Vodan from the furnace, instead sending it into the freezing void of space. Namor offers to let Kataw use her electricity redirection powers to siphon his bioelectric life force and give the Silver Surfer enough power to save the planet, a sacrifice he is willing to make as king. Furious at his arrogance after killing her father, she sacrifices her own life instead. After being exiled from their world, Namor acknowledges to the Silver Surfer that his offer was an attempt to undermine Kataw&#x27;s rule and force an alliance, but his arrogance has cost yet another life.

====&quot;Invaders&quot;====
Namor prepares for war accompanied by his advisor Machan, who appears to be a blue-skinned Atlantean with the same abilities of flight and air-breathing that Namor does. It soon becomes clear that Machan only exists in Namor&#x27;s mind, and is in fact the psychic entity based on Thomas Machan that Xavier implanted in his mind years before. Namor developed hydrokinesis in order to get a branch of the Atlanteans called the Sea Blades to swear their allegiance with him. In addition to incarcerating the criminal Hydro-Man to siphon his hydrokinetic powers which explained how Namor got the Sea Blades to side with him, Atlantean technicians have been fabricating a bomb to target human DNA. When Captain America tries to broker peace, he is violently beaten by Namor and told that next time there will be no mercy.

Steve and Jim Hammond turn to the Petersons, a bedridden Randall and his daughter Nay, in order to find insight into Namor&#x27;s fits of aggression. Machan urges Namor to dispatch the Petersons to tie up loose ends, and in a confrontation between the three heroes, Randall dies of geriatric complications, much to Namor&#x27;s distress. Nay and her son, US Navy Commander Roman Peterson, are revealed to be agents of Namor. Namor intercepts Hammond and summarily decapitates the android. Roman takes control of a missile base to launch a strike against Atlantis, which the Avengers intercept in order to prevent a war.

The missile strike gives Namor justification to retaliate with the Genus Compound, a biochemical weapon which transforms &quot;homo sapiens&quot; into water breathing &quot;homo mermanus&quot;. He then floods the town in order to save thousands of lives, including Roman, who joins Namor&#x27;s side. The Atlanteans provide humanitarian aid for the displaced townsfolk, Namor&#x27;s intent being to ultimately transform the entire population of Earth into &quot;homo mermanus&quot;. During his time travelling with Professor X, Namor had witnessed the police gun down a mutant called Genus who had the ability to transform animals from one species to another, and has used Genus&#x27; recovered corpse as the basis for his weapon.

The Machan part of Namor&#x27;s psyche continues to work behind Namor&#x27;s back, approving additional testing on Russian citizens without his knowledge. He also procures the Serpent Crown under the pretext of protecting Namor from psychic attack. Namor reveals to Bucky that he is aware that Machan has been intermittently been taking over his body throughout the years, creating the plan without his knowledge, but with his ultimate approval. Machan has become a symbol of his failure and righteous anger at the injustices of the world, pushing him to ever more extreme actions. Machan ultimately uses the Serpent Crown to transfer himself into the body of Roman Peterson, in order to do what his king will not.

When Roxxon mercenaries steal the Genus Compound, Namor is exposed to a variant used to turn Atlantean spies into humans, and loses his powers. He ends up stranded on a seemingly deserted island along with Captain America. Powerless, Namor takes responsibility for everything Machan has done, whereas Steve insists on Namor&#x27;s fundamental goodness. They discover the island hosts a Roxxon testing facility where scientists are experimenting with the Genus Compound to create more humanoid-animal hybrids. Steve uses the compound to restore Namor&#x27;s Atlantean powers, and an enraged Namor releases the experiments upon the scientists, who are mauled to death before Steve can intervene. Steve calls Namor no better than the scientists, as the Genus Compound was his work to begin with.

Steve and Namor reunite with the rest of the Invaders to prevent Roman Machan, as he is now calling himself, from unleashing the Omega Sea. By siphoning water from the oceanic world of Vodon, Machan can flood the planet and coerce humanity into taking the Genus Compound to survive. Namor momentarily falls under the sway of the Serpent Crown but reasserts control, declaring he takes commands from no one. After the Invaders disable the doomsday engine, Namor intends to take Roman Machan back to Atlantis to be executed, but Steve insists that he be taken into surface-dwelling custody as the world still thinks Namor was behind everything. Recounting how a king sacrifices for the sake of the greater good, Rogers challenges his fellow Invader to forgo his vengeful needs for the sake of his kingdom.

====&quot;Atlantis Attacks&quot;====
Namor invades the portal city of Pan to demand the return of Atlantis&#x27; sacred guardian dragon, which the Big Nguyen Company has stolen in order to power the city&#x27;s portal technology. The New Agents of Atlas negotiate a truce between Namor and Pan, with Namor being particularly impressed by Wave due to her recent role in defeating the Sirenas, longtime enemies of Atlantis. The Agents successfully develop a new power source to prevent Pan&#x27;s citizens from being displaced, and the dragon is safely returned to Atlantis, but abruptly goes berserk upon arrival and attacks the underwater city.

Atlantean scientists discover an implant embedded in the dragon&#x27;s scales. Namor flies to Pan for revenge, but Big Nguyen Company&#x27;s CEO and Pan founder Mike Nguyen reveals that he has recruited the Sirenas to defend Pan from attack. Namor defeats a Hulked-out Brawn and is about to strike the final blow, but is overpowered by the Sirenas and imprisoned. Nguyen proposes all-out war with Atlantis, while Namora discovers that the implant on the dragon was Sirena tech, splitting the heroes&#x27; loyalties. Namor breaks free from his restraints and threatens to destroy the entire city upon realizing that Ngyuen has sent a force of Sirenas to attack Atlantis. Nguyen, via hologram, warns of civilian casualties and instead proposes a triple alliance between Pan, Atlantis and the Sirenas; Namor refuses and resumes battle with the remaining Agents.

Brawn talks down the combatants, having hacked Ngyuen&#x27;s mainframe, and confronts Atlas founder Jimmy Woo for withholding secrets from the team. Woo reveals that for thousands of years, dragons have served as advisors for human rulers, using humans as proxies in their conflicts with one another, making them responsible for almost every major war in history. The Atlas Foundation itself is run by a dragon, Mr. Lao. Nguyen intends to unite the world under Pan, proposing to Namor and Woo that by harvesting the combined power of their dragons, they can claim the rest of them. Namor instead returns to Atlantis where Wave brokers a truce with the Sirenas, while Brawn and the other Agents confront Nguyen in his personal bunker. Nguyen attaches a Sirena implant to Amadeus, transforming him into the Hulk.

Nguyen commands the Hulk to kill Namor to ensure Pan&#x27;s safety, intending to wipe out all kings and autocrats. Namor takes the battle to an island two miles off the Heart of Pan, where Sword Master and Shang-Chi manage to remove the device, freeing Amadeus from Nguyen&#x27;s control. Namor then reveals that the shockwaves from the Hulk&#x27;s blows have created a massive tsunami that is heading towards the Heart of Pan. With some goading from Woo and Namor, Brawn transforms back into Hulk and creates another shockwave to weaken the tsunami with help from Namor, Wave, Aero and Luna Snow. The city is saved, although Nguyen dies protecting a Madripoorian refugee and her young son from the tsunami. One month later at the Heart of Pan, Woo announces to the Agents and Pan&#x27;s new leadership at a banquet that Atlantis and the Sirenas have signed a non-aggression pact, recognizing Pan as an independent nation. Mr. Lao and Woo plan their next move with the Agents: helping Namor fight the King in Black.

====&quot;King in Black&quot;====
During the &quot;King in Black&quot; storyline, Namor recounts his history with the Swift Tide and the exile of the Chasm People. When Knull attacks Earth, Namor agrees to help his fellow superheroes. One way to fight Knull&#x27;s symbiote forces is to awaken the Black Tide. Upon Namor&#x27;s arrival, Iron Man agrees to help him if the Black Tide attack Namor.

====&quot;Enter the Phoenix&quot;====
After the Phoenix Force makes its nest near Avengers Mountain in the North Pole, Namor attempts to reunite with the entity, leading to a clash between the Avengers and the Defenders of the Deep. During the battle, the Phoenix decides to hold a tournament to decide who its next host will be and selects Namor as a candidate, transporting him and many other heroes and villains to another dimension to wait the next match following Captain America&#x27;s win over Doctor Doom.

==Powers and abilities==
Because of his unusual genetic heritage, Namor is unique among both ordinary humans and Atlanteans; he is sometimes referred to as &quot;Marvel&#x27;s first mutant&quot; because, while the majority of his observed superhuman powers come from the fact that he is a hybrid of human and Atlantean DNA, his ability to fly cannot be explained by either side (Atlanteans are an offshoot of &quot;baseline&quot; humanity); however, in terms of in-continuity chronology, there were many mutants in existence before Namor. Namor possesses a fully amphibious physiology suited for extreme undersea pressures, superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, flight, and longevity. Namor has the ability to survive underwater for indefinite periods, and specially developed vision which gives him the ability to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean.

Bill Everett, in his first Sub-Mariner story, described the character as &quot;an ultra-man of the deep [who] lives on land and in the sea, flies in the air, [and] has the strength of a thousand [surface] men&quot;. No other powers were mentioned. When the series was revived in 1954, Namor lost his ankle wings and with them the power of flight; they, and his full strength, were restored in &quot;Sub-Mariner Comics&quot; #38 (Feb. 1955), in which Everett additionally wrote a flashback story, &quot;Wings on His Feet&quot;, detailing their appearance on Namor at age 14. This story was twice reprinted during the Silver Age of Comic Books, in &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot; #17 (Nov. 1968), and in the book &quot;Comix&quot; by Les Daniels.

Namor has the ability to swim at superhuman speeds, even by Atlantean standards.

Namor has greater longevity than a normal human being. He is nearly 100 years old, but has the appearance of a male in his prime.

His enhanced senses enable him to see in the deepest ocean depths, hear when a school of fish turn a corner from a world away and even feel when the deepest currents change by the slightest degree.

In all his incarnations, Namor possesses superhuman strength and, with the possible exceptions of Orka and Tyrak at their full sizes, is the strongest Atlantean ever known. The exact level of his strength is dependent upon his physical contact with water, in which he needn&#x27;t be submerged. It has been shown as sufficient to effortlessly toss a water-filled ocean-liner, despite the underwater viscosity. His strength diminishes slowly the longer he is out of contact with water, though an extended period on land does not result in his death, as it would for a typical Atlantean, and his power is retained in full as long as he keeps himself wet. Namor possesses superhuman stamina and resistance to injury due to his hybrid nature. Namor&#x27;s strength level is such that he has held his own in hand-to-hand combat with beings as powerful as the Hulk in the past.

Some stories have mentioned that Namor has gills for breathing underwater, e.g., in &quot;Namor, the Sub-Mariner&quot; #5, Namor thinks &quot;this New York river water burns my gills and scalds my lungs&quot;. and artists such as Salvador Larroca have drawn him with gill slits on either side of his neck. In &quot;The Sub-Mariner&quot; #18–22 (1969–70), beings from outer space surgically closed Namor&#x27;s gills for a time, leaving him with the ability to breathe air but unable to breathe underwater. Other sources have stated that his lungs contain oxygen diffusing membranes that allow him to breathe underwater.

Namor possesses a telepathic rapport with all forms of marine life. He is able to mentally communicate with most forms of Ichthyoid, Cephalopod, Plankton, Anthozoa, Csnidarian, etc.; and can mentally persuade them to do his bidding. Namor can mentally communicate with other Atlanteans and give mental-telepathic orders to all his men. He had a limited empathic rapport with Namorita, but only as a result of being given one of her &quot;magic earrings&quot; (which has long since disappeared).

Due to a unique aspect of his hybrid nature, not shared by Namorita, it was theorized that Namor is vulnerable to oxygen imbalances in his blood that trigger manic-depressive mood swings; he can prevent imbalances by regular immersion in water.

Namor was educated by the royal tutors of the Atlantean court, and speaks many surface languages, Atlantean, and Lemurian. He is a highly skilled business executive. On top of having a slew of vast Atlantean technologies available to him and his forces, Namor also has a slew of powerful mystical relics in his national treasury he regularly makes use of; like the Trident of Neptune, patron weapon of his kingdom&#x27;s founding sea god Poseidon.

The weapon supposedly comes with many replicas as an adversary who held the sea king in resentment due to prior infractions he had in the past utilized a true oceanic scepter while Namor held only a ceremonial copy. Said recipient would study up on the lore of Atlantis&#x27;s mythical, mystical background and discovered a hidden treasure cove pertaining to numerous magical relics in the ocean deity&#x27;s possession. One that would enable he and all others who wielded it power over the waters of the world and the vast metaphysical might of its namesake to which they could accomplish a great many feats. Other powers include that of physical transformation, such as changing a human into merfolk, firing destructive energy beams, commanding the creatures of the brine to act on its wielders behalf, as well as influence both weather and the tides of the world to do their bidding. Like all weapons and reliquary crafted by and for the Olympian Pantheon, such as Heracles&#x27; Adamantine Mace, the trident is composed of indestructible metal belonging to the gods, able to battle against multiple enforcers of the Thor Corps and their legions of Mjolnir hammers without taking any damage.

Through unknown means, Namor later siphoned the hydrokinesis abilities of Hydro-Man. He was able to flood a prison cell containing Roxxon murderers miles away from the ocean using the penal facility&#x27;s sewage line. When he went to conscript the Sea Blades in preparation for war on the surface world, he literally parted the seas around them only to drop the waters back into place.

In the past Namor has interacted with the Serpent Crown throughout his adventures, in later publishing he has regained access to all of its supernatural facilities to augment his own powers.

===Former powers and abilities===
In &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #9 (Dec. 1962), Namor states, &quot;I have the powers of all the creatures who live beneath the sea! I can charge the very air with electricity – using the power of the electric eel!&quot; In the same issue, &quot;the radar sense of the cave fish from the lowest depths of the sea&quot; enables him to sense the presence of Sue Storm when she is invisible. He uses &quot;the power to surround himself with electricity in the manner of an electric eel&quot; again in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #107 (April 1963), and #125 (Oct. 1964); in the former, he manifests the power to inflate his body like a puffer fish. An editorial note in &quot;Marvel Tales&quot; #9 (July 1967), which reprinted the story from &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #107, stated explicitly that &quot;nautical Namor has since lost his power to imitate the characteristics of fish...&quot; His electrical abilities were seen in later comics, and in the 1991 &quot;Spider-Man: The Video Game&quot;.

In &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; #2 (Dec. 1939) Namor once boasted a personal hydration function of his physiology, once extinguishing a pedestrian had been set on fire by cigarette light. His body excreted water from his individual pores, dousing the flames. During Namor&#x27;s original fight with the Human Torch in &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; #8 (June 1940, and the first fight between superheroes at Marvel), Namor was able to forcibly expel water from his body to extinguish fires, although it proved useless against the Torch.
Namor was given possession of the Time Gem which he did not use. This gem allows the user total control over the past, present, and future. It allows time travel, can age and de-age beings, and can be used as a weapon by trapping enemies or entire worlds in unending loops of time. After the Hood attempted to steal the Gems, Namor briefly helped Thor recover the Gem from the bottom of the ocean to prevent the Hood acquiring it, before being entrusted with the Power Gem as the Gems were divided amongst the new Illuminati – Steve Rogers replacing Black Bolt – once again.

Namor was host for a fifth of the Phoenix Force as one of the Phoenix Five. He lost the Phoenix Force in battle with the Scarlet Witch. He summoned the Phoenix Force to regain those powers, but the Phoenix decided to choose its next host in a tournament. Each candidate, including Namor, was temporarily given a portion of the Phoenix Force, until Echo was chosen as its new host.

==&quot;Marvel&#x27;s first mutant&quot;==
Marvel has repeatedly identified Namor as &quot;Marvel&#x27;s first mutant,&quot; which is accurate when describing first appearances in print. However, he is not the oldest mutant within the fictional Marvel Universe timeline. A number of mutants predate him, including Selene, Apocalypse, Romulus, Exodus, Sabertooth, Azazel, Wolverine, Mystique, and Destiny.

In &quot;X-Men&quot; #6 (July 1964), X-Men leader Professor Xavier and antagonist Magneto each suspect Namor is a mutant and make efforts to recruit him. Later writers in the 1960s and 1970s described him as a hybrid, not a mutant, to distinguish him from the mutant X-Men. When the series was revived in 1990, the series title logo carried the subtitle &quot;Marvel&#x27;s first and mightiest mutant!&quot;

Namor is actually a hybrid of Atlantean and human physiology, although he has principal characteristics that neither Atlanteans (&quot;Homo mermanus&quot;) nor humans (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) possess. These include his ability to fly, and possibly his durability and strength (which is several times that of an Atlantean).

In the first issue of the five-part &quot;Illuminati&quot; miniseries, after being experimented on by the Skrulls, it was confirmed that Namor is not only an Atlantean/human hybrid but also a mutant.

==Enemies==
* Attuma – Leader of the Atlantean barbarians, Attuma would threaten Atlantis repeatedly; conquering it on several occasions, and became Namor&#x27;s nemesis.
* Byrrah – Childhood friend and rival to Namor, Byrrah was Atlantean royalty that lost the throne to Namor and observed him as unfit for the position. For many years, he would challenge Namor&#x27;s rule and ally with his enemies to usurp him. Eventually, he appears to have made peace with Namor and stands by his side as a brother.
* Captain Barracuda – A modern-day pirate employing advanced technology that frequently crossed swords with Namor (and several other heroes).
* Deep Six – A group formed by Attuma to maintain his rule of Atlantis during one of his periods as its conqueror. His subordinates included Tiger Shark, Orka, Piranha, Sea Urchin, and Nagala (bearing the Serpent Crown).
* Doctor Doom – Sometimes allies, sometimes enemies, Doom and Namor use each other but inevitably turn against each other when their ultimate sensibilities override the benefits of working together. This has been their perpetual relationship since first meeting years ago.
* Doctor Dorcas – A brilliant scientist that created several of Namor&#x27;s greatest threats such as Tiger Shark, Orka, and Piranha, often working alongside the likes of Attuma and Byrrah. He appeared to die in a battle with Namor, but later turned up alive with starfish-based abilities.
* Fathom Five – Led by Llyron, the son of Namor&#x27;s enemy Llyra and supposedly Namor himself. Later, it is revealed that Llyron is the grandson of Namor&#x27;s half-brother that was passed off as Namor&#x27;s successor who usurped his throne, Fathom Five sought to wipe out humanity. Its members include Dragonrider, Bloodtide, Manowar, and Sea Leopard.
* Great White – An albino villain and shark trainer. He ambushed Loa and her father while they were surfing. Loa managed to use her ability to kill the sharks while Great White was defeated by Namor.
* Karthon the Quester – A faithful servant to Lemurian ruler Naga that sought the Serpent Crown for his master from Namor. His sense of honor conflicted with his master and after Naga&#x27;s rule was toppled, Karthon became king and an ally to Namor.
* Llyra – A Lemurian that usurped Karthon&#x27;s rule of his kingdom and became Namor&#x27;s enemy when he tried to restore his friend and ally. She would return to face him repeatedly, in time becoming high priestess of Set.
* Magneto – More often amicable allies than anything else, Magneto would approach Namor during his Brotherhood&#x27;s first outing as Supervillains to join forces against humanity. Initially, the latter refused, seeking to work alone, but having worked with the X-Men, Magnus included, Namor respects the mutant revolutionary nonetheless.
* Naga – Longtime wielder of the Serpent Crown, Naga would rule Lemuria until he was murdered by his staunchest aide Karthon.
* Orka – An underling of Krang empowered by Doctor Dorcas to be massively strong and grow stronger in the presence of orca. He would return repeatedly as a minion for Namor&#x27;s enemies.
* Piranha – Created by Doctor Dorcas, the Piranha is an ever-evolving enemy of Namor to return again and again.
* Puppet Master – Using Namor as a pawn on several occasions, such as against the Fantastic Four and in obtaining funds, the Puppet Master would garner the ire of the sea king. On one occasion, when Namor considered befriending the Hulk, Puppet Master took the green behemoth over and forced him to battle Namor.
* Tiger Shark – An Olympic swimmer transformed by Doctor Dorcas into a hybrid of Namor&#x27;s DNA and a tiger shark. He battles Namor repeatedly over the years, at one time an ally to the sea king, though today he has again chosen to be his enemy.
* Tyrak – A powerful warrior in Attuma&#x27;s army that can grow to monstrous size and bears incredible physical strength.
* U-Man – Meranno was a childhood rival to Namor that joined the Third Reich and took the name U-Man. Leading the Nazis to Atlantis, their attack left its emperor in a coma with Namor succeeding him. During World War II, he would be Namor&#x27;s frequent sparring partner.
* Warlord Krang – One-time military leader of Atlantis&#x27; forces, Krang tried to usurp Namor&#x27;s power and became an enemy to the kingdom. He would return repeatedly to challenge Namor.

== Literary reception ==

=== Volumes ===
During the period known as the Golden Age of Comic Books, generally agreed to last from 1938 to 1956, Namor was one of Timely Comics&#x27; &quot;Big Three,&quot; alongside Captain America and the original Human Torch. During this period, Namor&#x27;s &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; title was selling millions of copies.

==== &quot;Namor&quot; (2003) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Namor&quot; #2 was the 43rd best selling comic book in May 2003.

Jared Gaudreau of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; ranked the &quot;Namor&quot; comic book series 2nd in their &quot;15 Best Namor Comics&quot; list, writing, &quot;Along with becoming more narratively rich, this comic gave Namor something he&#x27;d never had before: a serious love interest named Sandra Pierce.&quot;

==== &quot;Namor: The First Mutant&quot; (2010) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Namor: The First Mutant&quot; #1 was the 42nd best selling comic book in August 2010.

Shawn S. Lealos of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; included the &quot;Namor: The First Mutant&quot; comic book series in their &quot;10 Best Ever Namor Comics To Read&quot; list.

==== &quot;Namor: The Best Defense&quot; (2018) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Namor: The Best Defense&quot; #1 was the 50th best selling comic book in December 2018.

Charlie Ridgely of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;Namor: The Best Defense&quot; #1 a grade of 5 out of 5, writing, &quot;Chip Zdarsky has proven in the past that he can write incredibly fun, light-hearted characters like Peter Parker and The Thing. However, he makes a very bold statement with this issue of &quot;Namor&quot;, as he declares that he&#x27;s far more than you might believe him to be. Zdarsky writes the hell out of Namor, who is about as damaged, serious, and complicated as you can get in the Marvel universe. He does so with a precision and depth that is slightly unexpected, but completely refreshing when dealing with a character that has often been underutilized. Between Defenders and Avengers, it&#x27;s very clear that a Namor resurgence is underway, and Chip Zdarsky is leading the charge.&quot;

==Other versions==
===Amalgam Comics===
In the &quot;Amalgam Comics&quot; reality, Namor is combined with DC Comics&#x27; King of Atlantis, Aquaman, to create Aqua Mariner.

===Earth X===
In the &quot;Earth X&quot; series, Namor suffers from dementia due to the Terrigen mists contaminating the oceans. Amid the crisis, Namor is responsible for the death of Johnny Storm as a result of an attack by him and Doctor Doom on the United Nations against the Fantastic Four and Captain America. A furious Franklin Richards used his powers to cause half of Namor&#x27;s body to be continually on fire, now known as Namor the Cursed. Years later, Namor would join The Skull&#x27;s mind-controlled army.

===Exiles===
In &quot;Exiles&quot; issues 14 and 15, Namor appears as a king who has taken over Latveria. Another version of Namor is black and is married to Sue Storm and has a son Remy.

===Marvel 1602===
In the &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; limited series &quot;Fantastick Four&quot;, Namor is reinvented as Numenor, Emperor of Bensaylum, a city beyond the edge of the world.

When the characters arrive in his realm he is arguing with his cousin Rita (Namorita) about her reluctance to marry. She suggests that this is because he refuses to find a consort himself. Upon meeting the Four from the Fantastick, he is attracted to Susan Storm, and attempts to woo her, unsuccessfully. He later plots with Otto von Doom to win her, while &quot;disposing&quot; of Sir Richard Reed. Doom turns against him, and Numenor is stabbed with his own trident and dies. Because Bensaylum is not underwater, its inhabitants are portrayed as basically human although they retain the pointed ears.

===Marvel Noir===
In the &quot;Marvel Noir&quot; reality, Namor is a captain of a ship named &quot;Dorma&quot;. Captain Namor is a widely infamous pirate of the seven seas and an associate of Tony Stark, who pays him for the numerous voyages on his adventures. Namor considers himself as a man of the sea and doesn&#x27;t share any allegiances to any countries or nations. As part of his tradition as a pirate, Namor marks himself and his crew by slicing their ears to look like shark&#x27;s fins. He is the captain of the Dorma, an advanced submarine while taking the guise of a fishing trawler.

In May 1939, Stark hired Namor to find the location of Atlantis. He traveled with Stark, James Rhodes, and Pepper Potts on the submersible, the &quot;Happy Hogan&quot;, in locating Atlantis and finding the valuable Orichalcum. Upon returning to the surface, Namor and his friends were immediately captured by the Nazis led by Baron Zemo and Von Strucker, and the Orichalcum stolen by them. Namor and his allies were then left to die on his trawler by torpedo; Namor took action in having everyone quickly board the Dorma and escape before the torpedo destroyed the trawler. Namor later rescued Stark following the destruction of Von Strucker&#x27;s airship fleet, as (in Namor&#x27;s words) Stark owes him a boat for the destruction of his.

===MC2===
Namor is still active in the MC2 future timeline, and still uniting occasionally for battle alongside the Hulk and Doctor Strange as &quot;Defenders&quot;. His appearance, while slightly older looking, is unchanged save for growing a goatee. In &quot;Fantastic Five&quot; vol. 2 #1 it was revealed that he had held Doctor Doom captive for over ten years after the mad monarch destroyed Atlantis. Doom subsequently escaped, and in #4, Namor is seen being tortured by him. He is freed after Reed Richards sacrifices himself to send both his and Doom&#x27;s consciousnesses to the &quot;Crossroads of Infinity&quot;.

===Sub-Mariner: The Depths===
In the Marvel Knights mini-series set in an alternate 1950s, Namor is fabled among mariners, said to pursue and kill any searching for Atlantis. Randolph Stein, a man who makes a living debunking modern myths, encounters Namor in the ocean depths while trying to find Atlantis.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate version of Namor is a mutant Atlantean with amphibious physiology suited for high water pressure. He has vast super strength, durability, high-speed swimming ability, flight, and water manipulation.

In &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; #24, the eponymous team is surveying the ruins of Atlantis and finds an estimated 9,000-year-old tomb containing the hibernating Namor – an imprisoned Atlantean criminal, considered the worst villain of his time. Reed Richards&#x27; translation of the Atlantean language reveals Namor&#x27;s claims of kingship to be false.

His extreme intelligence allows him to become fluent in English in a matter of minutes merely by listening to S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and the Fantastic Four talking. Confronting the human, Namor withstands full-strength flares from the Human Torch and is strong enough to fight the Thing, withstand Sue Storm&#x27;s force fields, and stretch Richards (Mr. Fantastic) to near-breaking. He destroys machinery designed to contain the Hulk. Though beaten by the Fantastic Four, he creates a tidal wave in the shape of Poseidon, threatening to destroy Manhattan with it. He is appeased when he demands, and receives, a meaningful kiss from Sue Storm. He then returns to the sea.

Namor reappears at the end of issue #55, rescuing an unconscious Sue after she was attacked by the Ultimate version of the Salem&#x27;s Seven. Later, he is seen in Latveria as Doctor Doom&#x27;s prisoner.

===Film===
Development of a film based on Namor the Sub-Mariner began at Marvel Studios in April 1997, when Philip Kaufman was negotiating to direct the film, entitled &quot;Namor: Sub-Mariner&quot;. Kaufman was developing the film the next month when he revealed it would tackle environmental issues by depicting Namor as having &quot;bad feelings&quot; towards the land residents of Earth over ecological concerns. By July 1999, Sam Hamm was in negotiations to write the script. In June 2001, Universal Pictures entered negotiations to gain the rights for Namor, with then Marvel Studios President Avi Arad and Kevin Misher set to produce the film. Arad felt that the film could explore environmental issues such as oil spills, underwater bomb testing, pollution and global warming. By then, writers were being sought for the project. Universal hired David Self to write the script in July 2002 for an intended 2004 release. The following month, Randall Frakes was revealed to have worked on the script for &quot;Namor, the Sub-Mariner&quot; at Saban Entertainment.

In October 2002, Marvel Studios announced that it had finalized a deal with Universal to produce the Sub-Mariner film after their work together on &quot;Hulk&quot; (2003). Avi Arad said the film would be an &quot;epic underwater tale of majestic fantasy&quot;, which Marvel described as following the adventures of Namor as a prince from Atlantis who is a &quot;half-human/half-amphibian&quot; and a &quot;troubled rebel with a short temper&quot; and has helped humans and fought them over pollution. Kevin Feige, Stan Lee, and Self were set as executive producers, while Avi Arad was a co-producer. By July 2004, Marvel and Arad entered negotiations for Chris Columbus to direct the project, and he signed on as director and producer of &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; by that December, developing it through his production company 1492 Pictures. The film was slated for a 2007 release. However, Columbus said in November 2005 that he was unlikely to make the film. In September 2006, Universal and Marvel Studios hired Jonathan Mostow to write and direct &quot;The Sub-Mariner&quot;, with the film following Namor discovering he is a prince of Atlantis who is key in a war between the modern surface world and the underwater world. Feige said the heart of the film&#x27;s story would be &quot;tempered&quot; with Namor being stuck between those two worlds. Mostow said &quot;The Sub-Mariner&quot; was still in active development in August 2009 and that they were still working on getting the script right. He also explained that Universal kept renewing the option to produce the property.

Marvel Entertainment&#x27;s chief creative officer (CCO) Joe Quesada said in May 2012 and June 2016 that to his knowledge, Marvel Studios held the film rights to Namor. In August 2013, Feige, who since became the President of Marvel Studios, said that Universal still held the rights to Namor and that the character would not appear in Marvel Studios&#x27; Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) at that time because of it. In April 2014, Feige said the rights to Namor were a &quot;little complicated,&quot; while &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; Borys Kit revealed in May that Marvel held the Namor rights and not Universal. That July, Feige clarified that Marvel could make a Namor film, instead of Universal and Legendary Pictures as was rumored, but noted there were older contracts with other parties that needed to be worked out before they could move forward with a film. In February 2017, &quot;Production Weekly&quot; included &quot;The Sub-Mariner&quot; in their report of upcoming projects in development, when the production was expected to take place in Hawaii. In April 2018, Feige reiterated Namor&#x27;s rights were complicated, with Universal holding the distribution rights, and said in October that Namor could appear in the MCU and that Marvel Studios was deciding if and when he could. In November 2022, Marvel Studios executive Nate Moore confirmed that they cannot make a standalone Namor film since Universal still holds the character&#x27;s distribution rights, similar to the Hulk. In March 2023, Citigroup financial analyst Jason Bazinet felt Disney may try to include the distribution rights to Namor, along with Hulk, in any potential sale of the streaming service Hulu to Comcast, the owner of Universal Pictures through NBCUniversal.

=== Marvel Cinematic Universe ===

K&#x27;uk&#x27;ulkan / Namor appears in the MCU film &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot; (2022), portrayed by Tenoch Huerta Mejía. This version is the king of Talokan, an ancient civilization of water-dwelling people connected to the Mayas, as well as a mutant. Namor has an antagonistic role in the film, similar to some versions in the comics. Michael Waldron, the writer for the MCU film &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; (2022), previously said there had been talks about including Namor in that film as a member of the Illuminati as in the comics, but his inclusion was dropped because Marvel Studios had other plans for the character. In 1571, his mother Fen ingested a Vibranium-laced herb to gain immunity from smallpox while pregnant with her son. This caused her and the rest of Yucatán&#x27;s people to develop blue skin and grow gills that restricted their ability to breathe air on the surface, forcing them to relocate underwater and establish Talokan as a new civilization. The herb additionally caused her son to undergo a mutation at birth, which gave him pointed ears and winged ankles enabling him to fly, as well as hybrid human physiology that enabled him to breathe oxygen and water simultaneously.

<text>The family Cisticolidae is a group of about 160 warblers, small passerine birds found mainly in warmer southern regions of the Old World. They were formerly included within the Old World warbler family Sylviidae.

This family probably originated in Africa, which has the majority of species, but there are representatives of the family across tropical Asia into Australasia, and one species, the zitting cisticola, breeds in Europe.

These are generally very small birds of drab brown or grey appearance found in open country such as grassland or scrub. They are often difficult to see and many species are similar in appearance, so the song is often the best identification guide. These are insectivorous birds which nest low in vegetation.

==Taxonomy==
The family was introduced (as Cisticolinae) by the Swedish zoologist Carl Jakob Sundevall in 1872.

Many taxonomists place the red-winged prinia and the red-fronted prinia in the genus &quot;Prinia&quot; rather than in their own monotypic genera.
Support for their placement in &quot;Prinia&quot; is provided by a molecular phylogenetic study of the Cisticolidae published in 2013 that found that both species were closely related to the prinias.

The following genus level cladogram of the Cisticolidae is based on a molecular phylogenetic study by Urban Olsson and collaborators that was published in 2013. The number of species in each genus is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).

==List of genera==

<doc id="273469" wikidata="Q3999771" url="?curid=273469" title="Whizzer (comics)">
<text>Whizzer is the name of several fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first character debuted during the Golden Age in &quot;USA Comics&quot; #1 (Aug. 1941), and was reintroduced in &quot;Giant-Size Avengers&quot; #1 (Aug. 1974). A second villainous version debuts during the Silver Age in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #69 (Oct. 1969), and a second heroic version debuting in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #85 (Feb. 1971).

The Whizzer appeared in the second season of the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series &quot;Jessica Jones&quot;, portrayed by Jay Klaitz.

==Publication history==
The first character named the Whizzer first appeared during the Golden Age of comics, and later appeared briefly during the Silver Age.

The second, villainous version appears in the final panel of &quot;The Avengers&quot; #69 (Oct. 1969), the first chapter of a three-issue storyline by writer Roy Thomas and penciller Sal Buscema. The story arc introduced the supervillain team the Squadron Sinister, whose four members were loosely based on heroes in DC Comics&#x27; Justice League of America, with the Whizzer based on the Flash.

==Fictional character biographies==

===Golden Age===
===Silver Age===

The Squadron Sinister are created by the cosmic entity the Grandmaster to battle the Avengers, who are the champions of the time-traveling Kang. The Whizzer, James Sanders, battles Avenger Goliath, but the fight is interrupted by the Black Knight. The Avengers eventually defeat the Squadron, who are abandoned by the Grandmaster. The Squadron reappear in the title &quot;The Defenders&quot;, reunited by the alien Nebulon. The villains receive greater power in exchange for the planet Earth, and create a giant laser cannon in the Arctic to melt the polar ice caps, thereby covering the entirety of the Earth&#x27;s surface in water. The Defenders prevent the scheme and defeat the villains (and Nebulon); Namor the Sub-Mariner humiliates the Whizzer.

Afterward the Whizzer and his two remaining teammates are teleported off world by Nebulon, returning with an energy-draining weapon. The Squadron Sinister plan to threaten the Earth again but are defeated once more by the Defenders and the Avenger Yellowjacket. The character has another brief encounter with several members of the Avengers, who seek a way to separate the Power Prism of Doctor Spectrum from fellow Avenger the Wasp. The Whizzer disassociates himself from the Squadron Sinister and adopts a new costume and alias, Speed Demon.

===Bronze Age===

Roy Thomas and penciller John Buscema created an alternate-universe team of heroes called the Squadron Supreme, who debut in &quot;Avengers&quot; #85 (Feb. 1971). After an initial skirmish with four Avengers, the teams unite to stop a common threat. The characters including the Whizzer, whose name is Stanley Stewart, were identical in name and appearance to the Squadron Sinister, which caused confusion in Marvel&#x27;s production department, as the covers of &quot;The Avengers&quot; #85 and #141 (Nov. 1975) &quot;cover-blurbed&quot; appearances by the Squadron Sinister, when in fact it was the Squadron Supreme that appeared in both issues.

As a result of exposure to the mutagenic effects of a fogbank of unknown nature, Stanley Stewart possesses superhuman speed, stamina, and reflexes. When moving at subsonic speed, the Stewart Whizzer can create cyclones (by running in circles); run up walls and across water. The character has limited immunity to the effects of friction (Stewart wears goggles to protect his eyes), although still generates normal fatigue poisons. As a result, Stewart must consume large amounts of calories and rest after using his superhuman speed powers extensively.

The heroic Whizzer and the Squadron Supreme have another series of skirmishes with the Avengers engineered by the group the Serpent Cartel, but eventually team together and prevent the use of the artifact the Serpent Crown. The character and his teammates briefly feature in the title &quot;Thor&quot;, when the evil version of Hyperion attacks the Earth-712 version and then Thunder God Thor. The Squadron are mind-controlled by the entities the Over-Mind and Null the Living Darkness, but are freed by the Defenders and aid the heroes in defeating the villains.

The character features with the Squadron Supreme in a self-titled 12-issue miniseries (Sept. 1985 – Aug. 1986) by writer Mark Gruenwald. The series also explains why there are the Squadrons Sinister and Supreme are similar: the Grandmaster creates the Squadron Sinister modelled on the already-existing Squadron Supreme of the Earth-712 universe. 
Gruenwald, Ryan, and inker Al Williamson created a graphic-novel sequel which maroons the team in the mainstream Marvel universe. The Whizzer and teammates encounter the hero Quasar, and relocate to the government facility Project Pegasus. After another encounter with the Overmind and a visit to the laboratory world of the Stranger; the Whizzer participates in a &quot;speedster&quot; race organized by Elder of the Universe the Runner attempts (with the Squadron) to return to their universe and with fellow members Hyperion and Doctor Spectrum battle the entity Deathurge.

The entire Squadron Supreme appear in a two-part story with the Avengers that finally returns them to their home universe, where they disband for a time. The Whizzer rejoins his teammates to aid the interdimensional team the Exiles.

===Modern Age===
The mature-audience Marvel MAX imprint showcases the adventures of the Earth-31916 version of the Whizzer, the Atlanta Blur. Also named Stanley Stewart, the character is a young African-American man who develops super-speed as a result of exposure to an alien retrovirus. He initially hides his ability, with the &quot;Atlanta Blur&quot; regarded as an urban legend, but when Hyperion is publicly revealed Stewart also goes public, becoming a celebrity with numerous endorsements. As the Blur, he reluctantly fights crime at the request of Nighthawk.

===Squadron Supreme of America===
A variation of the Stanley Stewart version of Blur appears as a member of the Squadron Supreme of America. This version is a simulacrum created by Mephisto and programmed by the Power Elite. Stanley was programmed to forcefully watch endless loops to keep up his brain speed while watching numerous S.H.I.E.L.D. files and unscrupulous videos. In his personal time, he works as a computer programmer at an office building in Washington DC.

In the team&#x27;s first mission, Whizzer and the Squadron Supreme of America fought Namor and the Defenders of the Deep, when they targeted a Roxxon oil platform off the coast of Alaska.

Soon after, the Squadron Supreme visited another oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The Squadron Supreme then made short work of Namor and the Defenders of the Deep.

During the &quot;War of the Realms&quot; storyline, Stanley was working at his desk until he and the other members of the Squadron Supreme of America were summoned to Washington D.C., where Phil Coulson brought them up to speed with Malekith the Accursed&#x27;s invasion. Blur and the Squadron Supreme of America fight an army of Rock Trolls and Frost Giants. After the Squadron Supreme caused the Frost Giants to retreat, Phil Coulson sends them to Ohio, which has become a battleground.

Blur was with the Squadron Supreme when they attempted to apprehend Black Panther, after he infiltrated the Pentagon to confront Phil Coulson.

==Powers and abilities==
Each of the Whizzers possess superhuman speed.

<doc id="273470" wikidata="Q3070621" url="?curid=273470" title="External beam radiotherapy">
<text>External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is a form of radiotherapy that utilizes a high-energy collimated beam of ionizing radiation, from a source outside the body, to target and kill cancer cells. The radiotherapy beam is composed of particles, which are focussed in a particular direction of travel using collimators. Each radiotherapy beam consists of one type of particle intended for use in treatment, though most beams contain some contamination by other particle types.

Radiotherapy beams are classified by the particle they are intended to deliver, such as photons (as x-rays or gamma rays), electrons, and heavy ions; x-rays and electron beams are by far the most widely used sources for external beam radiotherapy. Orthovoltage (&quot;superficial&quot;) X-rays are used for treating skin cancer and superficial structures. Megavoltage X-rays are used to treat deep-seated tumors (e.g. bladder, bowel, prostate, lung, or brain), whereas megavoltage electron beams are typically used to treat superficial lesions extending to a depth of approximately 5 cm. A small number of centers operate experimental and pilot programs employing beams of heavier particles, particularly protons, owing to the rapid decrease in absorbed dose beneath the depth of the target.

Teletherapy is the most common form of radiotherapy (radiation therapy). The patient sits or lies on a couch and an external source of ionizing radiation is pointed at a particular part of the body. In contrast to brachytherapy (sealed source radiotherapy) and unsealed source radiotherapy, in which the radiation source is inside the body, external beam radiotherapy directs the radiation at the tumor from outside the body.

==X-rays and gamma rays==
Conventionally, the energy of diagnostic and therapeutic gamma- and X-rays is on the order of kiloelectronvolts (keV) or megaelectronvolts (MeV), and the energy of therapeutic electrons is on the order of megaelectronvolts. The beam is made up of a spectrum of energies: the &quot;maximum&quot; energy is approximately equal to the beam&#x27;s maximum electric potential within a linear accelerator times the electron charge. For instance, a 1 megavolt beam will produce photons with a maximum energy around 1 MeV. In practice, the mean X-ray energy is about one-third of the maximum energy. Beam quality and hardness may be improved by X-ray filters, which improves the homogeneity of the X-ray spectrum.

Medically useful X-rays are produced when electrons are accelerated to energies at which either the photoelectric effect predominates (for diagnostic use, since the photoelectric effect offers comparatively excellent contrast with effective atomic number &quot;Z&quot;) or Compton scattering and pair production predominate (at energies above approximately 200 keV for the former and 1 MeV for the latter), for therapeutic X-ray beams. Some examples of X-ray energies used in medicine are:
* Very low-energy superficial X-rays – 35 to 60 keV (mammography, which prioritizes soft-tissue contrast, uses very low-energy kV X-rays)
* Superficial radiotherapy X-rays – 60  to 150 keV
* Diagnostic X-rays – 20 to 150 keV (mammography to CT); this is the range of photon energies at which the photoelectric effect, which gives maximal soft-tissue contrast, predominates.
* Orthovoltage X-rays – 200 to 500 keV
* Supervoltage X-rays – 500 to 1000 keV
* Megavoltage X-rays – 1 to 25 MeV (in practice, nominal energies above 15 MeV are unusual in clinical practice).

Megavoltage X-rays are by far most common in radiotherapy for the treatment of a wide range of cancers. Superficial and orthovoltage X-rays have application for the treatment of cancers at or close to the skin surface. Typically, higher-energy megavoltage X-rays are chosen when it is desirable to maximize &quot;skin-sparing&quot; (since the relative dose to the skin is lower for such high-energy beams).

Medically useful photon beams can also be derived from a radioactive source such as iridium-192, caesium-137, or cobalt-60. (Radium-226 has also been used as such a source in the past, though has been replaced in this capacity by less harmful radioisotopes.) Such photon beams, derived from radioactive decay, are approximately monochromatic, in contrast to the continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum from a linac. These decays include the emission of gamma rays, whose energy is isotope-specific and ranges between 300 keV and 1.5 MeV.
Superficial radiation therapy machines produce low energy x-rays in the same energy range as diagnostic x-ray machines, 20–150 keV, to treat skin conditions. Orthovoltage X-ray machines produce higher energy x-rays in the range 200–500 keV. Radiation from orthovoltage x-ray machines has been called &quot;deep&quot; due to its greater penetrating ability, allowing it to treat tumors at depths unreachable by lower-energy &quot;superficial&quot; radiation. Orthovoltage units have essentially the same design as diagnostic X-ray machines and are generally limited to photon energies less than 600 keV. X-rays with energies on the order of 1 MeV are generated in Linear accelerators (&quot;linacs&quot;). The first use of a linac for medical radiotherapy was in 1953. Commercially available medical linacs produce X-rays and electrons with an energy range from 4 MeV up to around 25 MeV. The X-rays themselves are produced by the rapid deceleration of electrons in a target material, typically a tungsten alloy, which produces an X-ray spectrum via bremsstrahlung radiation. The shape and intensity of the beam produced by a linac may be modified or collimated by a variety of means. Thus, conventional, conformal, intensity-modulated, tomographic, and stereotactic radiotherapy are all provided using specially-modified linear accelerators.
Cobalt units use radiation from cobalt-60, which emits two gamma rays at energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV, a dichromatic beam with an average energy of 1.25 MeV. The role of the cobalt unit has largely been replaced by the linear accelerator, which can generate higher energy radiation. Nonetheless, cobalt treatment still retains some applications, such as the Gamma Knife, since the machinery is relatively reliable and simple to maintain compared to the modern linear accelerator.

Bremsstrahlung X-rays are produced by bombarding energetic cathode rays (electrons) onto a target made of a material with high atomic number, such as tungsten. The target acts as a sort of transducer, converting part of the electrons&#x27; kinetic energy into energetic photons. Kilovoltage X-rays are typically produced using an X-ray tube, in which electrons travel through a vacuum from a hot cathode to a cold anode, which also acts as the target. However, it is impractical to produce megavoltage X-rays using this method; instead, a linear accelerator is most commonly used to produce X-rays of such energy. X-ray emission is more forward-directed at megavoltage energies and more laterally-directed at kilovoltage energies. Consequently, kilovoltage X-rays tend to be produced using a reflection-type target, in which the radiation is emitted back from the target&#x27;s surface, while megavoltage X-rays tend to be produced with a transmission target in which the X-rays are emitted on the side opposite that of electron incidence. Reflection type targets exhibit the heel effect and can use a rotating anode to aid in heat dissipation.

Compton scattering is the dominant interaction between a megavoltage beam and the patient, while the photoelectric effect dominates at keV energies. Additionally, Compton scattering is much less dependent on atomic number than the photoelectric effect; while kilovoltage beams enhance the distinction between muscle and bone in medical imaging, megavoltage beams suppress that distinction to the advantage of teletherapy. Pair production and photoneutron production increase at higher energies, only becoming significant at energies on the order of 1 MeV.

X-ray energy in the keV range is described by the electrical voltage used to produce it. For instance, a 100 kVp beam is produced by a 100 kV voltage applied to an X-ray tube and will have a maximum photon energy of 100 keV. However, the beam&#x27;s spectrum can be affected by other factors as well, such as the voltage waveform and external X-ray filtration. These factors are reflected in the beam&#x27;s half-value layer (HVL), measured in-air under conditions of &quot;good geometry&quot;. A typical superficial X-ray energy might be 100 kVp per 3 mmAl – &quot;100 kilovolts applied to the X-ray tube with a measured half-value layer of 3 millimeters of aluminum&quot;. The half-value layer for orthovoltage beams is more typically measured using copper; a typical orthovoltage energy is 250 kVp per 2 mmCu. For X-rays in the MeV range, an actual voltage of the same magnitude is not used in production of the beam. A 6 MV beam contains photons of no more than 1 MeV, rather than 6 MeV; the energy of such a beam is instead generally characterized by measuring the ratio of the beam&#x27;s intensity at varying depths in a medium.

Kilovoltage beams do not exhibit a build-up effect and thus deposit their maximum dose at the surface, i.e. d = 0 or D = 100%. Conversely, megavoltage beams do exhibit the buildup effect deposit; they deposit their maximum dose at some depth below the surface, i.e. d &gt; 0. The depth of dose maximum is governed by the range of the electrons liberated upstream during Compton scattering. At depths beyond d, the dose profile of all X-ray beams decreases roughly exponentially with depth. Though actual values of d are influenced by various factors, the following are representative benchmark values.

==Electrons==

X-rays are generated by bombarding a high atomic number material with electrons. If the target is removed (and the beam current decreased). a high energy electron beam is obtained. Electron beams are useful for treating superficial lesions, because the maximum dose deposition occurs near the surface and thereafter decreases rapidly with depth, sparing underlying tissue. Electron beams usually have nominal energies in the range of 4–20 MeV, corresponding to a treatment range of approximately 1–5 cm (in water-equivalent tissue). Energies above 18 MeV are rarely used. Although the X-ray target is removed in electron mode, the beam must be fanned out by sets of thin scattering foils in order to achieve flat and symmetric dose profiles in the treated tissue.

Many linear accelerators can produce both electrons and x-rays.

==Hadron therapy==

Hadron therapy involves the therapeutic use of protons, neutrons, and heavier ions (fully ionized atomic nuclei). Of these, proton therapy is by far the most common, though still rare compared to other forms of external beam radiotherapy, since it requires large and expensive equipment. The gantry (the part that rotates around the patient) is a multi-story structure, and a proton therapy system can cost (as of 2009) up to US$150 million.

==Multi-leaf collimator==
Modern linear accelerators are equipped with multileaf collimators (MLCs), which can move within the radiation field as the linac gantry rotates, and block the field as necessary according to the gantry position. This technology allows radiotherapy treatment planners great flexibility in shielding organs-at-risk (OARSs), while ensuring that the prescribed dose is delivered to the target organs. A typical multi-leaf collimator consists of two sets of 40 to 160 leaves, each around 5–10 mm thick and several centimetres long in the other two dimensions. Each leaf in the MLC is aligned parallel to the radiation field and can be moved independently to block part of the field, adapting it to the shape of the tumor (by adjusting the position of the leaves), thus minimizing the amount of healthy tissue subject to radiation exposure. On older linacs without MLCs, this must be accomplished manually using several hand-crafted blocks.

==Intensity modulated radiation therapy==

Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced radiotherapy technique used to minimize the amount of normal tissue being irradiated in the treatment field. In some systems, this intensity modulation is achieved by moving the leaves in the MLC during the course of treatment, thereby delivering a radiation field with a non-uniform (i.e., modulated) intensity. Using IMRT, radiation oncologists are able to split the radiation beam into many beamlets and vary the intensity of each beamlet, and doctors are often able to further limit the amount of radiation received by healthy tissue near the tumor. Doctors have found that this sometimes allows them to safely give a higher dose of radiation to the tumor, potentially increasing the chance of successful treatment.

=== Volumetric modulated arc therapy ===

Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is an extension of IMRT characterized by a linear accelerator rotating around the patient. This means that rather than radiation entering the patient at only a small number of fixed angles, it can enter at many angles. This can be beneficial for some treatment sites in which the target volume is surrounded by a number, allowing directed treatment without exposing nearby organs to heightened radiation levels.

=== Flattening filter free ===
The intensity of the X-rays produced in a megavoltage linac is much higher in the centre of the beam compared to the edges. To offset this central peak, a flattening filter is used. A flattening filter is cone-shaped so as to compensate for the forward bias in the momentum of incident electrons (and is typically made from a metal such as tungsten); after an X-ray beam passes through the flattening filter, it has a more uniform profile. This simplifies treatment planning, though significantly reduces the intensity of the beam. With greater computing power and more efficient treatment planning algorithms, the need for simpler treatment planning techniques – such as &quot;forward planning&quot;, in which the planner directly instructs the linac on how to deliver the prescribed treatment – is reduced. This has led to increased interest in flattening filter free (FFF) treatments.

FFF treatments have been found to have an increased maximum dose rate, allowing reduced treatment times and a reduction in the effect of patient motion on the delivery of the treatment. This makes FFF an area of particular interest in stereotactic treatments. For instance, in treatment of breast cancer, the reduced treatment time may reduce patient movement and breast treatments where there is the potential to reduce breathing motion.

==Image-guided radiation therapy==
Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) augments radiotherapy with imaging to increase the accuracy and precision of target localization, thereby reducing the amount of healthy tissue in the treatment field. To allow patients to benefit from sophisticated treatment techniques as IMRT or hadron therapy, patient alignment accuracies with an error margin of at most 0.5 mm are desirable. Therefore, methods such as stereoscopic digital kilovoltage imaging-based patient position verification (PPVS), and alignment estimation based on in-situ cone-beam computed tomography (CT), enrich the range of modern IGRT approaches.

<doc id="273476" wikidata="Q286410" url="?curid=273476" title="Jonny Greenwood">
<text>Jonathan Richard Guy Greenwood (born 5 November 1971) is an English musician. He is the lead guitarist and keyboardist of the rock band Radiohead, and has composed numerous film scores. He has been named one of the greatest guitarists by numerous publications, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

Along with his elder brother, Colin, Greenwood attended Abingdon School in Abingdon near Oxford, where he formed Radiohead. Their debut single, &quot;Creep&quot; (1992), was distinguished by Greenwood&#x27;s aggressive guitar work. Radiohead have achieved acclaim and sold more than 30 million albums. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Radiohead in 2019.

Greenwood is a multi-instrumentalist and a prominent player of the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument. He uses electronic techniques such as programming, sampling and looping, and writes music software. He described his role in Radiohead as an arranger, helping transform Thom Yorke&#x27;s demos into finished songs. The only classically trained member of Radiohead, Greenwood has composed for orchestras including the London Contemporary Orchestra and the BBC Concert Orchestra, and his arrangements feature on Radiohead records.

Greenwood released his first solo work, the soundtrack for the film &quot;Bodysong&quot;, in 2003. In 2007, he scored &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;, the first of several collaborations with the director Paul Thomas Anderson. In 2018, he was nominated for an Academy Award for his score for Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Phantom Thread&quot;. He was nominated again for his score for &quot;The Power of the Dog&quot; (2021), directed by Jane Campion. Greenwood also scored the Lynne Ramsay films &quot;We Need to Talk About Kevin&quot; (2011) and &quot;You Were Never Really Here&quot; (2017). He has collaborated with Middle Eastern musicians including the Israeli songwriters Shye Ben Tzur and Dudu Tassa. In 2021, Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile, with Yorke and the drummer Tom Skinner.

==Early life==
Jonny Greenwood was born on 5 November 1971 in Oxford, England. His brother, the Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood, is two years older. Their father served in the British Army as a bomb disposal expert. The Greenwood family has historical ties to the Communist Party of Great Britain and the socialist Fabian Society.

When he was a child, Greenwood&#x27;s family would listen to a small number of cassettes in their car, including Mozart&#x27;s horn concertos, the musicals &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, and cover versions of Simon &amp; Garfunkel songs. When the cassettes were not playing, Greenwood would listen to the noise of the engine and try to recall every detail of the music. He credited his older siblings with exposing him to rock bands such as the Beat and New Order. The first gig Greenwood attended was the Fall on their 1988 &quot;Frenz Experiment&quot; tour, which he found &quot;overwhelming&quot;.

The Greenwood brothers attended the private boys&#x27; school Abingdon. The Abingdon director of music, Michael Stinton, recalled Jonny as a &quot;charming student&quot; and &quot;committed musician&quot; who would spend as much time in the music department as possible. Greenwood&#x27;s first instrument was a recorder given to him at age four or five. He played baroque music in recorder groups as a teenager, and continued to play into adulthood. He played the viola in the Thames Vale youth orchestra, which he described as a formative experience: &quot;I&#x27;d been in school orchestras and never seen the point. But in Thames Vale I was suddenly with all these 18-year-olds who could actually play in tune. I remember thinking: &#x27;Ah, that&#x27;s what an orchestra is supposed to sound like! Greenwood also spent time programming, experimenting with BASIC and simple machine code to make computer games. According to Greenwood, &quot;The closer I got to the bare bones of the computer, the more exciting I found it.&quot;

=== On a Friday ===
At Abingdon, the Greenwood brothers formed a band, On a Friday, with the singer Thom Yorke, the guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien and the drummer Philip Selway. Jonny, the youngest, was three school years below Yorke and Colin and the last to join. He was previously in another band, Illiterate Hands, with Matt Hawksworth, Simon Newton, Ben Kendrick, Nigel Powell and Yorke&#x27;s brother, Andy.

Greenwood initially played harmonica and keyboards for On a Friday. As they had fired their previous keyboardist for playing too loudly, Greenwood spent his first months playing with his keyboard turned off. No one in the band realised, and Yorke told him he added an &quot;interesting texture&quot;. According to Greenwood, &quot;I&#x27;d go home in the evening and work out how to actually play chords, and cautiously, over the next few months, I would start turning this keyboard up.&quot; According to Selway, at On a Friday&#x27;s first gig, in Oxford’s Jericho Tavern, Greenwood sat on the stage with a harmonica, “waiting for his big moment to arrive&quot;. He eventually became the lead guitarist. 

Although the other members of On a Friday had left Abingdon by 1987 to attend university, they continued to rehearse on weekends and holidays. Greenwood studied music at A Level, including chorale harmonisation.

==Career==

=== 1991–1992: &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;===
In 1991, the members of On a Friday regrouped in Oxford, sharing a house on the corner of Magdalen Road and Ridgefield Road. Greenwood played harmonica on the 1992 Blind Mr. Jones single &quot;Crazy Jazz&quot;. He enrolled at Oxford Brookes University to study psychology and music, but left after his first term after On a Friday signed a record contract deal with EMI. They changed their name to Radiohead and released their first album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, in 1993. Radiohead found early success with their debut single, &quot;Creep&quot;, released in 1992. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;It was Greenwood&#x27;s gnashing noise blasts that marked Radiohead as more than just another mopey band ... An early indicator of his crucial role in pushing his band forward.&quot;

=== 1995–1999: &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot; ===
Radiohead&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995), brought them significant critical attention. Greenwood said it had been a &quot;turning point&quot; for Radiohead: &quot;It started appearing in people&#x27;s [best of] polls for the end of the year. That&#x27;s when it started to feel like we made the right choice about being a band.&quot; On tour, Greenwood damaged his hearing and wore protective ear shields for some performances.

Radiohead&#x27;s third album, &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), achieved acclaim, showcasing Greenwood&#x27;s lead guitar work on songs such as &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;. For &quot;Climbing up the Walls&quot;, Greenwood wrote a part for 16 stringed instruments playing quarter tones apart, inspired by the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki.

For the soundtrack of the 1998 film &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, Greenwood, Yorke, Andy Mackay of Roxy Music and Bernard Butler of Suede formed a band, the Venus in Furs, and covered three Roxy Music songs. Greenwood played harmonica on &quot;Platform Blues&quot; and &quot;Billie&quot; on Pavement&#x27;s final album, &quot;Terror Twilight&quot; (1999).

=== 2000–2003: &quot;Kid A, Amnesiac&quot; and &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; ===
Radiohead&#x27;s albums &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000) and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; (2001) marked a dramatic change in sound, incorporating influences from electronica, classical music, jazz and krautrock. Greenwood employed a modular synthesiser to build the drum machine rhythm of &quot;Idioteque&quot;, and played ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument similar to a theremin, on several tracks.

For &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot;, Greenwood composed a string section by multitracking his ondes Martenot playing. According to Radiohead&#x27;s producer, Nigel Godrich, when the string players saw Greenwood&#x27;s score &quot;they all just sort of burst into giggles, because they couldn&#x27;t do what he&#x27;d written, because it was impossible—or impossible for them, anyway&quot;. The orchestra leader, John Lubbock, encouraged the musicians to experiment and work with Greenwood&#x27;s &quot;naive&quot; ideas. Greenwood also arranged strings for the &quot;Amnesiac&quot; songs &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;Dollars and Cents&quot;.

Greenwood played guitar on Bryan Ferry&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Frantic&quot;. For Radiohead&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; (2003), Greenwood began using the music programming language Max to sample and manipulate the band&#x27;s playing. After having used effects pedals heavily on previous albums, he challenged himself to create interesting guitar parts without effects.

=== 2003–2006: &quot;Bodysong&quot; and first orchestral work ===

In 2003, Greenwood released his first solo work, the soundtrack for the documentary film &quot;Bodysong&quot;. It incorporates guitar, jazz, and classical music. In 2004, Greenwood and Yorke contributed to the Band Aid 20 single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, produced by Godrich.

Greenwood&#x27;s first work for orchestra, &quot;Smear&quot;, was premiered by the London Sinfonietta in March 2004. In 2005, Greenwood curated a concert as part of the Ether festival in London at with the London Sinfonietta. It featured a new version of &quot;Smear&quot;, the new work &quot;Piano for Children&quot;, and performances of pieces by classical modernist composers. With the orchestra, Greenwood also performed two Radiohead songs with Yorke: &quot;Where Bluebirds Fly&quot; and &quot;Weird Fishes / Arpeggi&quot;.

In May 2004, Greenwood was appointed composer-in-residence to the BBC Concert Orchestra. Radiohead&#x27;s co-manager, Bryce Edge, said Greenwood would use the residency to learn how orchestras work. For the BBC, Greenwood wrote &quot;Popcorn Superhet Receiver&quot; (2005), inspired by radio static and the elaborate, dissonant tone clusters of Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima &quot;(1960). He wrote the piece by recording individual tones on viola, then manipulating and overdubbing them in Pro Tools. For &quot;Popcorn Supherhet Receiver&quot;, Greenwood was named Composer of the Year by BBC Radio 3.

For the 2005 film &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, Greenwood and the Radiohead drummer, Philip Selway, appeared as the wizard rock band Weird Sisters alongside Jarvis Cocker, Steve Mackey, Steven Claydon and Jason Buckle. They recorded three songs for the soundtrack and appeared in the film. Greenwood contributed piano to &quot;The Eraser&quot; from Yorke&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;The Eraser&quot; (2006).

=== 2007–2010: &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; and &quot;In Rainbows&quot; ===
Greenwood composed the score for the 2007 film &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. The soundtrack won an award at the Critics&#x27; Choice Awards and the Best Film Score award in the Evening Standard British Film Awards for 2007. As it contains excerpts from &quot;Popcorn Superhet Receiver&quot;, it was ineligible for an Academy Award. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; the best film of the decade and described the score as &quot;a sonic explosion that reinvented what film music could be&quot;. In 2016, the film composer Hans Zimmer said the score was &quot;recklessly, crazily beautiful&quot;.

Greenwood curated a compilation album of reggae tracks, &quot;Jonny Greenwood Is the Controller&quot;, released by Trojan Records in March 2007. It features mostly 70s roots and dub tracks from artists including Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, Joe Gibbs and Linval Thompson. The title references Thompson&#x27;s track &quot;Dread Are the Controller&quot;.

Radiohead released their seventh album, &quot;In Rainbows&quot;, in October 2007, in a landmark use of the pay-what-you-want model for music sales. Greenwood said Radiohead were responding to the culture of downloading free music, which he likened to the legend of King Canute: &quot;You can&#x27;t pretend the flood isn&#x27;t happening.&quot; Greenwood wrote the title music for Adam Buxton&#x27;s 2008 sketch show &quot;Meebox&quot;, and contributed to the 2009 album &quot;Basof Mitraglim Le&#x27;Hakol&quot; by the Israeli rock musician Dudu Tasaa.

=== 2010–2013: &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; and &quot;The King of Limbs&quot; ===
In February 2010, Greenwood debuted a new composition, &quot;Doghouse&quot;, at the BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale Studios. He wrote it in hotels and dressing rooms while on tour with Radiohead. He expanded &quot;Doghouse&quot; into the score for the Japanese film &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, released later that year. Greenwood played guitar on Bryan Ferry&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Olympia&quot;.

Radiohead&#x27;s recorded their eighth album, &quot;The King of Limbs&quot; (2011), using sampler software written by Greenwood. By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums. That year, Greenwood scored &quot;We Need to Talk About Kevin&quot;, directed by Lynne Ramsay, using instruments including a wire-strung harp. With Yorke, he also collaborated with the rapper MF Doom on the track &quot;Retarded Fren&quot;.

In 2012, Greenwood composed the score for Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;The Master&quot;. That March, Greenwood and the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki, one of Greenwood&#x27;s greatest influences, released an album comprising Penderecki&#x27;s 1960s compositions &quot;Polymorphia&quot; &quot;and Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima&quot;, Greenwood&#x27;s &quot;Popcorn Superhet Receiver&quot;, and a new work by Greenwood, &quot;48 Responses to &quot;Polymorphia&quot;&quot;.

In the same year, Greenwood accepted a three-month residency with the Australian Chamber Orchestra in Sydney and composed a new piece, &quot;Water&quot;. Greenwood, Yorke, and other artists contributed music to &quot;The UK Gold&quot;, a 2013 documentary about tax avoidance in the UK. The soundtrack was released free in February 2015 through the online audio platform SoundCloud.

=== 2014–2016: &quot;Inherent Vice&quot;, &quot;Junun&quot; and &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot; ===
Greenwood composed the soundtrack for the Anderson film &quot;Inherent Vice&quot; (2014). It features a new version of an unreleased Radiohead song, &quot;Spooks&quot;, performed by Greenwood and two members of Supergrass. 

In 2014, Greenwood performed with the London Contemporary Orchestra, performing selections from his soundtracks alongside new compositions. In the same year, Greenwood performed with the Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur and his band. Greenwood described Ben Tzur&#x27;s music as &quot;quite celebratory, more like gospel music than anything—except that it&#x27;s all done to a backing of Indian harmoniums and percussion&quot;. He said he would play a &quot;supportive&quot; rather than &quot;solistic&quot; role.

In 2015, Greenwood, Ben Tzur and Godrich recorded an album, &quot;Junun&quot;, with Indian musicians at Mehrangarh Fort in Rajasthan, India. Greenwood insisted they hire only musicians from Rajasthan and only use string instruments native to the region. Ben Tzur wrote the songs, with Greenwood contributing guitar, bass, keyboards, ondes Martenot and programming. Whereas western music is based on harmonies and chord progressions, Greenwood used North Indian ragas. Greenwood and Godrich said they wanted to avoid the &quot;obsession&quot; with high fidelity in recording world music, and instead hoped to capture the &quot;dirt&quot; and &quot;roughness&quot; of music in India. The recording is the subject of a 2015 documentary, &quot;Junun&quot;, by Paul Thomas Anderson.

Greenwood contributed string orchestration to Frank Ocean&#x27;s 2016 albums &quot;Endless&quot; and &quot;Blonde&quot;. Radiohead&#x27;s ninth album, &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot;, was released in May 2016, featuring strings and choral vocals arranged by Greenwood and performed by the London Contemporary Orchestra. With Ben Tzur and the Indian ensemble, Greenwood supported Radiohead&#x27;s 2018 &quot;Moon Shaped Pool&quot; tour under the name Junun.

=== 2017–2020: &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; and &quot;The Power of the Dog&quot; ===
Greenwood wrote the score for Anderson&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;Phantom Thread&quot;. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score and earned Greenwood his sixth Ivor Novello award. In the same year, he reunited with Ramsay to score her film &quot;You Were Never Really Here&quot;. At the 2019 BBC Proms in London, Greenwood debuted his composition &quot;Horror Vacui&quot; for solo violin and 68 string instruments.

Greenwood was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Radiohead in March 2019. Greenwood did not attend the event, and told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t care. Maybe it&#x27;s a cultural thing that I really don&#x27;t understand ... It&#x27;s quite a self-regarding profession anyway. And anything that heightens that just makes me feel even more uncomfortable.&quot;

In September 2019, Greenwood launched a record label, Octatonic Records, to release contemporary classical music by soloists and small groups he had met as a film composer. In 2021, he expressed uncertainty about releasing further Octatonic records, as the two records they had released &quot;seemed to not really connect with anybody&quot;. In 2024, Greenwood said he planned to revive Octatonic with a release from the cellist Oliver Coates.

For the soundtrack for &quot;The Power of the Dog&quot; (2021), Greenwood played the cello in the style of a banjo and recorded a piece for player piano controlled with the software Max. The soundtrack earned Greenwood his second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Score. For his soundtrack to&quot; Spencer&quot; (2021), Greenwood combined Baroque and jazz music, juxtaposing the &quot;rigid&quot; and &quot;colourful&quot; styles. He also contributed cues to Anderson&#x27;s 2021 film &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot;.

=== 2021–2023: the Smile and &quot;Jarak Qaribak&quot; ===

In 2021, Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile, with Yorke and the jazz drummer Tom Skinner. Greenwood said the project was a way for him and Yorke to work together during the COVID-19 lockdowns. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; attributed the Smile to Greenwood&#x27;s frustration with Radiohead&#x27;s slow working pace and his desire to release records that are &quot;90 percent as good [that] come out twice as often&quot;. The Smile made their surprise debut in a performance streamed by Glastonbury Festival on 22 May, with Greenwood playing guitar and bass.

The &quot;Guardian&quot; critic Alexis Petridis said the Smile &quot;sound like a simultaneously more skeletal and knottier version of Radiohead&quot;, exploring more progressive rock influences with unusual time signatures, complex riffs and &quot;hard-driving&quot; motorik psychedelia. In May 2022, the Smile released their debut album, &quot;A Light for Attracting Attention&quot;, and began an international tour. Greenwood and Yorke contributed music to the sixth series of the television drama &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;, broadcast that year.

On 9 June 2023, Greenwood and the Israeli musician Dudu Tassa released &quot;Jarak Qaribak&quot;, an album of Middle Eastern love songs. It was produced by Greenwood and Tassa and mixed by Godrich, and features several Middle Eastern musicians. Greenwood said he and Tassa had &quot;tried to imagine what Kraftwerk would have done if they&#x27;d been in Cairo in the 1970s&quot;. He denied any intent to make a political point with the album, and said: &quot;I do understand that as soon as you do anything in that part of the world it becomes political ... possibly especially if it&#x27;s artistic.&quot; Greenwood composed and conducted strings for the Pretenders song &quot;I Think About You Daily&quot;, released in the same month.

=== 2024–present: &quot;Wall of Eyes&quot; and &quot;Cutouts&quot; ===
In January 2024, the Smile released their second album, &quot;Wall of Eyes&quot;. They began a European tour in March. In May, a drone-based composition by Greenwood for church organ, &quot;X Years of Reverb&quot; — where X is substituted for the age of the building in which it is performed — premiered at the Norfolk and Norwich Festival. The composition is eight hours long and was performed by the organists James McVinnie and Eliza McCarthy playing in shifts using stopwatches. Greenwood composed it after becoming involved in charities to repair churches damaged by an earthquake near his home in Marche, Italy.

On 25 May Greenwood joined protests in Israel calling for the removal of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, elections for new leadership, and the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The next day, he and Tassa performed songs from &quot;Jarak Garibak&quot; in Tel Aviv. The performance was criticised by pro-Palestine activists; the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel called for &quot;peaceful, creative pressure on his band Radiohead to convincingly distance itself from this blatant complicity in the crime of crimes, or face grassroots measures&quot;. On June 4, Greenwood responded to the criticism and wrote in a statement that Israeli artists should not be silenced. He described the project as a group of Middle Eastern musicians &quot;working together across borders&quot;, and made no mention of Israel&#x27;s war efforts. 

In July, the Smile canceled their upcoming European tour after Greenwood was temporarily hospitalised with a serious infection. In a statement, the Smile said Greenwood had been receiving emergency treatment in an intensive care unit, but was now safe. In October, Greenwood said he was mostly recovered and focusing on film soundtracks until he is fully well again. The Smile&#x27;s third album, &quot;Cutouts&quot;, recorded simultaneously with &quot;Wall of Eyes&quot;, was released that month.

== Musicianship ==
=== Guitar ===
Greenwood is Radiohead&#x27;s lead guitarist. He is known for his aggressive playing style. &quot;Guitar.com&quot; wrote that Greenwood&#x27;s playing on Radiohead&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, was an &quot;exhilarating melange of tremolo-picked soundscapes, chunky octaves, screaming high-register runs and killswitch antics&quot;. In the 1990s, Greenwood developed repetitive stress injury, necessitating a brace on his right arm, which he likened to &quot;taping up your fingers before a boxing match&quot;.

Greenwood said he dislikes the reputation of guitars as something to be &quot;admired or worshipped&quot;, and instead sees them as a tool like a typewriter or a vacuum cleaner. He said he disliked guitar solos: &quot;There&#x27;s nothing worse than hearing someone cautiously going up and down the scales of their guitar. You can hear them thinking about what the next note should be, and then out it comes. It&#x27;s more interesting to write something that doesn&#x27;t outstay its welcome.&quot;

Greenwood&#x27;s main amplifiers are a Vox AC30 and a Fender 85. For most Radiohead songs, he uses a Fender Telecaster Plus, a model of Telecaster that uses Lace Sensor pickups. According to &quot;Far Out&quot;, Greenwood used the Telecaster&#x27;s &quot;power and instability&quot; to produce a &quot;punchy&quot; sound that helped set Radiohead apart in the 1990s. On softer tracks, such as &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; and &quot;Let Down&quot; from &quot;OK Computer&quot; and &quot;You And Whose Army?&quot; from &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, Greenwood plays a Fender Starcaster. He sometimes plays with a violin bow. For solo performances and his work with the Smile, Greenwood plays a Gibson Les Paul; for bass, he plays a Fender Precision Bass, using an aggressive picking style. 

Greenwood often uses effect pedals, such as the Marshall ShredMaster distortion pedal used on many 1990s Radiohead songs. For the &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; riff, he uses a DigiTech Whammy pedal to pitch-shift his guitar by one octave, creating a &quot;glitchy, lo-fi&quot; sound. On &quot;Identikit&quot; and several Smile songs, Greenwood uses a delay effect to create &quot;angular&quot; synchronised repeats. Greenwood said that &quot;treating the delay as [the guitar&#x27;s] equal opened up lots of directions&quot;. 

In 2008, &quot;Guitar World&quot; named Greenwood&#x27;s guitar solo in &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; the 34th-greatest. In 2010, &quot;NME&quot; named Greenwood one of the greatest living guitarists, and he was voted the seventh-greatest guitarist of all time in a poll of more than 30,000 BBC 6 Music listeners. That year, the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist David Fricke named Greenwood the 60th-greatest guitarist. A panel of musicians and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writers voted him the 48th-greatest guitarist in 2011, and in 2012 &quot;Spin&quot; ranked him the 29th. In its updated 2023 list of the greatest guitarists, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Greenwood and O&#x27;Brien joint 43rd, writing: &quot;Even as he blossomed into a noted neo-classical composer, Greenwood always made sure to throw in at least one brain-scrambling banger of a guitar part per album.&quot;

=== Ondes Martenot ===
Greenwood is a prominent player of the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument played by moving a ring along a wire, creating sounds similar to a theremin. He first used it on Radiohead&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Kid A&quot;, and it appears in Radiohead songs including &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; and &quot;Where I End and You Begin&quot;.

Greenwood became interested in the ondes Martenot at the age of 15 after hearing Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Turangalîla Symphony&quot;. He said he was partly attracted to the instrument as he cannot sing: &quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted to be able to play an instrument that was like singing, and there&#x27;s nothing closer.&quot; As production of the ondes Martenot ceased in 1988, Greenwood had a replica created to take on tour with Radiohead in 2001 for fear of damaging his original model.

=== Other instruments ===
Greenwood plays instruments including piano, viola, cello, glockenspiel, harmonica, recorder, organ, banjo and harp. He said he enjoyed &quot;struggling with instruments I can&#x27;t really play&quot;, and that he enjoyed playing glockenspiel with Radiohead as much as he did guitar.

Greenwood created the rhythm for &quot;Idioteque&quot; (from &quot;Kid A&quot;) with a modular synthesiser and sampled the song&#x27;s four-chord synthesiser phrase from &quot;mild und leise&quot;, a computer music piece by Paul Lansky. He uses a Kaoss Pad to manipulate Yorke&#x27;s vocals during performances of the &quot;Kid A&quot; song &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot;. In 2014, Greenwood wrote of his fascination with Indian instruments, particularly the tanpura, which he felt created uniquely complex &quot;walls&quot; of sounds.

Greenwood uses a &quot;home-made sound machine&quot; comprising small hammers striking objects including yoghurt cartons, tubs, bells, and tambourines. He has used found sounds, using a television and a transistor radio on &quot;Climbing Up the Walls&quot; (from &quot;OK Computer&quot;) and &quot;The National Anthem&quot; (from &quot;Kid A&quot;).

=== Software ===
At the suggestion of Radiohead&#x27;s producer, Nigel Godrich, Greenwood began using the music programming language Max. He found it liberating to abandon existing notions of audio effects and create his own from scratch, thinking &quot;in terms of sound and maths&quot;. Examples of Greenwood&#x27;s use of Max include the processed piano on the &quot;Moon Shaped Pool&quot; track &quot;Glass Eyes&quot; and his signature &quot;stutter&quot; guitar effect used on tracks such as the 2003 single &quot;Go to Sleep&quot;. He used Max to write sampling software used to create Radiohead&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;The King of Limbs&quot;.

=== Songwriting ===
Greenwood is the only classically trained member of Radiohead. The &quot;New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;the guy who can take an abstract Thom Yorke notion and master the tools required to execute it in the real world&quot;. In 2016, Greenwood described his role in Radiohead as an arranger, and said: &quot;It&#x27;s not really about can I do my guitar part now, it&#x27;s more ... What will serve this song best? How do we not mess up this really good song? ... How do we make it better than [Thom] just playing it by himself, which is already usually quite great?&quot; He said he was the most impatient member of Radiohead: &quot;I&#x27;d much rather the records were 90 per cent as good, but come out twice as often ... I&#x27;ve always felt that, the closer to the finish, the smaller the changes are that anyone would notice.&quot;

Greenwood&#x27;s major writing contributions to Radiohead include &quot;Just&quot; (which Yorke described as &quot;a competition by me and Jonny to get as many chords as possible into a song&quot;); &quot;My Iron Lung&quot;, co-written with Yorke, from &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995); &quot;The Tourist&quot; and the &quot;rain down&quot; bridge of &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; from &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997); the vocal melody of &quot;Kid A&quot; from &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000); and the guitar melody of &quot;A Wolf At The Door&quot; from &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot; (2003).

For his film soundtracks, Greenwood attempts to keep the instrumentation contemporary to the period of the story. For example, he recorded the &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; soundtrack using a 1960s Japanese nylon-strung guitar with home recording equipment from the period, attempting to create a recording that one of the characters might have made. Many of Greenwood&#x27;s compositions are microtonal. He often uses modes of limited transposition, particularly the octatonic scale, saying: &quot;I like to know what I &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; do and then work inside that.&quot; Greenwood has used unusual notation for his scores to convey complexities such as microtonality or improvisation. His piece &quot;X Years of Reverb&quot; requires organists to play to stopwatches. For &quot;48 Responses to &quot;Polymorphia&quot;&quot;, he placed an oak leaf on a stave and wrote a part using the veins.

=== Influences ===
Greenwood admires the alternative rock bands Pavement, the Pixies and Sonic Youth. Greenwood said the guitarist that had most influenced him was John McGeoch of Magazine, whose songwriting &quot;informs so much of what [Radiohead] do&quot;. He declined an offer to fill in for McGeoch, who died in 2004, during Magazine&#x27;s 2009 reunion tour. According to the Radiohead collaborator Adam Buxton, Jonny was &quot;overwhelmed&quot; and too shy to accept the role. 

Greenwood first heard Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s Turangalîla Symphony at the age of 15 and became &quot;round-the-bend-obsessed with it&quot;. Messiaen was Greenwood&#x27;s &quot;first connection&quot; to classical music, and remains an influence; he said: &quot;He was still alive when I was 15, and for whatever reason I felt I could equate him with my other favourite bands—there was no big posthumous reputation to put me off. So I&#x27;m still very fond of writing things in the same modes of limited transposition that he used.&quot;

Greenwood is an admirer of the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki, and cited a concert of Penderecki&#x27;s music in the early 90s as a &quot;conversion experience&quot;. He is also a fan of the composers György Ligeti, Henri Dutilleux and Steve Reich. He has performed Reich&#x27;s 1987 guitar composition &quot;Electric Counterpoint&quot; and recorded a version for Reich&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Radio Rewrite&quot;. Greenwood cited the jazz musician Alice Coltrane as an influence.

Greenwood was exposed to Middle Eastern music through his wife&#x27;s family. He said he particularly admired the textures and complexity of the rhythms in songs such as those by Abdel Halim Hafez, which he tried to emulate. He also said he enjoyed their rhythmic ambiguity, when it is difficult to tell where the first beat in a bar is. 

==Personal life==
Greenwood is married to the Israeli visual artist Sharona Katan, whom he met in 1993 when Radiohead performed in Israel. Her work (credited as Shin Katan) appears on the covers of &quot;Junun&quot; and several of Greenwood&#x27;s soundtracks. Katan said she considers their family Jewish: &quot;Our kids are raised as Jews, we have a mezuzah in our house, we sometimes have Shabbos dinners, we celebrate Jewish holidays. The kids don&#x27;t eat pork. It&#x27;s important to me to keep this stuff.&quot; Greenwood&#x27;s nephew served in the Israeli Defense Forces and was killed in the ongoing Israel–Hamas war.

Greenwood and his family live in Oxford and Marche, Italy. In February 2021, Greenwood appeared on the BBC Radio 4 program &quot;Saturday Live;&quot; his selected &quot;Inheritance Tracks&quot; were &quot;Sweetheart Contract&quot; by Magazine and &quot;Brotherhood of Man&quot; by Oscar Peterson and Clark Terry. Greenwood is red–green colour blind. In April 2023, Greenwood began selling olive oil produced on his farm in Italy from Radiohead&#x27;s online shop.

<text>The Chattahoochee River () is a river in the Southeastern United States. It forms the southern half of the Alabama and Georgia border, as well as a portion of the Florida and Georgia border. It is a tributary of the Apalachicola River, a relatively short river formed by the confluence of the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers and emptying from Florida into Apalachicola Bay in the Gulf of Mexico. The Chattahoochee River is about long. The Chattahoochee, Flint, and Apalachicola rivers together make up the Apalachicola–Chattahoochee–Flint River Basin (ACF River Basin). The Chattahoochee makes up the largest part of the ACF&#x27;s drainage basin.

==Course==
The source of the Chattahoochee River is located in Jacks Gap at the southeastern foot of Jacks Knob, in the very southeastern corner of Union County, in the southern Blue Ridge Mountains, a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains. The headwaters of the river flow south from ridges that form the Tennessee Valley Divide. The Appalachian Trail crosses the river&#x27;s uppermost headwaters. The Chattahoochee&#x27;s source and upper course lie within Chattahoochee National Forest.

From its source in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Chattahoochee River flows southwesterly to Atlanta and through its suburbs. It eventually turns due-south to form the southern half of the Georgia/Alabama state line. Flowing through a series of reservoirs and artificial lakes, it flows by Columbus, the second-largest city in Georgia, and the Fort Moore Army base. At Columbus, it crosses the Fall Line of the eastern United States.

From Lake Oliver to Fort Moore, the Chattahoochee Riverwalk provides cycling, rollerblading, and walking along of the river&#x27;s banks. Farther south, it merges with the Flint River and other tributaries at Lake Seminole near Bainbridge, to form the Apalachicola River that flows into the Florida Panhandle. The Chattahoochee River ends in the city of Chattahoochee, FL. From there, the same river is then named Apalachicola River, which ends (106 miles away) in the city of Apalachicola, FL (meaning both rivers end in the city named after them). Although the same river, this portion was given a different name by separated settlers in different regions during the colonial times.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Chattahoochee&quot; is thought to come from a Muskogee word meaning &quot;rocks-marked&quot; (or &quot;painted&quot;), from &quot;chato&quot; (&quot;rock&quot;) plus &quot;huchi&quot; (&quot;marked&quot;). This possibly refers to the many colorful granite outcroppings along the northeast-to-southwest segment of the river. Much of that segment of the river runs through the Brevard fault zone.

==History==

=== Geologic history ===
The current course of the Chattahoochee River has a geologic history that extends back in time at least 100 million years. A Late Cretaceous system of paleovalleys incised into the Coastal Plain unconformity in the vicinity of Columbus, Georgia is infilled with fluvial sands and gravels of the lower Tuscaloosa Formation. Younger rocks of the overlying Eutaw Formation record an estuarine environment in approximately the same location, suggesting a persistent paleodrainage system in the vicinity of the modern Chattahoochee for at least 10-20 million years during the Late Cretaceous. North of the Fall Line, in the Piedmont of Georgia and Alabama, the course of the Chattahoochee River cuts across prominent, resistant rock layers, including the Hollis Quartzite of the Pine Mountain belt, and must have established its current course prior to uplift of those units. At the mouth of the Chattahoochee-Flint-Apalachicola River system, in the Apalachicola River delta, the geologic history of the delta can be traced at least as far back as the Miocene.

===Early history===
The vicinity of the Chattahoochee River was inhabited in prehistoric times by indigenous peoples since at least 1000 BC. The Kolomoki Mounds, now protected in the Kolomoki Mounds Historic Park near present-day Blakely in Early County, southwest Georgia, were built between 350 AD and 650 AD and constitute the largest mound complex in the state.

===American Civil War===
The Chattahoochee River was of considerable strategic importance during the Atlanta Campaign by Union General William Tecumseh Sherman of the American Civil War.

Between the tributaries of Proctor Creek and Nickajack Creek on the Cobb and Fulton county lines in metropolitan Atlanta, are nine remaining fortifications nicknamed &quot;Shoupades&quot; that were part of a defensive line occupied by the Confederate Army in early July 1864. Designed by Confederate Brigadier General Francis A. Shoup, the line became known as Johnston&#x27;s River Line after Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

A month prior to the Battle of Atlanta, Shoup talked with Johnston on June 18, 1864, about building fortifications. Johnston agreed, and Shoup supervised the building of 36 small elevated earth and wooden triangular fortifications, arranged in a sawtooth pattern to maximize the crossfire of defenders. Sherman tried to avoid the Shoupade defenses by crossing the river to the northeast. The nine remaining Shoupades consist of the earthworks portion of the original earth and wooden structures; they are endangered by land development in the area.

Two of the last battles of the war, West Point and Columbus took place at strategically important crossings of the Chattahoochee.

===Recent history===
Since the nineteenth century, early improvements and alterations to the river were for the purposes of navigation. The river was important for carrying trade and passengers and was a major transportation route.

In the twentieth century, the United States Congress passed legislation in 1944 and 1945 to improve navigation for commercial traffic on the river, as well as to establish hydroelectric power and recreational facilities on a series of lakes to be created by building dams and establishing reservoirs. Creating the manmade, 46,000-acre Walter F. George Lake also known as Lake Eufaula, in Eufaula, Alabama, required evacuating numerous communities, including the historically majority-Native American settlement of Oketeyeconne, Georgia. The lakes were complete in 1963, covering over numerous historic and prehistoric sites of settlement.

Beginning in the late twentieth century, the nonprofit organization called &quot;Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper&quot; has advocated for the preservation of the environment and ecology of the northern part of the river, especially the part traversing Metropolitan Atlanta.

In 2010, a campaign to create a whitewater river course was launched in the portion of the Chattahoochee River that runs through Columbus, Georgia. Between 2010 and 2013, construction took place on the river, the Eagle and Phenix and City Mills Dams were breached and a 2.5 mile Whitewater Course was formed in Uptown, Columbus. The project returned the river to its natural path across the Fall Line, as well as creating the longest urban whitewater course in the world.

==Modifications==
Several large manmade reservoirs, including Lanier, Lake Eufaula, West Point, and George W. Andrews, lakes are controlled by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The dams and reservoirs were developed following legislation by Congress of the mid-1940s for flood control, domestic and industrial water, hydroelectricity, recreation, and improved navigation for river barges. Most of the lakes were completed by 1963. Numerous historic and prehistoric sites were covered over by the lakes during the flooding of the reservoirs, including Oketeyconne, Georgia.

The Georgia Power Company also owns a small series of dams along the middle portion of the river (the Columbus area) between West Point Lake and Lake Walter F. George. Several smaller and older lakes and dams also provide these services on a much smaller and more localized scale, including Bull Sluice Lake, which is held by the Morgan Falls Dam. This dam was built by the Georgia Railway and Power Company in 1902 to provide electric power for the Atlanta trolley system, which has long since been replaced by other forms of transportation.

==River borders==

At various points, the Chattahoochee serves as the boundary between several counties and cities, as well as forming the lower half of the boundary between Alabama and Georgia.

Within Georgia, it divides:

* Habersham County and White County
* Forsyth County and Hall County
* Forsyth County and Gwinnett County
* Fulton County and Gwinnett County
* Sandy Springs and Roswell
* Cobb County and Fulton County
* Douglas County and Fulton County
* Carroll County and Fulton County
* Carroll County and Coweta County
* Columbus, Georgia and Phenix City, Alabama
* Georgetown, Georgia and Eufaula, Alabama

==Atlanta==

Atlanta is built upon the crest of a large ridge, rather than in the floodplain of the river. This has contributed to the preservation of much of the natural scenic beauty of the section that runs through metropolitan Atlanta. North of the metropolis, the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area protects other portions of the riverbanks in a region that is spread across several disconnected areas.

The river traverses much of Atlanta&#x27;s hilly topography of the northern suburbs. Wealthy suburban communities in northern metro Atlanta that abut the river include: Vinings, Buckhead, Sandy Springs, East Cobb, Roswell, Dunwoody, Peachtree Corners, Duluth, Johns Creek, and Berkeley Lake.

Since three states have needs related to the river, there has been increasing controversy since the late twentieth century related to competing development among the regions and the implications for the river. The enormous growth of metropolitan Atlanta has increased its water withdrawals from the river. This has effects downstream. For example, the oysters in the Apalachicola Bay of Florida depend on the brackish water mixture of river and ocean water, and the alternating freshwater and saltwater flows that the river and the tides provide. The amount of flow in the Chattahoochee has also been decreased by interbasin water transfers, where water is withdrawn from the Chattahoochee, but discharged as treated sewage water into another river, such as the Oconee River, which flow to the Atlantic Seaboard via the Altamaha River.

Interest groups and the state of Florida have asked the U.S. Congress to intervene to reduce the priority given to put navigation of the lower Chattahoochee, south of Columbus, by river barge. This requirement causes large water withdrawals, which environmental supporters consider a waste of water needed to support habitats, especially during droughts. The navigation issue has aggravated the fight between Georgia, Florida, and Alabama over rights to the river water. A lawsuit has been filed in the case to reduce priorities given to navigation. The lawsuit is now in court, and may take years to resolve.

==Flooding==
The most recent major flooding of the Chattahoochee River took place in November 2009. This was caused by torrential rains from Tropical Storm Ida as it tore through the Georgia Piedmont. Downstream from Roswell, the Chattahoochee River remained in moderate flood stage. Streams affected by the September 2009 floods included the following:
* Chattahoochee River
* Vickery Creek
* Johns Creek
* Sweetwater Creek
* Nancy Creek
* Peachtree Creek
* Oconee River
* James Creek

The second most recent major flood along the river occurred during the 2009 Georgia floods, with of water recorded at Vinings at the northwestern Atlanta city limit. The flood was over higher than the previous flood recorded in September 2004, as a result of Hurricane Fred. Numerous tributaries also swelled far over and beyond their banks. These were the highest water levels seen since 1990, and the second-highest ever since the large Buford Dam was built upstream. The National Weather Service in Peachtree City estimated that this was a 500-year flood event.

==Gauges==
The main stream gauges are located:

* at Helen (near downtown)
* near Cornelia (6 miles or 10 km northwest of)
* near Buford (4 miles or 6 km northwest of) immediately down from Buford Dam
* near Norcross (5 miles or 8 km north of) on Medlock Bridge Road
* near Roswell (4 miles or 6 km southeast of) just off old Riverside Road
* below Morgan Falls Dam TW
* at Vinings (3 miles or 5 km southwest of) and Atlanta on Pace&#x27;s Ferry Road bridge
* near Campbellton (1 mile or 2 km northwest of) and Fairburn on Georgia 92 bridge
* at Whitesburg (2 miles or 3 km southeast of) at Main Street (Georgia 16) bridge
* at Franklin at Main Street (U.S. 27) bridge in downtown
* at West Point (1 mile or 2 km &quot;northeast&quot;, actually north, of the center of town)
* at Columbus on 14th Street N (U.S. 280) bridge to Phenix City, Alabama
* at Walter F. George Dam (USACE) in Fort Gaines
* at George W. Andrews Lake &amp; dam (USACE) south of Columbia, Alabama then in November 2009 it flooded Vinings again.

Water-level forecasts are regularly issued only at Vinings and Atlanta. Forecasts are issued only during high water at Norcross, Whitesburg, West Point, and the Lake Walter F. George and Andrews Dams. All other locations have observations only.

==Popular culture==
The beauty of the Chattahoochee River is commemorated in the poem &quot;The Song of the Chattahoochee&quot; (1877), by the noted Georgian poet Sidney Lanier. Lake Lanier on the Chattahoochee is named for him.

Country music artist Alan Jackson released his song &quot;Chattahoochee&quot; in 1993 as a single off his album &quot;A Lot About Livin&#x27; (And a Little &#x27;bout Love)&quot; (the name of the album being the last line of the aforementioned song&#x27;s chorus). &quot;Chattahoochee&quot; received Country Music Association awards for Single of the Year and Song of the Year.

Composer Juan María Solare wrote a piano piece called &quot;Chattahoochee River&quot;, technically a slow blues with a central faster section.

<doc id="273482" wikidata="Q734079" url="?curid=273482" title="Facilitated communication">
<text>Facilitated communication (FC), or supported typing, is a scientifically discredited technique which claims to allow non-verbal people, such as those with autism, to communicate. The technique involves a facilitator guiding the disabled person&#x27;s arm or hand in an attempt to help them type on a keyboard or other such device that they are unable to properly use if unfacilitated.

There is widespread agreement within the scientific community and among disability advocacy organizations that FC is a pseudoscience. Research indicates that the facilitator is the source of the messages obtained through FC, rather than the disabled person. The facilitator may believe they are not the source of the messages due to the ideomotor effect, which is the same effect that guides a Ouija board and dowsing rods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ganz/Katsiyannis/Morin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have consistently found that FC is unable to provide the correct response to even simple questions when the facilitator does not know the answers to the questions (e.g., showing the patient but not the facilitator an object). In addition, in numerous cases disabled persons have been assumed by facilitators to be typing a coherent message while the patient&#x27;s eyes were closed or while they were looking away from or showing no particular interest in the letter board.

Facilitated communication has been called &quot;the single most scientifically discredited intervention in all of developmental disabilities&quot;. Some promoters of the technique have claimed that FC cannot be clearly disproven because a testing environment might cause the subject to lose confidence. However, there is a scientific consensus that facilitated communication is not a valid communication technique, and its use is strongly discouraged by most speech and language disability professional organizations. There have been a large number of false abuse allegations made through facilitated communication.

==Overview==
Facilitated communication is promoted as a means to assist people with severe communication disabilities in pointing to letters on an alphabet board, keyboard or other device so that they can communicate independently. It has also been called &quot;supported typing&quot;, &quot;progressive kinesthetic feedback&quot;, and &quot;written output communication enhancement&quot;. It is related to the Rapid Prompting Method (RPM), also known as &quot;informative pointing&quot;, which also has no evidence of efficacy.

The person with disabilities, who is often unable to rely on speech to communicate, is called the &quot;communication partner&quot;, while the person holding their arm is called the &quot;facilitator&quot;. The facilitator holds or touches the communication partner&#x27;s elbow, wrist, hand, sleeve or other parts of the body while the communication partner points to letters of the alphabet on a keyboard or other device.

One device popular with early FC users was the Canon Communicator, which printed a tape of letters when activated. However, two American companies were later charged by the Federal Trade Commission for making &quot;false and unsubstantiated claims&quot; that the device could enable disabled people to communicate using FC. The companies settled and stopped mentioning FC in their advertising campaigns.

Proponents of FC claim that the reason people with autism cannot communicate effectively involves motor issues such as apraxia, and that they &quot;lack confidence in their abilities&quot; but physical support helps them overcome this limitation. However, this claim is unsubstantiated. Research indicates that non-verbal autistics are unable to communicate due to intellectual disability.

The facilitator is depicted as helping the patient with pointing to letters, controlling involuntary arm movements, avoiding mistakes, initiating movement, verbal prompts, and moral support. It is also claimed that the facilitator must believe in the patient&#x27;s ability to communicate. Former facilitator Janyce Boynton, who came to reject the technique after taking part in double-blind trials, later reported that her training took for granted that the process worked, and that the complexity of facilitation made it hard to realise that messages were coming from her expectations and not from her patients: 

Scott Lilienfeld, the Dobbs Professor of Psychology at Emory University, writing in &quot;The Neuroethics Blog&quot;, admonishes practitioners of mental health practice not to ignore their &quot;&quot;epistemic duties&quot; – responsibilities to seek out and possess accurate knowledge about the world&quot;, and wrote:

Techniques similar to FC appeared around the 1960s, with early observations regarding facilitated teaching of children with autism being published by Else Hansen (Denmark), Lorna Wing (England), and Rosalind Oppenheimer (U.S.). Studies were made in Denmark in the 1960s and 1970s, but did not have an impact outside of the country, and the debate there died out in the early 1980s due to a lack of scientific evidence.

In Australia, special educator Rosemary Crossley independently created facilitated communication in 1977, where it became popular largely due to her efforts. It was popularized in the United States beginning in the late 1980s by Arthur Schawlow and Douglas Biklen. FC has also received attention in Asia and Europe.

Early users of facilitated communication praised it for its apparent simplicity. It was promoted as a &quot;teaching strategy&quot; that did not require objective evaluation or close monitoring. However, as early as 1991, more than 40 peer-reviewed studies had not only failed to demonstrate FC&#x27;s efficacy, but indicated that any successes reported were due to facilitator influence. This influence is usually attributed to non-conscious movements, and it is thought that facilitators are genuinely unaware that they are controlling the communications.

In 1994, the American Psychological Association (APA), passed a resolution cautioning against the use of facilitated communication, citing the lack of scientific evidence. They also stated that information obtained via FC should not be used to confirm or deny allegations of abuse or to make diagnostic or treatment decisions. In recognition of the continued scientific evidence against the technique, this was followed by similar statements from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), and the International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (ISAAC) In 1998, a British government report concluded that &quot;the phenomenon fails to materialise once facilitator effects have been controlled. It would be hard to justify further research on this&quot;. By 2001, it was reported in a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed literature that &quot;Facilitated Communication (FC) had largely been empirically discredited as an effective intervention for previously uncommunicative persons with disabilities, especially those with autism and related disorders. Key empirical findings consistently showed that the facilitator and not the client initiated communication.&quot;

Many people believed FC had passed its peak, characterizing it as a fad and pseudoscientific. However, promotion of the technique continued, with supporters dismissing empirical investigations as irrelevant, flawed, or unnecessary, and calling FC an &quot;effective and legitimate intervention&quot;. As of 2014, the facilitated communication movement remained popular and it continued to be used in many countries. Mostert writes:All the newer pro-FC studies operate from the premise that FC works and is a legitimate practice to be used in investigating any number of other phenomena related to people with autism and other related severe communication problems. Such assumptions increasingly morph FC into a valid intervention among readers who are unaware of the empirical dismissal of the intervention and who might not be skilled in distinguishing solid from suspect research. In this regard, it is likely that FC will continue to reinforce the assumptions of efficacy among parents and practitioners. These perceptions will continue to be reinforced by professional organizations such as the Facilitated Communication Institute at Syracuse University, a fairly wide acceptance of FC internationally, and the vacuum created by few if any future solid empirical studies that are likely to dissuade the faithful.Facilitated communication is closely related to the rapid prompting method (RPM), in which the facilitator holds the letter board instead of touching the patient. Proponents of RPM deny similarities with FC and state that the prompts are &quot;nonspecific&quot;. However, RPM contains subtle cuing that makes it highly susceptible to influence from the facilitator.

Other similarities between RPM and FC include: reluctance or refusal to test their claims in controlled settings (purportedly because the process breaks the trust between facilitator and client), presumed competence, reliance on anecdotal accounts as proof of efficacy, maintenance of practices, techniques and claims that are inconsistent with the known research, claims of extraordinary literacy or intellectual breakthroughs, unconscious verbal or physical cuing by facilitators to obtain the expected responses, and inadequate or non-existent protocols to account for the effects of the facilitator.

In 2019, a dispute about the use of Spelling to Communicate (S2C), a brand of RPM, developed between the Lower Merion School District and the parent of a child attending school there. The parents claimed the child was deprived of a free education because the district declined to pay for a private educational program based on S2C. In December of that year, the hearing officer in the Pennsylvania Office of Dispute Resolution found that there was no evidence that S2C enabled the child to communicate and thus the school district prevailed.

== Organizations supporting and opposing facilitated communication ==

=== Supporters ===
In 2010, &quot;Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Reference Handbook&quot; mentioned the Autism National Committee (AutCom), a parent-led nonprofit, as the main example of an organization that continued promoting facilitated communication, despite research in the mid-1990s which found that facilitators were doing the communicating rather than the children themselves. As of 2022, AutCom continues to state on its website that it &quot;[stands] with autistics, along with their families, friends, and allies, and others who know and respect them, who are working to gain a reliable, autonomous voice&quot;, and lists methods it supports including &quot;Facilitated Communication Training (FCT), Rapid Prompting Method (RPM), Spelling to Communicate (S2C), or Informative Pointing Method&quot;. Other organizations supporting FC have included the Association for Persons with Severe Handicaps (TASH) and the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN).

==Claims and evidence==

There is widespread agreement within the scientific community and multiple disability advocacy organizations that FC is not a valid technique for communicating with those with autism spectrum disorder. Instead, research indicates that the facilitator is the source of the messages obtained through FC (involving ideomotor effect guidance of the arm of the patient by the facilitator). Studies have consistently found that FC is unable to provide the correct response to even simple questions when the facilitator does not know the answers to the questions (e.g., showing the patient but not the facilitator an object).

While video tapes exist that appear to show disabled people communicating through FC, or who have used it as a means to learn independent typing, these videos are widely regarded as inaccurate and misleading. According to one researcher, &quot;You can edit videotape and show whatever you want. They&#x27;ll show you a close-up of the finger moving across the keyboard... but you&#x27;re not getting what else is going on.&quot;

===Authorship of messages===

Researchers attribute the facilitators&#x27; beliefs about authorship to the ideomotor effect (also called the Clever Hans or Ouija effect). While proponents say that FC should never involve guiding the patient, researchers attending an FC class in 1993 observed that physical force was used to prevent the patients from moving their hand away from the keyboard. Facilitators may also influence movements without realizing it. Researcher Gina Green stated: &quot;Very subtle influence can affect people&#x27;s behavior. It doesn&#x27;t even have to be touch. It can be the slightest sound, the slightest visual cue.&quot; Guidelines for facilitators instruct practitioners to expect the emergence of hidden skills and sensitive personal information, to use anecdotal data to validate authorship, to avoid objective scrutiny.

Some observers have reported that while the facilitators were watching the letter board, their communication partners were often distracted, staring off into space, rolling around on the floor, falling asleep, or otherwise not paying attention. In other cases, the communication partners spoke words that conflicted with the words being typed. Individuals described as highly competent would also give wrong answers to simple questions or information that they should have readily known (e.g. the name of the family dog, the names of family members, the spelling of their own name) but which facilitators did not.

Proponents of the technique believed that patients who had not been taught reading, writing or mathematics were capable of writing down complex thoughts and solving multiplication problems. Patients have also been claimed to write books and poetry, advocate for better treatment of people with disabilities, express a desire to get married, have sexual relations, decide important medical issues, and, in some cases, report abuses allegedly occurring in their homes. According to psychologist Adrienne Perry, &quot;The adult or child with autism is made a &#x27;screen&#x27; for a facilitator&#x27;s hostilities, hopes, beliefs or suspicions&quot;.

===Autism===

While proponents of FC claim that autism is primarily a motor control problem that can be overcome with physical support, this view is not accepted by the scientific community. Autism is often accompanied by intellectual disabilities affecting language and communication which cannot be overcome by supportively holding someone&#x27;s hand. Facilitators reject objective data and use public opinion and qualitative studies to promote FC&#x27;s efficacy despite contradicting a long history of autism research. In some cases, patients learn to give specific responses to cues from the facilitator, such as in cases where the facilitator only touches their shoulder or does not touch the patient at all. Proponents also say that a few individuals using FC have developed the ability to type independently or with minimal support, but these claims are anecdotal and have not been substantiated. Many facilitators deny they are influencing their communication partners&#x27; movements, even when faced with evidence to the contrary.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical report, &quot;Identification, Evaluation, and Management of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder&quot;, published in January, 2020, the &quot;Current scientific evidence does not support the use of facilitated communication in which a nonverbal individual is guided to communicate. This differs from augmentative and alternative communication, in which the individual is taught to communicate independently.&quot;

Belief in facilitated communication is promoted by its status as a claimed &quot;miracle cure&quot; presented when parents are undergoing stress and grief from learning that their child has a disability. The only evidence of success is the transcript of apparent communication. In some cases of autism, parents reject the diagnosis and say that their child&#x27;s disability is physical rather than developmental, and with FC or RPM their beliefs are confirmed. Researchers James Mulick, John Jacobson and Frank Kobe state that FC is used to &quot;...stroke their hopes with empty promises, regardless of their sincerity, while reaping personal or political rewards and working hard to prevent systematic verification of their claims&quot;. They add that &quot;people with handicaps can be valued members of their families and communities without resorting to appeals to miracle cures&quot; and that genuine help is available, but &quot;advances in treatment and understanding come at the price of rigorous training, dedication to accuracy and scientific standards, and objective verification of all treatment claims&quot;.

Bernard Rimland, a research psychologist who founded the Autism Research Institute of San Diego and the Autism Society of America, asked &quot;How is it possible that an autistic kid can pick up the last tiny crumbs of potato chips off a plate but not have sufficient motor coordination to type the letter E?&quot; Howard Shane, director of the Center for Communication Enhancement at Children&#x27;s Hospital in Boston and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, finds it &quot;curious that those being facilitated can only create [these] insightful comments&quot; when helped by an assistant. Why, when technology allowed people with severe disabilities the opportunity to access independent communication with even the slightest movement (e.g., an eye wink, movement of an eyebrow, a puff of air into a straw), would a facilitator need to hold their hand?

Testifying in the Anna Stubblefield court case, psychology professor James Todd called facilitated communication &quot;the single most scientifically discredited intervention in all of developmental disabilities&quot; and that every methodologically sound study of FC has shown it to be invalid. Writing about that case in the journal &quot;Disability and Society&quot;, Mark Sherry voiced similar concerns about FC&#x27;s lack of scientific validity, calling it a &quot;sham&quot;, &quot;hoax&quot; and a &quot;fraud.&quot; Sherry&#x27;s was the first article published in a Disability Studies journal which thoroughly critiqued Stubblefield&#x27;s actions, a noteworthy contribution because Stubblefield had also been in Disability Studies and had previously published about FC in the journal &quot;Disability Studies Quarterly&quot;. Sherry suggested that some of the defenders of Stubblefield (and FC more broadly) are either her personal friends or work in institutions which receive substantial income from providing FC. A newspaper editorial from Syracuse University, where the techniques relevant to the case had been taught, called it &quot;inexcusable&quot; and &quot;embarrassing&quot; that the university continues to support FC after over 25 years of research has discredited it.

===Opposition to research===

Members of the FC movement rely on anecdotal and observational data (e.g., the existence of unique spellings or unexpected skills or revelations made during the communication session) in order to back up their claims. However, because cueing is often subtle and it is not always possible to observe the influence of the facilitator, informal observations and facilitator reports have proven unreliable in determining authorship.

Parents and researchers who questioned FC&#x27;s effectiveness and supported evaluating FC by objective methods have been accused of being &quot;oppressors of the disabled&quot;, told they were narrow-minded, outmoded, evil, jealous they were not the ones to discover FC, and, in some cases, accused of hate speech for advocating a more studied approach. Proponents claim that testing is demeaning to the disabled person, that the testing environment creates performance anxiety, or that those being facilitated may purposely produce nonsense, refuse to respond, or give wrong answers to counteract the negative attitudes of those who are skeptical of the technique.

Mostert wrote in 2001, &quot;FC proponents must be encouraged to subject their claims to further scientific verification, the claims of anecdotal evidence notwithstanding. If any small part of FC is ever to be found effective or even plausible, it is abundantly clear that only by careful use of controlled experimental methods will this be established.&quot; The only way to determine whether communications are truly independent is to perform controlled testing, where the facilitator does not already know the answers to questions and, therefore, cannot inadvertently or purposefully cue their communication partner to obtain the desired answer. Even if the facilitator feels like they are not moving the other person&#x27;s hand, they can still be providing cues that lead to specific letters on the keyboard.

In 1992, when FC was fairly new to the United States, Douglas Biklen was quoted in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as saying he &quot;welcomed scientific studies&quot;, but the article went on to say: he doesn&#x27;t want to do them. He&#x27;s an educator, not a psychiatrist, and like other educators who have written about facilitated communication, he is comfortable with the fact that there is often a lag time between the application of a new method and its scientific validation. Although proponents say that FC is difficult or impossible to objectively test, psychologist James T. Todd wrote: the determination of authorship in FC involves a straightforward application of basic experimental methods described comprehensively by Mill (1843) more than a century and half ago, but understood for millennia. We are not speaking of obscure or controversial techniques. We are speaking of authorship validation by selectively presenting different information to two people then observing what is produced.

===Blind testing===
Despite the FC community&#x27;s reluctance to participate in testing, researchers outside the community set up blinded experiments to identify who was doing the communicating. Some of the tests were conducted as a direct response to cases involving sexual abuse allegations made through facilitated communication against parents, teachers, and caregivers of people with disabilities. However, a number of controlled evaluations were also conducted by clinicians, researchers, and program administrators who were considering the use of FC, but wanted an objective, empirical basis for deciding what role, if any, FC would have in their programs.

The O.D. Heck Center in Schenectady, New York was one of the first in the United States to go public with their findings, which were that their clients produced meaningful responses through facilitated communication only when their facilitators had access to the correct responses. The report also ruled out issues of confidence or skepticism on the part of the evaluators. All twelve participants (people with disabilities) were chosen for the evaluation because their facilitators believed in their ability to communicate through FC. The study demonstrated that the communication partners were &quot;systematically and unknowingly&quot; being influenced by their facilitators. The researchers wrote:In fact, the nature of the findings permits us to assert that their output in facilitated communication was not only influenced, but was controlled and determined by the facilitators. To all appearances, these participants had been producing thoughtful communication, and several had consistently engaged in interactive conversations using facilitated communication. Many people serving these individuals believed that this output reflected the valid expressions of the participants.The result of the O.D. Heck study seemed so startling, especially in light of the positive response FC was getting in the popular press, that &quot;Frontline&quot; featured the story in its 1993 &quot;Prisoners of Silence&quot;. In 1993, Genae A. Hall, research director for the Behavior Analysis Center for Autism, wrote: The fact that facilitators often control and direct the typing has been called &quot;facilitator influence,&quot; which seems to be a misnomer. &quot;Facilitator influence&quot; suggests that the disabled person is emitting verbal behavior, and the facilitator is exerting partial control (or &quot;influence&quot;) over that behavior. Although partial control certainly may occur when fading prompts within structured teaching programs, such control has not been demonstrated in most cases of FC. Rather than influencing the typed messages, the facilitator appears to be the sole author of those messages. Thus, the focus of analysis is shifted from the disabled person&#x27;s behavior to the facilitator&#x27;s behavior. Multiple other double-blind studies were being conducted at the same time, and whenever conditions were adequately controlled to prevent the facilitator from knowing the answers to questions, the results revealed facilitator influence, if not direct authorship.

In 1994, Thistledown Regional Centre in Ontario, Canada conducted an internal study of 20 people with autism and stopped using FC when the results showed facilitator influence was &quot;contaminating the messages being produced.&quot; By 1995, these results had been replicated by researchers worldwide in at least 24 studies in credible, peer-reviewed research journals using multiple different methods that ensure the facilitator does not know or cannot guess the expected message, or does not look at the letters.

In 1997, reflecting on the trajectory FC has taken in several countries, including Denmark, the U.S. and Australia, von Tetzchner wrote:In the struggle to keep up to date with an increasing number of published papers, both researchers and practitioners tend to forget history. In order to avoid making the same mistakes over again, the issues and processes underlying the rise and fall of facilitating techniques--as well as other intervention methods--in various countries should have a natural place in research reviews. When an intervention claimed to have exceptional effects disappears, the likely reason is lack of positive results.By 2005, more than 50 controlled studies and blind tests had been conducted, in addition to numerous controlled tests conducted in legal cases. The studies consistently showed &quot;without a doubt&quot; that the messages obtained through facilitated communication were controlled by the facilitators and not their communication partners.

The vast majority of evidence now indicates that facilitated communication is not scientifically valid. However, this information has not stopped many individuals from using this technique under various circumstances and furthermore, advocating for its effectiveness. The overwhelming majority of studies conducted on the efficacy of this technique has revealed that any &quot;positive&quot; results indicating that facilitated communication has worked can be attributed to the facilitators themselves. Be it the facilitator attributing their own beliefs and views onto the individual, or creating a pseudo-personality for the disabled individual based on their previous encounters with them, it is clear that the facilitator is really the one doing all the communicating.

The American Psychological Association (APA) issued a statement in 1994 that there was &quot;no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy.&quot; Finally, even further defining facilitated communication as a pseudoscience, the APA issued a statement indicating that facilitated communication studies have repeatedly demonstrated that it is not a scientifically valid technique and that it is a controversial and unproved communicative procedure with no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy.

==Previous proponents==

Pat Mirenda, a professor in the Department of Educational and Counseling Psychology and Special Education at the University of British Columbia, and co-author David R. Beukelman, Barkley Professor of Communication Disorders at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, had included FC in early versions of their textbook &quot;Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Supporting Children and Adults with Complex Communication Needs.&quot; These versions are quoted in pro-FC literature. However, they decided not to include FC in revised versions, and in 2015 Mirenda stated that she, &quot;came to recognize (painfully, to be honest) that my advocacy stance biased me to interpret what I saw on videotapes as independent typing even though other explanations were more plausible (e.g., subtle prompting, resulting in an ideomotor effect), and that, even if independent typing did occur subsequent to FC exposure, only correlational—but definitely not causal—evidence exists with regard to its relationship to FC. In short, I do not endorse FC as a communication or instructional technique, and I do not support its use.&quot;

Stephen N. Calculator of the University of New Hampshire, an early proponent of FC, later distanced himself from the movement because he could not replicate claims of independent communication in his own research studies. He described the importance of determining the extent of facilitator influence: &quot;The consequences of falsely attributing messages to communicators, rather than facilitators, continue to have significant financial, social and moral ramifications. Facilitators must take extraordinary precautions to assure that they are not unduly influencing messages and thereby impinging on communicators&#x27; freedom of speech. The rights of individuals to express their thoughts and ideas should not be circumvented by facilitators who communicate for them, unwilling or not.&quot;

Janyce Boynton, who at one time was a strong FC proponent, is now one of FC&#x27;s leading critics. In the early 1990s, she was the facilitator for a non-speaking high school girl with autism who seemed to describe having been sexually abused by her parents, resulting in the girl and her brother being removed from their home. However, systematic testing by Howard Shane revealed that the girl could not have been the author of the messages. The case was described in the 1993 PBS &quot;Frontline&quot; documentary &quot;Prisoners of Silence&quot;. Unlike many in the FC-proponent community, Boynton accepted the evidence from Shane&#x27;s testing and other well-controlled scientific studies. She stopped using FC, convinced her school administration to implement a system-wide prohibition on its use, and apologized to the falsely accused parents of the girl she had worked with. In a presentation at the CSICON meetings in 2019, Boynton argued that most FC facilitators are well-meaning but are caught up in a belief system that leads them to discount the overwhelming evidence that FC does not work. She maintains a clearinghouse of professional articles and media coverage about FC, and helped in convincing the University of Northern Iowa to stop sponsoring an annual workshop that included instruction in FC. As stated by another member of that group (Stuart Vyse), &quot;this is just the beginning. There are a number of other universities and governmental organizations that tacitly or explicitly endorse FC and/or its related techniques, and Ms. Boynton and her allies have their eyes on a number of these future targets&quot;.

In 2006, Belgian neurologist Steven Laureys claimed that Rom Houben, a comatose man, was able to type out thoughts on a keypad with the help of facilitated communications. However, when independent tests demonstrated that FC could not produce the correct answers to questions if the facilitator had not been in the room, he agreed that Houben had not been communicating.

== Presentation in the media ==
Stories of purported successes are still reported in magazines such as &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, in movies and plays, and on television shows such as ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; Prime Time Live with Diane Sawyer. Thousands of people—teachers, parents, speech pathologists, psychologists—struggling to find a way to communicate with individuals who, otherwise, demonstrated little ability to use words to communicate—adopted FC with &quot;blinding speed&quot; with little public scrutiny or debate. Eric Schopler, then director of an autism education program at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and editor of the Journal of Autism, described promoting facilitated communication with no empirical evidence as &quot;reckless&quot;.

Describing this rapid rise in popularity, particularly in the United States, doctors John W. Jacobson, James A. Mulick, and Allen A. Schwartz wrote: The general acceptance of FC by the public and segments of the professional community has called into question the rigor with which educational and therapeutic interventions are evaluated in publicly funded programs and the ability of many professionals to critically assess the procedures they use. As such, FC serves as a case study in how the public and, alarmingly, some professionals, fail to recognize the role of science in distinguishing truth from falsity and its applicability to assessing the value of treatment modalities.James Randi, a magician familiar with the ideomotor effect commonly attributed to dowsing and later linked to FC, was called in to investigate facilitated communication at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1992, and later called it &quot;a crock that does more harm than good by raising false hopes among families of autistic children&quot;. The James Randi Educational Foundation has offered a million-dollar prize &quot;to a valid demonstration of facilitated communication.&quot; In 2009, Randi responded in an interview for the Rom Houben case, where it was shown that messages from a Belgian man who was believed to be in a coma for 23 years were generated by the facilitator, &quot;Our prize is still there.&quot;

==Institutional support==

===Syracuse University===
In 1992, Syracuse University founded the Facilitated Communication Institute to promote the use of FC. Douglas Biklen was appointed as the institute&#x27;s first director. In 2010, the name was changed to the Institute on Communication and Inclusion (ICI). It is part of the Center on Disability and Inclusion of the School of Education. According to the ICI website, the Institute &quot;... is an active research, training, and support center, and the nation’s leading resource for information about communication and inclusion for individuals who type to communicate.&quot; The Institute carries out training and research in FC and publishes scholarly articles, books, and films.

===University of Northern Iowa===
From 2014 through 2018, the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) held the Midwest Summer Institute that focused on &quot;inclusive schools, employment and daily living, as well as communication and supported or facilitated typing for people with autism spectrum disabilit[ies] and other complex communication needs.&quot; In 2018, following the release of a statement from scientists and academics arguing FC had long been discredited and calling it an &quot;invalidated and demonstrably harmful practice&quot;, UNI announced it would stop supporting the conference.

==Abuse allegations and facilitator misconduct==
There have been instances in which facilitated communication produces allegations of sexual or physical abuse. Often, the alleged abuse is sexual and contains &quot;extensive, explicit, pornographic details.&quot; It is not known whether FC generates more abuse allegations than other suggestive techniques.

Researchers suspect that facilitators involved in this type of case may, mistakenly, believe there is a link between early abuse and autism, or suspect familial abuse for other reasons. As Green wrote in a 1995 article:suggestions about sexual abuse permeate the culture. Just watch Oprah or Phil [Donahue] almost any time or scan the pop psychology section at your local bookstore. Couple that with mandatory abuse reporting laws, mix in a little bit of crusading zeal to &quot;save&quot; people with disabilities from mistreatment, and you have a potent set of antecedents for facilitators to produce allegations.In 1993, &quot;Frontline&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Prisoners of Silence&quot; featured the story of Gerry Gherardi of North Carolina who was accused, through FC-generated messages, of sexually abusing his son. Despite protestations of innocence, Gherardi was forced to stay away from his home for six months. The charges were dropped when court-ordered double-blind tests showed that Gherardi&#x27;s son could not write. In the same year, Rimland reported in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article that he knew of about 25 cases where families were accused through facilitated communication of sexually abusing their children.

By 1995, there were 60 known cases, with many others settled without reaching public visibility. Since then, the number of cases continues to increase. In addition to accusations of sexual abuse, facilitators have reportedly fallen in love with their communication partners and, relying on FC for consent, initiated sexual, physical contact with people in their care, raising serious ethical and legal problems.

=== Anna Stubblefield ===
In 2015, Anna Stubblefield, a Rutgers University–Newark philosophy professor, was found guilty of aggravated sexual assault against a man with severe mental disabilities. A proponent of facilitated communication, Stubblefield&#x27;s web site described her as &quot;certified as a Facilitated Communication Trainer by the FC Institute at the School of Education, Syracuse University. She provides motor planning support for communication and literacy for adults and children.&quot; At the time the investigation began in 2011, Stubblefield was the chair of Rutgers-Newark&#x27;s philosophy department, whose professional work centered on ethics, race, and disability rights, but she was subsequently put on administrative leave without pay and removed as chair of the philosophy department.

The victim was identified as D.J., a 33-year-old African-American man with severe mental disabilities who cannot speak, has cerebral palsy, and is unable to stand independently or accurately direct movements of his body. Based on his disability, his mother and brother were appointed his legal guardians. Stubblefield stated that she had successfully communicated with him, determining he was of normal intelligence. She subsequently brought him to conferences where she &quot;held him out as a success story&quot;. In 2011, she revealed to his mother and brother that she had had sexual relations with D.J. and said that they were in love, attributing consent to messages received while facilitating. Stubblefield stated that the two of them had a mutually consenting relationship established through facilitated communication. However, testing of D.J. by family members failed to establish the ability to communicate, and Stubblefield was thanked but denied further access to D.J. She continued to attempt to maintain contact with D.J. and began challenging control of D.J.&#x27;s legal guardians over him. In August 2011, the family contacted the police.

Stubblefield pleaded not guilty to the charges and said that FC revealed D.J. was mentally capable, while prosecutors said that FC was scientifically discredited and that D.J. did not have the ability to consent to sexual relations. Experts evaluating D.J. testified he did not have the intellectual ability to consent to sexual activity. Facilitated communication testimony from D.J. was not allowed as the technique was ruled unreliable under New Jersey law. After a three-week trial, the jury found Stubblefield guilty of two counts of first-degree aggravated sexual assault. After conviction, the judge revoked bail, saying that she was a flight risk, and she was sentenced to 12 years in prison. This included requiring her to register as a sex offender. In July 2017, an appeals court overturned her conviction and ordered a retrial, and in 2018 she pleaded guilty to &quot;third-degree aggravated criminal sexual contact&quot; and was sentenced to time served. In October 2016, the family was awarded $4 million in a civil lawsuit against Stubblefield.

The 2023 documentary film &quot;Tell Them You Love Me&quot; by Louis Theroux covers the story.

=== Martina Susanne Schweiger case ===
In 2014, Martina Susanne Schweiger of Queensland, Australia, received an 18-month suspended jail sentence for two counts of indecent dealing with a 21-year-old client with severe autism with whom she worked at a disability services home. The client required 24-hour support and was not able to speak, write or use manual sign-language.

Schweiger believed the client expressed love for her through FC, which she claimed to reciprocate. She also believed the client, again through FC, indicated a desire to have sex. On one occasion, Schweiger removed her clothes in front of her client. On another, she &quot;play wrestled&quot; with him, touching his penis with her hands and mouth. She confessed her actions to her employer. After hearing reports from Alan Hudson, psychology professor at RMIT University, that FC &quot;did not work for the young man&quot;, Judge Gary Long of Maroochydore District Court found Schweiger guilty of the charges, indicating that FC was neither reliable nor accurate as a method of communication.

<text>The Apalachicola–Chattahoochee–Flint River Basin (the ACF River Basin) is the drainage basin, or watershed, of the Apalachicola River, Chattahoochee River, and Flint River, in the Southeastern United States.

This area is alternatively known as simply the Apalachicola Basin and is listed by the United States Geological Survey as basin HUC 031300, as well as sub-region HUC 0313. It is located in the South Atlantic-Gulf Water Resource Region, which is listed as HUC 03. The basin is further sub-divided into 14 sub-basins.

==Geography==
The ACF River Basin begins in the mountains of northeast Georgia, and drains much of metro Atlanta, most of west Georgia and southwest Georgia and adjoining counties of southeast Alabama, before it splits the central part of the Florida Panhandle and flows into the Gulf of Mexico at Apalachicola Bay, near Apalachicola, Florida. It drains an area of 20,355 square miles. Most of the northern half of the basin abuts the Eastern Continental Divide on the east, and the ACT River Basin to the west.

==Listing of Water Resource Sub-Basins==
==Water wars==
These states and Alabama have been involved in a water-use dispute for two decades, known as the Tri-state water dispute. Georgia has also lobbied the United States Congress to end navigation on the Appalachicola and lower Chattahoochee, to conserve more water during droughts. Keeping the two rivers at a navigable depth during these times requires large releases from dams upstream, sending potential drinking water downstream for shipping, and often dropping lakes to levels dangerous to boaters.

===Conservation===
Other ecological conservation and economic concerns include protecting harvests of oysters in Apalachicola Bay, which require a large enough flow of fresh water to prevent excessive saltwater intrusion from the Gulf. Numerous endangered and imperiled species occur in the basin, including many endemic mussels 

The cost of dredging silt, much of it caused by uncontrolled growth across metro Atlanta&#x27;s fine red clay soil, has also been criticized as a wasteful exercise to float so little ship traffic.
