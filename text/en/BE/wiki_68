<text>George Adams (c. 1709–1773) was an English instrument maker and science writer. His son George Adams, who carried on the business, was also known as an instrument maker and optician.

==Life==
He was the eldest surviving son of Morris Adams, a cook, and his wife Mary, and was baptized in 1709. He was an apprentice to instrument makers, James Parker who died, and then Thomas Heath. He went into business in 1734, in Fleet Street, London.

==Bibliography==
Adams was best known for &quot;A Treatise Describing the Construction and Explaining the Use of New Celestial and Terrestrial Globes&quot; (London: 1766). There were later editions, but the claim of 30 up to 1810 is not now accepted. Other works were:

*&quot;Micrographia Illustrata, or the knowledge of the microscope explained&quot; (1746), which included &quot;a translation of Mr. Joblott&#x27;s observations on animalculæ&quot;, and had four editions to 1771. Henry Baker attacked this book, on grounds of plagiarism.
*&quot;The Description and Use of a new Sea-quadrant for taking the altitude of the sun from the visible horizon&quot; (1748). 
*&quot;The Description and Use of the Universal Trigonometrical Octant was invented and applied to Hadley&#x27;s Quadrant&quot; (1753).

<text>Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiary (; 22 June 1932 – 25 October 2001) was Queen of Iran as the second wife of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, whom she married in 1951. Their marriage suffered many pressures, particularly when it became clear that she was infertile. She rejected the Shah&#x27;s suggestion that he might take a second wife in order to produce an heir, as he rejected her suggestion that he might abdicate in favor of his half-brother. In March 1958, their divorce was announced. After a brief career as an actress, and a liaison with Italian film director Franco Indovina, Soraya lived alone in Paris until her death.

==Early life and education==

Soraya was the elder child and only daughter of Khalil Esfandiary-Bakhtiary (1901–1983), a Bakhtiari nobleman and Iranian ambassador to West Germany in the 1950s, and his Russian-born German wife Eva Karl (1906–1994).

She was born in the English Missionary Hospital in Isfahan on 22 June 1932. She had one sibling, a younger brother, Bijan (1937–2001). Her family had long been involved in the Iranian government and diplomatic corps. An uncle of her father, Sardar Assad, was a leader in the Persian Constitutional Revolution of the early 20th century. Soraya was raised in Berlin and Isfahan, and educated in London and Switzerland.

==Marriage==
In 1948, Soraya was introduced to the recently divorced Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, by Forough Zafar Bakhtiari, a close relative of Soraya&#x27;s, via a photograph taken by Goodarz Bakhtiary, in London, per Forough Zafar&#x27;s request. At the time Soraya had completed high school at a Swiss finishing school and was studying the English language in London. They were soon engaged: the Shah gave her a 22.37 carat (4.474 g) diamond engagement ring.

Soraya married the Shah at Marble Palace, Tehran, on 12 February 1951. Originally the couple had planned to wed on 27 December 1950, but the ceremony was postponed due to the bride being ill.

Although the Shah announced that guests should donate money to a special charity for the Iranian poor, among the wedding gifts were a mink coat and a desk set with black diamonds sent by Joseph Stalin; a Steuben glass &quot;Bowl of Legends&quot; designed by Sidney Waugh and sent by President of the United States, Harry S. Truman and Mrs. Truman; and silver Georgian candlesticks from King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. The 2,000 guests included Aga Khan III.

The ceremony was decorated with 1.5 tonnes of orchids, tulips and carnations, sent by plane from the Netherlands. Entertainment included an equestrian circus from Rome. The bride wore a silver lamé gown studded with pearls and trimmed with marabou stork feathers, designed for the occasion by Christian Dior. Of all the Shah&#x27;s many women, it is generally believed that Soraya was the &quot;true love&quot; of his life as she was the one he loved the most.

Soraya later wrote about herself and Iran: &quot;I was a dunce. I knew next to nothing of the geography, the legends of my country; nothing of its history, nothing of the Muslim religion&quot;. Soraya&#x27;s upbringing had been entirely German and Catholic, which left her with a mixed identity, and made her the object of much distrust in Iran with Muslim clerics saying the Shah should not marry this &quot;half-European girl&quot; who was not raised a Muslim. Soraya wrote: &quot;The feeling of being both Christian and Muslim, but at the same time of being neither one nor the other has engraved in my flesh two divergent poles between which my existence has unfolded. The one is &quot;methodically&quot; European, the other &quot;savagely&quot; Persian&quot;.

==Queen of Iran==
Following the marriage, Soraya headed the family charity in Iran. Soraya&#x27;s marriage was troubled as Mohammad Reza&#x27;s mother and sisters all saw her as a rival for his love just as they had with his first wife Princess Fawzia of Egypt, and continually snubbed and inflicted petty humiliations on her. Soraya hated Ernest Perron, the Shah&#x27;s best friend and private secretary. Soraya called Perron a &quot;homosexual who detested women, all women&quot; and who &quot;spread poison around the palace as well as our own quarters&quot;. She wrote that Perron was a &quot;cunning, perfidious and Machiavellian&quot; man who &quot;roused hatred, stirred gossip, reveled in every intrigue&quot;. Much to her disgust, Mohammad Reza was &quot;fascinated with this diabolical Swiss&quot; who professed to be a &quot;philosopher, poet, and a prophet&quot;; the two men met every morning to discuss all the affairs of state in French as Perron was the man whose advice the Shah valued the most, and, as Soraya soon learned, other matters were discussed as well. Much to her revulsion, Perron visited her and made a series of what she called very &quot;lewd&quot; remarks and vulgar questions about her sex life with the Shah, which led her to throw him out of the Marble Palace in her fury.

During the confrontation with Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh of the left-wing National Front, Mohammad Reza was often depressed, being in her words &quot;somber and distressed&quot; to the extent he even stopped playing poker with his friends, which had been one of his main passions. She stated that only sex could lift Mohammad Reza out of his depression, and she often invited the Shah into her bed to keep his spirits up. Several times, Soraya advised Mohammad Reza &quot;to screw up his courage to the sticking point&quot;.

In August 1953, Soraya followed the Shah when he fled to Rome, and complained the Iranian ambassador to Italy failed to arrange for a place for them to stay while the royal couple were constantly harassed by the paparazzi. On 19 August 1953, Soraya remembered how a glum Mohammad Reza was talking about moving to the United States when he received a telegram announcing that Mosaddegh had been overthrown, leading him to shout with joy.
After the 1953 coup overthrew Mosaddegh, the Shah&#x27;s spirits picked up. One of Mohammad Reza and Soraya&#x27;s favorite activities was masked balls, although Soraya complained the Shah always wore a lion costume (the symbol of royalty) while her attempts to appear as Madame de Pompadour were vetoed under grounds this was inappropriate for a queen, and she was forced to appear as Joan of Arc instead. Soraya always praised her husband when he displayed &quot;European&quot; personality traits while criticizing him for &quot;Oriental&quot; behavior. Soraya wrote despite his first marriage and &quot;in spite of countless mistresses he had before me, Mohammad Reza was extremely shy with women . . . he did not like to show his feelings&quot; while praising his eyes as &quot;expressive. Dark brown, almost black, shining, at times hard, at times sad or gentle, they exuded charm and reflected his soul&quot;.

As Soraya was brought up in Europe, Iran was a &quot;strange&quot; country to her, which the Iranian-American historian Abbas Milani argued explained her attitudes towards ordinary Iranians, which he called borderline racist. Europe was always the model for excellence in everything for her. Soraya described as Queen having to visit &quot;hospitals, orphanages, charities, the people&#x27;s quarters with their &quot;djoubs&quot; open to the sky, with streams of dirt water which supplied their dwellings, having first served washerwomen, tramps and dogs. Poverty and squalor. Children with rickets, ravaged women and starving old men, the filth of the alleyways where the houses are no longer houses, where poverty, real poverty prevailed&quot;.

In contrast to the emphasis on the &quot;filth&quot; of Tehran, Soraya wrote with open admiration about how Paris &quot;dazzled&quot; her. Soraya described her time in Paris as &quot;every day my heart was filled with sunshine. Life was light... it was wonderful to be able to go to the cinemas, to drink a glass of lemonade on the terrace of the &quot;brassie&quot;... a pleasure forbade.&quot; Soraya wrote about her joy at attending school in Europe, unlike the Iranian schools with &quot;the grey uniform, the stove which smoked and polluted the classroom, lessons, homework, work to the point of exhaustion&quot;.
In October 1954, Mohammad Reza told Soraya he was concerned about the fact that she had not given him an heir and suggested that they visit the United States to seek the help of American fertility doctors. In 1954-55, the Imperial couple paid a lengthy visit to the United States, leaving on 5 December 1954. In New York, Soraya visited doctors who assured her that an inability to bear a child was due to the &quot;shocks, upsets and vexations of the last two years&quot;, which reassured her, but in Boston, the doctors told her she was infertile and could never have children. Much of the length of their trip was due to the Shah&#x27;s efforts to do something to console Soraya who took the news that she was infertile very badly. Unaware of what the doctors had revealed to Soraya, &quot;Newsweek&quot; sarcastically wrote &quot;even the &quot;Shahanshah&quot; (King of Kings), Vice Regent of God, Shadow of the Almighty and Center of the Universe deserves a vacation...They [the imperial couple] have spent this winter in a private visit to the U.S...physical check-ups in New York hospitals, sight-seeing in San Francisco, dancing the mambo in Hollywood, skiing in Sun Valley, water-skiing in Miami Beach&quot;.

Soraya was fascinated with Hollywood and enjoyed meeting American film stars during her stay in Los Angeles. During her time in Los Angeles, Soraya met her favorite stars who were Grace Kelly, Lauren Bacall, Bob Hope, Esther Williams, and Humphrey Bogart. A photograph of Queen Soraya water-skiing in Miami while wearing a bikini became extremely controversial in Iran. Soraya was widely condemned for the immorality of wearing her swimsuit, which was not considered a proper dress for a Muslim, and the photo was banned in Iran in an attempt to silence the criticism of the &quot;ulema&quot;.

On 12 February 1955, the imperial couple left the United States for the United Kingdom on the famous liner, the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. In London, Mohammad Reza and Soraya had dinner at Buckingham Palace with Queen Elizabeth II; Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; the Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill and the Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden. In the final part of their trip, the imperial couple visited Cologne where they stayed with Soraya&#x27;s parents. The Shah&#x27;s daughter by his first marriage, Princess Shahnaz, who was studying in Belgium, also went to Cologne to see her father, which caused a jealous Soraya to throw what was called an &quot;embarrassing tantrum&quot;, demanding that her husband show love only to her, which finally led to the Shah to tell her to shut up. On 12 March 1955, the Shah and the Queen returned to Tehran, where they were pleased that, despite the fact it was raining, thousands of people had come out to welcome them back. The Shah, who disliked his prime minister, General Fazlollah Zahedi, was well pleased that Zahedi who was suffering from gout was visibly uncomfortable standing out in the rain to welcome him back at the Tehran airport.

Later in 1955, the Shah resumed the persecution of the Baháʼí Faith minority, razing their temples. The British diplomat Denis Wright protested to the Shah&#x27;s minister Asadollah Alam, only to be told that Mohammad Reza had to do something to appease the &quot;ulema&quot; after the photograph of Soraya in a bikini appeared, which had enraged Ayatollah Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi, a key ally of the Shah.

==Divorce==
Though the wedding took place during a heavy snow, deemed a good omen, the imperial couple&#x27;s marriage had disintegrated by early 1958 owing to Soraya&#x27;s apparent infertility. The Shah&#x27;s only child, his daughter Princess Shahnaz, had married Ardeshir Zahedi, the son of the former Prime Minister, General Fazlollah Zahedi, whom Mohammad Reza despised and had dismissed in 1955. The Shah told Soraya that &quot;a Zahedi could not continue the dynasty of the Pahlavis&quot;, and that she had to give him a son so the House of Pahlavi could continue. She had sought treatment in Switzerland and France, and in St. Louis with Dr. William Masters. The Shah suggested that he take a second wife to produce an heir, but she rejected that option.

In an attempt to save her position as Queen, Soraya told the Shah that he should change the constitution of 1909 to allow one of his half-brothers to succeed him, which Mohammad Reza told her would require &quot;the approval of the Council of the Wise Men&quot; first. Soraya, who had never read the constitution, did not know that there was no &quot;Council of Wise Men&quot;, which was the Shah&#x27;s way of putting off a difficult decision by lying. Mohammad Reza had already amended the constitution twice, so he must have known there was no clause calling for a &quot;Council of Wise Men&quot; to approve amendments. The Shah&#x27;s domineering mother hated Soraya and was pressuring him to divorce her, telling him it was his duty to father a son to continue the House of Pahlavi. Mohammad Reza persuaded Soraya to leave Iran while he promised he would call the &quot;Council of Wise Men&quot; to change the constitution. Despite this promise, Soraya sensed her husband had turned against her, and before she left Iran one courtier remembered she had &quot;systematically put her house in order&quot;.

She left Iran in February and eventually went to her parents&#x27; home in Cologne, Germany, where the Shah sent his wife&#x27;s uncle, Senator Sardar Assad in early March 1958, in a failed attempt to convince her to return to Iran. Soraya rejected the offer that she remain queen while the Shah would take a second wife, writing in her memoirs that Mohammad Reza was &quot;fundamentally an Oriental&quot;, drawing an unfavorable contrast with the Duke of Windsor &quot;who sacrificed his throne for love&quot;, writing that only &quot;Orientals&quot; sacrificed love for their thrones. On 5 March, Mohammad Reza phoned her to tell her she would have to accept him taking a second wife or else he would divorce her. On 10 March, a council of advisers met with the Shah to discuss the situation of the troubled marriage and the lack of an heir. Four days later, it was announced that the imperial couple would divorce.

In a press statement issued by the Iranian government, it was announced that Soraya had agreed to the divorce while Soraya later claimed she had last heard from her husband on 5 March and she had not been informed beforehand. It was, the 25-year-old queen said, &quot;a sacrifice of my own happiness&quot;. She later told reporters that her husband had no choice but to divorce her. The British Ambassador to Iran reported &quot;Soraya was the Shah&#x27;s only true love&quot; and he was &quot;a man at an emotional cross-roads&quot;, who was happy to be able to marry again while unable to &quot;bring himself to face it&quot; that he had just divorced Soraya.
On 21 March 1958, the Nowruz, a weeping Shah announced his divorce to the Iranian people in a speech that was broadcast on radio and television; he said that he would not remarry in haste. The headline-making divorce inspired French writer Françoise Mallet-Joris to write a hit pop song, &quot;Je veux pleurer comme Soraya&quot; (&quot;I Want to Cry Like Soraya&quot;). The marriage officially ended on 6 April 1958. According to a report in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, extensive negotiations had preceded the divorce in order to convince Queen Soraya to allow her husband to take a second wife. The Queen, however, citing what she called the sanctity of marriage, decided that &quot;she could not accept the idea of sharing her husband&#x27;s love with another woman.&quot;

In a statement issued to the Iranian people from her parents&#x27; home in Germany, Soraya said, &quot;Since His Imperial Majesty Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi has deemed it necessary that a successor to the throne must be of direct descent in the male line from generation to generation to generation, I will with my deepest regret in the interest of the future of the State and of the welfare of the people in accordance with the desire of His Majesty the Emperor sacrifice my own happiness, and I will declare my consent to a separation from His Imperial Majesty.&quot; Soraya was well rewarded for the divorce with the Shah buying her a penthouse apartment in Paris that was valued at $3 million US, paying her a monthly alimony of $7,000 US (that continued to be paid until the Islamic Revolution overthrew Mohammad Reza in 1979), together with various luxuries such as a 1958 Rolls-Royce Phantom IV, a Mercedes-Benz 300 SL, a Bulgari ruby, a Van Cleef &amp; Arpels brooch and a Harry Winston platinum ring with a 22.37-carat diamond that after her death was sold at the estate auction for $838,350 US.

After the divorce, the Shah, who had told a reporter who asked about his feelings for the former Queen that &quot;nobody can carry a torch longer than me&quot;, indicated his interest in marrying Princess Maria Gabriella of Savoy, a daughter of the deposed Italian king Umberto II. In an editorial about the rumors surrounding the marriage of &quot;a Muslim sovereign and a Catholic princess&quot;, the Vatican newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;, considered the match &quot;a grave danger&quot;.

==Career as actress==
After her divorce, Soraya was in a relationship with the director Maximilian Schell and the industrial heir Gunter Sachs and also lived briefly in Munich. Later Soraya moved to France. She launched a brief career as a film actress, for which she used only her first name. Initially, it was announced that she would portray Catherine the Great in a movie about the Russian empress by Dino De Laurentiis, but that project fell through. Instead, she starred in the 1965 movie &quot;I tre volti&quot; (&quot;The Three Faces&quot;) and became the companion of its Italian director, Franco Indovina (1932–72). She appeared as a character named Soraya in the 1965 movie &quot;She&quot;.
After Indovina&#x27;s death in a plane crash, she spent the remainder of her life in Europe, succumbing to depression, which she outlined in her 1991 memoir, &quot;Le Palais des solitudes&quot; (&quot;The Palace of Loneliness&quot;).

==Later years in Paris==
During her last years, Soraya lived in Paris on 46 avenue Montaigne. She occasionally attended social events like the parties given by the Duchess de La Rochefoucauld. Her friend and event organizer Massimo Gargia tried to cheer her up and make her meet young people. Soraya was a regular client of the hairdresser Alexandre Zouari. She also enjoyed going to the bar and the lobby of the Hotel Plaza Athénée located opposite her apartment. She was often accompanied by her former lady-in-waiting and loyal friend Madame Chamrizad Firouzabadian. Another friend was Parisian socialite Lily Claire Sarran.

In 1979, Soraya wrote to Mohammad Reza as he was dying of cancer in Panama, saying she still loved him and wanted to see him one last time. Mohammad Reza was greatly moved by her letters, and wrote back to her saying he also still loved her and wanted to see her one last time as well, but said his third wife Empress Farah could not be present, which presented problems as she was constantly by the former Shah&#x27;s bedside as he lay dying. In 1980, it was agreed that Soraya would visit Mohammad Reza in Cairo, but he died before she could make the trip, which led Milani to comment that Mohammad Reza and Soraya were true &quot;star-crossed lovers&quot;. Soraya did not communicate with Farah, even when both lived in Paris.

==Death==
 Soraya died on 25 October 2001 of undisclosed causes in her apartment in Paris, France; she was 69. Upon learning of her death, her younger brother, Bijan, sadly commented, &quot;After her, I don&#x27;t have anyone to talk to.&quot; Bijan died one week later.

After her funeral at the American Cathedral in Paris on 6 November 2001 which was attended by Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, Prince Gholam Reza Pahlavi, the Count and Countess of Paris, the Prince and Princess of Naples, Prince Michel of Orléans, and Princess Ira von Fürstenberg she was buried in the Westfriedhof Quarter Nr. 143, in a cemetery in Munich, along with her parents and brother.

Since her death, several women have come forward claiming to be her illegitimate daughter, reportedly born in 1962. According to the Persian-language weekly &quot;Nimrooz&quot; none of the claims has been confirmed. The newspaper also published an article in 2001 which suggested, without proof, that Princess Soraya and her brother had been murdered. Her belongings were sold at auction in Paris in 2002, for more than $8.3 million.

==Memoirs==

Princess Soraya wrote two memoirs. The first, published in 1964 and published in the United States by Doubleday, was &quot;Princess Soraya: Autobiography of Her Imperial Highness&quot;. A decade before her death, she and a collaborator, Louis Valentin, wrote another memoir in French, &quot;Le Palais des solitudes&quot; (Paris: France Loisirs/Michel Laffon, 1991), which was translated into English as &quot;Palace of Solitude&quot; (London: Quartet Books Ltd, 1992); .

==Legacy==

Soraya&#x27;s divorce from the Shah inspired French songwriter Francoise Mallet-Jorris to write &quot;Je veux pleurer comme Soraya&quot; (I Want to Cry Like Soraya). A French rose grower bred a sunflower in the former queen&#x27;s honor, which he called &quot;Empress Soraya&quot;.

An Italian/German television movie about the princess&#x27;s life, &quot;&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Sad Princess&quot;), was broadcast in 2003, starring Anna Valle as Soraya and Erol Sander as the Shah. French actress Mathilda May appeared as the Shah&#x27;s sister, Princess Shams Pahlavi.

<text>Chris &quot;Floyd&quot; Zaiger (April 26, 1926 – June 2, 2020) was an American fruit breeder particularly known for hybrid development of stone fruit and numerous plant patents. Zaiger founded Zaiger&#x27;s Genetics, a fruit-breeding business in Modesto, California, which is now an international business selling cultivars and hybrids. Zaiger developed varieties such as the pluot, and has been called &quot;the most prolific stone fruit breeder in the modern era.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Chris Floyd Zaiger was born to Christian Fredrick Zaiger and Anna Marie Zaiger on April 26, 1926, in Kennard, Nebraska. The family moved to Iowa and then Oregon, before coming to California&#x27;s San Joaquin Valley. He attended school until eighth grade and worked as a migrant strawberry picker. During World War II, he was drafted into the U.S. Army where he served as a paratrooper in the 11th Airborne Division. Zaiger earned a degree in plant pathology and agricultural education in 1952 from the University of California, Davis. He taught agriculture classes at Modesto city high schools, Livingston High School, and Modesto Junior College.

== Career ==
In 1954, Zaiger and wife Betty purchased a 2.5 acre nursery and began breeding heat-tolerant azaleas as a hobby. In 1956 and 1957, he apprenticed with breeder Fred Anderson, a protege of Luther Burbank and developer of the nectarine. While the Zaiger family continued to operate an ornamental nursery until 1990, Zaiger and family are better known for fruit variety development. The family-owned company Zaiger Genetics cross-pollinates by hand, rather than gene-splicing or DNA manipulation, to develop new hybrids. As of 2020, they have patented 446 plant varieties. 

Zaiger&#x27;s first patented varieties were the Royal Gold peach, introduced in 1965, and ‘Crimson Gold’ nectarine. He revolutionized the plum industry by backcrossing plum-apricot hybrids with plums to create the Pluot. His work has also reduced the chill-hours needed for fruits like cherries which allow them to be grown in warmer climates and produced peaches and nectarines that are sweet, yet firm allowing for intercontinental shipping. Another invention, the &#x27;Independence&#x27; almond is self-fertile allowing pollination without the use of honeybees needed for other almond varieties. He created the aprium, a hybrid cross between apricots and plums but more similar to apricots.

== Personal life ==
Zaiger married Betty Jean Taylor in 1950 and they had three children Leith, Gary, and Grant. Zaiger died at his home in Modesto, California on June 2, 2020.

==Awards and recognition==
* 1995 Wilder Award from the American Pomological Society for &quot;distinguished service and contributions to the advancement of pomological science and for outstanding fruit varieties&quot; 
* 1997 Awarded rank of Officier, Ordre du Mérite Agricole
* 1999 Alumni Award of Distinction award from UC Davis College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences

<doc id="287444" wikidata="Q142546" url="?curid=287444" title="Tippi Hedren">
<text>Nathalie Kay &quot;Tippi&quot; Hedren (born January 19, 1930) is an American retired actress. Initially a fashion model, appearing on the front covers of &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Glamour&quot; magazines (among others), she became an actress after being discovered by director Alfred Hitchcock while appearing on a television commercial in 1961. Hedren achieved great praise for her work in two of his films, including the suspense-thriller &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963), for which she won a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year, and the psychological drama &quot;Marnie&quot; (1964). She performed in over 80 films and television shows, including Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s final film &quot;A Countess from Hong Kong&quot; (1967), the political satire &quot;Citizen Ruth&quot; (1996), and the existential comedy &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (2004). Among other honors, her contributions to world cinema have been recognized with the Jules Verne Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Hedren&#x27;s strong commitment to animal rescue began in 1969 while she was shooting two films in Africa and was introduced to the plight of African lions. In an attempt to raise awareness for wildlife, she spent over a decade bringing &quot;Roar&quot; (1981) to the screen. She started her own nonprofit organization, the Roar Foundation, in 1983; it supports the Shambala Preserve, an wildlife habitat that enables her to continue her work in the care and preservation of lions and tigers. Hedren has also set up relief programs worldwide following earthquakes, hurricanes, famine and war. She was also instrumental in the development of Vietnamese-American nail salons.

==Early life==
Nathalie Kay Hedren was born in New Ulm, Minnesota, on January 19, 1930, to Bernard Carl and Dorothea Henrietta Hedren (née Eckhardt). Her family moved to Morningside, Minnesota, a neighborhood in Edina, Minnesota, when Hedren was 4, where she lived until she was 17 and modeled for Dayton&#x27;s. For much of her career, her year of birth was misreported as 1935. In a 2004 A&amp;E &quot;Biography&quot;, Hedren acknowledged that she was born in 1930, which is consistent with the birth registration index at the Minnesota Historical Society. Her paternal grandparents were Swedish immigrants, while her mother was of German and Norwegian descent.

Hedren was educated at Morningside School, and at West High School in Minneapolis.

==Career==
===1950–1960: Modeling===
On reaching her 20th birthday, Hedren bought a ticket to New York City, where she joined the Eileen Ford Agency. Within a year, she made her unofficial film debut as &quot;Miss Ice Box&quot; in the musical comedy &quot;The Petty Girl&quot;. In interviews, she referred to &quot;The Birds,&quot; her first credited role, as her first film. Although she received several film offers during that time, Hedren had no interest in acting, as she knew it was very difficult to succeed.

She had a highly successful modeling career during the 1950s and early 1960s, appearing on the covers of &quot;Life,&quot; &quot;The Saturday Evening Post,&quot; &quot;McCall&#x27;s,&quot; and &quot;Glamour,&quot; among others. In 1961, after seven years of marriage to the actor Peter Griffith, Hedren divorced and returned to California with her daughter, Melanie, and rented an expensive home in Sherman Oaks. She later said, &quot;I thought I could continue my career as it had been in New York. I thought everything would be just fine, and it wasn&#x27;t. So I thought, &#x27;well, I don&#x27;t type, what shall I do?

===1961–1966: Transition to acting and Alfred Hitchcock===
====Discovery (1961)====
On October 13, 1961, she received a call from an agent who told her a producer was interested in working with her. When she was told it was Alfred Hitchcock, who while watching &quot;The Today Show,&quot; saw her in a commercial for a diet drink called Sego, she agreed to sign a seven-year contract. During their first meeting, the two talked about everything except the role for which he was considering her. Hedren was convinced for several weeks it was for his television series, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents.&quot; 

Being an unknown actress with little training, Hitchcock put Hedren through an extensive color screen test that lasted two days and cost $25,000, doing scenes from his previous films, such as &quot;Rebecca,&quot; &quot;Notorious,&quot; and &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; with actor Martin Balsam. According to Balsam, Hedren was very nervous, but studied every line, did every move she was asked to, and tried to do everything right. Hitchcock asked costume designer Edith Head to design clothes for Hedren&#x27;s private life and he personally advised her about wine and food. He also insisted for publicity purposes that her name should be printed only in single quotes, &#x27;Tippi&#x27;. The press mostly ignored this directive from the director, who felt that the single quotes added distinction and mystery to her name. Hitchcock was impressed with Hedren. As production designer Robert F. Boyle explained, &quot;Hitch always liked women who behaved like well-bred ladies. Tippi generated that quality.&quot;

Afterward, Hedren was invited to lunch with Hitchcock, his wife, Alma, and Lew Wasserman, head of Universal, at one of Hitchcock&#x27;s favorite restaurants, Chasen&#x27;s. There, she was presented with a golden pin of three birds in flight, adorned by three tiny seed pearls, and was asked by Hitchcock to play the leading role in his upcoming film &quot;The Birds.&quot; &quot;I was so stunned. It never occurred to me that I would be given a leading role in a major motion picture. I had great big tears in my eyes,&quot; Hedren later recalled.

====&quot;The Birds&quot; (1963)====

&quot;The Birds&quot; (1963) was Hedren&#x27;s screen debut. Hitchcock became her drama coach, and gave her an education in film-making, as she attended many of the production meetings such as script, music, or photography conferences. Hedren said, &quot;I probably learned in three years what it would have taken me 15 years to learn otherwise.&quot; She learned how to break down a script, to become another character, and to study the relationship of different characters. Hedren portrayed her role of Melanie Daniels as Hitchcock requested. She said, &quot;He gives his actors very little leeway. He&#x27;ll listen, but he has a very definite plan in mind as to how he wants his characters to act. With me, it was understandable, because I was not an actress of stature. I welcomed his guidance.&quot;

During the six months of principal photography, Hedren&#x27;s schedule was tight, as she was only given one afternoon off a week. At first, she found the shooting &quot;wonderful&quot;. Hitchcock told a reporter, after a few weeks of filming, that she was remarkable, and said, &quot;She&#x27;s already reaching the lows and highs of terror.&quot; Nonetheless, Hedren recalled the week she did the final bird attack scene in a second-floor bedroom as the worst of her life. Before filming it, she asked Hitchcock about her character&#x27;s motivations to go upstairs, and his response was, &quot;Because I tell you to.&quot; She was then assured that the crew would use mechanical birds. Instead, Hedren endured five solid days of prop men, protected by thick leather gloves, flinging dozens of live gulls, ravens, and crows at her (their beaks clamped shut with elastic bands). In a state of exhaustion, when one of the birds gouged her cheek and narrowly missed her eye, Hedren sat down on the set and began crying. A physician ordered a week&#x27;s rest. Hitchcock protested, according to Hedren, saying she was the only one left to film. The doctor&#x27;s reply was, &quot;Are you trying to kill her?&quot; She said the week also appeared to be an ordeal for the director.

Universal&#x27;s executives, who did not back Hitchcock&#x27;s decision to hire Hedren in the first place, were impressed with her performance and Wasserman described it as &quot;remarkable&quot;. While promoting &quot;The Birds,&quot; Hitchcock was full of praise for his new protégée, and compared her to Grace Kelly. &quot;Tippi has a faster tempo, city glibness, more humor [than Grace Kelly]. She displayed jaunty assuredness, pertness, an attractive throw of the head, and she memorized and read lines extraordinarily well and is sharper in expression.&quot; The film was screened out of competition in May at a prestigious invitational showing at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. Hedren&#x27;s performance was praised in &quot;Variety&quot;″s review: &quot;Aside from the birds, the film belongs to Hedren, who makes an auspicious screen bow. She virtually has to carry the picture alone for the first 45-minute stretch, prior to the advent of the first wave of organized attackers from the sky. Miss Hedren has a star quality and Hitchcock has provided her with a potent vehicle to launch her career.&quot; Hedren received the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year, tied with Elke Sommer and Ursula Andress. Her role as Melanie Daniels was named by &quot;Premiere&quot; as one of the greatest film characters of all time.

==== &quot;Marnie&quot; (1964)====

Hitchcock was so impressed with Hedren&#x27;s acting abilities, he decided to offer her the leading role of his next film, &quot;Marnie&quot; (1964), a romantic drama and psychological thriller from the novel by Winston Graham, during the filming of &quot;The Birds.&quot; Hedren was stunned and felt extremely fortunate to be offered to play &quot;such a complicated, sad, tragic woman&quot;, and later said, &quot;I consider my acting, while not necessarily being method acting, but one that draws upon my own feelings. I thought Marnie was an extremely interesting role to play and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.&quot; She voiced doubts about her ability to play the demanding role, but Hitchcock assured her she could do it. As opposed to &quot;The Birds,&quot; where she had received little acting guidance, for this film Hedren studied every scene with Hitchcock.

Hedren recalled &quot;Marnie&quot; as her favorite of the two films she did with Hitchcock for the challenge of playing an emotionally battered young woman who travels from city to city assuming various guises to rob her employers. During the filming, Hitchcock was quoted as saying about Hedren, &quot;an Academy Award performance is in the making.&quot; On release, the film was greeted by mixed reviews and indifferent box-office returns, and received no Oscar nominations. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Hedren returns in a particularly demanding role. Miss Hedren, undertaking a role originally offered Grace Kelly for a resumption of her screen career, lends credence to a part never sympathetic. It&#x27;s a difficult assignment which she fulfills satisfactorily.&quot; Hedren later said that &quot;Marnie&quot; was &quot;ahead of its time&quot; because &quot;people didn&#x27;t talk about childhood and its effects on adult life. It was taboo to discuss sexuality and psychology and to put all that into a film was shocking.&quot; Despite its original lukewarm reception, the film was later acclaimed and described as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and Hedren&#x27;s performance is now regarded as one of the finest in any Hitchcock film. Richard Brody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote in his 2016 review of the film &quot;Hedren&#x27;s performance is one of the greatest in the history of cinema.&quot;

====Allegations of sexual harassment====

&quot;Marnie&quot; was the second and last collaboration between Hedren and Hitchcock. In 1973, she admitted that a major lifestyle difference caused a split in their relationship. &quot;He was too possessive and too demanding. I cannot be possessed by anyone. But, then, that&#x27;s my own hangup.&quot; In 1983, author Donald Spoto published his second book about Hitchcock, &quot;The Dark Side of Genius,&quot; for which Hedren agreed to talk for the first time in detail about her relationship with the director.
The book was controversial, as several of Hitchcock&#x27;s friends claimed the Hitchcock portrayed in the book was not the man they knew. For years after its release, Hedren was not keen to talk about it in interviews, but thought the chapter devoted to her story was &quot;accurate as to just what he was&quot;. Hedren later explained her long silence before telling her story, &quot;It was embarrassing and insulting—there were a lot of reasons why I didn&#x27;t want to tell the story. I didn&#x27;t want it to be taken advantage of, twisted, turned, and made into an even uglier situation than it was.&quot;
According to Spoto&#x27;s book, Hitchcock brought in two members of his crew during the filming of &quot;The Birds&quot; and asked them to keep careful watch on the activities of Hedren, &quot;when she left the set—where she went, who she visited, how she spent her free time&quot;. He then advised her on what she should eat, whom she should see, and how she should live. He told the cast and crew they were not allowed to talk to her. Hedren&#x27;s co-star in &quot;The Birds,&quot; Rod Taylor, later remembered, &quot;Hitch was becoming very domineering and covetous of &#x27;Tippi&#x27;, and it was very difficult for her. No one was permitted to come physically close to her during the production. &#x27;Don&#x27;t touch the girl after I call &quot;Cut! he said to me repeatedly.&quot; Hitchcock also attempted, on one occasion, to grab and violently kiss Hedren in the back of a car as they drove onto the set. Hedren told his assistant, Peggy Robertson, and the studio chief, Lew Wasserman, that she was becoming very unhappy about the whole situation. &quot;But he was Alfred Hitchcock, the great and famous director, and I was Tippi Hedren, an inexperienced actress who had no clout.&quot; She decided she could not quit her contract because she was afraid to be blacklisted and unable to find work. Hedren&#x27;s own daughter, Melanie Griffith, remembered that while Hedren was doing &quot;The Birds,&quot; she thought Hitchcock was taking her mother away from her. &quot;Suddenly, I wasn&#x27;t allowed even to visit my mom at the studio.&quot;

During the filming of &quot;Marnie,&quot; Hedren found Hitchcock&#x27;s behavior toward her increasingly difficult to bear as filming progressed. &quot;Everyone – I mean everyone – knew he was obsessed with me. He always wanted a glass of wine or champagne, with me alone, at the end of the day. He was really isolating me from everyone.&quot; Hedren&#x27;s co-star in &quot;Marnie,&quot; Diane Baker, later recalled, &quot;She was never allowed to gather around with the rest of us, and he demanded that every conversation between her and Hitch be held in private... Nothing could have been more horrible for me than to arrive on that movie set and to see her being treated the way she was.&quot;

Hitchcock revealed to Hedren one day he had a recurring dream where she came up to him and said, &quot;Hitch, I love you – I&#x27;ll always love you.&quot; When she heard this, Hedren replied &quot;But it was a dream. Just a dream,&quot; and excused herself from his presence. She believed Hitchcock had no consideration for her feelings and remembered she was humiliated after he asked her to touch him, just before shooting a scene. &quot;He made sure no one else could hear, and his tone and glance made it clear exactly what he meant.&quot; Hedren asked Hitchcock&#x27;s permission one day to travel to New York to appear on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, where she was supposed to be presented an award as the &quot;Most Promising New Star&quot;. Hitchcock refused, according to his biographer, because he claimed the break would affect her performance. During that meeting, he apparently &quot;made an overt sexual proposition&quot; that Hedren &quot;could neither ignore nor answer casually, as she could his previous gestures&quot;. In Spoto&#x27;s third book about Hitchcock, &quot;Spellbound by Beauty&quot; (2008), Hedren revealed that Hitchcock actually made offensive demands on her. &quot;He stared at me and simply said, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, that from this time on, he expected me to make myself sexually available and accessible to him – however and whenever and wherever he wanted.&quot; Hitchcock&#x27;s demands led to a &quot;horrible, horrible fight&quot;, according to Hedren. &quot;He made these demands on me, and no way could I acquiesce to them.&quot;
Hedren then told him &quot;Marnie&quot; would be their last film together and later recalled how Hitchcock told her he would destroy her career. &quot;I said I wanted to get out of my contract. He said: &#x27;You can&#x27;t. You have your daughter to support, and your parents are getting older.&#x27; I said: &#x27;Nobody would want me to be in this situation, I want to get out.&#x27; And he said: &#x27;I&#x27;ll ruin your career.&#x27; I said: &#x27;Do what you have to do.&#x27; And he did ruin my career. He kept me under contract, paid me to do nothing for close on two years.&quot; Hedren felt so humiliated, she called the director a &quot;fat pig&quot; in front of people on the set. Hitchcock made only a comment about it to his biographer, John Russell Taylor: &quot;She did what no one is permitted to do. She referred to my weight.&quot; The two communicated only through a third party for the rest of the film. According to &quot;Marnie&quot;&#x27;s screenwriter, Jay Presson Allen, Hitchcock was &quot;mad&quot; for Hedren. She felt unhappy for both and described the situation as &quot;an old man&#x27;s &quot;&quot;&quot;, adding that Hitchcock had a &quot;Pygmalion complex about Tippi&quot;. She advised Hedren to finish the film and then get on with her life and be happy. Hedren&#x27;s hairdresser, Virginia Darcy, even told Hitchcock he should not be possessive with Hedren. &quot;Tippi felt rightly that she was not his property, but he&#x27;d say, &#x27;You are, I have a contract. Although Hitchcock thought he might mend fences with Hedren and make another film with her, she refused to reconsider her decision. Hedren&#x27;s contract terms gave Hitchcock the final say as to any work she could take on and he used that power to turn down several film roles on her behalf. She was particularly disappointed when French director François Truffaut told her he had wanted her for one of them. In 1966, Hitchcock finally sold her contract to Universal Studios after Hedren appeared in two of their TV shows, &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot; (1965) and &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; (id.). The studio ultimately released her from her contract after she refused to appear on a television Western for them.
In 2012, &quot;The Girl&quot;, an HBO/BBC film about Hedren and Hitchcock&#x27;s relationship, based on Donald Spoto&#x27;s 2008 book &quot;Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies&quot;, was released. When she was first told about the project, Hedren said she had mixed feelings about it, &quot;To be still alive and have a film made about you is an awesome and incredibly frightening experience.&quot; Hedren and Hitchcock were respectively portrayed by Sienna Miller and Toby Jones.
Although she was thrilled with the choice of Miller, Hedren was worried she would not be portrayed &quot;as strong a character as I was – and still am. I had to be extremely strong to fight off Mr. Hitchcock.&quot; She described the moment she saw the film as &quot;probably one of the most involved, emotionally tense 90 minutes that I have ever lived&quot;. Upon the film&#x27;s release, Hedren said although she believed the film accurately portrays Hitchcock&#x27;s behavior towards her, the time constraints of a 90-minute film prevented telling the entire story of her career with him. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a constant barrage of harassment. If it had been constantly the way we have had to do it in this film, I would have been long gone.&quot; She recalled there were times she described as &quot;absolutely delightful and wonderful&quot;, and insisted that &quot;Hitchcock had a charm about him. He was very funny at times. He was incredibly brilliant in his field.&quot; The film was controversial, as others who knew and worked with Hitchcock responded to it negatively. Kim Novak, who worked on Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958), disputed Hitchcock&#x27;s portrayal as a sexual predator in &quot;The Girl&quot;: &quot;I never saw him make a pass at anybody or act strange to anybody. And wouldn&#x27;t you think if he was that way, I would&#x27;ve seen it or at least seen him with somebody? I think it&#x27;s unfortunate when someone&#x27;s no longer around and can&#x27;t defend themselves.&quot; Novak previously described Hitchcock as a gentleman, and when asked about reports of his behavior, she said, &quot;Maybe I just wasn&#x27;t his type.&quot; Novak also stated, &quot;I won&#x27;t dispute Tippi if that&#x27;s what she saw.&quot;

Hedren herself was asked why her account of sexual harassment contrasted with the many interviews she gave about her time with Hitchcock, her presence at the AFI Life Achievement Award ceremony honoring him in 1979, and her presence at his funeral. She explained that, &quot;He ruined my career, but he didn&#x27;t ruin my life. That time of my life was over. I still admire the man for who he was.&quot; She also said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been able to separate the two. The man who was the artist. I mean, what he gave to the motion picture industry can never be taken away from him and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to try. But on the other side, there is that dark side that was really awful.&quot;

It also was the basis for the John Logan play &quot;Double Feature&quot; (2024) with Joanna Vanderham playing Hedren and Ian McNeice playing Hitchcock. It played at the Hampstead theatre in London, England.

===Career setbacks (1967–1973)===

Hedren&#x27;s first feature film appearance after &quot;Marnie&quot; was in the 1967 film &quot;A Countess from Hong Kong&quot;, starring Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren. She was told by writer-director Charlie Chaplin that he was offering her a major supporting role as Brando&#x27;s estranged wife but had to accept the role without reading the script. However, when she arrived in England, where the filming took place, she finally received the script and realized that her part was little more than a cameo. She asked Chaplin why he had lied to her. &quot;Every actor in the world was asking if they could do this film, to just do a walk-on, without even being paid for it. When I said, &#x27;Why didn&#x27;t you just tell me that it was a cameo? I would have done this film anyway?&#x27; He said, &#x27;I didn&#x27;t think you would come,&#x27; which was very sweet. He was a very clever man.&quot; 

Hedren asked Chaplin to expand the role, and although he tried to accommodate her, he could not, as the story mostly takes place on a ship, which Hedren&#x27;s character boards near the end of the film. In the end, she remained in the film and later said that it was both amusing and strange to work with Chaplin. She found him to be a very serious man and loved his approach to directing. She later said, &quot;I wish someone would have been allowed to do a documentary. The way he directed was unlike anyone I ever saw. He acted out all the parts himself. He did Sophia&#x27;s part, then Marlon&#x27;s part, then mine, and then he&#x27;d say, &#x27;Okay, now you can do it.&#x27; Which would be impossible, to mimic the master. It was incredible. None of us believed it. Marlon hated it.&quot;
After the release of &quot;A Countess from Hong Kong&quot;, Hedren&#x27;s career was described as &quot;spectacular&quot; by the press. She told a reporter at the time, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to wait myself out of this business, but working for Hitch and Charlie has been very special to me, and now I&#x27;m going to wait for something special to come along.&quot; In 1968, she signed on to do the American Civil War drama &quot;Five Against Kansas&quot; with Farley Granger and Jeffrey Hunter, but the project was never realized. In 1968, Hedren returned to film as a socialite who helps her boyfriend (played by George Armstrong) catch a killer, in &quot;Tiger by the Tail&quot;. From 1970 to 1971, she guest-starred twice on &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;. She agreed to take part in &quot;Satan&#x27;s Harvest&quot; (1970) and &quot;Mister Kingstreet&#x27;s War&quot; (1973)—which were shot back-to-back despite the discrepancy in their release dates—for the sole reason that they were being filmed in Africa. 

In 1973, Hedren played a teacher at an experimental sex school in &quot;The Harrad Experiment&quot;, which starred James Whitmore and Don Johnson—the latter who would later marry her daughter, Melanie Griffith. Hedren felt that the film &quot;deals with vital themes—themes like the decline in importance of ideas like possession and jealousy and, by inference, marriage. I have four teenaged children and I think this picture says some valuable things to them.&quot; She confessed at the time that she was occasionally depressed because she was not doing any major films, and told a magazine, &quot;My husband just cancelled all the trade magazines because he felt I should cut off the source of my discontent. He&#x27;s the type who won&#x27;t stand for sustained down feelings.&quot;

===&quot;Roar&quot; (1974–1981)===

Hedren and husband Noel Marshall watched a pride of lions move into a house after a game warden moved out in 1969, during the filming of &quot;Satan&#x27;s Harvest&quot; in Africa. She said, &quot;We were delighted with the way they adapted themselves to living there. And they were so funny we knew we had an idea for a picture.&quot; Marshall wrote a script titled &quot;Lions, Lions and More Lions&quot; based on their experience; it was retitled &quot;Roar&quot; and centered on a family&#x27;s misadventures in a research park filled with lions, tigers, and other wild cats.

Hedren played the lead role and co-starred with her daughter Melanie, husband Marshall, and his own sons Jerry and John. They attempted to rent Hollywood animals for a nine-month shoot, but upon approaching animal trainers for support, they were discouraged and nobody would rent them 30 or 40 lions, as the script required, because of their natural tendency to fight. They were encouraged to start collecting and training their own exotic beasts. Animal trainer Ron Oxley told them, &quot;to get to know about lions, you&#x27;ve got to live with them for a while&quot;. They started to raise a lion cub named Neil in their Sherman Oaks house and made sure that the animal slept in their bed. &quot;Life&quot; photographer Michael Rougier documented their life in 1971 and photographed the lion with the whole family inside and outside the house, from Hedren&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s bed to the living room to the swimming pool. After complaints from their neighbors, Hedren and Marshall bought a ranch outside of Los Angeles in Acton that would serve as the set for &quot;Roar&quot;. They got permission there to rescue and raise several lions, tigers, African elephants, and other exotic felines.

Filming started in 1974 and took five years just to complete the photography. Every scene involving lions was improvised and shot with four or sometimes eight cameras. More than 100 people worked on the film, as well as more than 150 untrained lions, tigers, leopards, and cheetahs. During production, no animals were hurt, but more than 70 members of the cast and crew were mauled. Hedren fractured a leg and also had scalp wounds when an elephant bucked her off its back while she was riding it. She was also bitten in the neck by a lion and required 38 stitches; this incident can be seen in the film. Melanie Griffith was also attacked, receiving 50 stitches to her face; it was feared that she would lose an eye, but she recovered and was not disfigured. Marshall was attacked so many times that he eventually was diagnosed with gangrene. In one of those incidents, he was clawed by a cheetah when protecting the animals during a bushfire that occurred in 1979. All animals were evacuated, and several years were needed for him to recover from his injuries. In 1978, a flood destroyed the film sets and killed three of the lions. The project was set back several years. Hedren said that they were all determined to finish the film: &quot;We were so sure the film was going to be a success that we thought everything (financing the ranch and the lions, etc.) would take care of itself.&quot;

&quot;Roar&quot; was released worldwide in 1981 with the exception of the United States, because according to Hedren, &quot;The United States distributors wanted the lion&#x27;s share of the profits, and we thought it ought to go to the beautiful animals that made the movie.&quot; The film cost $17 million and grossed only $2 million, but it was a turning point in Hedren&#x27;s life. In 1983, she established the nonprofit The Roar Foundation to take care of the big cats. &quot;After our movie was over,&quot; she explained, &quot;it was unconscionable to see the animals go any place else.&quot; &quot;Roar&quot; was re-released in 2015, but Hedren declined to discuss it, as she felt that promotion for the film was filled with &quot;inaccuracies&quot;.

===Later career (1982–present)===
After &quot;Roar&quot;, Hedren accepted any low-budget television or cinema role that could help bring funds to her foundation to provide protection, shelter, care, and maintenance for the animals at the Shambala Preserve. In 1982, she co-starred with Leslie Nielsen in &quot;Foxfire Light&quot;. She appeared in several television series, including &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; in 1983 and the late-night horror series &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot; in 1984. In the 1985 pilot episode of &quot;The New Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, she made a brief appearance as a waitress in a bar who berates a customer, played by her daughter Melanie Griffith. In 1990, she had a nonspeaking, minor part as a wealthy widow romanced by Michael Keaton in the film &quot;Pacific Heights&quot; (1990), which also starred her daughter. That same year, she had a role on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, a daytime soap opera she said she was &quot;proud to have in my resume&quot;.
In 1994, Hedren appeared in the made-for-cable sequel, &quot;The Birds II: Land&#x27;s End&quot;, in a role different from the one she had played in the original. She was, however, disappointed that she did not get a starring role and admitted before the film&#x27;s release, &quot;I wish that it was more than a cameo. I think they made a mistake by not doing that, but it has helped me to feed my lions and tigers.&quot; When asked about what could have been Hitchcock&#x27;s opinion on the film, she answered: &quot;I&#x27;d hate to think what he would say!&quot; However, in a 2007 interview Hedren said of the film: &quot;It&#x27;s absolutely horrible, it embarrasses me horribly.&quot;

From 1994 to 1996, Hedren had a guest-starring role in &quot;Dream On&quot;. The sitcom gave her &quot;the opportunity to do comedy. I&#x27;d never done comedy before and it was just wonderful for me to be able to do that. Everybody just thought of me as a serious actress, so I owe that to John Landis (the executive producer), giving me that opportunity.&quot; In 1996, she played an abortion rights activist in Alexander Payne&#x27;s political satire &quot;Citizen Ruth&quot; with Laura Dern. In 1998, she co-starred alongside Billy Zane and Christina Ricci in &quot;I Woke Up Early the Day I Died&quot;, a film she felt was &quot;incredible&quot;. &quot;I must say I really love that film. It was a unique kind of film to do also, because it had no dialogue in it. It was very, very different.&quot; That same year, she guest-starred in a special episode titled &quot;Psychodrama&quot; of the television series &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, that paid tribute to the Hitchcock films. Hedren&#x27;s character, Alfreda Perkins, was a reference to Alfred Hitchcock and actor Anthony Perkins, who starred in the director&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;Psycho&quot;.

After appearing in a number of little-exposed films between 1999 and 2003, Hedren had a small but showy role in the 2004 David O. Russell comedy &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot;, as a foul-mouthed attractive older woman who slaps Jude Law in an elevator. She felt that the director, who had a reputation for being difficult, was &quot;totally crazy&quot;, but also &quot;very interesting. I was able to work well with him.&quot; She also added it was a strange experience as, &quot;... all of a sudden, he&#x27;d be like, &#x27;Now I&#x27;m going to do it this way,&#x27; and you&#x27;d think, &#x27;How is he going to edit this? How is this going to work?&#x27; But he made it work.&quot; In 2006, Hedren was a cast member of the short-lived primetime soap opera &quot;Fashion House&quot; with Bo Derek and Morgan Fairchild, and continued to guest-star in television series such as &quot;The 4400&quot; (2006) and &quot;&quot; (2008). In 2012, Hedren and her daughter guest-starred together on an episode of &quot;Raising Hope&quot;. That same year, she appeared in &quot;Free Samples&quot;, an indie film where she had a supporting role as an old movie star. In 2013, she made an appearance as herself in the fourth-season finale of &quot;Cougar Town&quot;.

Hedren published her autobiography, &quot;Tippi: A Memoir&quot;, co-written with Lindsay Harrison, in 2016 through William Morrow and Company, as she felt it was &quot;about time I stop letting everyone else tell my story and finally tell it myself&quot;. In 2018, at age 88, Hedren became the new face of Gucci&#x27;s timepieces and jewelry and starred as a mysterious fortune teller in the brand&#x27;s commercial ad, &quot;The Fortune Teller&quot;.

==Influence==
A Louis Vuitton ad campaign in 2006 paid tribute to Hedren and Hitchcock with a modern-day interpretation of the deserted railway station opening sequence of &quot;Marnie&quot;. Her look from &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963) inspired designer Bill Gaytten&#x27;s designs for John Galliano&#x27;s pre-fall 2012 collection.

Naomi Watts stated that her character interpretation in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; (2001) was influenced by the look and performances of Hedren in Hitchcock films. Watts and Hedren both appeared in &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (2004), but did not share any scenes together. Off screen, the film&#x27;s director David O. Russell introduced them, and Watts said of Hedren: &quot;I was pretty fascinated by her then, because people have often said we&#x27;re alike.&quot; Watts was styled as Hedren&#x27;s title character from &quot;Marnie&quot; for a photo shoot for March 2008 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. In the same issue, Jodie Foster was styled as Hedren&#x27;s character, Melanie Daniels, from &quot;The Birds&quot;.

== Animal rights activism ==
Hedren&#x27;s strong commitment to animal rescue began in 1969 while she was shooting two films in Africa and was introduced to the plight of African lions. In an attempt to raise awareness for wildlife, she spent over a decade bringing &quot;Roar&quot; (1981) to the screen. She started her own nonprofit organization, the Roar Foundation, in 1983; it supports the Shambala Preserve, an wildlife habitat that enables her to continue her work in the care and preservation of lions and tigers.

===Shambala Preserve===
In 1981, Hedren produced &quot;Roar&quot;, an 11-year project that ended up costing $17 million and starred dozens of African lions. &quot;This was probably one of the most dangerous films that Hollywood has ever seen&quot;, remarked the actress. &quot;It&#x27;s amazing no one was killed.&quot; During the production of &quot;Roar&quot;, Hedren, her husband at the time, Noel Marshall, and daughter Melanie were attacked by lions; Jan de Bont, the director of photography, was scalped. Hedren later co-wrote &quot;Cats of Shambala&quot; (1985) about the experience. &quot;Roar&quot; made only $2 million worldwide. Hedren ended her marriage to Marshall a year later in 1982. The film directly led to the 1983 establishment of the nonprofit The Roar Foundation and Hedren&#x27;s Shambala Preserve, located at the edge of the Mojave Desert in Acton, California, between the Antelope Valley and the Santa Clarita Valley, northeast of Los Angeles. Shambala houses some 70 animals. Hedren lives on the Shambala site and conducts monthly tours of the preserve for the public. In a 2015 interview with magazine &quot;Ability&quot;, Hedren emphasized that there is no human contact with the animals and that all of the cats are spayed and neutered, since they are being raised in captivity. Hedren was the founding president of the American Sanctuary Association, a post she still holds.

She took in and cared for Togar, a lion that belonged to Anton LaVey, after he was told by San Francisco officials that he could not keep a fully grown lion as a house pet. Shambala became the new home for Michael Jackson&#x27;s two Bengal tigers, Sabu and Thriller, after he decided to close his zoo at his Neverland Valley Ranch in Los Olivos. Thriller died in June 2012 of lung cancer.

On December 3, 2007, Shambala Preserve made headlines when Chris Orr, a caretaker for the animals, was mauled by a tiger named Alexander. Several documentaries have focused on Shambala Preserve, including the 30-minute &quot;Lions: Kings of the Serengeti&quot; (1995), narrated by Melanie Griffith, and Animal Planet&#x27;s &quot;Life with Big Cats&quot; (1998), which won the Genesis Award for best documentary in 1999. The animals at the preserve served as the initial inspiration for the life&#x27;s work of artist A.E. London, who started her career working for Hedren. 

As of 2020, Hedren still maintains more than a dozen lions and tigers; her granddaughter Dakota Johnson is involved in their care.

==Personal life==

Hedren met future advertising executive Peter Griffith while doing a walk-on role on &quot;The Aldrich Family&quot;. On October 24, 1951, a day after Griffith turned 18, the couple took out a marriage license in New York, and were married the following year. The couple had one daughter, actress Melanie Griffith, born on August 9, 1957. They divorced in 1960, after which Hedren dated comedian Mort Sahl. On September 27, 1964, Hedren married her then-agent Noel Marshall, who later produced three of her films. The marriage came under strain during the filming of &quot;Roar&quot; and they divorced in 1982, with Hedren securing a restraining order forbidding Marshall from coming within 20 feet of her. On February 15, 1985, she married steel manufacturer Luis Barrenechea, but they divorced in 1992. According to Hedren, Barrenechea &quot;was everything I wanted in a man, except that he was an alcoholic and that was unbearable.&quot; Hedren was engaged to veterinarian Martin Dinnes from 2002 until their breakup in mid-2008. In September 2008, Hedren told &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m waiting for someone to sweep me off my feet.&quot; Hedren has three grandchildren, including actress Dakota Johnson.

Hedren played a role in the development of Vietnamese-American nail salons in the United States. In 1975, while an international relief coordinator with Food for the Hungry, she began visiting with refugees at Hope Village outside Sacramento, California. When she learned the women were interested in her manicured nails, she employed her nail technician to teach them the skills of the trade and worked with a local beauty school to help them find jobs. Hedren&#x27;s work with the Vietnamese-Americans was the subject of several documentaries: &quot;Happy Hands&quot;, directed by Honey Lauren, which won Best Documentary Short at the Sonoma International Film Festival in 2014; and &quot;Nailedit: Vietnamese and the Nail Industry&quot;, which won the Center for Asian American Media 2014 Documentary Fund Award. Creative Nail Design (CND) and the Beauty Changes Lives Foundation (BCL) created the BCL CND Tippi Hedren Nail Scholarship Fund to support professional nail education and it was administered starting January 1, 2014, until Fall 2017.

Hedren was instrumental in helping Kieu Chinh enter the US after the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Hedren arranged for an air ticket and a visa for Chinh and then invited her to stay in her house.

Hedren suffered from severe and persistent headaches for a long time, which rendered her unable to accept several projects, including a television series produced by and starring Betty White. After she got a titanium plate put in her neck, she improved and then agreed, with the blessing of her doctor, to take the part of a dying woman in the 2006 soap opera &quot;Fashion House&quot;. While she was rehearsing a scene, a gallon of water fell from the ceiling onto her head. The headaches returned after the incident and persisted. Hedren filed a suit to receive recompense following her inability to work. Hedren&#x27;s lawyer, Joseph Allen, made a mistake in his discussions with the defendants that allowed them to block him from filing suit. Hedren sued Allen for malpractice. In 2013, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Hedren had been awarded a $1.5 million settlement, including $213,400 for past lost earnings and $440,308 for future lost earnings, against her former lawyer. Hedren was hurt by the report since she had not collected the award. She gave an interview to explain that her former lawyer does not have the money to pay her, and discussed how the report put her in a difficult situation since her foundation was in dire need of funds. She explained that she has to raise $75,000 monthly just to keep it going. &quot;Chances are I won&#x27;t ever even see the money, and that&#x27;s what hurts so badly, that in all of this pain and suffering that publication ran with a swift and not researched story, which told people around the world who have been so gracious and thoughtful about sending donations, that I no longer needed them.&quot;

Hedren is a pescetarian.

In February 2024 it was reported that Hedren is suffering from dementia.

<doc id="287452" wikidata="Q222458" url="?curid=287452" title="Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby">
<text>Frederick Arthur Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby (15 January 1841 – 14 June 1908), known as Hon. Frederick Stanley until 1886 and Lord Stanley of Preston between 1886–1893, was a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom who served as Colonial Secretary from 1885 to 1886 and Governor General of Canada from 1888 to 1893. An avid sportsman, he built Stanley House Stables in England and is famous in North America for presenting Canada with the Stanley Cup, the championship trophy in ice hockey. Stanley was also one of the original inductees of the Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Stanley was born in St James&#x27;s Square, Westminster, the second surviving son of Edward Smith-Stanley, Lord Stanley, and the Hon. Emma Caroline, Lady Stanley, daughter of Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Baron Skelmersdale. He was educated at Harrow and Sandhurst. 

In 1851, his father succeeded as 14th Earl of Derby. The longest-serving leader of the Conservative Party (1846–68), the 14th Earl served as Prime Minister on three occasions, from February to December 1852, 1858–1859, and 1866–1868.

==Military career==

Stanley received a commission in the Grenadier Guards, rising to the rank of Captain before leaving the army for politics. He later served as Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the part-time 1st Royal Lancashire Militia (The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Own) from 23 June 1874 (though his political duties often kept him away from the regiment&#x27;s annual training) and became Honorary Colonel of its successor, the 3rd and 4th Battalions, King&#x27;s Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment), from 27 February 1886 until his death. He also followed his father and grandfather as Hon Colonel of the 1st Volunteer Battalion, King&#x27;s (Liverpool Regiment), being appointed on 15 January 1894. After his death he was succeeded in this appointment by his son in turn.

==Political career==
Stanley served as a Conservative Member of Parliament (for Preston from 1865 to 1868, North Lancashire from 1868 to 1885 and Blackpool from 1885 to 1886). In government, he served as a Civil Lord of the Admiralty (1868), Financial Secretary to the War Office (1874–1878), Secretary to the Treasury (1878), War Secretary (1878–1880) and Colonial Secretary (1885–1886). In 1886, he was created Baron Stanley of Preston, in the County Palatine of Lancaster. He served as President of the Board of Trade (1886–1888), remaining in that office until he was appointed Governor General of Canada.

Derby was a Freemason.

==Governor General of Canada==

Stanley was appointed the Governor General of Canada and Commander in Chief of Prince Edward Island on 1 May 1888. During his term as Governor General, he travelled often and widely throughout the country. His visit to western Canada in 1889 gave him a lasting appreciation of the region&#x27;s great natural beauty as well as permitting him to meet the people of Canada&#x27;s First Nations and many western ranchers and farmers. During his visit, he dedicated Stanley Park, which is named after him. He also experienced the joys of fishing and avidly pursued the sport whenever his busy schedule allowed. As governor general, Stanley was the third holder of that office to whom Queen Victoria granted the power of granting pardons to offenders or remitting sentences and fines and the power of mitigating capital or any other sentence.

When Prime Minister John A. Macdonald died in office of heart failure on 6 June 1891, Stanley lost the close friendship he had enjoyed with Macdonald. He asked John Abbott to take over as prime minister. Once the government was in place, Abbott resigned for health reasons and turned the government over to John Thompson. Stanley helped cement the non-political role of the governor general when, in 1891, he refused to agree to a controversial motion in the House of Commons. The motion called on him as governor general to disallow the government of Quebec&#x27;s &quot;Jesuit Estates Act&quot;, which authorized paying as compensation for land granted to the Jesuits by the King of France. The opposition to the bill was introduced by the other provinces who were motivated by mistrust of the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec. Stanley declined to interfere, citing the proposed disallowance as unconstitutional. In holding to this decision, he gained popularity by refusing to compromise the viceregal position of political neutrality.

Stanley&#x27;s wife, whom Wilfrid Laurier described as &quot;an able and witty woman&quot;, made a lasting contribution during her husband&#x27;s term of office. In 1891, she founded the Lady Stanley Institute for Trained Nurses on Rideau Street, the first nursing school in Ottawa. She was also an enthusiastic fan of hockey games at the Rideau Rink.

==Stanley Cup==
Stanley&#x27;s sons became avid ice hockey players in Canada, playing in amateur leagues in Ottawa, and Lord and Lady Stanley became staunch hockey fans. In 1892, Stanley bequeathed to Canada a trophy today named in his honour as the Stanley Cup, known originally as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup. He originally donated the trophy as a challenge cup for Canada&#x27;s best amateur hockey club, but in 1909, it became contested for by professional teams exclusively. Since 1926, only teams of the National Hockey League have competed for the trophy. This now-famous cup bears his name as a tribute to his encouragement and love of outdoor life and sport in Canada and in recognition, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1945 in the &quot;Honoured Builders&quot; category. The original size of the trophy was and is now around and weighs .

==Later years==

Stanley&#x27;s term as Governor General of Canada was due to end in September 1893 but in April of that year, his elder brother, the 15th Earl of Derby, died. Stanley succeeded him as the 16th Earl of Derby. As a result, Stanley, now known as Lord Derby, left Canada on 15 July 1893 and returned to England. An administrator was appointed to fulfil his duties until Lord Aberdeen was sworn in that September.

Also in 1893, Toronto&#x27;s &quot;New Fort York&quot; (built in 1841) was renamed The Stanley Barracks in honour of Lord Stanley. Back with his family in England, he soon became the Lord Mayor of Liverpool and the first Chancellor of the University of Liverpool. Stanley Park, Liverpool is also named after him. In November 1901 Lord Derby was elected Mayor of Preston for the following year, and took part in the 1902 Preston Guild. He later received the honorary freedom of the borough of Preston, with which his family had been associated for centuries.

During the last years of his life, he increasingly dedicated himself to philanthropic work. He was founder president of the committee for the building of Liverpool Cathedral in 1901, and helped fund the Coronation Park, Ormskirk, in 1905.

==Marriage and issue==
Derby married Lady Constance Villiers, daughter of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon, on 31 May 1864. She was born in 1840. They had eight sons and two daughters:

* Edward George Villiers Stanley (1865–1948), who succeeded his father as 17th Earl of Derby.
* Hon. Sir Victor Albert Stanley (1867–1934), was an Admiral in the Royal Navy who married a Canadian lady, the daughter of Hon. C. E. Pooley, KC, of British Columbia. 
* Katharine Mary Stanley (21 April 1868 – 21 October 1871), died in childhood
* Hon. Sir Arthur Stanley (1869–1947), twin
* Geoffrey Stanley (18 November 1869 – 16 March 1871), twin, died in childhood
* Hon. Ferdinand Charles Stanley (28 January 1871 – 17 March 1935), was educated at Wellington and Sandhurst, before joining the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps in 1891, rising to the rank of Brigadier-General. He married the Hon. Alexandra Fellowes, the eldest daughter of William Henry Fellowes, Baron de Ramsey; they lived at 8 Cornwall Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park, London, now renamed Stanley House.
* Lt.-Col. Rt. Hon. Sir George Frederick Stanley (1872–1938), Royal Horse Artillery, MP, junior minister and Governor of Madras. Married Lady Beatrix Taylour (died 1944), daughter of Thomas Taylour, 3rd Marquess of Headfort; they had a daughter.
* Hon. Col. Algernon Francis Stanley (8 January 1874 – 10 February 1962), married the widow Mary Cavendish Crichton (her late husband Lt-Col. Henry William, son of John Crichton, 4th Earl Erne was KIA in 1914 on the Western Front), daughter of Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster. They had one son and a daughter.
*Lady Isobel Gathorne-Hardy (1875–1963), who was instrumental in convincing her father to create the Stanley Cup. She is mentioned in one of the first games of women&#x27;s hockey, played at Rideau Skating Rink in 1899. Her role as a women&#x27;s hockey pioneer is recognized in women&#x27;s hockey with both the Isobel Gathorne-Hardy Award, given across women&#x27;s hockey in Canada, and the Isobel Cup, the Premier Hockey Federation&#x27;s championship trophy.
* Lt.-Col. Hon. Frederick William Stanley (27 May 1878 – 9 August 1942), married Lady Alexandra Louise Elizabeth Acheson, the daughter of Archibald Acheson, 4th Earl of Gosford and Louisa Acheson, Countess of Gosford on 17 June 1905. They had one son and two daughters, one of whom married the son of Lieutenant-General Sir George Sidney Clive. He would go on to serve and be wounded in the Second Boer War, and later the First World War.

Her Ladyship remained and several of their children lived in Canada throughout his term as Governor-General. She was responsible for the foundation of the Lady Stanley Institute for Trained Nurses in Ottawa, Ontario, as well as a Maternity Hospital. She was president of the $4,000 fund instituted by the women of Canada for the presentation of a wedding gift to the present Prince and Princess of Wales: a sleigh, robes, harnesses and horses and a canoe. In 1890 Prince George of Wales (the future King George V) was their guest at Rideau Hall. In 1903 King Edward VII was their guest at their residence in St James&#x27;s Square.

Derby died on 14 June 1908, aged 67, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward, who also became a distinguished politician. Lady Derby died on 17 April 1922.

==Legacy==
After Edward Whymper made the first ascent of Stanley Peak in 1901, he named the mountain after Lord Derby. Vancouver&#x27;s Stanley Park and Stanley Theatre were also named after him, as was Stanley Park, Blackpool.

The Preston Squadron of cadets at the Royal Military College Saint-Jean was named in his honour. Stanley Park, Liverpool, an area that famously separates Anfield and Goodison Park, the home grounds of English Premier League football teams Liverpool F.C. and Everton F.C., was named after him. Stanley House Inn, named for Lord Stanley and was built as his summer residence in 1888 along the Cascapedia River.

The Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup is today known as the Stanley Cup and is awarded to the winning team of the National Hockey League playoffs each season. In October 2017, Lord Stanley&#x27;s Gift Monument was erected in Ottawa at Sparks Street and Elgin Street, near the location of the dinner party announcing the Cup at the Russell House, which has since been demolished.

Stanley Quay, later renamed Stanley Street, in Brisbane, Australia, was named after him when he was Colonial Secretary.

<doc id="287453" wikidata="Q238539" url="?curid=287453" title="Fawzia of Egypt">
<text>Fawzia of Egypt (; 5 November 1921 – 2 July 2013), also known as Fawzia Pahlavi or Fawzia Chirine, was an Egyptian princess who became Queen of Iran as the first wife of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran. Fawzia was the daughter of Fuad I, seventh son of Ismail the Magnificent. Her marriage to the Iranian Crown Prince in 1939 was a political deal: it consolidated Egyptian power and influence in the Middle East, while bringing respectability to the new Iranian regime by association with the much more prestigious Egyptian royal house. Fawzia obtained an Egyptian divorce in 1948, under which their one daughter Princess Shahnaz would be brought up in Iran. Fawzia, who was known as the &quot;sad queen&quot; in the press, lived in isolation and silence after the 1952 Egyptian revolution and never published her memories of the court of Iran and Egypt.

In 1949, Fawzia married Colonel Ismail Chirine, an Egyptian diplomat, with whom she had a son and a daughter.

==Early life and education==
Princess Fawzia was born &quot;Her Sultanic Highness&quot; Princess Fawzia bint Fuad at Ras el-Tin Palace, Alexandria, the eldest daughter of Sultan Fuad I of Egypt and Sudan (later King Fuad I), and his second wife, Nazli Sabri on 5 November 1921. Princess Fawzia was of Albanian and Circassian descent from her father&#x27;s side, and French and Egyptian descent from her mother. Her mother&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Major General Mohamed Sherif Pasha, prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, who was of Turkish-Circassian origin. She was the great-great-granddaughter of Muhammad Ali of Egypt as well as the great-granddaughter of the French-born officer Suleiman Pasha. Suleiman Pasha served under Napoleon, converted to Islam, and oversaw an overhaul of the Egyptian army under her great-great-grandfather Muhammad Ali Pasha the Great.

In addition to her sisters, Faiza, Faika and Fathia, and her brother, Farouk, she had two half-siblings, Fawkia and Ismail, from her father&#x27;s previous marriage to Princess Shwikar Khanum Effendi. Princess Fawzia was fluent in English and French in addition to her native Arabic.

Her beauty was often compared to that of film stars Hedy Lamarr and Vivien Leigh.

==Marriage==
The marriage of Princess Fawzia to Iran&#x27;s Crown Prince Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was planned by the latter&#x27;s father, Rezā Shāh. A declassified CIA report in May 1972 described the union as a political move. The marriage was also significant in that it united a Sunni royal, the princess, and a Shia royal, the crown prince. The Pahlavis were a parvenu house as Reza Khan, the son of a peasant who entered the Iranian Army as a private, rising up to become a general, had seized power in a 1921 coup. He was most anxious to have the House of Pahlavi married to the House of Muhammad Ali, which had reigned over Egypt since 1805.

The Egyptians were not impressed with the gifts sent by Reza Shah to King Farouk to persuade him to marry his sister to the prince Mohammad Reza. When an Iranian delegation arrived in Cairo to arrange the marriage, the Egyptians took the Iranians on a tour of the palaces built by Isma&#x27;il Pasha, known as &quot;Isma&#x27;il the Magnificent&quot;, to show them proper royal splendor. King Farouk was not initially interested in marrying off his sister to the Crown Prince of Iran, but Aly Maher Pasha, the king&#x27;s favorite political adviser, persuaded him that a marriage alliance with Iran would improve Egypt&#x27;s position within the Islamic world and against Britain. At the same time, Maher Pasha was working on plans to marry off Farouk&#x27;s other sisters to King Faisal II of Iraq and to the son of Emir Abdullah of Jordan, intending to forge an Egyptian-dominated bloc in the Middle East. To prepare for life in Iran, Fawzia was assigned a tutor to teach her Persian.  

Fawzia and Pahlavi were engaged in May 1938. However, they saw each other only once before their wedding. They married at the Abdeen Palace in Cairo on 15 March 1939. King Farouk took the couple on a tour of Egypt, showing them the pyramids, Al-Azhar University, and other famous sites. The contrast between the Crown Prince Mohammad Reza, dressed in the simple uniform of an Iranian officer, and the lavish opulence of the Egyptian court typified by the famously free-spending Farouk in his expensive suits, was much remarked upon at the time. After the wedding, King Farouk had a twenty-course meal to celebrate the nuptials at the Abdeen Palace. At the time Prince Mohammad Reza lived in awe of his overbearing father, Reza Shah, and was dominated by Farouk, who was considerably more self-confident. Afterwards, Fawzia departed for Iran together with her mother, Queen Nazli, on a train trip that saw the electricity break down several times, causing the two women to feel like they were going on a camping trip.  

When they returned to Iran the wedding ceremony was repeated at the Marble Palace, Tehran, which was also their future residence. As Mohammad Reza spoke no Turkish (one of the languages of the Egyptian elite, the other being French) and Fawzia was described as being only &quot;competent&quot; in Persian, the two talked to each other in French, in which both were fluent. Upon arriving in Tehran, Reza Shah had the main streets of Tehran decorated with banners and arches, and had a celebration at the Amjadieh stadium attended by 25,000 of the Iranian elite with synchronized acrobatics by students being followed by &quot;bastani&quot; (Iranian calisthenics), fencing, and football. The wedding dinner was a French-style dinner with &quot;caviar from the Caspian Sea&quot;, &quot;Consommé Royal&quot;, fish, fowl and lamb. Fawzia disliked Reza Khan, whom she described as a violent and thuggish man prone to attacking people with either his whip or riding crop. In contrast to the French food she had grown up with in Egypt, Fawzia found the food at the Iranian court sub-par. In the same way, Fawzia found that the palaces of Iran could not be compared to the palaces that she had grown up in Egypt.

==Queen of Iran==
Following the marriage, the Princess was granted Iranian nationality. Two years later the crown prince succeeded his exiled father and was to become the Shah of Iran. Soon after her husband&#x27;s ascent to the throne, Queen Fawzia appeared on the cover of the 21 September 1942, issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, photographed by Cecil Beaton, who described her as an &quot;Asian Venus&quot; with &quot;a perfect heart-shaped face and strangely pale but piercing blue eyes.&quot; She led the newly founded Association for the Protection of Pregnant Women and Children (APPWC) in Iran.

With Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, she had one child, a daughter:
* HIH Princess Shahnaz Pahlavi (born 27 October 1940).

The marriage was a failure. Fawzia was deeply unhappy in Iran, and often missed her homeland of Egypt. Fawzia&#x27;s relations with her mother-in-law and her sisters-in-law were notably tempestuous as the Queen Mother and her daughters saw her as a rival for Mohammad Reza Shah&#x27;s affections, and the women constantly feuded with each other. One of Mohammad Reza&#x27;s sisters broke a vase over Fawzia&#x27;s head. The womanizing Mohammad Reza Shah was frequently unfaithful to Fawzia, and was often seen driving around with other women in Tehran from 1940 onward. Popular rumor had it that Fawzia for her part had an affair with her minder, described as an athletic, handsome man, though her friends insist that this was merely malicious gossip. Fawzia&#x27;s son-in-law, Ardeshir Zahedi told the Iranian-American historian Abbas Milani in a 2009 interview about the rumors: &quot;She is a lady and never veered from the path of purity and fidelity&quot;. From 1944 onward, Fawzia was treated for depression by an American psychiatrist, as she stated her marriage was a loveless one and she desperately wanted to go back to Egypt.

Queen Fawzia (the title of empress was not yet used in Iran at that time) moved to Cairo in May 1945 and obtained an Egyptian divorce. The reason for her return was that she viewed Tehran as underdeveloped in contrast to modern, cosmopolitan Cairo. She consulted an American psychiatrist in Baghdad for her troubles shortly before she left Tehran. On the other hand, CIA reports claim that Princess Fawzia ridiculed and humiliated the Shah due to his supposed impotence, leading to their separation. In her book Ashraf Pahlavi, twin sister of the Shah, argues that it was the Princess not the Shah who asked for divorce. Fawzia left Iran for Egypt, and despite numerous attempts on the part of the Shah to persuade her to return, she remained put in Cairo. Mohammad Reza told the British ambassador in 1945 that his mother was &quot;probably the main obstacle to the return of the Queen&quot;.

This divorce was first not recognized for several years by Iran, but eventually an official divorce was obtained in Iran, on 17 November 1948, with Queen Fawzia successfully reclaiming her previous distinction of Princess of Egypt as well. A major condition of the divorce was that her daughter be left behind to be raised in Iran. Incidentally, Queen Fawzia&#x27;s brother, King Farouk, also divorced his first wife, Queen Farida, in November 1948.

In the official announcement of the divorce, it was stated that &quot;the Persian climate had endangered the health of Queen Fawzia, and that thus it was agreed that the Egyptian King&#x27;s sister be divorced.&quot; In another official statement, the Shah said that the dissolution of the marriage &quot;cannot affect by any means the existing friendly relations between Egypt and Iran.&quot; After her divorce Princess Fawzia headed the Egyptian court.

==Later life==
On 28 March 1949, at the Koubba Palace in Cairo, Princess Fawzia married Colonel Ismail Chirine (or Shirin) (1919–1994), who was the eldest son of Hussein Chirine Bey and his wife, HH Princess Amina Bihruz Khanum Effendi. He was a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, and a one-time Egyptian minister of war and the navy. Following the wedding they lived in an estate owned by the Princess in Maadi, Cairo. They also resided in a villa in Smouha, Alexandria. Unlike her first marriage, this time Fawzia married for love and she was described as far happier being married to Colonel Chirine than she ever had been to the Shah of Iran.

They had two children, one daughter and one son:
* Nadia Chirine (19 December 1950, Cairo – October 2009). She married firstly (and divorced) Yusuf Shabaan, an Egyptian actor. Her second husband was Mustafa Rashid. She had two daughters, one with each husband:
** Sinai Shabaan (born October 1973)
** Fawzia Rashid
* Hussein Chirine (1955–2016)

Fawzia lived in Egypt after the 1952 Revolution that toppled King Farouk. Princess Fawzia&#x27;s death was mistakenly reported in January 2005. Journalists had confused her with her niece, Princess Fawzia Farouk (1940–2005), one of the three daughters of King Farouk.

==Death==
In her later life, Princess Fawzia lived in Alexandria, where she died on 2 July 2013 at the age of 91. Her funeral ceremony was held after noon prayers at Sayeda Nafisa Mosque in Cairo on 3 July. She was buried in Cairo next to her second husband. At her death, she was the oldest member of the deposed Muhammad Ali dynasty residing in Egypt.

==Legacy==
A town in Iran, Fawziabad, was named for Princess Fawzia in 1939. A street in Maadi, Cairo, was again named for her in 1950 as Amira Fawzia street, but in 1956 it was renamed as Mustafa Kamel street.

* : Grand Cordon of the Order of Khorshid (27 October 1940)

<text>Rodney Sturt Taylor (11 January 1930 – 7 January 2015) was an Australian actor. He appeared in more than 50 feature films, including &quot;Young Cassidy&quot; (1965), &quot;Nobody Runs Forever&quot; (1968), &quot;The Train Robbers&quot; (1973), and &quot;A Matter of Wife... and Death&quot; (1975).

Taylor was born in Lidcombe, a suburb of Sydney, to a father who was a steel construction contractor and commercial artist and a mother who was a children&#x27;s author. He began taking art classes in high school, and continued in college. He decided to become an actor after seeing Laurence Olivier in an Old Vic touring production of &quot;Richard III.&quot;

His first film role was in a re-enactment of Charles Sturt&#x27;s voyage down the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers, playing Sturt&#x27;s offsider, George Macleay. At the time, he was also appearing in a number of theatre productions for Australia&#x27;s Mercury Theatre. He made his feature film debut in the Australian Lee Robinson film &quot;King of the Coral Sea&quot; (1954). He soon started acting in television films, portraying several different characters in the 1950s anthology series &quot;Studio 57&quot;.

He started to gain popularity after starring in &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1960), as H. George Wells. He later starred in the Disney film &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (1961), voicing Pongo. In one of his most famous roles, he played Mitch Brenner in &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963), directed by Alfred Hitchcock. By the late 1990s, Taylor had moved into semiretirement. His final film role was in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; (2009), portraying Winston Churchill in a cameo.

==Early life==
Taylor was born on 11 January 1930 in Lidcombe, a suburb of Sydney, the only child of William Sturt Taylor, a steel construction contractor and commercial artist, and Mona Taylor (née Thompson), a writer of more than a hundred short stories and children&#x27;s books. His middle name comes from his great-great-granduncle, Captain Charles Sturt, a British explorer of the Australian outback in the 19th century.

Taylor attended Parramatta High School and later studied at the East Sydney Technical and Fine Arts College and took art classes. His mother wanted him to be an artist, and pressured him into taking the art classes. For a time he worked as a commercial artist, but he decided to become an actor after seeing Laurence Olivier in an Old Vic touring production of &quot;Richard III&quot;.

==Career==

===Australia===
Taylor acquired extensive radio and stage experience in Australia, where his radio work included a period on &quot;Blue Hills&quot; and a role as Tarzan. Earlier in his career, he had to support himself by working at Sydney&#x27;s Mark Foy&#x27;s department store, designing and painting window and other displays during the day. In 1951, he took part in a re-enactment of Charles Sturt&#x27;s voyage down the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers, playing Sturt&#x27;s offsider, George Macleay. A short documentary, &quot;Inland with Sturt&quot; (1951), was based on it. Taylor also appeared in a number of theatre productions for Australia&#x27;s Mercury Theatre.

Taylor made his feature-film debut in the Australian Lee Robinson film &quot;King of the Coral Sea&quot; (1954), playing an American. He later played Israel Hands in a Hollywood-financed film shot in Sydney, &quot;Long John Silver&quot; (1954), an unofficial sequel to &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. Following these two films, Taylor was awarded the 1954 Rola Show Australian Radio Actor of the Year Award, which included a ticket to London via Los Angeles, but Taylor did not continue on to London.

===Hollywood===

Taylor soon landed roles in television shows such as &quot;Studio 57&quot; and the films &quot;Hell on Frisco Bay&quot; (1955) and &quot;Giant&quot; (1956). In 1955, he guest-starred as Clancy in the third episode (&quot;The Argonauts&quot;) of the first hour-long Western television series, &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, an ABC program starring Clint Walker.

Toward the end of 1955, Taylor unsuccessfully screen tested to play boxer Rocky Graziano in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; after James Dean&#x27;s death, but his use of a Brooklyn accent and physical prowess in the test impressed the studio enough to give him a long-term contract. At MGM, he played a series of supporting roles in &quot;The Catered Affair&quot; (1956), &quot;Raintree County&quot; (1957), and &quot;Ask Any Girl&quot; (1959). He had a significant role in &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1958), which won Oscars for two of its stars, David Niven and Wendy Hiller. He also made a strong impression guest-starring in an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; titled &quot;And When the Sky Was Opened&quot; (1959).

===Stardom===
Taylor&#x27;s first leading role in a feature film was in &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1960), George Pal&#x27;s adaptation of the science-fiction classic by H. G. Wells, with Taylor as the time traveller who, thousands of years in the future, falls for a woman played by Yvette Mimieux. Taylor played a character not unlike that of his &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode of a year earlier and the film &quot;World Without End&quot; in 1956.

In or around 1960, he was approached regarding the role of James Bond in the first feature-length Bond film. Taylor reportedly declined to become involved because he considered the character of Bond &quot;beneath him&quot;. Taylor later commented: &quot;Every time a new Bond picture became a smash hit ... I tore out my hair.&quot;

Taylor starred in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s horror thriller &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963), along with Tippi Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy, and Veronica Cartwright, playing a man whose town and home come under attack by menacing birds. Taylor then starred with Jane Fonda in the romantic comedy &quot;Sunday in New York&quot; (also 1963).

During the mid-1960s, Taylor worked mostly for MGM. His credits including &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot; (1963), his first feature-film role as an Australian, with Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, and Maggie Smith; &quot;Fate Is the Hunter&quot; (for 20th Century Fox, 1964) with Glenn Ford and Suzanne Pleshette; &quot;36 Hours&quot; (1964) with James Garner; &quot;Young Cassidy&quot; (1965) with Julie Christie and Maggie Smith; &quot;The Liquidator&quot; (1965) with Jill St. John; &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; (1965); and &quot;The Glass Bottom Boat&quot; (1966), both co-starring Doris Day.

He began to change his image toward the end of the decade to more tough-guy roles, such as &quot;Chuka&quot; (1967), which he also produced, and he starred in &quot;Hotel&quot; (1967) with Catherine Spaak; &quot;Dark of the Sun&quot; (or &quot;The Mercenaries&quot;, 1968), again with Yvette Mimieux; &quot;Nobody Runs Forever&quot; (1968) in which he played New South Wales Police Sergeant Scobie Malone, this being Taylor&#x27;s first starring feature-film role as an Australian; and &quot;Darker than Amber&quot; (1970) as Travis McGee.

He was also reportedly up for the role of martial artist Roper in the Bruce Lee vehicle &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973). The film was directed by Robert Clouse, who had also directed Taylor in &quot;Darker than Amber&quot;. Taylor was supposedly deemed too tall for the part, and the role instead went to John Saxon.

===Later career===
In 1973, Taylor was cast in &quot;The Train Robbers&quot; alongside long-time friend John Wayne and Ann-Margret. The film was a box-office success. Taylor also had some television roles: he starred in &quot;Bearcats!&quot; (1971) on CBS and in &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; (1976) on NBC. He had a regular role in the short-lived spy drama series &quot;Masquerade&quot; (1983), and played one of the leads in the equally short-lived series, &quot;Outlaws&quot; (1986). From 1988 to 1990, Taylor appeared in the CBS drama series &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; as Frank Agretti, playing opposite Jane Wyman. In the mid-1990s, he appeared in several episodes of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;.

In 1993, he hosted the documentary &quot;Time Machine: The Journey Back&quot;. The special ended with a minisequel written by David Duncan, the screenwriter of the George Pal film. Taylor recreated his role as George, reuniting him with Filby (Alan Young).

Taylor returned to Australia several times over the years to make films, playing a 1920s traveling showman in &quot;The Picture Show Man&quot; (1977) and a paid killer in &quot;On the Run&quot; (1983). In the black comedy &quot;Welcome to Woop Woop&quot; (1997), he played the foul-mouthed redneck Daddy-O.

By the late 1990s, Taylor had moved into semiretirement. In 2007, he appeared in the horror telemovie &quot;Kaw&quot;, which revisits the idea of marauding birds turning on their human tormentors. In this film, however, the cause of the disturbance was discovered by Taylor, who plays the town doctor. He appeared in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; in 2009, portraying Winston Churchill in a cameo. In 2017, a documentary on Taylor&#x27;s life, &quot;Pulling No Punches&quot;, was released and entered into the Beverly Hills Film Festival.

==Personal life==
His first wife was model Peggy Williams (1951–1954). They divorced after allegations of domestic violence. Taylor later claimed that they divorced because they felt they were too young to have a healthy marriage. Taylor dated and was briefly engaged to Swedish actress Anita Ekberg in the early 1960s. He dated model Pat Sheehan in the late 1960s.

His second marriage to model Mary Hilem lasted from 1963 until they divorced in 1969. The couple had one daughter, former CNN financial reporter Felicia Taylor (1964-2023). Taylor bought a home in Palm Springs, California, in 1967.

He married his third wife, Carol Kikumura, in 1980. They had originally dated in the early 1960s when she was an extra on his TV series &quot;Hong Kong&quot;. The couple got back together in 1971 and dated for an additional nine years before marrying.

==Death==
Taylor died of a heart attack at his home, surrounded by his family, on 7 January 2015, in Beverly Hills, California, four days before his 85th birthday.

<doc id="287459" wikidata="Q193152" url="?curid=287459" title="Great Moravia">
<text>Great Moravia (; , &quot;Meghálī Moravía&quot;; ; ; , ), or simply Moravia, was the first major state that was predominantly West Slavic to emerge in the area of Central Europe, possibly including territories which are today part of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Serbia, Ukraine and Slovenia. The formations preceding it in these territories were Samo&#x27;s tribal union (631–658) and the Pannonian Avar state (567 – after 822).

Its core territory is the region now called Moravia in the eastern part of the Czech Republic alongside the Morava River, which gave its name to the kingdom. The kingdom saw the rise of the first ever Slavic literary culture in the Old Church Slavonic language as well as the expansion of Christianity, first via missionaries from East Francia, and later after the arrival of Saints Cyril and Methodius in 863 and the creation of the Glagolitic alphabet, the first alphabet dedicated to a Slavic language. Glagolitic was subsequently replaced by the Cyrillic alphabet created in the First Bulgarian Empire.

Although the borders of this empire cannot be exactly determined, Moravia reached its largest territorial extent under prince Svatopluk I (), who ruled from 870 to 894. Separatism and internal conflicts emerging after Svatopluk&#x27;s death contributed to the fall of Great Moravia, which was overrun by the Hungarians, who then included the territory of present-day Slovakia in their domains. The exact date of Moravia&#x27;s collapse is unknown, but it occurred between 902 and 907.

Moravia experienced significant cultural development under King Rastislav, with the arrival in 863 of the mission of Saints Cyril and Methodius. After his request for missionaries had been refused in Rome, Rastislav asked the Byzantine emperor to send a &quot;teacher&quot; (učiteľ) to introduce literacy and a legal system (pravьda) to Great Moravia. The request was granted. The missionary brothers Cyril and Methodius introduced a system of writing (the Glagolitic alphabet) and Slavonic liturgy, the latter eventually formally approved by Pope Adrian II. The Glagolitic script was probably invented by Cyril himself and the language he used for his translations of religious texts and his original literary creation was based on the Eastern South Slavic dialect he and his brother Methodius knew from their native Thessaloniki. Old Church Slavonic, therefore, differed somewhat from the local Slavic dialect of Great Moravia which was the ancestral idiom to the later dialects spoken in Moravia and western Slovakia. Later, the disciples of Cyril and Methodius were expelled from Great Moravia by King Svatopluk I, who re-orientated the Empire to Western Christianity.

==Name==
===Great Moravia===
The meaning of the name of Great Moravia has been subject to debate. The designation &quot;Great Moravia&quot;—&quot;Megale Moravia&quot; () in Greek—stems from the work &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; written by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos around 950. The emperor only used the adjective &quot;megale&quot; in connection with the polity when referring to events that occurred after its fall, implying that it should rather be translated as &quot;old&quot; instead of &quot;great&quot;. According to a third theory, the &quot;megale&quot; adjective refers to a territory located beyond the borders of the Byzantine Empire. Finally, the historian Lubomír E. Havlík writes that Byzantine scholars used this adjective when referring to homelands of nomadic peoples, as demonstrated by the term &quot;Great Bulgaria&quot;.

The work of Porphyrogenitos is the only nearly contemporaneous source using the adjective &quot;great&quot; in connection with Moravia. Other documents from the 9th and 10th centuries never used the term in this context. Instead they mention the polity as &quot;Moravian realm&quot; or &quot;realm of Moravians&quot; (&quot;regnum Marahensium&quot;, &quot;terra Marahensium&quot;, &quot;regnum Marahavorum&quot;, &quot;regnum Marauorum&quot;, &quot;terra Marauorum&quot; or &quot;regnum Margorum&quot; in Latin, and &quot;Moravьska oblastь&quot; in Old Church Slavonic), simply &quot;Moravia&quot; (&quot;Marawa&quot;, &quot;Marauia&quot;, and &quot;Maraha&quot; in Latin, &quot;Morava&quot;, &quot;Marava&quot;, or &quot;Murava&quot; in Old Church Slavonic, and &quot;M.ŕawa.t&quot; in Arabic), also &quot;regnum Sclavorum&quot; (&quot;realm of Slavs&quot;) or alternate &quot;regnum Rastizi&quot; (&quot;realm of Rastislav&quot;) or &quot;regnum Zuentibaldi&quot; (&quot;realm of Svatopluk&quot;).

===Etymology===
&quot;Morava&quot; is the Czech and Slovak name for both the river and the country, presumably the river name being primary and giving name to the surrounding country. The ending -ava, as in many other Czech and Slovak rivers, is most often regarded as Slavicization of the originally Germanic -ahwa (= modern German &quot;Au&quot; or &quot;-a&quot;), cognate to Latin aqua. Some scholars again link it, via Celtic -ab, to Indo-European PIE &quot;*apa&quot;/&quot;*opa&quot; (&quot;water, sea&quot;). The root mor- might be also connected with other Indo-European words with the meaning of water, lake or sea (sea: Slavic more, Latin mare, Welsh môr, German Meer; humidity: English and German Moor, Slavic ). Compare also other river names like Mur in Austria and another Morava in Serbia, etc.).

==Territory==
After the fall of Great Moravia, the central territory of Great Moravia was gradually divided into the newly ascending Kingdom of Bohemia and Hungarian Kingdom. The frontier was originally settled on the Morava river. However, from the 12th century, the Czech kings managed to gain more and more of the region on the eastern bank, eventually gaining the whole stretch of the eastern territory from Uherské Hradiště down to Strážnice along the White Carpathians. The original core territory of Great Moravia, nowadays forming the eastern part of Moravia and situated between the White Carpathians and the Chřiby mountains, has retained its non-Czech identity in its designation &quot;Slovácko&quot; which shows common origins with the name of the neighbouring Slovakia—a token of a past shared identity in Great Moravian times. This core region of Great Moravia along the river has retained a unique culture with a rich folklore tradition: the above-mentioned Slovácko stretches, to the south (where the Morava river forms the Czech-Slovak frontier), into two regions—the Podluží region on the Morava&#x27;s western (Czech) bank and Záhorie on its eastern (Slovak) bank. Záhorie also boasts the only surviving building from Great Moravian times, the chapel at Kopčany just across the Morava from the archaeological site of Mikulčice (these two important Great Moravian places are now connected by a bridge). The core of Great Moravia was extended, according to annals, in the early 830s, when Mojmir I of Moravia conquered the neighbouring principality of Nitra (present-day western Slovakia). The former principality of Nitra was used as what is termed in Slovak &quot;údelné kniežatsvo&quot;, or the territory given to and ruled by the successor to the throne, traditionally the ruling kъnendzь (Prince)&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son.
Nevertheless, the extent, and even the very location of Great Moravia (historiographical terms, as its original formal name is unknown) are a subject of debate. Rival theories place its centre south of the Danube (the Morava in Serbia) or on the Great Hungarian Plain. The exact date when the Moravian state was founded is also disputed, but it probably occurred in the early 830s under Prince Mojmír I (820s/830s–846), the first known ruler of the united Moravia. Mojmír and his successor, Rastislav (&quot;Rostislav&quot; in Czech), who ruled from 846 to 870, initially acknowledged the suzerainty of the Carolingian monarchs, but the Moravian fight for independence caused a series of armed conflicts with East Francia from the 840s.

=== Traditional view ===

According to most historians, the core territories of Moravia were located in the valley of the river Morava, today in present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia. Archaeological findings of large early medieval fortresses and the significant cluster of settlements growing around them suggest that an important centre of power emerged in this region in the 9th century. Early sources (Alfred the Great&#x27;s contemporaneous translation of Orosius&#x27;s &quot;History of the World&quot;, which mentioned Moravia&#x27;s neighbours, and the description of the travel of Cyril and Methodius from Moravia to Venice through Pannonia in the &quot;Life of Cyril&quot;) also substantiate the traditional view.

The borders of Moravia cannot exactly be determined because of the lack of accurate contemporaneous sources. For instance, the monks writing the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot; in the 9th century obviously had limited knowledge of the geography of distant regions of Central Europe. Furthermore, Moravian monarchs adopted an expansionist policy in the 830s, thus the borders of their realm often changed.

Moravia reached the peak of its territorial expansion under Svatopluk I (870–894). Lesser Poland, Pannonia and other regions were forced to accept, at least formally and often only for a short period, his suzerainty. On the other hand, the existence of the archaeologically attested shared cultural zones between Moravia, Lesser Poland and Silesia do not prove that the northern boundaries of Moravia were located over these territories. According to archaeologist Béla Miklós Szőke, the comitatus of Mosaburg in Pannonia was never part of Moravia. Neither archaeological finds nor written sources substantiate the traditional view of the permanent annexation of huge territories in his reign. Other scholars warn that it&#x27;s a mistake to draw the boundaries of core territories because Moravia did not reach that development level.

=== Further theories ===
In 1784, Slovak historian Juraj Sklenár disputed the traditional view on the location of Moravia and placed its core region in the region of Syrmia, stating that it spread from that location to the north to present-day Slovakia, Moravia and Bohemia. Similarly, in the 1820s, Friedrich Blumenerger placed Great Moravia to the south on the borders of Pannonia and Moesia. Their views remained isolated until the 1970s, when Imre Boba again published a theory that Moravia&#x27;s core territory must have been located around Sirmium, near the river Great Morava. Péter Püspöki-Nagy proposed the existence of two Moravias: a &quot;Great&quot; Moravia at the southern Morava river in present-day Serbia, and another Moravia on the northern Morava river in present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia. A similar theory was also published by Toru Senga. In the 1990s, the southern thesis was further developed by Charles Bowlus, who wrote that Moravia emerged in the region of the &quot;confluences of the Drava, Sava, Drina, Tisza and southern Morava rivers with the Danube&quot;. Bowlus emphasized that the orientation of the Frankish marcher organization was focused on the south-east territories, which also supports Great Moravia&#x27;s southern position. Martin Eggers suggested the original location of Moravia was centered around modern Banat at the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Mureș (&#x27;Moriš&#x27; in Serbian), with further expansions extending to the territories in present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia.

==History==

===Origins (before c. 800)===

The earliest possible reference to Slavic tribes living in the valley of the northern Morava river was made by the Byzantine historian Procopius. He wrote of a group of Germanic Heruli who &quot;passed through the territory of all of the Sclavenes&quot; while moving towards Denmark in 512. Archaeological sites have yielded hand-made ceramics, and closely analogous objects in southern Poland and western Ukraine appeared at the confluence of the northern Morava River and the Middle Danube, dated to around 550.

Large territories in the Pannonian Basin were conquered after 568 by the nomadic Avars who had arrived from the Eurasian Steppes. The Slavs were forced to pay tribute to the Avars and to participate in their raids against the Byzantine Empire, the Franks and the Lombards. Even though the Avar settlement area stabilized on the Danube river in the early period of the khaganate (southern border of present-day Slovakia), a smaller (southernmost) part came under their direct military control after the fall of Samo&#x27;s empire. In the late period of the khaganate, the Avars had already inclined to a more settled lifestyle and their co-existence with the local Slavs can be already characterized as some kind of cultural symbiosis.

In the 7th and 8th centuries, the development of the local Slavs accelerated. The first Slavic fortified settlements were built in present-day Moravia as early as the last decades of the 7th century. From the end of the 7th century, it is possible to register the rise of a new social elite in Moravia, Slovakia and Bohemia—the warrior horsemen. The social organization of the local Slavs continued to grow during the 8th century, which can be documented by further building and development of fortified settlements. In Moravia, they unambiguously concentrate around the river Morava. In Slovakia, the oldest Slavic fortified settlements are documented for the last decades of the 8th century. They were exclusively in areas which were not under direct Avar influence, but probably not built only as protection against them, because some of them are also found in northern territories (Orava, Spiš). Variation in pottery implies the existence of at least three tribes inhabiting the wider region of the northern Morava river in the early 9th century. Settlement complexes from the period were unearthed, for instance, near modern Bratislava, Brno and Olomouc. Fortresses erected at Bratislava, Rajhrad, Staré Město and other places around 800 evidence the development of local centres of power in the same regions.

Charlemagne launched a series of military expeditions against the Avars in the last decade of the 8th century which caused the collapse of the Avar Khaganate. The &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot; narrates that Avars who &quot;could not stay in their previous dwelling places on account of the attacks of the Slavs&quot; approached Charlemagne in Aachen in 805 and asked to be allowed to settle in the lowlands along the river Rába.

Following the collapse of the Avar Khaganate, swords and other elements of Frankish military equipment became popular in territories to the north of the Middle Danube. A new archaeological horizon—the so-called &quot;Blatnica-Mikulčice horizon&quot;—emerged in the valley of the northern Morava river and its wider region in the same period. This horizon of metalwork represents a synthesis of &quot;Late Avar&quot; and Carolingian art. One of its signature items is a sword found in a grave in Blatnica in Slovakia, which is dated to the period between 825 and 850. According to the archaeologist Florin Curta, the sword was produced by a Frankish artisan from the Carolingian Empire. On the other hand, Ján Dekan writes that it represents how Moravian craftsmen selected &quot;elements from the ornamental content of Carolingian art which suited their aesthetic needs and traditions&quot;.

===Development of Moravia (c. 800–846)===

Moravia, the first Western Slavic polity, arose through the unification of the Slavic tribes settled north of the Danube. However, its formation is scarcely described by contemporaneous sources. The archaeologist Barford writes that the first report of the emerging Moravian state was recorded in 811. In the autumn of this year, according to the &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot;, Avar rulers and the &quot;duces&quot; or &quot;leaders of the Slavs who live along the Danube&quot; visited the court of Emperor Louis the Pious (814–840) in Aachen. The earliest certain reference to Moravians or &quot;Maravani&quot; is dated to 822 when the emperor &quot;received embassies and presents from all the East Slavs, that is, Obodrites, Sorbs, Wilzi, Bohemians, Moravians and Praedenecenti, and from the Avars living in Pannonia&quot; at an assembly held at Frankfurt.

The late-9th-century &quot;Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum&quot; (&quot;The Conversion of the Bavarians and the Carantanians&quot;) makes the first reference to a Moravian ruler. Carantanians (ancestors of present-day Slovenians) were the first Slavic people to accept Christianity from the West. They were mostly Christianized by Irish missionaries sent by the Archdiocese of Salzburg, among them Modestus, known as the &quot;Apostle of Carantanians&quot;. This process was later described in the Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum, which states that Mojmír, &quot;duke of the Moravians&quot;, expelled &quot;one Pribina&quot; across the Danube. Pribina fled to Ratpot who administered the March of Pannonia from around 833. Whether Pribina had up to that time been an independent ruler or one of Mojmir&#x27;s officials is a matter of scholarly discussion. For instance, Urbańczyk writes that Mojmir and Pribina were two of the many Moravian princes in the early 9th century, while according to Havlík, Třeštík and Vlasto, Pribina was Mojmír&#x27;s lieutenant in Nitra. Historians who identify Pribina as the ruler of an autonomous state, the Principality of Nitra—for instance, Bartl, Kirschbaum and Urbańczyk—add that &quot;Great Moravia&quot; emerged through the enforced integration of his principality into Moravia under Mojmír.

The 9th-century &quot;Catalogue of Fortresses and Regions to the North of the Danube&quot;—which lists the peoples along the borders of East Francia in a north-to-south order—mentions that the Moravians or &quot;Marharii&quot; had 11 fortresses or &quot;civitates&quot;. The document locates the &quot;Marhari&quot; between the Bohemians and the Bulgars, and also makes mention of the &quot;Merehani&quot; and their 30 fortresses. According to Havlík, who writes that &quot;Conversion&quot; is a consolidated version of notes made by several authors in different years, the Moravians are twice mentioned in the text: first as &quot;Marhari&quot;, and next as &quot;Merehani&quot;. He says, that the reference to the &quot;Marhari&quot; and their 11 fortresses was made between 817 and 843, and the note of the &quot;Merehani&quot; shows the actual state under Svatopluk I. In contrast with Havlík, Steinhübel together with Třeštík and Vlasto identify the &quot;Merehani&quot; with the inhabitants of the Principality of Nitra. A third view is presented by Püspöki-Nagy and Senga, who write that the reference to the &quot;Merehanii&quot;—who obviously inhabited the southern regions of the Great Hungarian Plains to the north of the Danube, but south of the territories dominated by the Bulgars—and their 30 fortresses shows the existence of another Moravia in Central Europe.

According to a 13th-century source, the &quot;History of the Bishops of Passau and the Dukes of Bavaria&quot;, Bishop Reginhar of Passau (818–838) baptized &quot;all of the Moravians&quot; in 831. There is no other information on the circumstances of this mass conversion. Vlasto writes that Mojmír had by that time been converted to Christianity; according to Petr Sommer and other historians, he was also baptized on this occasion. All the same, the &quot;Life of Methodius&quot; narrates that Christian missionaries had by the 860s arrived in Moravia &quot;from among the Italians, Greeks and Germans&quot; who taught them &quot;in various ways&quot;. The &quot;Life of Constantine&quot; adds that missionaries from East Francia did not forbid &quot;the offering of sacrifices according to the ancient customs&quot;, which shows that pagan rites were continued for decades even after 831.

According to the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;, around August 15, 846, Louis the German, King of East Francia (843–876) launched a campaign &quot;against the Moravian Slavs, who were planning to defect&quot;. The exact circumstances of his expedition are unclear. For instance, Vlasto writes that the Frankish monarch took advantage of the internal strife which followed Mojmír&#x27;s death, while according to Kirschbaum, Mojmír was captured and dethroned during the campaign. However, it is without doubt that Louis the German appointed Mojmír&#x27;s nephew, Rastislav, as the new duke of Moravia during this campaign.

===Fights for independence (846–870)===
Rastislav (846–870), who initially accepted the suzerainty of Louis the German, consolidated his position within Moravia and expanded the frontiers of his realm. For instance, according to Kirschbaum, he annexed the region of the Slanské Hills in the eastern parts of present-day Slovakia. Barford even writes that the development of the state mentioned as &quot;Great Moravia&quot; by Constantine Porphyrogenitus commenced in Rastislav&#x27;s reign.

He turned against East Francia and supported the rebellion of Radbod, the deposed prefect of the March of Pannonia, against Louis the German in 853. The Frankish monarch retaliated by invading Moravia in 855. According to the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;, the Moravians were &quot;defended by strong fortifications&quot;, and the Franks withdrew without defeating them, though the combats lasted until a peace treaty was worked out in 859. The truce is regarded as a stalemate and shows the growing strength of Rastislav&#x27;s realm. Conflicts between Moravia and East Francia continued for years. For instance, Rastislav supported Louis the German&#x27;s son, Carloman, in his rebellion against his father in 861. The first record of a raid by the Magyars in Central Europe seems to have been connected to these events. According to the &quot;Annals of St. Bertin&quot;, &quot;enemies called Hungarians&quot; ravaged Louis the German&#x27;s kingdom in 862, which suggests that they supported Carloman.

Rastislav wanted to weaken influence of Frankish priests in his realm, who served the interests of East Francia. He first sent envoys to Pope Nicholas I in 861 and asked him to send missionaries to Moravia who mastered the Slavic language. Having received no answer from Rome, Rastislav turned to the Byzantine Emperor Michael III with the same request. By establishing relations with Constantinople, he also desired to counter an anti-Moravian alliance recently concluded between the Franks and Bulgarians. Upon his request, the emperor sent two brothers, Constantine and Michael—the future Saints Cyril and Methodius to Moravia in 863. Constantine&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; narrates that he developed the first Slavic alphabet and translated the Gospel into Old Church Slavonic around that time.

Louis the German crossed the Danube and again invaded Moravia in August 864. He besieged Rastislav &quot;in a certain city, which in the language of that people is called Dowina&quot;, according to the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;. Although the Franks could not take the fortress, Rastislav agreed to accept Louis the German&#x27;s suzerainty. However, he continued to support the Frankish monarch&#x27;s opponents. For instance, Louis the German deprived one Count Werner &quot;of his public offices&quot;, because the count was suspected to have conspired with Rastislav against the king.

The Byzantine brothers, Constantine (Cyril) and Methodius, visited Rome in 867. At the end of the year, Pope Hadrian II (867–872) sanctioned their translations of liturgical texts and ordained six of their disciples as priests. The pope informed three prominent Slavic rulers—Rastislav, his nephew, Svatopluk and Kocel, who administered Lower Pannonia—of his approval of the use of the vernacular in the liturgy in a letter of 869. In 869 Methodius was sent by the pope to Rastislav, Svatopluk and Kocel, but Methodius visited only Kocel, who sent him back to the pope. Hadrian then consecrated Methodius as archbishop with the title of Metropolitan of Sirmium to &quot;the seat of Saint Andronicus&quot;, i.e., the see of Sirmium. At the beginning of the 9th century, many Carantanians (Alpine Slavs), ancestors of present-day Slovenians, settled in the Lower Pannonian region, also known as the Balaton Principality, which was referred to in Latin sources as Carantanorum regio, or &quot;The Land of the Carantanians&quot;. The name Carantanians (Quarantani) was in use until the 13th century. Kocel&#x27;s decision to support Methodius represented a complete break with his father&#x27;s pro-Frankish policy. Svatopluk had by that time been administering what had been the Principality of Nitra, under his uncle Rastislav&#x27;s suzerainty, but contemporaneous documents do not reveal the exact location of Svatopluk&#x27;s successorial territory. Frankish troops invaded both Rastislav&#x27;s and Svatopluk&#x27;s realms in August 869. According to the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;, the Franks destroyed many forts, defeated Moravian troops and seized loot. However, they could not take Rastislav&#x27;s main fortress and withdrew.

===Svatopluk&#x27;s reign (870–894)===
Svatopluk allied himself with the Franks and helped them seize Rastislav in 870. Carloman annexed Rastislav&#x27;s realm and appointed two Frankish lords, William and Engelschalk, to administer it. Frankish soldiers arrested Archbishop Methodius on his way from Rome to Moravia at the end of the year. Svatopluk, who continued to administer his own realm after his uncle&#x27;s fall, was accused of treachery and arrested by Carloman on Louis the German&#x27;s orders in 871. The Moravians rose up in open rebellion against the two Frankish governors and elected a kinsman of Svatopluk, Slavomír, duke. Svatopluk returned to Moravia, took over command of the insurgents, and drove the Franks from Moravia. According to the Czech historian Dušan Třeštík, the rebellion of 871 led to the formation of the first Slavic state.

Louis the German sent his armies against Moravia in 872. The imperial troops plundered the countryside, but could not take the &quot;extremely well-fortified stronghold&quot; where Svatopluk took refuge. The Moravian ruler even succeeded in mustering an army which defeated a number of imperial troops, forcing the Franks to withdraw from Moravia. Svatopluk soon initiated negotiations with Louis the German, which ended with a peace treaty concluded at Forchheim in May 874. According to the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;, at Forchheim Svatopluk&#x27;s envoy promised that Svatopluk &quot;would remain faithful&quot; to Louis the German &quot;all the days of his life&quot;, and the Moravian ruler was also obliged to pay a yearly tribute to East Francia.

In the meantime, Archbishop Methodius, who had been released upon the demand of Pope John VIII (872–882) in 873, returned to Moravia. Methodius&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; narrates that &quot;Prince Svatopluk and all the Moravians&quot; decided to entrust &quot;to him all the churches and clergy in all the towns&quot; in Moravia upon his arrival. In Moravia, Methodius continued the work of translation started in his brother&#x27;s life. For instance, he translated &quot;all the Scriptures in full, save Maccabees&quot;, according to his &quot;Life&quot;. However, Frankish priests in Moravia opposed the Slavic liturgy and even accused Methodius of heresy. Although the Holy See never denied Methodius&#x27;s orthodoxy, in 880 the Pope appointed his main opponent, Wiching, as bishop of Nitra upon the request of Svatopluk, who himself preferred the Latin rite.

A letter written around 900 by Archbishop Theotmar of Salzburg (873–907) and his suffragan bishops mentions that the pope sent Wiching to &quot;a newly baptized people&quot; whom Svatopluk &quot;had defeated in war and converted from paganism to Christianity&quot;. Other sources also prove that Svatopluk significantly expanded the borders of his realm. For instance, according to the &quot;Life of Methodius&quot;, Moravia &quot;began to expand much more into all lands and to defeat its enemies successfully&quot; in the period beginning around 874. The same source writes of a &quot;very powerful pagan prince settled on the Vistula&quot; in present-day Poland who persecuted the Christians in his country, but was attacked and seized by Svatopluk.

Upon Methodius&#x27;s request, in June 880 Pope John issued the bull &quot;Industriae tuae&quot; for Svatopluk whom he addressed as &quot;glorious count&quot; &quot;(gloriosus comes)&quot;. In the bull, the pope refers to Svatopluk as &quot;the only son&quot; () of the Holy See, thus applying a title which had up to that time been only used in papal correspondence with emperors and candidates for imperial rank. The pope explicitly granted the protection of the Holy See to the Moravian monarch, his officials and subjects. Furthermore, the bull also confirmed Methodius&#x27;s position as the head of the church in Moravia with jurisdiction over all clergymen, including the Frankish priests, in Svatopluk&#x27;s realm and Old Church Slavonic was recognized as the fourth liturgical language together with Latin, Greek and Hebrew.

The longer version of the &quot;Annals of Salzburg&quot; makes mention of a raid by the Magyars and the Kabars in East Francia in 881. According to Gyula Kristó and other historians, Svatopluk initiated this raid, because his relations with Arnulf—the son of Carloman, King of East Francia (876–881), who administered the March of Pannonia—became tense. Archbishop Theotmar of Salzburg clearly accused the Moravians of hiring &quot;a large number of Hungarians&quot; and sending them against East Francia at an unspecified date.
During the &quot;Wilhelminer War&quot;—a civil war between two factions of local noblemen in the March of Pannonia which lasted from 882 and 884—Svatopluk &quot;collected troops from all the Slav lands&quot; and invaded Pannonia. According to the Bavarian version of the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;, the Moravians&#x27; invasion &quot;led to Pannonia&#x27;s being laid waste&quot; to the east of the river Rába. However, Regino of Prüm states that it was Arnulf of Carinthia who maintained control over Pannonia in 884. Svatopluk had a meeting with Emperor Charles the Fat (881–888) at Tulln an der Donau in Bavaria in 884. At the meeting, &quot;dux&quot; Svatopluk became the emperor&#x27;s vassal and &quot;swore fidelity to him&quot;, promising that he would never attack the emperor&#x27;s realm.

Archbishop Methodius died on April 6, 885. Led by Bishop Wiching of Nitra, Methodius&#x27;s opponents took advantage of his death and persuaded Pope Stephen V (885–891) to restrict the use of Old Church Slavonic in the liturgy in the bull &quot;Quia te zelo&quot;. Bishop Wiching even convinced Svatopluk to expel all Methodius&#x27;s disciples from Moravia in 886, thus marring the promising literary and cultural boom of Central European Slavs—the Slovaks took nearly a thousand years to develop a new literary language of their own.

Pope Stephen addressed the &quot;Quia te zelo&quot; bull to &quot;Zventopolco regi Sclavorum&quot; (&quot;Svatopluk, King of the Slavs&quot;), suggesting that Svatopluk had by the end of 885 been crowned king. Likewise, Frankish annals occasionally referred to Svatopluk as king in connection with events occurring in this period. The &quot;Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea&quot;—a late-12th-century source with questionable reliability—narrates that one &quot;Sventopelk&quot; was crowned king &quot;on the field of Dalma&quot; in the presence of a papal legate.

Moravia reached its maximum territorial extent in the last years of Svatopluk&#x27;s reign. According to Regino of Prüm, King Arnulf of East Francia &quot;gave the command of the Bohemians to King Zwentibald of the Moravian Slavs&quot; in 890. Bartl and other Slovak historians write that Svatopluk &quot;probably&quot; also annexed Silesia and Lusatia in the early 890s. According to the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;, King Arnulf proposed a meeting to Svatopluk in 892, &quot;but the latter in his usual fashion refused to come to the king and betrayed his fidelity and all the things which he had promised before&quot;. In response, Arnulf invaded Moravia in 892, but could not defeat Svatopluk, although Magyar horsemen also supported the Eastern Frankish monarch.

===Decline and fall (894–before 907)===

Svatopluk—&quot;a man most prudent among his people and very cunning by nature&quot;, according to Regino of Prüm—died in the summer of 894. He was succeeded by his son, Mojmir II, but his empire shortly disintegrated, because the tribes subjugated to Svatopluk&#x27;s rule by force started to get rid of Moravian supremacy. For instance, the Bohemian dukes (based in the Prague region) accepted King Arnulf&#x27;s suzerainty in June 895, and Mojmír II attempted to restore his supremacy over them without success in the next two years. On the other hand, he succeeded in restoring the Church organization in Moravia by persuading Pope John IX (898–900) to send his legates to Moravia in 898. The legates in short order installed an archbishop and &quot;three bishops as his suffragans&quot; in Moravia.

Conflicts emerging between Mojmír II and his younger brother, Svatopluk II, gave King Arnulf a pretext to send his troops to Moravia in 898 and 899. The &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot; writes that the &quot;boy&quot; Svatopluk II was rescued by Bavarian forces &quot;from the dungeon of the city in which he was held with his men&quot; in 899. According to Bartl, who wrote that Svatopluk II had inherited the &quot;Principality of Nitra&quot; from his father, the Bavarians also destroyed the fortress at Nitra on this occasion.

According to most nearly contemporaneous sources, the Hungarians played a prominent role in the fall of Moravia. For instance, Regino of Prüm writes that Svatopluk I&#x27;s &quot;sons held his kingdom for a short and unhappy time, because the Hungarians utterly destroyed everything in it&quot;. The Hungarians started their conquest of the Carpathian Basin after their defeat in the westernmost territories of the Pontic steppes around 895 by a coalition of the Bulgars and Pechenegs. Only a late source, the 16th-century Johannes Aventinus, writes that the Hungarians had by that time controlled wide regions to east of the rivers Hron and Danube in the Carpathian Basin.

A letter of Theotmar of Salzburg and his suffragans evidences that around 900 the Moravians and the Bavarians accused each other of having formed alliances, even by taking oaths &quot;by the means of a dog and a wolf and through other abominable and pagan customs&quot;, with the Hungarians. According to Liudprand of Cremona, the Hungarians already &quot;claimed for themselves the nation of the Moravians, which King Arnulf had subdued with the aid of their might&quot; at the coronation of Arnulf&#x27;s son, Louis the Child, in 900. The &quot;Annals of Grado&quot; adds that a large Hungarian army &quot;attacked and invaded&quot; the Moravians in 900. Facing the threat of further Hungarian attacks, Mojmír II concluded a peace treaty with Louis the Child in 901.

Due to the lack of documentary evidence, the year in which Moravia ceased to exist cannot be determined with certainty. Róna-Tas writes that the Hungarians occupied Moravia in 902, Victor Spinei says that this happened in 903 or 904, while according to Spiesz, the Moravian state ceased to exist in 907. The &quot;Raffelstetten Customs Regulations&quot;, which was issued in the years 903–906, still refers to the &quot;markets of the Moravians&quot;, suggesting that Moravia still existed at that time. It is without doubt that no Moravian forces fought in the battle at &quot;Brezalauspurc&quot;, where the Hungarians routed a large Bavarian force in 907.

==State and society==

===Sources===
Written sources from the 9th century contain almost no information on the internal affairs of Moravia. Only two legal texts—the &quot;Nomocanon&quot; and the &quot;Court Law for the People&quot;—have been preserved. The former is a translation of a collection of Byzantine ecclesiastical law; the latter is based on the 8th-century Byzantine law code known as &quot;Ecloga&quot;. Both were completed by Methodius shortly before his death in 885.

In addition to the study of early medieval chronicles and charters, archaeological research contributed to the understanding of the Moravian state and society. The Moravian centres at Mikulčice, Pohansko and Staré Město were thoroughly excavated in the 1950s and 1960s. However, as Macháček writes, &quot;the acquired huge amounts of finds and data still have to be properly processed&quot;.

===Settlement structure===
The nuclei of the Great Moravian settlement structure were well-defended fortified settlements built by the local Slavs both on elevated positions and lowland areas like marshes and river islands. Most Great Moravian castles were rather large hill forts, fortified by wooden palisades, stone walls and in some cases, moats. The typical Great Moravian ramparts combined an outer drystone wall with an internal timber structure filled with earth.The fortifications usually formed several contiguous enclosures, with the elite buildings concentrated in the centre and crafts in the outer enclosures. Most buildings were made of timber, but ecclesiastical buildings and residential dwellings were made of stone. In many cases, prehistoric fortifications were also integrated. The Great Moravian towns, especially in Moravia, but also in the lowlands of Slovakia, were frequently far from the place where the stone was mined and material was transported dozens of kilometres.

The Great Moravian settlements can be divided into four main categories. The most important were localities with central functions like Mikulčice-Valy, Staré Město – Uherské Hradiště and Nitra, where several castles and settlements formed a huge fortified (pre-)urban agglomeration. Along with the main centres, the system of fortified settlements included fortified regional administrative hubs, forts whose primary function was defence, and refuge forts which were not inhabited permanently but were used in the case of danger. The largest forts were usually protected by a chain of smaller forts. Smaller forts were also built to protect trade routes and to provide shelter for peasants in case of attack. The existence of noble courts like in Ducové and in other places is also documented. Their form was probably inspired by Carolingian estates called &quot;curtis&quot;.

In 9th-century Mikulčice, the central fortified area, or &quot;Acropolis&quot;, was set on an island in the Morava and surrounded by a stone-faced rampart that enclosed an area of six hectares (extensive extramural settlement of 200 hectares stood unfortified). Although the location of the Great Moravian capital, &quot;Veligrad&quot;, has not been identified, Mikulčice with its palace and 12 churches is the most widely accepted candidate. An important settlement was a large agglomeration in Pohansko near Břeclav. Nitra, the centre of the eastern part of the Empire, was ruled autonomously by the heir of the dynasty as an appanage. Nitra consisted of several large fortified settlements with various functions and approximately twenty specialized craftsmen&#x27;s villages, making it a real metropolis of its time. Crafts included a production of luxury goods, such as jewelry and glass. The agglomeration was surrounded by a number of smaller forts.

Bratislava Castle had a stone two-story palace and a spacious three-nave basilica, built in the mid-9th century. Excavations of the cemetery situated by the basilica uncovered examples of Great Moravian jewelry, similar in style and quality to that from Mikulčice. The castle&#x27;s name was first recorded in 907, during the fall of Great Moravia, as &quot;Brezalauspurc&quot;. This name literally means either &quot;Predslav&#x27;s Castle&quot; after a son of Svatopluk I who is mentioned in the Cividale del Friuli, or &quot;Braslav&#x27;s Castle&quot; after Braslav of Pannonia, who was a count appointed by King Arnulf (Arnulf of Carantania) of East Francia. The agglomeration of several fortified settlements was unearthed in Slovak Bojná, discovering important artifacts related to Christianization of the territory. Numerous castles were built on the hills around the valleys of the Váh and the river Nitra, and also in other areas (e.g., Detva, Zeplín, Čingov), but were not built in south-eastern Slovakia.

The sturdy Devín Castle, in vicinity of Bratislava, guarded Great Moravia against attacks from the West. Although some authors claim that it was built only later as a stronghold of the Kings of Hungary, excavations have unearthed an older Slavic fortified settlement founded in the 8th century. During the Great Moravian period, Devín Castle was a seat of a local lord, whose retainers were buried around a stone Christian church. These two castles were reinforced by smaller fortifications in Devínska Nová Ves, Svätý Jur and elsewhere. Another example is the fortress at Thunau am Kamp near Gars am Kamp, overlooking the river Kamp in Lower Austria. The defences here re-utilised banked defences of the Bronze Age and were only slightly smaller (fifty acres) than the area of the contemporary Frankish Emperor&#x27;s capital of Regensburg.

The number of forts discovered exceeds the number recorded in the sources (11 centres of Moravians and 30 centres of &quot;other Moravians&quot; or &quot;Merehanos&quot;; opinions differ as to how to interpret the reference to &quot;Merehanos&quot;). Though the only castles which are mentioned by name in written texts are &quot;Nitrawa&quot; (828; identified with Nitra), &quot;Dowina&quot; (864; sometimes identified with Devín Castle) and perhaps &quot;Brezalauspurc&quot; (907; sometimes identified with Bratislava Castle), some sources claim that Uzhhorod in Ukraine (903) was also a Moravian fortress. Devín Castle is sometimes identified with a &quot;fortress of Prince Rastislav&quot; mentioned in the &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot;.

===Monarchs===

Moravia was ruled by monarchs from a &quot;wider kinship&quot; known as the House of Mojmir. The throne rarely passed from father to son. Actually, Svatopluk I was the only ruler who was succeeded by his son. Rastislav ascended the throne through the East Frankish monarch&#x27;s intervention, and Slavomir was elected as duke when the Franks captured Svatopluk in 871. The latter case reveals the strong claim of the Mojmir dynasty to the throne, because Slavomir was an ordained priest at the time of his election. The Moravian monarchs were regularly styled as &quot;ducis&quot; (&quot;dukes&quot;), occasionally as &quot;regis&quot; (&quot;kings&quot;) or &quot;maliks&quot; (&quot;kings&quot;) in 9th-century documents. Tombs within a church have only been discovered at Mikulčice, implying that royals had an exclusive right to be buried in such a prestigious place.

===Administration===
The &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot; never refers to the Moravian monarchs as rulers of a state, but as heads of a people—&quot;dux Maravorum&quot; (&quot;duke of the Moravians&quot;). Accordingly, Macháček writes that &quot;Great Moravia was not primarily organized on a territorial basis [...], but more likely on the foundation of real or fictitious kinship bonds within the tribal structure&quot;. On the other hand, Havlík says that Moravia was divided into counties each headed by &quot;rich, honourable and well-born noblemen&quot; whom he styles as &quot;zhupans&quot;; he even adds that the number of counties increased from 11 to 30 by the second half of the 9th century. Štefan adds that the existence of scattered groups of farmer warriors, which is suggested by archaeological research, implies the existence of administrative territorial units, because without such a system the monarchs could not organize their campaigns.

Svatopluk incorporated a number of Slavic tribes (including the Bohemians and Vistulans) into his empire. The subjugated tribes were administered by vassal princes or governors, but they preserved their autonomy, which contributed to the quick disintegration of Svatopluk&#x27;s Moravia after his death.
According to Bartl, Kirschbaum, Štefan, and other historians, Great Moravia had two centres. According to Havlík the terms &quot;Moravian lands&quot; (&quot;Moravьskskyję strany&quot;), &quot;Upper Moravias&quot; (&quot;vyšnьnii Moravě&quot;, &quot;vyšnьneję Moravy&quot;) and &quot;Moravian realms&quot; (&quot;regna Marahensium&quot;, &quot;regna Marauorum&quot;) which were used in 9th-century documents refer to the dualistic organisation of the Moravian state, consisting of the &quot;Realm of Rastislav&quot; (&quot;regnum Rastizi&quot;) and the &quot;Realm of Svatopluk&quot; (&quot;regnum Zwentibaldi&quot;). He and other historians identify the former with modern Moravia in the Czech Republic, and the latter with the Principality of Nitra in present-day Slovakia. However, this view is not universally accepted: Svatopluk&#x27;s realm has also been identified with the wider region of Staré Město, or with the lands between the Danube and the Tisza or east of the Tisza.

===Warfare===
The known sources contain records about 65 events related to warfare and Great Moravia. The most detailed are the Frankish sources during Svatopluk&#x27;s reign. The structure of the Great Moravian army was based mainly on an early feudal conception of military service, performed primarily by the ruling elites.

The core of the Great Moravian army was a princely retinue comprising professional warriors, who were responsible for collecting tribute and punishing wrongdoers (&quot;družina&quot;). The &quot;družina&quot; consisted of members of the aristocracy (&quot;older retinue&quot;) and members of the princely military groups (&quot;younger retinue&quot;). Some of its members formed a permanent armed guard for the prince, while the rest were garrisoned at forts or at other strategic points. The &quot;družina&quot; was probably relatively loyal and provided stable support for the prince since there is no known record of any dissatisfaction with it or of any uprising. The permanent part of the army had an expressly cavalry character. The Great Moravian heavy cavalry emulated the contemporary Frankish predecessors of knights, with the expensive equipment that only the highest social strata could afford (a contemporary Arab traveller, Ahmad ibn Fadlan, reported that Svatopluk I had plenty of cavalry horses). The overall size of the &quot;družina&quot; is estimated by Ruttkay at 3,000–5,000 men. In the case of larger mobilisations, cavalry was reinforced by additional smaller units recruited from the retinues of local magnates and from traditional communities (&quot;občina&quot;). The second element of the army (&quot;pohotovosť&quot;) consisted of lower classes of free citizens who were not, in most cases, professional warriors. However, thanks to their large numbers and knowledge of the prevalent types of weapons they represented a serious military force. They played a decisive role mainly in the defence of Great Moravian territory; their participation in wars of expansion was less common. The army was led by the prince or, in his absence, by a commander-in-chief called a &quot;voivode&quot;. The maximum size of the army is estimated at 20,000–30,000 men. In case of external aggression, ordinary people participated in defence and diversion actions. An important element of the defence of Great Moravia was a system of strong fortifications, which were difficult to besiege with the then prevailing forms of military organization. For example, a Frankish chronicler wrote with awe about the size of Rastislav&#x27;s fortress (&quot;firmissimum, ut feritur, vallum&quot;).

The typical weapon of a West Slavic foot soldier was an axe of a specific shape, called a &quot;bradatica&quot;. Spears were universally used by both infantry and cavalry. The weapons associated with a nomadic (Avar) culture, like sabres, reflexion bows and specific types of spears are missing. On the other hand, a military equipment became more influenced by western types and new types of weapons like double-edged swords (rare before the 9th century) became popular. Archers, unlike the previous period, were already a part of the infantry.

===Aristocracy===
The existence of a local aristocracy is well documented: contemporaneous sources refer to &quot;leading men&quot; (&quot;optimates&quot; or &quot;primates&quot;), and &quot;nobiles viri&quot; or &quot;principes&quot;. However, these documents do not reveal the basis of the Moravian chiefs&#x27; power. Richly furnished graves—with the exception of the one at Blatnica, which is &quot;an old and disputable find&quot;, according to Štefan—have only been unearthed in Mikulčice and other large fortifications controlled by the monarchs. Štefan writes that the concentration of prestige goods in the towns shows that &quot;immediate contact with the sovereign, who certainly travelled between the centres, was apparently the best winning strategy for the top elite&quot;. On the other hand, the &quot;optimates&quot; had an important role in the government: the monarchs did not make important decisions without discussing them in a council formed by the Moravian &quot;dukes&quot;.

===Population===

Great Moravia was inhabited by the West Slavic subgroup of the larger Slavic ethno-linguistical group. The West Slavs have their origin in early Slavic tribes which settled in Central Europe after East Germanic tribes had largely left this area during the migration period, while the West Slavs &quot;assimilated the remaining Celtic and Germanic populations&quot; in the area.

Moravians had strong cultural ties to their western neighbors, the Franks, with certain objects proving Carolingian influence. The archaeological evidence demonstrates that the 9th-century material culture found in modern Moravia was very much in the Frankish sphere and showed minor Byzantine influence.

Carolingian influence affected all spheres of life in Great Moravia. After the Carolingian Empire was divided, the Ottonian dynasty took over and continued and cultivated Carolingian traditions. It is not accidental
that the newly created medieval West-Slavonic states borrow from Carolingian tradition via the Ottonian Empire.

Most of the population was formed by freemen, who were obliged to pay an annual tax. Slavery and feudal dependency are also recorded.

The analysis of early medieval cemeteries in Moravia shows that 40 percent of men and 60 percent of women died before reaching the age of 40. More than 40 percent of the graves contained the remains of children aged one to twelve. However, the cemeteries also document rich nutrition and advanced health care. For instance, a third of the examined skeletons had no caries or lost teeth, and bone fractures healed without dislocation.

==Economy==
The large 9th-century fortresses unearthed at Mikulčice and other places were located in the wider region of the confluence of the rivers Morava and Danube. Two important trade routes crossed this region in this period, the Danube and the ancient Amber Road, implying that these settlements, all lying on rivers, were important centres of commerce. Finds of tools, raw materials and semi-manufactured goods show that quarters inhabited by craftsmen also existed in these settlements. The large fortresses were surrounded by a number of small villages where the locals were engaged in agriculture. They cultivated wheat, barley, millet and other cereals, and farmed cattle, pigs, sheep and horse. Their animals were relatively small: for instance, their horses were not larger than modern Przewalski horses.

The existence of a general exchange medium in Moravia has not been proven: there is no sign of local coinage and foreign coins are scarce. According to Bialeková and other archaeologists, the axe-shaped ingots (grivnas) unearthed in great number in fortresses served as &quot;premonetary currencies&quot;. This theory has not universally been accepted, because these objects have also been interpreted as &quot;intermediate products intended for further treatment&quot;. According to Macháček, the lack of coins meant that Moravian monarchs could not &quot;effectively collect taxes, customs and fines&quot;, which weakened their international position.

Iron metallurgy and smithing were the most important branches of local industry. An example of highly developed tool production are asymmetrical plowshares. There is no sign of silver, gold, copper or lead mines in Moravia, but jewellery and weapons were produced locally. Accordingly, their prime material was acquired as loot or gift or brought to Moravia by merchants. Archaeological research also evidences the import of prestige goods, including silk, brocade and glass vessels. According to Štefan and Macháček, the Moravians primarily provided slaves, acquired as prisoners of war during their raids in the neighbouring regions, in exchange for these luxury goods. For instance, Archbishop Thietmar of Salzburg accused the Moravians of &quot;bringing noble men and honest women into slavery&quot; during their campaigns in Pannonia. Slave trading is also well documented: the &quot;First Legend of Naum&quot; narrates that many of Methodius&#x27;s disciples &quot;were sold for money to the Jews&quot; after 885, and the &quot;Raffelstetten Customs Regulations&quot; makes mention of slaves delivered from Moravia to the west.

===Sacral architecture===

The views on Great Moravian sacral architecture changed dramatically during the second half of the 20th century. At first, researchers assumed it to be limited to simple wooden churches like those known from the German environment in dating from the 7th to 8th centuries. These wooden churches were suitable for initial missionary activities due to the easy availability of materials, quick construction and no need for consecration. This opinion was refined in 1949 after excavations in Staré Město. From the 1960s, stone churches have also been excavated in Slovakia. As of 2014, more than 25 sacral buildings have been safely identified in the core territory of Great Moravia (Moravia and Western Slovakia). The remains of the first uncovered churches were only &quot;negatives&quot; (ditches filled with secondary material after removal of original foundations), but later research also uncovered remains of buildings with original foundations. Especially after the discovery of Great Moravian graves near the church in Kopčany, the potential Great Moravian origin of several still-standing churches in Slovakia (&quot;viz.&quot;, Kopčany, Nitrianska Blatnica, Kostoľany pod Tribečom) was once more an open question. The exact dating is a goal of ongoing research based on radiocarbon analysis and dendrochronology.

Great Moravian sacral architecture is represented by a rich variety of types, from three-nave basilicas (Mikulčice III, Bratislava), triconcha (Devín), simple rotunda without apses (Mikulčice VII), two-apse rotunda (Mikulčice VI), tetraconchic rotunda (Mikulčice IX) and a whole group of one-nave churches and rotundas with one apse. The largest number of churches has been found in south-eastern Moravia. Mikulčice, with twelve churches, clearly dominates among all other localities with the first stone churches built around 800 (a potential thirteenth church is Kopčany, on the Slovak side of the border). The three-nave basilica from Mikulčice, which has interior dimensions of 35 m by 9 m and a separate baptistery, is the largest sacral building found to date. The high concentration of churches in Mikululčice exceeded the needs of the local population, and so are believed to be proprietary churches (&quot;Eigenkirchen&quot;), known also in Francia. Large churches were also important ecclesiastical centres. The current dating of several churches precedes the Byzantine mission. The churches were decorated mostly by frescoes, but usage of secco is also documented. The authors were probably foreign artists from Francia and northern Italy (the latter indicated by, for example, the chemical composition of paintings in Bratislava and Devín).

Great Moravian sacral architecture was probably influenced by Frankish, Dalmatian-Istrian, Byzantine and classical architecture, which also indicated complex missionary activities. Two open-air museums, in Modrá near Uherské Hradiště and in Ducové, are devoted to Great Moravian architecture.

===Religion===

Like other Slavs, the Great Moravian Slavs originally practised a polytheistic religion with an ancestor cult. Several cult places used prior to the Christianization of Moravia have been found in Moravia (Mikulčice and Pohansko). However, we do not know what these objects, such as a ring ditch with a fire, a horse sacrifice, or human limbs ritually buried in a cemetery, meant to Great Moravians. An alleged cult object in Mikulčice was reportedly used until the evangelization of the Moravian elite in the mid-9th century and idols in Pohansko were raised on the site of a demolished church during the pagan backlash in the 10th century. The only Slavic pagan shrine found in modern Slovakia is an object in Most pri Bratislave dedicated probably to the god of war and thunder Perun. The shrine was abandoned in the mid-9th century and never restored.

The spread of Christianity had several stages and it is still an open research question. In older publications, the first organized missions were attributed mainly to Hiberno-Scottish missionaries, but modern works are more sceptical about their direct influence. The territory of Great Moravia was originally evangelized by missionaries coming from the Frankish Empire or Byzantine enclaves in Italy and Dalmatia from the early 8th century and sporadically earlier. Traces of an Aquileia-Dalmatic mission are found in Great Moravian architecture and language. Northern Italian influence is assumed also for golden plaques with Christian motifs from Bojná (probably from a portable altar), which belong to the most important Christian artefacts dated prior to the mission of Saints Cyril and Methodius. Especially after the defeat of the Avars at the end of the 8th century, Frankish missionaries became the most important part of organized missions. The first Christian church of the Western and Eastern Slavs known from written sources was built in 828 by Pribina in Nitra and consecrated by Bishop Adalram of Salzburg. Most of the territory was Christianized until the mid-9th century. Despite the formal endorsement by the elites, Great Moravian Christianity was described as containing many pagan elements as late as 852. Grave goods, such as food, could be found even in church graveyards. The Church organization in Great Moravia was supervised by the Bavarian clergy until the arrival of the Byzantine missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius in 863.

In 880, the pope ordained a Swabian monk, Wiching, as bishop of the newly established see of Nitra (&quot;sancta ecclesia Nitriensis&quot;). Some experts (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Szőke Béla Miklós) say that the location of the seat of 9th century diocese is different from present-day Nitra.

===Literature===

The impact of the mission of Cyril and Methodius extended beyond the religious and political spheres. Old Church Slavonic became the fourth liturgical language of the Christian world. However, after Methodius&#x27;s death (885) all his followers were expelled from Great Moravia; accordingly, the use of Slavic liturgy in Great Moravia lasted only about 22 years. Its late form remains the liturgical language of the Ukrainian, Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian and Polish Orthodox Churches. Cyril also invented the Glagolitic alphabet, suitable for Slavic languages, and first translated the Bible into a Slavic language, along with Methodius, who later completed the project.

Methodius wrote the first Slavic legal code, combining local customary law with advanced Byzantine law. Similarly, the Great Moravian criminal law code was not merely a translation from Latin, but also punished a number of offenses originally tolerated by pre-Christian Slavic mores, yet prohibited by Christianity (mostly related to sexual conduct). The canon law was simply adopted from Byzantine sources.

There are not many literary works that can be unambiguously identified as originally written in Great Moravia. One of them is &quot;Proglas&quot;, a cultivated poem in which Cyril defends the Slavic liturgy. &quot;Vita Cyrilli&quot; (attributed to Clement of Ohrid) and &quot;Vita Methodii&quot; (probably written by Methodius&#x27;s successor Gorazd) are biographies with valuable information about Great Moravia under Rastislav and Svatopluk I.

The brothers also founded an academy, initially led by Methodius, which produced hundreds of Slavic clerics. A well-educated class was essential for administration of all early-feudal states and Great Moravia was no exception. &quot;Vita Methodii&quot; mentions that the bishop of Nitra served as Svatopluk I&#x27;s chancellor, and even Prince Koceľ of the Balaton Principality was said to have mastered the Glagolitic script. The location of the Great Moravian academy has not been identified, but possible sites include Mikulčice (where some styli have been found in an ecclesiastical building), Devín Castle (with a building identified as a probable school) and Nitra (with its Episcopal basilica and monastery). When Methodius&#x27;s disciples were expelled from Great Moravia by Svatopluk I in 885, they disseminated their knowledge (including the Glagolitic script) to other Slavic countries, such as Bulgaria, Croatia and Bohemia. The Cyrillic script was created in Bulgaria in the Preslav Literary School, which became the standard alphabet the Bulgarian Empire and later in the Kievan Rus&#x27; (modern day Russia, Ukraine and Belarus). The Great Moravian cultural heritage was further developed in Bulgarian seminaries, paving the way for the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

The Cyrillo-Methodian cultural mission had significant impact on most Slavic languages and stood at the beginning of the modern Cyrillic alphabet, created in the 9th century AD in Bulgaria by Bulgarian disciples of Cyril and Methodius (Naum of Preslav, Clement of Ohrid and others).

===Arts===

In the first half of the 9th century, Great Moravian craftsmen were inspired by contemporary Carolingian art. In the second half of the 9th century, Great Moravian jewelry was influenced by Byzantine, Eastern Mediterranean and Adriatic styles. However, in the words of Czech archaeologist Josef Poulík, &quot;these new forms and techniques were not copied passively, but were transformed in the local idiom, establishing in this way the roots of the distinctive Great Moravian jewellery style.&quot; Typical Great Moravian jewelry included silver and golden earrings decorated by fine granular filigree, as well as silver and gilded bronze buttons covered by foliate ornaments.

==Legacy==
Great Moravian centres (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Bratislava (Pozsony, Pressburg), Nitra (Nyitra), Tekov (Bars) and Zemplín (Zemplén)) retained their functions after the fall of Great Moravia, although the identification of Bratislava, Tekov and Zemplín as Great Moravian castles are not generally accepted. Several sources suggest that Hungarian rulers followed the contemporary German or Bulgar patents when they established the new administrative system in their kingdom, or they introduced a new system.

Social differentiation in Great Moravia reached the state of early feudalism, creating the social basis for development of later medieval states in the region. The question what happened to Great Moravian noble families after 907 is still under debate. On the one hand, recent research indicates that a significant part of the local aristocracy remained more or less undisturbed by the fall of Great Moravia and their descendants became nobles in the newly formed Kingdom of Hungary. The most prominent example are the powerful families of Hunt and Pázmán. On the other hand, both Anonymous and Simon of Kéza, two chroniclers of the early history of Hungary, recorded that the prominent noble families of the kingdom descended either from leaders of the Magyar tribes or from immigrants, and they did not connect any of them to Great Moravia. For example, the ancestors of the clan Hunt-Pázmán (&quot;Hont-Pázmány&quot;), whose Great Moravian origin has been advanced by Slovak scholars, were reported by Simon of Kéza to have arrived from the Duchy of Swabia in the late 10th century.

The territories mentioned as &quot;Tercia pars regni&quot; (lit., &quot;one-third part of the Kingdom of Hungary&quot;) in the medieval sources are referred to as the &quot;Duchy&quot; in Hungarian scholarly works and as the &quot;Principality of Nitra&quot; in Slovak academic sources. These territories were ruled autonomously by members of the Árpád dynasty residing in Bihar (today &quot;Biharea&quot; in Romania) or in Nitra—a practice reminiscent of the Great Moravian appanage system, but also similar to that of some other dynasties in the Early Middle Ages (&quot;e.g.&quot;, the Ruriks in the Kievan Rus&#x27;). The existence of an autonomous political unit centered around Nitra is often considered by Slovak scholars an example of political continuity from the Great Moravian period.

Great Moravia also became a prominent theme of the Czech and Slovak romantic nationalism of the 19th century. The Byzantine double-cross thought to have been brought by Cyril and Methodius is currently part of the symbol of Slovakia and the Constitution of Slovakia refers to Great Moravia in its preamble. Interest about that period rose as a result of the national revival in the 19th century. Great Moravian history has been regarded as a cultural root of several Slavic nations in Central Europe and it was employed in attempts to create a single Czechoslovak identity in the 20th century.

Although the source cited above and other sources mention that Great Moravia disappeared without trace and that its inhabitants left for the Bulgars, with Croats and Magyars following their victories, archaeological research and toponyms suggest the continuity of Slavic population in the valleys of the rivers of the Inner Western Carpathians. Moreover, there are sporadic references to Great Moravia from later years: in 924/925, both Folkuin in his &quot;Gesta abb. Lobiensium&quot; and Ruotger in &quot;Archiepiscopi Coloniensis Vita Brunonis&quot; mention Great Moravia. In 942, Magyar warriors captured during their raid in al-Andalus said that Moravia is the northern neighbour of their people. The fate of the northern and western parts of former Central Europe in the 10th century is thus largely unclear.

The eastern part of the Great Moravian core territory (present-day Slovakia) fell under domination of the Hungarian Árpád dynasty. The north-west borders of the Principality of Hungary became a mostly uninhabited or sparsely inhabited land. This was the Hungarian &quot;gyepűelve&quot;, and it can be considered as a march that effectively lasted until the mid-13th century. The rest remained under the rule of the local Slavic aristocracy and was gradually integrated into the Kingdom of Hungary in a process finished in the 14th century. In 1000 or 1001, all of present-day Slovakia was taken over by Poland under Bolesław I, and much of this territory became part of the Kingdom of Hungary by 1031.

<text>Faegheh Atashin (; born 5 May 1950), known professionally as Googoosh (, ), is an Iranian singer and former actress. Regarded as a pop icon, she is one of the most popular and prolific entertainers in Iran, and her career has spanned over six decades. Googoosh has enjoyed significant popularity since the beginning of her career, ultimately becoming a cultural icon inside Iran and abroad.

She is mainly known for her contributions to Iranian pop music, but she also starred in a variety of Persian movies from the 1950s to the 1970s. She achieved the pinnacle of her fame and success towards the end of the 1970s. In the 1970s, Googoosh was widely emulated by Iranian women, as they copied her clothing (miniskirts) and her short haircut (known as the &quot;Googooshi&quot;). Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, she remained in Tehran until 2000 and did not perform again during that period due to the ban on female singers. Younger generations of Iranians have rediscovered her music via bootleg recordings. After leaving Iran in 2000, she performed a total of 27 concerts in European and North American countries in that year. Recent projects include a new collaboration with Iranian singer-songwriter Hassan Shamaizadeh from her 2012 album &quot;Ejaz&quot;, as well as serving as head judge and head of academy for the popular reality show &quot;Googoosh Music Academy&quot; broadcast on London-based satellite channel Manoto 1.

Since her return to the stage in the summer of 2000, she has performed in concerts and venues all around the world, including the Madison Square Garden in New York, the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, the Ericsson Globe in Stockholm, Honda Center in Anaheim, Royal Albert Hall in London and the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles She has recorded songs in many languages including Persian, Azerbaijani, Turkish, English, Spanish, Italian, Arabic, Armenian and French. She has a significant following outside of Iran and has even received the attention of European and African media and press.

==Early life==

Googoosh was born as Faegheh Atashin on 5 May 1950, in Tehran, to Azerbaijani parents who emigrated from the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union. She was quickly called &quot;Googoosh&quot;, an Armenian name normally exclusively used for boys but which became her stage name. In an interview she noted that she was called Googoosh from a very early age; in her birth certificate however her birth name Faegheh is recorded.

==Career==
=== Before the Revolution (1953–1979) ===

Googoosh began her career in acting as a child in Persian films. During the 1970s, Googoosh began her singing career and a meteoric rise to fame and success as she drove the edge of Iranian pop music further and further. Known for her flamboyant outfits and fashion sense, Googoosh wowed her pop-culture-hungry fans in Iran and abroad with her trademark hairdos and hip-elegant style, inspiring many Iranian women to copy her hairdos. Her music ranged from upbeat 1960s and 1970s pop, given a traditional-tinged edge, to declamatory, emotional ballads dealing with love and loss, comparable to the chanson style of music by artists like Édith Piaf. Her music was popular among non-Persian-speaking audiences as well. She starred in over 25 movies, one of which was to be the most commercially successful Iranian motion picture of all time. Googoosh performed many times for the royal family and was a favorite of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi&#x27;s wife and children. She performed at the party given for the 17th birthday of Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran.

=== Revolution and hiatus (1979-2000) ===
At the time of the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Googoosh was in Los Angeles. However, feeling homesick, she decided to return to Iran. In response to why she remained in Iran after the revolution, she said that it was &quot;out of love of her for her homeland&quot;. Despite being a symbol of many things that the revolution tried to overturn, especially related to perceptions of excessive Westernization, Googoosh remained in Iran for years afterward. After the revolution, Googoosh, like other artists, was forbidden from performing and her material was banned. She did not perform again until Mohammad Khatami&#x27;s presidency, during which she was allowed to tour outside of the country.

=== Departure from Iran and comeback (2000-present) ===
Googoosh left Iran and went to Canada in 2000, after being in Iran for 21 years following the Iranian Revolution. BMusic&#x27;s Taghinia, says &quot;Googoosh is the siren of that era [Pre-revolution] and important in that she&#x27;s really a direct link to Iran&#x27;s past.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; considers the return of Googoosh to be &quot;more than just a pop milestone&quot; but instead &quot;a cultural marker, a measure of the way change occurs in a society that for more than two decades has tried to resist the tide of globalization by living in self-imposed isolation.&quot;

She released her first album after her comeback called &quot;Zartosht&quot; (Zoroaster) in 2000 with lyrics by Masoud Kimiaei (under the pseudonym Nosrat Farzaneh) and composed and arranged by Babak Amini and Babak Bayat.

In 2000, Googoosh sang in public, away from her homeland, for the first time after 21 years of silence to the acclaim of many long-time fans. The &quot;Googoosh Comeback Tour&quot; was a series of concerts starting in July 2000. She began with a sold-out concert at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto on 29 July 2000 (with an audience of more than 12,000), and eventually brought the tour to a conclusion in Dubai on 21 and 24 March 2001 on the occasion of the Iranian New Year, Nowruz. Her concert in Dubai was considered a homecoming for her, and out of the more than 20,000 members of the audience, seventy percent of them were Iranians who had crossed the Persian Gulf to hear her. The two Dubai concerts held special importance: it was the tour finale, and Googoosh was rumored to be planning to return to Iran.

In 2000, a feature-length documentary called &quot;Googoosh: Iran&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was released which chronicled the singer&#x27;s life and her icon-status while detailing the socio-political turmoil that led to the 1979 Revolution in Iran. Made by Iranian-American filmmaker Farhad Zamani, the documentary began production in 1998 and was made at a time when Googoosh was still forbidden to give interviews.

Gogoosh started collaborating with Mehrdad Asemani with &quot;QQ Bang Bang&quot; (2003). They continued their collaborating in the albums &quot;Akharin Khabar&quot; (2004), &quot;Manifest&quot; (2005) and &quot;Shabe Sepid&quot; (2008). Most of the lyrics of these albums were by Shahyar Ghanbari.

Beginning in 2011, she served as head-of-academy and head-judge alongside Hooman Khalatbari and Babak Saeedi for the widely popular talent show/singing competition &quot;Googoosh Music Academy&quot;, which was broadcast on the London-based Iranian satellite channel Manoto 1 and was their most watched program. Googoosh Music Academy lasted three seasons. In December 2010, Googoosh held a very notable concert in the Kurdish region of Iraq, to which tens of thousands of Iranians came from Tehran and beyond.

In 2010, Googoosh ran a Persian talent competition show called &quot;Googoosh Music Academy.&quot; The series ran in Europe and Middle East on Monoto TV channes.

Gogoosh released the album &quot;Hajme Sabz&quot; (Green X) in 2010. She said: &quot;I have tried to have works from different composers and songwriters in this new album&quot;. Gogoosh chose the name &quot;Aasheghaaneh&quot; for this album, but because of her interest in the book &quot;Hajme Sabz&quot; (The Green Space) by Sohrab Sepehri, she changed the name of the album. She released her old song &quot;Mano Gonjeshkaye Khooneh&quot; with a new arrangement by Babak Amini in this album.

In March 2011, Googoosh released a snippet of a new song she was working on, titled &quot;Bedrood&quot;, via YouTube. In April 2011, she debuted her latest project. The singer launched her own cosmetic collection sold online, titled &quot;Googoosh Cosmetics&quot;. In April 2011, she held a concert at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, as well as a record breaking performance at the same venue on 27 October 2012, as a part of her worldwide &quot;Ejaz&quot; Tour. Also on 26 March 2013 she performed at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall for the first time.

In 2012, Googoosh released her 6th studio album since her comeback, titled &quot;Ejaz&quot;. The album consisted of 10 tracks, featuring collaborations with Hassan Shamaizadeh (&quot;Hayahoo&quot;) and three songs wherein she collaborated with her fellow &quot;Googoosh Music Academy&quot; judge Babak Saeedi and with Raha Etemadi (&quot;Nagoo Bedrood&quot; and &quot;Noghteye Payan&quot; and &quot;Hese Mobham&quot;). She also collaborated with Alireza Afkari and Roozbeh Bemani on three songs (&quot;E&#x27;jaz&quot; and &quot;Baraye Man&quot; and &quot;Behesht&quot;). Another single &quot;Bi Manoto&quot; was a musical rendition of a poem by the Persian poet Rumi. The poem came to Googoosh&#x27;s attention while she was banned from singing at the time of the Iran–Iraq War. She stated that she felt inspired by the lyrics and therefore created her own melody and was finally presented with the opportunity to record it as she had long hoped to do.

In February 2014, she released a music video of the song &quot;Behesht&quot;, in support of the gay and lesbian community in Iran, which faces significant challenges in its struggle for equal rights, including the ongoing threat of the death penalty for convictions related to sexual orientation. This made her the first prominent Iranian with a huge following to speak out against homophobia in Iran.

In the same year, Gogoosh released a joint single with Ebi called &quot;Nostalgia.&quot; She started a joint world tour with Ebi with the same name, in which each of them sang some solo songs and some songs together.

On 21 March 2015, Googoosh released her 7th album titled &quot;Aks-e Khosoosi&quot; (&quot;Private Portrait&quot;) including 11 tracks from different songwriters and composers such as Babak Sahraee, Nickan Ebrahimi, Babak Amini (Googoosh band leader). The first song of this album is &quot;Che Ziba Bood&quot;, which is also the last song that was composed by Varujan. Gogoosh sang the old tasnif &quot;Morghe-e Sahar&quot; in this album.

In 2017, Googoosh started a world tour called &quot;The Memory Makers&quot; with Hassan Shamaizadeh and Ardalan Sarfraz. In the Los Angeles concert of this tour, Ardalan Sarfraz could not attend and Martik was present in this concert.

In 2018, Gogoosh released a single song in collaboration with Martik called &quot;Refaghat&quot;, and after positive feedback, she collaborated with Martik in two other songs called &quot;Eshghe Kamyab&quot; and &quot;Asheghet Hastam&quot;.

Gogoosh released her last album named &quot;Twenty One&quot; in 2021 with the composition of Siavash Ghomayshi and the lyrics of Raha Etamadi. During production, the trio tested positive for COVID-19.

On 14 September 2023, Gogoosh published a video on her official pages in the social media, in which she announced that her new tour (Final Chapter) is her last world tour and a farewell tour.

In 2024, a documentary about Googoosh, featuring her own presence, titled &quot;Googoosh – Made of Fire&quot;, was released in cinemas in Germany.

Despite the political and personal hardships she has endured, Googoosh has continued to be a beloved figure over the last half century.

==Politics==
Googoosh and other speakers participated in a 22 July 2009 protest at the United Nations which attracted exiles from Iran. They stood in front of a banner with names of Iranian protestors who they believed were still incarcerated and of other protestors, written in red, who had been killed. During this protest, Googoosh made a speech stating that she entered politics because of the outcome of the 2009 Iranian presidential election. She said, &quot;I have come here to be the voice for the sad mothers who lost their loved ones in peaceful demonstrations. I have come here to be the just voice of the grass-roots and spontaneous movement among my compatriots and to show my solidarity.&quot;

In 2018, Gogoosh and Siavash Ghomayshi released the political song &quot;40 Saal&quot; in criticism of the Islamic Republic.

Googoosh dedicated her Frankfurt 2022 concert to Mahsa Amini. She released song &quot;Dobareh&quot; in support of Iranian protests. She said at the gathering of Iranians in Washington: &quot;Today I feel proud and angry, but I am still more hopeful than ever about the future of Iran, and I focus my anger on that obsessively hateful and resentful leader and the child-killing government.&quot;

==Personal life==

Googoosh has three half-brothers on her father&#x27;s side and a brother and sister on her mother&#x27;s side. One of her brothers died in his youth.

In 1980, Googoosh was imprisoned for nearly one month after the Iranian Revolution. In 2018, in reply to a question by interviewer about how she stays young, she said, &quot;Love, music and lots of fruit!&quot;.

=== Marriages ===

Googoosh&#x27;s first husband was Mahmoud Ghorbani, a cabaret owner and music promoter who helped Googoosh make a name for herself in the 1960s. Googoosh and Ghorbani married in February 1967. They had a son, Kambiz. After about six years of marriage, Ghorbani and Googoosh divorced in late 1972.

In 1975, Googoosh married Iranian actor Behrouz Vossoughi; they divorced fourteen months later in 1976. During their brief marriage they were considered to be the country&#x27;s biggest celebrity power couple. During the late 1970s, Googoosh became involved with Homayoun Mesdaghi, and married him in 1979. Six years later, in 1985, she divorced Mesdaghi. She then married director Masoud Kimiai in 1991. They divorced in 2003.

=== Religious beliefs ===

Googoosh said: &quot;I used to pray every day until 2004.&quot;

In her interview with Homa Sarshar in 2022, she stated that she used to have beliefs, but her beliefs were &quot;broken&quot;.

In 2023, she posted a video on her official YouTube page and Instagram from one of her concerts, in which she explains that she uses &quot;God&quot; instead of &quot;Kaaba&quot; in the performance of the song &quot;Marham&quot; due to distance from religion. Gogoosh had previously explained in Manoto&#x27;s &quot;Behtarinhaye Behtarinha&quot; that she requested this lyrics from Ardalan Sarfraz after her pilgrimage to Mecca.

<text>Destin–Fort Walton Beach Airport is an airport located within [[Eglin Air Force Base]], adjacent to the city of Valparaiso and near the cities of Destin and Fort Walton Beach, in Okaloosa County, Florida, United States. The airport was previously named Northwest Florida Regional Airport until February 17, 2015, and Okaloosa Regional Airport until September 2008.

The airport is just under 16 miles away from Destin and takes approximately 25 minutes to get to Destin. Only commercial air traffic is allowed. Non-commercial operations by general aviation and business aircraft must use nearby Destin Executive Airport.

==History==
In 1957, The Okaloosa County Air Terminal opened on Eglin Air Force Base in building 89 with 3 personnel (Airport Manager, Security and Admin Support). Southern Airways was the only passenger airline, with Douglas DC-3s direct to Atlanta via several stops. Passengers entered the base through the East Gate near Valparaiso, thus the airport code of VPS. Southern would later upgrade their service into the airport with 40-passenger Martin 404 propliners before initiating the first scheduled passenger jet flights at VPS.

1967: Southern Airways introduced Douglas DC-9-10 jetliner service into VPS thus becoming the first airline to operate jets into the airport.

1968: According to the September 3, 1968, Southern Airways system timetable, the airline was operating daily nonstop DC-9-10 jet service to Atlanta and New Orleans with direct, no change of plane DC-9 jet flights twice a day to New York City LaGuardia Airport and Washington D.C. Dulles Airport via intermediate stops in Dothan, AL and Columbus, GA.

February 1975: The new James E. Plew Terminal Building of the Okaloosa Air Terminal, on State Road 85, opened in mid-February 1975, with dedication on 22 February. Representative Bob Sikes and Southern Airways President Frank Hulse were some of the speakers. The 32,000 sq ft (3,000 m2) facility cost $1.7 million. Federal grants totaled $472,000, state $80,000, Okaloosa County bond sale $1.1 million, and Southern Airways $190,000. First year enplaned passengers totaled 97,000 with Southern Airways as the sole airline serving VPS with 12 departing flights daily.

1977: South Central Air Transport (SCAT), a commuter air carrier, was serving the airport with flights to New Orleans, LA, Mobile, AL, Montgomery, AL and Panama City, FL flown with Handley Page Jetstream propjets.

1979: On July 1, 1979 Southern Airways merged with North Central Airlines to form Republic Airlines. In July 1979 Republic flew Douglas DC-9-10 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jets nonstop from VPS to Atlanta, GA; Dothan, AL; Mobile, AL; New Orleans, LA; Orlando, FL and Tallahassee, FL. Republic also operated direct DC-9 jet service to Baton Rouge, LA; Chicago, IL (O&#x27;Hare Airport), Fort Lauderdale, FL; Memphis, TN; Monroe, LA; New York (LaGuardia Airport) and Washington D.C. (Dulles Airport). Prior to the merger Southern flew all of these nonstop and direct DC-9 routes as well and also operated direct DC-9 jet service to Birmingham, AL; Miami, FL and Nashville, TN.

1980s: At the beginning of the 1980s, only Republic Airlines was operating nonstop service between VPS and Atlanta. Republic was operating DC-9-10, DC-9-30 and DC-9-50 jets on the route. As the decade progressed, Delta Air Lines and Eastern Air Lines both added nonstop service between the airport and Atlanta via their respective regional airline code sharing partners, Delta Connection and Eastern Metro Express, both of which operated turboprop aircraft into VPS. The Delta Connection service was flown by Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA) operating de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 and Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprops. The Eastern Metro Express service was flown by Metro Airlines operating British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 and de Havilland Canada DHC-8-100 Dash 8 turboprops. Air New Orleans, a commuter airline, also served VPS during the 1980s with commuter aircraft such as the Beechcraft C99 turboprop and Piper prop aircraft. Destinations served by Air New Orleans from VPS included Birmingham, AL; Mobile, AL; New Orleans, LA; Orlando, FL; Panama City, FL; Pensacola, FL and Tampa, FL.

1986–1987: On October 1, 1986, Northwest Airlines completed its merger with Republic Airlines. Northwest flew only one route from VPS: nonstop to Memphis, a Northwest hub which was also a former Republic and Southern Airways hub. By September 1987 Northwest had four non-stops a day to Memphis with stretched McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 and DC-9-50s. Later Northwest would reduce its schedule from VPS to three daily DC-9s nonstop to Memphis. No other airline flew jets into VPS until Valujet/Airtran appeared in the 1990s.

1998: AirTran Airways was serving the airport at this time with jet service. According to the August 1, 1998 AirTran system timetable, two nonstop flights a day were operated to Atlanta with direct, one stop service once a day to Washington, D.C. Dulles Airport. AirTran operated McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners into VPS. However, by the end of 2001, AirTran had ceased all service into the airport after commencing service to Pensacola.

November 2004: The current Northwest Florida Regional Airport opened its doors following an expansion with more parking, a larger aircraft parking apron, a second parallel taxiway, landscaping and a new passenger terminal.

January 2010: Delta Air Lines completed its merger with Northwest Airlines on January 31, 2010. Delta then scaled back the Northwest hub operation in Memphis, and service between VPS and MEM was discontinued in favor of nonstop flights to Delta&#x27;s hub in Atlanta.

2011: Vision Airlines began a small scheduled passenger hub operation at VPS with flights to Asheville, NC; Atlanta, GA; Baton Rouge, LA; Columbia, SC; Fort Lauderdale, FL; Fort Myers, FL; Greenville/Spartanburg, SC; Huntsville, AL; Knoxville, TN; Lafayette, LA; Las Vegas, NV; Little Rock, AR; Louisville, KY; Sanford/Orlando, FL; Savannah, GA; Shreveport, LA; St. Louis, MO; and St. Petersburg, FL. Vision flew Boeing 737 jetliners and Dornier 328 turboprops. Vision later ended all flights at the airport and shut down its VPS hub.

February 17, 2015: Northwest Florida Regional Airport changed its name to Destin–Fort Walton Beach Airport on a 3–2 vote.

March 2016 : GLO Airlines began less than daily, seasonal service from VPS to Little Rock (LIT) and New Orleans (MSY) using 30-seat Saab 340B turboprop aircraft. GLO has since ceased all flights and is no longer in business.

May/June 2016: Allegiant Air began scheduled service to VPS from Cincinnati (CVG), Ft Lauderdale (FLL), Oklahoma City (OKC), Knoxville (TYS), Memphis (MEM) and St Louis/Belleville (BLV) flying Airbus A319, A320, and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 mainline jet aircraft. The Destin–Fort Walton Beach Airport became a focus city for the airline at this time.

September 2016: Contour Airlines began flying less than daily, seasonal service from Bowling Green, KY (BWG) to VPS using 30-seat British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 41 turboprop aircraft. These flights ended in 2018 due to low demand.

January 2017: Allegiant Air announced a major expansion with a new base of operations to be located on the airport with a total of eighteen (18) domestic destinations to be served nonstop on seasonal basis with mainline jet aircraft by June 2017 with most of the planned new service to begin in May 2017.

May 2019: Silver Airways began daily service to Orlando, FL (MCO) from VPS using a 34-seat Saab 340 turboprop aircraft. Silver stopped serving VPS in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

May 6, 2021: Southwest Airlines began service to VPS with flights to Dallas-Love (DAL), Nashville (BNA), Baltimore/Washington (BWI) and Chicago/Midway (MDW).

March 2022: United Airlines announces that they would cease all flights into VPS, citing long-term unsustainability.

September 19, 2022: Concourse C expansion opens for exclusive use by Allegiant Air, flying to 35 destinations.

February 6, 2024: Avelo Airlines announces service to Tweed-New Haven Airport (HVN) in Connecticut, starting on May 17, 2024.

==Facilities==

Destin–Fort Walton Beach Airport and Eglin AFB covers 6,500 acres (2,630 ha) and share two runways: 12/30 is asphalt/concrete and 02/20 is asphalt.

===Terminal===
The airport has a passenger terminal with five second-level gates with passenger jet ways and three ground-level commuter gates with passenger jet ways.

The two-level terminal opened in November 2004. The old terminal building was demolished soon after. The terminal has areas for ticketing and baggage claim and upper and lower courses with gates. The first level has Gates A1, A2, and A3 and waiting areas and a concession area. The second-level concourse has Gates B1, B2, B3, B4, B5 and B6. B3 is rarely used due to a lack of flights during the slow season. B5 is rarely used due to a lack of a jetway. Passengers have to descend a narrow stairwell and isn&#x27;t very conducive to safe and speedy boarding of the aircraft. The second-level concourse also has a restaurant and concession areas. The terminal was designed to allow future expansion. Concourse C, completed in 2022 for Allegiant Air&#x27;s exclusive use, is located to the west of the main terminal. The $11.4 million-dollar, 26,000 square foot expansion includes 5 new ground-level gates, along with multiple food and beverage options. However, passengers will still have to check in, as well as collect baggage, at the main terminal.

===Ground transportation===
Access to the terminal is off of State Road 85. Parking facilities are to the left, the terminal or loop is straight ahead and rental car return is to the right. The airport loop road has two pass-through lanes on the left and three arrival-departure lanes in front of the terminal. The loop road is a two-lane asphalt roadway about ¾ mile long. Short-term and long-term parking facilities are available. The parking facilities were improved in the early 2000s (decade) as part of the new terminal expansion. These were designed with the Transportation Security Administration&#x27;s &quot;300-foot rule&quot; in mind, and satisfy the distance between parked vehicles and the terminal building.

<text>Mercedes de Acosta (March 1, 1892 – May 9, 1968) was an American poet, playwright, and novelist. Although she failed to achieve artistic and professional distinction, de Acosta is known for her many lesbian affairs with celebrated Broadway and Hollywood personalities including Alla Nazimova, Isadora Duncan, Eva Le Gallienne, and Marlene Dietrich. Her best-known involvement was with Greta Garbo with whom, in 1931, she began a sporadic and volatile romance. Her 1960 memoir, &quot;Here Lies the Heart&quot;, is considered part of gay history insofar that it hints at the lesbian element in some of her relationships.

==Background==
She was born in New York City on March 1, 1892. Her father, Ricardo de Acosta, was born in Cuba to Spanish parents, and later immigrated to the United States. Her mother, Micaela Hernández de Alba y de Alba, was Spanish and allegedly a descendant of the Spanish Dukes of Alba. De Acosta had five siblings: Aida, Ricardo Jr., Angela, Maria, and Rita. Maria married the socially prominent landscape architect A. Robeson Sargent, son of Harvard botanist Charles Sprague Sargent. Rita became a famous beauty known as Rita Lydig. De Acosta attended elementary 
school at the Convent of the Blessed Sacrament on West 79th Street in Manhattan where Dorothy Parker was a classmate.

De Acosta married painter Abram Poole (January 12, 1882 – May 24, 1961) in 1920. They divorced in 1935.

She was described in 1955 by Garbo biographer, John Bainbridge, as &quot;a woman of courtly manners, impeccable decorative taste and great personal elegance... a woman with a passionate and intense devotion to the art of living... and endowed with a high spirit, energy, eclectic curiosity and a varied interest in the arts.&quot;

==Personal life==
De Acosta was involved in numerous lesbian relationships with Broadway&#x27;s and Hollywood&#x27;s elite and she did not attempt to hide her sexuality; her uncloseted existence was rare and daring in her generation. In 1916 she began an affair with actress Alla Nazimova and later with dancer Isadora Duncan. Shortly after marrying Abram Poole in 1920, de Acosta became involved in a five-year relationship with actress Eva Le Gallienne. De Acosta wrote two plays for Le Gallienne, &quot;Sandro Botticelli&quot; and &quot;Jehanne de Arc&quot;. After the financial failures of both plays they ended their relationship.

Over the next decade, she was involved with several famous actresses and dancers, including Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Ona Munson, and Russian ballerina Tamara Platonovna Karsavina. 
Additional unsubstantiated rumors include affairs with Tallulah Bankhead, Pola Negri, Eleonora Duse, Katherine Cornell, and Alice B. Toklas, with an annoyed Bankhead regularly dubbing de Acosta as &quot;Countess Dracula&quot; following their alleged affair.

It has often been said that she once stated, &quot;I can get any woman away from any man,&quot; but there is no evidence to substantiate this claim.

An ardent liberal, de Acosta was committed to several political causes. Concerned about the Spanish Civil War, which began in 1936, for example, she supported the Republican government that opposed the Nationalist faction. A tireless advocate for women&#x27;s rights, she wrote in her memoir, &quot;I believed...in every form of independence for women and I was...an enrolled worker for women&#x27;s suffrage.&quot;

She also became a vegetarian and, out of respect for animals, refused to wear furs.

===Relationship with Greta Garbo===
De Acosta&#x27;s best-known relationship was with Greta Garbo. When Garbo&#x27;s close friend, author Salka Viertel, introduced them in 1931, they quickly became involved. As their relationship developed, it became erratic and volatile with Garbo always in control. The two were very close sporadically and then apart for lengthy periods when Garbo, annoyed by Mercedes&#x27; obsessive behavior, coupled with her own neuroses, ignored her. In any case, they remained friends for thirty years during which time Garbo wrote de Acosta 181 letters, cards, and telegrams. About their friendship, Cecil Beaton, who was close to both women, recorded in his 1958 memoir, &quot;Mercedes is [Garbo&#x27;s] very best friend and for 30 years has stood by her, willing to devote her life to her&quot;.

Although it has been argued that an intimate relationship between them cannot be proved, de Acosta states they were lovers. Contrary to legend, she did not do so in her memoir. In 1959, when she was destitute, de Acosta sold her papers to the Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library in Philadelphia and claims to have reluctantly included romantic letters from Garbo. &quot;I would not have had the heart or courage to have burned these letters&quot;, she wrote William McCarthy, curator of the museum. &quot;I mean, of course, Eva [&quot;sic&quot;], Greta&#x27;s and Marlene&#x27;s who were lovers... I only hope... they will be respected and protected from the eyes of vulgar people&quot;. All of Garbo&#x27;s and de Acosta&#x27;s recent biographers, moreover, discuss their involvement. Per de Acosta&#x27;s request, Garbo&#x27;s letters were made available to the public in 2000, ten years after her death, and none were explicitly romantic. However, Garbo&#x27;s family, which controls her estate, has permitted only 87 of 181 letters to be made public.

===Interest in eastern spirituality===
In the early 1930s de Acosta developed an interest in Hinduism and was encouraged to seek out Indian mystic Meher Baba when he arrived in Hollywood. For several years she was captivated by his philosophy and methods and he often gave her advice about ways to address her problems. Later, she studied the philosophy of Hindu sage Ramana Maharishi who introduced her to yoga, meditation, and other spiritual practices she hoped would help ease her suffering. In 1938, she met Hindu dancer Ram Gopal in Hollywood. They immediately established a rapport and became close lifelong friends. Later that year they traveled to India to meet Maharishi.

When asked about religion, de Acosta once said that although she had grown up Catholic, she would be, if she had to be anything, a Buddhist.

== The Sewing Circle ==
Sewing circle is also the phrase used (by Marlene Dietrich, for instance) to describe the group of lesbian and bisexual woman writers and actresses, such as Mercedes de Acosta and Tallulah Bankhead, and their relationships in celebrity circles and in Hollywood, United States, particularly during Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age from the 1910s to the 1950s. Unlike de Acosta and Bankhead, most members of the sewing circle were closeted. This usage of the term &quot;sewing circle&quot; was coined by the actress Alla Nazimova.

==Later life, controversial autobiography and death==
In 1960, when de Acosta was seriously ill with a brain tumor and in need of money, she published her memoir, &quot;Here Lies the Heart&quot;. The book was well-received by the critics and many close friends praised the book. 
But its implied homosexuality resulted in the severance of several friendships with women who felt she had betrayed their sexuality. Garbo ended their friendship at this time. Eva Le Gallienne in particular was furious, denouncing de Acosta as a liar and stating that she invented the stories for fame. This characterization is inaccurate since many of her affairs and relationships with women, including that with Le Gallienne, are confirmed in personal correspondence.

An exception to this was Marlene Dietrich, who continued to correspond with her and loved the book. According to critic Patricia White, &quot;If she craved being seen, MdA was more careful about what she said than she is given credit for. She wrote a name-dropping memoir, but for something attacked for exaggeration, it barely alludes to homosexuality&quot;. In any case, she gained a reputation that was not appreciated by everyone. But as Alice B. Toklas, lover of Gertrude Stein and de Acosta&#x27;s long-term friend, wrote to a disapproving critic, &quot;Say what you will about Mercedes, she&#x27;s had the most important women of the twentieth century&quot;.

De Acosta died at age 76 in poverty in New York City. She is buried at Trinity Cemetery in Washington Heights, New York City.

==Legacy==
De Acosta has usually been described disparagingly, dismissed as a &quot;notorious lesbian&quot; who was a dishonest nuisance to her lovers and who consistently &quot;stalked&quot; Garbo. Garbo&#x27;s biographers, for example, assess their relationship from Garbo&#x27;s perspective in which Garbo is fundamentally blameless in their difficult relationship, a perpetual victim of de Acosta&#x27;s alleged irksome behavior. But Robert A. Schanke, de Acosta&#x27;s recent biographer, attempts, on the basis of extensive research, to provide an accurate picture of her. She was, Schanke acknowledges, flawed and imperfect, a complex woman who impaired several of her relationships and failed to achieve her professional and romantic aspirations. But he reveals her to have been an exceptionally lively, intelligent, and dynamic person who had many devoted friends. She was, he argues, a brave lesbian of her times and a person of integrity who remained kind and loyal to most everyone with whom she crossed paths. He suggests that the many denigrating portrayals of her may derive from the deep homophobia of her generation.

She has been accused of fabricating incidents in her memoir and lacing it with half-truths and fantasies. She herself confessed, &quot;I may have made mistakes in some dates or minor incidents but…I feel I have held to the spirit of my statement if not to the letter&quot;. Nevertheless, Karen Swenson, a Garbo biographer, and Schanke identified and corrected significant errors in de Acosta&#x27;s account. While the memoir was initially unsuccessful, it was rediscovered in the late 1960s and widely read in the underground gay community. In spite of its inaccuracies, it is now recognized as an important contribution to gay and lesbian history.

Her poetic work consists mainly of three books published during her life: &quot;Moods&quot; (prose poems) (1919), &quot;Archways of Life&quot; (1921), and &quot;Streets and Shadows&quot; (1922). A comprehensive compilation of these three books appeared, for the first time, in Spanish translation under the title &quot;Imposeída (46 poemas)&quot; (Las Cruces, NM: Eds. La Mirada, 2016, ), edited by Jesús J. Barquet and Carlota Caulfield. Barquet and Caulfield wrote the introduction to the book (&quot;Mercedes de Acosta en traje de poeta&quot;) and, along with Joaquín Badajoz, authored the Spanish translations. In 2017, &quot;Imposeida&quot; was republished by Ediciones Holguin (), in Cuba; and in 2018 an expanded and revised version appeared in bilingual (English/Spanish) format in Ediciones Torremozas (), in Madrid.

Composer Joseph Hallman memorialized de Acosta in the song cycle &quot;Raving Beauty&quot; for flute, harp, cello, and soprano. The song cycle was based on the correspondence and ephemera held in the de Acosta collection at the Rosenbach Museum. The work deals with her relationships and correspondences with Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Isadora Duncan, Igor Stravinsky, and others. Commissioned by the Philadelphia International Festival for the Arts, it has been performed many times, including by the Secret Opera.

<doc id="287466" wikidata="Q9896" url="?curid=287466" title="Pesto">
<text>Pesto () or more fully pesto alla genovese (; ) is a paste made of crushed garlic, pine nuts, salt, basil leaves, grated cheese such as Parmesan or &quot;pecorino sardo,&quot; and olive oil. It originated in the Italian city of Genoa, and is used to dress pasta and flavour genoese minestrone soup.

==Etymology==
The name pesto is the past participle of the Genoese verb (Italian: ), meaning &#x27;to pound&#x27;, &#x27;to crush&#x27;: the ingredients are &quot;crushed&quot; or ground in a marble mortar through a circular motion of a wooden pestle. The same Latin root gives us &quot;pestle&quot;. There are other foods called &quot;pesto&quot;, but &quot;pesto&quot; by itself usually means &quot;pesto alla genovese&quot;.

==History==

Pesto is thought to have had two predecessors in ancient times, going back as far as the Roman age. The ancient Romans used to eat a similar paste called &quot;moretum&quot;, which was made by crushing garlic, salt, cheese, herbs, olive oil, and vinegar (and sometimes pine nuts) together. The use of this paste in the Roman cuisine is mentioned in the &quot;Appendix Vergiliana&quot;, an ancient collection of poems in which the author details the preparation of &quot;moretum&quot;. During the Middle Ages, a popular sauce in the Genoan cuisine was &quot;agliata&quot;, which was a mash of garlic and walnuts, as garlic was a staple in the nutrition of Ligurians, especially for the seafarers.

The introduction of basil, the main ingredient of modern pesto, occurred in more recent times and is first documented only from the 1850s. Emanuele Rossi published &quot;La Vera Cucineria Genovese&quot; in 1852 and gastronomist Giovanni Battista Ratto published &quot;La Cuciniera Genovese&quot; in 1863:

&quot;Take a clove of garlic, basil or, when that is lacking, marjoram and parsley, grated Dutch and Parmigiano cheese and mix them with pine nuts and crush it all together in a mortar with a little butter until reduced to a paste. Then dissolve it with good and abundant oil. Lasagne and trofie are dressed with this mash, made more liquid by adding a little hot water without salt.&quot;

Basil took the firmest root in the regions of Liguria, Italy, and Provence, France. It is abundant in these regions in season, and marjoram and parsley may be used when basil is out of season. Ratto mentions Dutch cheese (&quot;formaggio olandese&quot;) instead of &quot;pecorino sardo&quot;, since Northern European cheeses were common in Genoa at the time, thanks to the centuries-long commercial trades of the maritime republic.

This recipe for &quot;pesto alla genovese&quot; was often revised in the following years (a noted revision by Emanuele Rossi occurred in 1865, only a couple of years after Ratto&#x27;s &quot;Cuciniera&quot;), and it shortly became a staple in the Ligurian culinary tradition, with many variants.

An early American pesto recipe was published in 1928; it includes butter and cream. Imported, canned pesto was available by 1944. In 1946, &quot;Sunset&quot; magazine published a pesto recipe by Angelo Pellegrini. Pesto became popular in North America in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Ingredients and preparation==

Pesto is traditionally prepared in a marble mortar with a wooden pestle. First, garlic and pine nuts are placed in the mortar and reduced to a cream, and then the washed and dried basil leaves are added with coarse salt and ground to a creamy consistency. Only then is a mix of Parmesan and pecorino added. To help incorporate the cheese, a little extra-virgin olive oil is added. In a tight jar (or simply in an air-tight plastic container), covered by a layer of extra-virgin olive oil, pesto can last in the refrigerator for up to a week and can be frozen for later use.

===Accompaniments===

Pesto is commonly used on pasta, traditionally with &quot;mandilli de sæa&quot; (&#x27;silk handkerchiefs&#x27; in the Genoese dialect), trofie or &quot;trenette&quot;. Potatoes and string beans are also traditionally added to the dish, boiled in the same pot in which the pasta has been cooked. Pasta mixed with pesto has become a well-known dish in many countries today, with countless recipes available for &quot;pasta with pesto&quot;.

It is used in Genovese minestrone. Outside of Italy, pesto is sometimes served with sliced beef, tomatoes, and sliced boiled potatoes.

===Variations===
Pesto comes in a variety of recipes, some traditional and some modern, as the very noun &quot;pesto&quot; is a generic term for anything that is made by pounding.

The original &quot;pesto alla genovese&quot; is made with Genovese basil, coarse salt, garlic, Ligurian extra virgin olive oil (Taggiasco), European pine nuts (sometimes toasted), and a grated cheese such as Parmesan or Grana Padano and &quot;pecorino sardo&quot; or &quot;pecorino romano&quot;. A proposal is under preparation by the Palatifini Association to have &quot;pesto alla genovese&quot; included in the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage list. There is a biennial international Genovese Pesto al Mortaio competition, in which 100 finalists use traditional mortars and pestles as well as the above ingredients, which 30 local and international judges then assess.
There is a slightly different version in Provence, where it is known as &quot;pistou&quot; (from &quot;pistar&quot;, &#x27;to pound&#x27; in Occitan). &quot;Pistou&quot; is generally made with only olive oil, basil, and garlic, and not cheese, although some modern versions include it. Almonds or breadcrumbs can be used to give the final consistency. &quot;Pistou&quot; is used in the &quot;soupe au pistou&quot;, a hearty vegetable soup.

Outside of Italy, sometimes almond, Brazil, cashew, hazelnut, macadamia, pecan, pistachio, walnut, or even peanuts are used instead of pine nuts, and sometimes coriander, dill, kale, mint, parsley, rocket, spinach, or wild garlic leaves are mixed in with the basil leaves. Any combination of flavourful leaves, oily nuts, hard cheese, olive oil, garlic, salt, and lemon juice can produce a pesto-like condiment.

&quot;Pesto alla siciliana&quot;, sometimes called &quot;pesto rosso&quot; (red pesto), is a sauce from Sicily similar to &quot;pesto alla genovese&quot; but with the addition of fresh tomato and almonds instead of pine nuts, and much less basil.

&quot;Pesto alla calabrese&quot; is a sauce from Calabria consisting of (grilled) bell peppers, black pepper, and more; these ingredients give it a distinctively spicy taste.

Outside Italy, the name &quot;pesto&quot; has been used for all sorts of cold sauces or dips, mostly without any of the original ingredients: coriander, dill, kale, mint, parsley, rocket, spinach, or wild garlic (instead of or in addition to basil), artichokes, black olives, green olives, lemon peel, lime peel, or mushrooms. In more northern countries, ramson leaves are sometimes used instead of basil. In the 19th century, Genovese immigrants to Argentina brought pesto recipes with them. A Peruvian variety, known as &quot;tallarines verdes&quot; (meaning &#x27;green noodles&#x27;, from Italian ), is slightly creamier, lacks pine nuts (because of their rarity and prohibitive cost in Peru), may use spinach and vegetable oil (in place of olive oil), and is sometimes served with roasted potatoes and sirloin steak.

Vegan variations may substitute miso paste and nutritional yeast for cheese.

==Non-traditional variants of pesto==
For reasons of expense or availability, almond, Brazil nut, cashew, hazelnut, macadamia, pecan, pistachio, walnut, or even peanuts are sometimes substituted for the traditional pine nuts. Also, while the nuts are traditionally raw, some recipes call for prior toasting or roasting. Other nuts may be used due to the taste disturbances that some people may experience after consuming pine nuts (see pine mouth). Many online recipes in English for pesto include black pepper or white pepper, which are not present in the usual Genoese recipe. Prepared pesto sold in supermarkets often replaces the extra virgin olive oil with cheaper vegetable oils. Some manufacturers of pesto for European supermarkets also use fillers such as potato flakes or potato starch, which soften the strong flavour.
Certain pesto recipes abroad replace basil or pine nuts with other herbs and greens, such as:
* Coconut
* Avocado and parsley
* Carrots, coriander and cumin
* Turmeric
* Ginger
*Perilla leaf
*Spirulina
*Walnuts

<doc id="287468" wikidata="Q220619" url="?curid=287468" title="Elihu Root">
<text>Elihu Root (; February 15, 1845February 7, 1937) was an American lawyer, Republican politician, and statesman who served as the 41st United States Secretary of War under presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt and the 38th United States Secretary of State under Roosevelt. In both positions as well as a long legal career, he pioneered the American practice of international law. Root is sometimes considered the prototype of the 20th-century political &quot;wise man&quot;, advising presidents on a range of foreign and domestic issues. He also served as a United States Senator from New York and received the 1912 Nobel Peace Prize.

Root was a leading New York City lawyer who moved frequently between high-level appointed government positions in Washington, D.C., and private-sector legal practice in New York. He headed organizations such as the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the American Society of International Law.

As Secretary of War from 1899 to 1904, Root administered colonial possessions won in the Spanish–American War. Root favored a paternalistic approach to colonial administration, emphasizing technology, engineering, and disinterested public service. He helped craft the Foraker Act of 1900, the Platt Amendment of 1901, and the Philippine Organic Act (1902). Root also modernized the Army into a professional military apparatus with a general staff, restructured the National Guard, and established the U.S. Army War College.

Root returned to the Roosevelt administration as Secretary of State from 1905 to 1909. He modernized the consular service by minimizing patronage, maintained the Open Door Policy in China, promoted friendly relations with Latin America, and resolved frictions with Japan over the immigration and treatment of Japanese citizens to the West Coast of the United States. He negotiated 24 bilateral international arbitration treaties, which led to the creation of the Permanent Court of International Justice.

As a United States Senator from New York, Root was a conservative supporter of President William Howard Taft, playing a central role in Taft&#x27;s nomination to a second term at the 1912 Republican National Convention. By 1916, he was a leading proponent of military preparedness with the expectation that the United States would enter World War I. President Woodrow Wilson sent him to Russia in 1917 in an unsuccessful effort to establish an alliance with the new revolutionary government that had replaced the Czar. Root supported Wilson&#x27;s vision of the League of Nations but with reservations along the lines proposed by Republican senator Henry Cabot Lodge.

==Early life and education==
Elihu Root was born on February 15, 1845, in Clinton, Oneida County, New York, to Oren Root and Nancy Whitney Buttrick, both of English descent. His father was a professor of mathematics at Hamilton College.

Elihu studied at local schools, including the Clinton Grammar School and the Williston Seminary, where he was a classmate of G. Stanley Hall, before enrolling at Hamilton. He joined the Sigma Phi Society and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa society. After graduation, Root was an instructor of physical education for two years at Williston Seminary and taught for one year at the Rome Free Academy.

Despite his parents&#x27; encouragement to become a Presbyterian minister, Root moved to New York City in 1865 with his brother Wally and sought a career in the law. He enrolled at New York University School of Law and earned money teaching American history at elite girls&#x27; schools. At the time, most law students in the United States applied for admission to the bar after one year of study, but Root stayed on for a second year, essentially a private tutelage under Professor John Norton Pomeroy. He graduated in 1867 with a Bachelor of Laws and was admitted to the bar on June 18, 1867.

==Legal and business career==
Upon his admission to the bar, Root completed a year of unpaid apprenticeship at the leading New York City firm Mann and Parsons. In 1868, he and several other young lawyers founded the firm of Strahan &amp; Root with offices on Pine Street. He had various partners through 1897, when a disagreement led to the dissolution of his firm and the formation of Root, Howard, Winthrop &amp; Stimson, a predecessor of the modern firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman.

His early work was assorted and menial, but expanded rapidly after he met John J. Donaldson, the president of the Bank of North America, through their pastor. Donaldson hired Root as a Latin tutor and was impressed with his ability as a lawyer, eventually sending him personal matters and small cases for the Bank. In March 1869, Root was hired to reorganize the bank to acquire a state charter. Soon after, Alexander Compton was elevated to the partnership, and the firm was renamed Compton &amp; Root. Root&#x27;s public profile and professional reputation were enhanced by his defense of Tammany Hall boss William M. Tweed, and Compton &amp; Root grew throughout the 1870s into a varied practice with a primary focus on banks, railroads, wills and estates, and municipal government.

Root was admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1881. In 1883, President Chester A. Arthur appointed him U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the chief government attorney in New York City. As U.S. Attorney, Root headed the prosecutions for the Ward and Grant fraud which precipitated the Panic of 1884.

Through 1899, Root took on many other prominent and wealthy clients, including Jay Gould, Chester A. Arthur, Charles Anderson Dana, William C. Whitney, Thomas Fortune Ryan, the Havemeyer family, Charlie Delmonico, and E. H. Harriman. In 1889, Root advised Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Thomas Brackett Reed on his controversial efforts to revise the House rules.

On January 19, 1898, Root was elected a member of the executive committee of the newly formed North American Trust Company.

After moving to Washington in 1899, Root never again became partner in a firm. His public career lasted through 1915, when Root returned to practice in an of counsel role at his son&#x27;s firm of Root, Clark, Buckner &amp; Howland. Around that time, Root was elected the 38th president of the American Bar Association.

===Defense of Tweed ring===
In December 1871, Tammany Hall boss William M. Tweed was indicted on charges of deceit and fraud in connection to his real estate dealings and political corruption. Tweed retained eminent defense counsel led by David Dudley Field; Root joined the case on behalf of Tweed&#x27;s co-defendant James Ingersoll, a furniture manufacturer who stood accused of fraudulently billing the city government for millions of dollars. Root&#x27;s law partner, Alexander Compton, was Ingersoll&#x27;s cousin by marriage, and Compton turned the case over to Root due to his courtroom experience. Despite his family&#x27;s dismay, he accepted the case and joined Tweed&#x27;s defense in addition to Ingersoll&#x27;s.

The Tweed case stretched on for years, with the first trial commencing more than fifteen months after the indictment and ending in a hung jury. Four more indictments were brought in November 1873 after the defense&#x27;s failed attempt to get judge Noah Davis to recuse himself. Root took a minor role in the proceedings, examining jurors and occasionally cross-examining the prosecution witnesses. The jury returned a guilty verdict on two hundred and four counts; Davis imposed a sentence of twelve years and a $12,750 fine, later reduced on appeal. Three of Tweed&#x27;s attorneys were fined for contempt of court; Root was not among them. Instead, Davis addressed the junior attorneys:

&quot;I know how young lawyers are apt to follow their seniors. ... [Elihu Root and Willard Bartlett] displayed great ability during the trial. I shall impose no penalty, except what they may find in these few words of advice: I ask you young gentlemen, to remember that good faith to a client never can justify or require bad faith to your own consciences, and that however good a thing it may be to be known as successful and great lawyers, it is even a better thing to be known as honest men.&quot;

Root took a more active role in the Ingersoll defense, successfully appealing a jurisdictional issue to the New York Court of Appeals. Judge Allen remarked to Root&#x27;s co-counsel that Root&#x27;s argument &quot;was not excelled by any in the case.&quot; Ingersoll was ultimately sentenced to five years but was pardoned by Governor Samuel J. Tilden.

After Root had risen to national prominence, his work on the Tweed case formed the basis for public attacks from newspapers owned and directed by William Randolph Hearst, particularly after Root opposed Hearst&#x27;s 1906 campaign for governor. Hearst exaggerated Root&#x27;s role in the case and implied he had advised Tweed on political corruption before his indictment. Root&#x27;s fee in the case, paid partly in cash and partly by a real estate transfer, also came in for criticism, with Hearst papers implying that Root had inherited Tweed&#x27;s mansion. In fact, Tweed was penniless after paying the fines assessed against him, and his heavily encumbered real estate holdings were his lone assets.

===U.S. Attorney for the Southern District (1883–85)===

Early in his legal career, Root joined the Union League Club, where he met a number of young New York Republicans. He avoided political office personally, believing that it would obstruct his legal career. As an example, he cited Robert H. Strahan, an early law partner who had entered state politics. &quot;It ruined him as a lawyer,&quot; Root said in 1930. &quot;He got in the habit politicians have of sitting around and talking instead of working.&quot; Nevertheless, after his 1878 marriage and move to East 55th Street, Root became actively involved in the Republican Party organization in his well-to-do State Assembly district. He also expanded his involvement at the Union League Club, where his father-in-law was an active member. In 1879, he was elected to the Club&#x27;s executive committee.

Through the Club, Root met Chester A. Arthur, an experienced Manhattan attorney and the powerful Collector of the Port of New York. In 1879, Arthur and Alonzo B. Cornell persuaded Root to stand for the Court of Common Pleas. Root viewed the campaign as hopeless given the city&#x27;s Democratic reputation, took no part in the campaign, and was relieved to lose the election. He never again stood for a popular election, other than as a delegate to party conventions, but his association with Arthur rapidly advanced his national profile. In 1880, Arthur was elected Vice President of the United States with Root&#x27;s support. Root attended the inauguration and was among the friends at Arthur&#x27;s New York home on September 19, 1881, when the Vice President was informed that President James A. Garfield had succumbed to an assassin&#x27;s bullet and that he had succeeded to the presidency. In 1881, Root encountered another future President: Theodore Roosevelt, who was elected to the State Assembly from Root&#x27;s district. Root actively supported the young Roosevelt&#x27;s career by signing Roosevelt&#x27;s nomination papers, aiding in efforts to sideline a rival candidate, and speaking on behalf of his 1886 mayoral campaign.

Though many observers expected Arthur would offer Root appointment as Attorney General or to another cabinet post, in March 1883 he appointed Root United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. There was limited opposition to his nomination given that Arthur was trying to force out a political rival, Stewart L. Woodford, who had been appointed by Garfield, but he was approved by the Senate and sworn in on March 12. The role was part-time, with Root devoting his mornings to the Attorney&#x27;s office and his afternoons to his private practice. Many of his cases were suits for the refund of customs duties paid under protest.

====International law====
As U.S. Attorney, Root had his first exposure to international law, which would become the cornerstone of his public legacy. He prosecuted two cases for violation of United States neutrality laws against vessels for aiding Haitian and Colombian insurgents and defended the government in the Head Money Cases, a challenge to the Immigration Act of 1882 on grounds that it conflicted with international treaties with the Republic of the Netherlands. The suit was appealed to the Supreme Court, where the government prevailed.

====Ward and Grant prosecutions====
Root&#x27;s highest profile case as U.S. Attorney was the prosecution for embezzlement of James C. Fish, a partner in Ward and Grant, a Ponzi scheme trading on the name of former President Ulysses S. Grant and his son, Ulysses Jr. The collapse of Ward and Grant precipitated the Panic of 1884. Fish offered a defense of ignorance, claiming that he had been fooled by the scheme, just as the Grants had been. For six weeks, Root devoted his full attention to the case, including the deposition of former President Grant, who died before a verdict was reached. The jury returned a guilty verdict after a night of deliberation, and Fish was sentenced to ten years in prison.

The Fish verdict won Root praise in the press. According to the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, &quot;The manner in which he conducted the prosecution... has won him high praise wherever reports of the trial have been published. The cross-examination of the defendant was characterized by exceptional acumen and professional skill, and was made much more effective than it would otherwise have been by Mr. Root&#x27;s evident familiarity with the details of the banking business.&quot; The &quot;Mail and Express&quot; wrote: &quot;The credit of the result must be awarded mainly to the District Attorney.&quot; In particular, Root was credited with vindicating the late President: &quot;The unspeakable meanness of the conspirators in trying to save themselves by implicating General Grant in their fraudulent transactions... was dealt with in terms of deserved scorn and severity by the District Attorney.&quot;

Just before his resignation, Root successfully won an indictment of Fish&#x27;s co-conspirator, Ferdinand Ward. He quietly submitted his resignation to President Grover Cleveland on July 1, 1885. Two other members of the conspiracy were later prosecuted, and Root returned from private life to assist with the prosecutions.

==Secretary of War (1899–1904)==
In July 1899, President William McKinley offered Root a position in his cabinet as Secretary of War. The offer came on the heels of the Spanish–American War. In general, the war had been a success, but Secretary Russell A. Alger had come under heavy criticism for his management of the department, and McKinley had requested his resignation. At first, Root declined, but accepted when he realized &quot;McKinley wanted a lawyer to run the governments of the islands.&quot;

As Secretary of War, Root actively framed the establishment of civilian governments in the new American territories of Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. He also modernized the Department of War. His rapid success and popularity led Root to become the first choice of the Republican National Committee for the vice presidential nomination in 1900 by December 1899, but McKinley had objected to losing his Secretary of War, and Root himself preferred to stay in the Cabinet. The nomination ultimately went to Theodore Roosevelt over his own objection and led to his ascension as President upon the assassination of McKinley in 1901.

During the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, Root handled foreign policy matters for Secretary of State John Hay, who was ill.

Root resigned from the cabinet on February 1, 1904, and returned to private practice as a lawyer. He was succeeded by William Howard Taft.

===Military reforms===

At Root&#x27;s appointment, the Department of War had a public reputation for inefficiency, corruption, and scandals which had characterized Alger&#x27;s tenure and the war. His immediate focus was reforming military administration, which he viewed as a prerequisite for success in territorial administration or any future military campaign. Though the United States had just completed a successful, brief military campaign against Spain, its officer corps was still organized on peacetime terms; Root set about permanently placing the United States military on a war footing. Root worked closely with Adjutant General Henry Clark Corbin and William Harding Carter.

His chief obstacle was Commanding General of the Army Nelson A. Miles; the offices of Commanding General and Secretary of War had long been engaged in a power struggle, and Root&#x27;s reforms would directly implicate Miles&#x27;s authority. Root proposed the establishment of a General Staff led by the office of Chief of Staff of the United States Army. The Chief of Staff was to be a general officer of the Army answerable directly to the Secretary of War and the President. The Chief of Staff would carry out the Secretary&#x27;s instructions and supervise discipline and maneuvers. The reorganization was accomplished by an act of Congress passed on February 14, 1903. Root also changed the procedures for promotions and also devised the principle of rotating officers from staff to line. Working with Secretary of the Navy William Henry Moody, Root established closer coordination between the Army and Navy, including the establishment of a joint board under General Orders No. 107.

Root also sought to enhance military training. To that end, he enlarged the United States Military Academy and established the U.S. Army War College and additional training posts, especially Fort Leavenworth. He likewise provided for additional National Guard officer training programs at Fort Leavenworth for those volunteer officers who had shown capacity during the Spanish–American War; per Root&#x27;s instructions, the National Guard would also be equipped with the same arms as the regular army and examinations would be administered to qualify members for higher command.

===Territorial administration===
As a result of the Spanish–American War, the United States held military control of Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. As Secretary of War, Root was tasked with the administration of martial law on the islands and the eventual transition to civilian government. Under the terms of the Teller Amendment, the United States was additionally bound to return &quot;control of [Cuba] to its people.&quot; Particularly in the Philippines, the United States also faced militant insurgency from natives who resisted their transfer from one foreign empire to another.

He worked out the procedures for turning Cuba over to the Cubans, ensured a charter of government for the Philippines, and eliminated tariffs on goods imported to the United States from Puerto Rico. When the Anti-Imperialist League attacked American policies in the Philippines, Root defended the policies and counterattacked the critics, saying they prolonged the insurgency.

For this work, he relied on legal advisor Charles Edward Magoon. Magoon had been hired at the Bureau of Insular Affairs by Root&#x27;s predecessor, Russell Alger, and drafted an internal report taking the official position that residents of Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and other territories became subject to all the rights granted by the Constitution. After Root&#x27;s appointment, Magoon controversially revised the department&#x27;s legal position to require an Act of Congress, as had been passed in the cases of the Northwest Territory and Louisiana Purchase, to regulate the rights of territorial subjects. This revised position was upheld by the Supreme Court in a series of landmark decisions collectively known as the Insular Cases.

In Cuba, the American challenge was to arrange for the transition to civilian government while preserving order and guaranteeing protection against international predation. Root established the island&#x27;s first republican form of government under the command of Leonard Wood. This was accomplished by the Cuban constitution of 1901, and the American military government withdrew in 1902.

====Philippine-American War====

Root&#x27;s primary administrative challenge as Secretary of War was the effort to establish control of the Philippine Islands. Though American government of the islands was internationally recognized under the Treaty of Paris, the native independence movement resisted imperial control. Relative to Cuba and Puerto Rico, the islands&#x27; distance and the relative underdevelopment of Spanish institutions made administration far more challenging.

Root&#x27;s primary goal was the establishment of a civilian governor-general (as had been applied in Cuba) rather than a military governor; however, he felt that education of the native population was necessary before such a transition could be successful. In 1900, Root guided the establishment of the Philippine commission, led by William Howard Taft, as a move toward autonomous civil government. The first step in his proposed process was the establishment of municipal governments and administrative divisions. The commission was to be guided by the principles of the Virginia Declaration of Rights.

===Alaskan boundary dispute===
In addition to his duties as Secretary of War, Root was one of three Americans appointed by President Roosevelt (with Henry Cabot Lodge and George Turner) to an international arbitration court to resolve the boundary dispute between Alaska and Great Britain. The dispute arose as a result of the Klondike Gold Rush of 1900, which heightened interest in the region and tensions over the exact boundary between the regions.

On October 20, 1903, the dispute was resolved by British jurist Richard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone in favor of the United States on every point of contention.

==Secretary of State (1905–1909)==

Root&#x27;s retirement from public office was brief, but he remained active in public life, delivering speeches in defense of Roosevelt&#x27;s policies in Panama and in the Northern Securities case. After Mark Hanna died in February 1904, shortly after Root&#x27;s resignation, Root declined to succeed him as chair of the Republican National Committee. He also repeatedly refused efforts to draft him as the Republican candidate for Governor in the 1904 election; instead, he focused on securing Roosevelt&#x27;s nomination to a full term at the national convention, where he delivered the opening speech.

After the death of John Hay, President Roosevelt named Root as United States Secretary of State and he returned to the cabinet on July 7, 1905. As secretary, Root placed the consular service under the civil service. He maintained the Open Door Policy in the Far East.

On a tour of Latin America in 1906, Root persuaded those governments to participate in the Hague Peace Conference. He worked with Japan to limit emigration to the United States and on dealings with China. He established the Root–Takahira Agreement. He worked with Great Britain in arbitration of issues between the United States and Canada on the Alaska boundary dispute, and competition in the North Atlantic fisheries. He supported arbitration in resolving international disputes.

==United States Senator (1909–1915)==
=== Overview ===
In January 1909, Root was elected by the legislature as a U.S. Senator from New York, serving from March 4, 1909, to March 3, 1915. He was a member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. He chose not to seek re-election in 1914.

During and after his Senate service, Root served as president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, from 1910 to 1925.

In 1912, as a result of his work to bring nations together through arbitration and cooperation, Root received the Nobel Peace Prize.

=== Notable Policy Positions ===
In a 1910 letter published by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Root supported the proposed income tax amendment, which was ratified as the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution:
It is said that a very large part of any income tax under the amendment would be paid by citizens of New York...

The reason why the citizens of New York will pay so large a part of the tax in New York City is the chief financial and commercial center of a great country with vast resources and industrial activity. For many years Americans engaged in developing the wealth of all parts of the country have been going to New York to secure capital and market their securities and to buy their supplies. Thousands of men who have amassed fortunes in all sorts of enterprises in other states have gone to New York to live because they like the life of the city or because their distant enterprises require representation at the financial center. The incomes of New York are in a great measure derived from the country at large. A continual stream of wealth sets toward the great city from the mines and manufactories and railroads outside of New York.
=== Election of 1912 and Judicial Authority ===
During the 1912 presidential election, Root was placed in a difficult position regarding his two friends and political partners: William Howard Taft and Theodore Roosevelt. Beginning in 1910, Roosevelt had begun challenging the absolute authority of judicial review, arguing that the Supreme Court was using its power to strike down necessary reform legislation, as best represented in decisions like &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot; (1905). Taft, a lawyer and former judge (and future Supreme Court Chief Justice), was appalled, believing Roosevelt would be a danger to the nation&#x27;s constitutional order if re-elected. Root, himself a lawyer and constitutional conservative, agreed with some of Roosevelts criticisms on a personal level, but thought that attacking the court&#x27;s authority in such an open way was extremely dangerous. He himself thought judicial review was &quot;the most valuable contribution of America to political science.&quot; While he would not attack his former boss in public, he played a key role in the 1912 Republican National Convention as convention chairman. There, he formally counted the delegates that gave the nomination to Taft and offered a speech that aligned the Republican Party with a defense of the Supreme Court&#x27;s authority. Though Roosevelt would still run as the Progressive &quot;Bull Moose&quot; Party nominee, the split in the Republican Party ensured his defeat. Thereafter, Root and Taft would play an important role in identifying the Republican Party with constitutional conservatism.

==World War I==
At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Root opposed neutrality. Root promoted the Preparedness Movement to get the United States ready for actual participation in the war. He was a leading advocate of American entry into the war on the side of the British and French because he feared the militarism of Germany would be bad for the world and for the United States.

In June 1916, he scotched talk that he might contend for the Republican presidential nomination, stating that he was too old to bear the burden of the Presidency. At the Republican National Convention, Root reached his peak strength of 103 votes on the first ballot. The Republican presidential nomination went to Charles Evans Hughes, who lost the election to the Democrat Woodrow Wilson.

===Root Commission===
In June 1917, at age 72, Root headed a mission to Russia sent by President Wilson to arrange American co-operation with the Russian Provisional Government headed by Alexander Kerensky. Root remained in Petrograd for close to a month and was not much impressed by what he saw. American financial aid to the new regime was possible only if the Russians would fight on the Allied side. The Russians, he said, &quot;are sincere, kindly, good people but confused and dazed&quot;. He summed up the Provisional Government trenchantly: &quot;No fight, no loans.&quot; This provoked the Provisional Government to initiate failed offensives against Austrian forces in July 1917. The resulting steep decline in popularity of the Provisional Government opened the door for the Bolshevik party and the October Revolution.

Root was the founding chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, established in 1918 in New York.

==Later career==
In the Senate fight in 1919 over American membership in the League of Nations, Root supported Henry Cabot Lodge&#x27;s proposal of membership with certain reservations that allowed the United States government to decide whether or not it would go to war. The United States never joined, but Root supported the League of Nations and served on the commission of jurists which created the Permanent Court of International Justice. In 1922, when Root was 77, President Warren G. Harding appointed him as a delegate to the Washington Naval Conference as part of an American team headed by Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes. Root was a presidential elector for Calvin Coolidge in the 1924 presidential election.

Root also worked with Andrew Carnegie in programs for international peace and the advancement of science, becoming the first president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Root was also among the founders of the American Law Institute in 1923 and helped create The Hague Academy of International Law in the Netherlands. Root served as vice president of the American Peace Society, which publishes &quot;World Affairs&quot;, the oldest U.S. journal on international relations.

==Views==
===Opposition to women&#x27;s suffrage===
Root was a prominent opponent of women&#x27;s suffrage. As chairman of the judiciary committee of a New York State constitutional convention in 1894, Root spoke against women&#x27;s right to vote, and he worked to ensure that the right was not included in the state constitution. He would remain an active opponent of feminism for the rest of his career.

==Personal life==
===Family===
In 1870, Root accompanied his brother Wally, with whom he had lived in his early days in New York, on a European voyage. Wally suffered from tuberculosis (then known as incurable &quot;consumption&quot;) and believed that the trip would cure his disease. The brothers were together in Dresden at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War; they followed its progress throughout the summer as Wally&#x27;s condition worsened. Towards the end of the trip, Elihu had to carry his brother in his arms. They returned to Clinton, where Wally died on November 15, 1870. Elihu paid off his debts.

In 1878, Root married Clara Frances Wales, the daughter of prominent New York Republican Salem Howe Wales. They had three children: 
* Edith Root (b. December 1, 1878, m. Ulysses S. Grant III)
* Elihu Root Jr. (b. May 7, 1881, m. Alida Stryker)
* Edward Wales Root (b. July 23, 1884)

Elihu Root Jr. graduated from Hamilton College and became an attorney, like his father. He married Alida Stryker, the daughter of Hamilton College president M. Woolsey Stryker.

===Religion===
Root was a devout Presbyterian, consistent with his upbringing. Upon first moving to New York City, he enrolled as a member of the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association, served as its vice president, contributed essays on Christian manhood to its literary society, and taught Sunday school.

===Friendships and professional associations===
Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals Willard Bartlett was Root&#x27;s lifelong friend from their time as young lawyers in New York.

Root shared a love of western big game hunting with President Roosevelt.

Root was a member of the Union League Club of New York and twice served as its president, 1898–99, and again from 1915 to 1916. He also served as president of the New York City Bar Association from 1904 to 1905. He became the president of the National Security League in 1917, succeeding his mentor Joseph Hodges Choate. Root spoke in favor of war and in opposition to women&#x27;s suffrage as head of the league. He was a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Death and legacy==

Root died in 1937 in New York City, with his family by his side. A simple service was held in Clinton, led by Episcopal bishop E.H. Coley of the Episcopal Diocese of Central New York. Root is buried, along with his wife Clara (d. 1928), at the Hamilton College Cemetery.

Root was the last surviving member of the McKinley Cabinet and the last Cabinet member to have served in the 19th century.

===Legacy===
Professor Alfred McCoy argues that Root was the first &quot;foreign policy grandmaster&quot; in American history and that Root more than any other figure is responsible for transforming America into a world power. According to McCoy, Root devoted his time as Secretary of State and as a Senator to ensuring that the United States would have a consistent presence in world affairs, and Root helped to establish the Special Relationship between the United States and Great Britain. Root helped to ensure that powerful business interests and the intellectual elite supported an interventionist foreign policy.

In addition to receiving the Nobel Prize, Root was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown (from Belgium) and the Grand Commander of the Order of George I (from Greece).Root joined the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution in 1895, based on his descent from Lieutenant Elihu Root (1772–1843) who was an officer in the Continental Army from Massachusetts, and was the second cousin twice removed of the publisher Henry Luce. In 1912, Root was elected as an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati.

===Memorials===
During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in his honor.

Root&#x27;s home in Clinton, which he purchased in 1893, became known as the Elihu Root House, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972. The United States Army Reserve Base in New York Mills, New York, bears his name.

The Elihu Root Gold Medal is awarded to the six highest scoring civilian competitors in the National Trophy Rifle Team Match and are subsequently named as team members. The captain and coach of the highest-scoring civilian team are named as the coach and captain of the team. All eight members receive Elihu Root gold medals.

<doc id="287469" wikidata="Q1284174" url="?curid=287469" title="Panama City–Bay County International Airport">
<text>Panama City–Bay County International Airport was a public airport northwest of Panama City, in Bay County, Florida. It was owned and operated by the Panama City–Bay County Airport and Industrial District. All airline services moved to the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport on May 22, 2010, but the airfield was open to general aviation aircraft until October 1, 2010. The grounds will eventually be turned over to LUK-MB1 LLC, which plans to remove the runways and build homes, shops, walking trails and a marina.

== History ==
Panama City–Bay County International Airport (PFN) began as a private field owned by J.B. Atkinson, Jr., a citizen of Panama City. The facility had 292 acres (1.2 km2) of land with grass landing strips. In 1932 Atkinson and his wife donated the property to the Panama City Chamber of Commerce so a city airport could be established. At that time the airport was named Atkinson Field. In 1938 Panama City and the Bay County Commissioners joined forces to develop the airport through the construction of an airport terminal and extensive airfield expansion. The facility&#x27;s $604,000 development project included the construction of a small passenger terminal and two intersecting runways. After the expansion was completed, the airport was renamed Fannin Field in honor of Panama City&#x27;s then-mayor, Harry G. Fannin.

Through World War II the airport was a Civil Air Patrol facility, the location of Coastal Patrol Base 14. In 1943 the Florida legislature approved the formation of an airport authority, the Panama City–Bay County Airport and Industrial District, to manage Fannin Field, or Panama City–Bay County Airport, as it became known. In 1948 commercial scheduled passenger airline operations began.

In 1992 the airport was equipped with on-call customs and immigrations facilities provided through the Port of Panama City and was designated as an international airport and renamed Panama City–Bay County International Airport. The airport was declared a Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ), allowing special customs procedures. These permit domestic activity involving foreign items to take place as though they were outside of U.S. Customs territory.

In 1995 the airport went through extensive development, demolishing the old terminal building and building a new facility with six gates, two with jetbridges. The terminal had concession areas, a passenger hold room, ticketing counters and airline office space, airport administration offices, public and rental car parking lots, and a larger apron. Service included Delta Connection to Atlanta, US Airways Express to Charlotte (and other destinations initially in Florida) and Northwest Airlink to Memphis.

However, by the late 1990s, it was obvious that the airport was nearing the end of its useful life. The runways were very short by modern standards, but could not be expanded without either extending them into nearby St. Andrews Bay or residential neighborhoods. It was eventually decided to build a new airport in Panama City Beach, which eventually became Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport. The new airport opened May 23, 2010 with flights operated by Delta Air Lines with a mainline jetliner service to Atlanta as well as new service operated by Southwest Airlines with Boeing 737 jetliners.

==Past airline service==

From the 1950s until the late 1970s, two airlines served Panama City: National Airlines and Southern Airways. In the early 1950s National Lockheed Lodestars flew to Jacksonville and New Orleans via various stops. Southern began service in the mid 1950s with Douglas DC-3s to Atlanta via several stops. In 1967 National Lockheed L-188 Electra propjets flew direct to Miami, New Orleans, Orlando, Jacksonville, Mobile and Key West and nonstop to Pensacola and Tallahassee. The first jets were Southern Douglas DC-9-10s in 1967. In 1968, Southern DC-9s flew direct to Atlanta via Dothan, AL, and their Martin 4-0-4s flew nonstop to Atlanta, Dothan and Fort Walton Beach (via Eglin AFB), and direct to Birmingham, Montgomery and New Orleans. In 1969 National Boeing 727-100s flew direct to Miami, Tampa, New Orleans, Houston, Mobile, Jacksonville and Melbourne, FL and nonstop to Pensacola and Tallahassee.

By the spring of 1975 all National and Southern flights to Panama City were operated with mainline jets (National with Boeing 727-100 and 727-200s with Southern operating Douglas DC-9-10s) with a combined total of fourteen jet flights arriving every weekday into the airport. In 1976 National Boeing 727-200s flew direct to Panama City from New York JFK Airport, Washington D.C. National Airport (now Reagan Airport), Las Vegas, San Francisco, Houston, New Orleans, Miami, Charleston, Norfolk, Jacksonville and Mobile as well as nonstop from Tampa, Tallahassee and Pensacola. Southern Douglas DC-9-10s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s flew nonstop from Atlanta, Dothan, Eglin AFB and Tallahassee and direct from Miami and Orlando. In 1977 South Central Air Transport (SCAT), a commuter airline, was flying to New Orleans, Montgomery, Mobile and Fort Walton Beach (via Eglin AFB) with Handley Page Jetstream propjets.

National Airlines was no longer serving Panama City by 1979. Southern Airways had merged with North Central Airlines to form Republic Airlines which flew nonstop DC-9-10, DC-9-30 and DC-9-50 jets to Atlanta, Orlando and Tallahassee and direct to Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport, Memphis, Huntsville and Miami. Also in 1979, Air Florida, a new start-up airline, was serving Panama City as well with Boeing 737-200 and Douglas DC-9-10 jets nonstop to Pensacola and Tallahassee and direct to Tampa and Miami.

Metro Airlines (operating code sharing flights as Eastern Metro Express on behalf of Eastern Airlines) was flying BAe Jetstream 31 and de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 turboprops nonstop between Panama City and Atlanta beginning in the mid 1980s.

In 1986 Republic Airlines was acquired by and merged into Northwest Airlines which in 1987 flew Douglas DC-9-10s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s nonstop between Panama City and its hub in Memphis.

Air New Orleans (operating code sharing service as Continental Express on behalf of Continental Airlines) was flying small Beechcraft C99 commuter turboprops nonstop to Orlando and Tampa and direct to New Orleans in 1987. Air New Orleans was initially based in Panama City.

By 1991 Delta Air Lines McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s flew nonstop to Atlanta. Previously in 1989, Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA) de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 and Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia propjets flew nonstop to Atlanta operating as the Delta Connection on a code sharing basis on behalf of Delta and these flights then continued in tandem with Delta&#x27;s mainline jet service.

In 1994 Delta Air Lines Boeing 737-200s and McDonnell Douglas MD-80s flew nonstop to Atlanta and direct to Dallas/Fort Worth, Louisville and Norfolk with Delta operating the only mainline jet service into Panama City at the time. Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA) was continuing to fly nonstop from Atlanta with Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprops. Northwest Airlink was flying nonstop from Memphis with Saab 340 turboprops on a code sharing basis on behalf of Northwest Airlines. US Airways Express Beechcraft 1900C commuter turboprops were serving the airport on behalf of US Airways with code sharing flights nonstop from Orlando, Tampa and Fort Walton Beach.

In 2007 Delta Connection Canadair CRJ-200, CRJ-700 and Embraer ERJ-145 regional jets as well as ATR 72 turboprops were flying nonstop to Atlanta. Delta Connection Embraer ERJ-145s also flew nonstop to Orlando while their Canadair CRJs flew nonstop to Cincinnati on Saturdays only with Northwest Airlink Canadair CRJ regional jets flying nonstop to Memphis.

Other commuter airlines serving the airport over the years including Dolphin Airlines, Mackey International Airlines, Scheduled Skyways and Sun Air.

<text>Palm Beach International Airport – also known as PBI Airport and historically as Morrison Field &amp; Palm Beach Air Force Base – is a public airport in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States located just west of the city of West Palm Beach, for which it serves as the primary airport. It is also the primary airport for most of Palm Beach County, serving the suburbs and cities of Boca Raton, Wellington, Boynton Beach, Jupiter, and Palm Beach Gardens. It is the third busiest airport in the Miami metropolitan area after Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport.

Palm Beach Airport is operated by the Palm Beach County Department of Airports. Road access to the airport is direct from I-95, Southern Boulevard, and Congress Avenue. The airport is bordered on the west by Military Trail.

==History==
Palm Beach International Airport began operations in 1936 as Morrison Field. It was named in honor of Grace Morrison, a key participant in the planning and organization of the airfield. The first flight departing the field was a New York-bound DC-2 operated by Eastern Air Lines in 1936. The airport was officially dedicated on December 19, 1936.

In 1937, the airport expanded beyond an airstrip and an administration building when the Palm Beach Aero Corporation obtained a lease, built hangars and the first terminal on the south side of the airport. The new terminal was known as the Eastern Air Lines Terminal.

The field was used by the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Morrison Field was used for training and later as a staging base for the Allied invasion of France, with numerous aircraft departing Morrison en route to the United Kingdom to take part in the D-Day invasion of Normandy. Morrison Field was a stopover for flights to and from India, via Brazil and West Africa.

In 1947, the newly established U.S. Air Force returned ownership of Morrison Field to Palm Beach County. The name was then changed to Palm Beach International Airport one year later, in 1948.

The airport was again used by the U.S. Air Force in 1951 and renamed Palm Beach Air Force Base under the control of the Military Air Transport Service (MATS). USAF operations occupied the north half of the airfield while civil operations and the airline terminal used the south half. MATS used the base for training with the host unit being the 1707th Air Transport Wing (Heavy), and its 1740th Heavy Transport Training Unit. The 1707 ATW was known as the &quot;University of MATS&quot;, becoming the primary USAF training unit for all Air Force personnel supporting and flying heavy transport aircraft. These included C-124 Globemaster II, C-118 Liftmaster, C-97 Stratofreighter, and C-54 Skymaster maintenance training along with aircrew and transition pilot training. Nearly 23,000 airmen trained at Palm Beach AFB during the Korean War.

The Air Weather Service used Palm Beach AFB as headquarters for hurricane research, flying the first WB-50D Superfortress &quot;Hurricane Hunter&quot; aircraft from the base in 1956.

After several years of Palm Beach County fighting the Air Force presence in West Palm Beach, the Air Force started to close down operations there. The 1707 ATW was inactivated on June 30, 1959, and reassigned to Tinker AFB, Oklahoma. With the wing&#x27;s departure, Palm Beach County took over airfield operations. The Air Force retained a small presence at the base with the 9th Weather Group becoming the main operational unit at Palm Beach AFB, performing hurricane and weather research for the Air Weather Service. The Air Photographic and Charting Service (APCS) moved its 1370th Photo-Mapping Wing to the base, performing geodetic survey flights. The Air Force finally closed Palm Beach AFB in 1962, and all property was conveyed to Palm Beach International Airport the same year.

Delta Air Lines began scheduled flights in 1959 and Capital Airlines in 1960. The first turbine-powered flights were Eastern Airlines Lockheed L-188 Electras in 1959, and Eastern DC-8 nonstops to Idlewild started in December 1960.

Air Force One was a frequent visitor to PBI during John F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidency in the early 1960s. Local voters defeated a proposal to relocate the airport around this time, instead choosing to expand the existing facilities. In October 1966, an eight-gate Main Terminal opened on the northeast side of the airport; in 1974 Delta Air Lines moved into its own six-gate terminal with the airport&#x27;s first jetways. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) built a new Air Traffic Control Tower on the south side of the airport during this period.

By the mid-1970s, the airport&#x27;s dominant carriers were Delta, Eastern and National. Eastern operated the airport&#x27;s only widebody service at the time, daily L-1011s to New York JFK and Newark. By 1979, National operated daily DC-10 service to JFK, LaGuardia and Miami, while Eastern operated L-1011s to Atlanta and Delta operated L-1011s to Tampa. By 1985, eight widebodies a day flew between PBI and the three New York airports.

The 25-gate David McCampbell Terminal, named for a World War II naval flying ace, was dedicated in 1988. In 2003, the terminal was voted among the finest in the nation by readers of Conde Nast Traveler Magazine. In that year, a new landscaped I-95 interchange was built to decrease traffic on Southern Boulevard (US 98) extending Turnage Boulevard (the road around the perimeter of the concourse).

Competition from rapidly expanding Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport cut growth at the airport in the 1990s. The 2001 recession and the September 11 terrorist attacks further inhibited growth, but development in South Florida since 2002 has finally led to a surge of passenger traffic at the airport. In addition, discount carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest Airlines began service to PBI. In 2006, the county embarked on an interim expansion program by breaking ground on a 7-story parking garage and the addition of 3 gates in Concourse C. Long range expansions include gates at Concourse B and the eventual construction of a new 14 gate Concourse D to be extended east from the present terminal.

Following the 2016 election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, Air Force One again became a frequent visitor to PBI, typically parking on the south side of the airport near Southern Boulevard while Trump visited his nearby Mar-a-Lago estate. Until 2017, a line of school buses was used as a temporary barrier between the aircraft and onlookers. Palm Beach County stated that it would erect a more permanent barrier system in mid-2017, but the school buses were still in use as of that November.

In 2024, PBI was ranked by Travel+Leisure as the third-best domestic airport in the US by its readers. Criteria was based on access, check-in, restaurants, shopping, and design, and was ranked from excellent to poor in those categories. Only Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and Rhode Island T. F. Green International Airport kept PBI Airport out of the top spot.

==Facilities==
=== Runways and taxiways ===
Palm Beach International Airport covers and has three runways:
*10L/28R: 10,001 x 150 ft. (3,048 x 46 m), asphalt
*10R/28L: 3,214 x 75 ft. (980 x 23 m), asphalt
*14/32: 6,931 x 150 ft. (2,113 x 46 m), asphalt

The airport&#x27;s runway designations were changed by the Federal Aviation Administration to their current configuration on December 17, 2009. Previously, they had been 09L/27R, 09R/27L, and 13/31.

=== Terminal ===

Palm Beach International Airport has one terminal, which as of 2024 consists of 32 gates (28 jetway gates, 4 hardstands) and three concourses.

*Concourse A contains 4 gates (Gates A1-A4). It is a ground-level concourse with hardstand gates for smaller regional aircraft. Bahamasair is the only airline currently operating in Concourse A.
*Concourse B contains 13 gates (Gates B1-B12, B14). It serves Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Avelo Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, and United Airlines.
*Concourse C contains 15 gates (Gates C1-C12, C14-C16). It serves Air Canada, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Porter Airlines, and Spirit Airlines.

Customs and Immigration services for international flights are located on the lower level on the west side of the terminal and can be accessed by a gates on both Concourses A and B. A future Concourse D is proposed, to be constructed off the east side of the terminal.

===Control tower===
A Airport Traffic Control tower is active on the north side of the airport – west of concourse A, off Belvedere Road – along with a single-story, ATBM Base Building. The current tower replaced the previous one, which was located on the southern side of the airport. The old tower was eventually demolished after the new tower came into service.

===Helicopters===
*Helicopter operations typically use 10R/28L or its parallel taxiways or make a direct approach to either Customs or the Galaxy Aviation ramp.
*Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office (PBSO) maintains its air division from a hangar at the southwest corner of the airport.
*Health Care District of Palm Beach County operates the Traumahawk with Palm Beach County Fire-Rescue from a hangar at the southwest corner of the airport, next to PBSO.

===Other hangars===
*General Aviation fixed-base operators (FBO) and hangars are located along the southern edge of the airport, with entrance access available by the Jet Aviation FBO. Other FBOs at PBI include Atlantic Aviation and Signature Flight Support.

===Fire protection and emergency medical services===

The Palm Beach County Fire Rescue Aviation Battalion is located between the runways at PBI. The fire station, which is located near the center of the airport grounds, is home to 13 pieces of specialized fire fighting equipment.

These apparatus include:
*An air stair which allows for assistance in deplaning in an emergency
*Five airport crash tenders that go by the call sign &quot;Dragon&quot; (Dragon 1, Dragon 2, etc.)
*A foam unit that carries Purple-K concentrate to assist with extinguishing a fire
*A heavy rescue vehicle that carries additional tools for plane crashes and other mass-casualty incidents

===Trauma Hawk===

The Trauma Hawk Station, which is located at the south west corner of the airport, Palm Beach County Fire Rescue has two Sikorsky S-76C helos. The department partners with the Palm Beach County Health Care District to operate the Trauma Hawk Aero-Medical Program. The Trauma Hawk program, which was established in November 1990, replaced the use of Palm Beach County Sheriff&#x27;s Office helicopters to medevac critically injured patients to area hospitals. Air ambulances are identically equipped and can carry two patients each and up to four medical attendants if needed. Each helicopter is staffed with a pilot, a registered nurse (RN) and a paramedic. The nurses and paramedics are Palm Beach County Fire Rescue employees while the pilots are Health Care District employees.

==Ground transportation==

=== Car ===
Interstate 95, Southern Boulevard, and Congress Avenue all serve – and provide direct vehicular access to – the airport.

=== Public transportation ===

==== Bus ====
Palm Tran bus routes 40 and 44 serve the airport. Both provide connections to the Amtrak/Tri-Rail West Palm Beach train station; the station is also served by Greyhound buses.

==== Rail ====
Palm Beach International Airport is near the West Palm Beach Brightline Station (served by Brightline) and the West Palm Beach Amtrak/Tri-Rail station (served by Amtrak intercity trains and Tri-Rail commuter trains). A Palm Tran shuttle bus service connects the latter station with the airport.

==Controversies==
In conjunction with the slated construction of a new ATC tower at PBIA, the Federal Aviation Administration intended to transfer all of PBIA&#x27;s air traffic controllers whose assigned sector is between 5 and from the airport to a remote facility at Miami International Airport. Ground traffic controllers, and approach controllers whose sector is within of the runway would have remained at PBIA. The FAA cited the move as a cost-cutting measure, but critics say that it creates a risk to South Florida air traffic if the Miami facility is damaged in a hurricane or a terrorist attack. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association opposed the move. The remote facility at Miami International Airport houses air traffic controllers for Miami and Fort Lauderdale international airports.

Donald Trump sued to block the expansion of one of the runways at PBIA in 2010. In 2015, he initiated a $100 million lawsuit over the flight path that passes over his Mar-a-Lago estate. He dropped the lawsuit in 2016 after his presidential victory ensured some type of no fly zone over his property.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On August 21, 1956, a USAF Douglas C-124C Globemaster II crashed during its initial climb at then Palm Beach Air Force Base when a prop cuff came off an engine and went through the fuselage, cutting control cables, the aircraft banked to the right and crashed into a tree nursery, three out of the six occupants were killed.
*On January 30, 2008, American Airlines Flight 1738, a Boeing 757 flying from Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Philadelphia International Airport, had to make an emergency landing in West Palm Beach after the captain reported smoke in the cockpit. Of the 137 passengers and seven crewmembers, one passenger and five crewmembers were taken to the hospital, including the captain and the first officer.
*On November 11, 2010, a Piper PA-44 Seminole flying from Palm Beach International Airport to Melbourne Orlando International Airport crashed on a taxiway after an engine failed during takeoff. The plane was operated by Florida Institute of Technology&#x27;s College of Aeronautics and all four aboard—two FIT flight students, a flight instructor, and a passenger—were killed.
*On October 25, 2012, Spirit Airlines Flight 946, an Airbus A319 flying from Rafael Núñez International Airport in Cartagena, Colombia, to Fort Lauderdale International Airport, had made an emergency landing after engine No. 2 had failed on the aircraft. The plane had landed safely, and there was no damage to the plane or injuries reported.
*On March 24, 2014, Delta Airlines Flight 2014, a McDonnell Douglas MD-90 flying from Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport to Palm Beach International Airport, had declared an emergency due to a hydraulic problem and made an emergency landing on runway 28R. There was no damage to the plane and there were no injuries.
*On July 21, 2016, American Airlines Flight 1822, an Airbus A319 flying from Palm Beach International Airport to Philadelphia International Airport experienced a hydraulic fluid leak while taxiing for departure. Passengers exited the aircraft via emergency slides. Seventeen people were treated for various injuries.
*On May 10, 2022, a Cessna 208 Caravan with two passengers aboard en route from Marsh Harbour Airport in the Bahamas to Treasure Coast International Airport in Fort Pierce, Florida, made an emergency landing at Palm Beach International Airport. After the pilot fell ill and lost consciousness, passenger Darren Harrison took control and called the tower at Treasure Coast International. Robert Morgan, an air traffic controller and a certified flight instructor, guided Harrison, who had no flying experience, to land safely at Palm Beach. The pilot who collapsed was hospitalized and his condition later stabilized. Neither passenger was injured.
*On January 24, 2023, an alleged bomb threat aboard a Frontier Airlines flight prompted authorities to evacuate Concourse C of the airport. A passenger made a statement that there was a bomb in his bags. The passenger who made the threat was arrested by the FBI.

<doc id="287473" wikidata="Q8009382" url="?curid=287473" title="Soyombo script">
<text>The Soyombo script () is an abugida developed by the monk and scholar Zanabazar in 1686 to write Mongolian. It can also be used to write Tibetan and Sanskrit.

A special character of the script, the Soyombo symbol, became a national symbol of Mongolia and has appeared on the national flag and emblem of Mongolia since 1911, as well as in money and postage stamps.

== Creation ==
The script was designed in 1686 by Zanabazar, the first spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia, who also designed the Horizontal square script. The Soyombo script was created as the fourth Mongolian script, only 38 years after the invention of the Clear script. The name of the script alludes to this story. It is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;svayambhu&quot; .

The syllabic system in fact appears to be based on Devanagari, while the base shape of the letters is derived from the Ranjana alphabet. Details of individual characters resemble traditional Mongolian alphabets and the Old Turkic alphabet.

== Use ==

The eastern Mongols used the script primarily as a ceremonial and decorative script. Zanabazar had created it for the translation of Buddhist texts from Sanskrit or Tibetan, and both he and his students used it extensively for that purpose.

As it was much too complicated to be adopted as an everyday script, its use is practically nonexistent today. Aside from historical texts, it can usually be found in temple inscriptions. It also has some relevance to linguistic research, because it reflects certain developments in the Mongolian language, such as that of long vowels.

== Form ==


The Soyombo script was the first Mongolian script to be written horizontally from left to right, in contrast to earlier scripts that had been written vertically. As in the Tibetan and Devanagari scripts, the signs are suspended below a horizontal line, giving each line of text a visible &quot;backbone&quot;.

The two variations of the &quot;Soyombo&quot; symbol are used as special characters to mark the start and end of a text. Two of its elements (the upper triangle and the right vertical bar) form the angular base frame for the other characters.

Within this frame, the syllables are composed of one to three elements. The first consonant is placed high within the angle.
The vowel is given by a mark above the frame, except for u and ü which are marked in the low center.
A second consonant is specified by a small mark, appended to the inside of the vertical bar, pushing any u or ü mark to the left side.
A short oblique hook at the bottom of the vertical bar marks a long vowel.
There is also a curved or jagged mark to the right of the vertical bar for the two diphthongs.

===Syllable structure===

====Mongolian====
A syllable in Mongolian must contain a consonant or the null-consonant , and may contain any of a vowel marker, a vowel length marker, a diphthong marker, and a final consonant.

====Tibetan====
A syllable in Tibetan must contain a consonant or the null-consonant , and may contain any of a prefixed consonant, medial consonants, a vowel marker, a vowel length marker, and a syllable-ending &quot;tsheg&quot;.

====Sanskrit====
A syllable in Sanskrit must contain a consonant or the null-consonant , and may contain any of prefixed consonant, medial consonants, a vowel marker, a vowel length marker, a diphthong marker, and one of the diacritics, &quot;anusvara&quot; or &quot;visarga&quot;.

== Alphabet ==

===Consonants===
Soyombo contains the full set of letters to reproduce Mongolian as well as additional letters () used in transcribing Sanskrit and Tibetan. Some letters represent different sounds in Mongolian, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. The primary difference between the three occurs in Mongolian, where letters for Sanskrit voiceless sounds are used for voiced stops, while the letters for voiceless aspirated sounds are used for voiceless stops. 

====Mongolian====

Mongolian employs a subset of Soyombo consonants, with Mongolian-specific pronunciations. 
In Mongolian, a final consonant is written with a simplified variant of the basic letter in the bottom of the frame. In cases where it would conflict with the vowels u or ü the vowel is written to the left.

====Sanskrit and Tibetan====
In Sanskrit and Tibetan, consonant clusters are usually written by stacking up to three consonants vertically within the same frame. 

In consonant clusters beginning with &quot;ra&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;śa&quot; or &quot;sa&quot;, the first consonant can be reduced to a small prefix written to the left of the next letter&#x27;s main triangle. For example, the syllable &quot;rka&quot; can also be written .

===Vowels===
As in other Brahmic scripts, a consonant in the Soyombo script carries an inherent vowel, &quot;a&quot;, so, for example, the letter is pronounced &quot;ka&quot;. Syllables with other vowel sounds are constructed by adding a vowel mark to the base character. So, for example, the syllable &quot;ki&quot; is formed by adding the diacritic to a . The first character of the alphabet acts as a null consonant or vowel carrier, allowing formation of syllables beginning with a vowel sound. On its own, it represents a short &quot;a&quot;. Syllables starting with other vowels are constructed by adding a vowel mark to . 

Mongolian uses seven vowels, all of which have a short and a long form. The long form is indicated with the length mark. 
Diphthongs are represented by adding one of the diphthong markers to a syllable.
Sanskrit also includes the syllabic consonants ṛ and ḷ, which are treated as vowels and may be short or long. Sanskrit transcription also requires two additional diacritics, the &quot;anusvara&quot; , which indicates that a vowel is nasalised, and the &quot;visarga&quot; , which indicates post-vocalic aspiration.

==Punctuation==

Apart from the Soyombo symbol, the only punctuation mark is a full stop, represented by a vertical bar. In inscriptions, words are often separated by a dot at the height of the upper triangle (&quot;tsheg&quot;).

== Unicode ==
Soyombo script has been included in the Unicode Standard since the release of Unicode version 10.0 in June 2017. The Soyombo block currently comprises 83 characters. The proposal to encode Soyombo was submitted by Anshuman Pandey. The Unicode proposal was revised in December 2015. 

The Unicode block for Soyombo is U+11A50–U+11AAF:

The Menksoft IMEs provide alternative input methods.

<doc id="287475" wikidata="Q336084" url="?curid=287475" title="Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge">
<text>Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge (Adolphus Charles Alexander Albert Edward George Philip Louis Ladislaus; 13 August 1868 – 24 October 1927), born Prince Adolphus of Teck and later the Duke of Teck, was a relative of the British royal family, a great-grandson of George III and younger brother of Queen Mary, the wife of George V. In 1900, he succeeded his father as Duke of Teck in the Kingdom of Württemberg. He relinquished his German titles in 1917 to become Marquess of Cambridge.

==Early life==
Prince Adolphus of Teck was born on 13 August 1868 at Kensington Palace, London. His father was Prince Francis, Duke of Teck, the eldest son of Duke Alexander of Württemberg and Countess Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde (created the Countess von Hohenstein). His mother was the Duchess of Teck (formerly Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge), the youngest daughter of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, and Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel, granddaughter of George III. Adolphus was styled &quot;His Serene Highness&quot; Prince Adolphus of Teck at birth. With a string of nine Christian names, among his immediate family he was always known as &quot;Dolly&quot;, a pet form of &#x27;Adolphus&#x27;. He was educated at Wellington College in Berkshire.

==Early military career==
Prince Adolphus was a cavalry officer, following in the footsteps of his father, both of his grandfathers, and his maternal uncle. He received his education at Wellington College, before entering the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. At the age of 19, in April 1888, he was commissioned into the British Army as a second lieutenant in the 17th Lancers, the regiment of his maternal uncle, the Duke of Cambridge, who was the commander-in-chief of the British Army from 1856 to 1895. He was promoted lieutenant in January 1893, and transferred to the 1st Life Guards as a captain in June 1895.

==Marriage==
On 12 December 1894, at Eaton Hall, he married Lady Margaret Evelyn Grosvenor (9 April 1873 – 27 March 1929), the daughter of Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster. The couple had four children:

*Prince George of Teck, later 2nd Marquess of Cambridge (11 October 1895 – 16 April 1981); married 1923 Dorothy Hastings (18 May 1899 – 1 April 1988). They had one daughter.
*Princess Mary of Teck, later Lady Mary Cambridge (12 June 1897 – 23 June 1987); married 1923 the 10th Duke of Beaufort (4 April 1900 – 4 February 1984). They had no children.
*Princess Helena of Teck, later Lady Helena Cambridge (23 October 1899 – 22 December 1969); married 1919 Colonel John Evelyn Gibbs (22 December 1879 – 11 October 1932). They had no children.
*Prince Frederick of Teck, later Lord Frederick Cambridge (23 September 1907 – 15 May 1940).

==Duke of Teck and later military career==
In January 1900, Adolphus succeeded his father as Duke of Teck. The new duke served with his regiment during the Boer War 1899–1900, for which he was promoted Brevet major in November 1900. He was later a transport officer in the Household Cavalry. In February 1904, he was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel and appointed a temporary military attaché at the British embassy in Vienna. His appointment as military attaché was confirmed in April 1906, and he received a staff posting the same month. He was promoted to the substantive rank of major in December 1906, and was raised to brevet lieutenant-colonel in November 1910.

With an Order in Council dated 9 June 1911, his brother-in-law King George V, as a gift to mark his own Coronation, granted his cousin the style &quot;His Highness&quot;, which echoed the gift of the King&#x27;s grandmother, Queen Victoria, to the Duke&#x27;s father. The same year he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB). From other nations he received the grand cross of the Order of the Red Eagle of Prussia and the Order of the Star of Romania.

He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 8th Battalion, London Regiment, known as the Post Office Rifles in 1912, relinquishing the position in 1923.

Teck was president of the RSPCA from 1910 to 1916. From 1914 to his death he was Governor and Constable of Windsor Castle.

With the outbreak of the First World War, he returned to active duty, joining his regiment, 1st Life Guards (possibly at Jabeeke Belgium) on 9 October 1914, returning to base (sick) on 19 October 1914. He first served as assistant military secretary at the War Office, and from December 1915 as military secretary to the commander-in-chief of the British Expeditionary Forces (BEF) in France, Sir Douglas Haig, with the temporary rank of brigadier general. He received from allied nations the Belgian Order of Leopold (Grand Cordon) and Croix de guerre, as well as the French Legion of Honour (Grand Officer).

Following ill-health he was placed on half-pay in July 1916, and retired pay in 1919.

==Marquess of Cambridge==
During the First World War, anti-German sentiment in the United Kingdom led Teck&#x27;s brother-in-law, King George V, to change the name of the Royal House from the Germanic House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to the more English-sounding House of Windsor. The King also renounced all his Germanic titles for himself and all members of the British Royal Family who were British subjects.

In response to this, Teck renounced, through a Royal Warrant from the King, dated 14 July 1917, his title of Duke of Teck in the Kingdom of Württemberg and the style &quot;His Highness&quot;. Adolphus, along with his brother, Prince Alexander of Teck, adopted the name Cambridge, after their grandfather, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge.

He was subsequently created Marquess of Cambridge, Earl of Eltham, and Viscount Northallerton all in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His elder son took the title Earl of Eltham as a courtesy title. His younger children became Lord/Lady (Christian Name) Cambridge.

Vera Bate Lombardi, Coco Chanel&#x27;s muse and PR representative, was rumoured to be Adolphus&#x27; illegitimate daughter. Hal Vaughan, in his 2012 biography of Coco Chanel (&#x27;Sleeping with the Enemy: Coco Chanel&#x27;s Secret War&#x27;, p. 42), describes Vera Bate Lombardi as a &#x27;cousin and childhood friend&#x27; of Edward, Prince of Wales.

Lord Cambridge made his home in Shropshire after World War I at Shotton Hall, Harmer Hill, near Shrewsbury. He was active in social life in the county, of which he became a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant in 1923, and Treasurer of the Royal Salop Infirmary at Shrewsbury in 1925. He hosted visits made by his sister to the county, the last in his lifetime being a public visit to Shrewsbury and other parts of Shropshire in August 1927.

==Death==
Lord Cambridge died, aged fifty-nine, after an intestinal operation in October 1927 at a Shrewsbury nursing home, while preparations were being made for another public royal visit to the town (which was consequently cancelled) by his nephew, the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII). He was first buried at St George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Castle and later transferred to the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore. His elder son, the Earl of Eltham, succeeded him as Marquess of Cambridge.

<text>Sarasota–Bradenton International Airport is a public use international airport located within three jurisdictions: Sarasota County, the city limits of Sarasota, and Manatee County, all in the U.S. state of Florida. Owned by the Sarasota Manatee Airport Authority, it is north of Downtown Sarasota and south of Bradenton.

==History==
=== Origins ===
Before the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport was built, both Sarasota and Bradenton had their own airfields: Bradenton&#x27;s Bradenton Airport and Sarasota&#x27;s Lowe Field. Bradenton Airport was established somewhere between 1935 and 1937 being abandoned at an unknown point during World War 2. Lowe Field was dedicated on January 12, 1929 and ended up opening on March 12. It was Sarasota&#x27;s first municipal airport, located on of land west of what was then Oriente Avenue, which is now known as Beneva Road, and north of Fruitville Road. National Airlines began flying out of the airfield on August 4, 1937. Flights were often canceled because the landing strip got too wet to land on, which led to National Airlines leaving later that year after Sarasota could not pay for building concrete runways. During World War II, Lowe Field was used by the Civil Air Patrol. After the war, most civilian operations at Lowe Field went to the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport, with the exception of student pilots, mosquito control programs, and crop dusters. The airport continued operating until 1961 when the owner sold the land.

The airport was considered a replacement for Lowe Field&#x27;s poor conditions and low capacity. Construction on the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport started in 1939 and opened the following year with CCC and WPA assistance at a cost of $1 million. In May 1941, the Sarasota Manatee Airport Authority was created.

==== Name origins ====
In the 1940s, SRQ was known by its two-character designation, RS. By 1948, growth in aviation demand prompted IATA to coordinate the assignment of three-character codes. The airport initially received the designation &quot;SSO&quot;, a short-lived code subject to misinterpretation as the international distress signal, SOS. SRQ was chosen, with &quot;Q&quot; serving as filler text. The airport&#x27;s IATA airport code, &quot;SRQ&quot;, is used as a general nickname for the city of Sarasota and Sarasota area, as exemplified by media outlets like &quot;SRQ Magazine&quot;, WSRQ radio, and numerous local businesses in the area that include SRQ in their names.

=== World War II ===
In 1942, with the United States entering World War 2, the airport was leased to the Army Air Corps and became known as the Sarasota Army Airfield. The Army Air Corps later added 250 acres making the airport 870 acres. The 97th Bombardment Group was the first group, being transferred from MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa for training with B-17 Flying Fortresses staying from March to May. The 97th also performed construction and maintenance, including the construction of barracks and runway repair.

After the 97th left, the 92d Bombardment Group arrived for training and also performed construction work. In June the base was designated as a sub base changing its focus from bombers to fighters because the runways could not withstand the bombers&#x27; weight. The 69th Fighter Squadron transferred to the airfield from Drew Army Airfield to train with P-39 Airacobras. Sarasota had sub bases in: Bartow, St. Petersburg, Fort Myers, and Tampa, while Immokalee, Lake Wales, Punta Gorda and Winter Haven served as auxiliary fields for the base. Training was conducted as well on the base, with 70 pilots graduating on average every 30 days.

On July 25, 1945, a Douglas TC-47B that left out of Sarasota to Lake Charles on a navigation training session crashed after going through a thunderstorm north of Tampa. All 13 crew members died on board. The aircraft crashed roughly 20 miles northeast of Tampa.

After three years of use, the base officially closed and was transferred to civilian usage in 1947. Despite its transfer, the airport and its facilities deteriorated until the Florida Legislature passed the 1955 Sarasota Manatee Airport Authority Act. This act gave the airport more legal power and guidelines to operate.

=== Post-World War II expansion ===
National Airlines was SRQ&#x27;s first airline, moving from Lowe&#x27;s Field by 1947.

Cancer research institute Jackson Memorial Laboratories considered establishing a laboratory on airport property. The extent of the plan is not known.

It was known as Sarasota-Bradenton Airport until 1956 when it got the word &quot;international&quot; added onto it toward the end becoming thus known as Sarasota–Bradenton International Airport. By April 1957, OAG showed six NA departures a day. Construction started on a terminal building designed by Paul Rudolph and locally known architect, John Cromwell, on August 18, 1958, and opening on May 2 the next year. with: a control tower, ticketing area, offices, gift shop, coffee shop, and a balcony for passengers to watch their planes arrive. In its opening year of 1959, the airport had roughly 22,000 annual passengers. Eastern arrived in January 1961, along with an air mail service as well. The airport&#x27;s first jet flights were Eastern 727s in winter 1964–65 (though the longest runway was 5006 ft for a few years after that). By the 1960s the airport along with Eastern and National Airlines, welcomed two commuter airlines: Executive in 1964 and Florida Air in 1968. Executive established Sarasota as a maintenance base and later their headquarters from 1968 to 1971 and flew flights to Tampa and Fort Myers.

=== 1970s ===
By 1970, the airport had five commercial airlines: Eastern, National, Executive, Florida, and for a brief period, Mackey. Despite its continued growth through the 1970s, many airlines services were intermittent. Mackey and Florida both left in early 1970. Florida returned four years later and simultaneously established Sarasota as its headquarters. When Executive Airlines went bankrupt in 1971, it was replaced by Shawnee Airlines for a year and later returned in 1977. On March 30, 1974, an armed man attempted to hijack a Boeing 727 from National Airlines. He brought two hostages with him and demanded to be flown out of the area. He was unsuccessful, as a maintenance worker onboard disarmed him. He was captured about four hours afterwards. He received two concurrent sentences, one for 15 years and another for 25. A commuter airline named Sun Airlines had flights to several destinations from mid-1974 to mid-1975. The latter part of the decade introduced North Central Airlines in 1978, and Delta the following year.

The Airport Authority changed during the 1970s as well. In 1970, voters in Manatee and Sarasota counties decided that the authority should be elected instead of appointed, and state legislation was passed affirming this in 1972.

==== 1976 presidential election ====
During the 1976 presidential election, several candidates visited and/or flew into the airport. On February 23, 1976, Gerald R. Ford and his family flew into the airport on Air Force One while visiting Sarasota on a trip across Florida. He briefly took questions from the press before leaving to go to a hotel. The following day he went to a church service and a barbecue. He gave a brief press conference before flying out of the airport to Tampa. Next month, on March 2, Jimmy Carter held a press conference at the airport before speaking to the public at adjacent New College. Likely that same day, Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson another presidential candidate running on the Democratic ticket, hosted a campaign rally at the airport. George Wallace also visited the airport two days later on March 4.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a controversial proposal to move the airport by both Sarasota County and Manatee County due to airport overcrowding. An opinion poll was held in 1970, with 66% of voters voting against a new airport. The proposal suggested making the facility into a general aviation airport and constructing a replacement east of future Interstate 75 within Lakewood Ranch. Opposition to the airport also came from a local environmentalist, Gloria Rains, who was the head and founder of ManaSota-88, an environmental group. Rains would later oppose the development of Lakewood Ranch as well, but did like that natural features in the area were preserved. However, the airport authority struck down the idea in 1985. When a referendum was held in 1986 on the matter (as required under state law if they wanted to move the airport) it was struck down. 

Instead of building a new airport, the airport&#x27;s facilities, in general, would be expanded. Work began in 1987 to build a new airport terminal along with areas for parking, ramp space and landscaping. The new terminal building opened on October 29, 1989. During the first day the new airport terminal was in operation, the &quot;Sarasota Herald-Tribune&quot; reported that passengers and airline staff liked it. On its first day of operations the airport was still under construction and several problems were encountered: the computer system on the upstairs level security checkpoint area had glitches, along with problems being reported with the terminal&#x27;s air conditioning. The rest of the project was finished by 1990.

A facility for commuter flights was added onto the airport in 1983.

The airport was designated port of entry status in 1992.

===September 11 attacks===
Air Force One was at the airport on September 11, 2001. George W. Bush was at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota when Andrew Card first informed him of the September 11, 2001 attacks, at 9:05 AM. Bush left the school at 9:32 AM after making a statement about the attacks and returned to the airport at 9:44 AM. Air Force One taxied out at 9:54 AM and took off from runway 14 at 9:55 AM, employing the emergency capability of the VC-25 to perform a &quot;rocket-like climb&quot;. It flew first to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

===2003 – present===
In 2003, AirTran Airways began service at SRQ to Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and Baltimore–Washington International Airport, and by 2011 the airline served six U.S. cities nonstop from SRQ.

In January 2012, AirTran Airways announced that it would drop SRQ on August 12, 2012, as part of its merger with Southwest Airlines. Despite this, Southwest Airlines began service to SRQ in February 2021.

==== Late 2010s and the 2020s ====
Construction on a new aircraft control tower started in November 2015 and was finished in 2017. Starting in the late 2010s, the airport started to rapidly grow in passenger traffic in a move mostly credited to Allegiant beginning to service the airport. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the airport was one of the fastest growing in the United States.

On December 19, 2019, a GMC pickup truck crashed into the baggage claim, causing $250,000 in damage.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in air traffic significantly declining similar to other airports in the United States, but it was among the least impacted airports nationally. Despite a decline in the number of passengers several new flights were added/announced. Elite Airways expanded operations at the airport in 2021 when they started nonstop flights to White Plains, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Nantucket and Portland, Maine on July 2. Passenger numbers in 2021 ended up being 70% higher than before the pandemic, and a one-year passenger traffic record set in 1990 was broken in a span of eight months. Avelo Airlines announced in August 2023 that a new flight would be added to Wilmington, Delaware with service beginning in November and the first flight occurred on November 2.

To accommodate for recent growth, the airport broke ground on a second concourse on March 27, 2023. The new concourse, known as Concourse A, opened in January 2025 with five gates, bar, café, a restaurant, and a marketplace. The addition of Concourse A is expected to increase passenger capacity by 2.5 million.

Hurricane Milton caused significant damage to the airport, including losing the entire roof of Concourse B. On October 11, 2024, the airport stated that it would remain closed until October 16.

==Facilities==
The airport covers at an elevation of . It has two asphalt runways: 14/32 is 9,500 by 150 feet (2,896 x 46 m) and 04/22 is 5,006 by 150 feet (1,526 x 46 m).

In the year ending October 31, 2023, the airport had 163,082 aircraft operations, an average of 446 per day: 70% general aviation, 20% airline, 9% air taxi, and 1% military. 340 aircraft were then based at this airport: 235 single-engine, 64 jet, 27 multi-engine, and 14 helicopter.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) for 2023–2027 categorized it a &quot;small hub&quot; airport since it enplanes 0.05 percent to 0.25 percent of total U.S. passenger enplanements.

===Terminal===
The airport contains one terminal with a total of 18 gates on two concourses.

*Concourse A contains 5 gates (Gates A4-A8). Concourse A is a ground-level concourse on the west side of the terminal. It is used exclusively by Allegiant Air.
*Concourse B contains 13 gates (Gates B1-B12, B14). Concourse B is in the center of the terminal on the second level and is used by all other airlines. All gates in Concourse B have jet bridges. Customs and Immigration services for international flights are located on the lower level of Concourse B. 

The terminal opened on October 29, 1989. Upon opening, the terminal included Concourse B and a small commuter concourse on the west end of the ticket counter (Gates D1-D4). The D gates were exclusively for ground-boarded commuter flights by airlines including Comair, American Eagle, and Air Sunshine. The D Gates had its own security checkpoint and baggage claim. The D Gates were closed in the early 2000s due to a reduction in commuter flights. The holding area for the D Gates was walled off from the ticketing area upon its closure, and later the space was converted to other uses including a large conference room.

On March 27, 2023, the airport broke ground on the terminal&#x27;s first major expansion. The 75,300 square foot expansion included the addition of Concourse A, which opened in January 2025.

===Airport security and fire services===

The Sarasota-Manatee Airport Authority Police Department is an independent, Florida Department of Law Enforcement certified law enforcement agency located in Sarasota, Florida. The department is responsible for the security and protection of the assets of the airport including the terminals, tarmac, runway, FBO terminals, cargo facilities and buildings leased to third parties on airport property. Because Sarasota–Bradenton International Airport is located within two neighboring counties (Sarasota and Manatee) officers are authorized to conduct investigations and arrested within the confine of both counties on and off and adjacent to the airport. Like most law enforcement agencies in Florida and in the United States the Department utilizes Ford Crown Victoria&#x27;s for patrols.

The Sarasota-Manatee Airport Authority Rescue and Firefighting Services is a certified by the State of Florida and the FAA to provide fire fighting and medical rescue services at the airport including the terminals, tarmac, runway, FBO terminals, cargo facilities and airport buildings leased to third parties on airport property and like the airport police the ARFF has authority to operate and respond to fire and rescue calls in both Sarasota and Manatee counties.

The following law enforcement and fire services provide mutual aid to the Sarasota-Manatee Airport Authority Police and ARFF in the event of a major incident. For portions of the airport within the City of Sarasota, city&#x27;s police department and fire rescue respond, in the unincorporated areas of airport in Sarasota County are responded by the Sarasota County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, Sarasota County Fire and Rescue and the Cedar Hammock Fire Control District, in the airport&#x27;s unincorporated areas in Manatee County mutual aid is responded to by the Manatee County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and the Manatee County Fire Department.

<doc id="287479" wikidata="Q1514665" url="?curid=287479" title="Ishpatina Ridge">
<text>Ishpatina Ridge is the highest point of land in the Canadian province of Ontario, at an estimated above sea level. Ishpatina Ridge rises approximately above the immediate area. It was only truly recognized as Ontario&#x27;s highest point after topographical mapping by the Government of Canada revealed this fact in the 1970s. Before then, the more popular Maple Mountain was thought to be higher.

The ridge lies in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park. Due to its remote location, Ishpatina Ridge is a challenge to reach. The closest major highway, Highway 560, is more than 30 km north. There are a few logging roads and trails in the remote area, but they are difficult to travel in poor weather. The most popular approach route to Ishpatina is by canoe/portage via a logging road to the south out of the town of Capreol north of Sudbury. While a northern route exists (out of Gowganda, the nearest community), there are numerous portages making it particularly onerous. This route has traditionally been used for a winter-time approach by ski/snowshoe. Historically, a fire tower atop the ridge was staffed by forest workers and they would have been ferried to the site by float plane.

The name &quot;Ishpatina&quot; comes from an Ojibwe language word &quot;ishpadinaa&quot;, meaning &quot;high place/ridge&quot;. Spadina Avenue in Toronto and the city of Ishpeming, Michigan derive their names from the same word.

Although the Ishpatina Ridge is the highest point in Ontario, at least one other geographic feature, Maple Mountain (approximately 25 km to the east) has greater prominence, higher than Ishpatina Ridge&#x27;s rise over Scarecrow Lake.

An abandoned firetower, often referred to as the Ellis Tower, is still standing on the highest section of the Ridge (left). The original tower was an 80 ft structure erected in 1930. The successor, currently standing, is high and was abandoned in the 1960s. The towerman would have resided in a cabin on the shore of Scarecrow Lake and would have hiked a 3.5 km trail daily taking approximately two hours to the summit and a little over one hour to descend again.

Located between Tower Peak and the North Peak, the Ishpatina Canyon is one of the deepest in Ontario. The elevation of Tower Peak is , the bottom of the Canyon is at and the North Peak at above sea level. The canyon is nearly twice as deep as Ouimet Canyon, often considered Ontario&#x27;s deepest. However, the more gradual descent into the canyon hides the fact.

The ridge was featured on an interactive web series called The Peakbaggers.

<doc id="287485" wikidata="Q242656" url="?curid=287485" title="Madeleine Carroll">
<text>Marie-Madeleine Bernadette O&#x27;Carroll (26 February 1906 – 2 October 1987) was an English actress, popular both in Britain and in America in the 1930s and 1940s. At the peak of her success in 1938, she was the world&#x27;s highest-paid actress.

Carroll is remembered for starring in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935) where she originated the &quot;ice cold blonde&quot; role in Hitchcock films. The director stated, &quot;how very well Madeleine fitted into the part. I had heard a lot about her as a tall, cold, blonde beauty. After meeting her, I made up my mind to present her to the public as her natural self&quot;. She is also noted for largely abandoning her acting career after the death of her sister Marguerite in the London Blitz to devote herself to helping wounded servicemen and children displaced or maimed by the war. She was awarded both the Legion d&#x27;Honneur and the Medal of Freedom for her work with the Red Cross.

==Early life==
Carroll was born at 32 Herbert Street (now number 44) in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, daughter of John Carroll, an Irish professor of languages from County Limerick, and Helene, his French wife. She graduated from the University of Birmingham, with a B.A. degree in languages. While at university she appeared in some productions for the Birmingham University Dramatic Society. She was a French mistress at a girls&#x27; school in Hove for a year.

==Acting career==
===Early years===
Carroll&#x27;s father opposed her taking up acting, but with her mother’s support she quit teaching and traveled to London to look for stage work. She had won a beauty contest, and got a job in Seymour Hicks&#x27; touring company, making her stage debut in 1927 in &quot;The Lash&quot;. The following year she made her screen debut in &quot;The Guns of Loos&quot;, and then starred alongside Miles Mander in &quot;The First Born&quot;, written by Alma Reville. Thence she met Reville&#x27;s husband, Alfred Hitchcock.

===Film stardom===
Carroll was the lead in her second film, &quot;What Money Can Buy&quot; (1928) with Humberston Wright. She followed it with &quot;The First Born&quot; (1928) with Miles Mander, which really established her in films. Carroll went to France to make &quot;Not So Stupid&quot; (1928). Back in Britain she starred in &quot;The Crooked Billet&quot; (1929) and &quot;The American Prisoner&quot; (1929), both shot in silent and sound versions. In 1930, she starred in &quot;Atlantic&quot;, then co-starred with Brian Aherne in &quot;The W Plan&quot; (1930). In France she was in &quot;Instinct&quot; (1930). On stage, Carroll appeared in &quot;The Roof&quot; (1929) for Basil Dean, &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot;, &quot;Mr Pickwick&quot; (opposite Charles Laughton) and an adaptation of &quot;Beau Geste&quot;.

The same year, Carroll starred in the controversial &quot;Young Woodley&quot; (1930), followed by a farce, &quot;French Leave&quot; (1930). She had a support role in an early adaptation of &quot;Escape&quot; (1930) and was the female lead in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; (1930) and &quot;Kissing Cup&#x27;s Race&quot; (1930). Carroll starred as a French aristocrat in &quot;Madame Guillotine&quot; (1931) with Aherne, then did another with Mander, &quot;Fascination&quot; (1931). She was in &quot;The Written Law&quot; (1931), then signed a contract with Gaumont British for whom she made &quot;Sleeping Car&quot; (1932) with Ivor Novello.

She had a big hit with &quot;I Was a Spy&quot; (1933), which won her an award as best actress of the year. It was directed by Victor Saville. Carroll played the title role in the play &quot;Little Catherine&quot;. Abruptly, she announced plans to retire from films to devote herself to a private life with her husband, the first of four. Carroll went to Hollywood to appear in &quot;The World Moves On&quot; (1934) for Fox; John Ford directed and Franchot Tone co starred. Back in England she was in &quot;The Dictator&quot; (1935) for Saville, playing Caroline Matilda of Great Britain.

===Work for Hitchcock===

Carroll attracted the attention of Alfred Hitchcock and in 1935 starred as the director&#x27;s earliest prototypical cool, glib, intelligent blonde in &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;. Based on the espionage novel by John Buchan, the film became a sensation and with it so did Carroll. Cited by &quot;The New York Times&quot; for a performance that was &quot;charming and skillful&quot;, Carroll became very much in demand. Of Hitchcock heroines as exemplified by Carroll, film critic Roger Ebert wrote: The female characters in his films reflected the same qualities over and over again: They were blonde. They were icy and remote. They were imprisoned in costumes that subtly combined fashion with fetishism. They mesmerised the men, who often had physical or psychological handicaps. Sooner or later, every Hitchcock woman was humiliated.

The filmmaker and actor Orson Welles called the film a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and screenwriter Robert Towne remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s not much of an exaggeration to say that all contemporary escapist entertainment begins with &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;.&quot; At the end of the century it was ranked fourth in the BFI Top 100 British films. Following on from this success Hitchcock wanted to re-team Carroll with her &quot;39 Steps&quot; co-star Robert Donat the following year in &quot;Secret Agent&quot;, a spy thriller based on a work by W. Somerset Maugham. However, Donat&#x27;s recurring health problems intervened, resulting in a Carroll–John Gielgud pairing. In between the films she made a short drama &quot;The Story of Papworth&quot; (1935).

===Hollywood===

Achieving international stardom with &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;, Carroll was the first British beauty to be offered a major American film contract. She accepted a lucrative deal with Paramount Pictures and was cast opposite George Brent in &quot;The Case Against Mrs. Ames&quot; (1936). She followed this with &quot;The General Died at Dawn&quot; (1936), and was borrowed by 20th Century Fox to play the female lead in &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s of London&quot; (1936) which made a star of Tyrone Power. She stayed at the studio to make &quot;On the Avenue&quot; (1937), a musical with Dick Powell and Alice Faye.

Carroll went to Columbia for &quot;It&#x27;s All Yours&quot; (1937) then was cast by David O. Selznick as Ronald Colman&#x27;s love interest in the 1937 box-office success &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;. Walter Wanger put her in &quot;Blockade&quot; (1938) with Henry Fonda, about the Spanish Civil War. Back at Paramount she made some comedies with Fred MacMurray, &quot;Cafe Society&quot; (1939) and &quot;Honeymoon in Bali&quot; (1939). Edward Small gave her top billing in &quot;My Son, My Son!&quot; (1940) with Aherne.

She starred in &quot;Safari&quot; (1940) then played against Gary Cooper in &quot;North West Mounted Police&quot; (1940), directed by Cecil B. DeMille. Paramount put Carroll opposite MacMurray in &quot;Virginia&quot; (1941) and &quot;One Night in Lisbon&quot; (1941). &quot;Virginia&quot; also starred Sterling Hayden who was reteamed with Carroll in &quot;Bahama Passage&quot; (1941). Carroll was Bob Hope&#x27;s love interest in &quot;My Favorite Blonde&quot; (1942).

===Radio and theatre===
On radio, Carroll was a participant in &quot;The Circle&quot; (1939) on NBC, discussing &quot;current events, literature and drama&quot; each week. In 1944, she was the host of &quot;This Is the Story&quot;, an anthology series dramatising famous novels on the Mutual Broadcasting System. At the tail end of radio&#x27;s golden age, Carroll starred in the NBC soap opera &quot;The Affairs of Dr. Gentry&quot; (1957–59). She also was one of a group of four stars who rotated in taking the lead in each week&#x27;s episode of &quot;The NBC Radio Theater&quot; (1959).

In 1948 she made her debut on Broadway as Agatha Reed in Fay Kanin&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye, My Fancy&quot;; a role later portrayed by Joan Crawford in the 1951 film adaptation.

===Return to Britain===
Carroll returned to Britain after the war. She was in &quot;White Cradle Inn&quot; (1947). She went back to the US and was reunited with MacMurray for &quot;An Innocent Affair&quot; (1948). Her last film was &quot;The Fan&quot; (1949).

==Awards==
In 1946, Carroll was awarded France&#x27;s Legion of Honour for her overseas work, during World War II, liaising between the forces of the United States Army and the French Resistance, and her post-war fostering of amity between France and the United States.

For her contributions to the film industry, Carroll was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star located at 6707 Hollywood Boulevard.

A commemorative monument and plaques were unveiled in her birthplace, West Bromwich, to mark the centenary of her birth. Her story is one of rare courage and dedication when at the height of her success she gave up her acting career during World War II to work in the line of fire on troop trains for the Red Cross in Italy after her sister was killed by a German air raid – for which she was awarded the American Medal of Freedom.

==Personal life==

Carroll married her first husband, Colonel Philip Reginald Astley, in 1931; they divorced in 1939. He was an estate agent, big-game hunter and soldier. In 1941, she starred opposite Sterling Hayden in &quot;Virginia&quot;. The following year they married, divorcing in 1946. After her only sister, Marguerite, was killed in World War II&#x27;s London Blitz, Carroll made a radical shift from acting to working in field hospitals as a Red Cross nurse. Having become a naturalised American citizen in 1943, she served at the American Army Air Force&#x27;s 61st Station Hospital in Foggia, Italy, in 1944, where wounded airmen flying out of area&#x27;s air bases were hospitalised. She earned the rank of captain and received the Medal of Freedom for her nursing service.

Carroll first visited Spain&#x27;s Costa Brava in 1934. The following year she bought an estate in Calonge, where her seaside home, Castell Madeleine, was constructed. She was prevented from living there by the Spanish Civil War and World War II and moved to Marbella in 1949. The home was later demolished, leaving one tower intact, and a housing development named after it (Urbanización Castell Madeleine). During the war, Carroll donated another property of hers, a château she owned outside Paris, to house more than one hundred and fifty orphans, arranging for groups of young people in California to knit clothing for them. In an RKO-Pathe News bulletin she was filmed at the château with children and staff wearing the donated clothes thanking those who contributed. She was awarded the Légion d&#x27;Honneur for her efforts by France. Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower remarked in private that, of all the movie stars he met in Europe during the war, he was most impressed with Carroll and Herbert Marshall (who worked with military amputees).

After the war, Carroll stayed in Europe where she conducted a radio program fostering French-American friendship and helped in the rehabilitation of concentration camp victims, during which she met her future third husband, the French producer Henri Lavorel. In late 1946, she went briefly to Switzerland to film a British film, &quot;White Cradle Inn&quot; (aka &quot;High Fury&quot;).

On her return to Paris, she and Lavorel formed a production company and made several two-reel documentaries to promote peace, one of which, &quot;Children&#x27;s Republic&quot;, was shown at the Cannes Film Festival. Carroll told &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; that &quot;wars are started at the top but can be prevented at the bottom, if all men and women will rid themselves of distrust and suspicion of that which is foreign.&quot; Filmed in a small orphanage in the town of Sèvres, just southwest of Paris, it focused attention on the devastation of children&#x27;s lives in Europe caused by war. Widely shown in Canada, it became a prime source of funds for the manufacture of artificial limbs for wounded children.

In 1947, Carroll returned to the United States together with Lavorel. Their intention was for her to resume her acting career, which would fund their production company, but they soon separated. Appearing in three more films until 1949 and debuting on Broadway in 1948, Carroll then mostly retired from acting, although she did occasionally appear on television and radio until the mid-1960s.

She married Andrew Heiskell, publisher of &quot;Life&quot;, in 1950, and they had a daughter Anne Madeleine in 1951. They divorced in 1965. By then, Carroll had moved to Paris. She later moved to Spain, where she shared an estate with her mother and her daughter. Her mother died in 1975 and her daughter, having relocated to New York, died in 1983.

==Death==
Carroll died on 2 October 1987, aged 81, in Marbella, Spain, from pancreatic cancer and is buried in the cemetery of Sant Antoni de Calonge in Catalonia.

<doc id="287492" wikidata="Q652030" url="?curid=287492" title="Melbourne Orlando International Airport">
<text>Melbourne Orlando International Airport is a public airport northwest of downtown Melbourne, in Brevard County, Florida, United States, and southeast of Orlando, located on central Florida&#x27;s Space Coast. The airport is reached by NASA Boulevard (State Road 508). It is governed by a seven-member board which is appointed by the Melbourne City Council and the private sector. The airport budget is part of the Melbourne municipal budget; the airport receives no local tax dollars. The projected expenses for 2010 were $14.1million. The executive director of the airport is Greg Donovan, A.A.E.

Previously named Melbourne International Airport, in 2015 the airport had been renamed Orlando Melbourne International Airport. However, due to a lawsuit claiming this name was misleading to passengers, the airport changed its name to Melbourne Orlando International Airport in May 2021.

==History==
===Early years===
Melbourne International Airport began in 1928 when a Pitcairn Aircraft landed on a cow pasture strip north of Kissimmee Highway. Airmail service started in late 1928 when the airport was designated a fueling stop. In 1933 the City of Melbourne acquired west of Indian River Bluff to develop as a new airport, which was further developed and operated as Naval Air Station Melbourne during World War II.

Returned to the city as a Surplus Property Airport after the War, Melbourne Airport was deeded to the city in 1947. It was a municipal airport until 1967 when the city created the Melbourne Airport Authority to plan, operate, maintain, and develop the airport, then called Melbourne Municipal Airport. The name was Cape Kennedy Regional Airport and city officials changed the name to Melbourne Regional Airport in 1973 to better reflect its role.

In January 1951, the airport had runways 04/22, 09/27, 13/31 and 16/34, all being listed as being long. Scheduled airline flights began in 1953. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide listed four Eastern Airlines departures, Martin 4-0-4s to Vero Beach, Daytona Beach and Jacksonville. National Airlines arrived in 1959 with Douglas DC-6Bs and scheduled the first jet airliner flights in 1963: Douglas DC-8s Miami–Melbourne–New Orleans–Houston–Los Angeles and Los Angeles–Houston–Melbourne–Miami.

In 1960, Meadowlane Elementary School first opened at a Naval hospital on the airport grounds. The school moved to West Melbourne in 1961. In 1969, a National DC-8 flew Los Angeles–Tampa–Melbourne–Miami. Houston and Los Angeles figured in NASA&#x27;s space program, and Melbourne was close to the NASA Kennedy Space Center. In July 1974 a National Boeing 727 flew Miami–Melbourne–Tampa–New Orleans–Los Angeles–San Diego; National Boeing 727-200s flew direct Houston and New Orleans to Melbourne. In May 1979 National had one flight a day from Melbourne, a 727-200 to Tampa.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Eastern Airlines Boeing 727s, Douglas DC-9s and Lockheed Electras flew out of the airport. In June 1967 Eastern announced &quot;The Space Corridor&quot; from Melbourne to three centers in the space program: Huntsville, Alabama, St. Louis and Seattle. Eastern&#x27;s &quot;Space Corridor&quot; was a Melbourne-Orlando-Huntsville-St. Louis-Seattle Boeing 727-100. In June 1967 Eastern flew nonstop Melbourne to Atlanta, Tampa and Ft. Lauderdale and direct to New York City (JFK Airport), Washington, D.C. (Dulles Airport), Boston and Miami. In February 1976 Eastern flew a 727 direct Los Angeles to Melbourne via Atlanta; Eastern eventually dropped Melbourne upon the airlines closure in 1991.

In the early 1980s some ending scenes for the film &quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot; were shot in the Melbourne area, including several plot scenes shot at the airport (as listed in the credits).People Express Airlines started nonstops to Newark, Baltimore, Columbus and Buffalo, New York in spring 1982 with Boeing 737 jets. They eventually scaled back to just nonstops to Newark and ended service to MLB in 1986. Delta Air Lines started nonstops to Atlanta in 1983 with DC-9s and upgraded to Boeing 737s and MD-80s. In 1999 Spirit Airlines began commercial service to the airport.

The Authority operated a recreational vehicle site, &quot;Port O&#x27; Call&quot;. This was closed and the tenants evicted in 2003. The intent was to use the property for commercial development. The Melbourne Airport Authority operates Tropical Haven (formerly Trailer Haven), a 760-site manufactured home park.

===Development since the 2010s===
In 2010 the airport had nonstop flights to Atlanta on Delta Air Lines and regional partner Atlantic Southeast Airlines, as well as nonstops to Charlotte Douglas International Airport on US Airways&#x27; regional subsidiary PSA Airlines. These flights continue on Delta and American. Delta used to fly nonstop from Melbourne to its hubs in Cincinnati, New York–Kennedy and New York–La Guardia, and to Washington–Dulles and Washington–Reagan; all of this was discontinued. USA3000 Airlines briefly served Melbourne with flights to Baltimore/Washington. Presidential Airways (scheduled) had nonstop flights to Daytona Beach and Washington, DC (Dulles), with Boeing 737s and BAE-146 Jets. American Airlines served Melbourne with flights to Raleigh/Durham on MD-80 jets and Continental flew to Newark Liberty with 727 and 737 aircraft. Direct Air flew to Niagara Falls, New York, and Punta Gorda, Florida, with 737 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets.

Elite Airways began operating at the airport in 2014 with flights to Washington Dulles International Airport.

In 2015, there were an estimated 15,000 paid attendees to the annual air show over a two-day weekend.

The airport&#x27;s first scheduled international service was announced by Porter Airlines in September 2015 to Toronto&#x27;s island airport. The airline discontinued service to the airport in 2019.

In 2015, the airport changed its name to &quot;Orlando Melbourne International Airport&quot;. Airport and local tourism officials wanted to brand the airport as a less-congested alternative to Orlando&#x27;s other two commercial airports, Orlando International Airport and Orlando Sanford International Airport. The airport also believed the name change would attract visitors who wanted to see Walt Disney World, Cape Canaveral, and the area&#x27;s beaches. The airport is located approximately southeast of the City of Orlando.

In 2017, a $20million upgrade was proposed for the airport, 90percent coming from the Federal Aviation Administration, almost $1million from the Florida Department of Transportation and $1million from the airport.

In November 2019, British tour operator and airline TUI Airways announced that, from 2022, they would switch their Orlando operations from their current base at Sanford to Melbourne. This announcement will see a total of 17 weekly flights to/from eight British airports and is to bring their operations nearer to Port Canaveral where TUI&#x27;s Marella Cruises will sail from in coming years. As a package tour operator, this brings passengers closer to their cruises, although it has angered many TUI passengers who fly with the company to visit Orlando with Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando Resort due to the extended airport transfer time.

In July 2021, the airport announced a $61million renovation and expansion, in part to prepare for the arrival of TUI Airways&#x27; operations from the United Kingdom.

==Facilities and aircraft==

The airport covers 2,420 acres (979 ha) and has three asphalt runways: 09R/27L is 10,181 × 150 ft (3,103 × 46 m), 09L/27R is 6,000 × 150 ft (1,829 × 46 m) and 05/23 is 3,001 × 75 ft (915 × 23 m). The main terminal building is named the Edward L. Foster Air Terminal.

In the year ending December 31, 2020, the airport had 103,660 aircraft operations, average 284 per day; 93% were general aviation, 4% scheduled commercial, 2% air taxi and less than 1% military. 264 aircraft at the time were based at this airport: 186 single-engine, 42 multi-engine, 26 jet, 9 helicopter, and 1 military.

The Airport Museum was in the terminal building. However, the new expansion that occurred, demolished the museum and replaced with a news and gift shop.

The Florida Institute of Technology Research, Science and Technology Park covers about surrounded by airport tenants such as Northrop Grumman, GE Railway, Rockwell Collins, DRS Technologies, and L3 Harris, and leases property to two hospitals and one hotel.

A new Embraer Business Jet Assembly Facility, intended to employ 200 workers, is under construction. Production facilities are for the Phenom 100 and 300, and Legacy 450 and 500.

In 2010 two companies, AAR Corporation and MidAirUSA, announced plans for facilities at the airport. The companies intended to respectively employ 225 and 300 people. MidAirUSA went bankrupt in 2015; Aeromod International took over the MidAirUSA hangar in 2016.

===Public safety===
The airport is served by the Melbourne Airport Authority Police Department for law enforcement services, and by the Melbourne Fire Department for fire and rescue services.

It offers flight training for fixed wing aircraft for the FAA Private Pilot Certification, Instrument Rating, Commercial Pilot Certification, and Multi-Engine and Advanced Aircraft Training. In 1999, to match a grant for a new engineering building, Florida Tech sold nearly a third of its training fleet.
*Melbourne Flight Training

==Incidents at MLB==
*On March 17, 1958, an Eastern Air Lines Martin 4-0-4 (flight # unknown) on final approach to MLB struck an unmarked pile of gravel at the approach end of the runway.

It is owned by the Naples Airport Authority. The airport is home to flight schools, air charter operators, car rental agencies, and corporate aviation and non-aviation businesses. The airport is also a central location for public services, including fire/rescue services, mosquito control, the Collier County Sheriff&#x27;s Aviation Unit and other community services.

During fiscal year 2021–2022, the airport serviced 113,137 operations. The airport is used almost exclusively for general aviation, with one airline, JSX, offering scheduled passenger service as of 2025.

==History==
The facility was established in 1942 as Naples Army Air Field by the United States Army Air Forces. It was initially assigned to the Southeast Training Center (later Eastern Flying Training Command), and provided basic (level 1) flight training to flight cadets by Embry-Riddle Co; Fairchild PT-19s were the primary trainers used. Along with the flight training, it was a sub-base to Buckingham Army Air Field for flexible gunnery training, which the 75th Flying Training Wing supervised. It was inactivated as a military airfield in November 1945 and turned over to the War Assets Administration for conveyance to civil control as a public airport.

The Naples Airdrome was returned to the city of Naples and Collier County in 1947, after the military deemed it no longer necessary. The airport was managed by John Zate, a pilot and Naples resident. Provincetown-Boston Airlines began scheduled service to Miami International Airport in the 1950s, and managed the airport for several years until a municipal airport authority was created in 1969. Also in 1969 the eye of Tropical Storm Jenny passed through the bottom left wing and top left wing of the airport and cause over $10,000+ in damage. The airport also historically had scheduled service to Orlando, Tampa, St. Pete–Clearwater, Miami and Key West under PBA in the late 1970s. Traffic at the airport peaked in 1980, when more than 195,000 passengers used the airport, but fell in the mid-1980s due to the opening of the much larger Southwest Florida International Airport in nearby Fort Myers. The airport code APF derives from &quot;alternate Page Field&quot; - which is a reference to Page Field in Fort Myers.

The airport experienced a rebound in traffic during the mid-1990s, with 173,000 passengers and seven airlines in 1995. Passenger numbers dipped when American Eagle ceased scheduled service to Miami in 2001, and dipped even further following the September 11, 2001, attacks. In 2003, US Airways Express ceased its service from Naples to Tampa. Atlantic Southeast Airlines operated Delta Connection flights between Naples and Atlanta from 2004 to 2007 with a revenue guarantee from the city, but ended the service after retiring its fleet of 30-seat aircraft, again leaving the airport without scheduled service. Yellow Air Taxi had flights to Fort Lauderdale and Key West, but the service was ended in December 2008. Elite Airways also began scheduled service to the airport in February 2016, with flights to Portland (ME), Newark, Vero Beach, and Melbourne (FL), but ended in March 2017 due to low passenger counts.

In December 2018, the airport authority changed the facility&#x27;s name from Naples Municipal Airport to Naples Airport. They also changed the airport&#x27;s logo to a more modern one.

<doc id="287509" wikidata="Q1861706" url="?curid=287509" title="List of Syriac Orthodox patriarchs of Antioch">
<text>The Syriac Orthodox patriarch of Antioch and All the East is the head of the Syriac Orthodox Church. According to tradition, the patriarchate of Antioch was established by Saint Peter in the 1st century AD, but split into two separate lines of patriarchs after the deposition of Patriarch Severus of Antioch in 518 over the issue of the Council of Chalcedon of 451. The non-Chalcedonian supporters of Severus went on to form what is now known as the Syriac Orthodox Church, whilst the Chalcedonians developed the church now known as the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch.

The Syriac Orthodox Church underwent schism in the medieval era, first, after the death of Patriarch Philoxenus I Nemrud in 1292 with the formation of separate patriarchates of Mardin and Melitene, and again in 1364 due to the emergence of a patriarchate of Tur Abdin. Unity was restored to the church gradually as the patriarchate at Melitene came to an end in , and the patriarchate of Mardin lapsed after its patriarch Ignatius Behnam Hadloyo was acknowledged as patriarch of Antioch in 1445. A line of patriarchs in communion with the Catholic Church split permanently in 1782, and thus formed the Syriac Catholic Church. 

The current patriarch of Antioch of the Syriac Orthodox Church is Ignatius Aphrem II.

===Syriac Orthodox patriarchs from 1292 to 1445===
On the death of Patriarch Philoxenus I Nemrud in 1292, the Syriac Orthodox Church split into the patriarchates of Antioch, Mardin, and Melitene. A separate patriarchate of Tur Abdin broke off from the patriarchate of Mardin in 1364.

<text>Pensacola International Airport , formerly Pensacola Gulf Coast Regional Airport and Pensacola Regional Airport (Hagler Field), and temporarily branded Pensacola Intergalactic Airport each February in recognition of the local Pensacon convention, is a public use airport northeast of the central business district of Pensacola, in Escambia County, Florida, United States. It is owned by the City of Pensacola. Despite its name, the airport does not offer scheduled international flights, though chartered international flights are not uncommon. This airport is one of five major airports in North Florida, and among these is the second largest by passenger count, only behind Jacksonville. The other four airports in North Florida are: Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport, Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport, Tallahassee International Airport, and Jacksonville International Airport.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2021–2025, in which it is categorized as a small-hub primary commercial service facility. As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 771,917 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 694,786 enplanements in 2009, and 729,748 in 2010. In 2018, the airport served 1.9 million passengers.

In 2023, the airport set an all-time record with 2,731,604 passengers served.

==History==
In 1935, a passenger terminal opened, and airline service began two years later. Atlantic and Gulf Airlines went out of business a few months later after failing to get an airmail contract. In 1938 National Airlines began flights to Mobile and Jacksonville. From 1940 to 1945, the airport was a U.S. Navy training facility; the Navy built a control tower and added a fourth runway. In 1947 Eastern Air Lines began service out of Pensacola, and in 1952 a modern terminal replaced the original one. The airport was then dedicated to L.C. Hagler, the former mayor of Pensacola. In 1968 Eastern began the first scheduled jet service from Pensacola.

In 1978, after deregulation of the airline industry, several airlines began serving Pensacola, including Continental and Delta. In 1978 a National Airlines Boeing 727 crashed into Escambia Bay while on approach for landing, the first fatal airline accident in the area. In 1979 US Airways, then called USAir, arrived at Pensacola. In 1990 the current terminal was built and AirTran Airways began jet service in 2001. In 2005 United Express began service out of Pensacola. After stopping service to Pensacola in the 1990s, American Airlines (operating as American Eagle) began service again in Pensacola in 2004. Southwest Airlines initiated service to Pensacola in 2013 after purchasing Airtran Airways. Frontier Airlines initiated service at Pensacola in 2018.

Pensacola mayor Ashton Hayward announced on November 9, 2011, that the airport would change its name from Pensacola Gulf Coast Regional Airport to Pensacola International Airport, effective immediately.

==Facilities and aircraft==
Pensacola Regional Airport covers an area of 1,211 acres (490 ha) at an elevation of 121 feet (37 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways: 17/35 is 7,004 by 150 feet (2,135 x 46 m) with a concrete surface; 08/26 is 7,000 by 150 feet (2,134 x 46 m) with an asphalt surface.

Runway 17 has an instrument landing system and approach lights, while the Runway 26 approach has a localizer approach. A 1,000 ft. extension to the east end of Runway 08/26 was completed in 2006. The airport hopes to extend Runway 17/35 to about 8,500 ft.

The airport&#x27;s two war-era diagonal runways were decommissioned in the 1960s.

For the 12-month period ending January 31, 2024, the airport had 157,103 aircraft operations, an average of 430 per day: 58% general aviation, 19% military, 16% commercial and 8% air taxi. At the end of January 2024, there were 172 aircraft based at this airport: 141 single-engine, 10 multi-engine, 18 jet, and 3 helicopter.

==Terminal==
Pensacola has one passenger terminal with 12 gates, built in the early 1990s. Gates 1 through 10 are located on the 2nd floor, while Gates 11 and 12 are located on the ground floor. 
Gate assignments:
* American: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
* Delta: 2, 4
* Silver: 11
* Southwest: 10
* United: 1, 3
* Frontier: 6, 8, 10
* Spirit: 8
* Breeze: 9

===Terminal expansion===
The terminal was expanded in 2011 at a cost of $35 million. The expansion was designed by Gresham, Smith, and Partners and Stoa Architects.

In 2022, it was announced that the city of Pensacola was looking into a $70 million concourse and parking expansion that would provide more space to handle the airport&#x27;s rapid increase in passenger numbers and flights.

==Management==
The airport is operated as a self-funding department of the government of the City of Pensacola.

==Airlines and destinations==

===Passenger===


===Cargo operations===
UPS Airlines is the only major cargo carrier at the airport currently. UPS flies two flights into Pensacola, four days out of the week, Tuesday through Friday. On Saturday, UPS only flies one flight to Pensacola. Suburban Air Freight operates daily flights to Atlanta with a Beech 1900C. Ameriflight operated daily feeder flights for UPS to Mobile Downtown Airport and Gulfport–Biloxi International Airport with the Swearingen Fairchild SA227-AT Metro until July 16, 2016. As of July 18, 2016, Martinaire took over feeder service from Ameriflight with the Cessna 208B Super Cargomaster.

<text>The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge ( ; also referred to as the Narrows Bridge, the Verrazzano Bridge, and simply the Verrazzano) is a suspension bridge connecting the boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn in New York City, United States. It spans the Narrows, a body of water linking the relatively enclosed New York Harbor with Lower New York Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only fixed crossing of the Narrows. The double-deck bridge carries 13 lanes of Interstate 278: seven on the upper level and six on the lower level. The span is named for Giovanni da Verrazzano, who in 1524 was the first European explorer to enter New York Harbor and the Hudson River.

Engineer David B. Steinman proposed a bridge across the Narrows in the late 1920s, but plans were deferred over the next twenty years. A 1920s attempt to build a Staten Island Tunnel was aborted, as was a 1930s plan for vehicular tubes underneath the Narrows. Discussion of a tunnel resurfaced in the mid-1930s and early 1940s, but the plans were again denied. In the late 1940s, urban planner Robert Moses championed a bridge across the Narrows as a way to connect Staten Island with the rest of the city. Various problems delayed the start of construction until 1959. Designed by Othmar Ammann, Leopold Just, and other engineers at Ammann &amp; Whitney, the bridge opened on November 21, 1964. The lower deck opened in 1969 to accommodate increasing traffic loads. The bridge was refurbished in the 1990s and again in the 2010s and 2020s.

The bridge has a central span of . It was the longest suspension bridge in the world until it was surpassed by the Humber Bridge in the UK in 1981. The bridge has the 18th-longest main span in the world, as well as the longest in the Americas. When the bridge was officially named in 1960, it was misspelled &quot;Verrazano-Narrows Bridge&quot; due to an error in the construction contract; the name was officially corrected in 2018. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge collects tolls in both directions, although only westbound drivers paid a toll from 1986 to 2020 in an attempt to reduce traffic congestion.

==History==

=== Early plans ===

==== Liberty Bridge ====

A bridge across the Narrows had been proposed as early as 1926 or 1927, when structural engineer David B. Steinman brought up the possibility of such a crossing. At the time, Staten Island was isolated from the rest of New York City, and its only direct connection to the city&#x27;s other four boroughs was by the Staten Island Ferry to South Ferry in Manhattan, or by ferries to 39th and 69th Streets in Brooklyn. In 1928, the chambers of commerce in Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, and Staten Island announced that the Interboro Bridge Company had proposed the future construction of the &quot;Liberty Bridge&quot; to the United States Department of War. The bridge&#x27;s towers would be high and it would cost $60million in 1928 dollars. In November 1929, engineers released plans for the Liberty Bridge spanning the Narrows, with 800-foot-tall towers. Supporters hoped that the new construction would spur development on Staten Island, along with the Outerbridge Crossing and the Bayonne Bridge, which were under construction at the time.

The Liberty Bridge would carry vehicles from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to an as-yet-undetermined location on Staten Island. On the Brooklyn side, the city planned to connect the Liberty Bridge to a &quot;Crosstown Highway&quot;, spanning Brooklyn and Queens and connecting to the proposed Triborough Bridge in northwestern Queens. The city also envisioned a possible connection to the preexisting Manhattan Bridge, connecting Downtown Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan. However, a vote on the planned Liberty Bridge was never taken, as it was blocked by then-Congressman Fiorello H. La Guardia, who believed that a public necessity should not be provided by private interests.

==== 1920s tunnel plan ====
A prior attempt to link Brooklyn and Staten Island, using the Staten Island Tunnel, had commenced in 1923 but was canceled two years later. That tunnel would have extended New York City Subway service from Brooklyn to Staten Island. This proposal was also revived with the announcement of the Liberty Bridge. One of the alternative proposals had the subway tunnel going from St. George, Staten Island, to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, before continuing to Governors Island and then Lower Manhattan. Simultaneously, engineers proposed a set of vehicular tunnels from Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island, to 97th Street, Brooklyn. The tubes were being planned in conjunction with the Triborough Tunnel (the modern-day Queens Midtown Tunnel), which would connect Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. The city appropriated $5million for the tunnels in July 1929, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad also pledged funding for the vehicular tunnels. Planning for the vehicular tubes started that month.

The Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce simultaneously considered all three projects—the bridge, the vehicular tunnels, and the subway tunnel. Community groups on both sides of the Narrows disagreed on which projects should be built first, if at all. Residents of Bay Ridge opposed any plans involving a bridge because its construction would almost definitely require the demolition of part of the neighborhood. Boring work for the vehicular tunnels started in November 1930. The twin tunnels, projected to be completed by 1937, were to connect Hylan Boulevard on Staten Island with 86th Street in Brooklyn once they were completed. In January 1932, construction of these tunnels was put on hold indefinitely due to a lack of money. The construction work did not go beyond an examination of shoreline on the Brooklyn side.

==== Cancellation of bridge ====
In February 1933, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill authorizing the construction of a suspension bridge across the Narrows. With this approval, the Interboro Bridge Company hoped to start constructing the bridge by the end of the year, thereby creating jobs for 80,000 workers. Structural engineer Othmar H. Ammann, who was building the Triborough Bridge, Midtown Tunnel, and Golden Gate Bridge at the time, showed interest in designing the proposed Narrows bridge, which would be the world&#x27;s longest bridge if it were built. The city approved the construction of a rapid transit tunnel under the Narrows in December 1933. This tunnel was approved in conjunction with the proposed Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel connecting Red Hook with Lower Manhattan.

In April 1934, the War Department announced its opposition to the Narrows Bridge&#x27;s construction. The War Department&#x27;s opposition to the bridge plan was based on the fact that a bridge could create a blockage during wartime, a rationale it gave for opposing a Brooklyn–Battery Bridge connecting Red Hook, Brooklyn, with Lower Manhattan. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey did not have a public position regarding the Narrows Bridge plan, other than a request that it be allowed to operate the future bridge. Following the War Department&#x27;s announcement that they would oppose the Narrows bridge, private interests began studying the feasibility of a tunnel under the Narrows.

==== 1930s tunnel plan ====

In 1936, the plan for a Narrows crossing was brought up again when now-New York City mayor La Guardia gained authorization to petition the U.S. Congress for a bridge across the Narrows. Under the new plan, the proposed bridge would charge tolls for motorists, and its $50million cost would be paid off using federal bonds. La Guardia preferred a tunnel instead, and so the next year he requested the New York City Tunnel Authority to review the feasibility of such a crossing. The New York City Planning Commission was amenable to constructing either a bridge or a tunnel across the Narrows, and in 1939, put forth a plan to expand New York City&#x27;s highway system. In March of the same year, as a bill for the Battery Bridge was being passed, Staten Island state legislators added a last-minute amendment to the bill, providing for a Narrows bridge. The Narrows crossing was not included in the final version of the Planning Commission&#x27;s plan, which was approved in 1941.

In 1943, the New York City Board of Estimate allocated $50,000 toward a feasibility study of the tunnel. By this time, Bay Ridge residents now opposed the tunnel plan as well, because they feared that the tunnel&#x27;s construction would lower the quality of life in that neighborhood. After the war ended in 1945, the Planning Commission estimated that construction of the Narrows Tunnel would cost $73.5million. However, by then, La Guardia had turned against the tunnel, saying that &quot;it is not my time&quot; to construct the tunnel.

=== 1940s and 1950s bridge plan ===
==== Initial proposal ====

The cancellation of plans for the Narrows tunnel brought a resurgence of proposals for a bridge across the Narrows. In September 1947, Robert Moses, the chairman of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA), announced that the city was going to ask the War Department for permission to build a bridge across the Narrows. Moses had previously created a feasibility study for a Narrows tunnel, finding that it would be much cheaper to build a bridge. Moses and mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer both supported the Narrows Bridge plan, which was still being referred to as &quot;Liberty Bridge&quot;. The city submitted its request to the War Department in July 1948, and a commission composed of three United States Armed Forces branches was convened to solicit the public&#x27;s opinions on the proposed span.

U.S. Representative Donald Lawrence O&#x27;Toole, whose constituency included Bay Ridge, opposed the proposal for the bridge because he believed it would damage the character of Bay Ridge, and because the bridge might block the Narrows in case of a war. He cited a poll showing that for every Bay Ridge resident who supported the bridge&#x27;s construction, 33 more were opposed. The U.S. military approved the bridge proposal in May 1949, over the vociferous opposition of Bay Ridge residents, on the condition that construction start within five years. By that time, plans for the span had been finalized, and the project only needed $78million in financing in order to proceed. This financing was not set to be awarded until 1950, when the Battery Tunnel was completed. Preliminary plans showed the bridge as being above the mean high water level, enough for the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; to pass under it.

Moses and acting Port Authority Chairman Bayard F. Pope were agreeable to letting either of their respective agencies construct and operate the proposed Narrows Bridge, as long as that agency could do so efficiently. In 1954, the two agencies started conducting a joint study on the logistics of building and constructing the bridge. Because of restrictions by the TBTA&#x27;s bondholders, construction could not begin until at least 1957. Frederick H. Zurmuhlen, the Commissioner of Public Works, estimated that the Narrows Bridge would cost $200million total. He encouraged the TBTA to start construction on the bridge as soon as possible in order to reduce congestion on East River crossings to the north. Staten Islanders viewed the project cautiously, since the Narrows Bridge would provide a connection to the rest of the city, but could also cause traffic congestion through the borough. Moses had only a positive view of the bridge&#x27;s proposed effects on Staten Islanders, saying that it was vital for the borough&#x27;s future.

In May 1954, the Army&#x27;s permit for starting construction on the Narrows Bridge lapsed. The Army granted a two-year extension for the start of construction. In a measure passed in March 1955, the city gained control over the approval process for several tasks related to the Narrows bridge&#x27;s construction, including land acquisition. A little more than a month later, New York governor W. Averell Harriman signed a $600million spending bill authorizing the construction of the Narrows Bridge; the construction of the Throgs Neck Bridge between Queens and the Bronx; and the addition of a second level to the George Washington Bridge between Manhattan and New Jersey. Later that year, it was announced that the Narrows Bridge would be part of an expansion to the Interstate Highway System. Although a study on the viability of adding transit service to the Narrows Bridge was commissioned in early 1956, Moses rejected the idea of adding subway tracks onto the new bridge, saying that it would be too costly. In April of that year, New Jersey governor Robert B. Meyner signed a bill that allowed the Port Authority to build the Narrows Bridge and lease it to the TBTA, who would operate the bridge. The TBTA would buy the bridge from the Port Authority in 1967 as part of the agreement.

==== Finalization of plans ====

On the Brooklyn side, the Narrows Bridge was originally supposed to connect to the Circumferential (Belt) Parkway, but in early 1957, Harriman vetoed a bill that stipulated that the main approach connect to the Belt Parkway. By May 1957, an updated location for the Brooklyn anchorage had been agreed on. The anchorage was now to be located at Fort Lafayette, an island coastal fortification built next to Fort Hamilton at the southern tip of Bay Ridge. Moses also proposed expanding Brooklyn&#x27;s Gowanus Expressway and extending it to the Narrows Bridge by way of Seventh Avenue, which would require cutting through the middle of Bay Ridge. This proposal drew opposition from the community, who wanted the approach to follow the Belt Parkway along the Brooklyn shore. These opponents said that the Seventh Avenue alignment would displace over 1,500 families. In February 1958, the New York State Legislature approved a bill to change the Brooklyn approaches back to Belt Parkway, which was almost identical to the bill Harriman had vetoed. However, the city approved the Seventh Avenue bridge approach in August 1958. The next month, mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. said that the city was committed to building a bridge across the Narrows, but was not committed to the construction of the Seventh Avenue approach. In response, Moses wrote to Wagner that any continuing delays would cause the bridge to be canceled. The bridge&#x27;s cost had now risen to $320million.

After holding a hearing for concerned Bay Ridge residents, the Board of Estimate affirmed the Narrows Bridge plan in October 1958, without any objections. At the same time, it rejected plans for a tunnel under the Narrows, as well as a bridge or tunnel from Brooklyn directly to Jersey City, New Jersey. The Board was set to vote on the Seventh Avenue approach in mid-December, but the federal government stated that it would only agree to the bridge&#x27;s construction if the Seventh Avenue approach had 12 lanes, with six on each level. The federal government was already paying for two highway improvements on both sides of the proposed bridge: the Clove Lakes Expressway (Staten Island Expressway) on Staten Island, and the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn. On December 31 of that year, the Board of Estimate voted to approve plans for the Seventh Avenue approach, having delayed that vote several times.

The approval of the Seventh Avenue approach angered Bay Ridge residents since the construction of the approach would displace 7,500 people. Opposition in Staten Island was far smaller. More than twice as many people were being displaced there, but Staten Island stood to benefit from a better connection to the rest of the city. Thus, the bridge&#x27;s announcement was welcomed and it sparked a rise in real-estate prices on the island. As the controversy progressed, Steinman brought up a competing proposal to build a bridge between Brooklyn and New Jersey directly. Nelson Rockefeller, the Republican candidate for governor of New York, initially supported Steinman&#x27;s proposal to build a bridge to New Jersey, but Moses later persuaded Rockefeller to endorse the bridge to Staten Island.

The State Legislature drafted a bill in an effort to change the Brooklyn approach&#x27;s location to Belt Parkway. However, now-governor Rockefeller vetoed the Belt Parkway bill, and in March 1959, the Board of Estimate officially condemned land along Seventh Avenue to make way for the Gowanus Expressway extension to the Narrows Bridge. The only tasks remaining before the start of construction were to finalize the design of the Narrows Bridge, and to speed up the construction schedule to meet a 1964 deadline. In April 1959, the bridge was officially renamed after the Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano. This sparked a controversy because the proposed bridge&#x27;s name only had one &quot;z&quot; while the explorer&#x27;s name had two &quot;z&quot;s.

=== Construction ===

==== Preparation ====

Surveying work for the -Narrows Bridge began in January 1959. Construction officially began on August 14, 1959, with a groundbreaking ceremony on the Staten Island anchorage. Those in attendance included New Jersey governor Meyner, New York City mayor Wagner, and TBTA chairman Moses. Although Rockefeller had been invited to the event, neither he nor Assembly speaker Joseph F. Carlino showed up. In December 1959, the TBTA was put in charge of funding and building the bridge. To raise money for construction, Rockefeller signed a bill that would remove the 4% ceiling on the interest rates for the securities that the TBTA was selling to pay for the bridge. This ceiling would be lifted until June 1965. In essence, this meant that the TBTA could sell securities at much higher interest rates to raise the $320million that was needed.

Othmar Ammann was named as the senior partner for the project. Other notable figures involved chief engineer Milton Brumer; project engineers Herb Rothman and Frank L. Stahl; design engineer Leopold Just; Safety Engineer Alonzo Dickinson, and engineer of construction John West Kinney. Meanwhile, John &quot;Hard Nose&quot; Murphy supervised the span&#x27;s and cables&#x27; construction.

Before starting actual work on the bridge, the TBTA destroyed the structures at the future locations of the anchorages. The agency acquired of the within Fort Hamilton, in return for paying for a $12million renovation of the Army installation and giving up of land in Dyker Beach Park. A 1,000-ton World War I monument on the Brooklyn side, within the path of the future Seventh Avenue approach, was placed atop rolling logs and shifted . The right-of-way for the Seventh Avenue approach was also being cleared, and despite initial opposition to the clearing work, all of the residents within the approach&#x27;s path eventually acquiesced to moving elsewhere. To prevent contractors from delaying work on the expressways on either side of the bridge, Moses warned them of steep fines if the expressways were not completed by the time the bridge was finished.

==== Progress ====

An anchorage was built on each side of the Narrows, with each anchorage measuring long by wide, and containing a combined of steel and concrete. Each anchorage contained sixty-six large holes for the cables. The bases of each anchorage are built on glacial sands, reaching below ground level on the Brooklyn side, and below ground level on the Staten Island side. Foundation work for the -Narrows Bridge was well underway by 1960, as visitors were able to see the anchorages. A concrete workers&#x27; strike in mid-1961 threatened the timely completion of the Staten Island anchorage, which had only been partially filled with concrete. This strike lasted several months and affected many projects under the city.

As construction on the anchorages proceeded, two watertight caissons were sunk into the channel close to either shoreline, so that the bridge&#x27;s suspension towers could be built atop each caisson. The bases of each caisson consisted of sixty-six circular openings each in diameter, arranged in a six-by-eleven grid. Shafts of reinforced concrete would be built along the inner rim of each opening, and once each section of shaft reached above water level, cranes with clamshell buckets would dig the sand and mud inside each shaft before sinking the shafts deeper into the water. The Staten Island side&#x27;s caisson was sunk into the water, and necessitated the dredging of of sand and assorted muck. This caisson required of concrete, and in March 1961, it became the first of the two caissons to be sunk. The Brooklyn side&#x27;s caisson required even more work, since it was deep, displaced of muck, and used of concrete. Once the caissons were sunk completely, the shafts inside each caisson were filled with water, and the bases of the caissons were covered by a sheet of reinforced concrete. The process of constructing the anchorages and caissons took just over two years, and it was complete by the end of 1961.

Two separate companies later constructed the modules that would make up the suspension towers. The Staten Island tower was built by Bethlehem Steel, and the Brooklyn tower was built by the Harris Structural Company. The first piece of the towers, a 300-foot piece of the tower on the Staten Island side, was lifted into place in October 1961, and this tower was topped out by September 1962. The Brooklyn tower started construction in April 1962. When the towers were fully erected, workers began the process of spinning the bridge&#x27;s cables. The American Bridge Company was selected to construct the cables and deck. The cable-spinning process began in March 1963, and took six months, since of bridge cables had to be strung 104,432 times around the bridge. The main cables were hung on both sides of the span, and then suspender cables were hung from the bridge&#x27;s main cables. The main cables were fully spun by August.

In late 1963, builders started receiving the rectangular pieces that would make up the roadway deck. The components for the sixty 40-ton slabs were first created in an assembly line in Jersey City. Then, these components were combined in a Bayonne steelworks from the bridge site, and after the pieces of each slab were assembled, they were floated to the Narrows via barge. Each piece measured high by approximately wide and long. These pieces of the deck were then hung from the suspender cables. The first piece of the deck was lifted onto the bridge in October 1963. By early 1964, the span was nearly finished, and all that remained was to secure the various parts of the bridge. By this point, plans for new development on Staten Island were well underway, and tourists had come to observe the construction of the -Narrows Bridge. The bridge had been scheduled to open in 1965, but as a result of the faster-than-anticipated rate of progress, the TBTA decided to open the bridge in November 1964. In preparation for the -Narrows Bridge&#x27;s opening, the TBTA fully repainted the structure. The construction process of the bridge had employed an average of 1,200 workers a day for five years, excluding those who had worked on the approaches; around 10,000 individuals had worked on the bridge throughout that five-year period.

Three men died during the construction of the bridge. The first fatality was 58-year-old Paul Bassett, who fell off the deck and struck a tower in August 1962. Irving Rubin, also 58 years old, died in July 1963, when he fell off of the bridge approach. The third worker who died was 19-year-old Gerard McKee, who fell into the water in October 1963, after slipping off the catwalk. After McKee&#x27;s death, workers participated in a five-day strike in December 1963. The strike resulted in temporary safety nets being installed underneath the deck. These nets had not been provided during the four years prior to the strike.

The construction of the bridge was chronicled by the writer Gay Talese in his 1964 book &quot;The Bridge: The Building of the -Narrows Bridge&quot;. He also wrote several articles about the bridge&#x27;s construction for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The book also contains several drawings by Lili Réthi and photographs by Bruce Davidson.

===Opening===

The Staten Island approach to the -Narrows Bridge was the first part of the new project to be completed, and it opened in January 1964. The upper deck was opened on November 21, 1964, at a cost of $320 million (equivalent to $ billion in present dollars). Politicians at all levels of the government, from Brooklyn Borough President Abe Stark to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, wrote speeches paying tribute to the -Narrows Bridge. The opening ceremony was attended by over 5,000 people, including 1,500 official guests. Several dignitaries, involving the mayor, the governor, and the borough presidents of Brooklyn and Staten Island, cut the gold ribbon. They then joined a motorcade to mark the official opening of the bridge. A 50-cent toll was charged to all motorists crossing the bridge. The Bridge&#x27;s opening was celebrated across Staten Island. Moses did not invite any of the 12,000 workers to the opening, so they boycotted the event and instead attended a mass in memory of the three workers who died during construction.

The opening was accompanied by the release of a commemorative postage stamp, which depicted a ship sailing underneath the new span. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) created a bus route across the bridge to connect Victory Boulevard in Staten Island with the Bay Ridge–95th Street subway station in Brooklyn. This bus service initially saw low patronage, with only 6,000 daily passengers using the route. Five days after the -Narrows Bridge opened, the ferry from Staten Island to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, stopped running, as it was now redundant to the new bridge.

Within the first two months of the bridge&#x27;s opening, 1.86million vehicles had used the new crossing, 10% more than originally projected, and this netted the TBTA almost $1million in toll revenue. The Goethals Bridge, which connected New Jersey to the Staten Island Expressway and the Bridge, saw its daily average use increase by 75%, or approximately 300,000 trips total, compared to before the Narrows Bridge opened. The Holland Tunnel from New Jersey to Manhattan, and the Staten Island Ferry from Staten Island to Manhattan, both saw decreased vehicle counts after the bridge opened. In summer 1965, Staten Island saw increased patronage at its beaches, facilitated by the opening of the new bridge. By the time of the bridge&#x27;s first anniversary, 17million motorists had crossed the -Narrows Bridge, paying $9million in tolls. The bridge had seen 34% more trips than planners had projected. Conversely, 5.5million fewer passengers and 700,000 fewer vehicles rode the Staten Island Ferry to Manhattan.

The Bridge was the last project designed by Ammann, who had designed many of the other major crossings into and within New York City. He died in 1965, the year after the bridge opened. The -Narrows Bridge was also the last great public works project in New York City overseen by Moses. The urban planner envisioned that the and Throgs Neck Bridges would be the final major bridges in New York City for the time being, since they would complete the city&#x27;s expressway system.

===Late 1960s to 2000s===
Although the bridge was constructed with only one six-lane roadway, Ammann had provided extra trusses to support a potential second roadway underneath the main deck. These trusses, which were used to strengthen the bridge, were a design alteration that was added to many bridges in the aftermath of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse in 1940. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge became so popular among motorists that in March 1969, the TBTA decided to erect the lower deck at a cost of $22million. The Verrazzano Bridge had not been expected to carry enough traffic to necessitate a second deck until 1978, but traffic patterns over the previous five years had demonstrated the need for extra capacity. By contrast, a lower deck on the George Washington Bridge, connecting New Jersey and Upper Manhattan, had not been built until 31 years after the bridge&#x27;s 1931 opening. The new six-lane deck opened on June 28, 1969. Originally, the Verrazzano Bridge&#x27;s Brooklyn end was also supposed to connect to the planned Cross-Brooklyn Expressway, New York State Route 878, and JFK Airport, but the Cross-Brooklyn Expressway project was canceled in 1969.

On June 26, 1976, to celebrate the United States&#x27; 200th anniversary, workers placed a very large U.S. flag on the side of the Verrazzano Bridge. The flag, which measured , was described in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as being the size of &quot;a football field and a half&quot; and billed as the world&#x27;s largest flag. At the time, it was the largest U.S. flag ever made. The flag was supposed to withstand wind speeds of , but it ripped apart three days later, when there was a wind speed of . The flag had been stuck against the bridge&#x27;s suspender cables, so any slight wind would have caused the cables to make tears in the flag. A second flag was created in 1980 for the July 4 celebration that year. This flag was even larger at (an area of ). The new flag was placed along a steel grid so that the suspender cables would not rip it apart. Architectural critic Ada Louise Huxtable derided the new flag as a &quot;simple-minded, vainglorious proposal&quot; and asked, &quot;Does anyone really want to spend $850,000 to upstage the Statue of Liberty?&quot;

The TBTA stopped collecting tolls for Brooklyn-bound drivers on the Verrazzano Bridge in 1986 and doubled the toll for Staten Island-bound drivers. This was a result of a bill introduced by Guy V. Molinari, the U.S. representative for Staten Island, as part of an initiative to reduce traffic that accumulated at the toll booth on Staten Island. The one-way toll was initially intended to be part of a six-month pilot program, but resulted in permanent changes to traffic flows on the Verrazzano Bridge. The crossing saw more Brooklyn-bound traffic and less Staten Island-bound traffic as a result. This unidirectional collection remained in effect through 2020, when two-way tolls were restored.

The TBTA spent $45 million in the 1990s on repairs to the deck, which had been damaged by chloride from the seawater. As part of the project, the top of the deck was removed and latex-modified concrete poured in its place. The TBTA also allocated $30 million to repaint the bridge and approaches gray; this project began in 1998. Workers also repaired the bridge&#x27;s anchorages and replaced the roadways atop the anchorages. The repairs to the anchorages and electrical systems were completed in 2002, and workers finished repainting the bridge the next year. In addition, a minor project to clean and repaint both of the decks (mostly the bottom deck) took place between 2004 and 2008. Beginning in 2008, all 262 of the mercury vapor fixtures in the bridge&#x27;s necklace lighting were replaced with energy-efficient light-emitting diodes. This retrofit was completed in 2009, years before LED street lights were installed in the rest of the city.

The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge&#x27;s name was originally spelled with one &quot;z&quot;. The &quot;&quot; name dates to 1960 when governor Rockefeller had signed the bill authorizing the bridge&#x27;s name as such. A bill to formally change the bridge&#x27;s name to the variant with two &quot;z&quot;s was introduced by college student Robert Nash in 2016, but it stalled in early 2018. The New York State Senate voted to change the name of the bridge in June 2018, and the name change was officially signed into law that October.

===2010s to present===

In 2011, the city began a $1.5billion construction project at the bridge. At the time, it was expected to take up to 25 years. The first phase, which cost $235million and lasted until 2017, involved constructing a seventh lane on the upper deck, which was to be used as a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane. The old median barrier was demolished, and the old deck was replaced with orthotropic decking. Related work also included the repainting the bridge&#x27;s supports with corrosion-resistant paint. The ramps within the Belt Parkway interchange were also rearranged to allow for a ramp to be constructed for the new HOV lane on the upper deck. The parts for this deck were ordered from China because the parts that the MTA required were no longer manufactured in the United States. After the upper deck was replaced, parts of the lower deck are to be replaced, but this necessitates the closure of the lower deck during construction. Hence, the MTA opted to replace the upper deck first to add more capacity. The upper level&#x27;s new HOV lane opened on June 22, 2017. The MTA dismantled the Staten Island-bound toll booths in 2017 to speed up westbound traffic. This work was done in advance of the reconstruction of tracks around Penn Station, which severely limited rail service into that station and created more vehicular traffic at crossings to Manhattan. The MTA accelerated some components of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge&#x27;s reconstruction during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City in 2020, rebuilding the westbound approach ramp from the Gowanus Expressway and adding a fourth lane along that ramp. This also allowed for an extensive renovation of the towers&#x27; pedestals. Long-term plans also call for the installation of a bicycle and pedestrian path on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge.

==Description==

The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge is owned by Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority bondholders who paid for the bridge at its construction. It is operated by the TBTA, which is an affiliate agency of the MTA, using the business name MTA Bridges and Tunnels. The bridge carries Interstate 278, which continues onto the Staten Island Expressway to the west and the Gowanus Expressway to the northeast. The Verrazzano, in combination with the Goethals Bridge and the Staten Island Expressway, created a new way for commuters and travelers to reach Brooklyn, Long Island, and Manhattan by car from New Jersey.

===Deck===
At the time of opening, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge was the longest suspension bridge in the world; its 4,260-foot center span, between the two suspension towers, was longer than the Golden Gate Bridge&#x27;s center span. Despite being only slightly longer than the Golden Gate Bridge, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge could carry a 75% greater load than the former could. In 1981, the Verrazzano Bridge was surpassed by the Humber Bridge in England, which has a center span of , as the world&#x27;s longest suspension bridge.

The upper and lower levels are supported by trusses underneath each roadway, which stiffen the bridge against vertical, torsional, and lateral pressure. There are also lateral trusses on either side of the lower level. The anchorage on the Staten Island side contains a facility for heating cinders that are used to de-ice the bridge deck during winter.

Because of thermal expansion of the steel cables, the height of the upper roadway is lower in summer than in winter. The Narrows is the only entry point for large cruise ships and container ships that dock in New York City. As a result, they must be built to accommodate the clearance under the bridge. At mean high water, that clearance is . The RMS &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;, one such vessel built to Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge specifications, was designed with a flatter funnel to pass under the bridge, and has of clearance under the bridge during high tide.

===Towers and cables===
Each of the two suspension towers contains around 1 million bolts and 3 million rivets. The towers contain a combined of metal, more than three times the of metal used in the Empire State Building. Because of the height of the towers () and their distance from each other (), the curvature of the Earth&#x27;s surface had to be taken into account when designing the bridge. The towers are not parallel to each other, but are farther apart at their tops than at their bases. When built, the bridge&#x27;s suspension towers were the tallest structures in New York City outside of Manhattan. The towers do not use cross-bracing, unlike similar suspension bridges; instead, there are arched struts near the top of each tower and below the lower deck. At the base of each tower is a concrete-and-granite pedestal, which rests on a caisson measuring across.

The western tower is offshore from Staten Island, while the eastern tower is offshore from Brooklyn. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge is classified as a fracture critical bridge, making it vulnerable to collapse if parts of the offshore towers were to fail. The March 2024 collapse of Baltimore&#x27;s Key Bridge raised awareness and concern about other bridges nationwide, especially with ship traffic being diverted to other area ports. A few weeks after the Baltimore bridge collapse, a large container ship had propulsion problems near the Verrazzano in early April and was assisted by several tugboats. Authorities were confident that riprap, or piles of rocks, around the towers&#x27; bases would ground a stray ship before it could hit a tower.

The diameter of each of the four main suspension cables is . Each main cable is composed of 26,108 wires amounting to a total of in length.

Numerous birds nest or roost on the bridge, most notably breeding peregrine falcons. The falcons nest at the top of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge&#x27;s towers, as well as on the Throgs Neck and Marine Parkway Bridges. As the falcons are endangered, the city places bands on each bird and examines the birds&#x27; nesting sites each year. The falcons were discovered on the top of the Verrazzano Bridge in 1983, though they had started breeding there several years prior.

== Naming ==
=== Tentative names ===

During the planning stages, the bridge was originally named simply the &quot;Narrows Bridge&quot;. The co-naming of the bridge for Verrazzano (with two &quot;z&quot;s) was controversial. It was first proposed in 1951 by the Italian Historical Society of America when the bridge was in the planning stage. After Robert Moses turned down the initial proposal, the society undertook a public relations campaign to re-establish Giovanni da Verrazzano&#x27;s largely forgotten reputation and to promote the idea of naming the bridge for him. The society&#x27;s director, John N. LaCorte, successfully lobbied several governors of states along the U.S.&#x27;s East Coast to proclaim April 17, the anniversary of Verrazzano&#x27;s arrival in the harbor, as Verrazzano Day. LaCorte then approached the TBTA again but was turned down a second time. The explorer&#x27;s name had previously been suggested for the George Washington Bridge, located several miles north, in 1931.

The Italian Historical Society later successfully lobbied to get a bill introduced in the New York State Assembly to name the bridge for the explorer. After the introduction of the bill, the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce joined the society in promoting the name. In April 1958, governor W. Averell Harriman announced that he would propose naming the Narrows Bridge after Verrazzano in honor of the explorer&#x27;s voyage to New York Harbor in 1524. His successor, Nelson Rockefeller, put his support behind the one-&quot;z&quot; &quot;&quot; name in April 1959, saying that it was the Americans&#x27; standard way of spelling the explorer&#x27;s name. According to Gay Talese, the one-&quot;z&quot; name was bolstered by the fact that it appeared on the bridge&#x27;s first construction contracts in 1959; this incorrect spelling persisted in all subsequent references to the bridge.

Although the &quot;&quot; name was not finalized yet, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that the Staten Island Ferry boat carrying dignitaries to the bridge&#x27;s August 1959 groundbreaking ceremony was named the &quot;Verrazzano&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; further stated that Harriman and mayor Wagner had respectively proposed a &quot;Verrazzano Bridge&quot; and proclaimed a &quot;Verrazzano Day&quot;. The Staten Island Chamber of Commerce opposed the Verrazzano name altogether, saying that the proper name of the bridge should be &quot;Staten Island Bridge&quot; because there was also a &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot;, a &quot;Manhattan Bridge&quot;, a &quot;Queens Bridge&quot;, and a &quot;Bronx Bridge&quot;. The Italian Historical Society was reportedly perplexed about the opposition to the &quot; name. In response to the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s opposition, the TBTA offered to add a hyphen between &quot; and &quot;Narrows&quot;.

=== Official name with one &quot;z&quot; ===
Rockefeller signed the &quot;&quot; name into law in March 1960, which officially changed the name of the Narrows Bridge to &quot;-Narrows Bridge&quot;. The naming issue did not encounter further controversy until 1963, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This prompted a series of suggestions to rename structures, monuments, and agencies across the United States after the late president. A petition to rename the Bridge for Kennedy received thousands of signatures. In response, LaCorte contacted the president&#x27;s brother, United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who told LaCorte that he would assure that the bridge would keep the &quot;&quot; name. Ultimately, the -Narrows Bridge kept its name, while Idlewild Airport in Queens was renamed after Kennedy.

In part due to discrimination against Italian-Americans, the bridge&#x27;s official name was widely ignored by local news outlets at the time of the dedication. Some radio announcers and newspapers omitted any reference to Verrazzano, referring to the bridge as the Narrows Bridge, or the Brooklyn–Staten Island Bridge. The society continued its lobbying efforts to promote the name in the following years until the name became firmly established. Another ethnic slur for the bridge was its nickname as the &quot;Guinea Gangplank&quot;, referring to the Italian-Americans who subsequently moved from Brooklyn to Staten Island. The Italian Historical Society&#x27;s published references to the bridge&#x27;s name all contained two &quot;z&quot;s.

=== Bills to change bridge&#x27;s name ===

In June 2016, St. Francis College student Robert Nash started a petition to spell Giovanni da Verrazzano&#x27;s name on the bridge correctly, with two &quot;z&quot;s. The petition gained support from politicians including New York state senators Martin Golden and Andrew Lanza. In December 2016, Golden and Lanza sent letters to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority CEO Thomas F. Prendergast, in which they recommended that the bridge&#x27;s name be spelled correctly. An MTA spokesperson said the agency was reviewing the letter.

A bill to formally change the bridge&#x27;s name passed the New York State Senate in 2017 before being defeated in the New York State Assembly in early 2018. In mid-2018, Golden sponsored a State Senate bill to change the bridge&#x27;s spelling to &quot;Verrazzano&quot; with two &quot;z&quot;s. On June 6 of that year, the Senate unanimously passed a bill to change the spelling of the -Narrows Bridge, sending the measure to the New York State Assembly and the office of New York governor Andrew Cuomo for approval. If the bill was passed, the MTA would modify nearly a hundred road signs at a cost of $350,000. The Assembly passed the bill on June 21, sending the measure to Cuomo with a minor modification. As a cost-saving measure, existing signs would retain the one-&quot;z&quot; spelling, and only new signs would contain the double-&quot;z&quot; spelling. On October 1, 2018, Cuomo signed the bill into law, effectively changing the legal spelling of the bridge to the &quot;Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge&quot;. The first signs with the corrected spelling were installed in February 2020.

==Tolls==

, drivers pay $11.19 per car or $4.71 per motorcycle for tolls by mail/non-NYCSC E-Z Pass. E-ZPass users with transponders issued by the New York E‑ZPass Customer Service Center pay $6.94 per car or $3.02 per motorcycle. Mid-Tier NYCSC E-Z Pass users pay $8.36 per car or $3.57 per motorcycle. All E-ZPass users with transponders not issued by the New York E-ZPass CSC will be required to pay Toll-by-mail rates.

The Staten Island Resident Rebate Program provides a discounted rate of $2.75 to registered residents of Staten Island who use E-ZPass. In the event that the Resident Rebate Program is discontinued, the effective toll for Staten Island residents with E-ZPasses would be set at $3.68. Until April 2021, Staten Island residents could request an E-ZPass Flex; when three or more people were in a passenger vehicle, they could travel at a reduced rate of $1.70. Non-residents do not get the rebated or discounted rates. A bill that passed in the New York State Senate in May 2019 would give the discounted rate to Brooklyn residents with E-ZPass who cross at least 10 times per month. The discount would only apply to non-commercial vehicles.

Prior to the implementation of two-way tolling, the undiscounted tolls for passenger cars were higher than for most other tolled crossings in the U.S. The tolls from the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge grossed the MTA $417million in 2017, and more than 85 percent of motorists paid a discounted toll rate.

===One-way toll===
An urban legend has it that tolls were to be abolished once the bridge&#x27;s construction bonds were paid off, but this has been debunked by the &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot;. Originally, all drivers paid the same toll to cross the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. Staten Island residents were the only residents of New York City who had to pay a toll in order to enter their home borough, since all four of Staten Island&#x27;s vehicular crossings collected tolls. This put Staten Island motorists at a financial disadvantage compared with drivers who lived in other boroughs. A bill to reduce the tolls for Staten Islanders was introduced in the New York City Council in 1975. Governor Mario Cuomo signed another law to give Staten Island residents discounted tolls in 1983, after years of petitioning and opposition from his two predecessors.

From its opening until 1986, the toll was collected in both directions. In 1985, U.S. Representative Guy V. Molinari co-sponsored a bill that would require the MTA to collect the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge&#x27;s toll in the Staten Island-bound direction only. This came after Staten Island residents had complained about pollution from idling vehicles. In December of that year, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill that prohibited the MTA from collecting tolls from Brooklyn-bound vehicles, under penalty of a loss of highway funding. Accordingly, in March 1986, the MTA started a pilot program where it charged a $3.50 toll for Staten Island-bound vehicles rather than charging a $1.75 toll in both directions. The pilot program was extended to six months, but it was controversial due to the dubious benefits involved. The new toll plan not only caused a drop in revenues, but also caused congestion in Manhattan and Brooklyn and air pollution in Manhattan. Canal Street in Lower Manhattan, which connected to the Holland Tunnel to New Jersey, saw the most severe congestion, as drivers would go through New Jersey and use the Bayonne Bridge to pay a cheaper toll to enter Staten Island. Fatal accidents involving pedestrians in Lower Manhattan also increased greatly as a result.

In 1987, the MTA supported removing the one-way toll because it reduced MTA revenues by $7million a year. At that point, Cuomo proposed reinstating an eastbound toll for trucks. In 1990, it was noted that about 455,000 more eastbound vehicles per year were using the bridge&#x27;s eastbound lanes compared with before the toll reconfiguration, but that this was heavily outweighed by the 1.5million fewer westbound vehicles per year. Residents of Manhattan and Brooklyn wanted the tolls changed so that either eastbound vehicles only, or both directions, would be tolled.

In 2019, the United States House of Representatives voted in favor of a federal appropriations bill, which would repeal the bridge&#x27;s one-way-toll mandate and allow half of the then-current toll to be applied to both directions. At the time, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge was the only American bridge with a federal mandate controlling its toll collections. President Donald Trump signed the bill in December 2019, but the MTA had yet to determine at that time when it would enact two-way tolls. After the mandate was repealed, the MTA had to seek approval for split tolls from its board, and install tolling gantries to support split tolls. On December 1, 2020, two-way tolls were reinstated.

===Electronic tolling and tollbooth removals===

E-ZPass was introduced at the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in late 1995. Its introduction helped to reduce traffic congestion at the tollbooths; in March 1997, it was found that drivers with E-ZPass were able to pass through the westbound tollbooths within 30 seconds, compared to 15 minutes for drivers paying with tokens or cash. In February 1998, the MTA discontinued the sale of toll tokens on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, except to Staten Island residents purchasing them in bulk.

Despite not collecting tolls in the eastbound direction since 1986, the MTA did not do anything with the unused booths for a quarter-century. In 2010, eight of the eleven Brooklyn-bound toll booths were removed as part of the first phase of a project to improve traffic flow at the toll plaza. Two years later, the last of the eastbound tollbooths was removed. Until 2020, tolls were still collected in the Staten Island-bound direction only, and congestion within Lower Manhattan persisted due to the bridge&#x27;s one-way westbound toll.

Open-road cashless tolling began on July 8, 2017. The westbound tollbooths were also dismantled, and drivers were no longer able to pay cash at the bridge. Instead, cameras and E-ZPass readers are mounted on new overhead gantries manufactured by TransCore near where the booths were located. A vehicle without E-ZPass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll is mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly.

===Historical tolls===
==Bridge usage==

In 2015, an average of 202,523 vehicles used the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge daily in both directions. , the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge carries more traffic than the Outerbridge Crossing, the Bayonne Bridge, and the Goethals Bridge combined. These three bridges, which connect Staten Island with New Jersey, were used by a combined 168,984 vehicles in both directions.

In 2011, advocacy group Transportation for America rated the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge as New York&#x27;s most dangerous, because of the combination of deterioration and the number of people who cross it per day. The MTA responded that the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, which was both the newest large bridge and the longest bridge in the state, was structurally sound, and that the bridge had passed its most recent inspection. The MTA attributed Transportation for America&#x27;s results to a &quot;misinterpretation of inspection records&quot;.

Signs at both ends of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge forbid photography and videotaping while on the bridge. These signs were installed after the September 11, 2001, attacks, when the MTA started confiscating film from individuals who were caught filming MTA crossings. However, the ban had been in place long before the attacks in order to prevent people from taking close-up pictures of the bridge.

=== Public transportation ===
Three local bus routes operated by MTA Regional Bus Operations use the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge: the S53 local route, the S79 Select Bus Service route, and the S93 limited-stop route. The bridge also carries 20 express bus routes that connect Staten Island with Manhattan and are also operated by New York City Transit. They are the SIM1, SIM1C, SIM2, SIM3, SIM3C, SIM4, SIM4C, SIM4X, SIM5, SIM6, SIM7, SIM9, SIM10, SIM15, SIM31, SIM32, SIM33, SIM33C, SIM34, and SIM35.

As part of a proposed expansion of the New York City Subway, a subway line on the bridge was considered early in the planning process, but Moses rejected the plan, ostensibly over cost concerns. Other bridges proposed and built by Moses, including the Triborough Bridge, Henry Hudson Bridge, Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, and Throgs Neck Bridge, also lack provisions for subway tracks. According to biographer Robert Caro, Moses purposely excluded any provisions for mass transit on his bridges to promote private transportation.

=== Pedestrian and bicycle access ===
==== Lack of walkway or bikeway ====
The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge was not built with a pedestrian walkway. At the time, it was seen as too expensive, and planners additionally explained the lack of a walkway as a benefit that would help prevent suicide jumps. Non-motorized transportation occurs only if the bridge is closed to regular traffic, such as during the New York City Marathon and the Five Boro Bike Tour. In 1976, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge was designated as the starting point of the New York City Marathon. The 1976 marathon was the first year in the marathon&#x27;s six-year history that its course went outside Manhattan. Since then, the marathon has started at the bridge&#x27;s Staten Island end every year. The bridge is entirely closed whenever the marathon takes place, and it is partially closed during the bike tours. Originally, the organizers of these events used the bridge free of charge; in the 2020s, the MTA began requesting that the events&#x27; organizers pay a fee to compensate for the loss of toll revenue. The MTA ultimately dropped its request that the marathon reimburse the agency for lost toll revenue.

The lack of a walkway did not completely prevent suicides, since by 1975, four people had died after jumping off the bridge. The number of suicides has increased over time, despite efforts at deterrence. A sign that says &quot;Life Is Worth Living&quot; is located on the Staten Island approach. In 2008, the MTA also installed six suicide hotlines on the bridge. In December 2019, the MTA began installing a prototype suicide barrier after a series of fatal jumps from the bridge. A permanent suicide barrier was installed from 2021 to 2022.

====Proposals for pedestrian and bike access====
There have been calls for a walkway or bike lane on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge since its opening, when several people protested over the lack of bike lanes at the bridge&#x27;s opening ceremony. In 1977, as a temporary solution, the city modified three buses to fit 12 bikes and 20 passengers each, then operated these buses on a new &quot;S7 Bridge&quot; route. In 1993, the New York City Department of City Planning called for a footpath across the bridge as part of their Greenway Plan for New York City. The next year, the city sought a $100,000 federal grant to fund a feasibility study into a Verrazzano Bridge pedestrian and bike path. In 1997, the DCP released its study, which found that two footpaths running between the suspender ropes along the upper level, separated for pedestrian and cyclist use, would cost a minimum of $26.5million. The MTA at the time expressed concern about the &quot;safety and liability inherent in any strategy that introduces pedestrian and bicycle access&quot; to the bridge.

Local residents on both sides of the bridge started advocating for the construction of a walkway or bikeway on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in 2002. Dave Lutz, the director of the Neighborhood Open Space Coalition nonprofit, stated that after the September 11 attacks, Staten Islanders walked home along the bridge&#x27;s roadway. Mayor Michael Bloomberg promised to look into the possibility in October 2003.

The Harbor Ring Committee was formed in 2011 to advocate for the completion of the Harbor Ring route, which would create a ring around New York Harbor, including a footpath across the Verrazzano. In spring 2013 the committee began an online petition that generated more than 2,500 signatures, as well as an organizational sign-on letter with the support of 16 regional and local advocacy and planning organizations. That year, the MTA announced that it would conduct a three-year feasibility study for installing a pathway on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. The MTA considered plans for a bike lane in 2015, during the reconstruction of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. The MTA estimated that a dedicated multiple-use pathway would cost $400 million due to the need for a minimum width to accommodate a fire engine and construction of entrance and exit ramps. The plan was ultimately rejected in March 2019 over safety concerns.

<text>Southwest Florida International Airport is a major county-owned airport in the South Fort Myers area of unincorporated Lee County, Florida, United States. The airport serves the Southwest Florida region, including the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Naples-Marco Island, and Punta Gorda metropolitan areas, and is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection port of entry. It currently is the second-busiest single-runway airport in the United States, after San Diego International Airport, California. In 2024, the airport served 11,028,182 passengers, the most in its history.

The airport sits on 13,555 acres (5,486 ha, 21.2 sq.mi.) of land just southeast of Fort Myers, making it the third-largest airport in the United States in terms of land size (after Denver and Dallas/Fort Worth). 6,000 acres of the land has been conserved as swamp lands and set aside for environmental mitigation.

==History==
Prior to the opening of the airport, the region was served by Page Field in Fort Myers. By the 1970s, however, it had become clear that Page Field would be too small to handle increasing future demand for commercial flights into the region. Expanding Page Field was determined to be impractical because its airfield was constrained by U.S. 41 to the west and expanding the airfield to the east would require bridging the Ten Mile Canal and relocating a railroad track.

A number of sites were considered for a new regional airport, including southern Charlotte County, Estero, and northeast Cape Coral near Burnt Store Marina. The government of Lee County ultimately selected a site near the end of Daniels Parkway which was a dirt road at the time. An advantage to this location was its proximity to Interstate 75, which was under construction and would have an interchange with Daniels Parkway, providing easy access (Interstate 75 was opened to traffic through Fort Myers in 1979).

Construction of the airport began in 1980 and it opened on schedule on May 14, 1983. Upon opening, the airport was named Southwest Florida Regional Airport (the airport code RSW is short for &quot;Regional South-West&quot;). Originally, the airport included a single 8400-ft runway and a passenger terminal with 14 gates on two concourses. The original 1983 terminal was located on the north side of the runway at the end of Chamberlin Parkway. 

When the airport opened in 1983, Southwest Florida Regional Airport was served by Air Florida Commuter (operated by Finair Express), Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, Northwest Orient Airlines, Ozark Air Lines, Pan Am, Republic Airlines, and United Airlines. Delta Air Lines operated the first flight. By 1985, American Airlines, People Express, Provincetown-Boston Airlines, Southern Express, and USAir were also serving the airport.

In 1986, American Trans Air (later known as ATA) began service to Fort Myers with flights to Indianapolis International Airport, which was the first scheduled service for that airline.

The airport was renamed Southwest Florida International Airport in 1993, though it had hosted international flights since 1984 and U.S. Customs since 1987. The name change coincided with the completion of a 55,000 square foot Federal Inspection facility annexed to the original terminal&#x27;s Concourse A. The runway was also lengthened to 12,000 ft (3,658 m) at the same time to better accommodate international service (making it the fourth-longest runway in Florida).

In 1988 the airport exceeded its annual capacity of 3 million passengers; by 2004, the airport was serving nearly 7 million passengers annually. In 1998, the original terminal was expanded with a new wing added to Concourse B which included three additional gates, bringing the total to 17.

In April 1994, LTU International introduced the following route: Munich–Düsseldorf–Fort Myers–Miami–Düsseldorf–Munich. This was Fort Myers&#x27; first flight to Europe. It came in response to rising tourism from Germany, which Lee County had spent the past several years cultivating. The county considered Germany a natural market to target, given the sizable German-American community that lived in Southwest Florida and maintained ties with its country of origin.

With the original terminal operating at more than double its intended capacity, construction of a new Midfield Terminal Complex began in February 2002. The $438 million terminal opened on September 9, 2005. The terminal has three concourses and 28 gates. Demolition of the original terminal north of the airfield was completed in spring 2006. However, the original terminal&#x27;s parking lot still stands at the end of Chamberlin Parkway. The former terminal&#x27;s ramp, now known as North Ramp, is now primarily used as a base for Western Global Airlines, an Estero-based cargo airline. In early 2015, Terminal Access Road, the airport&#x27;s main entrance road, was extended past Treeline Avenue to connect directly to Interstate 75, allowing airport-related traffic to avoid local streets. The airport can now be accessed directly from the freeway at Exit 128. Terminal Access Road was then expanded to six lanes in late 2016. 

Air Berlin, which had bought LTU, ceased service to Düsseldorf in October 2017. The following May, Eurowings began routes to Düsseldorf, Munich, and Cologne using Airbus A330s. The carrier subsequently dropped the flights to Munich and Cologne. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company suspended its link to Düsseldorf in March 2020. Eurowings Discover launched a route to Frankfurt in March 2022.

==Current and future projects==
A new $16 million Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting facility (Lee County Station 92) opened in July 2013. A parallel runway is in planning. The project includes a relocated air traffic control tower, apron expansion, crossfield taxiway system, mitigation activities and FPL electrical line relocation. The new air traffic control tower was expected to be completed by 2019, but the construction was delayed until its completion in December 2021 and opened in January of 2022. However, the parallel runway was delayed indefinitely. The apron expansion and crossfield taxiway system were completed in late 2013. The entire project is estimated to cost $454 million.

In early 2018, the Lee County Port Authority (LCPA) announced plans to ease seasonal security wait times by consolidating the three individual concourse checkpoints to a single consolidated checkpoint for all concourses. By relocating the checkpoints, there will be more restaurants, shops, and post-security spaces. According to the announcement by the LCPA, this expansion could cost between $150 million – $180 million. Construction of this expansion is currently underway. The airport is also planning to build another concourse (Concourse E) on the west side of the terminal by 2027.

Plans are in place for Skyplex – a commercial and industrial park in the location of the former passenger terminal. Chamberlin Parkway is currently being realigned which will remove the roadway loop that once served the former terminal.
Other airport-related businesses, such as a hotel, are in the planning stages. A retail gasoline outlet near the airport&#x27;s entrance opened in June 2014.

<doc id="287531" wikidata="Q272714" url="?curid=287531" title="Gallstone">
<text>A gallstone is a stone formed within the gallbladder from precipitated bile components. The term cholelithiasis may refer to the presence of gallstones or to any disease caused by gallstones, and choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of migrated gallstones within bile ducts.

Most people with gallstones (about 80%) are asymptomatic. However, when a gallstone obstructs the bile duct and causes acute cholestasis, a reflexive smooth muscle spasm often occurs, resulting in an intense cramp-like visceral pain in the right upper part of the abdomen known as a biliary colic (or &quot;gallbladder attack&quot;). This happens in 1–4% of those with gallstones each year. Complications from gallstones may include inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), obstructive jaundice, and infection in bile ducts (cholangitis). Symptoms of these complications may include pain that lasts longer than five hours, fever, yellowish skin, vomiting, dark urine, and pale stools.
Risk factors for gallstones include birth control pills, pregnancy, a family history of gallstones, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or rapid weight loss. The bile components that form gallstones include cholesterol, bile salts, and bilirubin. Gallstones formed mainly from cholesterol are termed &quot;cholesterol stones&quot;, and those formed mainly from bilirubin are termed &quot;pigment stones&quot;. Gallstones may be suspected based on symptoms. Diagnosis is then typically confirmed by ultrasound. Complications may be detected using blood tests.
The risk of gallstones may be decreased by maintaining a healthy weight with exercise and a healthy diet. If there are no symptoms, treatment is usually not needed. In those who are having gallbladder attacks, surgery to remove the gallbladder is typically recommended. This can be carried out either through several small incisions or through a single larger incision, usually under general anesthesia. In rare cases when surgery is not possible, medication can be used to dissolve the stones or lithotripsy can be used to break them down.
In developed countries, 10–15% of adults experience gallstones. Gallbladder and biliary-related diseases occurred in about 104 million people (1.6% of people) in 2013 and resulted in 106,000 deaths. Gallstones are more common among women than men and occur more commonly after the age of 40. Gallstones occur more frequently among certain ethnic groups than others. For example, 48% of Native Americans experience gallstones, whereas gallstone rates in many parts of Africa are as low as 3%. Once the gallbladder is removed, outcomes are generally positive.
==Definition==
Gallstone disease refers to the condition where gallstones are either in the gallbladder or common bile duct. The presence of stones in the gallbladder is referred to as &quot;cholelithiasis&quot;, from the Greek (, &#x27;bile&#x27;) + (, &#x27;stone&#x27;) + (, &#x27;process&#x27;). The presence of gallstones in the common bile duct is called &quot;choledocholithiasis&quot;, from the Greek (, &#x27;bile-containing&#x27;, from + , &#x27;duct&#x27;) + + . Choledocholithiasis is frequently associated with obstruction of the bile ducts, which can lead to &quot;cholangitis&quot;, from the Greek: + (, &#x27;vessel&#x27;) + (, &#x27;inflammation&#x27;), a serious infection of the bile ducts. Gallstones within the ampulla of Vater can obstruct the exocrine system of the pancreas and can result in pancreatitis.

==Signs and symptoms==

Gallstones, regardless of size or number, are often asymptomatic. These &quot;silent stones&quot; do not require treatment and can remain asymptomatic even years after they form. Sometimes, the pain may be referred to tip of the scapula in cholelithiasis; this is called &quot;Collin&#x27;s sign&quot;.

A characteristic symptom of a gallstone attack is the presence of colic-like pain in the upper-right side of the abdomen, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Pain from symptomatic gallstones may range from mild to severe and can steadily increase over a period lasting from 30 minutes to several hours. Other symptoms may include fever, as well as referred pain between the shoulder blades or below the right shoulder. If one or more gallstones block the bile ducts and cause bilirubin to leak into the bloodstream and surrounding tissue, jaundice and itching may also occur. In this case, liver enzyme levels are likely to be raised.

Often, gallbladder attacks occur after eating a heavy meal. Attacks are most common in the evening or at night.

===Other complications===
In rare cases, gallstones that cause severe inflammation can erode through the gallbladder into adherent bowel, potentially causing an obstruction termed gallstone ileus.

Other complications can include ascending cholangitis, which occurs when a bacterial infection causes purulent inflammation in the biliary tree and liver, and acute pancreatitis caused by blockage of the bile ducts that prevents active enzymes from being secreted into the bowel, instead damaging the pancreas. Rarely, gallbladder cancer may occur as a complication.

==Risk factors==
Gallstone risk increases for females (especially before menopause) and for people near or above 40 years; the condition is more prevalent among people of European or American Indigenous descent than among other ethnicities. A lack of melatonin could significantly contribute to gallbladder stones, as melatonin inhibits cholesterol secretion from the gallbladder, enhances the conversion of cholesterol to bile, and is an antioxidant, which is able to reduce oxidative stress to the gallbladder. Gilbert syndrome has been linked to an increased risk of gallstones. Researchers believe that gallstones may be caused by a combination of factors, including inherited body chemistry, body weight, gallbladder motility (movement), and low-calorie diet. The absence of such risk factors does not, however, preclude the formation of gallstones.

Nutritional factors that may increase risk of gallstones include constipation; eating fewer meals per day; low intake of the nutrients folate, magnesium, calcium, and vitamin C; low fluid consumption; and, at least for men, a high intake of carbohydrate, a high glycemic load, and high glycemic index diet. Wine and whole-grained bread may decrease the risk of gallstones.

Rapid weight loss increases risk of gallstones. The weight loss drug orlistat is known to increase the risk of gallstones.

Cholecystokinin deficiency caused by celiac disease increases risk of gallstone formation, especially when diagnosis of celiac disease is delayed.

Pigment gallstones are most commonly seen in the developing world. Risk factors for pigment stones include hemolytic anemias (such as from sickle-cell disease and hereditary spherocytosis), cirrhosis, and biliary tract infections. People with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) are at increased risk to develop gallstones. Additionally, prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors has been shown to decrease gallbladder function, potentially leading to gallstone formation.

Cholesterol modifying medications can affect gallstone formation. Statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis and there is evidence that their use may decrease the risk of getting gallstones. Fibrates increase cholesterol concentration in bile and their use has been associated with an increased risk of gallstones. Bile acid malabsorption may also be a risk.

==Pathophysiology==
Cholesterol gallstones develop when bile contains too much cholesterol and not enough bile salts. Besides a high concentration of cholesterol, two other factors are important in causing gallstones. The first is how often and how well the gallbladder contracts; incomplete and infrequent emptying of the gallbladder may cause the bile to become overconcentrated and contribute to gallstone formation. This can be caused by high resistance to the flow of bile out of the gallbladder due to the complicated internal geometry of the cystic duct. The second factor is the presence of proteins in the liver and bile that either promote or inhibit cholesterol crystallization into gallstones. In addition, increased levels of the hormone estrogen, as a result of pregnancy or hormone therapy, or the use of combined (estrogen-containing) forms of hormonal contraception, may increase cholesterol levels in bile and also decrease gallbladder motility, resulting in gallstone formation.

===Composition===

The composition of gallstones is affected by age, diet and ethnicity. On the basis of their composition, gallstones can be divided into the following types: cholesterol stones, pigment stones, and mixed stones. An ideal classification system is yet to be defined.

====Cholesterol stones====
Cholesterol stones vary from light yellow to dark green or brown or chalk white and are oval, usually solitary, between 2 and 3 cm long, each often having a tiny, dark, central spot. To be classified as such, they must be at least 80% cholesterol by weight (or 70%, according to the Japanese classification system). Between 35% and 90% of stones are cholesterol stones.

====Pigment stones====
Bilirubin (&quot;pigment&quot;, &quot;black pigment&quot;) stones are small, dark (often appearing black), and usually numerous. They are composed primarily of bilirubin (insoluble bilirubin pigment polymer) and calcium (calcium phosphate) salts that are found in bile. They contain less than 20% of cholesterol (or 30%, according to the Japanese classification system). Between 2% and 30% of stones are bilirubin stones.

====Mixed stones====
Mixed (brown pigment stones) typically contain 20–80% cholesterol (or 30–70%, according to the Japanese classification system). Other common constituents are calcium carbonate, palmitate phosphate, bilirubin and other bile pigments (calcium bilirubinate, calcium palmitate and calcium stearate). Because of their calcium content, they are often radiographically visible. They typically arise secondary to infection of the biliary tract which results in the release of β-glucuronidase (by injured hepatocytes and bacteria) which hydrolyzes bilirubin glucuronides and increases the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in bile. Between 4% and 20% of stones are mixed.

Gallstones can vary in size and shape from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball. The gallbladder may contain a single large stone or many smaller ones. Pseudoliths, sometimes referred to as sludge, are thick secretions that may be present within the gallbladder, either alone or in conjunction with fully formed gallstones.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is typically confirmed by abdominal ultrasound. Other imaging techniques used are ERCP and MRCP. Gallstone complications may be detected on blood tests.

On abdominal ultrasound, sinking gallstones usually have posterior acoustic shadowing. In floating gallstones, reverberation echoes (or comet-tail artifact) is seen instead in a clinical condition called adenomyomatosis. Another sign is wall-echo-shadow (WES) triad (or double-arc shadow) which is also characteristic of gallstones.

A positive Murphy&#x27;s sign is a common finding on physical examination during a gallbladder attack.
==Prevention==
Maintaining a healthy weight by getting sufficient exercise and eating a healthy diet that is high in fiber may help prevent gallstone formation.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) appears to prevent formation of gallstones during weight loss. A high fat diet during weight loss also appears to prevent gallstones.

==Treatment==
===Lithotripsy===
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is a non-invasive method to manage gallstones that uses high-energy sound waves to disintegrate them first applied in January 1985.
Side effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy include biliary pancreatitis and liver haematoma.
The term is derived from the Greek words meaning &#x27;breaking (or pulverizing) stones&#x27;: + , ).

===Surgical===
Cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) has a 99% chance of eliminating the recurrence of cholelithiasis. The lack of a gallbladder has no negative consequences in most people, however 10 to 15% of people develop postcholecystectomy syndrome, which may cause nausea, indigestion, diarrhea, and episodes of abdominal pain.

There are two surgical options for cholecystectomy:
* Open cholecystectomy is performed via an abdominal incision (laparotomy) below the lower right ribs. Recovery typically requires 3–5 days of hospitalization, with a return to normal diet a week after release and to normal activity several weeks after release.
* Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, introduced in the 1980s, is performed via three to four small puncture holes for a camera and instruments. Post-operative care typically includes a same-day release or a one-night hospital stay, followed by a few days of home rest and pain medication. Perforation of the gall bladder is not uncommon—it has been reported in the range of 10% to 40%. Unretrieved gallstone spillage has been reported as 6% to 30%, but gallstones that are not retrieved rarely cause complications (0.08%–0.3%).

Obstruction of the common bile duct with gallstones can sometimes be relieved by endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy (ERS) following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
Surgery carries risks and some people continue to experience symptoms (including pain) afterwards, for reasons that remain unclear. An alternative option is to adopt a ‘watch and wait’ strategy before operating to see if symptoms resolve. A study compared the 2 approaches for uncomplicated gallstones and after 18 months, both approaches were associated with similar levels of pain. The watch and wait approach was also less costly (more than £1000 less per patient).

===Medical===
The medications ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) have been used in treatment to dissolve gallstones. A 2013 meta-analysis concluded that UDCA or higher dietary fat content appeared to prevent formation of gallstones during weight loss. Medical therapy with oral bile acids has been used to treat small cholesterol stones, and for larger cholesterol gallstones when surgery is either not possible or unwanted. CDCA treatment can cause diarrhea, mild reversible hepatic injury, and a small increase in the plasma cholesterol level. UDCA may need to be taken for years.

==Use in alternative medicine==
Gallstones can be a valued by-product of animals butchered for meat because of their use as an antipyretic and antidote in the traditional medicine of some cultures, particularly traditional Chinese medicine. The most highly prized gallstones tend to be sourced from old dairy cows, termed calculus bovis or &quot;niu-huang&quot; (yellow thing of cattle) in Chinese. Some slaughterhouses carefully scrutinize workers for gallstone theft.

<text>This is a list of the highest points of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces and territories]], by height.

;Notes
*Fairweather Mountain is the officially gazetted name, but Mount Fairweather is the common usage. Mount Fairweather is on the boundary with Alaska, with only the summit and about 1/3 of the peak&#x27;s massif within British Columbia. The highest summit completely within British Columbia is Mount Waddington (, ) in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains.
*Because it is on the Continental Divide of the Americas, Mount Columbia is in British Columbia as well as Alberta.
*Nirvana is the unofficial name of this mountain and shows on alpine literature as such, the Canadian Government still refers to it as &quot;unnamed peak&quot;.
*This peak, which lies on the border between the two provinces, is known as Mount Caubvick in Newfoundland and Labrador and Mont D&#x27;Iberville in Quebec. The summit of the mountain is entirely within Labrador, about from the provincial border.
*The main peak of Maple Mountain has a higher vertical rise over the surrounding landscape, higher than the Ishpatina Ridge rising over Scarecrow Lake.

==Lowest points==
Since there is no land area of Canada that is below sea level, the lowest elevation of Canada is at any point along its maritime coast, and all provinces and territories except Alberta and Saskatchewan have a maritime coast. The shore of Lake Athabasca, which straddles Alberta and Saskatchewan, is Saskatchewan&#x27;s lowest dry point ( above sea level). The Slave River (which drains Lake Athabasca) flows from northeastern Alberta into the Northwest Territories and is Alberta&#x27;s lowest point at the N.W.T. border ( above sea level). However, the False Creek Tunnel, part of the Canada Line rail-based transit system in Vancouver, at below sea level, is the lowest publicly accessible point in Canada. Parts of Richmond, British Columbia are below sea-level, though behind dikes.

<text>The Free Internet Chess Server (FICS) is a volunteer-run online chess platform. When the original Internet Chess Server (ICS) was commercialized and rebranded as the Internet Chess Club (ICC) in 1995, a group of users and developers came together to fork the code and host an alternative committed to free access, and a rivalry between the two servers persisted for years. FICS users download one of several graphical client programs, connect to the server via telnet, and can play chess or variants at a range of time controls. Games played on FICS are stored in a database, which has been used to train chess engines and to support academic studies. Though based in the US, the user base is international. In addition to the games themselves, there are chat rooms, pairing systems, analysis tools, and ratings. A relay system displays high-profile tournament games for users to see. As of 2024, FICS is still operational, though has declined in popularity with the rise of web-based chess sites.

== History ==
=== Internet Chess Server ===
In January 1992, Michael Moore of the University of Utah and Richard Nash started the first online service facilitating live chess games, the American Internet Chess Server (commonly known as the Internet Chess Server or ICS). The initial release, accessible via telnet, was hosted at the University of Utah, but over its first two years it moved repeatedly across American universities, with additional servers opening and connecting to each other through Nash&#x27;s Internet Ratings Server. The software was coded, supported, and operated by volunteers. Daniel Sleator, professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, took over operation in July 1992 and improved the code. One of his primary contributions was a mechanism to adjust clock times for the effects of internet lag. He announced plans to commercialize the service, copyrighted the code in 1994, and rebranded it as the Internet Chess Club (ICC) in 1995, charging membership fees.

Sleator&#x27;s decision to commercialize the ICS was controversial, outraging members who felt the internet should be free and open, or who simply did not want to pay for a service which had been free. According to journalist Brad Stone, &quot;players lost their tempers and were exiled from the server, opposition groups were formed, lawsuits were threatened, ICC administrators were harassed, and plans to erect alternative servers were formed&quot;.

=== Development of a free alternative ===

Several former ICS programmers saw the move as exploiting their work and, on the day its rebranding was announced, they created a mailing list focused on developing an alternative. Work had been in progress, using Nash&#x27;s original code, since Sleator initially revealed his commercialization plans. Several developers contributed, led by Nash, Henrik Gram, David Flynn, and Chris Petroff. The effort led to servers in several places around the world and in the United States, with the latter consolidating to form the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS), launched on 5 March 1995. Its tagline is &quot;we do it for the game--not the money&quot;. 

=== Growth and rivalry with ICC ===
After a few months, FICS had 1,500 members. In 1998, the Free Internet Chess Organization (FICS) was organized as a nonprofit organization, although the formal entity was dissolved in 2007. The server is still maintained and administered by volunteers. FICS never matched the popularity of ICC, but as of 2012 it had about 900 people logged in at any given time, and by August 2014 it had over 650,000 registered accounts. In 2016, 50,000 active players played a total of 23 million games.

The two servers used different names for similar features, which were then part of the rivalry. For example, very fast games in which each player only has one or two minutes to make all their moves are called &quot;lightning&quot; on FICS but &quot;bullet&quot; on ICC. The terms became shibboleths, marking members of each community and derided by the other.

In a 2024 book, Peter Doggers drew a comparison between the FICS and ICC rivalry and the later Lichess vs. Chess.com rivalry, with one side committed to free and open principles and the other offering more features for a fee.

== Usage ==

FICS is accessible via telnet and was text-only by default. Before graphical interfaces, users would see a board created by ASCII characters, with the lines of the board created by hyphens and pipes, and pieces represented by letters. Whereas ICC has dedicated, proprietary graphical interfaces, several have been developed for FICS, with none having official status. The earliest were XICS and XBoard, with subsequent programs including WinBoard, BabasChess, Jin, Thief, Raptor, eboard, PyChess, and JavaBoard. Though built with pre-web technology, which typically requires a dedicated client, there are also web-based interfaces. Users can play using an anonymous guest account or register for an account with a username. Registered users can play games rated using the Glicko rating system, with separate ratings based on time control and chess variant.

Once connected, discussion takes place in a wide number of function-specific or subject-specific chat channels numbered 0 through 255. For example, channel 0 is for administrators only, 1 is for general help, 50 is general chat, and 49 is for tournaments. Though based in the US, FICS, like the ICS before it, was notable for its international diversity. Early descriptions of using the servers highlight playing against and talking with people from around the world, which was a rare experience in the 1990s.

=== Variants ===
In addition to standard chess, FICS hosts several chess variants, including suicide, loser&#x27;s, atomic, wild (including chess960), bughouse, and crazyhouse. It became known for the popularity of its variants and the strength of its variant players. In particular, &quot;Chess Daily News&quot; said it is &quot;well-known for featuring the best bughouse and crazyhouse play in the world&quot;.

=== Relay ===
FICS relays major live chess events. A bot takes the moves in ongoing games and relays them to special demo accounts bearing the names of players in the event. Users watch and comment on the games in progress. The relay has covered several World Chess Championships as well as Wijk aan Zee, Morelia-Linares and Amber Melody. The web-based Lichess platform obtains its tournament relays via FICS.

=== Archive ===
All games played by registered users are recorded and made publicly available for free. The FICS game archive has been used in chess opening studies, academic studies on memory, decision-making, and user interface design. The server and its archive have been used to train chess engines and chess-related machine learning projects, while the FICS code has been used to launch similar regional or thematic chess servers as well as influencing the design of other chess projects.

<text>A dentist, also known as a dental surgeon, is a health care professional who specializes in dentistry, the branch of medicine focused on the teeth, gums, and mouth. The dentist&#x27;s supporting team aids in providing oral health services. The dental team includes dental assistants, dental hygienists, dental technicians, and sometimes dental therapists.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
In China as well as France, the first people to perform dentistry were barbers. They have been categorized into 2 distinct groups: guild of barbers and lay barbers. The first group, the Guild of Barbers, was created to distinguish more educated and qualified dental surgeons from lay barbers. Guild barbers were trained to do complex surgeries. The second group, the lay barbers, were qualified to perform regular hygienic services such as shaving and tooth extraction as well as basic surgery. However, in 1400, France made decrees prohibiting lay barbers from practicing all types of surgery. In Germany as well as France from 1530 to 1575 publications completely devoted to dentistry were being published. Ambroise Paré, often known as the Father of Surgery, published his own work about the proper maintenance and treatment of teeth. Ambroise Paré was a French barber surgeon who performed dental care for multiple French monarchs. He is often credited with having raised the status of barber surgeons.

===Modern dentistry===

Pierre Fauchard of France is often referred to as the &quot;father of modern dentistry&quot; because in 1728 he was the first to publish a scientific textbook on the techniques and practices of dentistry. Over time, trained dentists immigrated from Europe to the Americas to practice dentistry, and by 1760, America had its own native born practicing dentists. Newspapers were used at the time to advertise and promote dental services. In America from 1768 to 1770 the first application of dentistry to verify forensic cases was being pioneered; this was called forensic dentistry. With the rise of dentists, there was also the rise of new methods to improve the quality of dentistry. These new methods included the spinning wheel to rotate a drill and chairs made specifically for dental patients.

In the 1840s, the world&#x27;s first dental school and national dental organization were established. Along with the first dental school came the establishment of the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree, often referred to as a DDS degree. In response to the rise in new dentists as well as dentistry techniques, the first dental practice act was established to regulate dentistry. In the United States, the First Dental Practice Act required dentists to pass each specific state medical board exam in order to practice dentistry in that particular state. However, because the dental act was rarely enforced, some dentists did not obey the act. From 1846 to 1855, new dental techniques were being invented such as the use of ester anesthesia for surgery, and the cohesive gold foil method which enabled gold to be applied to a cavity. The American Dental Association was established in 1859 after a meeting with 26 dentists. Around 1867, the first university-associated dental school was established, Harvard Dental School. Lucy Hobbs Taylor was the first woman to earn a dental degree.

In the 1880s, tube toothpaste was created which replaced the original forms of powder or liquid toothpaste. New dental boards, such as the National Association of Dental Examiners, were created to establish standards and uniformity among dentists. In 1887, the first dental laboratory was established; dental laboratories are used to create dentures and crowns that are specific to each patient. In 1895, the dental X-ray was discovered by a German physicist, Wilhelm Röntgen.

In the 20th century, new dental techniques and technology were invented such as the porcelain crowns (1903), Novocain (a local anesthetic) 1905, precision cast fillings (1907), nylon toothbrushes (1938), water fluoridation (1945), fluoride toothpaste (1950), air driven dental tools (1957), lasers (1960), electric toothbrushes (1960), and home tooth bleaching kits (1989) were invented. Inventions such as the air driven dental tools ushered in a new high-speed dentistry.

==Responsibilities==
By nature of their general training, a licensed dentist can carry out most dental treatments such as restorative (dental restorations, crowns, bridges), orthodontics (braces), prosthodontic (dentures, crown/bridge), endodontic (root canal) therapy, periodontal (gum) therapy, and oral surgery (extraction of teeth), as well as performing examinations, taking radiographs (x-rays) and diagnosis. Additionally, dentists can further engage in oral surgery procedures such as dental implant placement. Dentists can also prescribe medications such as antibiotics, fluorides, pain killers, local anesthetics, sedatives/hypnotics and any other medications that serve in the treatment of the various conditions that arise in the head and neck.

All DDS and DMD degree holders are legally qualified to perform a number of more complex procedures such as gingival grafts, bone grafting, sinus lifts, and implants, as well as a range of more invasive oral and maxillofacial surgery procedures, though many choose to pursue residencies or other post-doctoral education to augment their abilities. A few select procedures, such as the administration of General anesthesia, legally require postdoctoral training in the US. While many oral diseases are unique and self-limiting, poor conditions in the oral cavity can lead to poor general health and vice versa; notably, there is a significant link between periodontal, cardiovascular, and endocrine diseases. Conditions in the oral cavity may also be indicative of other systemic diseases such as osteoporosis, diabetes, AIDS, and various blood diseases, including malignancies and lymphoma. Dentists can also prescribe medicines.

Several studies have suggested that dentists and dental students are at high risk of burnout. During burnout, dentists experience exhaustion, alienate from work and perform less efficiently. A systemic study identified risk factors associated with this condition such as practitioner&#x27;s young age, personality type, gender, the status of education, high job strain, working hours, and the burden of clinical degrees requisites. The authors of this study concluded that intervention programs at an early stage during the undergraduate level may provide practitioners with a good strategy to prepare for and cope with this condition.

== Regulations ==
Depending on the country, all dentists are required to register with their national or local health board, regulators, and professional indemnity insurance, in order to practice dentistry. In the UK, dentists are required to register with the General Dental Council. In Australia, it is the Dental Board of Australia, while in the United States, dentists are registered according to the individual state board. The main role of a dental regulator is to protect the public by ensuring only qualified dental practitioners are registered, handle any complaints or misconduct, and develop national guidelines and standards for dental practitioners to follow.

==List of specialties ==
For many countries, after satisfactory completion of post-graduate training, dental specialists are required to join a specialist board or list, in order to use the title &#x27;specialist&#x27;.

=== United States ===
In the US, dental specialties are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) or the American Board of Dental Specialties (ABDS) Currently, the ADA lists twelve dental specialties, who are recognized by the National Commission on Recognition of Dental Specialties and Certifying Boards, while the ABDS recognizes four dental specialty boards.

List of Dental Specialties under the ADA:

*Dental anesthesiology – The study and administration of general anesthesia, sedation, local anesthesia and advanced methods of pain control. Recognized by both ADA and ABDS.
*Dental public health – The study of dental epidemiology and social health policies.
*Endodontics – Root canal therapy and study of diseases of the dental pulp.
* Oral and maxillofacial pathology – The study, diagnosis, and sometimes the treatment of oral and maxillofacial-related diseases.
* Oral and maxillofacial radiology – The study and radiologic interpretation of oral and maxillofacial diseases.
*Oral and maxillofacial surgery – Extractions, implants, and maxillofacial surgery which also includes correction of congenital facial deformities
*Oral Surgery. A recognized specialty in Europe and Australia. A specialty devoted to surgery within the oral cavity. Mainly the extraction of teeth, the exposure of teeth, treatment of cystic lesions, and treatment of patients with medical complicating factors.
*Oral medicine - the discipline of dentistry concerned with the oral health care of medically complex patients – including the diagnosis and management of medical conditions that affect the oral and maxillofacial region&quot;.&quot; Recognized by both ADA and ABDS.
*Orofacial pain - the specialty of dentistry that encompasses the diagnosis, management, and treatment of pain disorders of the jaw, mouth, face, and associated regions. Recognized by both ADA and ABDS.
*Orthodontics and dentofacial orthopaedics – The straightening of teeth and modification of midface and mandibular growth.
*Periodontics – Study and treatment of diseases of the gums (non-surgical and surgical) as well as placement and maintenance of dental implants
*Pediatric dentistry (formerly pedodontics) – Dentistry for children. Teeth, bones, and jaw continually grow in children and certain dental issues in children require specific attention.
*Prosthodontics – Dentures, bridges and dental implants (restoring/placing). Some prosthodontists further their training in &quot;oral and maxillofacial prosthodontics&quot;, which is the discipline concerned with the replacement of missing facial structures, such as ears, eyes, noses, etc.

List of Dental Specialties under the ABDS:

* Oral implantology/implant dentistry 
* Oral medicine
* Orofacial pain
* Dental anesthesiology

Specialists in these fields are designated &quot;registrable&quot; (in the United States, &quot;board eligible&quot;) and warrant exclusive titles such as dentist anesthesiologist, orthodontist, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, endodontist, pediatric dentist, periodontist, or prosthodontist upon satisfying certain local accreditation requirements (U.S., &quot;Board Certified&quot;)

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, the specialties are recognized by the General Dental Council (GDC). Currently the GDC lists 13 different dental specialties:

* Dental &amp; maxillofacial radiology – This specialty includes any medical imaging used to supplement investigations with relevant information about the anatomy, function, and health of the teeth, jaws, and surrounding structures.
* Dental public health – This is a non-clinical specialty that assesses the needs of dental health and explores the ways in which they can be met. 
* Endodontics – This specialty includes the aetiology, diagnosis, treatment options, and prevention of disease that affects the nerve tissue found inside a tooth, roots, and surrounding tissues. 
* Oral &amp; Maxillofacial pathology – This is a clinical specialty that is undertaken by laboratory-based personnel. It assesses the changes in the tissues of the oral cavity, jaws, and salivary glands that are characteristic of disease to aid in coming to a diagnosis.
* Restorative dentistry – This is based on three monospecialities. These are endodontics, periodontics and prosthodontics. Periodontists are dentists that specialize in preventing, diagnosing, and treating gum disease. Prosthodontists deal with missing teeth. 
* Oral medicine – This specialty deals with the diagnosis and non-surgical management of patients with disorders related to the oral and maxillofacial region.
*Oral Microbiology – This clinical specialty involves diagnosing, reporting, and interpreting microbiological samples taken from mouth
*Oral Surgery – This clinical specialty manages any abnormalities of the jaw and mouth that requires surgery
*Orthodontics – This clinical specialty deals with correcting the irregularities of the teeth, jaw, and bite
*Paediatric dentistry – This clinical specialty provides comprehensive oral health care for children from infants to adolescents including children with mental or physical impairments
*Periodontics – This clinical specialty is involved in the diagnosis and treatment of gums
*Prosthodontics – This clinical specialty deals with replacing missing teeth by using fixed or removable prosthesis such as implants, bridges, dentures
*Special needs dentistry – This clinical specialty is trained to improve and manage the oral health of adults with disability inc physical, mental, medical, social, emotional, and learning impairments

=== European Union ===
European Union legislation recognizes two dental specialties: Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (A degree in dentistry and medicine being compulsory) and Orthodontics.

<doc id="287543" wikidata="Q1145674" url="?curid=287543" title="Necrotizing fasciitis">
<text>Necrotizing fasciitis (NF), also known as flesh-eating disease, is an infection that kills the body&#x27;s soft tissue. It is a serious disease that begins and spreads quickly. Symptoms include red or purple or black skin, swelling, severe pain, fever, and vomiting. The most commonly affected areas are the limbs and perineum.
Bacterial infection is by far the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis. Despite being called a &quot;flesh-eating disease&quot;, bacteria do not eat human tissue. Rather, they release toxins that cause tissue death. Typically, the infection enters the body through a break in the skin such as a cut or burn. Risk factors include recent trauma or surgery and a weakened immune system due to diabetes or cancer, obesity, alcoholism, intravenous drug use, and peripheral artery disease. It does not usually spread between people. The disease is classified into four types, depending on the infecting organisms. Medical imaging is often helpful to confirm the diagnosis.
Necrotizing fasciitis is treated with surgery to remove the infected tissue, and antibiotics. It is considered a surgical emergency. Delays in surgery are associated with a much higher risk of death. Despite high-quality treatment, the risk of death remains between 25 and 35%.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms emerge very quickly, often within hours. Manifestations include:

* Redness and swelling
* Induration (hardening of the skin and soft tissue)
* Excessive pain
* Systemic symptoms, including high fever &gt; 102 °F, fatigue, muscle pains
* Large amounts of smelly pus and discharge, especially at a surgical site

The initial skin changes are similar to cellulitis or abscess, so diagnosis in early stages may be difficult. The redness and swelling usually blend into surrounding normal tissues. The overlying skin may appear shiny and tense as well.

Later signs more suggestive of necrotizing changes (but only present in less than half of cases) are:

* Bullae (blisters)
* Crepitus (palpable gas in tissues)
* Reduced or absent sensation over the skin of the affected area 
* Ecchymosis (bruising) that progresses to skin necrosis. This is because the skin changes color from red to purple and black due to clotting blood vessels

Rapid progression to shock despite antibiotic therapy is another indication of necrotizing fasciitis. However, those who are immunocompromised may not show typical symptoms. This includes but is not limited to patients with:

* Cancer or malignancy
* Corticosteroid use
* Current radiotherapy or chemotherapy
* HIV/AIDS
* History of organ or bone marrow transplant

Immunocompromised persons are twice as likely to die from necrotizing infections compared to the greater population, so higher suspicion should be maintained in this group.

==Causes==

===Risk factors===
Vulnerable populations are typically older with medical comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, and immunodeficiency. Other documented risk factors include:

* Any trauma or lacerations
* Injection drug use
* Recent surgery
* Injury of mucous membranes, including hemorrhoids, rectal fissures
* Peripheral artery disease
* Cancer
* Alcohol use disorder
* Pregnancy or recent childbirth

For reasons that are unclear, it can also infect healthy individuals with no previous medical history or injury.

NSAIDs may increase the rates of necrotizing infections by impairing the body&#x27;s immune response. NSAIDs inhibit the production of prostaglandins responsible for fever, inflammation, and pain. In theory, it also prevents white blood cells from migrating to infected areas, thus increasing the risk of soft-tissue infections.

Skin infections such as abscesses and ulcers can also complicate NF. A small percentage of people can also get NF when bacteria from streptococcal pharyngitis spreads through the blood. For infection of the perineum and genitals (Fournier gangrene), urinary tract infection, renal stones, and Bartholin gland abscess may also be implicated.

=== Prevention ===
Good wound care and handwashing reduces the risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis. It is unclear if people with a weakened immune system would benefit from taking antibiotics after being exposed to a necrotizing infection. Generally, such a regimen entails 250 mg penicillin four times daily for 10 days.

===Bacteria===
Necrotizing fasciitis is divided into four classes by the type of bacteria causing the infection. This classification system was first described by Giuliano and his colleagues in 1977.

Type I infection: This is the most common type of infection, and accounts for 70 to 80% of cases. It is caused by a mixture of bacterial types, usually in abdominal or groin areas. These bacterial species include:

* Gram-positive cocci (&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, and Enterococci)
* Gram-negative rods (&quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella species,&quot; &quot;Bacteroides&quot; species, &quot;Prevotella&quot; species)
* &quot;Clostridium&quot; species (&quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;, &quot;Clostridium septicum&quot;, and &quot;Clostridium sordellii&quot;)

In polymicrobial (mixed) infections, Group A Streptococcus (&quot;S. pyogenes&quot;) is the most commonly found bacterium, followed by &quot;S. aureus.&quot; However, when the infection is caused solely by &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; and/or &quot;S. aureus&quot;, it is classified as a Type II infection.

Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes like &quot;Clostridia&quot; are more often implicated in Fournier gangrene. This is a subtype of Type I infections affecting the groin and perianal areas. &quot;Clostridia&quot; account for 10% of overall type I infections and typically cause a specific kind of necrotizing fasciitis known as gas gangrene or myonecrosis.

Type II infection: This infection accounts for 20 to 30% of cases, mainly involving the extremities. This involves &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, alone or in combination with staphylococcal infections. Methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) is involved in up to a third of Type II infections. Infection by either type of bacteria can progress rapidly and manifest as shock. Type II infection more commonly affects young, healthy adults with a history of injury.

Type III infection: &quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; is a bacterium found in saltwater. It occasionally causes NF after entering the body through a break in the skin. One in three patients with a &quot;V. vulnificus&quot; infection develop necrotizing fasciitis. Disease progression is similar to type II but sometimes with few visible skin changes.

Type IV infection: This type of NF accounts for less than 1% of cases. It is mostly caused by the &quot;Candida albicans&quot; fungus. Risk factors include age and immunodeficiency.

==Diagnosis==
Early diagnosis is difficult, as the disease often first appears like a simple superficial skin infection. While a number of labs and imaging can raise the suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis, none can rule it out. The gold standard for diagnosis is a surgical exploration and subsequent tissue biopsy. When in doubt, a 2-cm incision can be made into the affected tissue under local anesthesia. If a finger easily separates the tissue along the fascia, then the finger test is positive. This confirms the diagnosis, and an extensive debridement should be performed.

=== Medical imaging ===

Necrotizing fasciitis is ideally a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms. Due to the need for rapid surgical treatment, the time delay in performing imaging is a major concern. Hence, imaging may not be needed if signs of a necrotizing infection are clear. However, due to the vague symptoms associated with the earlier stages of this disease, imaging is often useful in clarifying or confirming the diagnosis.

Both CT scan and MRI are used to diagnose NF, but neither are sensitive enough to rule out necrotizing changes completely.

==== Computed tomography (CT) ====

If available, computed tomography (CT) is the most convenient tool in diagnosing NF due to its speed and resolution (detects about 80% of NF cases). CT scan may show fascial thickening, edema, or abscess formation. CT is able to pick up on gas within tissues better than MRI, but it is not unusual for NF to present without gas on imaging. In addition, CT is helpful in evaluating complications due to NF and finding possible sources of infections. Its use may be limited in pregnant patients and patients with kidney issues.

==== Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ====

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered superior to computed tomography (CT) in the visualization of soft tissues and is able to detect about 93% of NF cases. It is especially useful in finding fluid in the deep fascia, which can distinguish between NF and cellulitis. When fluid collects in the deep fascia, or thickening or enhancement with contrast, necrotizing fasciitis should be strongly suspected. However, MRI is much slower than CT and not as widely available. There may also be limitations on its use in patients with kidney problems.

==== Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) ====
Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) may be useful in the diagnosis of NF if MRI and CT are not available. It can also help rule out diagnoses that mimic earlier stages of NF, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), superficial abscesses, and venous stasis. Linear probes are generally preferred for the assessment, especially in the extremities.

Findings characteristic of NF include abnormal thickening, air, or fluid in the subcutaneous tissue. This can be summarized as the mnemonic &quot;STAFF&quot; (Subcutaneous irregularity or Thickening, Air, and Fascial Fluid). The official diagnosis of NF using ultrasound requires &quot;the presence of BOTH diffuse subcutaneous thickening AND fascial fluid more than 2 mm.&quot; Gas in the subcutaneous tissue may show &quot;dirty acoustic shadowing.&quot; However, similar to other imaging modalities, the absence of subcutaneous free air does not definitively rule out a diagnosis of NF, because this is a finding that often emerges later in the disease process.

Of note, the quality and accuracy of POCUS is highly user-dependent. It may also be difficult to visualize NF over larger areas, or if there are many intervening layers of fat or muscle. It is still unclear whether POCUS improves the speed of diagnosis of NF, or if it reduces the time to surgical intervention as a whole.

==== Plain radiography (X-ray) ====
It is difficult to distinguish NF from cellulitis in earlier stages of the disease using plain radiography. X-rays can detect subcutaneous emphysema (gas in the subcutaneous tissue), which is strongly suggestive of necrotizing changes. However, air is often a late-stage finding, and not all necrotizing skin infections create subcutaneous emphysema. Hence, radiography is not recommended for the initial diagnosis of NF. However, it may be able to identify the source of infection, such as foreign bodies or fractures, and thus aid in subsequent treatment.

===Scoring system===
Correlated with clinical findings, a white blood cell count greater than 15,000 cells/mm3 and serum sodium level less than 135 mmol/L are predictive of necrotizing fasciitis in 90% of cases. If lab values do not meet those values, there is a 99% chance that the patient does not have NF. There are various scoring systems to determine the likelihood of getting necrotizing fasciitis. The laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) scoring system developed by Wong and their colleagues in 2004 is the most common. It evaluates people with severe cellulitis or abscess to determine the likelihood of necrotizing fasciitis.

LRINEC uses six laboratory values: C-reactive protein, total white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, creatinine, and blood glucose. A score of 6 or more indicates that there is a 50-75% probability of necrotizing fasciitis. A score of 8 or more represents over 75% likelihood of NF. Patients with a LRINEC score ≥6 may have a higher rate of both death and amputation as well. The scoring criteria are:

However, this scoring system is yet to be validated. A LRINEC score ≥6 is only able to detect 70% of NF cases, and a LRINEC score ≥8 has shown even poorer sensitivity. Moreover, these lab values may be falsely positive if any other inflammatory conditions are present. Therefore, this scoring system should be interpreted with caution.

==Treatment==
Necrotizing fasciitis is treated with surgical debridement (cutting away affected tissue). However, antibiotics should be started as soon as this condition is suspected. Appropriate antibiotic coverage may be changed based on tissue cultures. Additional support should be initiated for those with unstable vital signs and low urine output.

===Surgery===
Aggressive wound debridement should be performed as soon as the diagnosis is made. The affected area may need to be debrided several times, usually once every 12–36 hours. Large sections of tissue and muscle may need to be removed to prevent the infection from spreading. Amputation may be needed if the infection is too severe.

&quot;En bloc&quot; debridement (EBd) is most commonly employed in treating NSTIs. This involves cutting away the skin overlying all diseased areas at the cost of increased scar formation and potential decreased quality of life post-operatively. More recently, skin-sparing debridement (SSd) has gained traction, as it resects the underlying tissue and sources of infection while preserving skin that is not overtly necrotic. However, more studies are needed to examine whether SSd actually accelerates the healing process after surgery.

After the wound debridement, adequate dressings should be applied to promote wound healing. Wounds are generally packed with wet-to-dry dressings and left open to heal. In certain cases, vacuum-sealing drainage (VSD) may help the wound heal, especially in Fournier gangrene.

For necrotizing infection of the perineal area (Fournier&#x27;s gangrene), wound debridement and wound care in this area can be difficult because of the excretory products that often render this area dirty and affect the wound-healing process. Therefore, regular dressing changes with a fecal management system can help to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Sometimes, colostomy may be necessary to divert the excretory products to keep the wound at the perineal area clean.

===Antibiotics===
Empiric antibiotics are usually initiated as soon as the diagnosis of NSTI has been made. They are then changed to culture-guided antibiotic therapy. In the case of NSTIs, empiric antibiotics are broad-spectrum, covering gram-positive (including MRSA), gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. Often, a combination of clindamycin, daptomycin, IV vancomycin, and gentamicin is used. Gram-negative coverage may entail the use of fluoroquinolones, piperacillin/tazobactam, or carbapenems.

Despite multiple studies, there is no consensus on how long antibiotics should be given. Generally, antibiotics are administered until surgeons decide that no further debridement is needed, and the patient no longer shows any systemic signs of infection from a clinical and laboratory standpoint. Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment and adverse effects is also unclear.

===Add-on therapy===
* Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO): In theory, HBO decreases local inflammation in the wound and bolsters the body&#x27;s immune response. However, the impact of HBO in patients with NSTIs remains unclear.
* Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG): IVIG is intended to combat the exotoxins released by &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; toxic shock syndrome (TSS). However, studies have failed to find any effect on patient mortality. There may also be serious adverse effects with IVIG use.
* AB103: Reltecimod aka AB103 is a new drug that binds to the CD28 T-cell receptor and thus mitigates the effects of bacterial toxins. Studies show that it may decrease the severity of organ failure in NF patients. However, other studies found no difference in mortality with this therapy.
* Supportive therapy: Intravenous hydration, wound care, anticoagulants to prevent thromboembolic events, pain control, vasopressors, etc. should always be provided to patients when appropriate.

==Epidemiology==

=== Prevalence ===
Necrotizing fasciitis occurs in about 4 people per million per year in the U.S., and about 1 per 100,000 in Western Europe. About 1,000 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur per year in the United States, but the rates have been increasing. This could be due to increasing awareness of this condition and increased reporting, or increasing antibiotic resistance. Both sexes are affected equally. It is more common among older people and is rare in children.

=== Anatomical location ===
Necrotizing fasciitis can occur at any part of the body, but it is more commonly seen at the extremities, perineum, and genitals. A small fraction of cases arise in the head/neck, chest and abdomen.

==History==
In the fifth century BCE, Hippocrates was the first to describe necrotizing soft tissue infections.&quot;Erysipelas all over the body while the cause was only a trivial accident. Bones, flesh, and sinew (cord, tendon, or nerve) would fall off from the body and there were many deaths&quot;. Necrotizing soft-tissue infections were first described in English by British surgeon Leonard Gillespie and British physicians Gilbert Blaine and Thomas Trotter in the 18th century. At that time, there was no standardized name for NSTIs. They were variably described as severe ulcers, gangrene, erysipelas, or cellulitis. Later, &quot;hospital gangrene&quot; became more commonly used. In 1871, Confederate States Army surgeon Joseph Jones reported 2,642 cases of hospital gangrene with a mortality rate of 46%. 

In 1883, Dr Jean-Alfred Fournier described necrotizing infections of the perineum and scrotum, now named after him as Fournier gangrene. The term &quot;necrotizing fasciitis&quot; was coined by Dr. Bob Wilson in 1952. Since then, its definition has broadened to include infections of fascia and soft tissue. Despite being disfavored by the medical community, the term &quot;galloping gangrene&quot; was frequently used in sensationalistic news media to refer to outbreaks of necrotizing fasciitis.

==Society and culture==
=== Notable cases ===
* 1994: Lucien Bouchard, future premier of Québec, Canada, who was infected while leader of the federal official opposition Bloc Québécois party, lost a leg to the illness.
* 1994: A cluster of cases occurred in Gloucestershire, in the west of England. Of five confirmed and one probable infection, two died. The cases were believed to be connected. The first two had acquired the &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; bacteria during surgery; the remaining four were community-acquired. The cases generated much newspaper coverage, with lurid headlines such as &quot;Flesh Eating Bug Ate My Face&quot;.
* 1997: Ken Kendrick, former agent and partial owner of the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks, contracted the disease. He had seven surgeries in a little more than a week and later fully recovered.
* 2004: Don Rickles, American stand-up comedian, actor, and author, known especially for his insult comedy, contracted the disease in his left leg. He had six operations and later recovered. The condition confined him in his later years to performing comedy from a chair.
* 2004: Eric Allin Cornell, winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics, lost his left arm and shoulder to the disease.
* 2005: Alexandru Marin, an experimental particle physicist, professor at MIT, Boston University, and Harvard University, and researcher at CERN and JINR, died from the disease.
* 2006: Alan Coren, British writer and satirist, announced in his Christmas column for &quot;The Times&quot; that his long absence as a columnist had been caused by his contracting the disease while on holiday in France.
* 2009: R. W. Johnson, British journalist and historian, contracted the disease in March after injuring his foot while swimming. His leg was amputated above the knee.
* 2011: Jeff Hanneman, guitarist for the thrash metal band Slayer, contracted the disease. He died of liver failure two years later, on May 2, 2013, and it was speculated that his infection was the cause of death. However, on May 9, 2013, the official cause of death was announced as alcohol-related cirrhosis. Hanneman and his family had apparently been unaware of the extent of the condition until shortly before his death.
* 2011: Peter Watts, Canadian science fiction author, contracted the disease. On his blog, Watts reported, &quot;I&#x27;m told I was a few hours away from being dead ... If there was ever a disease fit for a science-fiction writer, flesh-eating disease has got to be it. This ... spread across my leg as fast as a &quot;Star Trek&quot; space disease in time-lapse.&quot;
* 2013: British actress Georgie Henley revealed in 2022 that she had contracted the disease several weeks after starting at Cambridge University and that it had almost claimed her life.
* 2014: Daniel Gildenlöw, Swedish singer and songwriter for the band Pain of Salvation, spent several months in a hospital after being diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis on his back in early 2014. After recovering, he wrote the album &quot;In the Passing Light of Day&quot;, a concept album about his experience during the hospitalization.
* 2014: Ricky Bartlett, CBS Radio Morning Host, had his left leg amputated. He got the disease during a trip to Wyoming and South Dakota, USA. He lost his right leg to bone disease (associated with the flesh eating disease he contacted) in 2022.
* 2015: Edgar Savisaar, Estonian politician, had his right leg amputated. He got the disease during a trip to Thailand.
* 2018: Alex Smith, an American football quarterback for the Washington Football Team of the National Football League (NFL), contracted the disease after being injured during a game. He suffered an open compound fracture in his lower leg, which became infected. Smith narrowly avoided amputation, and eventually returned to playing professional football in October 2020. Smith&#x27;s injury and recovery is the subject of the ESPN documentary &quot;E60 Presents: Project 11&quot;.
* 2021: Irish actor Barry Keoghan revealed in 2024 that he contracted NF shortly before filming &quot;The Banshees of Inisherin&quot; and nearly had his arm amputated.

<doc id="287553" wikidata="Q6678694" url="?curid=287553" title="George Cambridge, 2nd Marquess of Cambridge">
<text>George Francis Hugh Cambridge, 2nd Marquess of Cambridge, (11 October 1895 – 16 April 1981), known as Prince George of Teck until 1917 and as Earl of Eltham from 1917 to 1927, was a relative of the British royal family, a great-great-grandson of King George III and nephew of Queen Mary and King George V. He was also nephew to the 1st Earl of Athlone. He was the elder son of the 1st Marquess of Cambridge, formerly the Duke of Teck, and his wife, the former Lady Margaret Grosvenor.

==Early life==
Born at Grosvenor House, the home of his maternal grandfather, the 1st Duke of Westminster, he was styled His Serene Highness Prince George of Teck from birth. On his father&#x27;s side, he was descended from King George III and—morganatically—from the Royal House of Württemberg. In June 1917, at the request of George V, his father relinquished the titles, styles, and designations, &quot;Highness&quot;, &quot;Duke of Teck&quot; and &quot;of Teck&quot; in the Kingdom of Württemberg and the German Empire, and assumed the surname Cambridge by Royal Licence and Warrant. The former Duke of Teck was subsequently created Marquess of Cambridge, Earl of Eltham and Viscount Northallerton in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Prince George became George Cambridge and was styled Earl of Eltham as a courtesy title. He succeeded his father as 2nd Marquess of Cambridge on 24 October 1927. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in June 1927 and was promoted to Knight Grand Cross in June 1935.

==Education and career==
Prince George of Teck was educated at Ludgrove School and Eton College followed by Magdalen College, Oxford. He joined the Reserve Regiment of the 1st Life Guards during World War I and served as an aide-de-camp on the Personal Staff in 1918–1919.

In the inter-war years, he served with the Territorial Army as a lieutenant in the Shropshire Yeomanry from 1921, then as captain in the 16th Battalion, London Regiment from 1929 to 1932.

At the outbreak of World War II he mobilised as Captain with the Royal Army Service Corps and served in France, rising to rank of Major.

In 1929, he became a director of Coutts &amp; Company, a banking firm. This made him the second member of the British royal family (albeit, a very minor one) to pursue a career in the City of London. He remained with the firm until his retirement in 1951.

==Personal life==
On 10 April 1923 at Beaumanor Hall, he married Dorothy Isabel Westenra Hastings (18 May 1899 Cirencester – 1 April 1988), daughter of The Hon. Osmund William Toone Westenra Hastings, a younger son of the 14th Earl of Huntingdon, and his wife Mary Caroline Campbell Tarratt, daughter of Daniel Fox Tarratt, Gent.

The couple had one child, Lady Mary Cambridge (24 September 1924 – 13 December 1999).

Lord and Lady Cambridge regularly attended major royal occasions, although they did not carry out royal duties. Lord Cambridge participated in the coronations of George V, George VI, and Elizabeth II. For many years he served as Royal Trustee of the British Museum.

Lord Cambridge died on 16 April 1981 in Little Abington, and was buried in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore. His peerages became extinct. His brother, Lord Frederick Cambridge, had died while fighting in Belgium during World War II.

<text>Paul Duane Beauregard (born January 12, 1977), known professionally as DJ Paul, is an American rapper and record producer. He is a founding member of hip hop group Three 6 Mafia and the uncle of rapper Lord Infamous. DJ Paul is also the half-brother of convicted drug lord Craig Petties. He is also a part owner of FaZe Clan.

DJ Paul started his career in the late 1980s as a DJ and released a number of solo tapes, as well as three collaboration albums with Lord Infamous as The Serial Killaz. Juicy J was introduced and the three founded the group Three 6 Mafia, going on to achieve national success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Their 2000 album, &quot;When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1&quot;, debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was certified platinum. Later followed by &quot;Da Unbreakables&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Most Known Unknown&quot; in 2005, both of which were commercially successful. In 2006, DJ Paul, Juicy J, Crunchy Black, and Frayser Boy won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;It&#x27;s Hard out Here for a Pimp&quot; from the film &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot;. Paul has also released three solo albums, and created soundtracks to two movies. He and the rest of Three 6 Mafia are known as the originators of the crunk style of music. In 2018, he co-produced the track &quot;Talk Up&quot; from Drake&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Scorpion&quot;.

Aside from music, DJ Paul has been involved in a variety of business ventures, including film production and real estate. He founded his own record label Scale-A-Ton Entertainment, co-owns the fashion wear line Dangerus / Skandulus, has a collection of BBQ seasonings and is the spokesman for a legal version of the drink Sizzurp.

== Career ==
=== 1988–1992: Career beginnings ===
In 1988, DJ Paul started his career at age 11 as a DJ in Memphis club &quot;380 Beale&quot;. At first he wanted to focus on DJing instead of rapping. In 1989, he formed the duo The Serial Killaz, together with his half-brother Lord Infamous. Paul served as the producer, making beats, which Infamous would rap over. The two did not have any equipment, so they used to rent local DJ Just Born&#x27;s studio with the money their father gave them. Paul would play and scratch records on his mother&#x27;s record player when she was not home. They released self-recorded tapes in their neighborhood, school, and local shops. Their first tape, &quot;Portrait of a Serial Killa&quot;, was released in 1992. In the following years, the duo went on to release &quot;The Serial Killaz&quot; tape and two parts of &quot;Come with Me 2 Hell&quot;.
DJ Paul eventually bought studio equipment, consisting of a keyboard, a turntable, and a four-track recorder. He started making mixtapes with popular songs and selling them at his high school. Later he started including songs of his affiliated rappers on the tapes as well, in order to promote them. Eventually, he began making mixtapes consisting only of original songs by himself and local artists. Paul claimed that Memphis DJs, such as himself, DJ Spanish Fly, DJ Squeeky and Juicy J created the modern format of mixtapes by including their original songs, instead of making compilations of other artists&#x27; music.

DJ Paul also released a number of solo tapes called Volume 1 to Volume 16. He rose to prominence as a DJ and producer on the south side of Memphis, and was introduced to fellow producer Juicy J, who was also garnering buzz on the north side of the city. Together with Lord Infamous, they formed the group The Backyard Posse. DJ Paul and Juicy J soon began producing tracks, described as &quot;dark, eerie ... driven by bass-heavy beats and haunting sounds.&quot; They changed their name to Triple Six Mafia, after a phrase Lord Infamous would use to refer to the group in their songs.

=== 1993–2005: Three 6 Mafia and debut solo album ===

In 1994, Triple Six Mafia were joined by Koopsta Knicca and released the underground album &quot;Smoked Out Loced Out&quot;. Later the group acquired two more members, Gangsta Boo and Crunchy Black and changed its name again to Three 6 Mafia. In 1995, they self-released their debut studio album, &quot;Mystic Stylez&quot;. Following the album&#x27;s success, Three 6 Mafia signed a major label deal with Relativity Records. They also started their own label Hypnotize Minds and signed a number of local artists, such as Project Pat, MC Mack, La Chat, Frayser Boy and Lil Wyte, among others. DJ Paul and Juicy J exclusively produced the whole albums by their artists, as well as Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s releases. The group achieved commercial success with their 2000 album, &quot;When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1&quot;, which debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was eventually certified platinum by RIAA.

In 2002, DJ Paul released his debut solo studio album &quot;Underground Volume 16: For da Summa&quot;. Most of the songs, originally featured on his 1994 mixtape &quot;Underground Volume 16: 4 Da Summa of &#x27;94&quot;, were remastered and some of the old featured artists were replaced with new ones from Hypnotize Minds, such as Frayser Boy and La Chat. The album peaked at number 127 at the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Three 6 Mafia released two more commercially successful albums: &quot;Da Unbreakables&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Most Known Unknown&quot; in 2005, both peaking in top five of &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. They also created the soundtracks of the movies &quot;Choices&quot; and its sequel &quot;Choices II: The Setup&quot;. By 2006, Paul and Juicy were the only members of the group left.

=== 2006–2012: Academy Award win, &quot;Scale-A-Ton&quot; and &quot;A Person of Interest&quot; ===

In 2006, DJ Paul, Juicy J, and Crunchy Black won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;It&#x27;s Hard out Here for a Pimp&quot; from the film &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot;. The song, which they co-wrote with HCP member Frayser Boy, was also ranked at number 80 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop&quot;.

After Three 6 Mafia released their 2008 album &quot;Last 2 Walk&quot;, the group had conflicts with their label Sony about their music style, which led DJ Paul and Juicy J to pursue other ventures and their solo careers.

In 2009, Paul released &quot;The Weigh In&quot; – his first mixtape since the &quot;Volume&quot; series in the early 1990s. A few months later he followed up with his second solo album &quot;Scale-A-Ton&quot;, released under Paul&#x27;s newly founded label Scale-A-Ton Entertainment. The album was received well by critics, earning a positive review and an &quot;Album pick&quot; by AllMusic. In 2010, Paul released his second mixtape &quot;Too Kill Again&quot;, hosted by DJ Scream and DJ Whoo Kid. The mixtape features many upcoming and new Memphis artists such as Lion Heart, Thug Therapy, Partee and Miscellaneous. DJ Paul stated the tape was a preview to his upcoming album, also titled &quot;Too Kill Again&quot;, which however was never released. Instead, in 2011, Paul made a new collaboration mixtape with rapper Ya Boy and producer Lil Lody, called &quot;Pray For Forgiveness&quot;. A few months later Paul released a retail No-DJ version with bonus songs to iTunes.

In 2012, Paul announced he was working on an experimental dub-hop EP called &quot;A Person of Interest&quot;. Later he changed it into a full featured album, which was released on October 22. &quot;A Person of Interest&quot; was packed with a bonus DVD, including a self-titled short movie, music videos and behind the scenes footage. Paul released videos for a number of songs from the album, including &quot;What I Look Like (W.I.L.L.)&quot;, &quot;Wit Tha Shit&quot;, &quot;Trap Back Jumpin&quot;, &quot;E&amp;J&quot; and a remix of &quot;I&#x27;m Dat Raw&quot; with Snow Tha Product. Paul called &quot;A Person of Interest&quot; his favorite solo album, stating that he loved the production and the &quot;raw&quot; sound of the album.

=== 2013–present: S.I.M., Da Mafia 6ix, The Killjoy Club, Master of Evil, etc. ===
In early 2013, DJ Paul focused on performing as a DJ, and created a DJ duo, called S.I.M. (Sex is Mandatory). The group created a number of live sets, as well as remixes to songs, such as Just Blaze &amp; Baauer&#x27;s &quot;Higher&quot;.

In late 2013, Paul and Lord Infamous were discussing creating a sequel to their 1993 album &quot;Come with Me 2 Hell&quot;, when the latter came with the idea to try and reunite the whole Three 6 Mafia crew. Infamous brought back Crunchy Black, Koopsta Knicca and Gangsta Boo, and the five of them reunited as &quot;Da Mafia 6ix&quot; with plans to release an album in 2014. On November 12, 2013, Da Mafia 6ix released their first mixtape &quot;6ix Commandments&quot;. The tape was almost entirely produced by DJ Paul and featured Yelawolf, 8Ball &amp; MJG, Krayzie Bone, Bizzy Bone, SpaceGhostPurrp and HCP affiliates Lil Wyte, Skinny Pimp and La Chat, among others. Juicy J and Project Pat also appeared as surprise guests on the posse song &quot;Body Parts&quot;, being credited just as &quot;&amp; more&quot; in the track listing.

DJ Paul collaborated on a mixtape titled &quot;Clash of da Titans&quot; with fellow Memphis producer Drumma Boy that was released on October 23, 2013, and on a free EP, called &quot;Black Fall&quot;, with rapper Yellawolf, which they put out for Halloween on October 31, 2013. On November 26, 2013, DJ Paul released &quot;Volume 16: The Original Masters&quot;, a remaster of his 1994 mixtape &quot;4 da Summer of &#x27;94&quot;. It was revealed on the PSYR17 EP given away at the 2014 Gathering of the Juggalos that DJ Paul plans to release his next solo album, &quot;Master of Evil&quot;, on Psychopathic Records in 2015. He later confirmed it himself on August 28 on The Australia underground hip hop podcast &quot;The Underground Podcast&quot;, as well as on the outro song to The Killjoy Club&#x27;s debut album &quot;Reindeer Games&quot;.

DJ Paul has been announced to play South by Southwest showcase in Austin, Texas on March 21, 2015.

On August 19, 2016, DJ Paul announced that he has signed to Yelawolf&#x27;s Slumerican Records. Upon signing with Slumerican, Paul released a two album series titled &quot;YOTS: Year of the Six&quot; parts 1 &amp; 2.

In 2017, he released the follow-up to his album &quot;Underground, Volume 16: For da Summa&quot; respectfully titled, &quot;Underground, Volume 17: For da Summa&quot; through his own Scale-A-Ton imprint. On September 2, 2018, Paul announced that he had begun working on the next volume in the &quot;Underground&quot; series titled &quot;Drackula: Vol. 18&quot;, which is said to be recorded in Castle Dracula in Transylvania. The project was originally scheduled to release sometime in 2018, but has since been pushed back to 2019.

== Personal life ==
Paul was born with Erb&#x27;s palsy, a condition which stunted the growth on his right arm. He often wears a cast while performing and doing interviews, jokingly calling it his &quot;baby arm.&quot; 

DJ Paul and Juicy J starred in MTV&#x27;s 2007 reality show &quot;Adventures in Hollyhood&quot;, which showed Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s move to Hollywood, California, following their Oscar win. The show also featured their personal assistants Computer and Big Triece, as well as Hypnotize Minds artists Project Pat and Lil Wyte. The series aired for eight episodes between April 5 and May 23, 2007.

In 2011, DJ Paul starred in VH1&#x27;s cooking show &quot;Famous Food&quot; together with seven other celebrities and eventually won first place. In an interview, Paul cleared up some controversy from the show, involving Ashley Dupre best known from the Eliot Spitzer scandal.

In a 2013 interview, Paul said he is getting three hours of sleep a day due to the amount of work he has to do in the variety of business ventures he has a part in. Describing his daily schedule, he said that he works with all of his companies during the day and records music during the night, stating that &quot;I feel like if I&#x27;m not working, then I&#x27;m losing and I&#x27;m not really giving my life what I should be giving.&quot;

On December 20, 2013, his half-brother, Lord Infamous, died from a heart attack at his mother&#x27;s house in Memphis, Tennessee.

DJ Paul is no longer engaged to Majda Baltic. They participated in an episode of Celebrity Wife Swap together with Plaxico Burress and his wife. They stated that they met at the Salt Lake City Airport.

=== Business ventures ===
In 2001, DJ Paul and the rest of Three 6 Mafia created the straight-to-video film &quot;Choices&quot;, followed by a sequel &quot;Choices II: The Setup&quot;, which was released in 2005. In 2007, DJ Paul and Juicy J started their own fashion wear line titled &quot;Dangerus / Skandulus&quot;. It was branded as the official Three 6 Mafia wear and includes T-shirts, hats, accessories and stickers. DJ Paul founded his own record label Scale-A-Ton Entertainment in 2009. He has released his last two albums under the label.

In 2012, DJ Paul launched a collection of BBQ seasonings called &quot;DJ Paul BBQ&quot;. Paul initially created a BBQ rub seasoning, soon followed by a Smoked Out BBQ Sauce. In 2013, DJ Paul became the official spokesman for a new legal version of the alcoholic drink Sizzurp. As of 2013, Paul also owns a real estate company.

=== Legal issues ===
In an interview with Power 105.1&#x27;s The Breakfast Club, Paul stated he has been arrested numerous times. He was sent to jail for the first time at the age of 17.

In 2006, a man from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, named Ramone Williams, filed a lawsuit against DJ Paul and other Three 6 Mafia members, claiming he has been severely beaten at a Three 6 Mafia concert when other fans followed the lyrics of the song &quot;Let&#x27;s Start a Riot&quot; and attacked him. The man claimed he was hit with a chair, kicked and stomped numerous times. Three 6 Mafia asked for dismissal of the suit on a summary judgment motion. In October 2006, both sides settled the suit and Williams received financial compensation.

On June 8, 2012, a lawsuit was filed against DJ Paul and Juicy J for failing to appear at a concert for which they were booked. The suit claimed the two were booked for an April 2011 show in Orlando, Florida but never showed up. They also never returned a $9,000 advance payment they received for the performance. Paul and Juicy were demanded to pay $50,000 for economic loss, out-of-pocket expenses and loss of income and revenue.

In October 2012, a few days before his third album was released, DJ Paul was arrested in New York when a Taser stun gun was found on him during a routine search. He was charged with a misdemeanor and released shortly after. Paul commented on the arrest: &quot;I honestly didn&#x27;t know it was illegal. I thought it was at the same level as pepper spray.&quot; Paul pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 21 hours of community service.

<doc id="287555" wikidata="Q1510587" url="?curid=287555" title="Pseudo-Riemannian manifold">
<text>In mathematical physics, a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, also called a semi-Riemannian manifold, is a differentiable manifold with a metric tensor that is everywhere nondegenerate. This is a generalization of a Riemannian manifold in which the requirement of positive-definiteness is relaxed. 

Every tangent space of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold is a pseudo-Euclidean vector space.

A special case used in general relativity is a four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold for modeling spacetime, where tangent vectors can be classified as timelike, null, and spacelike.

== Introduction ==

=== Manifolds ===

In differential geometry, a differentiable manifold is a space that is locally similar to a Euclidean space. In an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space any point can be specified by &quot;n&quot; real numbers. These are called the coordinates of the point.

An &quot;n&quot;-dimensional differentiable manifold is a generalisation of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space. In a manifold it may only be possible to define coordinates &quot;locally&quot;. This is achieved by defining coordinate patches: subsets of the manifold that can be mapped into &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space.

See &quot;Manifold&quot;, &quot;Differentiable manifold&quot;, &quot;Coordinate patch&quot; for more details.

=== Tangent spaces and metric tensors ===

Associated with each point formula_1 in an formula_2-dimensional differentiable manifold formula_3 is a tangent space (denoted formula_4). This is an formula_2-dimensional vector space whose elements can be thought of as equivalence classes of curves passing through the point formula_1.

A metric tensor is a non-degenerate, smooth, symmetric, bilinear map that assigns a real number to pairs of tangent vectors at each tangent space of the manifold. Denoting the metric tensor by formula_7 we can express this as 
: formula_8

The map is symmetric and bilinear so if formula_9 are tangent vectors at a point formula_1 to the manifold formula_3 then we have
* formula_12
* formula_13
for any real number formula_14.

That formula_7 is non-degenerate means there is no non-zero formula_16 such that formula_17 for all formula_18.

=== Metric signatures ===

Given a metric tensor &quot;g&quot; on an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real manifold, the quadratic form associated with the metric tensor applied to each vector of any orthogonal basis produces &quot;n&quot; real values. By Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia, the number of each positive, negative and zero values produced in this manner are invariants of the metric tensor, independent of the choice of orthogonal basis. The signature of the metric tensor gives these numbers, shown in the same order. A non-degenerate metric tensor has and the signature may be denoted , where .

== Definition ==

A pseudo-Riemannian manifold is a differentiable manifold &quot;M&quot; that is equipped with an everywhere non-degenerate, smooth, symmetric metric tensor &quot;g&quot;.

Such a metric is called a pseudo-Riemannian metric. Applied to a vector field, the resulting scalar field value at any point of the manifold can be positive, negative or zero.

The signature of a pseudo-Riemannian metric is , where both &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are non-negative. The non-degeneracy condition together with continuity implies that &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; remain unchanged throughout the manifold (assuming it is connected).

== Lorentzian manifold ==

A Lorentzian manifold is an important special case of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold in which the signature of the metric is (equivalently, ; see &quot;Sign convention&quot;). Such metrics are called Lorentzian metrics. They are named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz.

=== Applications in physics ===

After Riemannian manifolds, Lorentzian manifolds form the most important subclass of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. They are important in applications of general relativity.

A principal premise of general relativity is that spacetime can be modeled as a 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold of signature or, equivalently, . Unlike Riemannian manifolds with positive-definite metrics, an indefinite signature allows tangent vectors to be classified into &quot;timelike&quot;, &quot;null&quot; or &quot;spacelike&quot;. With a signature of or , the manifold is also locally (and possibly globally) time-orientable (see &quot;Causal structure&quot;).

== Properties of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds ==

Just as Euclidean space formula_19 can be thought of as the local model of a Riemannian manifold, Minkowski space formula_20 with the flat Minkowski metric is the local model of a Lorentzian manifold. Likewise, the model space for a pseudo-Riemannian manifold of signature (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) is pseudo-Euclidean space formula_21, for which there exist coordinates &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; such that
: formula_22

Some theorems of Riemannian geometry can be generalized to the pseudo-Riemannian case. In particular, the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry is true of all pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. This allows one to speak of the Levi-Civita connection on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold along with the associated curvature tensor. On the other hand, there are many theorems in Riemannian geometry that do not hold in the generalized case. For example, it is &quot;not&quot; true that every smooth manifold admits a pseudo-Riemannian metric of a given signature; there are certain topological obstructions. Furthermore, a submanifold does not always inherit the structure of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold; for example, the metric tensor becomes zero on any light-like curve. The Clifton–Pohl torus provides an example of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold that is compact but not complete, a combination of properties that the Hopf–Rinow theorem disallows for Riemannian manifolds.

<doc id="287557" wikidata="Q4844948" url="?curid=287557" title="Della Street">
<text>Della Street is the fictional secretary of Perry Mason in the long-running series of novels, short stories, films, and radio and television programs featuring the fictional defense attorney created by Erle Stanley Gardner.

In 1950, Gardner published the short story &quot;The Case of the Suspect Sweethearts&quot; under the pseudonym Della Street.

==Description==
===Original novels===
A character named Della Street first appeared in Gardner&#x27;s unpublished novel &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;, where she was a secretary, but not the secretary of the lawyer, Ed Stark. Gardner described her this way: &quot;Della Street … Secretary, twenty-seven, quiet, fast as hell on her feet, had been places. Worked in a carnival or side show, knows all the lines, hard-boiled exterior, quietly efficient, puzzled over the lawyer, chestnut hair, trim figure, some lines on her face, a hint of weariness at the corners of her eyes.&quot; When Gardner submitted &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; to William Morrow, an editor suggested that &quot;Della Street is a better character than the secretary.&quot; Gardner took this suggestion when he rewrote &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; as &quot;The Case of the Velvet Claws&quot; and made Della Street Perry Mason&#x27;s secretary. In the published novel, the carnival or side show was jettisoned, and Street came from a more &quot;respectable&quot; background.

&quot;The Case of the Velvet Claws&quot;, the first Perry Mason novel, was written in the early days of the Great Depression. In it, Della Street is revealed to have come from a wealthy, or at least well-to-do, family that was wiped out by the stock market crash of 1929. Della was forced to get a job as a secretary. By the time of the TV series in the 1950s and 1960s, this would not have fit well with the age of the characters as then portrayed. According to &quot;The Case of The Caretaker&#x27;s Cat&quot;, she is about 15 years younger than Perry Mason.

Several instances of sexual tension are seen between Mason and Street in the Gardner novels, multiple glances, kisses, and so on, and several proposals of marriage, all of which Della turned down because, at the time, wives of professional men did not work. Thus, she could not have continued as his secretary (and effective partner) and she did not want to give up this aspect of her life.

===Adaptations===
Gardner was disappointed by the initial set of Perry Mason films. One such change was how Street ended up married to Mason.

In the 2020 HBO adaptation, Della Street is a lesbian, living with her girlfriend.

==Origin==

Erle Stanley Gardner, the creator of Perry Mason in a series of novels, was a very prolific author, who simultaneously employed three secretaries—all sisters—to keep up with his output. One of them he eventually married, after his first wife—from whom he was separated for 30 years—died. This was Jean Gardner, born Agnes Helene Walter. People who knew her believed she was the inspiration for Della Street, though neither she nor Gardner himself admitted it. Mrs. Gardner said she thought he put several women together to create the character.

==Portrayals==
===Film===
In the film adaptations made in the 1930s, Della Street was portrayed by five different actresses: Helen Trenholme (&quot;The Case of the Howling Dog&quot;), Claire Dodd (&quot;The Case of the Curious Bride&quot; and &quot;The Case of the Velvet Claws&quot;), Genevieve Tobin (&quot;The Case of the Lucky Legs&quot;), June Travis (&quot;The Case of the Black Cat&quot;), and Ann Dvorak (&quot;The Case of the Stuttering Bishop&quot;).

===Radio===
Gertrude Warner was the first actress to portray Street regularly, albeit on the radio series. She was succeeded in the role by Joan Alexander, better known for portraying Lois Lane in the Superman radio series, and Jan Miner (Palmolive&#x27;s &quot;Madge&quot;). 

The character portrayed in the radio series was reworked into Sara Lane on the daytime show &quot;Edge of Night&quot;, which was to be the daytime Perry Mason series until Gardner pulled his support for the project.

===Television===
On television, Della Street was played by Barbara Hale in the series, for which she received an Emmy Award, and in the 30 made-for-TV movies. Sharon Acker played Della Street in the short-lived revival series &quot;The New Perry Mason&quot; starring Monte Markham as Mason.

In the HBO series, Della Street is portrayed by British actress Juliet Rylance.

<doc id="287560" wikidata="Q874006" url="?curid=287560" title="Publixtheatre Caravan">
<text>The Publixtheatre Caravan is the English name for a travelling project of the Volxtheater Favoriten, a Vienna-based international theatrical troupe that has been creating site-specific theatrical interventions in public space as well as stage-based performances since 1994. It is a political and artistic project that is part of the No Border Network and the Platform for a World Without Racism. It creates critical performance theatre that targets racism, borders, migration control, biometric data collection, and other forms of social control.

Since May 2001, the Publixtheatre Caravan has been creating international travelling informational, media, and artistic campaigns, to squat reality by directly interposing theater and artistic installations into everyday life.

The Volxtheater Favoriten is based out of the Ernst Kirchweger Haus (EKH), the former headquarters of the Austrian Communist Party in Vienna, a legalised squat that hosts migrants and refugees, community activities, and political groups. The Volxtheater has no permanent cast. There are no directors; the plays are developed communally during long discussions, with great disparity of views.

== Projects ==

The first production was a version of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; (autumn 1994 and September 1995), followed by the Greek play &quot;Penthesilea&quot; (March 1996), &quot;We can&#x27;t pay? We won&#x27;t pay&quot; (June-November 1996, &quot;Chor der Werkstätigen und Nichtwerkstätigen&quot; (Choir of the Working and the Not Working) (Winter 1996), &quot;EKHberet&quot; (January 1997) &quot;Theatercollagen&quot; (Theatre Collages) (March 28 and 29 1997), &quot;Der Auftrag&quot; (The Commission) (May/June and October 1997) and &quot;Schluss mit Lustig&quot; (No More Joking) (December 1999). &quot;Schluss mit Lustig&quot; was developed in reaction to the rise to power of Austria&#x27;s extreme right-wing Freedom Party, and premiered in the Vienna Schauspielhaus.

Since November 2002, the Caravan has been producing full-length video and musical performance play based on the book, &quot;Bukaka Spat Here,&quot; by Alexander Brener and Barbara Schurz.

In addition to full-length plays, the Volxtheater sees itself as an actionist group provoking political responsibility and moral courage by artistically intervening - spontaneously or planned - in public space, via street theatre and &quot;guerrilla fun&quot;.

A few of the street theatre actions of the Volxtheater include: crossing the Danube channel (spring 1995), army parade (October 26, 1995), matamorphile hexaphonium (spring 1996), demonstration against the government&#x27;s cuts on social payment (April 1996), street theatre during trials against people who signed an appeal to refuse to obey orders in the army (fete of Bewegung Rotes Wien in June 1996) Krems: performance of the play &quot;We can&#x27;t pay? We won&#x27;t pay!&quot; on the street (July 1996), &quot;Auf zur großen Grenzschutzaktion&quot; (Let&#x27;s Go for the Big Frontier Protection Action) (April 26, 1997). &quot;Spendenaufruf für die europäische Sicherheit&quot; (Call for Charity for European Safety) on the army parade (October 26, 1999).

In summer 2000 the idea emerged to form a caravan to advance the political actionism of the Publix Theatre. As a part of the &quot;cultural caravan through Carinthia and Styria&quot;, that held cultural events in villages and small towns in Carinthia and Styria and international resistance days in Klagenfurt, the caravan moved through Austria. The aim was to combine theatrical actions and information campaigns to enact change. The caravan left monuments with the inscription &quot;no border no nation - for an open carinthia, for an open Europe&quot; in its wake. The Publixtheatre caravans of 2001, 2002 and 2003 took this idea to an international level. Creating public theatrical interventions while dressed as UNO soldiers, police, border guards, and biometric researchers, the Publixtheatre has always provoked confusion as to whether they represent fiction or reality.

== Genoa Group of Eight Summit protest ==

After its participation in protests during the G8 summit in Genoa, 2001, the caravan was arrested in Italy. The 25 activists, journalists, and hitchhikers who were arrested there were kept in the custody of local police and then spent the next 3–4 weeks in the Voghera and Alessandria prisons in Italy before being deported and banned from re-entry. They were accused of being members of a &quot;criminal organisation&quot; that Italian authorities gave the name of the &quot;black bloc&quot; whose imputed goal was said to be &quot;devastation and looting&quot;. They were charged with property destruction, looting, and criminal association. The police evidence against them included their possession of black clothing, knives used to create a mobile street kitchen, as well as juggling clubs, poi, and other props.

<doc id="287567" wikidata="Q273030" url="?curid=287567" title="Haridwar">
<text>Haridwar (; ; formerly Mayapuri) is a city and municipal corporation in the Haridwar district of Uttarakhand, India. With a population of 228,832 in 2011, it is the second-largest city in the state and the largest in the district.

The city is situated on the right bank of the Ganges river, at the foothills of the Shivalik ranges. Haridwar lies in doab region where people speak khari boli, other districts of doab region lies in western Uttar Pradesh. Haridwar is regarded as a holy place for Hindus, hosting important religious events and serving as a gateway to several prominent places of worship. Most significant of the events is the Kumbha Mela, which is celebrated every 12 years in Haridwar. During the Haridwar Kumbh Mela, millions of pilgrims, devotees, and tourists congregate in Haridwar to perform ritualistic bathing on the banks of the Ganges to wash away their sins to attain &quot;moksha&quot;.

According to Puranic legend, Haridwar, along with Ujjain, Nashik, and Prayag, is one of four sites where drops of &quot;amrita&quot;, the elixir of immortality, accidentally spilled over from a &quot;kumbha&quot; (pitcher) while being carried by the celestial bird Garuda during the &quot;Samudra Manthana&quot;, or the churning of the ocean of milk. &quot;Brahma Kund&quot;, the spot where the amrita fell, is believed to be located at Har ki Pauri (literally, &quot;footsteps of the Lord&quot;) and is considered to be the most sacred &quot;ghat&quot; of Haridwar. It is also the primary centre of the Kanwar pilgrimage, in which millions of participants gather sacred water from the Ganges and carry it across hundreds of miles to dispense as offerings in Shiva shrines. Today, the city is developing beyond its religious importance with the fast-developing industrial estate of the State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand (SIDCUL), and the close by township of Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), as well as its affiliated ancillaries.

Haridwar presents a kaleidoscope of Indian culture and development. In sacred writings, it has been differently specified as Kapilsthan, Gangadwar and Mayapuri. It is additionally a passage for the Chota Char Dham (the four principal pilgrim destinations in Uttarakhand).

==Etymology==

The modern name of the town has two spellings: &quot;Haridwar and Hardwar&quot;. Each of these names has its own connotation.

In Sanskrit&quot;,&quot; the liturgical language of Hinduism, &quot;Hari&quot; means &quot;Vishnu&quot;, while &quot;dvāra means&quot; &quot;gateway&quot;. So, &quot;Haridwar&quot; translates to &quot;The Gateway to Vishnu&quot;. It earns this name because it is typically the place where pilgrim&#x27;s start their journey to visit a prominent temple of Vishnu – Badrinath.

Similarly, &quot;Hara&quot; could also mean &quot;Shiva&quot;. Hence, &quot;Hardwar&quot; could stand for &quot;Gateway to Shiva&quot;. Hardwar is also a typical place to start a pilgrim&#x27;s journey in order to reach Mount Kailash, Kedarnath, the northernmost Jyotirlinga and one of the sites of the smaller &quot;Char Dham&quot; pilgrimage circuit – all important places for worship for Hindus.

According to legend, it was in Haridwar that goddess Ganga descended when Shiva released the mighty river from the locks of his hair. The River Ganga, after flowing for from its source at Gaumukh at the edge of the Gangotri Glacier, enters the Gangetic Plain for the first time at Haridwar, which gave the city its ancient name, Gangadwára.
In the annotations to her poetical illustration &quot;Hurdwar, a Place of Hindoo Pilgrimage&quot;, Letitia Elizabeth Landon provides information on this name derivation, and also the story of the supposed origin of the &#x27;River Ganges&#x27;. The accompanying plate is engraved from a painting by Samuel Prout

==History==

In the scriptures, Haridwar has been variously mentioned as Kapilasthana, Gangadvāra and Mayapuri. It is also an entry point to the Char Dham (the four main centres of pilgrimage in Uttarakhand &quot;viz&quot;, Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri).

In the Vana Parva of the Mahabharata, where sage Dhaumya tells Yudhishthira about the tirthas of India, Gangadvāra, i.e., Haridwar and Kankhal, have been referred to, the text also mentions that Sage Agastya did penance (an act showing sorrow or regret for sin) here, with the help of his wife, Lopamudra (the princess of Vidharba).

Sage Kapila is said to have an ashram here giving it, its ancient name, Kapila or Kapilasthana.

The legendary king, Bhagiratha, the great-grandson of the Suryavamsha King Sagara (an ancestor of Rama), is said to have brought the river Ganges down from heaven, through years of penance in Satya Yuga, for the salvation of 60,000 of his ancestors from the curse of the Sage Kapila. This is a tradition continued by thousands of devout Hindus, who bring the ashes of their departed family members, in hope of their salvation. Vishnu is said to have left his footprint on the stone that is set in the upper wall of Har Ki Pauri, where the Ganges touches it at all times.

Haridwar came under the rule of the Maurya Empire (322–185 BCE), and later under the Kushan Empire (c. 1st–3rd centuries). Archaeological findings have proved that terra cotta culture dating between 1700 BCE and 1200 BCE existed in this region. First modern era written evidence of Haridwar is found in the accounts of a Chinese traveller, Huan Tsang, who visited India in 629 CE. during the reign of King Harshavardhana (590–647) records Haridwar as &#x27;Mo-yu-lo&#x27;, the remains of which still exist at Mayapur, a little to the south of the modern town. Among the ruins are a fort and three temples, decorated with broken stone sculptures, he also mentions the presence of a temple, north of Mo-yu-lo called &#x27;Gangadvara&#x27;, Gateway of the Ganges.

Haridwar came under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate in 1206.

The city also fell to the Central Asian conqueror Timur Lang (1336–1405) on 13 January 1399.

During his visit to Haridwar, first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak (1469–1539) bathed at &#x27;Kushawart Ghat&#x27;, wherein the famous, &#x27;watering the crops&#x27; episode took place, his visit is today commemorated by a gurudwara (Gurudwara Nanakwara), according to two Sikh Janamsakhis, this visit took place on the Baisakhi day in 1504 CE, he later also visited Kankhal en route to Kotdwara in Garhwal. Pandas of the Haridwar have been known to keep genealogy records of most of the Hindu population. Known as &quot;Vahis&quot;, these records are updated on each visit to the city, and are a repository of vast family trees of the family in North India.

In the 16th century, the city came under the rule of the Mughals. &quot;Ain-e-Akbari&quot;, written by Abul Fazal in the 16th century during the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar, refers to it as Maya (Mayapur), known as Hardwar on the Ganges&quot;, as seven sacred cities of Hindus. It further mentions it is eighteen kos (each approx. 2 km) in length, and large numbers of pilgrims assemble on the 10th of Chaitra. It also mentions that during his travels and also while at home, Mughal Emperor, Akbar drank water from the Ganges river, which he called &#x27;the water of immortality&#x27;. Special people were stationed at Sorun and later Haridwar to dispatch water, in sealed jars, to wherever he was stationed

During the Mughal period, there was mint for Akbar&#x27;s copper coinage at Haridwar. It is said that Raja Man Singh of Amber, laid that foundation of the present-day city of Haridwar and also renovated the ghats at Har Ki Pauri. After his death, his ashes are also said to have been immersed at Brahma Kund. Thomas Coryat, an English traveller, who visited the city in the reign of Emperor Jahangir (1596–1627) mentions it as &#x27;Haridwara&#x27;, the capital of Shiva.

Being one of the oldest living cities, Haridwar finds its mention in the ancient Hindu scriptures as it weaves through the life and time stretching from the period of the Buddha, to the more recent British advent. Haridwar has a rich and ancient religious and cultural heritage. It still has many old havelis and mansions bearing exquisite murals and intricate stonework.

One of the two major dams on the river Ganges, the Bhimgoda, is situated here. Built-in the 1840s, it diverts the waters of the Ganges to the Upper Ganges Canal, which irrigated the surrounding lands. Though this caused severe deterioration to the Ganges water flow, and is a major cause for the decay of the Ganges as an inland waterway, which till the 18th century was used heavily by the ships of the East India Company, and a town as high up as Tehri, was considered a port city The headworks of the Ganges Canal system is located in Haridwar. The Upper Ganges Canal was opened in 1854 after the work began in April 1842, prompted by the famine of 1837–38. The unique feature of the canal is the half-kilometre-long aqueduct over the Solani river at Roorkee, which raises the canal above the original river.
&#x27;Haridwar Union Municipality&#x27; was constituted in 1868, which included the then villages of Mayapur and Kankhal. Haridwar was first connected with railways, via Laksar, through branch line in 1886, when the Awadh and Rohilakhand Railway line was extended through Roorkee to Saharanpur, this was later extended to Dehradun in 1900.

In 1901, it had a population of 25,597 and was a part of the Roorkee tehsil, in Saharanpur district of the United Province, and remained so till the creation of Uttar Pradesh in 1947.

Haridwar has been an abode of the weary in body, mind, and spirit. It has also been a centre of attraction for learning various arts, science, and culture. The city has a long-standing position as a great source of Ayurvedic medicines and herbal remedies and is home to the unique Gurukul (school of traditional education), including the Gurukul Kangri Vishwavidyalaya, which has a vast campus, and has been providing traditional education of its own kind, since 1902. Development of Haridwar took an upturn in the 1960s, with the setting up of a temple of modern civilisation, BHEL, a &#x27;Maharatna PSU&#x27; in 1975, which brought along not just a its own township of BHEL, Ranipur, close to the existing Ranipur village, but also a set of ancillaries in the region. The University of Roorkee, now IIT Roorkee, is one of the oldest and most prestigious institutes of learning in the fields of science and engineering.

==Geography and climate==
The Ganges emerges from the mountains to touch the plains. The water in the river Ganges is mostly clear and generally cold, except in the monsoon, during which soil from the upper regions flows down into it.

The river Ganges flows in a series of channels separated from each other called aits, most of which are well wooded. Other minor seasonal streams are Ranipur Rao, Pathri Rao, Ravi Rao, Harnaui Rao, Begham Nadi etc. A large part of the district is forested, and Rajaji National Park is within the bounds of the district, making it an ideal destination for wildlife and adventure lovers. Rajaji is accessible through different gates; the Ramgarh Gate and Mohand Gate are within of Dehradun, while the Motichur, Ranipur and Chilla Gates are just about from Haridwar. Kunaon Gate is from Rishikesh, and Laldhang gate is from Kotdwara.

Haridwar district, covering an area of about , is in the southwestern part of Uttarakhand state of India.

Haridwar is situated at a height of from the sea level, between Shivalik Hills in the North and Northeast and the Ganges River in the South.

<doc id="287568" wikidata="Q766148" url="?curid=287568" title="Frappuccino">
<text>Frappuccino is a line of blended iced coffee drinks sold by Starbucks. It may consist of coffee or crème base, blended with ice and ingredients such as flavored syrups and usually topped with whipped cream and or spices. It may also include blended Starbucks refreshers. Frappuccinos are also sold as bottled coffee beverages in grocery stores, convenience stores and from vending machines.

==History==
Frappuccino is a portmanteau of &quot;&quot; (pronounced and also spelled without the accent)—the New England name for a thick milkshake with ice cream, derived from the French word (&quot;beaten milk&quot;)—and &quot;cappuccino&quot;, an espresso coffee with frothed milk.

The Frappuccino was originally developed, trademarked, and sold by George Howell&#x27;s Eastern Massachusetts coffee shop chain the Coffee Connection, and created and named by his marketing director, Andrew Frank. When Starbucks purchased the Coffee Connection in 1994, they gained the rights to use, make, market, and sell the Frappuccino drink. The drink, with a different recipe, was introduced under the Starbucks name in 1995. In 2012, Starbucks had annual Frappuccino sales of over $2 billion.

== Recipe ==
The recipe is derived from a fusion of various cold drinks, including the &quot;coffee frap&quot; (similar to iced coffee) and the &quot;frappe&quot; (blended ice cream, syrup, and milk), with the Italian cappuccino. The recipe consists of an instant coffee mix, ice, an emulsifying agent such as xanthan gum, and other additives such as milk, sugar, flavored syrups, and whipped cream.

==Versions==
===Currently available===
The following is a list of the typical versions available of each type of Frappuccino.

====Decaffeinated====
Upon consumer request, decaf espresso can be used in place of the standard instant coffee mix.

====Crème====
A coffee-free base was created to make a drink called a Frappuccino Blended Crème. Menu examples include the Mocha Crème, Vanilla Bean Crème, Strawberry Crème, Matcha Crème, and Chai Crème. All Frappuccino menu items can come as a Crème based Frappuccino, occasionally under slightly different names such as the Chocolate Cookie Crumble instead of the Mocha Cookie Crumble. Any syrup or sauce can be used to make a custom Frappuccino Blended Crème. Crème Frappuccinos contain very little or no caffeine.

====Non-dairy alternatives====
Frappuccinos made with soy milk became available in the United States and Canada in 2010. In January 2011, Starbucks introduced the option to Australian stores, and it has since been made available in other countries. Starbucks has also introduced coconut, almond, and oat milk options.

====Modifications====
Frappuccinos may include additional ingredients, which can include espresso shots, flavored syrups, &quot;Frappuccino chips&quot; (which are similar to chocolate chips), and flavored powders. Consumers may also customize the consistency of Frappuccinos by ordering light or extra ice. Any Frappuccino can have additional syrups, shots of espresso, or various other modifications at a possible surcharge. 

===Former===

====Juice blends====
In the summer of 2006, Starbucks introduced Frappuccino Juice Blends, which were described as being &quot;real fruit juices combined with Tazo Tea, blended with ice.&quot; Juice Blends were gradually discontinued throughout 2007 and 2008 and are no longer offered by Starbucks.

====Frappuccino Light====
Previously, Frappuccinos were orderable as &quot;light.&quot; The light Frappuccino was an alternative to the coffee Frappuccino, made using a low-sugar Frappuccino base and nonfat milk, and typically served without whipped cream. The light Frappuccino has now been discontinued.

====Seasonal Limited Editions====
Drinks such as the Unicorn, Frankenstein, Red Velvet Cake Cream, Cherry Blossom, and Zombie Frappuccinos were all seasonal limited edition offerings. The release of these Frappuccinos began in April 2017 and ran through 2018. Each Frappuccino was available only for a short period of time, as the ingredients were produced in relatively low quantities.

==Bottled Frappuccino==
Bottled Frappuccinos are sold in retail stores and vending machines. The bottled version was originally manufactured in 1996. Starbucks offers 19 different bottled Frappuccino flavors including Mocha, Vanilla, Coffee, Toasted White Chocolate Mocha, Pumpkin Spice, and Caramel. The bottled Frappuccino comes in two package sizes, including and .

==North American Coffee Partnership==
In 1994, PepsiCo and Starbucks formed an entity called the North American Coffee Partnership. The joint venture was created so that ready-to-drink products using the Starbucks name could be distributed using Pepsi&#x27;s global network. The Frappuccino was the joint venture&#x27;s first product.

==High sugar content==
The Frappuccino beverages contain a high level of added sugar. A typical grande (16oz) beverage has significantly more than the 36/32 grams of sugar that the American Heart Association suggests men/women should have in a day. For example, a grande Sugar Cookie Almondmilk Frappuccino contains 58 grams of sugar, a grande Matcha Creme Frappuccino has 61 grams, and a grande Pumpkin Spice Frappuccino has 65 grams.
