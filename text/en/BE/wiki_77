<text>Marc and the Mambas was a new wave group, formed by Marc Almond in 1982 as an offshoot project from Soft Cell. The band&#x27;s line-up changed frequently, and included Matt Johnson from and Annie Hogan, with whom Almond worked later in his solo career.

==History==
Marc and the Mambas marked the start of Marc Almond&#x27;s career outside of Soft Cell. In 1983, Almond and Soft Cell were very close to the avant-garde scene around Foetus, Psychic TV and Einstürzende Neubauten. Almond also took part as one of four members of The Immaculate Consumptive, a group initiated by Lydia Lunch; they never released any album but did a few shows in New York and Washington D.C. at the end of 1983. Further members were Jim Foetus and Nick Cave. Marc and the Mambas belonged to that scene, and continued the dark themes explored within Soft Cell, but musically used different instruments and more complex rhythms.

The group&#x27;s lineup was fluid, with members changing with each recording or performance; the only consistent members were Almond, Annie Hogan and Steve James Sherlock. Further members included Billy McGee and Martin McCarrick, who also later joined Almond when he formed Marc Almond and the Willing Sinners. Almond&#x27;s Soft Cell partner David Ball was an associated member for the Mambas&#x27; first single &quot;Sleaze&quot;, and Matt Johnson from was a member for the first and second album, but did not join for the last concerts in 1983 (put to vinyl and later to CD as &quot;Black, Bite &amp; Blues&quot;). Jim Foetus was an associated member, and did guest vocals and percussion on &quot;A Million Manias&quot; and &quot;Love Amongst the Ruined.&quot;

The Mambas&#x27; second Some Bizzare released album, &quot;Torment and Toreros&quot;, contained a mix of ballads, both with and without dance beats, and is a mix of vaudeville, French chanson, and goth sensibility, using guitar noise, piano, and string sections. Almond later described this recording as an &quot;attempted suicide put on vinyl.&quot;

===Post Mambas===
Almond has had a long career as a solo artist, and Mambas musicians have worked with him under the names The Willing Sinners and La Magia. Martin McCarrick left La Magia for Siouxsie and the Banshees in 1987, and the rest of that band dissolved in 1988. Lee Jenkinson (guitar) recorded a single with producer Flood under the band name The Poppyfields, and is currently in the band Jellynail. Almond always kept in touch with some of the Mambas&#x27; core members like Anne Stephenson and Gini Ball (David Ball&#x27;s ex-wife), who performed with him during his &quot;Sin, Songs And Romance&quot; gigs at the Almeida in 2004. He frequently includes Mambas songs in his live repertoire.

When Anohni from Antony and the Johnsons curated the Meltdown Festival in London in August 2012, one of the acts on the bill was Almond, who performed the album &quot;Torment and Toreros&quot; in its entirety. A few months prior to the performance, Almond stated on his webpage that &quot;Torment and Toreros&quot; &quot;wasn&#x27;t a great success at the time of release, it was mostly critically panned. It was called a &#x27;florid musical mess&#x27;, a description I quite liked&quot;, but added that &quot;In recent years it has been re-evaluated and re-appreciated as a (flawed) masterpiece, as I always hoped it would be. It is a dark album with themes of madness, depression, isolation, alienation, innocence lost and destructive love, all seen through a prism of fame. A nervous breakdown committed to vinyl&quot;.

<doc id="288681" wikidata="Q1254268" url="?curid=288681" title="Dragon Boat Festival">
<text>The Dragon Boat Festival () is a traditional Chinese holiday that occurs on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese calendar, which corresponds to late May or early June in the Gregorian calendar. The holiday commemorates Qu Yuan who was the beloved prime minister of the southern Chinese state of Chu during the Warring States period, about 600 B.C. to 200 B.C., and is celebrated by holding dragon boat races and eating sticky rice dumplings called &quot;zongzi&quot;, which were southern Chinese traditions. Dragon Boat Festival integrates praying for good luck and taking respite from the summer heat.

In September 2009, UNESCO officially approved the holiday&#x27;s inclusion in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, becoming the first Chinese holiday to be selected.

==Names==
The English language name for the holiday is &quot;Dragon Boat Festival&quot;, used as the official English translation of the holiday by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is also referred to in some English sources as Double Fifth Festival which alludes to the day of the festival according to the Chinese calendar.

The Chinese name of the festival is pronounced differently in different Chinese languages. &quot;Duanwu&quot; () literally means &#x27;starting five&#x27;—i.e., the first &quot;fifth day&quot; of the month according to the Chinese zodiac. However, despite the literal meaning referring to the Earthly Branches, this character has also become associated with , due to the characters often having the same pronunciation. Hence &quot;Duanwu&quot;, the festival on &quot;the fifth day of the fifth month&quot;.

In Cantonese, it is romanized as in Hong Kong and in Macau, hence the name &quot;Tuen Ng Festival&quot; used in Hong Kong, and ( in Portuguese) in Macau.

==History==
===Origin===
The fifth lunar month is considered an unlucky and poisonous month, and the fifth day of the fifth month especially so. To get rid of the misfortune, people would put calamus, Artemisia, and garlic above the doors on the fifth day of the fifth month. These were believed to help ward off evil by their strong smell and their shape (for instance, calamus leaves are shaped like swords).

Venomous animals were said to appear starting from the fifth day of the fifth month, such as snakes, centipedes, and scorpions; people also supposedly get sick easily after this day. Therefore, during the Dragon Boat Festival, people try to avoid this bad luck. For example, people may put pictures of the five venomous creatures (snake, centipede, scorpion, lizard, toad, and sometimes spider) on the wall and stick needles in them. People may also make paper cutouts of the five creatures and wrap them around the wrists of their children. Big ceremonies and performances developed from these practices in many areas, making the Dragon Boat Festival a day for getting rid of disease and bad luck.

===Qu Yuan===

The story best known in modern China holds that the festival commemorates the death of the poet and minister Qu Yuan (–278 BC) of the ancient state of Chu during the Warring States period of the Zhou dynasty. A cadet member of the Chu royal house, Qu served in high offices. However, when the king decided to ally with the increasingly powerful state of Qin, Qu was banished for opposing the alliance and even accused of treason. During his exile, Qu Yuan wrote a great deal of poetry. Eventually, Qin captured Ying, the Chu capital. In despair, Qu Yuan committed suicide by drowning himself in the Miluo River.

It is said that the local people, who admired him, raced out in their boats to save him, or at least retrieve his body. This is said to have been the origin of dragon boat races. When his body could not be found, they dropped balls of sticky rice into the river so that the fish would eat them instead of Qu Yuan&#x27;s body. This is said to be the origin of &quot;zongzi&quot;.

During the twentieth century, Qu Yuan became considered a patriotic poet and a symbol of the people. He was promoted as a folk hero and a symbol of Chinese nationalism in the People&#x27;s Republic of China after the 1949 Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War. The historian and writer Guo Moruo was influential in shaping this view of Qu.

===Wu Zixu===

Another origin story says that the festival commemorates Wu Zixu (died 484 BC), a statesman of the Kingdom of Wu. King Goujian of the state of Yue sends Xi Shi, a beautiful woman, to the state of Wu to distract its King Fuchai from state affairs. Wu Zixu sees through the plot and warned Fuchai, who became angry and forced the latter to commit suicide. His body was thrown into the river on the fifth day of the fifth month. After his death, in places such as Suzhou, Wu Zixu is remembered during the Dragon Boat Festival.

===Cao E===
Although Wu Zixu is commemorated in southeast Jiangsu and Qu Yuan elsewhere in China, much of Northeastern Zhejiang, including the cities of Shaoxing, Ningbo and Zhoushan, celebrates the memory of the young girl Cao E (130–144 AD) instead. Cao E&#x27;s father Cao Xu () was a shaman who presided over local ceremonies at Shangyu. In 143, while presiding over a ceremony commemorating Wu Zixu during the Dragon Boat Festival, Cao Xu accidentally fell into the Shun River. Cao E, in an act of filial piety, searched the river for 3 days trying to find him. After five days, she and her father were both found dead in the river from drowning. Eight years later, in 151, a temple was built in Shangyu dedicated to the memory of Cao E and her sacrifice. The Shun River was renamed Cao&#x27;e River in her honor. Cao E is depicted in the &quot;Wu Shuang Pu&quot; (&quot;Table of Peerless Heroes&quot;) by Jin Guliang.

===Pre-existing holiday===
Some modern research suggests that the stories of Qu Yuan or Wu Zixu were possibly superimposed onto pre-existing holiday traditions. The promotion of these stories might have been encouraged by Confucian scholars, seeking to legitimize and strengthen their influence in China. The relationship between zongzi, Qu Yuan and the Dragon Boat Festival first appeared during the early Han dynasty.

The stories of both Qu Yuan and Wu Zixu were recorded in Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Shiji&quot;, completed 187 and 393 years after the respective events, because historians wanted to praise both characters.

According to some, the holiday may have originated as a celebration of agriculture, fertility, and rice growing in southern China. As recently as 1952 the American sociologist Wolfram Eberhard wrote that it was more widely celebrated in southern China than in the north.

Another theory is that the Dragon Boat Festival originated from dragon worship. This theory was advanced by Wen Yiduo. Support is drawn from two key traditions of the festival: the tradition of dragon boat racing and &quot;zongzi&quot;. The food may have originally represented an offering to the dragon king, while dragon boat racing naturally reflects a reverence for the dragon and the active &quot;yang&quot; energy associated with it. This was merged with the tradition of visiting friends and family on boats.

Another suggestion is that the festival celebrates a widespread feature of east Asian agrarian societies: the harvest of winter wheat. Offerings were regularly made to deities and spirits at such times: in the ancient Yue, dragon kings; in the ancient Chu, Qu Yuan; in the ancient Wu, Wu Zixu (as a river god); in ancient Korea, mountain gods (see Dano). As interactions between different regions increased, these similar festivals eventually merged into one holiday.

===Early 20th century===
In the early 20th century the Dragon Boat Festival was observed from the first to the fifth days of the fifth month, and was also known as the Festival of Five Poisonous/Venomous Insects ().
Yu Der Ling writes in chapter 11 of her 1911 memoir &quot;Two Years in the Forbidden City&quot;:

The first day of the fifth moon was a busy day for us all, as from the first to the fifth of the fifth moon was the festival of five poisonous insects, which I will explain later—also called the Dragon Boat Festival... Now about this Feast. It is also called the Dragon Boat Feast. The fifth of the fifth moon at noon was the most poisonous hour for the poisonous insects, and reptiles such as frogs, lizards, snakes, hide in the mud, for that hour they are paralyzed. Some medical men search for them at that hour and place them in jars, and when they are dried, sometimes use them as medicine. Her Majesty told me this, so that day I went all over everywhere and dug into the ground, but found nothing.
===21st century===
In 2008 the Dragon Boat Festival was made a national public holiday in China.

==Public holiday==

The festival was long marked as a cultural festival in China and is a public holiday in China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. The People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s government established in 1949 did not initially recognize the Dragon Boat Festival as a public holiday but reintroduced it in 2008 alongside two other festivals in a bid to boost traditional culture.

The Dragon Boat Festival is unofficially observed by the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia, including Singapore and Malaysia. Equivalent and related official festivals include the Korean Dano, Japanese &quot;Tango no sekku&quot;, and Vietnamese Tết Đoan Ngọ.

==Practices and activities==
Three of the most widespread activities conducted during the Dragon Boat Festival are eating (and preparing) &quot;zongzi&quot;, drinking realgar wine, and racing dragon boats.

===Dragon boat racing===

Dragon boat racing has a rich history of ancient ceremonial and ritualistic traditions, which originated in southern central China more than 2500 years ago. The legend starts with the story of Qu Yuan, who was a minister in one of the Warring State governments, Chu. He was slandered by jealous government officials and banished by the king. Out of disappointment in the Chu monarch, he drowned himself in the Miluo River. The common people rushed to the water and tried to recover his body, but they failed. In commemoration of Qu Yuan, people hold dragon boat races yearly on the day of his death according to the legend. They also scattered rice into the water to feed the fish, to prevent them from eating Qu Yuan&#x27;s body, which is one of the origins of &quot;zongzi&quot;.
===Zongzi (traditional Chinese rice dumplings)===

A notable part of celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival is making and eating zongzi, also known as sticky rice dumplings, with family members and friends. People traditionally make zongzi by wrapping glutinous rice and fillings in leaves of reed or bamboo, forming a pyramid shape. The leaves also give a special aroma and flavor to the sticky rice and fillings. Choices of fillings vary depending on regions. Northern regions in China prefer sweet or dessert-styled zongzi, with bean paste, jujube, and nuts as fillings. Southern regions in China prefer savory zongzi, with a variety of fillings including eggs and meat.

Zongzi appeared before the Spring and Autumn period and were originally used to worship ancestors and gods. In the Jin dynasty, zongzi dumplings were officially designated as the Dragon Boat Festival food. At this time, in addition to glutinous rice, the Chinese medicine &quot;yizhiren&quot; (&quot;Alpinia oxyphylla&quot;) was added to the ingredients for making zongzi. This cooked zongzi is called &quot;yizhi zong&quot;.

===Food related to 5===
&#x27;Wu&#x27; (午) in the name &#x27;Duanwu&#x27; has a pronunciation similar to that of the number 5 in multiple Chinese dialects, and thus many regions have traditions of eating food that is related to the number 5. For example, the Guangdong and Hong Kong regions have the tradition of having congee made from 5 different beans.

===Realgar wine===
Realgar wine or Xionghuang wine is a Chinese alcoholic drink that is made from Chinese liquor dosed with powdered realgar, a yellow-orange arsenic sulfide mineral. It was traditionally used as a pesticide, and as a common antidote against disease and venom. On the Dragon Boat Festival, people may put realgar wine on parts of children&#x27;s faces to repel the five poisonous creatures.

===5-colored silk-threaded braid===
In some regions of China, people, especially children, wear silk ribbons or threads of 5 colors (blue, red, yellow, white, and black, representing the five elements) on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival. People believe that this will help keep evil away.

Other common activities include hanging up icons of Zhong Kui (a mythic guardian figure), hanging mugwort and calamus, taking long walks, and wearing perfumed medicine bags. Other traditional activities include a game of making an egg stand at noon (this &quot;game&quot; implies that if someone succeeds in making the egg stand at exactly 12:00 noon, that person will receive luck for the next year), and writing spells. All of these activities, together with the drinking of realgar wine or water, were regarded by the ancients (and some today) as effective in preventing disease or evil while promoting health and well-being.

In the early years of the Republic of China, Duanwu was celebrated as the &quot;Poets&#x27; Day&quot; due to Qu Yuan&#x27;s status as China&#x27;s first known poet. In Taiwanese tradition, balancing an egg on Duanwu is said to bring good fortune for the rest of the year.

The sun is considered to be at its strongest around the time of the summer solstice, as the daylight in the northern hemisphere is the longest. The sun, like the Chinese dragon, traditionally represents masculine energy, whereas the moon, like the phoenix, traditionally represents feminine energy. The summer solstice is considered the annual peak of male energy while the winter solstice, the longest night of the year, represents the annual peak of feminine energy. The masculine image of the dragon has thus become associated with the Dragon Boat Festival.

<doc id="288688" wikidata="Q6781982" url="?curid=288688" title="María Elena Salinas">
<text>María Elena Salinas (born December 30, 1954) is an American broadcast journalist, news anchor and author. Called the &quot;Voice of Hispanic America&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Salinas is one of the most recognized Hispanic female journalists in the United States. She was the co-anchor of &quot;Noticiero Univision,&quot; the primary evening news broadcast on Univision, and the co-host of the news magazine program &quot;Aquí y Ahora&quot; (&quot;Here and Now&quot;).

Salinas has been working for more than three decades in the United States and in 18 Latin American countries. She has interviewed Latin American heads of state, rebel leaders, dictators, and every United States president since Jimmy Carter.

==Journalism career==

Salinas began as a reporter, anchor and public-affairs host for KMEX-TV, the Univision affiliate in Los Angeles, in 1981. She became the anchor of the national Spanish-language news program &quot;Noticiero Univision&quot; in 1987.

She has interviewed figures such as former US Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama; Manuel Noriega, the former military dictator of Panama; Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega; and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation spokesman Subcomandante Marcos. She has also interviewed celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan.

Salinas was among the first female journalists in wartime Baghdad. She herself has been interviewed by Katie Couric Bill Moyers, and others.

Salinas participated in the bilingual national Democratic presidential candidate debate on Hispanic issues in 2004, and again in 2007 co-hosting the first Democratic and Republican presidential candidate forums in Spanish on the Univision Network.

From 2001 to 2011, she wrote a weekly syndicated column in English and Spanish. In 2017–18, she hosted two seasons of the English-language crime program &quot;The Real Story with María Elena Salinas&quot;, on Investigation Discovery.

On August 3, 2017, Univision announced that Salinas would be leaving her post as co-anchor of &quot;Noticiero Univisión&quot; at the end of 2017. In a Facebook post, Salinas said she plans to become an independent news producer and that she was not pushed out.

On July 1, 2018, she participated in Telemundo&#x27;s Mexican presidential elections coverage and on December 1, exactly five months later, she was part of Telemundo&#x27;s news team covering the Mexican presidential inauguration from Mexico City.

On July 22, 2019, CBS News announced Maria Elena Salinas would be joining as a contributor. María Elena Salinas joined &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; to break down the diverse Latino communities across the U.S. that were long held as a single voting bloc, but economic, geographic and cultural differences show stark divides in how Latino Americans have cast their ballots in the 2020 United States presidential election.

In March 2022, Maria Elena Salinas became a contributor for ABC News 

==Public service and philanthropy==

For almost twenty years Salinas has volunteered for the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, which encourages immigrants to vote and otherwise participate in politics; she is the spokesperson for its &quot;Ya Es Hora&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s Time&quot;) program.

Salinas is a founder of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists and was inducted into its Hall of Fame in 2006. She also sponsors the Maria Elena Salinas Scholarship for college students interested in Spanish news broadcasting.

She is on the boards of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund and the International Women&#x27;s Media Foundation.

==Awards and recognition==
Salinas has won numerous awards and distinctions for both her journalism and philanthropic work.

Salinas won a 2014 Peabody Award, Walter Cronkite Award and Gracie Award for her news and documentary special &quot;Entre el abandono y el rechazo&quot; (Between Abandonment and Rejection), a prime-time report on the exodus of Central American children to the United States, which judges praised as &quot;balanced and revealing.&quot;

In 2014, she won the Broadcast Legend Award from the Radio and Television News Association of Southern California. In 2012, with her co-anchor Jorge Ramos, she received an Emmy Award for Lifetime Achievement from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. In 2013, Broadcasting &amp; Cable and Multichannel News presented Salinas with the Award for Outstanding Achievement at the 11th Annual Hispanic Television Summit, produced by Schramm Marketing Group. Earlier in her career, Salinas was part of the Univision News team that received the Edward R. Murrow Award for the network&#x27;s coverage of the Atlanta Olympic Park bombings in 1996.

For her philanthropic work, Salinas is a recipient of the Intrepid Award from the National Organization for Women, and has been honored by organizations including the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, among others.

In 2017, Salinas was a commencement speaker at American University and California State University, Fullerton and received an honorary doctorate from American University. She was presented with the Leading Ladies of Entertainment accolade by the Latin Recording Academy in 2020.

==Personal life==
Salinas&#x27;s parents immigrated to the United States from Mexico in the 1940s. She was born in Los Angeles in 1954. As a child, she lived in Mexico for 7 years. Since 1991, Salinas has lived in Miami with her 2 daughters, Julia Alexandra and Gabriela Maria.

Salinas&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Yo Soy la Hija de mi Padre&quot; (&quot;I Am my Father&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, 2006) covers her discovery that her father had once been a Catholic priest.

<doc id="288692" wikidata="Q121765" url="?curid=288692" title="Astoria, Queens">
<text>Astoria is a neighborhood in the western portion of the New York City borough of Queens. Astoria is bounded by the East River and is adjacent to four other Queens neighborhoods: Long Island City to the southwest, Sunnyside to the southeast, and Woodside and East Elmhurst to the east. , Astoria has an estimated population of 95,446.

Originally the site of a War of 1812 fortification, a village called Hallet&#x27;s (or Hallett&#x27;s) Cove after its first landowner William Hallet, who settled there in 1652 with his wife, Elizabeth Fones grew around the fort. Hallet&#x27;s Cove was incorporated on April 12, 1839, and was later renamed for John Jacob Astor, then the wealthiest man in the United States, in order to persuade him to invest in the area. During the second half of the 19th century, economic and commercial growth brought increased immigration. Astoria and several other surrounding villages were incorporated into Long Island City in 1870, which in turn was incorporated into the City of Greater New York in 1898. Commercial activity continued through the 20th century, with the area being a center for filmmaking and industry.

Astoria is colloquially referred to by several nicknames: &quot;Actoria&quot; highlighting the neighborhood&#x27;s significant population of actors, drawn by its proximity to the Kaufman Astoria Studios, Silvercup Studios, and the Theater District; &quot;The People&#x27;s Republic of Astoria,&quot; referencing the neighborhood&#x27;s reputation as a progressive political hub - as of 2023, it became the only district in the United States to elect Democratic Socialists of America representatives at municipal, state, and federal levels; and &quot;The Big Apple’s Fruit Basket&quot; due to the thousands of fruit trees, particularly fig trees, cultivated in local yards.

Astoria is located in Queens Community District 1 and its ZIP Codes are 11101, 11102, 11103, 11105, and 11106. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 114th Precinct. Fire protection is provided by Battalions 45 and 49 of FDNY. Politically, Astoria is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 22nd and 26th Districts.

==History==
=== Early settlement ===
The area now known as Astoria was originally called Hallet&#x27;s Cove (also spelled Hallett&#x27;s Cove), after its first landowner William Hallet, (or Hallett) who settled there in 1652 with his wife, Elizabeth Fones, though they moved to Flushing after their farm was destroyed by Native Americans. The peninsula was bordered to the north by Hell Gate, to the west by the East River, and the south by Sunswick Creek. Hallet bought the land in 1664 from two native chiefs named Shawestcont and Erramorhar.

In 1814 the area of Hallet&#x27;s point became the site of Fort Stevens, a defensive work to protect Hell Gate from a potential British attack during the War of 1812. The coastal fort also had an inland defensive position, Castle Bogardus, to protect from a land attack. Together these structures where the first permanent buildings in what would become Astoria. By 1815 the fort would be abandoned, but by 1836 a small village of 20 to 30 dwellings and an Episcopalian church was built, naming itself the aforementioned Hallet&#x27;s Cove. 

Beginning in the early 19th century, affluent New Yorkers constructed large residences around 12th and 14th Streets, an area that later became known as Astoria Village (now Old Astoria). Hallet&#x27;s Cove, incorporated on April 12, 1839, and previously founded by fur merchant Stephen A. Halsey, was a noted recreational destination and resort for Manhattan&#x27;s wealthy.

The area was renamed for John Jacob Astor, then the wealthiest man in the United States with a net worth of more than $40 million, in order to persuade him to invest in the neighborhood. He only invested $500, but the name stayed nonetheless, as a bitter battle over naming the village finally was won by Astor&#x27;s supporters and friends. From Astor&#x27;s summer home in Yorkville, Manhattan—on what is now East 87th Street near York Avenue—he could see across the East River the new Long Island village named in his honor. Astor, however, never actually set foot in Astoria.

=== Economic development ===
During the second half of the 19th century, economic and commercial growth brought increased immigration from German settlers, mostly furniture and cabinet makers. One such settler was Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg, patriarch of the Steinway family who founded the piano company Steinway &amp; Sons in 1853, which today is a worldwide piano company. Later on, the Steinways built a sawmill and foundry, as well as a streetcar line. The family eventually established Steinway Village for their workers, a company town that provided school instruction in German as well as English. Part of the motivation for locating the Steinway factory in Queens was to keep the workers isolated from the ferment of labor organizing and radicalism occurring in other parts of New York, notably the Lower East Side.

Astoria and several other surrounding villages, including Steinway, were incorporated into Long Island City in 1870. Long Island City remained an independent municipality until it was incorporated into the City of Greater New York in 1898. The area&#x27;s farms were turned into housing tracts and street grids to accommodate the growing number of residents.

Astoria also figured prominently in early American filmmaking as one of its initial centers. That heritage is preserved today by the Museum of the Moving Image and Kaufman Astoria Studios.

==Demographics==
For census purposes, the New York City government classifies Astoria as part of three neighborhood tabulation areas: Steinway (north of Grand Central Parkway), Old Astoria (north of 31st Avenue and approximately west of 31st Street), and Astoria (in the remaining area approximately north of Northern Boulevard / 36th Avenue and approximately west of Hobart Street / 50th Street). Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the combined population of these areas was 154,141, a decrease of 17,427 (10.2%) from the 171,568 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 52.2% (80,533) Non-Hispanic White, 4.7% (7,204) black, 0.2% (250) Native American, 14.3% (22,100) Asian, 0.0% (70) Pacific Islander, 1.0% (1,532) from other races, and 2.1% (3,238) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 25.4% (39,214) of the population. The Astoria and Old Astoria tabulation areas had greater Hispanic / Latino and Asian populations, and the Old Astoria area specifically had a greater Black population.

The racial and ethnic composition of Astoria changed significantly from 2000 to 2010. The most significant changes were the decrease in the Other population by 64% (8,919) and the decrease in the Hispanic / Latino population by 13% (5,705). The White majority also decreased by 2% (1,699), while the Asian minority decreased by 5% (1,120), and the change in the small Black population rounded to 0% (11). Taking into account the three census tabulation areas, the White and Asian populations both actually increased in Old Astoria, but decreased enough in Astoria and Steinway to cause an overall decrease; on the other hand, the Black population decreased in Old Astoria and increased equivalently in the other regions. The decreases in the Hispanic / Latino population and in racial groups, however, were relatively even across the three areas.

The entirety of Queens Community District 1, which includes Astoria and parts of Long Island City, is bounded to the east approximately by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and 81st Street, and to the south approximately by Queens Plaza and Northern Boulevard. It had 199,969 residents according to NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 83.4 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 16% are between the ages of 0–17, 41% between 25 and 44, and 22% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 12% respectively.

, the median household income in Community District 1 was $67,444. In 2018, an estimated 18% of Astoria residents lived in poverty, compared to 19% in all of Queens and 20% in all of New York City. Around 8% of residents were unemployed, compared to 8% in Queens and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 47% in Astoria, slightly lower than the boroughwide and citywide rates of 53% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Community District 1 is considered to be gentrifying: according to the Community Health Profile, the district was low-income in 1990 and has seen above-median rent growth up to 2010.

===Ethnic groups===
==== Early populations ====
Astoria was first settled by the Dutch, English, and Germans in the 17th century. Many Irish settled in the area during the waves of Irish immigration into New York City during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Italians were the next significant immigrants in Astoria, and numerous Italian restaurants, delis, bakeries, and pizza shops are found throughout Astoria, particularly in the Ditmars Boulevard area.

Jews were also a significant ethnic and religious group. The Astoria Center of Israel, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was built in 1925 after outgrowing the former Congregation Mishkan Israel, which was built in 1904.

==== Later populations ====
The 1960s saw a large increase of Greeks, and after 1974, there was an influx of Cypriots. This cultural imprint can be seen in the numerous Greek restaurants, tavernas, bakeries, and cafes, as well as several Greek Orthodox churches. In the late 1960s, a &#x27;Greek Town&#x27; neighborhood coalesced in Astoria. From 1960s to 1980s the number of Greeks constantly increased. While the population of Greeks in Astoria was 22,579 in 1980, it dropped to 18,127 by 1990 due to decreased immigration and lower birth rates. During the 2000s, the Greek immigration dropped again. During the 2010s and 2020s economic issues in Greece caused a resurgence of Greek immigration. Greek organizations in the area include the Hellenic American Action Committee (HANAC) and the Federation of Hellenic Societies of Greater New York.

Most of the 20,000 Maltese in New York City live in Astoria, and although this population has steadily been emigrating from the area, there are still many Maltese, supported by the Maltese Center of New York.

Beginning in the mid-1970s, the neighborhood&#x27;s Muslim population grew from earlier immigrants from Lebanon to also include people from Kosovo, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria. In the 1990s, Steinway Street between 28th Avenue and Astoria Boulevard saw the establishment of many Arabic shops, restaurants, and cafes, which is unofficially called &quot;Little Egypt&quot;, due to the number of Arabs residing there and the mostly Egyptian shops and lounges there.

Croatians from Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina have been numerous since the 1960s and their numbers continue to grow. New populations of South American and Balkan peoples have seen significant growth since the early 1990s, including a large population of Brazilians, who reside in the 36th Avenue area. Albanians, Bulgarians, Serbs, and Bosnians have also shown a rise in numbers. Many Spanish Americans live in Astoria, with most of them being of Galician heritage from Northwestern Spain; this community is supported by the Casa Galicia (Galicia House) and the Circulo Español (Spanish Circle).

At one time, many Bangladeshi Americans settled in Astoria, but by 2001, many of them had moved to Metro Detroit. A survey of an Astoria-area Bengali language newspaper estimated that, in an 18-month period until March 2001, 8,000 Bangladeshi people moved to the Detroit area. However, as of 2010, the Bangladeshi American community in Astoria has been increasing.

By the early 21st century, Astoria was one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in Queens, with people from around 100 countries residing there . Population losses in Queens were particularly high in immigrant neighborhoods such as Astoria, which suffered the greatest population loss in the city, losing more than 10,000 residents between the years 2000 and 2010.

==Geography==
There is some debate as to what constitutes the geographic boundaries of Astoria. The neighborhood was part of Long Island City prior to the latter&#x27;s incorporation into the City of Greater New York in 1898.

The area south of Astoria was called Ravenswood, and traditionally, Broadway was considered the border between the two. Today, however, many residents and businesses south of Broadway identify themselves as Astorians for convenience or status, since Long Island City has historically been considered an industrial area, and Ravenswood is now mostly a low-income neighborhood. Some of the thoroughfares have lent their names to unofficial terms for the areas they serve. For instance, the eastern end of Astoria, with Steinway Street as its main thoroughfare, is sometimes referred to simply as &quot;Steinway&quot;, and the northern end around Ditmars Boulevard is sometimes referred to as &quot;Ditmars&quot;, with their convergence point bearing the neighborhood name &quot;Ditmars-Steinway&quot;. Banners displayed on lamp posts along 30th Avenue refer to it as &quot;the Heart of Astoria&quot;.

===Ravenswood===
Ravenswood is the name for the strip of land bordering the East River and Long Island City, and is part of Astoria. The etymology of Ravenswood may have been for the population of ravens, or a character from The Bride of Lammermoor. It was situated around Sunswick Creek, which drained into the East River at the current location of Socrates Sculpture Park.

The land was acquired in 1814 by Col. George Gibbs, a businessman from New York City who developed it. Gibbs died in 1833, and the land was divided into nine parcels by three developers. From 1848, there were several mansions built on this land, but the high class housing did not survive. The spring of 1853 brought the opening of a post office of its own and country store &quot;run by Messrs. Moore &amp; Luyster, and Mr. Samuel H. Moore of that firm received the appointment of postmaster, handling the mails in a corner of the store.&quot;

Ravenswood, unlike Astoria, never became a village; there was no disposition at any time to become independent as there was insufficient population or commercial activity to justify such a move. Ravenswood remained an exclusive hamlet within the Town of Newtown until its absorption with the Village of Astoria and the hamlets of Hunters Point, Blissville, Sunnyside, Dutch Kills, Steinway, Bowery Bay and Middleton in Newtown Township into Long Island City in 1870. In 1870, Ravenswood, along with several other hamlets and the Village of Astoria, merged to form Long Island City.

In 1875, the first commercial buildings were erected, and the mansions were converted into offices and boarding houses. In 1879, the Long Island Terra Cotta Company was established in Ravenswood, by Rudolph Franke. By 1900, Ravenswood was heavily commercial, and remains so to this day. However, the name has retained its residential character through the New York City Housing Authority project that was built in 1949 to 1951 with this name between 34th and 36th Avenues, and 12th and 24th Streets.

The name also identifies the large electric power station established along the shore of the East River, just south of the Roosevelt Island Bridge. The Ravenswood Generating Station which includes Ravenswood No. 3 or &quot;Big Allis&quot;, was built by Con Edison in 1963–65 but, due to deregulation, has subsequently been owned by KeySpan, National Grid, and TransCanada. The power plant can generate approximately 2,500 megawatts of power, which is about 20 percent of New York City&#x27;s electricity demand.

===Ditmars===
Ditmars is a middle class section of Astoria bounded by Bowery Bay to the north, 31st Street and the Steinway subsection to the east, 23rd Avenue to the south, and the East River to the west. The adjacent Steinway neighborhood was largely developed as a company town by the Steinway &amp; Sons piano company, and included houses and public facilities that were also available to non-employees. However, the Ditmars neighborhood was not included in the Steinway &amp; Sons company housing and related facilities project. The neighborhood takes its name from Ditmars Boulevard which was named in honor of Abram Ditmars, the first mayor of Long Island City, New York, elected in 1870 (the city became a mere neighborhood when Queens became a part of Greater New York). His ancestors were German immigrants who settled in the Dutch Kills area in the 1600s.

===Astoria Heights===
Astoria Heights, or Upper Ditmars (part of East Elmhurst), is bounded by Hazen Street to the west, La Guardia Airport to the east, Bowery Bay to the north, and Astoria Boulevard and the Grand Central Parkway to the south. It is mostly a quiet middle class neighborhood of one- and two-family private homes.

The Riker-Lent Homestead is near the north end of Astoria Heights at 7803 19th Road. Built around 1655 by Abraham Riker under a patent from Nieuw Nederland&#x27;s last governor, Peter Stuyvesant, it is believed to be the oldest remaining dwelling in New York City still used as a residence. There is an adjacent family cemetery. The Smiths, who bought the house in 1975, have been restoring it for many years. The annual public tour was given usually in mid-September by the owners for the benefit of a local historical society, but has since ceased to occur.

Before Prohibition, there were dance halls, picnic areas, and amusement park rides at North Beach.

Ragtime composer Scott Joplin is buried across the Grand Central Parkway at St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery, which occasionally holds ragtime concerts.

The Rikers Island Bridge to New York City&#x27;s main prison, Rikers Island, runs from the north end of Hazen Street. Technically, Rikers Island is in the Bronx since New York City took it over from Long Island City in 1884, after it had annexed the South Bronx but before it consolidated Queens. However, like Astoria Heights, Rikers Island gets its mail from the East Elmhurst (ZIP Code 11370) station of the Flushing Post Office.

<text>Kalaripayattu (; also known simply as Kalari) is an Indian martial art that originated in Kerala, a state on the southwestern coast of India, around 2,000 years ago, dating back to the 3rd century BCE.

Presently, the Government of Kerala organizes an annual Kalaripayattu combat event known as &#x27;Ponnyathankam&#x27; every February. Practitioners from Kalaris across Kerala gather at the historic Ankathattu, an amphitheater reminiscent of a Colosseum, located in Ezharakkandam, Thalassery, where the last recorded Ankam (duel) took place in the 17th century. The event serves as a platform for Kalaripayattu practitioners to engage in traditional combat, preserving the martial art’s heritage and competitive spirit.

== Etymology ==
Kalaripayattu is a martial art which developed out of combat-techniques of the 11th-12th century battlefield, with weapons and combative techniques that are unique to Kerala. The word &quot;Kalaripayattu&quot; is a combination of two Malayalam words - &quot;kalari&quot; (training ground or battleground) and &quot;payattu&quot; (training of martial arts), which is roughly translated as &quot;practice in the arts of the battlefield&quot;. The name &#x27;Kalari&#x27; may also be derived from the Malayalam or Sanskrit term &#x27;Khaloorika,&#x27; which is the name of a goddess associated with Shaktism who is worshipped in Kalaripayattu. The &quot;Kamika Agama&quot;, a 5th century CE South Indian ancient text on Shaiva Siddhanta, discusses the construction of the &#x27;Khaloorika&#x27;, as place for military exercise.

== History ==

===Associations with Indian folklore and legends===
According to legend, Parashurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu, learned the art from Shiva, and taught it to the original settlers of Kerala shortly after bringing Kerala up from the ocean floor. A song in Malayalam refers to Parashurama&#x27;s creation of Kerala, and credits him with the establishment of the first 108 kalaris throughout Kerala, along with the instruction of the first 21 Kalaripayattu gurus in Kerala on the destruction of enemies.

According to another legend, Ayyappa, a war deity from Kerala, learned Kalaripayattu in the Cheerappanchira Kalari in Muhamma.

=== Early history ===
According to Philip Zarrilli, the Dravidian combat techniques of the Sangam period (600 BCE–300 CE) and Sanskritic Dhanur Vedic traditions were the earliest precursors to Kalaripayattu. Each warrior in the Sangam era received regular military training in target practice, horse and elephant riding. They specialized in one or more of the important weapons of the period including the spear (&quot;vel&quot;), sword (&quot;val&quot;), shield (&quot;kedaham&quot;), and bow and arrow (&quot;vil ambu&quot;).

=== Late medieval period (c.1100 CE–c.1500 CE)===
According to Zarrilli, Kalaripayattu has been practiced &quot;since at least the twelfth century&quot; CE. During the 11th century, the second Chera kingdom fought a century-long war with the Chola kingdom, which ended with disintegration of the Chera kingdom. During this period, military combat training was compulsory, and according to Elamkulam Kunjan Pillai, Kalaripayattu took shape in this period. According to historian A. Sreedharan Menon, Kalaripayattu was among the most important aspects of feudal Keralite society, as it helped impart military training and Spartan-like discipline amongst the youth of Kerala, irrespective of caste, community or sex.

Each village in late medieval Kerala had its own &quot;kalari&quot;, which contained a presiding deity known as &quot;Bhagavathy&quot; or &quot;Paradevata&quot;. Children in Kerala who finished their education in local schools would join their local &quot;kalari&quot; to receive further military training. This was especially common amongst martial sects of various communities in Kerala, such as the Nairs and Thiyyars. The local legendary poems of Kerala, popularly known as &quot;Vadakkan Pattu&quot;, have been passed down through oral tradition and describe the deeds of warriors, indicating the practice of Kalarippayattu. These ballads, dating back as early as the 12th century, depict a social system in which every youth was required to undergo martial training.

In the late medieval period Kalaripayattu extended into the Kerala practice of &quot;ankam&quot; (&quot;combat&quot; or &quot;battle&quot; in Malayalam) as a way to settle disputes that could not be settled by local governmental assemblies. A variant of &quot;ankam&quot;, called &quot;poithu&quot; was also practiced, and was a duel between two individuals. Combatants participating in &quot;ankam&quot; or &quot;poithu&quot; used Kalaripayattu, and the combatants were given up to 12 years to prepare and train prior to the &quot;ankam&quot; itself, so that all combatants could achieve the highest level of proficiency with Kalaripayattu traditional weaponry. In some cases, professional mercenaries trained in Kalaripayattu were paid to engage in &quot;ankam&quot; on the behalf of others.

===Early modern and colonial period (c.1500–c.1900 CE)===

====Descriptions by Europeans====
In 1498, a Portuguese fleet under Vasco da Gama discovered a new sea route from Europe to India, which paved the way for direct Indo-European commerce. The next to arrive were the Dutch, with their main base in Ceylon. They established ports in Malabar. Following the Dutch, the British—who set up in the west coast port of Surat in 1619—and the French both established trading outposts in India.

Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese explorer who visited Kerala in the 16th century, noted that the physical exercise complexes of the Nairs and Thiyyars created a network of martial culture in Malabar, and wrote about Nair military training in Kalaripayattu:
Hendrik van Rheede, governor of Dutch Malabar between 1669 and 1676, wrote about Chekavar (Malabar Thiyyar) training in Kalaripayattu in &quot;Hortus Malabaricus&quot;: 

Jacob Canter Visscher (1692–1735), in his &quot;Letters from Malabar&quot;, wrote about the Chekavars: 

====Decline of Kalaripayattu====
The widespread practice and prevalence of Kalaripayattu in Kerala began to decline in the 17th century, when the usage of guns and cannons became widespread. This also coincided with the European invasions into Kerala, after which, firearms began to surpass the usage of traditional weaponry such as swords and spears.

The late medieval &quot;golden age&quot; of Kalaripayattu is preserved in the &quot;Vadakkan Pattukkal&quot; (17th–18th century), a collection of ballads about warrior heroes and heroines from earlier periods in Kerala, such as Aromal Chekavar (16th century), Unniyarcha (16th century), and Thacholi Othenan, who were celebrated for their martial prowess, chivalry and idealism. The heroes and heroines belong mainly to two matrilinear families, one of Tiyya origin and another Nair. In the Vadakkan Pattukal, it is stated that the cardinal principle of Kalaripayattu was that knowledge of the art be used to further worthy causes, and not for the advancement of one&#x27;s own selfish interests.
In 1804, the British banned Kalaripayattu in Kerala in response to the Kottayathu War, a rebellion against British rule in Kerala led by the Keralite king Pazhassi Raja. The ban came into effect shortly after Pazhassi Raja&#x27;s death on November 30, 1805, resulting in the closure of most of the major &quot;kalari&quot; training grounds in Kerala. Following the ban, many Keralite &quot;gurukkals&quot; of Kalaripayattu resisted the ban and continued to teach Kalaripayattu to their students in secret. &quot;Gurukkals&quot; such as Kottackkal Kanaran Gurukkal, Kelu Kurup Gurukkal and Maroli Ramunni Gurukkal, learned and preserved the martial art for posterity and were responsible for preserving Kalaripayattu into the beginning of the twentieth century, as well as sparking the revival of Kalaripayattu in Kerala in the 1920s.

=== Resurgence in modern times (20th–21st century)===
The resurgence of public interest in Kalaripayattu began in the 1920s in Thalassery, as part of a wave of rediscovery of the traditional arts throughout southern India and continued through the 1970s surge of general worldwide interest in martial arts.

During this period of renewed public interest in Kerala&#x27;s native martial art, Kalaripayattu &quot;gurukkals&quot; such as Kottakkal Kanaran Gurukkal, Chambadan Veetil Narayanan Nair. Chambadan Veetil Narayanan Nair, a student of Kottackkal Kanaran Gurukkal, and in whose memory the CVN Kalaris are named, opened several &quot;kalaris&quot;, and began to spread Kalaripayattu across its native state of Kerala, revitalizing the art across the state in the twentieth century.

Chirakkal T. Sreedharan Nair is also widely credited for reviving and preserving Kalaripayattu by writing the first books ever written on Kalaripayattu, as well as writing the first authoritative text on the martial art. Sreedharan Nair is credited with writing &quot;Kalaripayattu&quot;, the first book ever written on Kalaripayattu, in 1937. This book was written in Malayalam, and listed the &quot;vaithari&quot; or oral commands, of all the exercises relating to &quot;meypayattu&quot;, or conditioning techniques. He is also credited with writing the first authoritative text and primer on Kalaripayattu, called &quot;Kalarippayattu – A Complete Guide to Kerala’s Ancient Martial Art.&quot; The text, alongside a compilation of Sreedharan Nair&#x27;s teaching notes, were translated into English by his sons S. R. A. Das and S. R. D. Prasad and then published by Westland Books. The book contains over 1,700 action photographs as well as explanations behind all of the exercises. It continues to be the most authentic reference material on Kalaripayattu to this day.

In the modern era, Kalaripayattu is also used by practitioners of Keralite dance styles, such as Kathakali and Mohiniyattam, as part of their training regimens. Recently, dancers from other, non-Keralite dance forms have also begun to incorporate Kalaripayattu into their training regimes, such as Vasundhara Doraswamy, a notable Bharatanatyam dancer.

In 2017, a 73-year-old &quot;gurukkal&quot; from Vadakara, Sri Meenakshi Amma, was awarded the Padma Sri by the Government of India for her contributions to the preservation of Kalaripayattu.

In January 2021, the Government of Kerala announced the opening of The Kalaripayattu Academy in Kerala&#x27;s capital, Thiruvananthapuram, under the management of the Kerala Department of Tourism. The Kalaripayattu Academy will comprise an area of 3,500 feet, and will be part of the Vellar Crafts Village. The Kalaripayattu classes will be taught by a group of &quot;gurukkals&quot; from Kerala, led by Sri Meenakshi Amma, a Kalaripayattu &quot;gurukkal&quot; and Padma Sri recipient. The Kalaripayattu Academy will initially teach 100 students, both adults and children, in both morning and evening classes. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is set to announce the syllabus of the academy in 2021.

== Practice ==


===Guru–shishya tradition===
Kalaripayattu is taught in accordance with the Indian &quot;guru-shishya&quot; system. Development and mastery of Kalaripayattu comes from the tradition of constantly learning, adapting and improving the techniques by observing what techniques are practical and effective. While importance is placed on observation of tradition, Kalaripayattu &quot;gurukkuls&quot; have contributed to the evolution of Kalaripayattu by way of their experience and reasoning.

===Weaponry and armor===
Kalaripayattu includes strikes, kicks, grappling, preset forms, weaponry, and healing methods. Warriors trained in Kalaripayattu would use very light, and basic body armor, as it was difficult to maintain flexibility and mobility while in heavy armor. Kalaripayattu differs from many other martial arts systems in the world in that weapon-based techniques are taught first, and barehanded techniques are taught last. The weapons used include gadas, spears, daggers, and urumis. 

===Training ground===

Kalaripayattu is taught in a specialized training ground known as a &quot;kalari&quot;. The location and construction of each &quot;kalari&quot; is built in accordance to Hindu architectural treatises such as the &quot;Vastu Shastras&quot; along with various religious traditions and customs native to Kerala. Specifications are made regarding the physical dimensions of the &quot;kalari&quot;, how deep the ground in a &quot;kalari&quot; must be, along with the material that the floor of the &quot;kalari&quot; must consist of. 

The floor of each &quot;kalari&quot; consists of red sand which is mixed with specific herbs that are said to aid in the treatment of small wounds suffered during training. The directional aspects of &quot;kalari&quot; construction are also specified, such as the entrance of the &quot;kalari&quot; facing east, and the location of ritualistic structures such as the &quot;Poothara&quot;, &quot;Ganapatithara&quot;, and &quot;Guruthara&quot;, are to face the west. The &quot;Poothara&quot; (&quot;Flower ground&quot; or &quot;Flower floor&quot; in Malayalam) in a kalari is a seven-step raised platform with a lotus-shaped &quot;kumbha&quot; or figure, at its apex. The art uses concepts similar to the ancient Indian medical text, the Ayurveda, and the seven steps represent the seven &quot;dhatu&quot; and the &quot;kosha&quot; of the human body as per Ayurvedic traditions. The &quot;kumbha&quot; at the apex of the poothara is said to represent Bhagavathy or the heart of the individual. The Ganapatithara (&quot;Ground of Ganapati&quot; in Malayalam) is the area of the kalari that is reserved for the worship of Ganapati, a Hindu deity that is said to be the remover of obstacles. The Guruthara (&quot;Ground of the Guru&quot; in Malayalam) is the area of the kalari that is reserved for worship of the Guru of the &quot;kalari,&quot; who represents the tradition of gurukkals in Kerala who protected and taught Kalaripayattu to the next generation. In the Ganapatithara, Ganapati is symbolically invoked by the placing of an &quot;otta&quot;, or tusk-shaped wooden stick. The &quot;paduka&quot;, or footwear, is placed at the Guruthara to symbolize the life of a gurukkal. The presiding deity of Kalaripayattu is said to be Bhadrakali or Bhagavathy. 

Before every training session in the kalari, salutations are provided to the presiding deities and obedience is paid to the kalari temple. Students apply tilak or tikka on their foreheads and upon the forehead of the idol of the presiding deity using soil from the ground of the kalari.

===Training uniform===
The traditional training uniform used in Kalaripayattu is the &quot;kachakettal&quot;, a loincloth that is either red and white or red and black in colour. Along with traditional attire, oral commands, or &quot;vaithari&quot;, are given by the guru during training sessions, and are given in Sanskrit or Malayalam.

=== &quot;Chuvadu&quot; and &quot;Vadivu&quot;===
A number of South Asian fighting styles remain closely connected to yoga, dance and performing arts. Some of the choreographed sparring in Kalaripayattu can be applied to dance and Kathakali dancers who knew Kalaripayattu were believed to be markedly better than other performers. Some traditional Indian classical dance schools still incorporate martial arts as part of their exercise regimen.

Kalaripayattu techniques are a combination of steps (&quot;Chuvadu&quot;) and postures (&quot;Vadivu&quot;). &quot;Chuvadu&quot; literally means &#x27;steps&#x27;, the basic steps of the martial arts. &quot;Vadivu&quot; literally means &#x27;postures&#x27; or stances which are the foundations of Kalaripayattu training. They are named after animals, and are usually presented in eight forms. Styles differ considerably from one tradition to another. Not only do the names of poses differ, but their utilization and interpretation vary depending on the &quot;gurukkal&quot;, and the traditions of the &quot;kalari&quot;. Each stance has its own style, combination, and function. These techniques vary from one style to another.

===Adaption of new techniques===
A Kalari practitioner might encounter new fighting techniques from an enemy combatant. The Kalari practitioner would need to learn how to anticipate, adapt to and neutralize these new techniques. This is especially seen in the Southern style of Kalaripayattu, which is believed to have been adapted and modified during wars with Tamil kingdoms to counter martial arts like Silambam, which was one of the main martial art forms practiced by Tamil soldiers at the time.

===Massage===

As a result of learning about the human body, Indian martial artists became knowledgeable in the fields of traditional medicine and massage. Kalaripayattu teachers often provide massages (&quot;uzhichil&quot;) with medicinal oils to their students in order to increase their physical flexibility or to treat muscular injuries. Such massages are generally termed &quot;thirumal&quot; and the unique massage given to increase flexibility is known as &quot;katcha thirumal&quot;.

== Styles ==
Each style, or &quot;vazhi&quot;, in Kalaripayattu has a different purpose. The styles are variations that various masters have adapted and modified according to their understanding of the art. 

There are two major styles that are generally acknowledged within traditional Kalaripayattu, and are based on the regions in which they are practiced, the Northern style, or &quot;Vadakkan Kalari&quot;, and the Southern style, or &quot;Thekkan Kalari.&quot; These two systems have marked similarities in their styles or &quot;vazhi&quot; (&quot;way&quot; or &quot;method&quot; in Malayalam), such as &quot;Hanuman Vazhi&quot;, &quot;Bhiman Vazhi&quot;, and &quot;Bali Vazhi&quot; among others. The northern style of Kalaripayattu, or &quot;Vadakkan Kalari,&quot; is primarily practiced in the Malabar region of Kerala, and is based on elegant and flexible movements, evasions, jumps and weapons training. The southern style of Kalaripayattu, or &quot;Thekkan Kalari,&quot; is primarily practiced in the southern regions of Kerala, and specializes in hard, impact based techniques with emphasis on hand-to-hand combat and pressure point strikes. Both systems make use of internal and external concepts.

A third style, the Central style, or &quot;Madhya Kalari&quot;, is also practiced, but it is less commonly practiced than its northern and southern counterparts. A smaller, regional style of Kalaripayattu called &quot;Tulunadan Kalari&quot;, is referenced in texts such as the Vadakkan Pattukal, but it is largely restricted to the Tulu Nadu region in northern Kerala and southern Karnataka. Other smaller, regional styles are also said to exist in isolated regions of Kerala, but these styles are becoming increasingly rare, and difficult to find. Examples include &quot;Dronamballi&quot;, &quot;Odimurassery&quot;, &quot;Tulu Nadan Shaiva Mura&quot;, and &quot;Kayyangali&quot;.

=== Northern style ===
The Northern style is also known as, &quot;Vadakkan Kalari&quot;, and is generally regarded as the &quot;original,&quot; form of Kalaripayattu. This system places more emphasis on physical flexibility exercises rooted on the slogan &quot;Meyy kanavanam&quot;, meaning, &quot;make the body an eye.&quot; These exercises are done individually, as well as in combinations. After that &quot;meypayattu&quot; (a concept similar to kata in Karate) is taught. These are a combination of flexibility exercises with offensive and defensive techniques, however, the actual techniques are taught very much later. Traditionally, the number of &quot;meypayattu&quot; may differ as per the teaching methods of the guru. Training is usually done in four stages, the first stage being &quot;Meipayattu&quot; (training stances), followed by &quot;Kolthari&quot; (practice with wooden weapons), &quot;Angathari&quot; (practice with metal weapons) and finally &quot;Verum kai&quot; (barehanded combat). Generally, the majority of the &quot;Kalaris&quot; (schools that teach Kalaripayattu) start training with weapons within 3 to 6 months. Some Kalaris only allow one weapon to be learned per year. After long stick and small stick fighting, iron weapons are introduced. Weapons training begins with the dagger and sword, followed by the spear. Not all modern schools use specialized weapons. Traditionally, bows and arrows were commonly used in Kerala and students were trained in these techniques, but is rarely taught today.

=== Southern style ===
The Southern style is also known as &quot;Thekkan Kalari&quot;. Traditionally, it is believed to be a style of Kalaripayattu that is said to have been altered and influenced by Agastya. It is an essentially the northern style of Kalaripayattu that has been influenced by martial arts from neighboring regions, such as Varma Adi or Adi Murai. While the Southern form of Kalaripayattu has notable similarities to Varma Adi, it is considered to be a distinct and separate martial art from Varma Adi due to its similarities to Northern Kalaripayattu. The similarities between the southern form of Kalaripayattu and Varma Adi are likely due to geographic proximity to each other, with the Southern style of Kalaripayattu being considered a mixture of Kalaripayattu and Varma Adi. While the Southern style is less commonly practiced in Kerala compared to the Northern style, it is revered in Kerala as a combination of the teachings of both Parashurama and Agastya. It is predominantly practiced in some regions of the southern parts of Kerala, particularly in areas near Kanyakumari. While many of the exercises of the Southern style are identical to the Northern Style, it is more combative and martial in nature, and places heavy emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, hard impact techniques, and footwork, rather than emphasizing flexibility like the Northern style. It starts with the training in &quot;Chuvadu,&quot; a system of various combinations of fighting techniques similar to Muay Thai and Judo. Immediately after that, sparring with a partner is introduced as part of the training. These pre-determined techniques are repeatedly trained. After a basic proficiency in unarmed combat is established, weapons training begins with a small stick. Small stick training is usually done with two combatants, armed with a stick or dagger. These are primarily defensive techniques. Fighting techniques with two combatants having the same weapons include sparring with long stick, sword, etc. During the duration of this training, the refining of un-armed combat also progresses. As the student gains more experience, a small amount of knowledge pertaining to the &quot;Marma&quot; points (pressure points) is also taught to the student if deemed appropriate by the &quot;gurukkal&quot;.

== &quot;Marmashastram&quot; - striking of vital points ==
It is claimed that experienced Kalari warriors could disable or kill their opponents by merely striking the correct &quot;marmam&quot; (vital point) on their opponent&#x27;s body. This technique is taught only to the most promising and level-headed students so as to discourage misuse of the technique. &quot;Marmashastram&quot; stresses on the knowledge of marmam and is also used for marma treatment (&quot;marmachikitsa&quot;). This system of marma treatment originated from Ayurveda, as well as Siddha medicine. Critics of Kalaripayattu have pointed out that the application of marmam techniques against neutral outsiders has not always produced verifiable results.
The earliest mention of marmam is found in the &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, where Indra is said to have defeated Vritra by attacking his &quot;marmam&quot; with a vajra. References to marmam are also found in the &quot;Atharva Veda&quot;. With numerous other scattered references to vital points in Vedic and epic sources, it is certain that India&#x27;s early martial artists knew about and practiced attacking or defending vital points. Sushruta (c. 6th century BCE) identified and defined 107 vital points of the human body in his &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot;. Of these 107 points, 64 were classified as being lethal if properly struck with a fist or stick. Sushruta&#x27;s work formed the basis of the medical discipline Ayurveda, which was taught alongside various Indian martial arts that had an emphasis on vital points, such as Varma kalai and Marma adi.

==Governing bodies==
In India, the Indian Kalaripayattu Federation (IKF) in Thiruvananthapuram is one of the primary governing bodies of Kalaripayattu. It is recognized by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports of the Government of India. It received affiliation as a regional sports federation in 2015.

The Kalaripayattu Federation of India (KFI), based in Kozhikode, is another governing body of Kalaripayattu, as has been recognized by the Indian Olympic Association.

The Kerala Kalaripayattu Association (KKA) in Thiruvananthapuram is also a governing body of the martial art which is recognised by the Kerala State Sports Council.

==Notable practitioners==
Kottakkal Kanaran Gurukkal (1850-1935), also known as the “Dronacharya of Kalaripayattu,” was a &quot;gurukkal&quot; of Chambadan Veetil Narayanan Nair. Korrakkal Kanaran Gurukkal is recognized as one of the &quot;gurukkals&quot; who preserved Kalaripayattu in Kerala and allowed it to survive into the twentieth century after studying it from several gurukkals in the Malabar region of the state. During the British ban of Kalaripayattu, he is said to have sold his lands and property to finance the study of Kalaripayattu.

Chambadan Veetil Narayanan Nair (1905-1944), a Kalaripayattu &quot;gurukkal&quot; and student of Kottakal Kanaran Gurukkal, who was popularly known as &quot;CVN&quot; and in whose memory the CVN Kalaris sprang up across Kerala, enabling the revival of Kalaripayattu across its native state.

Chirakkal T. Sreedharan Nair (1909-1984), a Kalaripayattu &quot;gurukkal&quot;, and founder of Sree Bharat Kalari (formerly known as Rajkumar Kalari). He is known for writing the first books on Kalaripayattu. His first work, &quot;Kalaripayattu&quot;, written in Malayalam and published in 1937, was the first book written on Kalaripayattu. He also authored first authoritative text and primer on Kalaripayattu, called &quot;Kalarippayattu – A Complete Guide to Kerala’s Ancient Martial Art.&quot; The text is considered to be the most authentic reference material on Kalaripayattu to this day.

For their contributions to the preservation of Kalaripayattu, Meenakshi Amma, a 73 year old &quot;gurukkal&quot; from Vadakara and Sankara Narayana Menon Chundayil, a &quot;gurukkal&quot; from Chavakkad, were awarded the Padma Sri by the Government of India.

==In popular culture==

In the Indian graphic novels &quot;Odayan&quot; and &quot;Odayan II – Yuddham&quot;, the title character is a vigilante who is highly skilled in Kalaripayattu, with the story itself being set in 16th century feudal Kerala.

&quot;Little Kalari Warriors&quot;, a cartoon made by Toonz Animation India for Cartoon Network, features Kalaripayattu practitioners as the principal characters. Kalaripayattu is also seen in the Indian animated film &quot;&quot; (2012). In the Indian role-playing game &quot;Ashwathama — The Immortal&quot;, which is based on Indian mythology, the fight scenes were choreographed using Kalaripayattu, with the movements of the characters being motion captured from real Kalaripayattu masters.

Kalaripayattu is used as a fighting style for the character Connie Maheswaran in the American animated television series &quot;Steven Universe&quot;. Outside of Indian video games, characters in international games also use Kalaripayattu, such as Voldo in the &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; series, Asura in &quot;Death Battle&quot;, and Zafina in the &quot;Tekken&quot; series among others. The style is also used by Cyril Rahman, Ethan Stanley and Shō Kanō in the Japanese manga TV series &quot;&quot;. In 2019, a character of Indian origin was introduced for the first time in the Japanese manga, &quot;Agari&quot;. It features a character named Ravi, a Kalaripayattu master, as the protagonist.

While numerous documentaries have been made about or referencing Kalaripayattu, one of the earliest known documentaries on the subject is a BBC documentary titled &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;. Kalaripayattu was also documented in Season 2 of Fight Quest.

=== In film ===
Kalaripayattu has also featured in international and Indian films such as:

*&quot;Thacholi Othenan&quot; (1964)
*&quot;Aromalunni&quot; (1972)
*&quot;Ondanondu Kaladalli&quot; (Kannada) (1978)

<text>Privy Councillor () was the civil position (class) in the Russian Empire, according to the Table of Ranks introduced by Peter the Great in 1722. Initially, it was a civil rank of the 4th class, but from 1724 it was upgraded to the 3rd class. The rank was equal to those of Lieutenant-General in the Army and Vice-Admiral in the Navy. The rank holder should be addressed as &quot;Your Excellency&quot; (, Vashe Prevoskhoditelstvo).

==Overview==
The name of the rank can be associated with the original meaning of the words &quot;secret&quot; and &quot;trustworthy&quot;. Those awarded this rank occupied the highest public offices, such as Minister or Deputy Minister, the head of a large department, senator, and academic of the Imperial Academy of Sciences. Occasionally, the rank was awarded to the long-time province governors to recognize their merits before their transfer to the capital. In addition to St. Petersburg, Privy Councillors could serve in Moscow and other large cities of the Russian Empire, for example in Tbilisi. The rector of Moscow State University, well-known historians Sergey Solovyov and Vasily Klyuchevsky, Professor of the Moscow Theological Academy Nicolay Subbotin were Privy Councillors. In 1903, there were 553 Privy Councillors in Russia.

The rank was abolished in 1917 by the Soviet decree on estates and civil ranks.

<doc id="288700" wikidata="Q276107" url="?curid=288700" title="Daruma doll">
<text>A is a hollow, round, Japanese traditional doll modeled after Bodhidharma, the founder of the Zen tradition of Buddhism. These dolls, though typically red and depicting the Indian monk, Bodhidharma, vary greatly in color and design depending on region and artist. Though considered a toy by some, Daruma has a design that is rich in symbolism and is regarded more as a talisman of good luck to the Japanese. Daruma dolls are seen as a symbol of perseverance and good luck, making them a popular gift of encouragement. The doll has also been commercialized by many Buddhist temples to use alongside the setting of goals.

==Use== 

When purchased, the figure&#x27;s eyes are both blank white. The owner selects a goal or wish and paints in the left eye of the figure&#x27;s two eyes with Chinese or Japanese ink. Once the goal is achieved, the right eye is filled in.

==Bodhidharma==
Bodhidharma was a Buddhist monk who lived during the 5th/6th century CE. He is traditionally credited as the transmitter of Ch&#x27;an (Zen) to China. Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is available, and subsequent accounts have become layered with legend. According to one tradition, Bodhidharma gained a reputation for, among other things, his practice of wall-gazing. Legend claims that he sat facing a wall in meditation for a period of nine years without moving, which caused his legs and arms to fall off from atrophy. Another popular legend is that after falling asleep during his nine-year meditation he became angry with himself and cut off his eyelids to avoid ever falling asleep again.

According to the principal Chinese sources, Bodhidharma came from the Western Regions, which refers to Central Asia but may also include the Indian subcontinent, and was either a &quot;Persian Central Asian&quot; or a &quot;South Indian ... the third son of a great Indian king.&quot; Throughout Buddhist art, Bodhidharma is depicted as an ill-tempered, bearded, wide-eyed non-Chinese person. He is referred as &quot;The Blue-Eyed Barbarian&quot; () in Chan texts, although note that while the translation &quot;barbarian&quot; is derogatory, in Chinese it is simply descriptive of non-Chinese origin.

==History and commercialization==

The current popular symbolism associated with Daruma as a good luck charm in part originated at Shorinzan Daruma Temple, in the city of Takasaki (Gunma Prefecture, north of Tokyo). Josef Kyburz, author of &quot;&quot;Omocha&quot;: Things to Play (Or Not to Play) with&quot;, explained that the founder of Daruma-Dera would draw New Year’s charms depicting Bodhidharma. The parishioners would keep these charms to &quot;bring happiness and prosperity and ward off accidents and misfortune&quot;.
It is believed that the Daruma figurine then originated from this region when the ninth priest, Togaku, found a solution to handle the constant requests of the parishioners for new charms. The charms were always given with an effectiveness of one year, so the people required new ones every year. He solved this by entrusting them with the making of their own Daruma charms near the beginning of the Meiwa period (1764–72). The temple made wooden block molds for the people to use. The peasants then used these molds to make three-dimensional papier-mâché charms.

Kyburz notes that though it is unknown when the Daruma figurine combined with the tumbler doll; the two were well recognized as synonymous by the mid-19th century. The doll quickly grew in popularity, becoming a mascot of the region. This was due greatly in part to fact that the majority of the families were silk farmers, a crop which requires a great deal of luck for success.

There is an annual held by the city of Takasaki in celebration of being the proclaimed birthplace of the Daruma doll. The celebration is held at the Shorinzan, the name of Takasaki&#x27;s &quot;Daruma-Dera&quot;. According to the Takasaki city website, &quot;Over 400,000 people from all over the Kanto Plain come to buy new good-luck dolls for the year. Takasaki produces 80% of Japan&#x27;s Daruma dolls.&quot; The festival also features a 24-hour reading of sutras by the Shorinzan monks for world peace.

==Physical features and symbolism==

Daruma’s design, particularly the shape, color, eyes and facial hair, each have its own history and symbolic meaning.

===Shape===
Darumas are still usually made of papier-mâché, have a round shape, are hollow and weighted at the bottom so that they will always return to an upright position when tilted over. In Japanese, a roly-poly toy is called &quot;okiagari&quot;, meaning to get up (&quot;oki&quot;) and arise (&quot;agari&quot;). This characteristic has come to symbolize the ability to have success, overcome adversity, and recover from misfortune. In Japanese popular culture on cards, banners and books, Daruma is often illustrated alongside the phrase &quot;Nanakorobi Yaoki&quot; (), translated to mean &quot;seven times down, eight times up&quot;. While some traditional Daruma dolls have flat bases, the Sankaku or Triangle Daruma () is constructed from a rolled cardboard cone attached to a rounded clay base so that it always stands straight when tilted.

The tumbler doll style is similar to an earlier toy called the Okiagari Koboshi, a little self-righting monk which was popular in the Kinki region during the mid-17th century. The original okiagari toy, however, is said to have been introduced from Ming China around 1368–1644.

===Color===

Though it is not certain, the origins of Daruma&#x27;s traditional red coloring probably came from the color of priest&#x27;s robes. Reliable sources in English are hard to find, but one Japan-based website cites this red as being the &quot;color of the robe of a high-ranking priest. The author then concludes that &quot;since Daruma was the founder of the Zen Sect, he must have worn a red robe.&quot; The art historian James T. Ulak has documented a history of depictions of the Bodhidharma wearing lavish red robes, prior to representations of him as a doll, in an article entitled &quot;Japanese Works in The Art Institute of Chicago.&quot;

By virtue of his red robes, Daruma has come to play a role in recovering from sickness. During the late Edo period (1603-1868), red was believed to have a strong association to smallpox. Hartmut O. Rotermond, author of &quot;Demonic Affliction or Contagious Disease?&quot;, describes that in Edo and surrounding cities, there were many outbreaks of measles and smallpox. In present-day Japan, there are many red shrines dedicated to a God of Smallpox, which had a particular liking for red. These shrines were built in response to those outbreaks. Believing that the God of smallpox, if pleased, would spare the afflicted child, the Japanese would often stretch out ropes around the house strung with red paper strips, have the child wear a red robe, and make a small altar for the God to put talisman-like Daruma figurines on. These precautions were also used to warn others that sickness was in the house, and to encourage cleanliness around the sick. The red of Daruma, however, was used to pacify the God, while the image of okiagari was to encourage the patient to recover as quickly as they fell ill. Daruma are also sold as a set of five colors – blue, yellow, red, white and black – called &quot;Goshiki Daruma&quot;. These days, daruma can also be found in colors other than red, including gold, which is meant to bring luck in financial matters.

===Eyes===

The eyes of Daruma are often blank when sold. Monte A. Greer, author of &quot;Daruma Eyes&quot;, described the &quot;oversized symmetrical round blank white eyes&quot; as a means to keep track of goals or big tasks and motivate them to work to the finish. The recipient of the doll fills in one eye upon setting the goal, then the other upon fulfilling it. In this way, every time they see the one-eyed Daruma, they recall the goal. One explanation how this custom started says that in order to motivate Daruma-san to grant your wish, you promise to give him full sight once the goal is accomplished. This practice might also have something to do with the &quot;enlightenment&quot;, the ideal attainment of Buddhism. This custom has led to a phrase in Japanese translated as &quot;Both Eyes Open&quot;. Referring to &quot;opening&quot; the second eye, it expresses the realization of a goal. Traditionally, the Daruma was purchased as a household item, and only the head of the household would paint in the eyes.

One example of this is politicians during election time. Political parties have often been shown at their headquarters with large Daruma dolls and amulets purchased from local temples as a prayer for victory. This practice was highlighted in a 1967 article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine: &quot;Last week, in the Tokyo headquarters of Japan&#x27;s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Premier Eisaku Satō dipped a sumi brush into an ink stone and with swift strokes daubed in the dark right eye of his Daruma. &#x27;The eyes,&#x27; he remarked when he had finished, &#x27;are as big as my own.&#x27;&quot;

The Matsukawa Daruma () is produced with the eyes already painted, with the purpose of watching over a family&#x27;s household. These intricate figures are more slender than traditional Daruma and typically feature blue coloring and a base molded (or simply painted) in the form of the ship that transports the Seven Lucky Gods.

===Facial hair===
Daruma&#x27;s facial hair is a symbolic representation of the animals well known in Asian culture to embody longevity: the crane and the tortoise. The eyebrows are in the shape of a crane, while the cheek hair resembles the shell of the tortoise. A Japanese-based website states that originally, there was a snake or dragon depicted across the moustache and cheeks, but was changed to tortoise to emphasize the desire for longevity. In this way, Daruma was designed to match the Japanese proverb &quot;The crane lives 1000 years, the tortoise 10,000 years&quot;.

==Daruma burning==

At the end of the year, all the Daruma are brought back to the temple they were purchased from for a traditional burning ceremony. This ceremony, called the , is held once a year, usually right after New Year&#x27;s Day. The most renowned of these events are held at the Nishi-Arai Daishi Temple (Tokyo), and the Dairyū-ji Temple (Gifu). At these events, people bring the Daruma figures they had used that year to the temple. After expressing gratitude to them, they turn them over to the temple and buy new ones for the next year. All of the old Daruma figures are burnt together in the temple. After a solemn display of the monks&#x27; entry, reading of the sutras and blowing of horns, the tens of thousands of figurines are then set aflame.

==Feminine representations==
Daruma dolls also come in the form of and . This contrasts greatly with traditional representations of Bodhidharma, who, accredited as the father of many martial arts, has traditionally been depicted as very masculine with rough facial hair. H. Neill McFarland, Professor of Theology, discusses the feminine representations of Bodhidharma in his article &quot;Feminine Motifs in Bodhidharma Symbology in Japan&quot;. The answer to this anomaly lies in the social changes at the time, developing in the Edo Period. The class distinctions placed the merchants at the bottom, who in turn developed their own culture focusing on humor and poking fun at what those of higher class held sacred. This is evident in the depiction of Bodhidharma as a prostitute since prostitutes displayed the same &quot;okiagari&quot; resilience. Famous pieces of art depicting Bodhidharma were also redrawn with a woman in his place.

With the inception of the Daruma doll, the Onna Daruma doll quickly followed. Though the aforementioned examples of feminine motifs of Bodhidharma were satirical, the doll forms maintain the same wholesome image of a bringer of good luck.

==Children&#x27;s games==

Many children&#x27;s games make mention of Daruma. In Japanese, snowmen are called &quot;Yukidaruma&quot; (), literally &quot;snow daruma&quot;. Possibly because the shape is related to Daruma, they usually only have two sections instead of three. Darumasan ga Koronda is an equivalent to the American Red Light/Green Light game. is a traditional game played with a daruma doll in five pieces, usually in the colors of the rainbow, from top to bottom: head – a man&#x27;s face, blue, green, yellow, red. The game is played by using a small hammer to hit each of the colored pieces, from bottom to the top, without letting the pieces fall during the game.

<text>Vaud ( ; , ), more formally the Canton of Vaud, is one of the 26 cantons forming the Swiss Confederation. It is composed of ten districts; its capital city is Lausanne. Its coat of arms bears the motto &quot;Liberté et patrie&quot; on a white-green bicolour.

Vaud is the third-largest Swiss canton by population and fourth by size. It is located in Romandy, the French-speaking western part of the country, and borders the canton of Neuchâtel to the north, the cantons of Fribourg and Bern to the east, the canton of Valais to the south, the canton of Geneva to the south-west, and France to the west. The geography of the canton includes all three natural regions of Switzerland: the Jura Mountains, the Swiss Plateau, and the (Swiss) Alps. It also includes some of the largest lakes of the country: Lake Geneva and Lake Neuchâtel. It is a major tourist destination, renowned for its landscapes and gastronomy.

The largest city is Lausanne, followed by Yverdon-les-Bains and Montreux. As of , the canton had a population of . It is one of the four cantons where French is the sole official language, and it is the canton with the largest number of French speakers. Formerly a Bernese bailiwick, Vaud joined the Swiss Confederation as an independent canton in 1803.

==History==

Humans lived alongside the Vaud lakes in prehistoric times. Later, the Celtic tribe of the Helvetii inhabited the area. Caesar&#x27;s troops defeated the Helvetii in 58 BC and as a consequence the Romans settled in the area. The many towns established by the Romans include Vevey () and Lausanne (&quot;Lausonium&quot; or &quot;Lausonna&quot;).

While the exact date of the founding of Aventicum is not exact, it was likely established during or shortly after Augustus&#x27; reign. There are still many Roman remains around the town today. Between the 2nd and the 4th centuries Alemannic tribes repeatedly invaded the area, and in the 5th century the Burgundians occupied the territory. The Merovingian Franks later replaced the Burgundians. Their control did not last long either, and in 888 the area of the canton of Vaud became part of the Carolingian Empire (the successor state to the Merovingians). In 1032 the Zähringens of Germany defeated the Burgundians. The Zähringens themselves were succeeded in 1218 by the counts of Savoy. It was only under the counts of Savoy that the area gained political unity as the Barony of Vaud. A part stretching from Attalens to the river Sarine, in the north, was absorbed by the canton of Fribourg.
As the power of the House of Savoy declined at the beginning of the 15th century, troops from Bern occupied the land. By 1536 Bern had completely annexed the area. Vaud&#x27;s Protestant Reformation started with co-workers of John Calvin like Pierre Viret (a famous debate took place at the cathedral of Lausanne), but it was only decisively implemented when Bern put its full force behind it.

The Bernese occupiers were not popular amongst the population. In 1723 Major Abraham Davel led a revolt against Bern, in protest at what he saw as the denial of political rights of the French-speaking Vaudois by the German-speaking Bernese; he was subsequently beheaded. Later, inspired by the French Revolution of 1789–1799, the Vaudois drove out the Bernese governor in 1798 and declared the Lemanic Republic. Vaud nationalists like Frédéric-César de La Harpe, born in Rolle, had called for French intervention in liberating the area, and French Revolutionary troops moved in, taking over the whole of Switzerland itself in the process and setting up the Helvetic Republic. Under Napoleon I (Emperor 1804–1815), Vaud became (1798–1803) the canton of Léman. Unrest about the abolition of feudal rights and taxes led to increased discontent, which culminated in the revolt of the Bourla-papey in spring 1802, closely followed by the Stecklikrieg (August to October 1802) that brought the end of the entire Helvetic Republic in 1803. In 1803 Vaud joined the re-installed Swiss Confederation. In spite of Bernese attempts to reclaim Vaud, it has remained a sovereign canton ever since.

In the 19th century, the canton of Vaud was an outspoken opponent of the &quot;Sonderbund&quot; Catholic separatist movement, which led to intervention by 99,000 Swiss Federal troops under General Henri Dufour against 79,000 separatists, in the Sonderbund War (November 1847). Separation was prevented at the cost of very few lives.

The current cantonal constitution dates from 14 April 2003, replacing the constitution of 1885.

==Geography==

The canton stretches from Lake Neuchâtel in the north, where it borders the canton of Neuchâtel, to Lake Geneva () in the south, where it borders the canton of Geneva, the French department of Haute-Savoie (lake border) and the canton of Valais (Chablais). In the Jura mountains in the west, the canton borders the French departments of Ain, Jura, and Doubs. In the east, it borders the cantons of Fribourg and Bern. The total area is .

Along with the canton of Berne, Vaud is one of the two cantons whose territory extends from the Jura to the Alps, through the three distinct geographic regions of Switzerland.

The areas in the south east are mountainous, situated on the north side of the Bernese Alps. This region is commonly named the &quot;Vaud Alps&quot; (). The Diablerets massif, peaking at , is the highest mountain of the canton. Other summits such as the Grand Muveran and the Tour d&#x27;Aï are visible from most of the canton. The area also hosts several popular skiing destinations such as Villars, Les Diablerets and Leysin.

The central area of the canton, in contrast, consists of moraines and is hilly. There are plains along the lakes. In the north, Avenches is in an exclave of the canton surrounded by the canton of Fribourg and Lake Neuchâtel. On the other hand, there are three enclaves of the canton of Fribourg (Estavayer-le-lac, Vuissens, Surpierre), as well as two enclaves of the canton of Geneva (Céligny), that are surrounded by the canton of Vaud.

The north-western part of the canton is also mountainous but in a more modest way with mountains generally not above ; the Jura Mountains. The Vallée de Joux is one of the most popular destinations in the region and also a centre of luxury mechanical Swiss watch manufacturing.

There is agriculture in the areas away from Lake Geneva. Sugar beet is important around Orbe, tobacco in La Broye Valley, and fruit at the foot of the Jura mountains. Cattle breeding and pasture are common in the Alps and the Jura mountains. There is a salt mine at Bex. Tourism is important in many towns along Lake Geneva.

<doc id="288704" wikidata="Q181684" url="?curid=288704" title="Against Me!">
<text>Against Me! is an American punk rock band, formed in 1997 in Naples, Florida, by singer and guitarist Laura Jane Grace. That same year, Grace moved to Gainesville, Florida, which is considered the band&#x27;s hometown. Since 2001, the band&#x27;s lineup has also included guitarist James Bowman. After releasing three studio albums through independent record labels, Against Me! moved to Sire Records for 2007&#x27;s &quot;New Wave&quot;, which reached no. 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 2011, the band launched the record label Total Treble.

In 2012, Grace publicly came out as a trans woman. After a long period of line-up changes and uncertainty surrounding the band&#x27;s future, their sixth studio album, &quot;Transgender Dysphoria Blues,&quot; was released independently in January 2014 to critical and commercial acclaim. The band&#x27;s seventh full-length, &quot;Shape Shift with Me&quot;, was released September 16, 2016.

Following the release of &quot;Shape Shift with Me&quot;, longtime bassist Andrew Seward rejoined the group in 2018. Though the group intended to record a new album, plans were derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the band entered an indefinite hiatus.

== History ==
===1997–2002: The early years and &quot;Reinventing Axl Rose&quot;===
Against Me! was formed in 1997 by singer/guitarist Laura Jane Grace as a solo act, amidst the breakup of her previous band(s). The first Against Me! release was an eponymously titled demo tape in 1997. It was self-released in very limited numbers. With the addition of drummer Kevin Mahon, a second demo, &quot;Vivida Vis!&quot; (1998), was released in limited numbers by Misanthrope Records. The band started their first tour in March 1999, a month-long tour of the East coast, during which they met Jordan Kleeman in Baltimore, Maryland. The band&#x27;s first EP, &quot;Against Me!&quot;, was released twice through Crasshole Records (once in 1999 and 2000). Grace&#x27;s longtime friend James Bowman joined the band for a west coast in support of the EP, traveling in Grace&#x27;s 1976 Buick LeSabre, the engine of which exploded at the end of the tour. Their first widely distributed release was the EP &quot;Crime as Forgiven by Against Me!&quot; (2001), released by Plan-It-X Records and Sabot Productions (run by longtime Against Me! tour manager Jordan Kleeman). While neither Bowman or Fridkin had part in the recording of &quot;Crime as Forgiven by Against Me!&quot;, they both joined the band on tour to support it. On April 23, 2001, while heading south on I-75, returning home from their first tour as a four-piece band, their van was struck by a semi truck. They landed upside-down in a ditch. No one was harmed, but the van and equipment were destroyed, after which Bowman and Mahon left the band. The band broke up for a few months that year. A third EP, a self-titled acoustic recording by Grace and bassist Dustin Fridkin, was released in November 2001.

Mahon was eventually replaced by Warren Oakes, and guitarist James Bowman returned in December 2001 during the recording of the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Against Me! Is Reinventing Axl Rose&quot;, released in March 2002 by No Idea Records. Fridkin left during the summer of 2002 to return to college and was replaced by Andrew Seward of the Tennessee band kill devil hills, and this new lineup released the single &quot;The Disco Before the Breakdown&quot; (2002). This lineup remained intact until 2009.

===2003–2006: &quot;As the Eternal Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Searching for a Former Clarity&quot; ===
Against Me! signed to Fat Wreck Chords and released their second album, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Against Me! as the Eternal Cowboy&quot;. It reached no. 36 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Independent Albums chart and was supported by singles for &quot;Cavalier Eternal&quot; and &quot;Sink, Florida, Sink&quot;. The DVD &quot;We&#x27;re Never Going Home&quot; followed, documenting their Spring 2004 tour. 2005&#x27;s &quot;Searching for a Former Clarity&quot; was their first album to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, reaching no. 114. Against Me! supported the album with a tour of all 50 U.S. states. It spawned singles for &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose Touch&quot; and &quot;From Her Lips to God&#x27;s Ears (The Energizer)&quot;, which also became the band&#x27;s first music videos. The live album &quot;Americans Abroad!!! Against Me!!! Live in London!!!&quot; followed in 2006.

=== 2007–2010: &quot;New Wave&quot; and &quot;White Crosses&quot; ===
Against Me! moved to Sire Records for 2007&#x27;s &quot;New Wave&quot;, produced by Butch Vig. It debuted at no. 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and featured their first charting single, &quot;Thrash Unreal&quot;, which reached no. 11 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks chart. &quot;White People for Peace&quot;, &quot;Stop!&quot;, and &quot;New Wave&quot; were also released as singles, and &quot;New Wave&quot; was named as &quot;Spin&quot;&#x27;s album of the year. The DVD &quot;Live at the Key Club&quot; followed later that year. In 2008, Against Me! supported Foo Fighters on a North American tour, and Sire released the digital EP &quot;New Wave B-Sides&quot;. In October 2008, while traveling west on I-80, en route to Salt Lake City, their tour bus hit a patch of ice; causing it to spin and land on its side in a ditch. No one was harmed.

For the 2008 presidential election, Against Me! partnered with Rock the Vote.

Oakes left the band in June 2009, in part to focus on running his Mexican food restaurant. In an interview with MTV Oakes wanted it to be known that he wasn&#x27;t fired, but rather, his leaving the band &quot;was really a mutual decision … it was really amicable.&quot; He said he still considers the band members to be &quot;more than friends -- they&#x27;re family,&quot; and added that Boca is already carrying Against Me! guitarist James Bowman&#x27;s homemade hot sauce on the menu.

Oakes was replaced by Hot Water Music drummer George Rebelo. The following month Fat Wreck Chords released &quot;The Original Cowboy&quot;, an album of demo recordings from the &quot;Against Me! as the Eternal Cowboy&quot; sessions.

Against Me! released &quot;White Crosses&quot;, their second album with Sire, on June 8, 2010 (although it was leaked about 3 months earlier). It was supported by singles for &quot;I Was a Teenage Anarchist&quot;, &quot;White Crosses&quot;, and &quot;High Pressure Low&quot; and was their highest-charting album to date, reaching no. 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On the eve of a scheduled tour of Australia and New Zealand that September, the band suddenly cancelled all touring plans due to &quot;a culmination of circumstances&quot;, expressing the need to &quot;take some time off from touring to go home and sort things out.&quot;

Against Me! departed from Sire Records on November 29, 2010. Following a two-month hiatus from touring, the band spoke for the first time since their tour cancellation, talking of their upcoming December 2010 shows, which saw Jay Weinberg cover for George Rebelo on drums, as he toured with Hot Water Music.

Throughout December 2010, Grace spoke of George Rebelo&#x27;s intentions to record an album with his primary band Hot Water Music. In January 2011, Weinberg was officially confirmed as Against Me!&#x27;s new drummer. &quot;Total Clarity&quot;, an album of demos and unreleased songs from the &quot;Searching for a Former Clarity&quot; sessions, was released on May 24, 2011, through Fat Wreck Chords.

===2011–2017: &quot;Transgender Dysphoria Blues&quot; and &quot;Shape Shift with Me&quot;===
In 2010 Grace had expressed the desire to release at least one album per year for the next decade.

On June 3, 2011, the band announced that they started their own record label, Total Treble. In July 2011, the band released &quot;Black Crosses&quot; which were demos /alternate versions of songs from &quot;White Crosses&quot;. In September 2011, Grace built a recording studio in Elkton, Florida, for future Against Me! projects. The studio has since been named Total Treble Studio. The first band to record an album in the studio were Cheap Girls from Lansing, Michigan, with their album &quot;Giant Orange&quot;.

In May 2012 Grace publicly came out as transgender, having dealt with gender dysphoria since childhood, and began her transition. &quot;I felt like I drop-kicked them in the face,&quot; she said of informing the other members of Against Me! &quot;We had the most awkward hug ever, and then they left. And the second I shut the door, I was like, &#x27;What the fuck did I just do? Gender dysphoria is the theme of the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, an autobiographical account of Laura Jane Grace&#x27;s experience as a trans woman and of social and body dysphoria. They began recording in February 2012 at Total Treble Studio, working without Butch Vig, who produced &quot;New Wave&quot; and &quot;White Crosses&quot;. Instead, Grace was acting as both recording engineer and record producer for the album. Weinberg departed the group that December. Drummer Atom Willard filled in with the band for their 2013 Australian tour dates, and was confirmed as the band&#x27;s new drummer on July 31, 2013. In March 2013, the band canceled their US tour with Bad Religion. In May 2013, bassist Andrew Seward also announced his departure from the band. Grace expressed that she felt the band wouldn&#x27;t have continued under the name Against Me! were it not for the then-upcoming record having a message she wanted to spread. On June 24, 2013, Grace announced that recording for &quot;Transgender Dysphoria Blues&quot; was finished. Grace went on a solo tour in August in a handful of east coast US cities in support of the record.

On July 15, 2013, Against Me! released the &quot;True Trans&quot; single for free, featuring the new acoustic song &quot;FUCKMYLIFE666&quot; and the namesake &quot;True Trans Soul Rebel&quot;. On August 29, 2013, Inge Johansson, formerly of the (International) Noise Conspiracy and Refused, was confirmed as the new bass player.

On January 21, 2014, Against Me! released &quot;Transgender Dysphoria Blues&quot;, their sixth full-length studio album. The album was praised for its raw quality, reminiscent of Against Me!&#x27;s earlier music. It is their highest-charting album to date, reaching no. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

A new live album, &quot;23 Live Sex Acts&quot; was recorded on the subsequent tour by the band in 2014, and was released on September 4, 2015.

In July 2016, the band announced their seventh studio album &quot;Shape Shift with Me&quot; would be released on September 16. The band also immediately released a song from the album, &quot;333&quot;. On August 10, 2016, a second song, &quot;Haunting, Haunted, Haunts&quot; was released via the Adult Swim Singles Program 2016. On September 8, the entire album was available for streaming.
&quot;Shape Shift with Me&quot;, was released September 16, 2016.

In October 2017, Against Me! played a special show with former bassist Dustin Fridkin for the first time since his departure from the band in 2002. The show was part of FEST 16. Grace revealed in August 2018 that she strongly considered disbanding Against Me! once this show had occurred.

===2018–2020: Seward&#x27;s return and &quot;2 Nights / 4 Records / 48 Songs&quot; tour===
Against Me! played their final show with bassist Inge Johansson in May 2018. The following month, the band played an unannounced show at Trumbullplex in Detroit, MI. The show was notable for being the first show with Andrew Seward playing bass since 2013, although no songs were played from &quot;Shape Shift with Me&quot;. Grace officially announced in July 2018 via Instagram that after performing these shows, Seward had rejoined the band.

In October 2018, the band played two shows on the eve of their South American tour: one with &quot;As the Eternal Cowboy&quot; played front to back, and the other with &quot;New Wave&quot;.

Laura Jane Grace announced in July 2018 that the band she had performed previous solo tours with since 2016, the Devouring Mothers, had recently completed a record together. &quot;Bought to Rot&quot; was released on Bloodshot Records on November 9, 2018. The band&#x27;s members since its inception have been Grace and Willard from Against Me!, as well as long-time producer and collaborator Marc Hudson. The album is said to be heavily influenced by the works of Rowland S. Howard and Tom Petty, and includes collaborations with other artists.

Grace later confirmed that Against Me! was still continuing as a band, with a &quot;clean slate&quot;, and that an eighth Against Me! record was still planned for eventual release. However, she also noted that it could be either shelved or re-recorded, following Seward&#x27;s replacement of Johansson as bassist.

The band recorded a cover of The Jim Carroll Band&#x27;s &quot;People Who Died&quot; for a 2018 compilation album (&quot;Songs That Saved My Life&quot;) in aid of mental health charities. The track was the first recording with Seward back as bassist since their 2011 single &quot;Russian Spies / Occult Enemies&quot;, and Grace used the announcement to further confirm that the band intend to record an eighth studio album together. The band began work on their eighth studio album in February 2019.

In May 2019, the band announced their &quot;2 Nights / 4 Records / 48 Songs&quot; tour. On this North American run, the band performed two shows in each city: The first dedicated to &quot;Searching for a Former Clarity&quot; and &quot;New Wave&quot;, the second dedicated to &quot;White Crosses&quot; and &quot;Transgender Dysphoria Blues&quot;. Support for the shows came from Chuck Ragan, Toy Guitar, Dilly Dally, Chris Cresswell, and Cursive. The band played its final show to date on March 12, 2020 at the Port City Music Hall – in turn, becoming the final band to ever perform there, due to the venue&#x27;s closure later that year on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===2020–present: Hiatus===
Grace released a solo album entitled &quot;Stay Alive&quot; in 2020, as well as an EP entitled &quot;At War with the Silverfish&quot; in 2021. Bowman began working as a guitar tech on tour with My Chemical Romance, while Seward formed the duo Nighttime Flyers and released a self-titled album independently in April 2022. Seward also joined As Friends Rust, initially as a touring and session musician, but ultimately becoming an official member and performing on their 2023 album &quot;Any Joy&quot; and their 2024 EP &quot;Lightless&quot;. Willard formed a new band, Plosivs, with members of Drive Like Jehu and Pinback. They released their debut self-titled album in March 2022. He also served as a touring drummer for both The Bronx and Worriers throughout 2022, and was announced as the new permanent drummer of Alkaline Trio in 2023.

In February 2024, while promoting her second solo album, &quot;Hole in My Head&quot;, Grace confirmed that Against Me! was still on hiatus as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic: &quot;We never broke up, but the pandemic fucked us up. It killed our momentum. It made apparent that there was a point of burnout. So that’s where we’ve been – everyone stepped away. People started doing other things and it got weird. I’m one person in the equation, and because I’m still out here playing the songs and putting out records and doing interviews, I’m always put to task to answer for it all. All I’m ever trying to do is demonstrate that I still want to do it. I go out every night and I still feel attached to the music and I still love playing music. I can’t speak for the other people, I can only speak for myself.&quot;

Grace, however, remained optimistic that the band would reunite in the future after &quot;reconnecting&quot; at her wedding: &quot;I don’t want to jinx anything. We’ll just have to see. But we didn’t break up, it just got weird. We’ll play again, I have faith in that. I just don’t know when that’ll be. I’m really hopeful for this year that we’ll start playing music again.&quot;

<text>Renens () is a municipality in the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. It is located in the district of Ouest Lausannois, and is a suburb of the city of Lausanne. It is the fourth largest city in the canton. It is considered a very multiethnic town, as more than 50% of the inhabitants are resident foreign nationals from about a hundred different countries.

==History==
Renens is first mentioned around 888-896 as &quot;in villa Runingis&quot;. Neolithic tombs (near Bourdonnette) and a necropolis from the High Middle Ages (near Caudrey) have been discovered in the town.

In the Middle Ages Renens was owned by the cathedral chapter of Lausanne which created a prebend there between 1233 and 1303. In 1555 Claude de Praroman exchanged his old Vuarrens prebend with Bern against that of Renens for which he obtained the lordship rights. The house he already owned at &#x27;En Plait&#x27; becomes his castle (Chateau de Renens). Lausanne bought the seigneury in 1750. The castle, sold in 1752 to Jean Pierre Audibert, passed successively to the Doxat, Sandoz, Sauter and Burckhardt families. There are rumors that Mozart stayed in this castle when he visited Lausanne.

Renens was around that time still a small village where a few families owned the countryside: the castle of &#x27;Renens-sur-Roche&#x27; (18th century) where the Roëlls, Auberjonois and Guyots succeeded each other, and the &#x27;Ferme des Tilleuls&#x27; (Tilia farm), built at the beginning of the 18th century by the Praroman family, where Pierre-Elie Bergier lived.

Renens became a municipality in 1798, attributed to the district of Lausanne (1798–2006) with its own municipal legislative Council from 1901. In the 1950s Renens became a city, and in 2006 the capital of the district of West-Lausanne.

==Geography==

Renens has an area, , of (depending on calculation method). Of this area, or 3.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 2.4% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 93.9% is settled (buildings or roads).

Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 13.9% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 41.6% and transportation infrastructure made up 28.7%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 3.4% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 6.4%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 1.0% is used for growing crops, while 1.7% is used for orchards or vine crops.

The municipality was part of the Lausanne District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and Renens became part of the new district of Ouest Lausannois.

The municipality is the capital of the new district of Ouest lausannois. It is part of the agglomeration of Lausanne, and Lausanne Métro line 1 terminates at Renens railway station.

<text>The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed by Finland and the Soviet Union on 12 March 1940, and the ratifications were exchanged on 21 March. It marked the end of the 105-day Winter War, upon which Finland ceded border areas to the Soviet Union. The treaty was signed by Vyacheslav Molotov, Andrei Zhdanov and Aleksandr Vasilevsky for the Soviet Union, and Risto Ryti, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, Rudolf Walden and Väinö Voionmaa for Finland. The terms of the treaty were not reversed after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Karelian question refers to the debate within Finland over the possible reacquisition of this ceded territory.

==Background==
The Winter War began on 30 November 1939 with the Soviet invasion of Finland. On 29 January 1940, Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov put an end to the puppet Terijoki Government and recognized the Ryti–Tanner government as the legal government of Finland, informing it that the Soviet Union was willing to negotiate peace. The Finnish government received the first tentative peace conditions from the Soviet Union (through Stockholm) two days later. The Soviets made larger claims than they had before the war started. The demands were for Finland to cede the Karelian Isthmus, including the city of Viipuri, and Finland&#x27;s shore of Lake Ladoga. The Hanko Peninsula was to be leased to the Soviet Union for 30 years.

Finland rejected the demands and intensified its pleas to Sweden, France and the United Kingdom for military support by regular troops. The reports from the front still held out hope for Finland, anticipating a League of Nations intervention. Positive signals, however inconstant, from France and Britain and more realistic expectations of troops from Sweden, for which plans and preparations had been made throughout the 1930s, were further reasons for Finland not to rush into peace negotiations. (See for more details.)

In February 1940, Finland&#x27;s commander-in-chief, Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim expressed his pessimism about the military situation, which prompted the government to start peace talks on 29 February, the same day the Red Army started an attack on Viipuri (now Vyborg).

== Terms ==
On 6 March, a Finnish delegation, led by Finnish Prime Minister Risto Ryti, travelled to Moscow. During the negotiations, the Red Army were close to surrounding Viipuri.

The treaty was signed on the evening of 12 March, Moscow Time, or 1 hour on 13 March, Finnish time. The protocol appended to the treaty stipulated that the fighting should end at noon, Leningrad time (11:00 Finnish time), and the fighting continued until then.

Finland ceded approximately half of Finnish Karelia, exceeding the amount of territory demanded by the Soviets before the war. The ceded area included Finland&#x27;s industrial centre, the city of Viipuri (Finland&#x27;s second-largest city [Population Register] or fourth-largest city [Church and Civil Register], depending on the census data), Käkisalmi, Sortavala, Suojärvi, and the whole of Viipuri Bay (with its islands). Much of this territory was still held by the Finnish Army. Military troops and remaining civilians were hastily evacuated inside the new border: 422,000 Finns, i.e. 12% of Finland&#x27;s population, left their homes.

There was also an area that the Russians captured during the war that remained in Finnish hands according to the treaty: Petsamo. The treaty also stipulated that Finland would grant free passage for Soviet civilians through Petsamo to Norway.

Finland also had to cede a part of the Salla area, the Finnish part of the Kalastajansaarento (Rybachi) Peninsula in the Barents Sea, and in the Gulf of Finland the islands of Suursaari, Tytärsaari, Lavansaari (now Moshchny Island о. Мощный), Peninsaari (now Maly Island, о. Малый) and Seiskari. Finally, the Hanko Peninsula was leased to the Soviet Union as a naval base for 30 years at an annual rent of 8 million marks. The total area ceded by Finland amounted to approximately 9% of its territory.

Contrary to a common belief, the Soviet troops&#x27; transfer rights by railway to the Hanko base were not granted in the peace treaty, but they were demanded on 9 July, after Sweden had acknowledged the railway transit of Wehrmacht troops to occupied Norway.

Additional demands were the handing over any equipment and installations on the territories that were ceded. Thus Finland had to hand over 75 locomotives, 2,000 railroad cars, and a number of cars, trucks and ships. The Enso industrial area, which was clearly on the Finnish side of the border, as it was drawn in the peace treaty, was also soon added to the Finnish losses of territory and equipment.

==Aftermath==
The Winter War and the subsequent peace treaty were core factors in leading to what would become the Continuation War, when hostilities resumed in 1941.

<text>Richard Aartsz, or Rijckaert Aertsz (1482 – May 1577) was a Dutch Renaissance painter of historical allegories. Most of his works were painted while he lived in Antwerp. He was a pupil of Jan Mostaert in Haarlem. Frans Floris became his pupil and friend.

==Biography==
Rykert (or Rijck) was born in Wijk aan Zee, (Beverwijk) and was the son of a fisherman. As a boy he had burned his leg, so he was sent to Haarlem for treatment, but because of an incompetent physician or because it was simply too late, the wound further deteriorated until his leg had to be amputated, which compelled him to walk with a crutch. This is why he was nicknamed &quot;Rijk met de Stelt&quot; (Rich with the Crutch), which is his now his best known artist name.

During his period of recovery, he often sat near the fire, and drew on the white stone hearth wall with charcoals, which he did so well that his parents asked if he would like to be a painter or draughtsman, and when he responded seriously in the affirmative, he was apprenticed to Jan Mostaert, then a master of a painting workshop in Haarlem. He was such a studious apprentice that he soon became a good artist himself. He painted the altar doors of the Carrier&#x27;s guild (&quot;Zakkendragersgilde&quot;, a guild for turf carriers and other cart trades) in the St. Bavochurch. The altar itself had been painted earlier by Jacob van Haarlem, the master of Mostaert. The altar door subjects were designed by Rijck, and were the history of Joseph (son of Jacob); one side was devoted to his brothers who came for grain, and the other side was Joseph himself seated like a king, hiding his identity for his brothers in Egypt; pieces which were highly praised. Rijck was a successful painter who painted many pieces in Friesland, but most of these were destroyed during the Beeldenstorm.

Rijck eventually traveled to Antwerp where he married Catharina Dircksdr and joined the Guild of Saint Luke in 1520. He was able to make a living by painting the &quot;flesh tones&quot; (&quot;naeckten&quot; can also mean nudes) for other painters in return for a day-wage. He died there in May 1577, famed as a quiet, happy, peaceful and pious man, much loved for his good mood. In reference to his name and crutch, he often said &quot;Ik ben rijk en wel gestelt&quot; (&quot;I am rich and well off&quot;, a pun on his name Rijckaert ( means &quot;rich&quot;, while means &quot;rich man&quot;), and having to use a crutch ( means &quot;with a crutch&quot;, while means &quot;well off&quot;).

In his old age, his vision was badly impaired, so that he was barely able to see what he was doing. When he put the paint on the panels so thickly that no one liked it, the paint often needed to be scraped off again, which upset him because he felt no one appreciated his work.

His portrait was painted by his friend Frans Floris around 1560, as the central figure in a painting of St. Luke for the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke, probably because he was an upbeat and popular character in the guild. He was the father of the painter Lambert Ryck Aertsz, called &quot;Robbesant&quot;.

<text>Nikolaus Ager, name also spelled Nicolas Ager and sometimes referred to as Agerius (1568, Ittenheim – 26 June 1634, Strasbourg) was a French physician and botanist born in Alsace. He was the author of the treatise &quot;De Anima Vegetativa&quot; (1629).

He studied medicine in Basel, subsequently obtaining doctorates in medicine and philosophy in Strasbourg. In 1618 he became a professor of medicine and botany at Strasbourg. During his career, he worked closely with famed botanists Johann and Gaspard Bauhin.

In 1763 Michel Adanson named the genus &quot;Ageria&quot; (family Aquifoliaceae) in his honor.

== Written works ==
From 1623 to 1634 he published a series of disputations, a few of them being: &quot;De vita et morte&quot;, &quot;De nutritione&quot;, &quot;De mente humana&quot;, &quot;De monstris&quot; and &quot;De somno et insomniis&quot;. In 1602 he published a new edition of Walther Hermann Ryff&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Reformierte Deütsche Apoteck&quot; (Reformed German chemist) as &quot;Newe ausgerüste deutsche Apoteck&quot;&quot;. The following are a list of some of his better known works:
* &quot;Theses physico-medicae de homine sano&quot;, 1593.
* &quot;Disputatio de dyssenteria&quot;, 1593.
* &quot;Disputatio de Zoophytis&quot;, 1625.
* &quot;De Anima Vegetativa&quot;, 1629.

<text>The basic exchange telephone radio service or BETRS is a fixed radio service where a multiplexed, digital radio link is used as the last segment of the local loop to provide wireless telephone service to subscribers in remote areas. BETRS technology was developed in the mid-1980s and allows up to four subscribers to use a single radio channel pair, , without interfering with one another.

In the US, this service may operate in the paired 152/158 and 454/459 MHz bands and on 10 channel blocks in the 816-820/861-865 MHz bands. BETRS may be licensed only to state-certified carriers in the area where the service is provided and is considered a part of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) by state regulators.

Regulation of this service currently resides in parts 1 and 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Subtitle 47 on Telecommunications, and may be researched or ordered through the Government Printing Office (GPO).

<text>The United States Government Publishing Office (USGPO or GPO), formerly the United States Government Printing Office, is an agency of the legislative branch of the United States Federal government. The office produces and distributes information products and services for all three branches of the Federal Government, including U.S. passports for the Department of State as well as the official publications of the Supreme Court, the Congress, the Executive Office of the President, executive departments, and independent agencies.

An act of Congress changed the office&#x27;s name to its current form in 2014.

==History==
=== Establishment of the Government Printing Office ===
The Government Printing Office was created by congressional joint resolution () on June 23, 1860. It began operations March 4, 1861, with 350 employees and reached a peak employment of 8,500 in 1972. The agency began transformation to computer technology in the 1980s; along with the gradual replacement of paper with electronic document distribution, this has led to a steady decline in the number of staff at the agency. 

=== Headquarters and unique architecture ===
For its entire history, the GPO has occupied the corner of North Capitol Street NW and H Street NW in the District of Columbia. The large red brick building that houses the GPO was erected in 1903 and is unusual in being one of the few large, red brick government structures in a city where most government buildings are mostly marble and granite. (The Smithsonian Castle and the Pension Building, now the National Building Museum, are other exceptions.) An additional structure was attached to its north in later years. 

=== Role and structure of the GPO ===
The activities of the GPO are defined in the public printing and documents chapters of Title 44 of the United States Code. The Director (formerly the Public Printer), who serves as the head of the GPO, is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Director selects a Superintendent of Documents.

=== Superintendent of Documents and information dissemination ===
The Superintendent of Documents (SuDocs) is in charge of the dissemination of information at the GPO. This is accomplished through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP), the Cataloging and Indexing Program and the Publication Sales Program, as well as operation of the Federal Citizen Information Center in Pueblo, Colorado. Adelaide Hasse was the founder of the Superintendent of Documents classification system.

=== Environmentally conscious initiatives ===
The GPO first used 100 percent recycled paper for the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; and &quot;Federal Register&quot; from 1991 to 1997, under Public Printers Robert Houk and Michael DiMario. The GPO resumed using recycled paper in 2009.

In March 2011, the GPO issued a new illustrated official history covering the agency&#x27;s 150 years of &quot;Keeping America Informed&quot;.

=== Name change and shift to digital publishing ===
With demand for print publications falling and a move underway to digital document production and preservation, the name of the GPO was officially changed to &quot;Government Publishing Office&quot; in a provision of an omnibus government funding bill passed by Congress in December 2014. Following signature of this legislation by President Barack Obama, the name change took place on December 17, 2014.

==Public Printers of the United States==

By law, the Public Printer heads the GPO. The position of Public Printer traces its roots back to Benjamin Franklin and the period before the American Revolution, when he served as &quot;publick printer&quot;, whose job was to produce official government documents for Pennsylvania and other colonies. When the agency was renamed in December 2014 the title &quot;Public Printer&quot; was also changed to &quot;Director&quot;. Davita Vance-Cooks was therefore the first &quot;Director&quot; of the GPO.

==Published government documents==

===Official journals of government===
The GPO contracts out much of the Federal government&#x27;s printing but prints the official journals of government in-house, 

* Public and Private Laws
* The &quot;Congressional Record&quot;
* The &quot;Federal Register&quot;, which is the official daily publication for rules, proposed rules, and notices of Federal agencies and organizations.
* United States &quot;House Journal&quot;
* &quot;United States Senate Journal&quot;
* United States Code
* United States Statutes at Large

===Passports===
GPO has been producing U.S. passports since the 1920s. The United States Department of State began issuing e-passports in 2006. The e-Passport includes an electronic chip embedded in the cover that contains the same information that is printed in the passport: name, date and place of birth, sex, dates of passport issuance and expiration, passport number, and photo of the bearer. GPO produces the blank e-Passport, while the Department of State receives and adjudicates applications and issues individual passports. GPO ceased production of legacy passports in May 2007, shifting production entirely to e-passports.

In March 2008, the &quot;Washington Times&quot; published a three-part story about the outsourcing of electronic passports to overseas companies, including one in Thailand that was subject to Chinese espionage.

===Trusted Traveler Program card===
GPO designs, prints, encodes, and personalizes Trusted Traveler Program cards (NEXUS, SENTRI and FAST) for the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

===GPO publications===

* &quot;Cumulative Copyright Catalogs&quot;
* &quot;Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion&quot; (1870–88)
* &quot;Official Records of the American Civil War&quot;
* &quot;U.S. Congressional Serial Set&quot;

GPO publishes the &quot;U.S. Government Publishing Office Style Manual&quot;. Among the venerable series are &quot;Foreign Relations of the United States&quot; for the Department of State (since 1861), and &quot;Public Papers of the Presidents&quot;, covering the administrations of Presidents Herbert Hoover onward (except Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose papers were privately printed). GPO published the &quot;Statistical Abstract of the United States&quot; for the Census Bureau from 1878 to 2012.

==Internet access to GPO publications==

In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed the GPO Electronic Information Access Enhancement Act, which enabled GPO to put Government information online for the first time. One year later, GPO began putting Government information online for the public to access. In 2009, GPO replaced its GPO Access website with the Federal Digital System, or FDsys. In 2016, GPO launched GovInfo, a mobile-friendly website for the public to access Government information. GovInfo makes available at no charge the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, the &quot;Federal Register&quot;, Public Papers of the Presidents, the U.S. Code, and other materials.

==GPO Police==
Security and law enforcement for GPO facilities is provided by the Government Publishing Office Police. The force is part of the GPO&#x27;s Security Services Division, and in 2003 it had 53 officers. Officers are appointed under Title 44 USC § 317 by the Public Printer (or their delegate). 

===Mission===
Their duty is to &quot;protect persons and property in premises and adjacent areas occupied by or under the control of the Government Printing Office&quot;. 

===Jurisdiction and Authority===
Officers are authorized to bear and use arms in the performance of their duties, make arrests for violations of Federal and state law (and that of Washington, D.C.), and enforce the regulations of the Public Printer, including requiring the removal from GPO premises of individuals who violate such regulations. 

Officers have concurrent jurisdiction with the law enforcement agencies where the premises are located. GPO Police Officers are required to maintain active certification with the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department as their agency holds a cooperative agreement with the city, granting GPO Police authority to enforce city laws and regulations to include Traffic Code.

<text>Căile Ferate Române (; abbreviated as the CFR) was the state railway carrier of Romania. The company was dissolved on 1 October 1998 by splitting into several successor companies. CFR as an entity existed from 1880, even though the first railway on current Romanian territory was opened in 1854. CFR was divided into four autonomous companies:
* &quot;CFR Călători&quot;, responsible for passenger services;
* &quot;CFR Marfă&quot;, responsible for freight transport;
* &quot;Compania Națională de Căi Ferate CFR&quot;, manages the infrastructure on the Romanian railway network; and
* &quot;Societatea Feroviară de Turism&quot;, or SFT, which manages scenic and tourist railways.

CFR was headquartered in Bucharest and had regional divisions centered in Bucharest, Brașov, Cluj-Napoca, Constanța, Craiova, Galați, Iași, and Timișoara. Its International Union of Railways code is 53-CFR.

==History==
===Railways in the nineteenth century===
The first railway line on Romania&#x27;s present-day territory was opened on 20 August 1854 and ran between Oravița in Banat and Baziaș, a port on the Danube. The line, which had a length of , was used solely for the transportation of coal. From 12 January 1855, the line was operated by Imperial Royal Privileged Austrian State Railway Company, the Banat province being at that time part of the Austrian Empire. After several improvements in the following months, the line was opened to passenger traffic from 1 November 1856.

Between 1864 and 1880, several railways were constructed in the area of the Kingdom of Romania. On 1 September 1865, the English company John Trevor-Barkley began construction on the Bucharest–Giurgiu line. Commissioned by the King of Romania, the line was opened to traffic on 26 August 1869. The Bucharest-Giurgiu line was the first railway built on Romanian territory at that time (considering that the Oravița-Baziaș line was part of Austria-Hungary, even though it now lies on Romanian territory).

In September 1866, the Romanian Parliament voted for the construction of a railway, from Vârciorova in the south to Roman in the north, via Ploiești, Bucharest, Buzău, Brăila, Galați, and Tecuci, all important population centres. The price for the construction was at that time 270,000 gold francs per kilometre and was contracted to the German Strousberg consortium. The line was opened in various stages, the first stage (Ploiesti–Bucharest–Galați–Roman) being opened to traffic on 13 September 1872, while the Vârciorova–Ploiești segment was opened some time later, on 9 May 1878. The Vârciorova-Roman line was an important part of Romania&#x27;s rail infrastructure because it spanned the entire Kingdom and provided an important connection for passengers and freight between several significant Wallachian and Moldavian cities.

On 10 September 1868, Bucharest&#x27;s Gara de Nord (North Station) was finalised. In January 1880, the Romanian Parliament voted to transfer the ownership of the Vârciorova-Roman line from the private administration of the Strousberg consortium to state ownership, under the administration of CFR. 1880 therefore marks the start of the &quot;Căile Ferate Române&quot; institution which survives to this date. The first administration of CFR was made up of Ioan Kalinderu, Eugeniu Stătescu, and Ștefan Fălcoianu.

In May 1868, the Romanian state concluded an agreement with another German consortium, known as the &quot;Offenheim Consortium&quot;, for the construction of several shorter railways in the region of Moldavia. The lines, which had a total length of , would run from Roman to Ițcani, from Pașcani to Iași and from Verești to Botoșani. In 1870, the Iași railway station was inaugurated and the lines were progressively opened from December 1869 to November 1871. Due to the poor management of the lines by the Offenheim Consortium, they were placed under the management of CFR in January 1889.

Meanwhile, during the Romanian War of Independence in 1877, Romania annexed the region of Dobrogea, which had previously belonged to the Ottoman Empire. The Romanian state placed under the management of CFR the Constanța–Cernavodă line, which had been opened during the Ottoman times in 1860. The Bucharest-Giurgiu line, the first line constructed in the Kingdom of Romania, was also placed under the administration of CFR during this time.

Hence, by 1889, the Romanian state became the owner of all of the lines in the Kingdom of Romania, the railway system having a total length of .

== Railways in the early twentieth century ==
In 1918, the historical regions of Transylvania, Banat, Bassarabia, and Bucovina united with the Kingdom of Romania to form Greater Romania. As a result, all railway lines in these regions, previously under the ownership of Austria-Hungary or the Russian Empire, were placed under the administration of CFR. This event was significant for Romanian railways because it meant that the large Arad rolling stock and steel factory, previously located on Austro-Hungarian territory, was now part of Romania, and was consequently used to produce a wide range of rolling stock and locomotives for CFR.

During this time, various railway lines were &quot;doubled&quot; — a second set of tracks were laid alongside the original tracks to permit trains to run in opposite directions simultaneously — to increase traffic flow on those routes. The first line to be doubled was the Bucharest–Ploiești–Câmpina line, where doubling was completed in 1912. In the period between the wars, various other lines were doubled, including:

* Constanța–Cernavodă (1931)
* Adjud–Tecuci (1933)
* Teiuș–Apahida (1940)
* Câmpina–Brașov (1941)
* Buzău–Mărășești (1942)

During the 1920s and 1930s CFR also bought several new locomotives and cars, embarking on a plan of widespread modernisation. Diesel traction was introduced, and the Malaxa high-speed DMUs (a modernised version of which are still in use as commuter trains in Banat) were built.

A significant event in the history of the railways was the Grivița Strike of 1933, which occurred during the Great Depression and resulted in violent clashes between railway workers and police.

== The Holocaust ==
During World War II, CFR (Romanian Railways) was involved in the transport of Jewish and Romani people from Bessarabia, Bukovina and Regat to concentration camps set up in Transnistria. In a notable example, during the Iași pogrom events, Jews were forcibly loaded onto freight cars with planks hammered in place over the windows and traveled for seven (7) days in unimaginable conditions. Many died and were gravely affected by lack of air, blistering heat, lack of water, food or medical attention. These veritable &quot;death trains&quot; arrived to their destinations, Podu Iloaiei and Călărași, with only one-fifth of their passengers alive. No official apology was released yet by CFR for their role in the Holocaust in Romania.

== Railways in Communist Romania ==
After Romania became a Communist republic in 1947, there was quite a significant amount of investment in railway infrastructure, often to the detriment of other forms of infrastructure. During this period, railways were seen as the symbol of Romania&#x27;s rapid industrialisation under Communist leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and later by Nicolae Ceaușescu. Aside from an increase in train traffic and the construction of various new lines, especially in rural areas, the bulk of electrification and line doubling occurred during the Communist period. Also, the railways in Southern Dobruja were left to Bulgaria in 1940 and the ones in Northern Bucovina and Bessarabia were ceded to the Soviet Union in 1947.

=== Electrification and track doubling ===
The first line to be electrified on the Romanian railway network was the Bucharest–Brașov line, which was used by a significant amount of passenger and freight traffic. Works on electrification started on 27 December 1960, and the first electrified segment, from Brașov to Predeal, opened on 9 December 1965. By 20 April 1966, a further segment was electrified, from Predeal to Câmpina. The entire line was electrified by 16 February 1969, at .

Various lines were also supplemented with double tracks to permit a wider flow of traffic, including:

* Făurei–Galați (1971)
* Pantelimon–Cernavodă (1971)
* Bucharest–Roșiori–Craiova (1972)
* Chitila–Golești (1972)
* Brașov–Câmpul Libertății (1974)
* Adjud–Suceava (1975)
* Dragalina–Călărași (1970s)

By the mid-1970s, steam traction disappeared completely out of mainstream use, being replaced by standardised diesel and electric locomotives and cars, most of which were built in Romania, at the Electroputere factory in Craiova, respectively Întreprinderea de Vagoane Arad (IVA) factory in Arad.

== CFR after 1989 ==

After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, which resulted in the fall of Communism, Romania was left with one of the largest, most dense and most frequently used railway networks in Europe; but at the same time having relatively outdated infrastructure. This, combined with the economic decline that Romania faced in the 1990s due to its transition to a market economy, resulted in CFR entering a period of relative decline. Several little-used routes, especially in rural areas, were cut back, and rolling stock, most of which was acquired in the 1970s, entered a period of disrepair. CFR&#x27;s image, both domestically and abroad, suffered greatly, due to reports of dilapidated trains, poor service and general disarray of management.

This situation continued until the year 1998, when &quot;Societatea Națională a Căilor Ferate Române&quot; (The National Society of Romanian Railways) was split into five independently administered companies : &quot;Compania Națională de Căi Ferate &quot;CFR&quot; SA&quot; (National Railway Company &quot;CFR&quot; – dealing with infrastructure), &quot;CFR Călători&quot; (CFR Passenger Services – the operator of passenger trains), &quot;CFR Marfă&quot; (Freight transport company), &quot;CFR Gevaro&quot; (Services linked with restaurant cars) and &quot;SAAF&quot; (dealing with excess rolling stock to be sold, leased or scrapped).

Since 1989, a number of small branch lines have been closed— especially those designated for industrial purposes or having a narrow gauge. This has been generally done due to greater competition from private bus services as well as generally low passenger numbers on those lines. The narrow gauge line from Turda to Abrud, for example, could not hope to compete with the private car or bus, the journey time being just short of six and a half hours for the trip (CFR Timetable 1988, table 309). As of 2022 the Turda–Abrud journey by bus takes 2 hours and 45 minutes.

Some other line closures were thought imminent especially on the branch lines in Timiș County, which were generally very old and little-used; but most seem to have been reprieved and now are operated by private operators. Between of railway lines have been divested of CFR control and a few have closed completely since 1990, most of which were in rural areas. Overall however, actual railway closures in Romania have been much less drastic than in other former Communist bloc countries, such as Hungary or Eastern Germany; indeed the &quot;closure&quot; figures given include lines which have been taken over by private operators and continue to operate (2010). Some standard gauge lines have in fact reopened since closure in the 1990s and some narrow-gauge tracks have recently been reopened by SFT (CFR&#x27;s Railway Tourism Society) for tourism, but are only run occasionally, about twice a month (lines include Abrud-Câmpeni, Târgu Mureș-Band or Moldovița-Vama). All forestry railroads (&quot;căi ferate forestiere&quot; in Romanian) still in operation after 1989 have been privatized and sold to the forestry companies. Some, such as the Vasser Valley Scenic Railroad, have since become significant tourist attractions.

==Modernization==

In the early 2000s, CFR began a modernization program to improve its image, which had been plagued both nationally and internationally by reports of poor service and outdated rolling stock. The first phases of the upgrade included the refurbishment of InterCity rolling stock, as well as the expansion of InterCity services.

To strengthen the growth of the Romanian InterCity network, CFR acquired in early 2003 several new Siemens Desiro train sets, some of which were assembled in Arad. Nicknamed &quot;Săgeata Albastră&quot; (&quot;Blue Arrow&quot;), they are used for short and medium distances. The Desiro DMUs were used as icons of the CFR&#x27;s modernization, despite criticism that the CFR should not have used them on mainline express services, as they were designed for short-distance commuter rail, as seen by their hard seating, low speed and poor noise insulation. CFR responded to these criticisms by introducing a number of new Desiro trainsets in late 2004, which had better insulation and 70 seats instead of 110, thereby increasing the width and pitch of the seats. To this date, CFR continues to use Desiro trains on short and medium-distance routes, even though it has replaced them on several long-distance routes with other rolling stock.

In addition to the Desiro DMUs, CFR has purchased 80 new sleeping cars, couchettes and first and second class cars in recent years. The new sleeping cars are now some of the most modern in Europe, with air conditioning, LCD screens and modern showers in every compartment.

In addition to the improvements made to the railways, CFR has modernized several diesel and electric locomotives.

Part of CFR&#x27;s modernization program is the XSELL project, which aims to introduce a Romania-wide electronic ticketing system. It was introduced at Bucharest North railway station in November 2004, and was later implemented at all major railway stations in Romania.

As of 1 September 2006, smoking is banned in all CFR trains.

CFR services continue to improve. However, some people expressed concern that CFR, which has yet to reach profitability, does not have the financial means to support an infrastructure upgrade.

Between 2001 and 2004, the Bucharest-Ploiești West-Câmpina section was rehabilitated, followed by the Câmpina-Sinaia-Predeal section between 2008/2009 and the end of 2011.

CFR initiated a major infrastructure project in April 2006 - the modernization of the Bucharest - Constanta line, in order to improve the maximum speed that can be reached on this line (from 140 km/h now, to 160 km/h in 2008). The completion date of this project was originally the second half of 2009, but the project had long delays, to be finally completed in the winter of 2011, although Ciulnița and Fetești railway stations were only partially modernized. The immediate consequence was the difficulty of moving on this route due to the works, the duration of a trip increasing by at least an hour and a half and leading to the dissatisfaction of travelers. But since 2012, when the works were officially completed, trains could run very fast, reducing journey times, reaching 160 km/h. Today, the only CFR railway where trains can run at 160 km/h is between Bucharest and Constanța in two hours.

==Passenger services==

CFR Călători, the passenger service division of CFR, operates seven &quot;types&quot; of passenger train, both on Romania&#x27;s territory, with rolling stock and locomotives, or internationally, with rolling stock. Also, CFR operates international trains on Romanian territory with its own locomotives. The train types vary in terms of speed and type of rolling stock.

In 2015, approximately 55 million passenger journeys were made with the company. In the same time 12 million further journeys were made using the private operators.

The CFR train types are:
* Regio (R) – the trains have assigned numbers from 2000 to 9999.
* InterRegio (IR) – the trains have assigned numbers from 200 to 499, 600 to 999, 1000 to 1999 and 10000 to 16999.
* InterCity (IC) – numbered from 500 to 599, discontinued in December 2014 but reintroduced on 10 December 2023.

===Regio trains===

Regio trains (regional), formerly Local (Romanian: &quot;Personal&quot;) trains (until December 2011), also termed commuter trains (&quot;navete&quot; or &quot;trenuri de navetiști&quot;), are the most abundant type of trains on the CFR passenger network. They are used for two main purposes, as shuttle, or commuter, trains, linking towns with neighbouring villages, and linking neighbouring cities with each other.
Local trains (now Regio), have the lowest average speed (34.3 km/h in 2004) and the least comfortable (usually oldest) rolling stock, and have a reputation for being very slow, crowded and generally unkempt which is only gradually changing. Regio trains operate mostly on local routes and stop at every station. Train fares for this type are the cheapest, since no supplement is paid, only the base fare, based on distance. Seats are not reservable. The rolling stock on Regio trains differs widely. On routes that link neighbouring cities with each other (such as Bucharest and Pitești), the quality of the rolling stock is much better than those services which provide a shuttle link between cities and rural areas (such as the Timișoara-Berzovia line).

Most Regio rolling stock consist of compartment single level and open-plan double-decker cars. As of 2007, most Regio trains, especially on rural routes, have only 2nd class cars. The livery of most Regio cars is painted in the color scheme of CFR Calatori (blue and grey), with the rolling stock built in the 1970s and 1980s. Some very short rural routes in Romania&#x27;s Bukovina region use rolling stock from the 1940s and 1950s, refitted with bus seats and operating like railbuses. CFR is refurbishing a range of double-decker Local (Regio) cars, that will be used on Local and Accelerat trains. The refurbished cars, painted in the same livery as the old ones, have been introduced since 2003, and are cleaner, although they still use most of the old fittings. Exceptions to this widespread use of older rolling stock for Local trains is found on some routes (such as Sibiu–Craiova) that are operated using Desiro trainsets, and some others are operated using modernized electric trainsets.

The new private operators also use the term &quot;Regio&quot; using mainly (refurbished) railbuses.

===InterRegio trains===
InterRegional trains (IR), formerly Accelerat and Rapid trains (until December 2011), are used for medium and long-distance services that stop only in towns or cities. InterRegional trains have higher speeds. They are also more expensive, requiring the payment of a supplement alongside the base fee. Some services of the InterRegional type require a reservation. InterRegional trains are also used for cross-regional long-distance routes (for example, Timișoara to Bucharest). Despite the long distances, InterRegional trains tend to stop in every town (even though they bypass villages) and hence are very popular, though they are seldom used for express travel between two large cities.

Since 2009, the InterRegio 1821/1822 from Arad to Constanța via Deva, Tîrgu Jiu, Craiova and Bucharest also travels to Constanța with an extra sleeperette car and sleeper car. The InterRegio rolling stock is formed of both single-decker cars painted in the painting scheme of CFR Calatori (blue and gray). Single-decker cars are all corridor-type, with the old cars having 8 seats per compartment in second class and 6 in first class whereas the new cars have 6 seats per compartment regardless of class (this type of coaches are used now for Regio Trains and rarely on InterRegio Trains). Double-decker cars have 4 seats per row in an open plan.

In early 2005, CFR introduced a new double-decker car for medium-distance, highly used Interregional routes such as Bucharest–Predeal. Siemens Desiro trainsets have also been introduced on medium-distance InterRegional routes in Transylvania and Moldavia (Iași–Vatra Dornei). Longer-distance InterRegional trains often have couchettes, and sleepers started to be added again to consists after a lengthy absence. Dining cars are never used on these trains. In the 2010 schedule, many short and medium distance routes (such as Bucharest–Craiova, Bucharest–Râmnicu Vâlcea–Sibiu, Bucharest–Tulcea, Craiova–Sibiu, Timișoara–Sibiu, Cluj-Napoca–Timișoara) were served by modernized double-decker cars or Desiro trainsets. Some long-distance trains (Bucharest–Timișoara, Bucharest–Târgu Jiu–Arad, Bucharest–Cluj-Napoca–Satu Mare, Bucharest–Iași, Bucharest–Vatra Dornei, Iași–Timișoara, Sighetu Marmației–Bucharest) also use modernized Rapid-style cars.


Rolling stock on InterRegional trains has recently been the object of CFR&#x27;s modernisation plan. Various series of cars have been refurbished, and fitted with air-conditioning, ecological toilets, etc. However, a small and rapidly declining number of Rapid rolling stock, mainly on lesser-used routes, remains fairly aged and outdated. As of 2004, Siemens Desiro DMUs have been introduced on medium-distance Rapid routes. Most Rapid rolling stocks are painted in the painting scheme of CFR Călători (blue and gray). All cars are uncompartmented and are usually air-conditioned. Sleepers, couchettes and dining-cars are available on most long routes.

*From Sighetu Marmației the Rapid train needs over 21 hours to complete the trip.
*From Satu Mare nearly 22 hours to complete the trip.
*From Oradea over 19 hours to complete the trip
*From Timișoara Nord over 15 hours to complete the trip.

In the case of travelling such a long distance as mentioned above, it is recommended to book a sleeperette (the passenger can choose between 4–6 passengers in a compartment). The 6 passenger-compartment is the cheapest option for a higher comfort. Fares and timetables can be checked on www.cfrcalatori.ro.

===InterCity ===
InterCity (IC) is CFR&#x27;s premier train type and is used for daytime express services between major cities, as well as shuttle services between Bucharest and the Black Sea coast and the Carpathian mountain resorts. InterCity trains typically only stop in large cities (generally of over 100,000 inhabitants). InterCity trains are the fastest out of all the train types, having an average speed of in 2004, and also use the most modern and comfortable rolling stock, rivaling the premier services of other European carriers. Due to this, InterCity prices include a significant supplement alongside the base fee.

The InterCity rolling stock is either new or refurbished (all IC rolling stock was built after 1995), with air-conditioning, power-plugs (in both 1st and 2nd class carriages) and plush bucket armchairs, as well as complimentary newspapers, free meals and airplane-like service in first class. These trains generally have a reputation for their high levels of comfort, cleanliness and service. The InterCity standard livery was usually grey and blue, especially in the case of the C160-class rolling stock, which is the newest type. Most InterCity rolling stock is open plan (no compartments). When CFR bought the Desiro DMUs, they were mostly used for InterCity trains, but due to complaints related to their comfort levels, they were replaced with standard cars for most routes and now the Desiro DMUs are used for the Regio trains.

Express passenger and international IC services, such as the Bucharest-Constanța route, use the Romanian-built Astra AVA-200 cars, which have a maximum speed of and are the most comfortable rolling stock in the CFR fleet. In fact, according to Friends of CFR, a Romanian railway journal, there was a considerable downgrading in quality when the Bucharest–Vienna IC service switched from being operated by CFR to being run by Austrian Railways (ÖBB) in 2003, leading to numerous complaints that the route should revert to CFR cars instead of Austrian ÖBB cars.

Beginning with December 2006, the company introduced the business service on certain IC routes (București Nord–Timișoara Nord, București Nord–Oradea). These wagons were refurbished by CFR Grivița and they provided two classes: standard and standard exclusive. According to class, these rail cars provide leather or fabric-covered armchairs, monitors, individual displays for every seat, 4 channel audio system with earphones, wireless internet access, bar, air conditioning, and they were equipped with an elevator for disabled travellers. As of 1 June 2014, InterCity trains used to operate on the following routes:

Before early 2003, there was also a train type known as InterCityExpress (ICE), which ran from Bucharest to Constanța, but these have been discontinued and transformed into IC and later into IR, while maintaining the same rolling stock.

Because of the bad infrastructure as of 2015 InterCity trains are not in use anymore because the fare was too high. There are some trains which are running like InterCity but with InterRegio cost. Now the rolling stock used before 2015 for Intercity trains is used now for the InterRegio trains.

===Speeds===
The speed limit for express passenger trains in Romania is . All other trains have a general speed limit of . Average operating speeds (including all stops in stations) according to CFR, are in 2018:

* 39 km/h for Regio trains
* 55 km/h for InterRegio trains

The longest train route, as of 2005, is the one between Iași, in the north-east, and Timișoara, in the west, which takes 18 hours with an Interregio train to complete. For example, the journey between Suceava Burdujeni and Bucharest is 447 km, and takes approximately 5–6 hours to complete at an average speed of 80 km/h.

==Freight services==

Freight services in Romania are operated mostly by CFR Marfă, the freight division of CFR, as well as by 28 other private companies who operate on lines leased from CFR Infrastructură. The CFR Marfă fleet is made up of 987 locomotives, most of which were built in Romania or the former Yugoslavia. The fact that rail freight remains maintains a strong market share in Romania, as well as a number of efficiency reforms, has led CFR Marfă to perform quite well financially in recent years, even though it remains loss-making. In 2003, the CFR Marfă&#x27;s net loss was 8.8 million new lei (approximately US$3 million), reduced from 141.5 million new lei in 2002.

Freight trains follow the same speed limits to those issued for passenger trains, although hazardous materials, explosive, nuclear, flammable, chemical or otherwise dangerous trains have a special regime. Most locomotives have a physical speed limit of 160 or 120 km/h, but freight trains are not usually running at speeds exceeding 100 km/h.

==Main lines==

==Locomotives and stock==
CFR Călători (passenger services) and CFR Marfă (freight services) use a range of electric (known as LE), diesel electric (LDE), diesel hydraulic (LDH) and diesel mechanical (LDM/LDMM) locomotives. SFT (tourist railways division) uses steam locomotives (both narrow gauge and standard gauge) and diesel mechanical locomotives.

Each of the four CFR divisions have their own locomotives, and these are generally not interchanged. For example, a CFR Marfă locomotive should not be used to pull a CFR Călători train. In practice however, this rule does not hold, and frequently the companies use other rolling stock through informal lease agreements. Moreover, private companies&#x27; rolling stock is used at times, usually because of emergencies (such as a locomotive breaking down and requiring a replacement to keep the line open, and an unused private locomotive being closer).

===Electric locomotives===
Most of the electric locomotives employed by CFR were built by Electroputere Craiova (known as EA-type) and Rade Končar Zagreb (known as EC-type). All are built for and run using a catenary wire at . All trains have electric heating. CFR owns 1,066 electric locomotives, 933 of which were built by Electroputere (Class 40, 41, 42) and 133 built by Končar (Class 43, 44, 46).

===Diesel locomotives===

CFR&#x27;s diesel locomotives have been built by Electroputere Craiova (classes 60 to 68) and FAUR Bucharest (classes 69 to 95).

Classes 60 and 62 have as prime mover a twin-bank cylinder Sulzer 12LDA28 diesel engine rated at 2100 hp@750rpm, being derated from its nominal power by a smaller turbocharger and a lower max rpm. The difference between classes 60 and 62 is that the class 62 features traction motors certified and capable of pulling passenger coaches at 120 km/h instead of the 100 km/h allowed for class 60.

Classes 63 and 65 are modified by replacing Sulzer engines with 2 stroke 8 cylinders EMD 8-710G which develop 2150 hp at crankshaft at 900 rpm, the generators were replaced with alternators and DC traction motors were replaced with new ones. Class 63 has a max speed of 120 km/h while class 65 is limited to 100 km/h. 63 and 65 are in service for CFR Călători only for passenger coaches&#x27; traction. 63 and 65 do not feature Dynamic Braking Systems available in North America.

The following classes are in service:

===Diesel multiple units===
CFR Călători uses diesel multiple units (DMUs) mainly for passenger services on shorter and little-used lines, even though the Siemens Desiro DMUs have also been used for InterRegio and InterCity services on longer distances.

===Electric multiple units===
A 6-car regional EMU built by Electroputere was used from 1975 to 1997, although they were rare, only 8 being made. By June 2006, there were no electric multiple units (EMUs) in service. However, CFR bought some second-hand Z-6100 and Z-6300 EMUs from SNCF, and their CFL version 250 with 2 cars and 260 with 3 cars, which were modernised by Remarul 16 Februarie in Cluj-Napoca and were used for commuter trains, as class 58, until 2020 when they were withdrawn. The last one to be used was 58-1007-2 (Z-6316).

<text>Grease 2 is a 1982 American musical romantic comedy film, and a standalone sequel to the 1978 film &quot;Grease&quot;, adapted from the 1971 musical of the same name by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. Originally titled &quot;More Grease&quot;, the film was produced by Allan Carr and Robert Stigwood, and directed and choreographed by Patricia Birch, who choreographed the original stage production and prior film. The plot returns to Rydell High School two years after the original film&#x27;s graduation, with a largely new cast, led by Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer in her first starring role.

The film was released in United States theaters on June 11, 1982, and grossed $15 million against a production budget of $11 million, a far cry from its predecessor&#x27;s $132 million domestic box office. Despite breakthrough roles for Pfeiffer, Adrian Zmed, and Christopher McDonald, the film received mostly negative reviews from critics; however, &quot;Grease 2&quot; maintains a devoted fan base decades after its release.

==Plot==
It is 1961, three years after the events of the prior film, and the first day of school has arrived (&quot;Alma Mater&quot; from the original stage musical). Principal McGee and her secretary, Blanche, react as the students—including the laid-back, ruffian T-Birds, and their trendy, “bad-girl” counterparts, the Pink Ladies—arrive at high school (&quot;Back to School Again&quot;). The Pink Ladies are now led by Stephanie Zinone, who feels she has &quot;outgrown&quot; her relationship with her ex-boyfriend Johnny Nogerelli, the arrogant, chauvinistic (and rather immature) bully leader of the motorcycle-riding T-Birds.

A new arrival comes in the form of clean-cut British student Michael Carrington (a cousin of Sandy Olsson from the previous film). He is introduced to the school atmosphere by former Pink Lady Frenchy, who agreed to help show Michael around. Frenchy has returned to Rydell to obtain her diploma so she can start her own cosmetics company (as preluded with “Beauty School Dropout” in the previous film). Michael eventually meets Stephanie, and quickly becomes smitten with her.

At the local bowling alley, a game (&quot;Score Tonight&quot;) turns sour from the animosity between Johnny and Stephanie. Stephanie retaliates by kissing the next man who walks in the door, who happens to be Michael. Bemused by this unexpected kiss, Michael falls in love with Stephanie. He asks her out, but learns she has a very specific vision of her ideal man (&quot;Cool Rider&quot;). After realizing how he can win her affection, Michael gets to work on acquiring a motorcycle. Michael begins to covertly accept payments from the T-Birds to write their term papers and uses the cash to buy a motorcycle. Substitute teacher Mr. Stuart leads a rousing biology lesson (&quot;Reproduction&quot;).

A rival gang called the Cycle Lords (including members of the defunct Scorpions), led by Leo Balmudo, surprises the T-Birds at the bowling alley. Before a fight ensues, a lone, mysterious “Cool Rider” biker appears (actually Michael, in disguise), defeats the enemy gang, and disappears into the night (&quot;Who&#x27;s That Guy?&quot;). Stephanie is fascinated with this stranger. Meanwhile, T-Bird Louis attempts to trick his sweetheart, Pink Lady Sharon, into losing her virginity to him by taking her to a fallout shelter and faking a nuclear attack (&quot;Let&#x27;s Do It for Our Country&quot;).

The next evening while working at a gas station/auto garage, Stephanie is surprised again by the Cool Rider, and they enjoy a romantic twilight motorcycle ride, which includes a kiss. Just as Michael is about to reveal his identity, they are interrupted by the arrival of the T-Birds and Pink Ladies. Before Michael departs, he tells Stephanie that he will see her at the school talent show. Johnny, enraged by Stephanie&#x27;s new romance, threatens to fight the Cool Rider if he sees him with her again. The Pink Ladies walk away haughtily, but this has little effect on the T-Birds&#x27; self-confidence (&quot;Prowlin&#x27;&quot;).

At school, Stephanie&#x27;s poor grades in English lead her to accept Michael&#x27;s offer of help. Johnny, upon seeing them together in a discussion, demands that Stephanie quit the Pink Ladies to preserve his honor. Although still enchanted by the mysterious Cool Rider, interactions with Michael reveal that she has become romantically interested in him now, as well. Michael ponders over the continuing charade he is putting on for Stephanie (&quot;Charades&quot;).

At the talent show, Stephanie and the Cool Rider meet up but are abruptly ambushed by the T-Birds, who pursue Michael on their respective motorcycles, with Stephanie, Sharon, Paulette, and Rhonda following in a car. They chase him to a construction site which conceals a deadly drop, and the biker&#x27;s absence suggests that he has gone over the edge and perished, leaving Stephanie heartbroken and inconsolable. Johnny and his T-Birds remove the competing Preptones – preppie boys – by tying them to a shower pole in the boys&#x27; locker room and drenching them. During the Pink Ladies&#x27; performance in the talent show (&quot;Girl for All Seasons&quot;), Stephanie enters a dreamlike, fantasy world, where she is reunited with her mystery biker (&quot;(Love Will) Turn Back the Hands of Time&quot;). She is named winner of the contest, and crowned the Queen of the upcoming graduation luau; likewise, Johnny is hailed as King for his performance of &quot;Prowlin&#x27;&quot;, along with his fellow T-Birds.

The school year ends with the luau (&quot;Rock-a-Hula Luau (Summer Is Coming)&quot;), during which the Cycle Lords appear and begin to disrupt the celebration. The Cool Rider then reappears, defeats the Cycle Lords again, and reveals his true identity as Michael. Initially shocked, Johnny gives him a T-Birds jacket, officially welcoming him into the gang, and Stephanie is delighted that she can now be with him. Michael and Stephanie share a passionate kiss, and he whispers that he loves her. All the couples pair-off happily, as the graduating class sings (&quot;We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot;). The credits start rolling in yearbook-style, as in the original film (&quot;Back to School Again&quot;).

==Production==

===Development===
&quot;Grease&quot; co-producer Allan Carr had a deal with Paramount Pictures to be paid $5 million to produce a sequel, with production beginning within three years of the original film. Carr decided to hire Patricia Birch as director for the sequel, as she had previously served as the choreographer for the stage and film versions of &quot;Grease&quot;. Birch was initially hesitant to accept after learning that neither composers Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey nor John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John would be involved in the film. Bronte Woodard, the writer who adapted the original stage material for the original film, had died in 1980, and Canadian comic Ken Finkleman (who was also writing and directing &quot;Airplane II&quot; at the same time) was tasked with penning a new script mostly from scratch. The total budget for the production was $11.2 million, almost double the budget of the original. Birch&#x27;s approach to the material was to hew closer to the original, grittier stage productions from which &quot;Grease&quot; came; she had resisted changes made to the original film (largely made at Newton-John&#x27;s behest) but was overruled.

&quot;Grease 2&quot; was intended to be the second film (and first sequel) in a proposed &quot;Grease&quot; franchise of four films and a television series. (The third and fourth films were to take place in the 1960s and during the counterculture era.) However, the projects were scrapped due to the underwhelming box office performance of &quot;Grease 2&quot;. Maxwell Caulfield was unhappy with the film&#x27;s &quot;drab&quot; title, and unsuccessfully lobbied to change it to &quot;Son of Grease&quot;.

===Casting===
Birch proposed an idea to feature Travolta and Newton-John reprising their characters as a now married couple running a gas station near the end of the film, with Travolta to sing a new number &quot;Gas Pump Jockey;&quot; this did not come to fruition. Newton John rejected the offer to return, as she was more interested in doing &quot;Xanadu&quot;. Paramount tried to get Jeff Conaway and Stockard Channing from the first film to do cameos but this did not happen (Channing, by then 37 years old, had left Hollywood for a time in the early 1980s to focus on her stage career). Early plans for &quot;Grease 2&quot; had Conaway and Channing&#x27;s characters, Kenickie and Rizzo, as main characters while they attended summer school, which would have culminated in the two getting married.

Andy Gibb was screen tested to play the male lead but this proved unsatisfactory. At one stage Timothy Hutton was announced as the male lead, and Carr later claimed after &quot;Grease 2&quot; was released &quot;Hutton came, sang, and danced in my living room. He had done Guys and Dolls in college, and that’s who I wanted and preferred. But they didn’t consider him sexy enough.”

Maxwell Caulfield was cast after impressing producers off-Broadway in &quot;Entertaining Mr. Sloane&quot;. Having seen his performances, Allan Carr offered Caulfield the role of Michael over thousands of applicants.

“They were all in love with Maxwell,” said Patricia Birch. “Robert and Allan saw him onstage without his clothes.&quot;

Unlike co-star Pfeiffer, Caulfield&#x27;s career following &quot;Grease 2&quot; was damaged by the film&#x27;s failure. He has been quoted as saying: &quot;Before &quot;Grease 2&quot; came out, I was being hailed as the next Richard Gere or John Travolta. However, when &quot;Grease 2&quot; flopped, nobody would touch me. It felt like a bucket of cold water had been thrown in my face. It took me 10 years to get over &quot;Grease 2&quot;.&quot;

With only a few television roles and small film appearances, Michelle Pfeiffer, then aged 23, was a relatively unknown actress when she attended the casting call audition for the role of Stephanie. Other actresses considered for the part included Lisa Hartman, Kristy McNichol, Andrea McArdle, and singer Pat Benatar. Pfeiffer was a wild card choice, but according to Birch, she won the part because she &quot;has a quirky quality you don&#x27;t expect.&quot; She later commented on being cast:

That was really weird for me. I&#x27;d been taking singing lessons and I had taken dance, because I loved to dance, but I had never considered myself a professional at all. I went on this audition as a fluke, and somehow, through the process of going back and dancing, and then going back and singing, I ended up getting the part. I went crazy with that movie. I came to New York and the paparazzi were waiting at the hotel. I know the producers put them up to it. I am basically very private, and I&#x27;m really nervous about doing publicity. Every time I set up an interview, I say, &quot;That&#x27;s it, this is my last one. I&#x27;ll do this because I committed to doing it, but I&#x27;m never doing another one.&quot; It was insane.

Lorna Luft was the last star cast. The part played by Connie Stevens was originally meant for Annette Funicello but she was unable to appear because her schedule as Skippy peanut butter spokeswoman did not allow her time to film the scene.

Adrian Zmed had previously played the role of Danny Zuko in the stage version of &quot;Grease&quot;, a role he would later reprise in the 1990s.

===Filming===
Scenes at Rydell High School were filmed at Excelsior High School, a recently closed high school in Norwalk, California. Filming took place throughout a 58-day shooting schedule during the autumn of 1981. According to director Birch, the script was still incomplete when filming commenced. Sequences that were filmed but cut during post-production include scenes in which Frenchy helps Michael become a motorcycle rider, and a sequence at the end of the film showing Michael and Stephanie flying off into the sky on a motorcycle.

In the film, after Stephanie wins the contest, it goes on to show the luau in the final scene. Originally, there were a few minutes dedicated to a scene in which Michael (believed to be dead in his alter ego, by Stephanie) comes out on stage as Stephanie is exiting the stage, unbeknownst to her that he is the cool rider and he is alive. He attempts to ask her what&#x27;s wrong and she storms past him and runs off crying, then it cuts to the luau. There was a scene within the &quot;Who&#x27;s that Guy?&quot; number in which Goose accidentally smashes Rhonda&#x27;s nose at the Bowl-A-Rama door. None of these scenes have been shown since the film&#x27;s release.

==Release==

===Box office===
The sequel took in just over $15 million after coming at fifth on opening weekend behind &quot;E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, &quot;Rocky III&quot;, and &quot;Poltergeist&quot;.

Caulfield said &quot;basically we just got blown off the map by that little movie by Spielberg.&quot;

===Critical response===
, on Rotten Tomatoes, the film had an approval rating of 35% based on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus read: &quot;&quot;Grease 2&quot; is undeniably stocked with solid songs and well-choreographed dance sequences, but there&#x27;s no getting around the fact that it&#x27;s a blatant retread of its far more entertaining predecessor.&quot; , on Metacritic it had a score of 52% based on reviews from 11 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; condemned the film as &quot;dizzy and slight, with an even more negligible plot than its predecessor had. This time the story can&#x27;t even masquerade as an excuse for stringing the songs together. Songs? What songs? The numbers in &quot;Grease 2&quot; are so hopelessly insubstantial that the cast is forced to burst into melody about pastimes like bowling.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; commended the staging of the musical numbers, writing that Patricia Birch has come up with some unusual settings (a bowling alley, a bomb shelter) for some of the scenes, and employs some sharp montage to give most of the songs and dances a fair amount of punch.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 2 stars out of 4, saying: &quot;This movie just recycles &quot;Grease&quot;, without the stars, without the energy, without the freshness and without the grease.&quot;

Pfeiffer received positive notices for her first major role. &quot;The New York Times&quot; review cited her performance as the &quot;one improvement&quot; on the original film: &quot;Miss Pfeiffer is as gorgeous as any cover girl, and she has a sullen quality that&#x27;s more fitting to a &quot;Grease&quot; character than Miss Newton-John&#x27;s sunniness was.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that she was &quot;all anyone could ask for in the looks department, and she fills Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s shoes and tight pants very well.&quot; Pfeiffer told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; three years later:

Barry Diller of Paramount said that the film &quot;on no level is as good as the first. The quality isn&#x27;t there.&quot;

Jim Jacobs described it at the time as &quot;awful ... the pits.&quot; In an interview 27 years later, Jacobs noted that &quot;Grease 2&quot; &quot;still brings a brief frown to his face.&quot;

During an appearance for &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; to promote the film &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot;, actor Andrew Garfield cited the film as one of his five favorite musicals, calling it &quot;great&quot;.

===Accolades===
Pfeiffer was nominated for a 1983 Young Artist Award in the category of Best Young Motion Picture Actress.

The film was nominated for a Stinkers Bad Movie Awards for Worst Picture. Later on, the Stinkers would unveil their picks for the 100 worst films of the 20th century with their &quot;100 Years, 100 Stinkers&quot; list. &quot;Grease 2&quot; ranked in the listed bottom 20 at #13.

The film was given a special screening at the 2021 online TCM Festival.

==Remakes==
The film&#x27;s screenplay was adapted in the Kannada (South India) feature film &quot;Premaloka&quot;, starring Ravichandran and Juhi Chawla, released in 1987, which went on to become a blockbuster.

==Plans for a third film==
In 2003, Olivia Newton-John confirmed that a second sequel was being developed. &quot;They&#x27;re writing it, and we&#x27;ll see what happens. If the script looks good, I&#x27;ll do it. But I haven&#x27;t seen the script, and it has to be cleverly done.&quot; Newton-John died in 2022 before any such script was completed.

In 2008, it was reported that Paramount was planning a new sequel to &quot;Grease&quot; that would debut straight to DVD. However, the project never came to fruition.

In 2019, it was announced that a prequel to the original film entitled &quot;Summer Lovin&quot;&#x27; with John August attached to write the screenplay was in the works at Paramount.

==Stage musical==
The film was later adapted into a musical, &quot;Cool Rider&quot;, with the script re-written and modified for the stage.

<doc id="289406" wikidata="Q275157" url="?curid=289406" title="Blood sugar level">
<text>The blood sugar level, blood sugar concentration, blood glucose level, or glycemia is the measure of glucose concentrated in the blood. The body tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis.

For a 70 kg (154 lb) human, approximately four grams of dissolved glucose (also called &quot;blood glucose&quot;) is maintained in the blood plasma at all times. Glucose that is not circulating in the blood is stored in skeletal muscle and liver cells in the form of glycogen; in fasting individuals, blood glucose is maintained at a constant level by releasing just enough glucose from these glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle in order to maintain homeostasis. Glucose can be transported from the intestines or liver to other tissues in the body via the bloodstream. Cellular glucose uptake is primarily regulated by insulin, a hormone produced in the pancreas. Once inside the cell, the glucose can now act as an energy source as it undergoes the process of glycolysis.

In humans, properly maintained glucose levels are necessary for normal function in a number of tissues, including the human brain, which consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasting, sedentary individuals. A persistent elevation in blood glucose leads to glucose toxicity, which contributes to cell dysfunction and the pathology grouped together as complications of diabetes.

Glucose levels are usually lowest in the morning, before the first meal of the day, and rise after meals for an hour or two by a few millimoles per litre.

Abnormal persistently high glycemia is referred to as hyperglycemia; low levels are referred to as hypoglycemia. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia from a variety of causes, and it is the most prominent disease related to the failure of blood sugar regulation. Diabetes mellitus is also characterized by frequent episodes of low sugar, or hypoglycemia. There are different methods of testing and measuring blood sugar levels.

Drinking alcohol causes an initial surge in blood sugar and later tends to cause levels to fall. Also, certain drugs can increase or decrease glucose levels.

There are two ways of measuring blood glucose levels: In the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries (Australia, Canada, India, etc.) and ex-USSR countries molar concentration, measured in mmol/L (millimoles per litre, or millimolar, abbreviated mM). In the United States, Germany, Japan and many other countries mass concentration is measured in mg/dl (milligrams per decilitre).

Unit conversion formula from mmol/L to mg/dL

formula_1

Since the molecular mass of glucose C6H12O6 is 180.156 g/mol, the factor between the two units is about 18, so 1 mmol/L of glucose is equivalent to 18 mg/dL.

formula_2

==Normal value range==

===Humans===
Normal blood glucose level (tested while fasting) for non-diabetics should be 3.9–5.5 mmol/L (70–100 mg/dL).

According to the American Diabetes Association, the fasting blood glucose target range for diabetics, should be 3.9 - 7.2 mmol/L (70 - 130 mg/dL) and less than 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) two hours after meals (as measured by a blood glucose monitor).

Normal value ranges may vary slightly between laboratories. Glucose homeostasis, when operating normally, restores the blood sugar level to a narrow range of about 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L (79 to 110 mg/dL) (as measured by a fasting blood glucose test).

The global mean fasting plasma blood glucose level in humans is about 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL); however, this level fluctuates throughout the day. Blood sugar levels for those without diabetes and who are not fasting is usually below 6.9 mmol/L (125 mg/dL).

Despite widely variable intervals between meals or the occasional consumption of meals with a substantial carbohydrate load, human blood glucose levels tend to remain within the normal range. However, shortly after eating, the blood glucose level may rise, in non-diabetics, temporarily up to 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) or slightly more. 

The actual amount of glucose in the blood and body fluids is very small. In a healthy adult male of with a blood volume of 5 L, a blood glucose level of 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) amounts to 5 g, equivalent to about a teaspoonful of sugar. Part of the reason why this amount is so small is that, to maintain an influx of glucose into cells, enzymes modify glucose by adding phosphate or other groups to it.

===Other animals===

In general, ranges of blood sugar in common domestic ruminants are lower than in many monogastric mammals. However this generalization does not extend to wild ruminants or camelids. For serum glucose in mg/dL, reference ranges of 42 to 75 for cows, 44 to 81 for sheep, and 48 to 76 for goats, but 61 to 124 for cats; 62 to 108 for dogs, 62 to 114 for horses, 66 to 116 for pigs, 75 to 155 for rabbits, and 90 to 140 for llamas have been reported. A 90 percent reference interval for serum glucose of 26 to 181 mg/dL has been reported for captured mountain goats (&quot;Oreamnos americanus&quot;), where no effects of the pursuit and capture on measured levels were evident. For beluga whales, the 25–75 percent range for serum glucose has been estimated to be 94 to 115 mg/dL. For the white rhinoceros, one study has indicated that the 95 percent range is 28 to 140 mg/dL. For harp seals, a serum glucose range of 4.9 to 12.1 mmol/L [i.e. 88 to 218 mg/dL] has been reported; for hooded seals, a range of 7.5 to 15.7 mmol/L [i.e. about 135 to 283 mg/dL] has been reported.

==Regulation==
The body&#x27;s homeostatic mechanism keeps blood glucose levels within a narrow range. It is composed of several interacting systems, of which hormone regulation is the most important.

There are two types of mutually antagonistic metabolic hormones affecting blood glucose levels:
* catabolic hormones (such as glucagon, cortisol and catecholamines) which increase blood glucose;
* and one anabolic hormone (insulin), which decreases blood glucose.

These hormones are secreted from pancreatic islets (bundles of endocrine tissues), of which there are four types: alpha (A) cells, beta (B) cells, Delta (D) cells and F cells. Glucagon is secreted from alpha cells, while insulin is secreted by beta cells. Together they regulate the blood-glucose levels through negative feedback, a process where the end product of one reaction stimulates the beginning of another reaction. In blood-glucose levels, insulin lowers the concentration of glucose in the blood. The lower blood-glucose level (a product of the insulin secretion) triggers glucagon to be secreted, and repeats the cycle.

In order for blood glucose to be kept stable, modifications to insulin, glucagon, epinephrine and cortisol are made. Each of these hormones has a different responsibility to keep blood glucose regulated; when blood sugar is too high, insulin tells muscles to take up excess glucose for storage in the form of glycogen. Glucagon responds to too low of a blood glucose level; it informs the tissue to release some glucose from the glycogen stores. Epinephrine prepares the muscles and respiratory system for activity in the case of a &quot;fight or flight&quot; response. Lastly, cortisol supplies the body with fuel in times of heavy stress.

==Abnormalities==
===High blood sugar===
If blood sugar levels remain too high the body suppresses appetite over the short term. Long-term hyperglycemia causes many health problems including heart disease, cancer, eye, kidney, and nerve damage.

Blood sugar levels above 16.7mmol/L (300mg/dL) can cause fatal reactions. Ketones will be very high (a magnitude higher than when eating a very low carbohydrate diet) initiating ketoacidosis. The ADA (American Diabetes Association) recommends seeing a doctor if blood glucose reaches 13.3 mmol/L (240 mg/dL), and it is recommended to seek emergency treatment at 15mmol/L (270mg/dL) blood glucose if Ketones are present. The most common cause of hyperglycemia is diabetes. When diabetes is the cause, physicians typically recommend an anti-diabetic medication as treatment. From the perspective of the majority of patients, treatment with an old, well-understood diabetes drug such as metformin will be the safest, most effective, least expensive, and most comfortable route to managing the condition. Treatment will vary for the distinct forms of Diabetes and can differ from person to person based on how they are reacting to treatment. Diet changes and exercise implementation may also be part of a treatment plan for diabetes.

Some medications may cause a rise in blood sugars of diabetics, such as steroid medications, including cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, prednisone, and dexamethasone.

===Low blood sugar===

When the blood sugar level is below 70 mg/dL, this is referred to as having low blood sugar. Low blood sugar is very frequent among type 1 diabetics. There are several causes of low blood sugar, including, taking an excessive amount of insulin, not consuming enough carbohydrates, drinking alcohol, spending time at a high elevation, puberty, and menstruation. If blood sugar levels drop too low, a potentially fatal condition called hypoglycemia develops. Symptoms may include lethargy, impaired mental functioning; irritability; shaking, twitching, weakness in arm and leg muscles; pale complexion; sweating; loss of consciousness.

Mechanisms that restore satisfactory blood glucose levels after extreme hypoglycemia (below 2.2 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) must be quick and effective to prevent extremely serious consequences of insufficient glucose: confusion or unsteadiness and, in the extreme (below 0.8 mmol/L or 15 mg/dL) loss of consciousness and seizures. Without discounting the potentially quite serious conditions and risks due to or oftentimes accompanying hyperglycemia, especially in the long-term (diabetes or pre-diabetes, obesity or overweight, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, etc.), it is still generally more dangerous to have too little glucose – especially if levels are very low – in the blood than too much, at least temporarily, because glucose is so important for metabolism and nutrition and the proper functioning of the body&#x27;s organs. This is especially the case for those organs that are metabolically active or that require a constant, regulated supply of blood sugar (the liver and brain are examples). Symptomatic hypoglycemia is most likely associated with diabetes and liver disease (especially overnight or postprandial), without treatment or with wrong treatment, possibly in combination with carbohydrate malabsorption, physical over-exertion or drugs. Many other less likely illnesses, like cancer, could also be a reason. Starvation, possibly due to eating disorders, like anorexia, will also eventually lead to hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemic episodes can vary greatly between persons and from time to time, both in severity and swiftness of onset. For severe cases, prompt medical assistance is essential, as damage to brain and other tissues and even death will result from sufficiently low blood-glucose levels.

==Glucose measurement==

In the past to measure blood glucose it was necessary to take a blood sample, as explained below, but since 2015 it has also been possible to use a continuous glucose monitor, which involves an electrode placed under the skin. Both methods, as of 2023, cost hundreds of dollars or euros per year for supplies needed.

===Sample source===
Glucose testing in a fasting individual shows comparable levels of glucose in arterial, venous, and capillary blood. But following meals, capillary and arterial blood glucose levels can be significantly higher than venous levels. Although these differences vary widely, one study found that following the consumption of 50 grams of glucose, &quot;the mean capillary blood glucose concentration is higher than the mean venous blood glucose concentration by 35%.&quot;

===Sample type===
Glucose is measured in whole blood, plasma or serum. Historically, blood glucose values were given in terms of whole blood, but most laboratories now measure and report plasma or serum glucose levels. Because red blood cells (erythrocytes) have a higher concentration of protein (e.g., hemoglobin) than serum, serum has a higher water content and consequently more dissolved glucose than does whole blood. To convert from whole-blood glucose, multiplication by 1.14 has been shown to generally give the serum/plasma level.

To prevent contamination of the sample with intravenous fluids, particular care should be given to drawing blood samples from the arm opposite the one in which an intravenous line is inserted. Alternatively, blood can be drawn from the same arm with an IV line after the IV has been turned off for at least 5 minutes, and the arm has been elevated to drain infused fluids away from the vein. Inattention can lead to large errors, since as little as 10% contamination with a 5% glucose solution (D5W) will elevate glucose in a sample by 500 mg/dL or more. The actual concentration of glucose in blood is very low, even in the hyperglycemic.

===Measurement techniques===

Two major methods have been used to measure glucose. The first, still in use in some places, is a chemical method exploiting the nonspecific reducing property of glucose in a reaction with an indicator substance that changes color when reduced. Since other blood compounds also have reducing properties (e.g., urea, which can be abnormally high in uremic patients), this technique can produce erroneous readings in some situations (5–15 mg/dL has been reported). The more recent technique, using enzymes specific to glucose, is less susceptible to this kind of error. The two most common employed enzymes are glucose oxidase and hexokinase. Average blood glucose concentrations can also be measured. This method measures the level of glycated hemoglobin, which is representative of the average blood glucose levels over the last, approximately, 120 days.

In either case, the chemical system is commonly contained on a test strip which is inserted into a meter, and then has a blood sample applied. Test-strip shapes and their exact chemical composition vary between meter systems and cannot be interchanged. Formerly, some test strips were read (after timing and wiping away the blood sample) by visual comparison against a color chart printed on the vial label. Strips of this type are still used for urine glucose readings, but for blood glucose levels they are obsolete. Their error rates were, in any case, much higher. Errors when using test strips were often caused by the age of the strip or exposure to high temperatures or humidity. More precise blood glucose measurements are performed in a medical laboratory, using hexokinase, glucose oxidase, or glucose dehydrogenase enzymes.

Urine glucose readings, however taken, are much less useful. In properly functioning kidneys, glucose does not appear in urine until the renal threshold for glucose has been exceeded. This is substantially above any normal glucose level, and is evidence of an existing severe hyperglycemic condition. However, as urine is stored in the bladder, any glucose in it might have been produced at any time since the last time the bladder was emptied. Since metabolic conditions change rapidly, as a result of any of several factors, this is delayed news and gives no warning of a developing condition. Blood glucose monitoring is far preferable, both clinically and for home monitoring by patients. Healthy urine glucose levels were first standardized and published in 1965 by Hans Renschler.

A noninvasive method of sampling to monitor glucose levels has emerged using an &quot;exhaled breath condensate&quot;. However this method does need highly sensitive glucose biosensors.

===Clinical correlation===
The fasting blood glucose level, which is measured after a fast of 8 hours, is the most commonly used indication of overall glucose homeostasis, largely because disturbing events such as food intake are avoided. Conditions affecting glucose levels are shown in the table below. Abnormalities in these test results are due to problems in the multiple control mechanism of glucose regulation.

The metabolic response to a carbohydrate challenge is conveniently assessed by a postprandial glucose level drawn 2 hours after a meal or a glucose load. In addition, the glucose tolerance test, consisting of several timed measurements after a standardized amount of oral glucose intake, is used to aid in the diagnosis of diabetes.

Error rates for blood glucose measurements systems vary, depending on laboratories, and on the methods used. Colorimetry techniques can be biased by color changes in test strips (from airborne or finger-borne contamination, perhaps) or interference (e.g., tinting contaminants) with light source or the light sensor. Electrical techniques are less susceptible to these errors, though not to others. In home use, the most important issue is not accuracy, but trend. Thus if a meter / test strip system is consistently wrong by 10%, there will be little consequence, as long as changes (e.g., due to exercise or medication adjustments) are properly tracked. In the US, home use blood test meters must be approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration before they can be sold.

Finally, there are several influences on blood glucose level aside from food intake. Infection, for instance, tends to change blood glucose levels, as does stress either physical or psychological. Exercise, especially if prolonged or long after the most recent meal, will have an effect as well. In the typical person, maintenance of blood glucose at near constant levels will nevertheless be quite effective.

<text>The computer art scene, or simply artscene, is the community interested and active in the creation of computer-based artwork.

==Early computer art==
The history of computer art predates the computer art scene for several decades, with the first experiments having taken place in the early 1950s. Devices like plotters and teletypewriters were commonly used instead of video display screens. The earliest precursors to ASCII art can be found in RTTY art, that is, pictures created by amateur radio enthusiasts with teleprinters using the Baudot code.

In the early days of microcomputers, what could be shown on a typical video display screen was limited to plain and simple text, such as that found in the ASCII code set. In the early 1980s, users of IBM PC compatible computers began to experiment with ways of forming simple pictures and designs using only the 255 characters within the Extended ASCII character set, specifically known as code page 437, created by IBM. Modems and networking technology allowed computer users to communicate with each other over bulletin board systems (BBSes); the operators of these BBSes used ASCII art to enhance the aesthetic appearance of their systems. The common user interface or video mode shared by all systems was plain text. As a result, a &quot;scene&quot; of artists arose to fill the need for original art to distinguish one BBS from another.

==Evolving technology==

===At home===

At a time when IBM PC compatibles were limited to monochrome graphics or the four preset colors of the Color Graphics Adapter, the Atari 8-bit computers had a palette of 128 colors and could display 4-8 of those at once—or many more with custom programming. The Commodore 64 could display 16 fixed colors.

In 1985, the  Amiga arrived with the ability to display 640x480 4096-color graphics that could be exported via the NTSC standard. This capability was used by Disney animators in movies such as &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and by TV producers in shows such as &quot;SeaQuest&quot; and &quot;Babylon 5&quot;.

===Online===
As computer technology developed, the American National Standards Institute X3 committee invented a standard method of terminal control using escape sequences called &quot;ANSI X3.64-1979&quot;. This protocol allowed for text and cursor positioning as well as defining foreground and background color attributes for the text.

Eventually, text artists began incorporating this new level of flexibility to the existing medium of ASCII art by adding color to their text-based art, or animating their art by manipulating the cursor control codes. This is what is commonly referred to today as &quot;ANSI art&quot; that is used in many scene nfos.

A decade later, the popularity of ANSI art had increased significantly (largely due to the similarly increasing interest in the BBS) and ANSI artists began to form into &quot;groups&quot;, not unlike graffiti &quot;crews.&quot; The first ANSI group was called Aces of ANSI Art (AAA). Though no official founding date can be established for this group, its earliest surviving tribute packs are dated December 1991 and includes art dated back to 1989.

Other groups like ACiD (ANSI Creators in Demand) and iCE (Insane Creators Enterprises) quickly began to spring up. Beginning in June 1992, these groups would release their work in monthly &quot;ARTPACKS,&quot; which were collections of ASCII art submitted by the group&#x27;s various members, as well as news and membership lists. These artpacks were then spread far and wide by BBS users. Some of the same groups from the 1990s still exist today; their art is now primarily distributed using the internet.

A later method of transmitting graphics over a BBS was developed called Remote Imaging Protocol or RIP, which required special software on both the BBS and the terminal end. RIP was still basically text, but the text referred to the positions of lines, curves, fills, and other steps in drawing graphics on an EGA display of 640x350x16 colors. While RIP never caught on in the BBS world, the art scene embraced it as a form of expression, if not a viable method of displaying art on a BBS.

==VGA to present day==
In 1987 IBM introduced the VGA card. Early VGA graphics were &quot;high resolution&quot; images, generally using an 8-bit depth (256 colors) and a resolution of 320x200x256, 360x480x256 (hacked Mode X), or 640x480x16 colors. VGA was not intended to be displayed via a BBS and the vast majority of the early works in the IBM PC artscene were distributed as coded executables called &quot;&quot;loaders&quot; or &quot;intros&quot; rather than raw bitmap images. In fact, it was considered to be &quot;lame&quot;&quot; to release an uncoded VGA work of art from the early- to mid-1990s, a sure indication that your group was not skilled enough to retain a worthy programmer.

The advent of custom image viewers developed by groups within the artscene, such as ACiD View and iCEView, began to shift the perception of how VGA art should be distributed and what the accepted practice should be. A coded VGA which did not take any of the advantages of being an executable, like special effects or music, became viewed as an impractical use of disk space—all of this in turn spawned a number of competing image viewers, and even &quot;Viewer Wars&quot; between rival art groups. Talented underground artists such as CatBones continued to help pioneer and define what is now referred to as the &quot;hirez artscene&quot;, further championing the move away from coded VGA to stand-alone imagery with his impressive artwork. &quot;Hirez&quot; today implies higher resolutions than before, such as a 1024x768 pixel canvas or larger, greater depth of color, and is created with much more sophisticated and modern software.

==Underground status==
Despite the fact that contributors to the artscene can be found worldwide, the scene remains detached from mainstream bbs and internet culture. This can be seen as a result of the artscene&#x27;s early affiliations with hacker and software piracy (warez) organizations. As early demoscene groups were organized by cracktros coders, artscene members were often found designing the .nfo files detailing warez releases. In addition much of the ansi art provided for warez BBSes was drawn by future members of the artscene. Prior to the popularity of the internet in the 1990s, the most efficient way to distribute software and files across BBSes was via a courier system. Both the warez scene and the artscene utilized this system, and in many cases warez couriers could be found distributing monthly artpacks.

In addition to connection that the various underground groups had, a common attitude and relationship between scene members developed. The general belief that &quot;newbies are lame&quot; and &quot;veterans are elite&quot;, as well as the use of leetspeek, created an environment that was sometimes difficult for new members to enter. In particular, many artsceners&#x27; distrust and bitterness towards new America Online users in the 1990s may have eroded the possibility for a wider membership base and audience for the artscene.

<doc id="289419" wikidata="Q918145" url="?curid=289419" title="Firestorm">
<text>A firestorm is a conflagration which attains such intensity that it creates and sustains its own wind system. It is most commonly a natural phenomenon, created during some of the largest bushfires and wildfires. Although the term has been used to describe certain large fires, the phenomenon&#x27;s determining characteristic is a fire with its own storm-force winds from every point of the compass towards the storm&#x27;s center, where the air is heated and then ascends. 

The Black Saturday bushfires, the 2021 British Columbia wildfires, and the Great Peshtigo Fire are possible examples of forest fires with some portion of combustion due to a firestorm, as is the Great Hinckley Fire. Firestorms have also occurred in cities, usually due to targeted explosives, such as in the aerial firebombings of London, Hamburg, Dresden, and Tokyo, and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

==Mechanism==
A firestorm is created as a result of the stack effect as the heat of the original fire draws in more and more of the surrounding air. This draft can be quickly increased if a low-level jet stream exists over or near the fire. As the updraft mushrooms, strong inwardly-directed gusty winds develop around the fire, supplying it with additional air. This would seem to prevent the firestorm from spreading on the wind, but the tremendous turbulence created may also cause the strong surface inflow winds to change direction erratically. Firestorms resulting from the bombardment of urban areas in the Second World War were generally confined to the areas initially seeded with incendiary devices, and the firestorm did not appreciably spread outward. 

A firestorm may also develop into a mesocyclone and induce true tornadoes/fire whirls. This occurred with the 2002 Durango fire, and probably with the much greater Peshtigo Fire. The greater draft of a firestorm draws in greater quantities of oxygen, which significantly increases combustion, thereby also substantially increasing the production of heat. The intense heat of a firestorm manifests largely as radiated heat (infrared radiation), which may ignite flammable material at a distance ahead of the fire itself. This also serves to expand the area and the intensity of the firestorm. Violent, erratic wind drafts suck movables into the fire and as is observed with all intense conflagrations, radiated heat from the fire can melt some metals, glass, and turn street tarmac into flammable hot liquid. The very high temperatures ignite anything that might possibly burn, until the firestorm runs low on fuel.

A firestorm does not appreciably ignite material at a distance ahead of itself; more accurately, the heat desiccates those materials and makes them more vulnerable to ignition by embers or firebrands, increasing the rate of fire spotting. During the formation of a firestorm many fires merge to form a single convective column of hot gases rising from the burning area and strong, fire-induced, radial (inwardly directed) winds are associated with the convective column. Thus the fire front is essentially stationary and the outward spread of fire is prevented by the in-rushing wind.

==Characterization of a firestorm==
A firestorm is characterized by strong to gale-force winds blowing toward the fire, everywhere around the fire perimeter, an effect which is caused by the buoyancy of the rising column of hot gases over the intense mass fire, drawing in cool air from the periphery. These winds from the perimeter blow the fire brands into the burning area and tend to cool the unignited fuel outside the fire area so that ignition of material outside the periphery by radiated heat and fire embers is more difficult, thus limiting fire spread. At Hiroshima, this inrushing to feed the fire is said to have prevented the firestorm perimeter from expanding, and thus the firestorm was confined to the area of the city damaged by the blast.

Large wildfire conflagrations are distinct from firestorms if they have moving fire fronts which are driven by the ambient wind and do not develop their own wind system like true firestorms. (This does not mean that a firestorm &quot;must&quot; be stationary; as with any other convective storm, the circulation may follow surrounding pressure gradients and winds, if those lead it onto fresh fuel sources.) Furthermore, non-firestorm conflagrations can develop from a single ignition, whereas firestorms have only been observed where large numbers of fires are burning simultaneously over a relatively large area, with the important caveat that the density of simultaneously burning fires needs to be above a critical threshold for a firestorm to form (a notable example of large numbers of fires burning simultaneously over a large area without a firestorm developing was the Kuwaiti oil fires of 1991, where the distance between individual fires was too large).

The high temperatures within the firestorm zone ignite most everything that might possibly burn, until a tipping point is reached, that is, upon running low on fuel, which occurs after the firestorm has consumed so much of the available fuel within the firestorm zone that the necessary fuel density required to keep the firestorm&#x27;s wind system active drops below the threshold level, at which time the firestorm breaks up into isolated conflagrations.

In Australia, the prevalence of eucalyptus trees that have oil in their leaves results in forest fires that are noted for their extremely tall and intense flame front. Hence the bush fires appear more as a firestorm than a simple forest fire. Sometimes, emission of combustible gases from swamps (e.g., methane) has a similar effect. For instance, methane explosions enforced the Peshtigo Fire.

===Weather and climate effects===
Firestorms will produce hot buoyant smoke clouds of primarily water vapor that will form condensation clouds as it enters the cooler upper atmosphere, generating what is known as pyrocumulus clouds (&quot;fire clouds&quot;) or, if large enough, pyrocumulonimbus (&quot;fire storm&quot;) clouds. For example, the black rain that began to fall approximately 20 minutes after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima produced in total 5–10 cm of black soot-filled rain in a 1–3 hour period. Moreover, if the conditions are right, a large pyrocumulus can grow into a pyrocumulonimbus and produce lightning, which could potentially set off further fires. Apart from city and forest fires, pyrocumulus clouds can also be produced by volcanic eruptions due to the comparable amounts of hot buoyant material formed.

On a more continental and global extent, away from the direct vicinity of the fire, wildfire firestorms that produce pyrocumulonimbus cloud events have been found to &quot;surprisingly frequently&quot; generate minor &quot;nuclear winter&quot; effects. These are analogous to minor volcanic winters, with each mass addition of volcanic gases additive in increasing the depth of the &quot;winter&quot; cooling, from near-imperceptible to &quot;year without a summer&quot; levels.

====Pyro-cumulonimbus and atmospheric effects (in wildfires) ====
A very important but poorly understood aspect of wildfire behavior are pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) firestorm dynamics and their atmospheric impact. These are well illustrated in the Black Saturday case study below. The &quot;pyroCb&quot; is a fire-started or fire-augmented thunderstorm that in its most extreme manifestation injects huge abundances of smoke and other biomass-burning emissions into the lower stratosphere. The observed hemispheric spread of smoke and other biomass-burning emissions has known important climate consequences. Direct attribution of the stratospheric aerosols to pyroCbs only occurred in the last decade.

Such an extreme injection by thunderstorms was previously judged to be unlikely because the extratropical tropopause is considered to be a strong barrier to convection. Two recurring themes have developed as pyroCb research unfolds. First, puzzling stratospheric aerosol-layer observations—and other layers reported as volcanic aerosol can now be explained in terms of pyroconvection. Second, pyroCb events occur surprisingly frequently, and they are likely a relevant aspect of several historic wildfires.

On an intraseasonal level it is established that pyroCbs occur with surprising frequency. In 2002, at least 17 pyroCbs erupted in North America alone. Still to be determined is how often this process occurred in the boreal forests of Asia in 2002. However, it is now established that this most extreme form of pyroconvection, along with more frequent pyrocumulus convection, was widespread and persisted for at least two months. The characteristic injection height of pyroCb emissions is the upper troposphere, and a subset of these storms pollutes the lower stratosphere. Thus, a new appreciation for the role of extreme wildfire behavior and its atmospheric ramifications is now coming into focus.

=== Black Saturday firestorm (Wildfire case study) ===
==== Background ====
The Black Saturday bushfires are some of Australia&#x27;s most destructive and deadly fires that fall under the category of a &quot;firestorm&quot; due to the extreme fire behavior and relationship with atmospheric responses that occurred during the fires. This major wildfire event led to a number of distinct electrified pyrocumulonimbus plume clusters ranging roughly 15 km high. These plumes were proven susceptible to striking new spot fires ahead of the main fire front. The newly ignited fires by this pyrogenic lightning further highlight the feedback loops of influence between the atmosphere and fire behavior on Black Saturday associated with these pyroconvective processes.

==== Role that pyroCbs have on fire in case study ====
The examinations presented here for Black Saturday demonstrate that fires ignited by lightning generated within the fire plume can occur at much larger distances ahead of the main fire front&quot;—&quot;of up to 100 km. In comparison to fires ignited by burning debris transported by the fire plume, these only go ahead of the fire front up to about 33 km, noting that this also has implications in relation to understanding the maximum rate of spread of a wildfire. This finding is important for the understanding and modeling of future firestorms and the large scale areas that can be affected by this phenomenon. 

As the individual spot fires grow together, they will begin to interact. This interaction will increase the burning rates, heat release rates, and flame height until the distance between them reaches a critical level. At the critical separation distance, the flames will begin to merge and burn with the maximum rate and flame height. As these spot fires continue to grow together, the burning and heat release rates will finally start to decrease but remain at a much elevated level compared to the independent spot fire. The flame height is not expected to change significantly. The more spot fires, the bigger the increase in burning rate and flame height.

==== Importance for continued study of these firestorms ====
Black Saturday is just one of many varieties of firestorms with these pyroconvective processes and they are still being widely studied and compared. In addition to indicating this strong coupling on Black Saturday between the atmosphere and the fire activity, the lightning observations also suggest considerable differences in pyroCb characteristics between Black Saturday and the Canberra fire event. Differences between pyroCb events, such as for the Black Saturday and Canberra cases, indicate considerable potential for improved understanding of pyroconvection based on combining different data sets as presented in the research of the Black Saturday pyroCb&#x27;s (including in relation to lightning, radar, precipitation, and satellite observations).

A greater understanding of pyroCb activity is important, given that fire-atmosphere feedback processes can exacerbate the conditions associated with dangerous fire behavior. Additionally, understanding the combined effects of heat, moisture, and aerosols on cloud microphysics is important for a range of weather and climate processes, including in relation to improved modeling and prediction capabilities. It is essential to fully explore events such as these to properly characterize the fire behavior, pyroCb dynamics, and resultant influence on conditions in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). It is also important to accurately characterize this transport process so that cloud, chemistry, and climate models have a firm basis on which to evaluate the pyrogenic source term, pathway from the boundary layer through cumulus cloud, and exhaust from the convective column.

Since the discovery of smoke in the stratosphere and the pyroCb, only a small number of individual case studies and modeling experiments have been performed. Hence, there is still much to be learned about the pyroCb and its importance. With this work scientists have attempted to reduce the unknowns by revealing several additional occasions when pyroCbs were either a significant or sole cause for the type of stratospheric pollution usually attributed to volcanic injections.

==City firestorms==

The same underlying combustion physics can also apply to human-made structures such as cities during war or natural disaster.

Firestorms are thought to have been part of the mechanism of large urban fires, such as accompanied the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. Genuine firestorms are occurring more frequently in California wildfires, such as the 1991 wildfire disaster in Oakland, California, and the October 2017 Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa, California. 

During the July–August 2018 Carr Fire, a deadly fire vortex equivalent in size and strength to an EF-3 tornado spawned during the firestorm in Redding, California and caused tornado-like wind damage. Another wildfire which may be characterized as a firestorm was the Camp Fire, which at one point travelled at a speed of up to 76 acres per minute, completely destroying the town of Paradise, California within 24 hours on November 8, 2018.

Firestorms were also created by the firebombing raids of World War II in cities like Hamburg and Dresden. Of the two nuclear weapons used in combat, only Hiroshima resulted in a firestorm. In contrast, experts suggest that due to the nature of modern U.S. city design and construction, a firestorm is unlikely after a nuclear detonation.

===Firebombing===

Firebombing is a technique designed to damage a target, generally an urban area, through the use of fire, caused by incendiary devices, rather than from the blast effect of large bombs. Such raids often employ both incendiary devices and high explosives. The high explosive destroys roofs, making it easier for the incendiary devices to penetrate the structures and cause fires. The high explosives also disrupt the ability of firefighters to douse the fires.

Although incendiary bombs have been used to destroy buildings since the start of gunpowder warfare, World War II saw the first use of strategic bombing from the air to destroy the ability of the enemy to wage war. London, Coventry, and many other British cities were firebombed during the Blitz. Most large German cities were extensively firebombed starting in 1942, and almost all large Japanese cities were firebombed during the last six months of World War II. As Sir Arthur Harris, the officer commanding RAF Bomber Command from 1942 through to the end of the war in Europe, pointed out in his post-war analysis, although many attempts were made to create deliberate human-made firestorms during World War II, few attempts succeeded:

According to physicist David Hafemeister, firestorms occurred after about 5% of all fire-bombing raids during World War II (but he does not explain if this is a percentage based on both Allied and Axis raids, or combined Allied raids, or U.S. raids alone). In 2005, the American National Fire Protection Association stated in a report that three &quot;major&quot; firestorms resulted from Allied conventional bombing campaigns during World War II: Hamburg, Dresden, and Tokyo. They do not include the comparatively minor firestorms at Kassel, Darmstadt or even Ube into their &quot;major&quot; firestorm category. Despite later quoting and corroborating Glasstone and Dolan and data collected from these smaller firestorms:
===21st-century cities in comparison to World War II cities===

Unlike the highly combustible World War II cities that firestormed from conventional and nuclear weapons, a FEMA report suggests that due to the nature of modern U.S. city design and construction, a firestorm is unlikely to occur even after a nuclear detonation because highrise buildings do not lend themselves to the formation of firestorms because of the baffle effect of the structures, and firestorms are unlikely in areas whose modern buildings have totally collapsed, with the exceptions of Tokyo and Hiroshima, because of the nature of their densely-packed &quot;flimsy&quot; wooden buildings in World War II.

There is also a sizable difference between the fuel loading of World War II cities that firestormed and that of modern cities, where the quantity of combustibles per square meter in the fire area in the latter is below the necessary requirement for a firestorm to form (40 kg/m2). Therefore, firestorms are not to be expected in modern North American cities after a nuclear detonation, and are expected to be unlikely in modern European cities.

Similarly, one reason for the lack of success in creating a true firestorm in the bombing of Berlin in World War II was that the building density in Berlin was too low to support easy fire spread from building to building. Another reason was that much of the building construction was newer and better than in most of the old German city centers. Modern building practices in the Berlin of World War II led to more effective firewalls and fire-resistant construction. Mass firestorms never proved to be possible in Berlin. No matter how heavy the raid or what kinds of firebombs were dropped, no true firestorm ever developed.

==Nuclear weapons in comparison to conventional weapons==
The incendiary effects of a nuclear explosion do not present any especially characteristic features. In principle, the same overall result with respect to destruction of life and property can be achieved by the use of conventional incendiary and high-explosive bombs. It has been estimated, for example, that the same fire ferocity and damage produced at Hiroshima by one 16-kiloton nuclear bomb from a single B-29 could have instead been produced by about 1,200 tons/1.2 kilotons of incendiary bombs from 220 B-29s distributed over the city; for Nagasaki, a single 21 kiloton nuclear bomb dropped on the city could have been estimated to be caused by 1,200 tons of incendiary bombs from 125 B-29s.

It may seem counterintuitive that the same amount of fire damage caused by a nuclear weapon could have instead been produced by a smaller total yield of thousands of incendiary bombs; however, World War II experience supports this assertion. For example, although not a perfect clone of the city of Hiroshima in 1945, in the conventional bombing of Dresden, the combined Royal Air Force (RAF) and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped a total of 3441.3 tons (approximately 3.4 kilotons) of ordnance (about half of which was incendiary bombs) on the night of 13–14 February 1945, and this resulted in &quot;more than&quot; of the city being destroyed by fire and firestorm effects according to one authoritative source, or approximately by another. 

In total about 4.5 kilotons of conventional ordnance was dropped on the city over a number of months during 1945 and this resulted in approximately of the city being destroyed by blast and fire effects. During the &quot;Operation MeetingHouse&quot; firebombing of Tokyo on 9–10 March 1945, 279 of the 334 B-29s dropped 1,665 tons of incendiary and high-explosive bombs on the city, resulting in the destruction of over 10,000 acres of buildings—, a quarter of the city. 

In contrast to these raids, when a single 16-kiloton nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, of the city was destroyed by blast, fire, and firestorm effects. Similarly, Major Cortez F. Enloe, a surgeon in the USAAF who worked with the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS), said that the 21-kiloton nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki did not do as much fire damage as the extended conventional airstrikes on Hamburg.

American historian Gabriel Kolko also echoed this sentiment:

This break from the linear expectation of more fire damage to occur after greater explosive yield is dropped can be easily explained by two major factors. First, the order of blast and thermal events during a nuclear explosion is not ideal for the creation of fires. In an incendiary bombing raid, incendiary weapons followed after high-explosive blast weapons were dropped, in a manner designed to create the greatest probability of fires from a limited quantity of explosive and incendiary weapons. The so-called two-ton &quot;cookies&quot;, also known as &quot;blockbusters&quot;, were dropped first and were intended to rupture water mains, as well as to blow off roofs, doors, and windows, creating an air flow that would feed the fires caused by the incendiaries that would then follow and be dropped, ideally, into holes created by the prior blast weapons, such as into attic and roof spaces. 

On the other hand, nuclear weapons produce effects that are in the reverse order, with thermal effects and &quot;flash&quot; occurring first, which are then followed by the slower blast wave. It is for this reason that conventional incendiary bombing raids are considered to be a great deal more efficient at causing mass fires than nuclear weapons of comparable yield. It is likely this led the nuclear weapon effects experts Franklin D&#x27;Olier, Samuel Glasstone and Philip J. Dolan to state that the same fire damage suffered at Hiroshima could have instead been produced by about 1 kiloton/1,000 tons of incendiary bombs.

The second factor explaining the non-intuitive break in the expected results of greater explosive yield producing greater city fire damage is that city fire damage is largely dependent not on the yield of the weapons used, but on the conditions in and around the city itself, with the fuel loading per square meter value of the city being one of the major factors. A few hundred strategically placed incendiary devices would be sufficient to start a firestorm in a city if the conditions for a firestorm, namely high fuel loading, are already inherent to the city (see Bat bomb). 

The Great Fire of London in 1666, although not forming a firestorm due to the single point of ignition, serves as an example that, given a densely packed and predominantly wooden and thatch building construction in the urban area, a mass fire is conceivable from the mere incendiary power of no more than a domestic fireplace. On the other hand, the largest nuclear weapon conceivable (more than a gigaton blast yield) will be incapable of igniting a city into a firestorm if the city&#x27;s properties, namely its fuel density, are not conducive to one developing. It&#x27;s worth remembering that such a device would still destroy any city in the world today from its shockwave alone, as well as irradiate the ruins to the point of uninhabitability. A device so large could even vaporize the city (and the crust beneath) all at once without such damage qualifying as a &quot;firestorm&quot;. 

Despite the disadvantage of nuclear weapons when compared to conventional weapons of lower or comparable yield in terms of effectiveness at starting fires, for the reasons discussed above, one undeniable advantage of nuclear weapons over conventional weapons when it comes to creating fires is that nuclear weapons undoubtedly produce all their thermal and explosive effects in a very short period of time. That is, to use Arthur Harris&#x27;s terminology, they are the epitome of an air raid guaranteed to be concentrated in &quot;point in time&quot;. 

In contrast, early in World War II, the ability to achieve conventional air raids concentrated in &quot;point of time&quot; depended largely upon the skill of pilots to remain in formation, and their ability to hit the target whilst at times also being under heavy fire from anti-aircraft fire from the cities below. Nuclear weapons largely remove these uncertain variables. Therefore, nuclear weapons reduce the question of whether a city will firestorm or not to a smaller number of variables, to the point of becoming entirely reliant on the intrinsic properties of the city, such as fuel loading, and predictable atmospheric conditions, such as wind speed, in and around the city, and less reliant on the unpredictable possibility of hundreds of bomber crews acting together successfully as a single unit.

<doc id="289430" wikidata="Q1332342" url="?curid=289430" title="Elliott wave principle">
<text>The Elliott wave principle, or Elliott wave theory, is a form of technical analysis that helps financial traders analyze market cycles and forecast market trends by identifying extremes in investor psychology and price levels, such as highs and lows, by looking for patterns in prices. Ralph Nelson Elliott (1871–1948), an American accountant, developed a model for the underlying social principles of financial markets by studying their price movements, and developed a set of analytical tools in the 1930s. He proposed that market prices unfold in specific patterns, which practitioners today call &quot;Elliott waves&quot;, or simply &quot;waves&quot;. Elliott published his theory of market behavior in the book &quot;The Wave Principle&quot; in 1938, summarized it in a series of articles in &quot;Financial World&quot; magazine in 1939, and covered it most comprehensively in his final major work &quot;Nature&#x27;s Laws: The Secret of the Universe&quot; in 1946. Elliott stated that &quot;because man is subject to rhythmical procedure, calculations having to do with his activities can be projected far into the future with a justification and certainty heretofore unattainable&quot;.

==Foundation==
The Elliott wave principle posits that collective trader psychology, a form of crowd psychology, moves between optimism and pessimism in repeating sequences of intensity and duration. These mood swings create patterns in the price movements of markets at every degree of trend or time scale.
According to Elliott&#x27;s theory, markets move through two phases: a motive (&quot;impulsive&quot;) phase, where prices move in the direction of the main trend, and a corrective phase, where prices move against the trend, as the illustration shows. Impulses are always subdivided into a set of five lower-degree waves, alternating again between motive and corrective character, so that waves &quot;1&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, and &quot;5&quot; are impulses, and waves &quot;2&quot; and &quot;4&quot; are smaller retraces of waves &quot;1&quot; and &quot;3&quot; respectively. Corrective waves subdivide into three smaller-degree waves starting with a five-wave counter-trend impulse, a retrace, and another impulse. In a bear market the dominant trend is downward, and the pattern is reversed—five waves down and three up. Motive waves always move with the trend, while corrective waves move against it.

==Wave degree==
The Elliott wave principle explains that market movements form recurring patterns of five-wave and three-wave structures, which repeat across various timeframes and exhibit fractal-like behavior. Each level of such timescales is called the degree of the wave, or price pattern. Each degree of waves consists of one full cycle of motive and corrective waves. Waves &quot;1&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, and &quot;5&quot; of each cycle are motive in character, while waves &quot;2&quot; and &quot;4&quot; are corrective. The majority of motive waves assure forward progress in the direction of the prevailing trend, in bull or bear markets, but yielding an overall principle of growth of a market.

The overall movement of a wave one degree higher is upward in a bullish trend. After the initial five waves forward and three waves of correction, the sequence is repeated on a larger degree and the self-similar fractal geometry continues to unfold. The completed motive pattern comprises 89 waves, followed by a completed corrective pattern of 55 waves.

Each degree of a pattern in a financial market has a name. Practitioners use symbols for each wave to indicate both function and degree. Numbers are used for motive waves, and letters for corrective waves (shown in the highest of the three idealized series of wave structures or degrees). Degrees are not strictly defined by absolute size or duration, but by form. Waves of the same degree may be of very different size or duration.

While exact time spans may vary, the customary order of degrees is reflected in the following sequence:
* Grand supercycle: multi-century
* Supercycle: multi-decade (about 40–70 years)
* Cycle: one year to several years, or even several decades under an Elliott extension
* Primary: a few months to two years
* Intermediate: weeks to months
* Minor: weeks
* Minute: days
* Minuette: hours
* Subminuette: minutes
Some analysts specify additional smaller and larger degrees.

==Wave personality and characteristics==
Elliott wave analysts (or &quot;Elliotticians&quot;) hold that each individual wave has its own &quot;signature&quot; or characteristic, which typically reflects the psychology of the moment. Understanding those personalities is key to the application of the wave principle; they are defined below. (Definitions assume a bull market in equities; the characteristics apply in reverse in bear markets.)

==Pattern recognition and fractals==
Elliott&#x27;s theory relies on analyzing price charts to identify wave patterns, which are fractal in nature, meaning they repeat across different timeframes, and discern what prices may do next; thus the application of the Wave Principle is a form of pattern recognition.

The structures Elliott described meet the common definition of a fractal (self-similar patterns appearing at every degree of trend). Elliott wave practitioners argue that just as naturally occurring fractals often expand and grow more complex over time, the model shows that collective human psychology develops in natural patterns, via buying and selling decisions reflected in market prices: &quot;It&#x27;s as though we are somehow programmed by mathematics. Seashell, galaxy, snowflake or human: we&#x27;re all bound by the same order.&quot; Critics, however, argue it is a form of pareidolia.

==Wave rules and guidelines==
A correct Elliott wave count must observe three rules:
*Wave 2 never retraces more than 100% of wave 1.
*Wave 3 cannot be the shortest of the three impulse waves, namely waves 1, 3 and 5.
*Wave 4 never enters the price territory of wave 1
A common guideline called &quot;alternation&quot; observes that in a five-wave pattern, waves 2 and 4 often take alternate forms; a simple sharp move in wave 2, for example, suggests a complex mild move in wave 4. Alternation can occur in impulsive and corrective waves. Elliott observed that alternate waves of the same degree must be distinctive and unique in price, time, severity, and construction. 
All formations can guide influences on market action. The time period covered by each formation, however, is the major deciding factor in the full manifestation of the Rule of Alternation. A sharp counter-trend correction in wave 2 covers a short distance in horizontal units. This should produce a sideways counter-trend correction in wave 4, covering a longer distance in horizontal units, and vice versa. Alternation provides analysts a notice of what not to expect when analyzing wave formations.

Corrective wave patterns unfold in forms known as zigzags, flats, or triangles. In turn these corrective patterns can come together to form more complex corrections. Similarly, a triangular corrective pattern is formed usually in wave 4, but very rarely in wave 2, and is the indication of the end of a correction.

==Fibonacci relationships==
R. N. Elliott&#x27;s analysis of the mathematical properties of waves and patterns eventually led him to conclude that &quot;The Fibonacci Summation Series is the basis of The Wave Principle&quot;. Numbers from the Fibonacci sequence surface repeatedly in Elliott wave structures, including motive waves (1, 3, 5), a single full cycle (8 waves), and the completed motive (89 waves) and corrective (55 waves) patterns. Elliott developed his market model before he realized that it reflects the Fibonacci sequence. &quot;When I discovered The Wave Principle action of market trends, I had never heard of either the Fibonacci Series or the Pythagorean Diagram&quot;.

The Fibonacci sequence is also closely connected to the Golden ratio (1.618). Practitioners commonly use this ratio and related ratios to establish support and resistance levels for market waves, namely the price points which help define the parameters of a trend. See Fibonacci retracement.

Finance professor Roy Batchelor and researcher Richard Ramyar, a former director of the United Kingdom Society of Technical Analysts and formerly Global Head of Research at Lipper and Thomson Reuters Wealth Management, studied whether Fibonacci ratios appear non-randomly in the stock market, as Elliott&#x27;s model predicts. The researchers said the &quot;idea that prices retrace to a Fibonacci ratio or round fraction of the previous trend clearly lacks any scientific rationale&quot;. They also said &quot;there is no significant difference between the frequencies with which price and time ratios occur in cycles in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and frequencies which we would expect to occur at random in such a time series&quot;.

==After Elliott==
Following Elliott&#x27;s death in 1948, other market technicians and financial professionals continued to use the wave principle and provide forecasts to investors. Charles Collins, who had published Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Wave Principle&quot; and helped introduce Elliott&#x27;s theory to Wall Street, stated that Elliott&#x27;s contributions to technical analysis were as significant as those of Charles Dow.

Hamilton Bolton, founder of The Bank Credit Analyst, espoused wave analysis to a wide readership in the 1950s and 1960s in his annual market commentaries and forecasts. 

Bolton introduced the wave principle to A. J. Frost (1908–1999), who provided weekly financial commentary on the Financial News Network in the 1980s. Over the course of his lifetime Frost&#x27;s contributions to the field were of great significance and today the Canadian Society of Technical Analysts awards the A. J. Frost Memorial Award to someone each year who has also made a significant contribution to the field of technical analysis.

Additional notable discoveries of new rules and new wave patterns were discovered after Ralph Nelson Elliott published his original work. Glenn Neely, who published &quot;Elliott Waves in Motion&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Mastering Elliott Wave&quot; in 1990, used Elliott wave theory to present the first scientific and objective approach to market forecasting. Around 1980, Neely devoted his career to Elliott wave research and a couple years later, applied what he learned by teaching the application of Elliott wave principle in real-time market analysis. Over time, Neely&#x27;s teaching method evolved to include his own wave theory called Neowave (which is an extension of Elliott wave). The additional Neowave theory and rules help correct the contradictions created in Elliott wave theory which consists of different rules defining simple impulse patterns of the stock market waves. Under Neowave theory, the major new wave patterns discovered are: neutral triangle, diametric formation, symmetrical formation, extracting triangle, 3rd-extension terminal with 5th failure, and reverse alternation.

==Adoption and use==
Robert Prechter found Elliott&#x27;s work while employed as a market technician at Merrill Lynch in the 1970s. His self-published market newsletter prominently featured his Elliott wave analysis during the bull market of the 1980s and giving his views exposure among followers of technical analysis.

==Criticism==
Benoit Mandelbrot, who developed mathematical models of market pricing based on fractal geometry, expressed caution about the validity of wave models:
Critics warn that the wave principle is too vague to be useful, since practitioners cannot consistently identify the beginning or end of waves, resulting in forecasts prone to subjective revisions. Technical analyst David Aronson wrote:
Some analysts consider the Elliott wave principle as too dated to be applicable in today&#x27;s markets, as explained by financial market analyst Glenn Neely, author of &quot;Mastering Elliott Wave&quot;:

<doc id="289434" wikidata="Q691007" url="?curid=289434" title="Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum">
<text>The Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL) is a comprehensive collection of ancient Latin inscriptions. It forms an authoritative source for documenting the surviving epigraphy of classical antiquity. Public and personal inscriptions throw light on all aspects of Roman life and history. The &quot;Corpus&quot; continues to be updated in new editions and supplements.

CIL also refers to the organization within the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities responsible for collecting data on and publishing the Latin inscriptions. It was founded in 1853 by Theodor Mommsen and is the first and major organization aiming at a comprehensive survey.

==Aim==
The &quot;CIL&quot; collects all Latin inscriptions from the whole territory of the Roman Empire, ordering them geographically and systematically. The earlier volumes collected and published authoritative versions of all inscriptions known at the time—most of these had been previously published in a wide range of publications. The descriptions include images of the original inscription if available, drawings showing the letters in their original size and position, and an interpretation reconstructing abbreviations and missing words, along with discussion of issues and problems. The language of the &quot;CIL&quot; is Latin.

==Beginnings==
In 1847 a committee was created in Berlin with the aim of publishing an organized collection of Latin inscriptions, which had previously been described piecemeal by hundreds of scholars over the preceding centuries. The leading figure of this committee was Theodor Mommsen (who wrote several of the volumes covering Italy). Much of the work involved personal inspections of sites and monuments in an attempt to replicate the original as much as possible. In those cases where a previously cited inscription could no longer be found, the authors tried to get an accurate reading by comparing the versions of the published inscription in the works of previous authors who had seen the original. The first volume appeared in 1863.

==Current status==
The &quot;CIL&quot; presently consists of 17 volumes in about 70 parts, recording approximately 180,000 inscriptions. Thirteen supplementary volumes have plates and special indices. The first volume, in two sections, covered the oldest inscriptions, to the end of the Roman Republic; volumes II to XIV are divided geographically, according to the regions where the inscriptions were found. The other volumes cover other topics. Volume XVII, for instance, is entirely devoted to milestones. A volume XVIII is planned, which will contain the &quot;Carmina Latina Epigraphica&quot; (Latin verse inscriptions). A two-volume &quot;Index of Numbers&quot;, correlating inscription numbers with volume numbers, was published in 2003.

The Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (BBAW) continues to update and reprint the &quot;CIL.&quot;

<text>Malus ( or ) is a genus of about 32–57 species of small deciduous trees or shrubs in the family Rosaceae, including the domesticated orchard apple, crab apples (sometimes known in North America as crabapples) and wild apples.

The genus is native to the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere.

==Description==

Apple trees are typically tall at maturity, with a dense, twiggy crown. The leaves are long, alternate, simple, with a serrated margin. The flowers are borne in corymbs, and have five petals, which may be white, pink, or red, and are perfect, with usually red stamens that produce copious pollen, and a half-inferior ovary; flowering occurs in the spring after 50–80 growing degree days (varying greatly according to subspecies and cultivar).

Many apples require cross-pollination between individuals by insects (typically bees, which freely visit the flowers for both nectar and pollen); these are called self-sterile, so self-pollination is impossible, making pollinating insects essential.

A number of cultivars are self-pollinating, such as &#x27;Granny Smith&#x27; and &#x27;Golden Delicious&#x27;, but are considerably fewer in number compared to their cross-pollination dependent counterparts.
Several &quot;Malus&quot; species, including domestic apples, hybridize freely.

The fruit is a globose pome, varying in size from in diameter in most of the wild species, to in &quot;M. sylvestris sieversii&quot;, in &quot;M. domestica&quot;, and even larger in certain cultivated orchard apples. The centre of the fruit contains five carpels arranged star-like, each containing one or two seeds.

== Subdivision ==
36 species and 4 hybrids are accepted. The genus &quot;Malus&quot; is subdivided into eight sections (six, with two added in 2006 and 2008). The oldest fossils of the genus date to the Eocene (Lutetian), which are leaves belonging to the species &quot;Malus collardii&quot; and &quot;Malus kingiensis&quot; from western North America (Idaho) and the Russian Far East (Kamchatka), respectively.

== Cultivation ==


Crabapples are popular as compact ornamental trees, providing blossom in spring and colourful fruit in autumn. The fruits often persist throughout winter. Numerous hybrid cultivars have been selected.

Some crabapples are used as rootstocks for domestic apples to add beneficial characteristics. For example, the rootstocks of &quot;Malus baccata&quot; varieties are used to give additional cold hardiness to the combined plants for orchards in cold northern areas.

They are also used as pollinizers in apple orchards. Varieties of crabapple are selected to bloom contemporaneously with the apple variety in an orchard planting, and the crabs are planted every sixth or seventh tree, or limbs of a crab tree are grafted onto some of the apple trees. In emergencies, a bucket or drum bouquet of crabapple flowering branches is placed near the beehives as orchard pollenizers.

Because of the plentiful blossoms and small fruit, crabapples are popular for use in bonsai culture.

===Cultivars===
These cultivars have won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
* &#x27;Adirondack&#x27;
* &#x27;Butterball&#x27;
* &#x27;Comtesse de Paris&#x27;
* &#x27;Evereste&#x27;
* &#x27;Jelly King&#x27;=&#x27;Mattfru&#x27;
* &#x27;Laura&#x27;
* &quot;Malus × robusta&quot; &#x27;Red Sentinel&#x27;
* &#x27;Sun Rival&#x27;
Other varieties are dealt with under their species names.

== Toxicity ==
The seeds contain cyanide compounds.

== Uses ==

Crabapple fruit is not an important crop in most areas, being extremely sour due to malic acid (which like the genus derives from the Latin name &quot;&quot;), and in some species woody, so is rarely eaten raw. In some Southeast Asian cultures, they are valued as a sour condiment, sometimes eaten with salt and chilli or shrimp paste.

Some crabapple varieties are an exception to the reputation of being sour, and can be very sweet, such as the &#x27;Chestnut&#x27; cultivar.

Crabapples are an excellent source of pectin. Using sugar and spices such as ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice, their juice can be made into ruby-coloured crab apple jelly with a full, spicy flavour. A small percentage of crabapples in cider makes a more interesting flavour. As Old English &quot;Wergulu&quot;, the crab apple is one of the nine plants invoked in the pagan Anglo-Saxon &quot;Nine Herbs Charm&quot;, recorded in the 10th century.

Applewood gives off a pleasant scent when burned, and smoke from an applewood fire gives an excellent flavour to smoked foods. It is easier to cut when green; dry applewood is exceedingly difficult to carve by hand. It is a good wood for cooking fires because it burns hot and slow, without producing much flame. Applewood is used to make handles of hand saws; in the early 1900s 2,000,000 board feet of applewood were used annually for this purpose.

<text>In symbolic computation, the Risch algorithm is a method of indefinite integration used in some computer algebra systems to find antiderivatives. It is named after the American mathematician Robert Henry Risch, a specialist in computer algebra who developed it in 1968.

The algorithm transforms the problem of integration into a problem in algebra. It is based on the form of the function being integrated and on methods for integrating rational functions, radicals, logarithms, and exponential functions. Risch called it a decision procedure, because it is a method for deciding whether a function has an elementary function as an indefinite integral, and if it does, for determining that indefinite integral. However, the algorithm does not always succeed in identifying whether or not the antiderivative of a given function in fact can be expressed in terms of elementary functions.

The complete description of the Risch algorithm takes over 100 pages. The Risch–Norman algorithm is a simpler, faster, but less powerful variant that was developed in 1976 by Arthur Norman.

Some significant progress has been made in computing the logarithmic part of a mixed transcendental-algebraic integral by Brian L. Miller.

==Description==
The Risch algorithm is used to integrate elementary functions. These are functions obtained by composing exponentials, logarithms, radicals, trigonometric functions, and the four arithmetic operations (). Laplace solved this problem for the case of rational functions, as he showed that the indefinite integral of a rational function is a rational function and a finite number of constant multiples of logarithms of rational functions . The algorithm suggested by Laplace is usually described in calculus textbooks; as a computer program, it was finally implemented in the 1960s.

Liouville formulated the problem that is solved by the Risch algorithm. Liouville proved by analytical means that if there is an elementary solution to the equation then there exist constants and functions and in the field generated by such that the solution is of the form

:formula_1

Risch developed a method that allows one to consider only a finite set of functions of Liouville&#x27;s form.

The intuition for the Risch algorithm comes from the behavior of the exponential and logarithm functions under differentiation. For the function , where and are differentiable functions, we have

: formula_2

so if were in the result of an indefinite integration, it should be expected to be inside the integral. Also, as

: formula_3

then if were in the result of an integration, then only a few powers of the logarithm should be expected.

==Problem examples==
Finding an elementary antiderivative is very sensitive to details. For instance, the following algebraic function (posted to sci.math.symbolic by Henri Cohen in 1993) has an elementary antiderivative, as Wolfram Mathematica since version 13 shows (however, Mathematica does not use the Risch algorithm to compute this integral):

: formula_4

namely:

: formula_5

But if the constant term 71 is changed to 72, it is not possible to represent the antiderivative in terms of elementary functions, as FriCAS also shows. Some computer algebra systems may here return an antiderivative in terms of &quot;non-elementary&quot; functions (i.e. elliptic integrals), which are outside the scope of the Risch algorithm. For example, Mathematica returns a result with the functions EllipticPi and EllipticF. Integrals in the form formula_6 were solved by Chebyshev (and in what cases it is elementary), but the strict proof for it was ultimately done by Zolotarev.

The following is a more complex example that involves both algebraic and transcendental functions:

: formula_7

In fact, the antiderivative of this function has a fairly short form that can be found using substitution formula_8 (SymPy can solve it while FriCAS fails with &quot;implementation incomplete (constant residues)&quot; error in Risch algorithm):

: formula_9
Some Davenport &quot;theorems&quot; are still being clarified. For example in 2020 a counterexample to such a &quot;theorem&quot; was found, where it turns out that an elementary antiderivative exists after all.

==Implementation==
Transforming Risch&#x27;s theoretical algorithm into an algorithm that can be effectively executed by a computer was a complex task which took a long time.

The case of the purely transcendental functions (which do not involve roots of polynomials) is relatively easy and was implemented early in most computer algebra systems. The first implementation was done by Joel Moses in Macsyma soon after the publication of Risch&#x27;s paper.

The case of purely algebraic functions was partially solved and implemented in Reduce by James H. Davenport – for simplicity it could only deal with square roots and repeated square roots and not general radicals or other non-quadratic algebraic relations between variables.

The general case was solved and almost fully implemented in Scratchpad, a precursor of Axiom, by Manuel Bronstein, there is Axiom&#x27;s fork FriCAS, with active Risch and other algorithm development on github. However, the implementation did not include some of the branches for special cases completely. Currently in 2025, there is no known full implementation of the Risch algorithm.

==Decidability==
The Risch algorithm applied to general elementary functions is not an algorithm but a semi-algorithm because it needs to check, as a part of its operation, if certain expressions are equivalent to zero (constant problem), in particular in the constant field. For expressions that involve only functions commonly taken to be elementary it is not known whether an algorithm performing such a check exists (current computer algebra systems use heuristics); moreover, if one adds the absolute value function to the list of elementary functions, then it is known that no such algorithm exists; see Richardson&#x27;s theorem.

This issue also arises in the polynomial division algorithm; this algorithm will fail if it cannot correctly determine whether coefficients vanish identically. Virtually every non-trivial algorithm relating to polynomials uses the polynomial division algorithm, the Risch algorithm included. If the constant field is computable, i.e., for elements not dependent on , then the problem of zero-equivalence is decidable, so the Risch algorithm is a complete algorithm. Examples of computable constant fields are and , i.e., rational numbers and rational functions in with rational-number coefficients, respectively, where is an indeterminate that does not depend on .

This is also an issue in the Gaussian elimination matrix algorithm (or any algorithm that can compute the nullspace of a matrix), which is also necessary for many parts of the Risch algorithm. Gaussian elimination will produce incorrect results if it cannot correctly determine whether a pivot is identically zero.

<text>Samnium () is a Latin exonym for a region of Southern Italy anciently inhabited by the Samnites. Their own endonyms were &quot;Safinim&quot; for the country (attested in one inscription and one coin legend) and &quot;Safineis&quot; for the The language of these endonyms and of the population was the Oscan language. However, not all the Samnites spoke Oscan, and not all the Oscan-speakers lived in Samnium.

Ancient geographers were unable to relay a precise definition of Samnium&#x27;s borders. Moreover, the areas it included vary depending on the time period considered. The main configurations are the borders it had during the &quot;floruit&quot; of the Oscan speakers, from about 600 BC to about 290 BC, when it was finally absorbed by the Roman Republic.

The original territory of Samnium should not be confused with the later territory of the same name. Rome&#x27;s first Emperor, Augustus, divided Italy into 11 regions. Although these entities only served administrative purposes, and were identified with the sole numeral, by scholarly convention the &quot;Regio IV&quot; has been dubbed &quot;&quot;Samnium&quot;. Ancient Samnium had actually been divided into three of the Augustan regions.

==Etymology==
Etymologically the name Samnium is generally recognized to be a form of the name of the Sabines, who were Umbrians. From Safinim, Sabinus, Sabellus and Samnis an Indo-European root can be extracted, *-, which becomes Sab- in Latino-Faliscan and Saf- in Osco-Umbrian: Sabini and *Safineis. The eponymous god of the Sabines, Sabus, seems to support this view. The Greek terms, Saunitai and Saunitis, remain outside the group. Nothing is known of their origin.

At some point in prehistory, a population speaking a common language extended over both Samnium and Umbria. Salmon conjectures that it was common Italic and puts forward a date of 600 BC, after which the common language began to separate into dialects. This date does not necessarily correspond to any historical or archaeological evidence; developing a synthetic view of the ethnology of proto-historic Italy is an incomplete and ongoing task.

The linguist Julius Pokorny carries the etymology somewhat further back. Conjecturing that the -a- was altered from an -o- during some prehistoric residence in Illyria he derives the names from an o-grade extension *swo-bho- of an extended e-grade *swe-bho- of the possessive adjective, *s(e)we-, of the reflexive pronoun, *se-, &quot;oneself&quot; (the source of English self). The result is a set of Indo-European tribal names (if not the endonym of the Indo-Europeans): Germanic Suebi and Semnones, Suiones; Celtic Senones; Slavic Serbs and Sorbs; Italic Sabelli, Sabini, etc., as well as a large number of kinship terms. The general concept is &quot;our own kith and kin&quot;, Pokorny&#x27;s (&quot;of our own kind&quot;), (&quot;the totality of our own people&quot;), (&quot;love&quot;), (&quot;clan comrades&quot;), (&quot;clan members&quot;), and the like.

==Historical geography==

Samnium mostly lay on the Apennine area; it was delimited by Latium to the north, by Lucania to the south, by Campania to the west, and by Apulia to the east. The principal cities of the region were &quot;Bovaiamom&quot;, renamed &quot;Bovianum&quot; by Latins (today: Bojano or Boiano) and &quot;Maleventum&quot; (&quot;Maloenton&quot; in Oscan), which was later renamed &quot;Beneventum&quot; by the Romans (today: Benevento). For most of their history the Samnites were landlocked, but during a brief period they controlled parts of both coasts of the Italian peninsula.

The Samnites were composed of at least four tribes: the Pentri (capital: &quot;Bovianum&quot;), the Caraceni (principal cities: &quot;Cluviae&quot;, the modern Casoli, and &quot;Juvanum&quot;, the ruins of which are spread between Torricella Peligna and Montenerodomo), the Caudini (capital: &quot;Caudium&quot;, today Montesarchio) and the Hirpini (main cities: &quot;Beneventum&quot;, &quot;Abellinum&quot;, &quot;Aquilonia&quot;). They may have later been joined by the Frentani (capital &quot;Larinum&quot;, the modern Larino).

==History==
The earliest written record of the people is a treaty with the Romans from 354 BC, which set their border at the Liris River. Shortly thereafter the Samnite Wars broke out; they won an important battle against the Roman army in 321 BC, and their &quot;imperium&quot; reached its peak in 316 BC after further gains from the Romans. By 290 BC, the Romans were able to break the Samnites&#x27; power after some hard-fought battles. The Samnites were one of the Italian peoples that allied with King Pyrrhus of Epirus during the Pyrrhic War. After Pyrrhus left for Sicily, the Romans invaded Samnium and were crushed at the Battle of the Cranita hills, but after the defeat of Pyrrhus, the Samnites could not resist on their own and surrendered to Rome. Some of the Samnites joined and aided Hannibal during the Second Punic War, but most stayed loyal. The Samnites and several other Italic people rebelled against Rome and started the Social War (91–87 BC), after Romans refused to grant them Roman Citizenship. The war lasted almost three years, and resulted in a Roman victory. However, Samnites and other Italic tribes were granted Roman citizenship, to avoid another war. The Samnites supported the Populares in the civil war against Lucius Cornelius Sulla, but unfortunately for them, Sulla ended up winning the war and was declared the dictator of Rome. Sulla ordered all those who went against him to be punished. Thousands of people in Rome and all over Italy were brutally hunted down and killed. Samnites, who were one of the most prominent supporters of the Populares, were punished so severely that it was recorded &quot;some of their cities have now dwindled into villages, some indeed being entirely deserted.&quot; Samnites did not play any prominent role in history after this, and they eventually became Latinized and assimilated into the Roman World

<text>Wolfgang Schüssel (; born 7 June 1945) is a retired Austrian politician. He was Chancellor of Austria for two consecutive terms from February 2000 to January 2007. While being recognised as a rare example of an active reformer in contemporary Austrian politics, his governments were also highly controversial from the beginning, starting with the fact that he formed a coalition government with Jörg Haider&#x27;s Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) on both occasions. In 2011, he retired from being an active member of parliament due to a multitude of charges of corruption against members of his governments.

== Early life, education, and start in politics ==

Born in Vienna, Schüssel attended that city&#x27;s &quot;Schottengymnasium&quot;, a well known Roman Catholic &quot;gymnasium&quot; for boys, where he took his &quot;Matura&quot; exams in 1963. He went on to study at the University of Vienna, receiving a doctorate in law in 1968.

Schüssel was secretary of the parliamentary group of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party from 1968 to 1975. From 1975 to 1991, he was secretary general of the Austrian Business Federation, a sub-organization of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party.

== Minister in the &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; ==
He became Minister for Economic Affairs on 24 April 1989 in a coalition government under Chancellor Franz Vranitzky (SPÖ) formed by the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP).

On 22 April 1995, at the 30th Party Congress of the ÖVP, Schüssel staged a leadership coup and ousted Erhard Busek as chairman of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party. He also replaced the party&#x27;s ministers in the governing coalition.

On 4 May 1995, Schüssel replaced Busek as vice-chancellor in Franz Vranitzky&#x27;s fourth government, and also took over as Minister for Foreign Affairs. He held the same posts in Chancellor Vranitzky&#x27;s fifth Cabinet, as well as the first cabinet of Chancellor Viktor Klima&#x27;s (SPÖ).

== Chancellor of Austria ==

=== The Schüssel I government ===
In the 1999 election, Schüssel&#x27;s ÖVP finished third, trailing Jörg Haider&#x27;s Freedom Party (FPÖ) by 415 votes. After a series of talks to renew the grand coalition with the SPÖ failed, Schüssel sought a coalition with the Freedom Party.

Jörg Haider, as leader of the larger party, would typically have been the presumptive chancellor, with Schüssel remaining vice chancellor. However, it was apparent that Haider was too controversial to serve in the government, let alone lead it. The FPÖ thus agreed to support Schüssel as chancellor, and Haider did not join the cabinet. Schüssel was sworn in on 4 February 2000, with Haider&#x27;s successor as FPÖ leader, Susanne Riess-Passer, as vice chancellor. His government was the first in 30 years not to be led by the SPÖ.

Schüssel&#x27;s government was immediately highly controversial due to the inclusion of the Freedom Party. Schüssel was perceived as having breached the long-standing &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; against right-wing populist parties in Europe. This and the association of Haider with the government sparked widespread criticism both domestically and internationally. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that, during the decisive days of Schüssel&#x27;s negotiations, caretaker Chancellor Viktor Klima had &quot;urged fellow EU leaders to help influence the coalition bargaining.&quot;

The ÖVP had been a member of every government from 1945 to 1970 and from 1986 onwards, but even in opposition had never been completely excluded from power. The post-war tradition of consensus-building meant that representatives of all major interest groups in the country were to be consulted before any policy was enacted. Schüssel, however, broke with that tradition in order to rapidly implement the reforms he felt necessary. This was received poorly by many Austrians, who considered the consensus-building approach to be an unwritten part of the constitution. Between 2000 and 2002, there were weekly protests throughout Vienna against the government, dubbed the &quot;Donnerstagsdemonstrationen&quot; (Thursday demonstrations).

==== The &quot;EU Sanctions&quot; ====
The Schüssel government was received poorly by governments internationally, including those of the fourteen other European Union member states, due to its cooperation with the FPÖ. An initiative was organised, with encouragement from much of the Austrian left-wing, to express international disapproval. Because nothing in the legal framework of the European Union enabled official action to be taken, informal &quot;sanctions&quot; were imposedfor several months, many other national leaders engaged in social and diplomatic ostracism of the Schüssel government, refusing any unnecessary interaction. Participants included French president Jacques Chirac, German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, and leading Belgian politicians. Government supporters frequently blamed the SPÖ and President Thomas Klestil for this campaign, accusing them of disloyalty to Austria.

After several months without any change in the situation, a delegation of high-ranking EU diplomatsMartti Ahtisaari, Marcelino Oreja and Jochen Froweinwas sent to Austria to examine the political situation and determine whether the so-called &quot;sanctions&quot; could be lifted. Their report did not find conditions that would permit EU members to institute any official measures under EU law, but did present proposals for how EU law could be modified to resolve such a situation in the future. These proposals were incorporated in the Treaty of Nice, ratified in 2001. Following the report, EU leaders quietly &quot;lifted&quot; the sanctions and returned to normality during the summer of 2000, despite the situation in Austria remaining unchanged.

=== The Schüssel II government === 

By the summer of 2002, a series of setbacks in local and regional elections had resulted in considerable internal strife in the FPÖ. When the leading figures of the more pragmatic wing of the party, Vice-Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer and Finance Minister Karl-Heinz Grasser, announced their resignations, Schüssel called early elections. The ÖVP recorded its best result since 1983, winning 42.3% of votes cast and overtaking the SPÖ for the first time since 1966. After negotiating with both the SPÖ and The Greens, Schüssel decided to renew the coalition with the FPÖ, which had won just 10% of votes. On 28 February 2003 Schüssel was sworn in as Chancellor for a second time.

In April 2005, the FPÖ effectively split into two parties. The bulk of the party, including Haider, the FPÖ cabinet ministers, and most of the FPÖ parliamentary caucus, formed the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), while most party members and state branches remained with the old party. Despite this change, Schüssel continued the coalition, which served out the remainder of the legislative term.

In the 2006 legislative election, the ÖVP lost many of the voters it had won over in 2002, and fell back to second place against the SPÖ. In addition, the BZÖ won just 7 seats, leaving the outgoing government well short of a majority. While a three-party coalition with both the FPÖ and BZÖ would reach a slim majority, Schüssel stated after the election that a coalition with either party &quot;would not be reasonable&quot;. The SPÖ and ÖVP began the process of negotiating a grand coalition. Schüssel served as caretaker Chancellor until the new government was sworn in on 11 January 2007; he also served briefly as acting Minister of the Interior following the death of Liese Prokop on 31 December 2006.

===President of the European Council, 2006===
Austria succeeded the United Kingdom as holder of the Presidency of the European Council on 1 January 2006. In the presence of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Schüssel promised to lead the European Union &quot;hand in hand&quot; with Germany, and Merkel promised that Germany would do everything to &quot;help&quot; Austria during its presidency and make it a success. Schüssel also stated that Austria needed &quot;some friends of the presidency&quot;. This led to Brussels diplomats describing the Austrian presidency as &quot;the small German presidency&quot;, according to French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot;.

==Chairman of the ÖVP Parliamentary Group, 2006–2008==
Following the 2006 election, Schüssel became chairman of the ÖVP Parliamentary Group. He announced after the September 2008 election that he would continue to sit in parliament only as a backbencher; Josef Pröll was to replace him as chairman of the ÖVP Parliamentary Group. In addition to his parliamentary work, Schüssel served on the Commission of Eminent Persons on The Role of the IAEA to 2020 and Beyond, chaired by Ernesto Zedillo, whose report &quot;Reinforcing the Global Nuclear Order for Peace and Prosperity&quot; was launched in June 2008.

In 2011, Schüssel retired from parliament due to massive charges of corruption against members of the governments led by him originating from the Telekom Austria Affair.

== Policies ==

The government&#x27;s attempts at achieving a balanced budget (called &quot;Nulldefizit&quot;)while being more successful than most of its contemporary initiatives abroadfailed. Changes involved a mixture of raising taxes and fees on the one hand and cost-cutting measures on the other which proved highly visible and prompted significant criticism. For example, the Austrian education system suffered considerably, shown by the PISA study released in 2004: many salaries and expensive projects were cut at universities, even though the government proclaimed it would bring teaching and research to a &quot;world-class&quot; level. Cost-cutting in the security sector was blamed for an increase in crime.

At the same time, Schüssel&#x27;s government increased public spending in certain areas. For example, the new &quot;Kindergeld&quot; (child benefit) to help families replaced the old &quot;Karenzgeld&quot;, which was dependent on the recipient standing in employment. This change was a nod to the Freedom Party, which had campaigned for this measure.

The decision to replace the old Draken fighter planes of the Bundesheer with 18 Eurofighters
(originally 24 were ordered, this number was reduced after the 2002 floods) was seen as waste of money by the opposition, most of all because of the attempts to save money in almost every area of the public administration. The government&#x27;s arguments for this was that the Austrian State Treaty, according to which Austria needs to be able to defend herself, is to be read to imply that Austria must be in complete control of her air space. The opposition argued that this goal could have been reached in a much cheaper way.

Starting from around 2030, the unfavorable structure of the population pyramid had been forecast create a ratio of active to retired workers of 1:1. Schüssel&#x27;s pension reform made provision for this in the reduction of future pensions and raising of the retirement age. Schüssel&#x27;s reform of the Austrian pension system is more broad-sweeping and thus more likely to be effective than all previous reforms in this area combined. Demographics experts insisted that it ideally should have gone further, whereas the SPÖ and the Austrian Federation of Trade Unions (ÖGB) protested heavily and argued that the pension losses, limited by Schüssel to 10% and later reduced to 5%, were excessive. Such measures laid the groundwork for later military reform and pension reform. Mandatory military service to reduce to six months or even its abolition. From 2005 onwards, corporate tax was cut to 25% to stimulate investment and economic growth. This was an example of harmonization toward neighbouring taxes as recent EU and Schengen area member Slovakia had consistently lower tax rates. However, critics argued that such a tax advantage for firms was unfair to many sole traders.

<text>People&#x27;s Union (, , abbr. VU) was a Flemish nationalist political party in Belgium, formed in 1954 as a successor to the Christian Flemish People&#x27;s Union. 

The Volksunie defined itself as a big tent and catch-all party that combined support from the left and right with the main goal of focusing on increased Flemish autonomy and establishing more linguistic and political rights for the Flemish community. The party also based its platform on civic nationalism over radicalism in order to foster a more legitimate image. It also contained members sympathetic to federalism and full separatism, with its stance on whether to secede Flanders from Belgium or redefine Belgium as a federal nation in which Flanders had devolved power changing with its leadership. The VU participated in three coalitions with the Belgian government during its existence and has been credited by historians with successfully bringing the issue of Flemish nationalism to mainstream Belgian politics and implementing its federalist objectives. However, the party later suffered from ideological schisms which resulted in a decline in support before it was dissolved in 2001.

== Early history ==
The party was officially founded in 1954 as the successor to the Christian Flemish People&#x27;s Union (&quot;Christelijke Vlaamse Volksunie&quot;, CVV) electoral alliance, which had successfully run for election that year. It originated from the loose Flemish movement, which included different organisations seeking to promote Flanders and call for more political freedom for the Flemish community. The Flemish movement varied from wanting to secure more linguistic, cultural and political rights for Flanders within the Belgian state to wanting the total secession of Flanders from Belgium or even reunification with the Netherlands under the Greater Netherlands concept. In the second half of the nineteenth century, Flemish nationalists operated within the established political partieshey chief and initially had close ties with the political left such as the Vermeylenfonds movement. 

During the Second World War, previous Flemish nationalist groups such as the Flemish National League (&quot;Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond&quot;, VNV) collaborated with the Nazis, who had promised them increased Flemish autonomy. That initially complicated the postwar re-emergence of Flemish nationalism although only a faction of the broader movement had actually pursued an agenda of collaboration. After the only outlets for organised Flemish nationalism were charitable groups dedicated to war veterans and the dominant Christian Social Party (&quot;Christelijke Volkspartij&quot;, CVV), which was not avowedly nationalist but had a separatist wing.

As a result, the Volksunie sought to build a strong alliance of Flemish nationalists under one movement but was careful to choose its leaders from nationalist circles that had not collaborated with the Nazis. Ideologically, the Volksunie preferred to position itself around the centre and saw itself as a coalition of various shades of Flemish thought as a big tent party with the objective of pursuing further autonomy and a sense of national identity for the Flemish region. To distance itself from prewar nationalism, the VU sought to promote its brand of nationalism as civic nationalism, as opposed to nationalism based on ethnic and racial sentiments, to gain credibility and wider support. As a result, the party was initially able to bring together various strands of scattered Flemish nationalists into a coherent movement. The party was closely aligned to the Order of Flemish Militants (&quot;Vlaamse Militanten Orde&quot;, VMO) during the 1950s, with the VMO handling propaganda, recruitment and campaign work for the VU. However, the groups began to drift apart, as the VU moved to the centre while the VMO began to turn to the extreme right. The two movements formally broke ties in 1963.

The party contained members from the left, right and centre of the political spectrum from socialists to right-wing conservatives, and it differed from other Belgian parties by putting Flemish nationalism at the forefront of its image and platform as opposed to basing its policies on a right or left-of-centre identity. At a European level, the Volksunie was a member of the European Free Alliance, which contained other separatist and regionalist parties.

== Initial success ==
The party initially proved successful and had members elected to the Chamber of Representatives (five) and the Senate (two) of the Belgian Federal Parliament in 1961. The party continued to grow in stature and reached the 11.0% at the national level in 1978 elections, gaining 21 representatives and went on to participate in the Belgian government as a coalition partner. This enabled the party to become the first electorally successful Flemish nationalist party and bring the agenda of Flemish autonomy on the mainstream political stage. In government, the VU was also able to ensure a Dutch language version of the Belgian constitution was adopted, gradually secured more regional powers for Flanders and worked to redefine Belgium as a federal rather than a unitary state.

== Ideological splits and decline == 
The acceptance of federalism in place of separatism by the VU in the 1970s did not sit well with the party&#x27;s right-wing and separatist wing, and a split became inevitable, particularly after the party entered the coalition government of Leo Tindemans (CVP, Christian-Democrat). The right-wing separatist and national conservative faction broke away and organized itself in the Vlaams Blok, becoming a much stronger political force and surpassing Volksunie at the beginning of the 1990s (6.6% against VU&#x27;s 5.9% in 1991 elections).

Although the party would continue to participate in two other coalition governments, the Volksunie continued its electoral decline (5.6% in 1999 elections against the 9.9% of the Vlaams Blok), with the internal divisions between the right-wing and left-wing members re-emerging in 2001. In the beginning of the 1990s, Bert Anciaux became party president and led the party in an ever more leftist and progressive direction, combining the social-liberal ideas of his iD21-movement with the regionalist course of the People&#x27;s Union. These experiments were opposed by the more conservative leaning and separatist party base. Tension rose at the end of the 1990s when Geert Bourgeois of the centre-right nationalist wing, was elected chairman by party members, in preference to the incumbent and progressive Patrik Vankrunkelsven. Factions subsequently clashed multiple times, over the future course of the party and possible support for current state reform negotiations. On 13 October 2001 the party openly split into three factions: the progressive wing around Bert Anciaux, the conservative nationalist wing around Geert Bourgeois, and a centrist group opposing the imminent split. An internal referendum was held on the future of the party. 

The right wing won a large plurality at a party referendum, with 47 percent. However, while it inherited Volksunie&#x27;s structure, it did not take the Volksunie name due to falling short of a majority and not being allowed to use the party name under Belgian electoral law. Instead, it reconstituted itself as a new party, and re-registered itself as the New Flemish Alliance (&quot;Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie&quot;, or N-VA). The left wing under Anciaux broke off and became Spirit, while the liberal members joined the Flemish Liberals and Democrats. The two parties proceeded to form new electoral alliances, known in Belgium as cartels, with the N-VA allying with Christian Democratic and Flemish and Spirit with the Socialist Party - Different. These cartels broke up in 2008 as the parties continued their decline, until the N-VA experienced a sudden resurgence in 2009, eventually becoming the largest party in Flanders and going on to participate as a coalition partner in the Belgian government, while Spirit ceased to exist, merging with Groen.

==Ideology and legacy==
The Volksunie did not follow the traditional left-right pattern of politics and instead presented itself as a big tent movement that encompassed policy ideas from all over the political spectrum, but regarded Flemish nationalism and autonomy as its core objective above all else. The VU promoted the use of the Dutch language and recognition of Flemish cultural identity and heritage. It also successfully called for the establishment of a Flemish Parliament, more devolved decision making powers, political reform, the separation of Flemish Brabant from the former Brabant province and the St. Michael&#x27;s Agreement of 1992 which re-established Belgium as a federal country. Behind its nationalist image, the party&#x27;s underlying ideology shifted with the leadership. For example, under the leadership of Jaak Gabriëls and Geert Bourgeois, the VU took on a right-wing identity whereas under Bert Anciaux the VU was steered in a centre-left direction. Although the party&#x27;s focus on protecting Flemish interests initially attracted support, the ideological difference between the VU&#x27;s wings and the acceptance of Federalism over full Flemish independence alienated the VU&#x27;s separatist and national conservative flank who left to form &quot;Vlaams Blok,&quot; taking some of the VU&#x27;s voters with it. By the early 2000s, the party&#x27;s splits resulted in the more dominant conservative faction forming the N-VA (which adopted a position of supporting a confederal Belgian state as a means of paving the way for Flemish independence) and the centre-left faction becoming Spirit. A majority of former VU leaders and members either joined the N-VA or Spirit, with a smaller number joining the Open VLD, Vlaams Blok or the CD&amp;V.

<doc id="289456" wikidata="Q1510441" url="?curid=289456" title="Sociaal-Liberale Partij">
<text>Sociaal-Liberale Partij (, abbr. SLP; Dutch for Social Liberal Party) was a Belgian Flemish political party formed after dissolution of the moderate nationalist People&#x27;s Union (&quot;Volksunie&quot;) party. Prior to 19 April 2008 it was known as Spirit, and intermediately as Flemish Progressives (VlaamsProgressieven). The party merged with Groen in the end of 2009, ceasing to exist.

== History ==
The People&#x27;s Union split up into two parties, the social liberal Spirit and the centre-right New-Flemish Alliance (N-VA), which formed an electoral alliance with the Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&amp;V) party. The formation of the alliances was seen as a way in which Spirit and N-VA could guarantee their influence and position in Flemish and Belgian politics. This led the liberal wing to initially opt for an Alliance with Flemish Liberals and Democrats.

==Abbreviation==
Spirit was the abbreviation for 
*Sociaal (Social)
*Progressief (Progressive)
*Internationaal (International)
*Regionalistisch (Regional)
*Integraal-democratisch (Completely democratic)
*Toekomstgericht (Future oriented)

==2007 elections==

In the 10 June 2007 general elections, the Social Liberal party was in an electoral alliance with Socialist Party Different (sp.a) and won 14 out of 88 Flemish seats in the Chamber of Representatives and 4 out of 40 Flemish seats in the Senate.

In the autumn of 2008, following a scandal causing its leader, Bettina Geysen to step down, the Social Liberal Party ended its cooperation with SP.A. Geert Lambert was elected the new leader. Many prominent party members, including cofounder Bert Anciaux, left the party.

<text>Alexander Gavrilovich Shliapnikov (; August 30, 1885 – September 2, 1937) was a Russian communist revolutionary, metalworker, and trade union leader. He is best remembered as a memoirist of the October Revolution of 1917 and as the leader of the Workers&#x27; Opposition, one of the primary opposition movements inside the Russian Communist Party during the 1920s.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Alexander Shliapnikov was born August 30, 1885, in Murom, Russian Empire to a poor family of Russian ethnicity and of the Old Believer religion. His father died when he was a small child. In 1898, at the age of 13, Shliapnikov began factory work at the Kondratov factory in Vacha, and one year later began working in Sormovo factories in Nizhny Novgorod, where he had his first encounter with Marxist literature. At the invitation of his older brother Peter, Shliapnikov moved to St. Petersburg in late 1900, beginning work alongside his brother at the Semyannikov (also known as Nevsky) factory, and rapidly became involved in labor unrest there. By age fifteen, Shliapnikov had been blacklisted and could no longer find work at the major factories in St. Petersburg, and was forced to return to Sormovo, where he once again found himself unemployable due to his suspected radicalism. While in Sormovo, he was entrusted with illegal literature to distribute back in Murom, which he later designated as his initiation into the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party.

===Pre-Revolution Activities===
====1905 and Emigration from Russia====
According to Shliapnikov himself, he joined the Bolsheviks in 1903, the year of their split with the Mensheviks. He continued to work as a factory worker in Murom even as he deepened his involvement in political activism, and in 1904 he was arrested for distribution of illegal literature. Shliapnikov managed to convince the prosecutor that he had been entrapped by police provocateurs, and thus won his freedom, but also attracted the attention of the local Black Hundreds, who brutally assaulted him on his way home. Undeterred, Shliapnikov continued his revolutionary activities, and during the 1905 revolution, he led an armed demonstration of workers in Murom, helping to take the local police chief hostage and force the police to retreat, resulting in another arrest. Even after being freed by the general amnesty issued in October, his continued militancy and intransigence saw him jailed for a third time, in a prison stint which would last until January 1907. Almost immediately after his release, Shliapnikov was drafted into the army, and after refusing to take an oath of loyalty to the Tsar, the police once again arrested him. Freed on bail, he vanished into the underground, finding work in the Electrical Station of 1886 in St. Petersburg, where he met fellow metalworker Sergei Medvedev, establishing what would become a decades long friendship. Later in 1907, the now 22-year-old Shliapnikov became a member of the Petersburg Committee of the RSDRP(b), and due to his growing prominence, at the end of 1907 his friends advised him to emigrate from Russia. Entrusted with letters for Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, he left Russia in January 1908, and after arriving in Switzerland by February 6, where he had a brief meeting with Lenin, continued onwards to Paris, and within two months Shliapnikov found work in an automobile factory in the suburb of Asnières.

====In Exile====
Shliapnikov acclimated well to life in Paris, improving his French language skills, giving speeches, writing articles, and participating in both Russian émigré politics and French trade unionism, all while continuing to work as a metalworker. He joined a regional committee of the SFIO and became a leader in the Parisian Mechanics’ Trade Union, putting him into contact with a diverse collection of French, German, Swedish, and Norwegian metalworkers and trade unionists. Shliapnikov also became romantically involved with Alexandra Kollontai in 1911, who at that time was still a Menshevik, and with her travelled to Germany in January 1912, but he did not adjust well to life there, and within a few months returned to France, although he continued to visit Kollontai in Germany. During this time period, Shliapnikov began to write more frequently, and became involved in French trade union debates, arguing against both &quot;non-political&quot; unionists, whose efforts he perceived as only weakening unions, and anarcho-syndicalists, who he accused of condescension towards the masses and an unwillingness to draw them into revolutionary work.

====World War I====
By the spring of 1914, Shliapnikov found himself unable to obtain industrial work, and as such resolved to return to Russia, which he did in April 1914, and due to his distrust of police informant Roman Malinovsky and habit of avoiding group meetings, managed to evade the wave of arrests which befell so many Bolsheviks in the summer of 1914. Refusing a position in the central Bolshevik party organization, he found employment as a metalworker, pretending to be a French worker to evade the authorities, while continuing to participate in the Bolshevik underground. The outbreak of World War I forced Shliapnikov to leave Russia, as the French government recalled its citizens and thereby destroyed his cover, and in September 1914, the Petersburg Committee sent him to Scandinavia. Due to the outbreak of war, Sweden, which had remained neutral, became one of the only routes by which Bolshevik emigres could communicate with Russian Bolsheviks, but despite successfully organizing a route into Russia using Swedish transport workers, Shliapnikov found himself unable to obtain either industrial work in Sweden or funding from Russian party organizations. Forced to take out loans from Swedish socialists, he sent several packages of material to Russia, proposing potential smuggling routes, but received no response, and his smuggling network lost too many links to continue operating. Kollontai, who was also living in Sweden, assisted him in these ventures, but was arrested for her anti-war activities and deported to Copenhagen, and Swedish socialists encouraged Shliapnikov to leave voluntarily so he could re-enter the country at a later date. Traveling to London in April 1915, he almost immediately found work as a turner at the Fiat automobile plant in Wembley, and while there joined the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and participated in their activities.

By August 1915, Shliapnikov had collected enough money to re-establish the Bolshevik smuggling network in Scandinavia, but he quickly became convinced that he needed to return to Russia to set up operations from that end, and left Scandinavian operations in the hands of Nikolai Bukharin, Yevgenia Bosch, and Georgy Pyatakov. According to instructions from Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev, he was to set up a small bureau of the Central Committee in Russia, and recruit members only from workers, such as Vasily Schmidt, and to produce a resolution on the war. To ensure he had sufficient authority to conduct his tasks, Lenin and Zinoviev co-opted Shliapnikov onto the Central Committee, and he successfully arrived in Petrograd in October 1915. Unfortunately for Shliapnikov, the police agent Miron Chernomazov, a leading member of the Petersburg Committee of the Bolsheviks, fiercely fought against his efforts to set up a Russian Bureau, and he rapidly found himself intensely surveilled by police agents. Nevertheless, despite police efforts and a lack of funds, Shliapnikov succeeded in setting up a functional Bolshevik center linked to the Central Committee with the assistance of fellow worker-Bolsheviks like Yury Lutovinov and Lenin&#x27;s sisters. After a month long tour of the provinces, he returned to Petrograd in January 1916 and found the Petersburg Committee facing a revolt from Bolshevik insurance organizers. Shliapnikov&#x27;s support for the insurance organizers led Chernomazov and the Committee to condemn him, only for Shliapnikov to propose Chernomazov&#x27;s expulsion from the Committee. After a new session of the Committee withdrew its condemnation, Chernomazov managed to remain among party leaders, albeit with a weakened position. Despite all of Shliapnikov&#x27;s efforts, the Okhrana rapidly arrested the majority of the Russian Bureau after he left Russia in February 1916, and when he returned to Scandinavia, he had to re-establish the smuggling network due to arrests by Swedish police.

While in Scandinavia, Shliapnikov became embroiled in a spat between Lenin, Bukharin, Bosch, and Pyatakov over the proper attitude towards nationalism, which halted production of the journal &quot;Kommunist&quot; and disrupted the flow of literature and communication to Russia. Frustrated and angered by the disruption of practical work for the sake of factionalism, he accused Lenin of &quot;nepartiinost&quot;, castigated Bukharin, Bosch, and Pyatakov for being incompetent organizers, and during the Summer of 1916, set off for America with the goal of raising funds. At the same time, Kollontai decided to end her relationship with Shliapnikov, and chose to leave a letter indicating as such for him to read upon his return, and he would not see her again until March 1917 in Petrograd, when he harshly rebuked her for having broken up with him in such a &quot;rude&quot; and &quot;hurtful&quot; fashion. Shliapnikov had little success fundraising in America, but upon returning to Scandinavia in September 1916, he recommended that Bukharin travel to America to provide an articulate Bolshevik voice in the pages of the socialist magazine Novy Mir.

====1917====
Shliapnikov eagerly returned to Russia in October 1916. To help him rebuild the Russian Bureau, he recruited Vyacheslav Molotov and Petr Zalutskii, and they were the senior Bolsheviks in Petrograd during the February Revolution in 1917. Under Shliapnikov, the Russian Bureau took a stance of opposition towards the provisional government, and called for the Petrograd Soviet to form a revolutionary government. The arrival of more prominent Bolsheviks like Lev Kamenev and Joseph Stalin from Siberian exile brought on a struggle over leadership and the correct stance towards the war. The &quot;moderates&quot; under Kamenev successfully outmaneuvered the Russian Bureau, seizing control of the party newspaper Pravda, and refusing to publish Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s &quot;Letters from Afar&quot; urging opposition to the provisional government. On March 15, Kamenev published an editorial supporting the war effort, and by March 18 had persuaded the Petersburg committee to provide &quot;conditional support&quot; to the provisional government. 

The arrival of Vladimir Lenin in Petrograd during April seriously challenged the dominant &quot;moderate&quot; line and brought about a shift in the party&#x27;s positions, but Shliapnikov, hospitalized for weeks due to an automobile accident, did not play a major role in this affair. Instead, Shliapnikov and Konstantin Eremeev played a leading role in organizing a &quot;Workers&#x27; Guard&quot; among radical workers in the Vyborg district of Petrograd, and in August 1917, Shliapnikov joined the newly formed general staff of the Red Guard. On May 7, Shliapnikov was elected to the central board of the Petrograd Metalworkers&#x27; Union alongside the unaligned socialist Aleksei Gastev and the Menshevik I.G. Volkov, and once he recovered from his automobile accident, he chaired the first Central Committee of the Petrograd Metalworkers&#x27; Union on May 27. By June 11, the Union had established a system of supporting unemployed workers, set up the journal &quot;Metallist&quot;, begun to mediate conflicts between workers and industrialists. Over the next month, delegates from across Russia formed the first All-Russian Metalworkers&#x27; Union, and Shliapnikov found himself elected to its central committee alongside three other Bolsheviks, Volkov and three other Mensheviks, and Gastev. Due to Gastev&#x27;s support, he was elected as chairman of the Central Committee during its first meeting on June 29. He led negotiations of a wage agreement between Petrograd metalworkers and factory owners in 1917.

===After the revolution===
Following the October Revolution and the Bolshevik seizure of power, Shliapnikov was appointed Commissar of Labor. Shliapnikov supported a coalition government composed of left socialist parties, and signed Zinoviev&#x27;s and Kamenev&#x27;s statement supporting a socialist coalition government, but unlike other &quot;moderates&quot; refused to resign from his post. The coalition agreement reached with the Left-SRs mollified most of the &quot;moderate&quot; Bolsheviks, and Shliapnikov would later claim that he only supported an alliance with the Left-SRs. In contrast to his &quot;moderate&quot; position in regards to coalitions with other socialist parties, Shliapnikov held a decisively &quot;radical&quot; stance towards the Constituent Assembly. The Bolshevik CC assigned him to take control of Bolshevik preparations for the Constituent Assembly, countering Zinoviev&#x27;s and Kamenev&#x27;s efforts to install a &quot;moderate&quot; provisional bureau which would support their stances, and Shliapnikov wholeheartedly supported the dispersal of the Constituent Assembly over the course of January 18 and 19. 

Shliapnikov played an important role in evacuating industry from Petrograd, as the Germans approached in 1918. As Commissar of Labor, he helped draft important directives on workers&#x27; control of industry and nationalization of industry and he staffed government bureaucracies with staff from trade unions. In the summer of 1918, he went to the south of Russia on a mission to gather food for the population of the Bolshevik-controlled cities of Northern Russia.

In October 1918 Shliapnikov was replaced as Commissar of Labor by Vasili Schmidt and then initially served as a member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Southern Front, chaired by Stalin in Tsaritsyn, and shortly after as Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Caspian-Caucasian Front, based in Astrakhan, which he had proposed to create. During the Civil War, Shliapnikov began to criticize the increasing tendency of the Russian Communist Party and Soviet government to rely on authoritarian measures to enforce policies towards industry and industrial workers. To Shliapnikov, denial of workers&#x27; right to participate in economic decision-making was a step away from the goals of the 1917 revolution.

===Opposition leader===
Shliapnikov became leader of the Workers&#x27; Opposition movement inside the Russian Communist Party. Alexandra Kollontai was a mentor and advocate of the group, which was composed of leaders of trade unions and industry who were all former industrial workers, usually metalworkers. This movement advocated the role of workers, organized in trade unions, in managing the economy and the political party. The Russian Communist Party leaders succeeded in suppressing the Workers&#x27; Opposition and in 1921–22 finally subordinated trade union leadership to the Party. In 1921, Shliapnikov was forced out of his elected post as chairman of the Metalworkers&#x27; Union.

In 1922, Shliapnikov and some other trade-unionists from within and outside the Workers&#x27; Opposition, supported by Alexandra Kollontai, presented an appeal, called the Letter of the Twenty Two, to the Communist International Executive, requesting that the Comintern help heal a &quot;rift&quot; within the Russian Communist Party between Party leaders and workers. Party leaders and Party-controlled media condemned the appeal. Two of the signatories of the appeal were expelled from the Party, but Shliapnikov, Kollontai, and Sergei Medvedev narrowly escaped expulsion.

Shliapnikov turned to writing his memoirs and held jobs in metals import and economic planning institutions. The Party Central Control Commission investigated him and Sergei Medvedev in 1926 and in 1930 for alleged factionalism in connection with the formation of oppositionist groups among workers in Baku and Omsk. In 1932, the Party Politburo ordered Shliapnikov to publish a public confession of &quot;political errors&quot; in writing his memoirs of the revolution, under pain of being purged from the party. He &quot;acknowledged mistakes in his memoirs of 1917, but in language that made his errors appear less grievous [...] Nevertheless, the &#x27;confession&#x27; as it appeared in &quot;Pravda&quot; on 9 March changed his claim of having been misunderstood to a cruder and more thorough repentance. Kaganovich may have dictated this &#x27;confession&#x27;. Secondary and tertiary literature has gone so far as to interpret the March 1932 statement as a repudiation of all his former oppositional stances in party discussions. In fact, the original statement Shliapnikov wrote and signed was not even a complete repudiation of his memoirs&quot;.

===Death and legacy===
Shliapnikov was expelled from the Communist Party in 1933 and imprisoned in 1935 for alleged political crimes. Charged under Article 58 of the RSFSR Criminal Code, he did not confess guilt or implicate others. Nevertheless, he was found guilty, based on others&#x27; testimony, and was executed on September 2, 1937.

His wife was also arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison, while their three children were dispatched to separate orphanages, being only later permitted to reunite. In 1948–1951 all three children, who were not older than 20, and their mother were arrested during a new wave of terror and sentenced to prison camp in Siberia, the only female child, Irina, getting her sentence immediately changed to internal exile in Krasnoyarsk. They were all released in the mid-1950s. Shliapnikov was posthumously rehabilitated in 1963 and restored to membership in the Communist Party in 1988.

In an address delivered in 1975 at an AFL–CIO meeting in Washington, DC, Nobel laureate, Russian dissident, and famed author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn asserted that &quot;before the Revolution the head of the Communist Party of Russia was Shliapnikov – not Lenin&quot; and that Shliapnikov&#x27;s name was unknown because he represented the true interests of the workers, in contrast to the émigré intellectuals who dominated the upper ranks of the party.

<text>Wayne Woodrow &quot;Woody&quot; Hayes (February 14, 1913 – March 12, 1987) was an American college football coach and player. He served as the head football coach at Denison University from 1946 to 1948, Miami University in Oxford, Ohio from 1949 to 1950, and Ohio State University from 1951 to 1978, compiling a career college football coaching record of 238–72–10. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1983.

During his 28 seasons as the head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes football program, Hayes&#x27; teams were recognized five times by NCAA consensus selectors as national champions (1954, 1957, 1961, 1968, 1970), credited as three – 1954, 1957, 1968 – by the major wire-services: AP Poll and Coaches&#x27; Poll. Additionally, his Buckeye teams captured 13 Big Ten Conference titles, and amassed a record of 205–61–10.

Over the last decade of his coaching tenure at Ohio State, Hayes&#x27;s Buckeye squads faced off in a fierce rivalry against the Michigan Wolverines coached by Bo Schembechler, a former player under and assistant coach to Hayes. During that stretch in the Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry, dubbed &quot;The Ten Year War&quot;, Hayes and Schembechler&#x27;s teams won or shared the Big Ten Conference crown every season and usually each placed in the national rankings.

==Early years==
A native of Clifton, Ohio, Hayes was the youngest of three children born to Wayne B. and Effie ( Hupp) Hayes. He played center at Newcomerstown High School in Newcomerstown, Ohio. At Denison University, he played tackle under coach Tom Rogers, and was a member of Sigma Chi fraternity. After graduating from Denison in 1935, Hayes went on to serve as an assistant at two Ohio high schools: Mingo Junction in 1935–1936 and New Philadelphia in 1937. When New Philadelphia head coach John Brickels left to accept another position, Hayes was elevated to the head coaching position, where he put together a 17–2–1 record in his first two seasons before enduring a 1–9 record in 1940.

Hayes enlisted in the United States Navy in July 1941, eventually rising to the rank of Lieutenant Commander during World War II. He commanded &quot;PC 1251&quot; in the Palau Islands invasion and the destroyer-escort USS &quot;Rinehart&quot; in both the Atlantic and Pacific operations. He earned a reputation for beating up officers and sailors who violated regulations or failed to follow orders. 

As World War II was near its end, and Hayes&#x27; alma mater, Denison University, was pursuing plans to reinstate its football program (which had been suspended during the war), it contacted former head coach Rogers (also in the Navy) about rejoining the program as head coach. Rogers declined, but recommended that his former team captain, Hayes, should be named the next head coach. Denison was able to locate and give Hayes an offer, which he accepted, minutes before his Navy ship was to begin the voyage through the Panama Canal — meaning Hayes would have been for an extended period of time.

==Coaching at Denison and Miami (OH) University==
Upon returning to Denison in 1946, Hayes had a hard first year, winning only 2 games, over Capital and the season finale against Wittenberg. However, that victory sparked a 19-game winning streak, a surge that propelled him into the head coaching position at Miami University. Miami is recognized as the &quot;Cradle of Coaches&quot; because of its history of outstanding coaches starting their careers there, such as Paul Brown, Ara Parseghian, Weeb Ewbank, John Pont, Bill Mallory, Sid Gillman, Randy Walker, and Bo Schembechler. After the 1947 season, Gillman moved down the road to coach at the University of Cincinnati, which was then Miami&#x27;s chief rival. Hayes and Gillman maintained a sparkling feud between themselves, combining mutual distaste for the other&#x27;s coaching style, and because they were in recruiting competition in the same general area.

In his second year with the Miami Redskins, Hayes led the 1950 team to an appearance in the Salad Bowl, where they defeated Arizona State. That success led him to accept the Ohio State head coaching position on February 18, 1951, in a controversial decision after the university rejected the applications of other more well-known coaches, including former Buckeyes&#x27; head coach Paul Brown, incumbent Buckeye assistant Harry Strobel, and Missouri head coach Don Faurot.

==Ohio State==

As head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes, Hayes led his teams to a 205–61–10 record (.761), including three consensus national championships (1954, 1957, and 1968), two other non-consensus national titles (1961 and 1970), 13 Big Ten conference championships, and eight Rose Bowl appearances. As of November 2024, his 205 wins is the most by a coach in the Big Ten Conference. Hayes was a three-time winner of The College Football Coach of the Year Award, now known as the Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant Award, and was &quot;the subject of more varied and colorful anecdotal material than any other coach past or present, including fabled Knute Rockne&quot;, according to biographer Jerry Brondfield.

Hayes&#x27; basic coaching philosophy was that &quot;nobody could win football games unless they regarded the game positively and would agree to pay the price that success demands of a team.&quot; His conservative style of football (especially on offense) was often described as &quot;three yards and a cloud of dust&quot;—in other words, a &quot;crunching, frontal assault of muscle against muscle, bone upon bone, will against will.&quot; The basic, bread-and-butter play in Hayes&#x27; playbook was a fullback off-guard run or a tailback off tackle play. Hayes was often quoted as saying &quot;only three things can happen when you pass (a completion, an incompletion, and an interception) and two of them are bad.&quot;

In spite of this apparent willingness to avoid change, Hayes became one of the first major college head coaches to recruit African-American players, including Jim Parker, who played both offensive and defensive tackle on Hayes&#x27; first national championship team in 1954. While Hayes was not the first to recruit African-Americans to Ohio State, he was the first to recruit and start African-Americans in large numbers there and to hire African-American assistant coaches.

Another Hayes recruit, Archie Griffin, was the only two-time Heisman Trophy winner in seven decades of selections. Altogether, Hayes had 58 players earn All-America honors under his tutelage. Many notable football coaches, such as Lou Holtz, Bill Arnsparger, Bill Mallory, Bo Schembechler, Doyt Perry, Ara Parseghian and Woody&#x27;s successor, Earle Bruce, served as his assistants at various times.

Hayes often used illustrations from historical events to make a point in his coaching and teaching. When Hayes was first hired to be the head coach at Ohio State, he was also made a &quot;full professor of physical education&quot;, having earned an M.A. degree in educational administration from Ohio State in 1948. The classes he taught were usually full, and he was called &quot;Professor Hayes&quot; by students. Hayes also taught mandatory English and vocabulary classes to his freshman football players. One of his students was a basketball player named Bobby Knight, who later became a legendary basketball coach.

During his time at Ohio State, Hayes&#x27; relationships with students and faculty members were particularly good. Even those members of the faculty who believed that the role of intercollegiate athletics was growing out of control respected Hayes personally for his commitment to academics, the standards of integrity with which he ran his program, and the genuine enthusiasm he brought to his hobby as an amateur historian. Hayes often ate lunch or dinner at the university&#x27;s faculty club, interacting with faculty and administrators.
As a coach and an educator, Hayes was one of the first to use the motion picture as a teaching and learning tool. He was also memorable in that he could often be seen walking across campus, taking the time to visit with students. When talking to young people, Hayes treated all with respect, without regard to race or socio-economic class. This behavior was helpful to Ohio State in quelling the violence and damage from anti-war demonstrations that other college campuses suffered in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He took the time to communicate with student leaders. Then-team quarterback Rex Kern said, &quot;Woody was out there on the Oval with the protesters, and he&#x27;d grab a bullhorn and tell the students to express their beliefs but not be destructive. He believed in Nixon, and he believed in the Establishment, but he wasn&#x27;t afraid to talk to the students. He wanted to stay close to the action.&quot; Hayes was considered one of the few authority figures that students then had respect for. His enthusiasm for coaching and winning was such that many across the nation consider the following maxim to be true: &quot;What Vince Lombardi was to professional football, Woody Hayes was to college football.&quot;

During his tenure at Ohio State, Hayes joked that he considered himself to be Notre Dame&#x27;s best recruiter because if he could not convince a recruit to come to Ohio State instead of Michigan he would try to steer the recruit to Notre Dame, whom Ohio State did not play. While Hayes&#x27; public stance was that he refused to play Notre Dame because he was afraid of polarizing the Catholic population in Ohio, Notre Dame&#x27;s long-time athletic director Edward &quot;Moose&quot; Krause said that Hayes had told him that Hayes liked having Michigan as the only tough game on the Ohio State schedule and that having the Buckeyes play Notre Dame would detract from that. Despite Hayes&#x27; apparent fear of playing more than one &quot;tough&quot; game a year, Ohio State still managed to schedule regular-season games with Nebraska, Washington, Southern California, UCLA, and Oklahoma during his tenure.

After losses or ties, Hayes conducted locker room interviews while completely naked. A journalist from his tenure noted, &quot;He was an ugly guy so it would clear the locker room out pretty fast.&quot;

==Controversies==
In 1959, following a 17−0 loss to USC, Hayes threw a punch at &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; sportswriter Al Bine, who had asked Hayes why he lost, but missed, and punched the brother of &quot;Pasadena Independent&quot; sports editor Bob Shafer in the back instead. In a May 1965 meeting of Big Ten Conference athletic directors and coaches, Hayes nearly started a fight with Iowa&#x27;s athletic director, Forest Evashevski, before being restrained.

Prior to the 1973 Rose Bowl, Hayes shoved a camera into the face of a news photographer. As a result, Hayes was suspended for three games, fined $2,000, and left California with a subpoena.

In 1977, a late fumble at Michigan caused Hayes to charge at ABC cameraman Mike Freedman, who recorded his frustration while laughing at him. Hayes was ejected, put on probation by the Big Ten Conference, and fined $2,000.

===1962 Rose Bowl vote===
In the 1961 season, Ohio State won the Big Ten championship, qualifying automatically for the Rose Bowl. At the time, the Big Ten Conference rules stated that the school&#x27;s Faculty Council must officially approve of the trip. In this unusual development, the Ohio State Faculty Council voted 28 to 25 against the 1962 Rose Bowl trip, prompted by the head of a university alumni group, on the grounds that the school&#x27;s academic reputation was suffering because of over-emphasis on the football team. Other reports stated that the bid was declined because Ohio State had already beaten their would-be Rose Bowl opponent, UCLA, during the regular season. The decision sparked minor rioting on the Ohio State Campus and in the Columbus area. The &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot; published the names, addresses, and phone numbers of those Faculty Council Members who voted against the trip as well as the amount of university money that they spent on the trips. While Hayes was diplomatic with some faculty members who voted against the trip and urged the students to cease complaining, he did not spare his criticism of the alumni club president who led the charge against accepting the bowl bid. Hayes confronted the alumni president, launched a profanity-laced tirade against him, punched him in the stomach and knocked the wind out of him. 

===Comments on the My Lai Massacre===
Speaking at a football banquet in 1969, Hayes spoke about the recently revealed My Lai Massacre. He stated that the Vietnamese men in My Lai deserved to die, &quot;and I wouldn&#x27;t be so sure those women were innocent. The children are obviously innocent – if they are less than five.&quot;

===Confrontation with Jerry Markbreit===

Late in the 1971 rivalry game against Michigan in Ann Arbor, furious over what he thought was a missed defensive pass interference foul committed by Thom Darden of Michigan, Hayes stormed onto the field, launched a profanity-laced tirade at referee Jerry Markbreit, and tore up the sideline markers, receiving a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Hayes then threw the penalty flag into the crowd, a kicking tee at Markbreit, began destroying the yard markers, and threw the first-down marker into the ground like a javelin before being restrained by Buckeyes team officials; Hayes was then assessed an additional 15-yard penalty and ejected. Hayes was suspended for one game and fined $1,000.

===1978 Gator Bowl incident and dismissal===
On December 29, 1978, the Buckeyes played in the Gator Bowl against Clemson. Late in the fourth quarter, Clemson was leading Ohio State 17–15. Freshman quarterback Art Schlichter managed to get Ohio State into field goal range. On third and 5 at the Clemson 24-yard line with 2:30 left and the clock running, Hayes called a pass rather than a run, because Schlichter was having a great game up to that point. Schlichter&#x27;s next pass was intercepted by Clemson nose guard Charlie Bauman, who returned it toward the Ohio State sideline, where he was run out of bounds. After Bauman stood up facing the OSU sideline Hayes punched him in the throat, triggering a bench-clearing brawl. Hayes stormed onto the field and in a profanity-laced tirade was abusive towards the referee. When one of Hayes&#x27; own players, offensive lineman Ken Fritz, tried to intervene Hayes turned on him and had to be restrained by defensive coordinator George Hill. The Buckeyes were assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for Hayes&#x27; attack on Bauman and his abuse towards the referee. Bauman was not injured by Hayes&#x27; punch and shrugged the incident off. Even though the game was being telecast by ABC, neither announcer Keith Jackson nor co-announcer Ara Parseghian saw or commented about the punch.

After the game, Ohio State Athletic Director Hugh Hindman, who had played for Hayes at Miami University and had been an assistant under him for seven years, privately confronted Hayes in the Buckeye locker room. He said that he intended to tell school president Harold Enarson about what happened, and strongly implied that Hayes had coached his last game at Ohio State. After a heated and profanity-laced exchange, Hindman said that he then offered Hayes a chance to resign, but Hayes refused, saying, &quot;That would make it too easy for you. You had better go ahead and fire me.&quot; Hindman then met with Enarson at a country club near Jacksonville, and the two agreed that Hayes had to go.

The next morning, after a brief but heated meeting in which profanities were exchanged, Hindman told Hayes that he had been fired. A press conference was held at the hotel where the team had been staying. The team returned to Columbus around noon, and Hayes left the airport in a state police car. Regarding Hayes&#x27; dismissal, Enarson said that &quot;there isn&#x27;t a university or athletic conference in this country that would permit a coach to physically assault a college athlete.&quot; After the incident, Hayes reflected on his career by saying, &quot;Nobody despises to lose more than I do. That&#x27;s got me into trouble over the years, but it also made a man of mediocre ability into a pretty good coach.&quot; About two months after the incident, Hayes called Bauman in his dorm room, but did not apologize for his previous attack on him. Earle Bruce succeeded Hayes as Ohio State&#x27;s head coach.

Many years later, Leonard Downie, Jr., former executive editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and student journalist at Ohio State, said he regretted not reporting an incident in the 1960s where Hayes instructed a player to take off his helmet and then hit him in the head. “I could have prevented so much trauma for so many” he said. “For that I am truly regretful.”

According to the 1994 HBO documentary &quot;American Coaches: Men of Vision and Victory&quot;, Hindman had placed Hayes on notice at the beginning of the 1978 season, not just for the swing at the ABC cameraman during the 1977 Michigan game, but also for hitting a player during practice. In his 1989 autobiography, Michigan&#x27;s Bo Schembechler wrote that he believed Hayes, who was diabetic and may have had a high blood sugar level, didn&#x27;t believe he struck Bauman. Schembechler also pointed out that Hayes had maintained that all he was trying to do was grab the ball away.

==Final days and death==
On March 11, 1987, Hayes was clearly in failing health when he had someone drive him in his pickup truck to Dayton to introduce Bo Schembechler, who was speaking at a banquet. Organizers had tried to discourage Hayes from attending, but Hayes insisted. He gave a lengthy introduction to Schembechler and then stayed to hear him speak before being driven back home.

The next morning, March 12, Hayes&#x27;s wife Anne found him unconscious in his bed at the couple&#x27;s home. He died of a heart attack at age 74. He is interred at Union Cemetery in Columbus, Ohio.

==Legacy==
Hayes&#x27;s lifetime record of 238–72–10 placed him ninth in all-time NCAA Division I FBS coaching victories. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983.

At Hayes&#x27;s funeral at First Community Church in Marble Cliff, Ohio on March 17, 1987, former president Richard Nixon delivered the eulogy before a crowd of 1,400, acknowledging the friendship that had begun between the two during his second term as vice president. Having met Hayes at a reception following a Buckeye win over Iowa in 1957, Nixon recalled, &quot;I wanted to talk about football. Woody wanted to talk about foreign policy. And you know Woody—we talked about foreign policy.&quot; The following day, more than 15,000 people took part in a memorial service at Ohio Stadium.

Following his death and in keeping with his wishes, the Wayne Woodrow Hayes Chair in National Security Studies was established at Ohio State&#x27;s Mershon Center for International Security Studies. Professor John Mueller currently holds the chair. In November 1987, the university dedicated the new Woody Hayes Athletic Center in his memory.

In an episode of the sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (season 1, episode 4, &quot;Hoodlum Rock&quot;), released the year of Hayes&#x27; football retirement, Andy Travis pranks Les Nessman by telling him that Woody Hayes has disappeared into the &quot;Cincinnati Triangle&quot;. Unlike other sports icons referenced in the series, Hayes did not make a direct appearance.

==Personal life==
Hayes married the former Anne Gross in 1942. Anne was a formidable and popular woman in her own right, who used to jokingly say at numerous sports banquets, &quot;Divorce Woody? Never! But there were plenty of times I wanted to murder him!&quot; The couple had one son, Steven, who went on to become a lawyer and judge. Coincidentally, the younger Hayes was assigned to the 2003 trial of former Ohio State standout Maurice Clarett. Judge Hayes (he had been on the Franklin County, Ohio Municipal Court) died in May 2022, at 76; his death was announced May 30.

===World War II movie host===
Because of his knowledge of military history and ongoing popularity, Hayes in the early 1980s hosted the broadcast of six World War II films for WBNS-TV in Columbus, which has served as the official outlet of Ohio State sports media programming for years, including the football coach&#x27;s shows. Among the movies broadcast were &quot;Patton&quot;, &quot;Midway&quot;, &quot;The Wackiest Ship in the Army&quot;, &quot;The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel&quot;, and &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!.&quot;

Hayes also gave salty historical perspectives related to each movie. Hayes&#x27; segments, depending upon the movie, were taped in such locations as Fort Knox, West Point, the , and Stuttgart, Germany, where he interviewed Manfred Rommel, Lord Mayor of Stuttgart and the son of Erwin Rommel.

<text>Eric Adam Avery (born April 25, 1965) is an American musician. He is best known as the founding bass guitarist and co-songwriter of the alternative rock band Jane&#x27;s Addiction, with whom he has recorded two studio albums. From 2005 to 2022, Avery was the bassist for Garbage, which he joined as sideman and with whom he recorded three studio albums.

A core member of Jane&#x27;s Addiction during its initial lifespan, Avery co-founded the band in 1985 with frontman Perry Farrell, and recorded two studio albums, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; (1988) and &quot;Ritual de lo Habitual&quot; (1990), before the band&#x27;s acrimonious break-up in 1991. Following Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s dissolution, Avery and guitarist Dave Navarro formed Deconstruction with drummer Michael Murphy, releasing one studio album in 1994. The following year, Avery began a solo project named Polar Bear, which he focused on between 1995 and 2000. Declining to take part in Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s 1997 and 2001 reunions, Avery eventually rejoined the band in 2008. The original core line-up of the band embarked on a co-headlining tour with Nine Inch Nails, with Avery departing in 2010 due to ongoing tensions with Farrell. In 2022, Avery rejoined Jane&#x27;s Addiction after a twelve-year absence, in advance of a co-headlining tour with the Smashing Pumpkins.

Alongside his work with Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Avery is a former member of Alanis Morissette&#x27;s backing band, and has been a touring and session musician for Garbage since 2005, contributing to the albums, &quot;Not Your Kind of People&quot; (2012), &quot;Strange Little Birds&quot; (2016) and &quot;No Gods No Masters&quot; (2021). Avery unofficially joined the Smashing Pumpkins in 2006 for a short spell, and was briefly a member of the rock supergroup Giraffe Tongue Orchestra.

To date, Avery has released two solo studio albums under his own name, &quot;Help Wanted&quot; (2008) and &quot;LIFE.TIME.&quot; (2013).

==Career==
Avery and Dave Navarro met as classmates at St. Paul the Apostle Grammar School in West Los Angeles, a Catholic parochial school founded by the Paulist Fathers. Eric went on to St. Monica High School of Santa Monica, California, and Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California. Dave was classmates at Notre Dame with Stephen Perkins. Stephen met Eric&#x27;s sister, Rebecca Avery, and they dated. Rebecca suggested that Eric and Perry Farrell audition Stephen as the drummer for Jane&#x27;s Addiction after Perry and Eric cofounded the band.

Avery participated in the Deconstruction project with Navarro immediately after Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s breakup, but initially declined invitations for Jane&#x27;s reunions. &quot;I&#x27;ve asked him,&quot; said Farrell before 2001&#x27;s Jubilee Tour, &quot;but he says he wants no part of it. What else can you say but, Good luck to ya?&quot;

Avery has recorded tracks for, toured with and briefly dated Alanis Morissette, as well as creating another side project, Polar Bear, in 1994. He was once suggested as the replacement bassist for Tool by former Jane&#x27;s Addiction and then-current Tool manager Ted Gardner. Eric declined the invitation, saying he wanted to concentrate on Polar Bear.

As seen in the film &quot;&quot;, Avery auditioned for Metallica, after the departure of bassist Jason Newsted. The role didn&#x27;t quite fit Avery and the band went with Ozzy Osbourne and Suicidal Tendencies bassist Robert Trujillo. Avery toured with the band Garbage to promote 2005&#x27;s &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot;. Avery has also performed with Peter Murphy, on tour and on 2004&#x27;s &quot;Unshattered&quot;.

Avery worked briefly with the revived Smashing Pumpkins, but ultimately did not join the band. He was not paid for his work, but said the sessions were a lot of fun: &quot;I went into [the Pumpkins] with the same mentality I took with me when I auditioned for Metallica – I expected to have a good story to tell my wife. I had no expectations. I had heard nothing but bad things about working with Billy, but I went, and I found it to be a really inspiring time.&quot; Billy Corgan ended up playing bass on what would become 2007&#x27;s &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; and hired Ginger Reyes for live performances.

In 2007, he contributed original music to the feature film documentary &quot;The 11th Hour&quot;. He also released his debut solo album &quot;Help Wanted&quot; in April 2008 through Dangerbird Records.

He finally performed with Jane&#x27;s Addiction – for the first time since 1991 – at the NME Awards in 2008. Jane&#x27;s played secret club shows in October and November 2008. On March 19, 2009, at South by Southwest Music festival in Austin, the quartet performed a 45-minute set at an abandoned Safeway grocery store.

Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s official website was updated in February 2009 stating that there was to be another club show soon. Photos of Avery, Perkins and Navarro, taken by Trent Reznor, appeared on Nine Inch Nails&#x27; official site, which led to speculation that Reznor was helping Jane&#x27;s record new material. The relationship led to the booking of the &quot;NIN/JA&quot; (Nine Inch Nails/Jane&#x27;s Addiction) tour, on which Avery played, and which evoked the first Lollapalooza tour of 1991, starring Jane&#x27;s and Nine Inch Nails.

On March 1, 2010, after a ten-date rescheduled tour in Australia, Avery stated on his Twitter page: &quot;the janes addiction experiment is at an end.&quot; Rumors were already spreading around a few weeks before, as Duff McKagan was said to be the new bassist for Jane&#x27;s, but Avery had kept his position for the remaining few dates of the 2009/2010 tour.

In February 2012, Justin Meldal-Johnsen commented on the talkbass.com forum that Avery would be joining Garbage on their upcoming tour. In early May 2012 Garbage uploaded a video from their rehearsal, performing the song &quot;Battle in Me&quot;, with Avery playing bass. Avery has since performed in the two Garbage tours that followed, the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary tour and the one for the album &quot;Strange Little Birds&quot;, in which Avery plays bass in six tracks.

Avery released his second solo album, entitled &quot;LIFE.TIME.&quot;, on February 15, 2013.

On February 25, 2013, Trent Reznor named Avery as the new touring bassist of Nine Inch Nails. Avery was slated to perform in the Twenty Thirteen Tour from Summer 2013 into 2014, but announced his withdrawal on May 15, 2013, stating that after a year travelling with Garbage he did not feel like going on another extended tour.

Avery composed the original soundtrack for &quot;Show Me What You Got&quot;, written and directed by &quot;Svetlana Cvetko&quot; and winner of the Grand Jury Prize ‘Best Film’ at Taormina Film Festival in 2019. 

In May 2023, Garbage officially announced Avery&#x27;s departure from the band after 18 years as its touring and recording bassist.

==Style==
A self-taught bassist, Avery has singled Peter Hook of Joy Division and New Order as his major influence on bass playing, considering that British bassists were deeper with the instrument as &quot;American rock bass is kick drum, it&#x27;s just kick drum and then the root note of what the guitar player is doing.&quot; In Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Avery stated that in the early phases the basslines would end up as a replacement rhythm guitar, &quot;sort of built on that so Dave can riff on it and Stephen also can riff on it&quot;. On his solo career, Avery only played the bass at the final stages of &quot;Help Wanted&quot;, instead &quot;focused on gadgets and keyboards and guitars and vocals and lyrics and other things like that&quot;. While playing with Garbage, Avery was for the first time &quot;playing a more traditional bass role in a rock band&quot; as his bass would only try to match Butch Vig&#x27;s drumming.

&quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking influenced me a lot, especially with what Eric Avery proposed from the bass,&quot; says Nick Oliveri, of Queens of the Stone Age, Kyuss and Mondo Generator. &quot;Eric had written the music on his own, the guitars and the drums came later. So he inspired me on that side&quot;

John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers stated on the &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot; commentary that his guitar playing style is influenced by Avery&#x27;s spacious and heavily melodic playing.

<text>The pedal is the part of a bicycle that the rider pushes with their foot to propel the vehicle. It provides the connection between the cyclist&#x27;s foot or shoe and the crank allowing the leg to turn the bottom bracket spindle and propel the bicycle&#x27;s wheels. A pedal usually consists of a spindle that threads into the end of the crank, and a body on which the foot rest is attached, that is free to rotate on bearings with respect to the spindle.

Pedals were initially attached to cranks connecting directly to the driven (usually front) wheel. The safety bicycle, as it is known today, came into being when the pedals were attached to a crank driving a sprocket that transmitted power to the driven wheel by means of a roller chain.

==Types==
Just as bicycles come in many varieties, there are different types of pedals to support different types of cycling.

===Flat and platform===

Traditionally, platform pedals were pedals with a relatively large flat area for the foot to rest on, in contrast to the quill pedal which had very little surface area.

One form of the platform pedal had a large flat top area and flat bottom for use with toe clips and toe straps. They were designed for greater comfort when using shoes with less than rigid soles. They typically had a smaller cutaway underside giving greater cornering clearance, which was often needed for track cycling. They were often marketed as being more aerodynamic than conventional quill pedals.

Attaching the shoes to the pedals gives the user more control over the pedal movements. There are two methods for attaching a cyclist&#x27;s shoes to their pedals: toe clips – a basket-and-strap device which hold the foot in place – and so-called clipless pedals, where specialized shoes with built-in bindings attach to compatible pedals.

In mountain biking (MTB) and BMX, platform pedals typically refer to any flat pedal without a cage. BMX riders typically use plastic pedals made of nylon, polycarbonate, or carbon reinforced plastic, although aluminum alloy and magnesium are not uncommon pedal body materials. Mountain bikers tend to use aluminum or magnesium because of the necessary use of metal studs to offer grip while the pedals are wet, muddy and slippery. BMXers tend to prefer platforms to cage pedals because they offer more support and grip for flexible &quot;skate&quot; shoes by using short metal studs. Cage pedals are more popular in the low end mountain bike range. In general, cage pedals are uncommon in all types of biking, although there is a niche market within mountain biking.

Platform pedals are available in a wide variety of types and prices, ranging from disposable plastic units used for test rides on new bicycles to high-end downhill models. Budget models may be made of steel or aluminum and incorporate reflectors for safer riding on streets at night, in addition to complying with some traffic laws. Less expensive platform pedals are generally considered disposable and cannot be rebuilt when worn out.

More expensive platform pedals for the mountain bike market are available with replaceable metal traction pins and cartridge bearings. Lightweight pedals intended for freeride and downhill cycling have been made from exotic metals such as magnesium.

Toe clips typically are generally not installed on this type of pedal because they are considered unsafe by some MTB and BMX riders. In downhill racing, the extra power and grip offered by clipped pedals is used at the risk of clipped in crashing in which the bicycle can potentially stay attached to the foot of the victim. However, fixed gear riders have started using fabric straps instead.

===Quill===

The quill pedal is a common pedal system on bicycles. It consists of a main axle section that is attached to the bicycle crank arm and contains extensions from the axle to which parallel cage plates are attached at the front and rear of the pedal. To use the quill pedal, the cyclist pushes his foot against the platform formed by the parallel cage plates.

To improve the performance of the quill pedal toe clips were added. The toe clip is a thin metal or plastic attachment to the front cage of the pedal. The toe clip is shaped like the toe of a shoe and its function is to prevent a cyclist&#x27;s shoe from slipping off the pedal during the forward pedaling motion. A further enhancement of the quill pedal was modifying the toe clip to allow a strap and buckle to go around or through both the pedal and the toe clip to encircle the cyclist&#x27;s foot on the top of the pedal. This strap is generally made of leather or nylon.

To further improve the quill pedal&#x27;s efficiency a &quot;cleat&quot; was developed. This cleat consists of a small metal or plastic attachment to the cyclist&#x27;s shoe. The cleat is slotted and is adapted to engage a quill section of the bicycle pedal. The use of the slotted cleat enhances a cyclist&#x27;s ability over that provided by toe clips and strap, enabling for greater pedaling efficiency. Although quill pedals can be used with smoothed-soled cycling shoes or ordinary shoes, they were designed to be used with cycling shoes which had a slotted shoeplate attached to its sole. The disadvantage with this system is that to remove the shoe from the pedal a rider had to reach down and loosen the strap by hand or leave the toe strap loose and thus give up some efficiency. This type of pedal and pedal setup was common for racing cyclists until the mid to late 1980s.

Quill pedals are sometimes said to be named for the quill or &quot;pick up tab&quot; on the rear of the pedal. The weight of the toe clip and strap would make the pedal hang upside down, and the rider would tap the quill with their shoe to flip the pedal over so the shoe could be inserted into the pedal.

The main difference between track, road, and touring quill pedals is width. Track pedals are narrow and the front and back plates of the cage are separate, road being a little wider with a one piece cage in a shape of a sideways &quot;U&quot;, and touring being the widest to allow for comfort when used with wider, non-racing shoes during longer rides.
While quill pedals can be used for mountain biking, the use of clips here is dangerous as they do not grip well. Cage pedals built for mountain biking are typically serrated so that even when muddied, the pedals can be gripped well by any flat shoe.
===Clipless pedals===

Clipless pedals (also clip-in or step-in) require a special cycling shoe with a cleat fitted to the sole, which locks into a mechanism in the pedal and thus holds the shoe firmly to the pedal. Most clipless pedals lock onto the cleat when stepped on firmly and unlock when the heel is twisted outward, although in some cases the locking mechanism is built into the cleat instead of the pedal. Clipless refers to the toe clip (cage) having been replaced by a locking mechanism and not to platform pedals which would normally not have toe clips.
The clipless pedal was invented by Charles Hanson in 1895. It allowed the rider to twist the shoe to lock and unlock and had rotational float (the freedom to rotate the shoe slightly to prevent joint strain).
The M71 was a clipless pedal designed by Cino Cinelli and produced by his company in 1971. It used a plastic shoe cleat which slid into grooves in the pedal and locked in place with a small lever located on the back side of the pedal body. To release the shoe a rider had to reach down and operate the lever, similar to the way a racing cyclist had to reach down and loosen the toestrap. The lever was placed on the outside edge of the pedal so that in the event of a fall the lever hitting the ground would release the foot. The pedal was designed for racing, in particular track racing, and because of the need to reach down to them to unclip, they have been referred to as &quot;death cleats&quot;.
In 1984, the French company Look applied downhill snow skiing binding or cleat technology to pedals, producing the first widely used clipless pedals. Initially used by triathletes to facilitate faster &quot;transitions&quot;, Bernard Hinault&#x27;s victory in Tour de France in 1985 then helped secure the acceptance of quick-release clipless pedal systems by cyclists. Those pedals, and compatible models by other manufacturers, remain in widespread use today. The cleat is engaged by simply pushing down and forward on the pedal, or, with some designs, by twisting the cleat in sideways. Then, instead of loosening a toestrap or pulling a lever, the cyclist releases a foot from the pedal by twisting the heel outward.

The next major development in clipless pedals was Shimano&#x27;s SPD (Shimano Pedaling Dynamics) pedal system. Whereas Look cleats are large and protrude from the sole of the shoe, SPD cleats are small and could be fitted in a recess in the sole, making it possible to walk (although comfort will vary, as the soles of different cycling shoes vary in their rigidity, depending on design). Cycling shoes have rigid soles to maximize power transfer and efficiency. They may be specific to road or mountain biking, or usable for both. Shoes designed for mountain biking typically have recessed cleats that do not protrude beyond the sole of the shoe, and have treads for walking on trails, as walking or carrying the bike is often required. Road cycling shoes are typically lighter than their mountain bike counterparts, and feature a protruding cleat and less weatherproofing. The protruding cleat makes these shoes impractical for walking, as doing so can damage the cleat. Mountain bike cleats can generally be mounted without difficulty to road shoes although sometimes an adapter is required. Such attachment is not usually possible for road pedals, as the cleats are normally too large to be mounted on mountain shoes. The smaller mountain bike cleats are attached to the sole of the shoe by two bolts; larger road-specific cleats are attached by three. Various manufacturers have produced their own designs of clipless pedal systems over the years.

Platform adapters are designed to temporarily convert clipless pedals into more traditional platform pedals which have a larger and flatter area for the foot to rest on. Clipless pedals can have advantages over flat ones, especially in mountain biking and racing. They keep the foot from slipping in wet and muddy conditions and provide better transfer of power. Clipless pedal platform adapters are innovative devices designed to convert regular platform pedals into a temporary clipless pedal system. These adapters provide cyclists with a bridge between traditional flat pedals and clipless pedals, allowing them to experiment with the benefits of clipless riding without immediately committing to dedicated clipless shoes. They can be fastened by using bolts but as they are normally in temporary use, it is also common for them to be mounted using different snap-on techniques. Although it is possible to use clipless pedals with regular footwear, they will be much less comfortable than platform pedals, as the shoe sole is more likely to bend or slip. Despite wide usage, there is no proven advantage of clipless pedals over flat pedals in pedaling effectiveness, net mechanical efficiency, and muscular activity for both non-cyclists and elite cyclists.

====Float and tension====
&quot;Float&quot; is defined as the degree of movement offered by the cleat within the pedal before release begins. This can be highly important to prevent damage to knees, as most people&#x27;s legs do not remain in a single plane as they pedal. Many standard road pedal systems offer cleats with a six-degree float. SPD-SL, Look Delta, Look Kéo, and Time cleats are also available in three-degree and zero-degree float. Road pedal systems commonly colour-code cleats by the amount of float offered. Some pedal systems have a fixed (non-adjustable) float, such as six degrees for Crankbrothers and 4.5 degrees for the Kéo Easy. Most cleats develop more float as they wear. Clipless float pedals significantly attenuate the applied moment without reducing the power transmitted to the bike suggesting using float systems to reduce or prevent knee pain.

===Magnet pedals===

Magnetic pedals were introduced as early as 1897, and the Exus Mag Flux Road was available in 1996. Norbert Sadler and Wolfgang Duerr filed for a patent in 2005, and it has not been granted as of 2012. Established bicycle component manufacturer, Mavic, introduced a magnetic pedal and dedicated shoe for casual riding in 2009. Others have received mixed reviews.

===Folding===
To maximize compactness, folding bicycles often have pedals that fold as well.
==Attachment==
The pedal spindle is threaded to match a threaded hole at the outboard end of the cranks. Multi-piece cranks have a hole with 20 TPI (a diameter/pitch combination fairly unique to this application). One-piece cranks use a by 20 TPI hole. French pedal spindles use M14 × 1.25 ( metric diameter with pitch) threads, and thread loosely into a 9/16 pedal hole. The threading size is often stamped into the crank, near the pedal hole.

The right-side (usually the drive-side) pedal spindle is right-hand threaded, and the left-side (usually the non-drive-side) pedal spindle is left-hand (reverse) threaded to help prevent it from becoming loose by an effect called precession.

Although the left pedal turns clockwise on its bearing relative to the crank (and so would seem to tighten a right-hand thread), the force from the rider&#x27;s foot presses the spindle against the crank thread at a point which rolls around clockwise with respect to the crank, thus slowly pulling the outside of the pedal spindle anticlockwise (counterclockwise) because of friction, and thus would loosen a right-hand thread.

For a short time in the early 1980s, Shimano made pedals and matching cranks that had a by 24 TPI interface. This was to allow a larger single bearing, as these pedals were designed to work with just one bearing on the crank side rather than the conventional design of one smaller bearing on each side.

<text>Robert Allen Labonte (born May 8, 1964) is an American semi-retired professional stock car racing driver and current analyst for &quot;NASCAR on Fox&quot;. He also currently competes part-time in the SMART Modified Tour, driving the No. 18L for Hermie Sadler and Bill Stanley. Labonte is the 2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion. He and his older brother, Terry Labonte, are one of only two pairs of brothers to have both won the Cup championships (along with Kurt Busch and Kyle Busch). He is also the uncle of former Xfinity Series race winner Justin Labonte.

A native of Corpus Christi, Texas, Labonte was the first driver (second overall) to have won both the Winston Cup championship (2000) and the Busch Series championship (1991) since Ned Jarrett and the first to do so under the revised points championship format. He also won the IROC title in 2001. Labonte is also the first driver to complete the NASCAR Triple Threat at the same track, by winning races at Martinsville in each of NASCAR&#x27;s top three racing series.

==Early life==
Labonte was born on May 8, 1964, in Corpus Christi, Texas. He began racing in 1969 in quarter midgets in his home state of Texas, winning his first feature race one year later. From then until 1977, he drove in quarter-midgets throughout the United States, winning many races. In 1978, he advanced to the go-kart ranks but moved to North Carolina with his family following older brother Terry&#x27;s advancement to the Winston Cup Series. In 1980, Bobby made his NASCAR International Sedan Series debut in Atlanta, finishing third. Two years later, he made his debut in the NASCAR Xfinity Series (subsequently rebranded as the Busch Series) at Martinsville Speedway, where he finished 30th. Following his graduation from Trinity High School in 1982, he worked as a fabricator on Terry&#x27;s cars at Hagan Racing. Labonte returned to the Busch Series in 1985, running two races in a car he owned himself at Martinsville. In his first race, he finished 30th, bringing home only $220, but he improved to 17th place in his next race.

The next season, he helped prepare a car that his older brother would drive, which resulted in Terry&#x27;s first ever NASCAR Busch Grand National Series pole position start and a subsequent second-place finish at Road Atlanta. Labonte&#x27;s main success came driving late-model stock cars. In 1987, Labonte won twelve races at Caraway Speedway, clinching the track championship, in addition to working for Jay Hedgecock. The following season, he competed at Concord Motorsports Park, winning six times, and ran six more Busch races, finishing 16th at Darlington Raceway. The next season, he ran seven more races in the Busch Series and had his first top-five finish at North Carolina Speedway to go with two more finishes in the top ten.

==Full-time driving==
===Busch/Nationwide/Xfinity===
====1990====
By 1990, Labonte had finally earned enough money to race in the Busch Series on a full-time basis. He founded his own team and drove the No. 44 Oldsmobile. He was successful, winning two poles (both at Bristol Motor Speedway), scoring six top-5s, and 17 top-10s. He ended up finishing fourth in the standings and was also voted the Busch Series&#x27; &quot;Most Popular Driver.&quot;

====1991====
In the next season, he continued his second-division success by winning the NASCAR Busch Series championship with two wins, 10 top-five, and 21 top-10 finishes. He also won his first Busch Series race, at Bristol, then won again at O&#x27;Reilly Raceway Park in August.
In addition to his Busch Series schedule, he made two Winston Cup starts in a Bobby Labonte Racing car at Dover International Speedway and Michigan International Speedway, finishing 34th and 38th, respectively. He won his first Busch Series title.

====1992====
Labonte&#x27;s 1992 season was a successful one, and he ended up winning three races (at Lanier, Hickory, and Martinsville respectively), but lost the championship title to Joe Nemechek by three points. That championship finish is, to date, the second-closest finish in the history of NASCAR&#x27;s top three series (behind the tiebreaker between Tony Stewart and Carl Edwards in the Sprint Cup Series in 2011).

====1993====
In 1993, Labonte was called up by Bill Davis Racing to drive in the Winston Cup Series. He signed a contract to drive the No. 22 Ford Thunderbird. In his rookie season, he won his first pole at Richmond International Raceway, collected six top-10s, and finished 19th in points. He was also second place behind Jeff Gordon for Rookie of the Year honors. He also competed in two Busch Series races, winning a pole and finishing second and 24th respectively. Also, Labonte continued to operate his main Busch Series team, hiring David Green to drive for him. Green finished third in points for Bobby Labonte Racing.

====1994====
The next season, 1994, Labonte achieved his second major success as a car owner when his Busch Series driver, David Green, won the championship. It was the second championship, and fifth top-five points finish in five years for Bobby Labonte Racing. He also ran in the Busch Series himself, making 12 starts and earning a victory at Michigan in August. In addition to his Busch Series exploits, Bobby continued running full-time in the Winston Cup series for Bill Davis Racing. He collected one top-5 and two top-10s and finished 21st in the standings, just missing out on the top 20 because of Todd Bodine&#x27;s two-position points standings gain in the final race of the season.

====1996–present====
In 2007, Labonte won the Busch Series race at Talladega Speedway in April 2007, edging Tony Stewart to the line in a thrilling finish. This was his first Busch Series win since 1998. In the offseason following the 2007 season, Labonte agreed to a 15-race contract to drive the No. 21 Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing in the now-Nationwide Series for the 2008 season. RCR&#x27;s No. 21 team earned six victories in 2007 with driver Kevin Harvick and has earned two of the organization&#x27;s four series championships.
In 2016, Labonte returned to Joe Gibbs Racing to compete in the Xfinity Series opener at Daytona, driving the No. 18 Camry.

===Cup Series===

====1995–2000====

At the end of the 1994 season, Labonte departed to replace Dale Jarrett as the driver of the No.18 Interstate Batteries-sponsored Chevrolet for Joe Gibbs Racing. Labonte would pick up his first career win in the Coca-Cola 600 in 1995, a win he would call later in 2018 the favorite of his career. He would also go on to sweep the races at Michigan and finish 10th in the standings.

In 1996, Labonte won the season-ending race at Atlanta, the same race where his brother Terry won the championship. The two took a victory lap together in what Labonte said was one of the &quot;most emotional and memorable moments of [his] life&quot;. That year, he finished 11th in the points standings. In 1997, Gibbs switched car makes to a Pontiac Grand Prix. Labonte would go on to win the season-ending race at Atlanta for the second year in a row. He ended up seventh in the standings, his best finish at that point in his career.

In 1998, Labonte won at both Atlanta and Talladega, as well as pole positions for both Daytona races, finishing second to Dale Earnhardt in the 500. He finished the year in sixth in final points, improving by a position.

In 1999, Labonte won five Winston Cup races, the most he has ever won in a single season. He won at Dover in the spring, swept both Pocono races (he was the third to accomplish this particular sweep, after Bobby Allison in 1982 and Tim Richmond in 1986; since 1999, Jimmie Johnson in 2004, Denny Hamlin in 2006, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. in 2014 have also done this), the second Michigan race, and the season finale at Atlanta. However, during the season, he suffered a broken shoulder in an accident while qualifying for a Busch Series race at Darlington Raceway, but raced in the Cup event two days later. Labonte started the race, but at the 1st caution was relieved by Matt Kenseth. He finished second in the points to Dale Jarrett, losing the championship by 201 points.

In 2000, Labonte won four races, the early-season race at Rockingham, the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis, the Southern 500 at Darlington, and the fall race at Charlotte. He led the point standings for 25 weeks straight after taking over at California, and never relinquished it on the way to winning the Winston Cup championship, finishing ahead of Earnhardt by 265 points, completing all but nine of the 10,167 laps that season, with 4 wins, 19 top-five finishes, 24 top ten finishes, 3 poles, an average finish of 7.4, and had zero times of finishing with a Did not finish (DNF). Labonte became the second driver in NASCAR history to win the championship and not score a single DNF and first since Cale Yarborough in 1977. Labonte is currently the last to accomplish this.

====2001–2005====

Labonte began the 2001 season with a seventh-place finish in the Bud Shootout. At the Daytona 500, he and his teammate Tony Stewart were two of the 18 drivers involved in a crash on lap 173. Labonte&#x27;s hood broke off and got attached to Stewart&#x27;s car, which flipped over twice. After getting out of his, Labonte was seen checking on Stewart to make sure he was okay. The accident was overshadowed by Dale Earnhardt&#x27;s fatal crash on the last lap of the same race.

The following week at Rockingham, Labonte was narrowly beaten to the finish line by Steve Park in the rain-delayed Dura Lube 400. He did not have another Top 10 finish until the Virginia 500 at Martinsville, where he finished in eighth. This was followed by a fifth-place finish in the Talladega 500. His next Top 10 was another fifth-place finish in the Coca-Cola 600. After less successful finishes at Dover and Michigan, Labonte had a second eighth-place finish at Pocono and a seventh-place finish at Sonoma, and a third fifth-place finish in the Pepsi 400. At the end of July, Labonte won his first points race of the year in the Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono.

After the win, Labonte&#x27;s next Top 10 was a ninth-place finish at Watkins Glen, then eighth and third-place finishes at Bristol and Darlington, and a sixth-place finish at Richmond. He did not have back-to-back Top 10&#x27;s again until the autumn races at Charlotte and Martinsville, where he finished 10th and fourth respectively.

In the fall at Talladega, Labonte started 34th. He managed to work his way up the field and took the lead on lap 107. He led for 23 laps before falling back in the pack. He retook the lead on lap 184 but was involved in a frightening last-lap crash. After leading three laps, Labonte was leading at the white flag on the outside lane. Going into turn 1, Dale Earnhardt Jr. overtook him in the lower groove, bringing Tony Stewart and Jeff Burton with him. Labonte moved up the track, trying to block Bobby Hamilton, but coming onto the back straightaway, Hamilton tapped him from behind. Labonte made contact with Johnny Benson Jr. — sending that driver into the outside wall — and then spun, flipping over, and skidding partway down the track on his roof. This crash also collected Jason Leffler, Sterling Marlin, Robby Gordon, Mike Wallace, Ricky Craven, Terry Labonte, Buckshot Jones, Ricky Rudd, Ward Burton, and more.

Labonte&#x27;s next Top 10 was another ninth-place finish at Rockingham. After winning at Atlanta and a third-place finish at the postponed New Hampshire 300, he finished sixth in the final points standings.

During 2001, Labonte won the IROC XXV title, becoming the 13th consecutive NASCAR driver to win the IROC championship.

In 2002, Labonte only had one win, which was at Martinsville in the spring. He also drove a 9/11 Tribute car in 2002 with the phrase &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll&quot; on the hood. It was his first career short-track win at Martinsville. He went on to finish 16th in the final points standings and failed to finish in the Top 10 for the first time since 1996, while his teammate Stewart went on to win the championship.

In 2003, Labonte rebounded and finished eighth in the standings after winning two races (Atlanta and Homestead [leading only the final lap]). Also, Labonte went on a tear during the spring with three straight second-place finishes.

In 2004, Labonte did not win a race for the first time since 1994 (ten years later) and finished 12th in the standings.

2005 saw much of the same. Labonte fell out of the Top 20 in points, and only had four Top 5s, one of which was a dramatic second at Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway in the Coca-Cola 600. He also went on to race some Truck Series events, which included a win at Martinsville. His win there made him join an elite group of drivers that have won in all three divisions at one track. In fact, with his win, he became the first driver to do so.

He also ran the 24 Hours of Daytona road race, sharing a car with his brother Terry, Jan Magnussen and Bryan Herta. After the disappointing 2005 season, Labonte asked and was granted to be released from Joe Gibbs Racing, having spent the last eleven seasons there. Labonte joined Petty Enterprises to drive the famous No. 43.

====2006–2008====

In his inaugural season in the famous No. 43 car, Labonte collected three Top 5&#x27;s and eight Top 10&#x27;s. His Top 5&#x27;s included an impressive run at the Martinsville Speedway, where he finished third after being in contention for the win much of the day. He ended up finishing 21st in the points standings, three spots better than he did two years before.

Labonte began the 2007 season with a 21st-place finish in the Daytona 500, after avoiding the many accidents the race had. Labonte would end the year with no Top 5&#x27;s and only three Top 10&#x27;s. However, due to a more consistent season, he finished 18th in the standings, a three-position improvement over 2006. In November, Labonte formed a full-service marketing agency, Breaking Limits, which is based in Huntersville, North Carolina.

In 2008, Labonte continued his contract with Petty Enterprises, but experienced a largely unsuccessful season, gathering only three Top 10&#x27;s and no Top 5&#x27;s on his way to finishing 21st in the Sprint Cup point standings. In December of that year, Labonte was released from Petty Enterprises while the team was negotiating a deal with a private equity firm that fell through, and Petty partnered with Gillett Evernham Motorsports.

====2009====
On January 13, 2009, Labonte was confirmed to be the driver of the No. 96 Ford Fusion for Hall of Fame Racing, now in a partnership with Yates Racing. In the 2009 Spring Las Vegas race, the Shelby 427, Labonte recorded his first Top 5 with Hall of Fame Racing and his best finish since he finished third in the Fall Martinsville race in 2006. However, that was his only Top 5 run for the year. With eleven races remaining in the 2009 season, Labonte was replaced for Erik Darnell for 7 of the final eleven races due to sponsorship problems with the No. 96. Labonte found a ride with TRG Motorsports and it&#x27;s 71 for the 7 races he was out of the 96. In his first race at Atlanta, Labonte ran inside the Top 20 all night and scored an 18th-place finish. Two races later Labonte gave TRG its best qualifying effort with an eighth-place start, Labonte came home 22nd. At Talladega, Labonte finished 10th after, at one point, running second in that race to Dale Earnhardt Jr.

====2010====

From February 2010 – June 2010, Labonte drove for TRG Motorsports and its No. 71. Even though TRG&#x27;s 2009 owner points were not enough to make the field guaranteed for the first five races of 2010, Labonte&#x27;s past championship provisional gave the team that to fall back on, in the case that Labonte&#x27;s qualifying runs are not fast. For 2010, Labonte was also reunited with Doug Randolph as his crew chief. Randolph finished the 2007 season with Labonte in the No. 43 for Petty Enterprises, posting two of three of Labonte&#x27;s Top 10 runs. TRG also announced an alliance with Richard Childress Racing for 2010. RCR shared technology and equipment with TRG for the season. They also allied with Stewart Haas Racing, as Tony Stewart will provide a pit crew to the team.

In his first race in the TRG, Labonte finished 21st in the Daytona 500 after he started 42nd with a champions provisional. For much of the race, Labonte was in the Top 25. He would end up fading back over the next few races, as he and the team would struggle for consistency. On the May 16th Dover race, due to lack of sponsorship, Labonte and the 71 team parked the car after 66 laps. Arguably, some people might say that this season is the worst of his full-time career, as he only had two top 20 finishes in 2010 one at the Daytona 500 and one at the Infineon Raceway road course event.

On June 22, 2010, it was announced that Labonte would be leaving the No. 71 due to the team being unable to secure sponsorship. On June 23, Labonte was hired to drive car No. 7 for Robby Gordon Motorsports at New Hampshire in a one-race deal.

C&amp;J Energy Services entered into a partnership with Phoenix Racing which allowed Labonte to be hired to take over the No. 09 car beginning at Daytona and Labonte split the rest of the 2010 season between Phoenix Racing and TRG Motorsports. On October 11, Stavola-Labonte Racing hired Labonte to drive its No. 10 car at Charlotte and Texas in a two-race deal. The team is co-owned by Bobby&#x27;s older brother Terry. Despite bouncing around, Labonte competed in every race for the 2010 season.

====2011–2012====

Labonte replaced Marcos Ambrose as the full-time driver of the No. 47 JTG Daugherty Racing Toyota Camry, with support from Michael Waltrip Racing. He finished 4th in the Daytona 500, earning Labonte his 200th career top 10 finish in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Earning only one more top 10 finish so far in the season. JTG Daugherty Racing and Michael Waltrip Racing received a penalty for violating sections 12-1, 12-4-J, and 20-3.2.1A. Crew Chief Frankie Kerr was fined $50,000 and was suspended from 4 NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship events, and suspended from NASCAR until November, 23. The same penalty was for Michael Waltrip Racing and the car chief for each team. The owners of the numbers 47 (Tad Geschickter); 56 (Michael Waltrip); and 00 (Rob Kauffman); were penalized 25 owner points. The drivers were also penalized 25 driver points.

For the 2012 season, Labonte returned to the No. 47 car with most of the sponsors returning also. JTG Daugherty Racing also announced they will no longer operate out of the Michael Waltrip Racing shop. Todd Berrier took over the role as the crew chief. The crew chief at the time, Frank Kerr, moved to the position of shop foreman.

====2013–2016====
Labonte ran in the 47 for the entire season until the 2013 Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan International Speedway, in which he ran the No. 51 for Phoenix Racing. Labonte ran at Sonoma Raceway in the 47, but was subsequently replaced by A. J. Allmendinger in the 47 for selected races starting at the 2013 Quaker State 400 at Kentucky Speedway, ending Labonte&#x27;s streak of consecutive starts at 704. The streak was second only to Jeff Gordon&#x27;s. Later in the year Labonte suffered broken ribs in a cycling accident, forcing him to miss three races, starting with the AdvoCare 500 at Atlanta.

His last race with JTG Daughtery was at Phoenix International Raceway in November 2013; released afterwards, in December 2013 he announced that he would be running part-time in the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series in a second car for HScott Motorsports. During practice for the 2014 Daytona 500 Labonte blew an engine, and although he qualified for his 22nd consecutive 500, he was relegated to the back of the starting grid. Labonte finished the race in 15th.

A deal to run for James Finch in additional races fell through, thus Labonte did not make another start for the first half of the season. Instead, he tested cars for Richard Childress Racing. At the summer Daytona race, he drove the No. 33 RCR Chevrolet that Brian Scott had driven to the pole at Talladega, running under the Circle Sport banner. Labonte qualified 4th and contended for the lead at the beginning of the race, but was caught up in the Big One, finishing 26th. Tommy Baldwin Racing would field the No. 37 car with Accell Construction as the sponsor for Labonte at Indianapolis.

<text>Blaise Compaoré (born 3 February 1951) is a Burkinabé-Ivorian former politician who served as the second president of Burkina Faso from 1987 to 2014. He was a close associate of the first president, Thomas Sankara, during the 1980s and in October 1987 he led a coup d&#x27;état during which Sankara was killed. Subsequently, he introduced a policy of &#x27;rectification&#x27;, overturning the leftist and Third Worldist policies pursued by Sankara. He won elections in 1991, 1998, 2005, and 2010, in what were considered unfair circumstances. His attempt to amend the constitution to extend his 27-year term caused the 2014 Burkinabé uprising. On 31 October 2014, Compaoré resigned and fled to the Ivory Coast. In April 2022, he was found guilty by a special military tribunal of complicity in Sankara’s murder. He is the longest-serving president of Burkina Faso.

== Early career ==
Compaoré was born in Ziniaré, Upper Volta on 3 February 1951. His father was a military veteran of the Second World War. He studied at a Catholic school in Fada N&#x27;gourma, followed by a Lycée in Ouagadougou. His mother died suddenly when he was 15, followed by the death of his father several years later. Compaoré subsequently became very close to the family of Thomas Sankara, whose father Joseph treated him as his own son. After being expelled from the Lycée, Compaoré underwent basic military training. During his service he decided to pursue a military career, continuing his studies at the Yaoundé Military Academy in Cameroon. There he became acquainted with Henri Zongo and labor union leader Soumane Touré. Following the end of the 1974 Agacher Strip border clashes between Upper Volta and Mali, Compaoré was posted north of Ouahigouya. There he met Thomas Sankara, with whom he developed a close friendship.

Compaoré played a major role in the coups d&#x27;état against Saye Zerbo and Jean-Baptiste Ouedraogo. He has been married to Chantal Compaoré (née Chantal Terrasson de Fougères) since 1985.

Under Sankara&#x27;s leadership, which lasted from 1983 to 1987, Compaoré was his deputy and a member of the National Revolutionary Council. He served as Minister of State at the Presidency and subsequently as Minister of State for Justice.

== Politics ==
Compaoré was involved in the 1983 and 1987 coups, taking power after the second in which his predecessor Sankara was killed. He was elected as the president of Burkina Faso in 1991, in an election that was boycotted by the opposition, and re-elected in 1998, 2005 and 2010.

=== 1983 coup ===
On 4 August 1983, Compaoré organized a coup d&#x27;état, which deposed Major Jean-Baptiste Ouedraogo. The coup d&#x27;état was supported by Libya, which was, at the time, on the verge of war with France in Chad. Other key participants were Captain Henri Zongo, Major Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lingani and the charismatic Captain Thomas Sankara, who was pronounced President.

During the Agacher Strip War with Mali in December 1985, Compaoré commanded Burkinabé soldiers who split into small groups and employed guerrilla tactics against Malian tanks.

=== 1987 coup ===
Compaoré took power on 15 October 1987 in a coup during which Sankara was killed. Deteriorating relations with France and the neighboring Ivory Coast was the reason given for the coup. Compaoré described the killing of Sankara as an &#x27;accident&#x27;, but the circumstances have never been properly investigated. Upon taking the presidency, he reverted many of the policies of Sankara, claiming that his policy was a &#x27;rectification&#x27; of the Burkinabé revolution.

He initially ruled in a triumvirate with Henri Zongo and Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lingani: in September 1989 those two were arrested, charged with plotting to overthrow the government, summarily tried and executed.

=== First years and 1990s===
In October 1987, Compaoré and many others formed a new political party called the Popular Front, centered around communist, as well as Marxist–Leninist ideals. He pledged to continue pursuing the goals of the revolution, but rectify policies which he saw as deviations of its ultimate goal carried out by Thomas Sankara.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burkina Faso 11/01&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In September of 1989, while Compaoré was returning from a two-week trip to Asia, there were rumors of people plotting to overthrow Compaoré’s government. The plotters would be arrested that same day. This event would lead Compaoré to reorganize the young nation&#x27;s government.

In 1990 Compaoré introduced only limited democratic reforms.

In June 1991, Compaoré announced that Burkina Faso was going to adopt a new constitution.

In the 1990s, Compaoré supported rebels in Sierra Leone during the country&#x27;s civil War. The war would kill over 45,000 people and last for 11 years. 

Compaoré was elected as the president of Burkina Faso in 1991, in an election boycotted by the main opposition parties in protest at the questionable means Compaoré had used to take office in the first place. Only 25 percent of the electorate voted. In 1998, Compaoré was re-elected as president.

Between 1998 and 1999, an insurgency took place over reasons with economic violations in Burkina Faso. Many protests, riots, strikes, rallies and marches took place throughout the country and shocked many people. Many protesters even destroyed government properties or houses. Those events at the time were one of the greatest challenges that Compaoré and his administration faced.

=== 2000s ===
Compaoré agreed to meet with United Nations supervised bodies to export weapons after allegations that he and his government has been involved in smuggling arms to rebels in Sierra Leone and Angola. Just a week before that, Blaise Compaoré met with German, France, and with a European Union representative. They discussed their concerns that the country had violated the arms embargo against Sierra Leone and Unita rebels and were being accused of it.

In 2003, numerous alleged plotters were arrested, following accusations of a coup plot against Compaoré. A trial would take place in April 2004 in which they were found guilty. Many sympathizers gathered around the court cheering the plotters for their actions.

In August 2005, he announced his intention to contest the next presidential election. Opposition politicians regarded this as unconstitutional due to a constitutional amendment in 2000 limiting a president to two terms and reducing term lengths from seven to five years. Compaoré&#x27;s supporters disputed this, saying that the amendment could not be applied retroactively, and in October 2005, the constitutional council ruled that because Compaoré was a sitting president in 2000, the amendment would not apply until the end of his second term in office, thereby allowing him to present his candidacy for the 2005 election.

On 13 November 2005, Compaoré was re-elected as president, defeating 12 opponents and winning 80.35 percent of the vote. Although sixteen opposition parties announced a coalition to unseat Compaoré early on in the race, ultimately nobody wanted to give up their spot in the race to another leader in the coalition, and the pact fell through.

Following Compaoré&#x27;s victory, he was sworn in for another term on 20 December 2005.

In 2008 many protests took place because of high living costs and call for wage increases. Compaoré responded by suspending import taxes on products like food for half a year and by increasing commodity for water and electricity.

Spanish Hostages Ransom

Two Spanish aid workers were abducted in November 2009. A hunt was undertaken to find the kidnappers. Just one week before the hostages were freed, Ould Sid Ahmed Ould Hama the kidnapper fled to Mali before he was found and imprisoned for 12 years. It turned out the ransom was paid by Blaise Compaoré, and the hostages were taken to the presidential palace and were given phones. The hostages thanked him for paying the ransom.

=== Final years in power (2010-2014) ===

President Compaoré announced an establishment of a new Senate with 89 members and with 29 of the senators who would be selected by the president themselves while the rest chosen by local politicians.

=== 2011 protests ===
On 14 April 2011, Compaoré was reported to have fled from the capital Ouagadougou to his hometown of Ziniare after mutineering military bodyguards began a revolt in their barracks reportedly over unpaid allowances. Their actions eventually spread to the presidential compound and other army bases. In the night, gunfire was reported at the presidential compound and an ambulance was seen leaving the compound. Soldiers also looted shops in the city through the night.

=== 2014 uprising ===


In June 2014 Compaoré&#x27;s ruling party, the Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP), called on him to organise a referendum that would allow him to alter the constitution in order to seek re-election in 2015. Otherwise, he would be forced to step down due to term limits.

On 30 October 2014, the National Assembly was scheduled to debate an amendment to the constitution that would have enabled Compaoré to stand for re-election as president in 2015. Opponents protested against this by storming the parliament building in Ouagadougou, starting fires inside it and looting offices. Billowing smoke was reported by the BBC to be coming from the building. Opposition spokesman Pargui Emile Paré of the People&#x27;s Movement for Socialism / Federal Party described the protests as &#x27;Burkina Faso&#x27;s black spring (sic), like the Arab spring (sic)&#x27;.

Compaoré reacted to the events by shelving the proposed constitutional changes, dissolving the government, declaring a state of emergency and offering to work with the opposition to resolve the crisis. Later in the day, the military, under General Honore Traore, announced that it would install a transitional government &#x27;in consultation with all parties&#x27; and that the National Assembly was dissolved; he foresaw &#x27;a return to the constitutional order&#x27; within a year. He did not make clear what role, if any, he envisioned for Compaoré during the transitional period. Compaoré said that he was prepared to leave office at the end of the transition.

On 31 October, Compaoré announced he had left the presidency and that there was a &#x27;power vacuum&#x27;. He also called for a &#x27;free and transparent&#x27; election within 90 days. Presidential guard officer Yacouba Isaac Zida then took over as head of state in an interim capacity. It was reported that a heavily-armed convoy believed to be carrying Compaoré was traveling towards the southern town of Pô. However, it diverted before reaching the town and he then fled to Ivory Coast with the support of President Alassane Ouattara.

A week later, &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot; published an interview with Compaoré in which he alleged that &#x27;part of the opposition was working with the army&#x27; to plot his overthrow and that &#x27;history will tell us if they were right&#x27;. He added that he would &#x27;not wish for his worst enemy&#x27; to be in Zida&#x27;s place.

The first head of state that has been in office for more than a short time after Blaise Campaoré is Roch Marc Christian Kaboré as of 29 December 2015.

== Liberian Civil War ==
Compaoré introduced Charles Taylor to his friend Muammar Gaddafi. Compaoré also helped Taylor in the early 1990s by sending him troops and resources.

== International and regional roles ==
In 1993, Compaoré headed the Burkina-Faso delegation that participated in the first Tokyo International Conference on African Development.

Compaoré has been active as a mediator in regional issues. On 26 July 2006, he was designated as the mediator of the Inter-Togolese Dialogue, which was held in Ouagadougou in August 2006 and resulted in an agreement between the government and opposition parties. He has also acted as mediator in the crisis in Ivory Coast, brokering the peace agreement signed by the Ivorian president, Laurent Gbagbo, and the New Forces leader, Guillaume Soro, in Ouagadougou on 4 March 2007. In March 2012, he acted as a mediator in talks between representatives of the Malian coup d&#x27;état and other regional leaders. He hosted talks with them to discuss peace to the conflict.

The BBC noted in 2014 that he was &#x27;the strongest ally to France and the United States in the region&#x27; and that &#x27;despite his own history of backing rebels and fuelling civil wars in the West African neighbourhood ... more importantly, he used his networks to help Western powers battling Islamist militancy in the Sahel&#x27;.

During 2016, the capital was in the grip of a terrorist attack. Jihadists who had suites and tables in town, following agreements with Campaoré of non-aggression. As a result, the military group of the presidential guard received enormous credits while the army was impoverished to avoid any military coup.

He served on the International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber Threats (IMPACT) International Advisory Board.

== Views on sexuality ==
In an interview with the magazine &quot;Famille Chrétienne&quot;, Compaoré asserted that the notion of sexual abstinence was not a monopoly of the Roman Catholic Church and that European non-governmental organizations that disagreed with traditional morality were profiting from the situation to intervene in regional African affairs.

== Indictment ==
In April 2021, a military court in Burkina Faso indicted Compaoré &quot;in absentia&quot;, charging him with the 1987 murder of his immediate predecessor, Thomas Sankara. Another trial against him, on counts of attacking state security, concealing a corpse, and complicity in a murder, began on 11 October 2021. In April 2022, he was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.

==Honors==
** Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit (17 July 2014)
** Grand Cross of the National Order of Mali (August 2013)
** Grand Cordon of the Order of Brilliant Jade (July 1994)

<text>Garmisch-Partenkirchen (Bavarian: &quot;Garmasch-Partakurch&quot;) is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts of Ostallgäu, Weilheim-Schongau and Bad Tölz-Wolfratshausen, and by the Austrian state of Tyrol.

==History==
In medieval times the alpine lands were owned by the bishops of Freising and the abbots of Ettal Abbey. In 1803, when the clerical states of Germany were dissolved, the region was acquired by Bavaria.

==Geography==
The district is located in the Bavarian Alps and includes the highest mountain of Germany, the Zugspitze (2,962 m). The highest peaks are grouped along the Austrian border, where the mountain ridges of the Wettersteingebirge and the Karwendelgebirge rise. Between them the Isar river runs northwards. North of these ridges is a valley housing the tourist resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The valley together with the surrounding mountains is called the Werdenfelser Land. Further north the ridges of the Ammergebirge and the Estergebirge rise, which are still over 2000 m high. In the northernmost parts of the district there is alpine uplands (about 600 m high). Here the Staffelsee is located, a lake of 8 km2.

<text>In law, a minor is someone under a certain age, usually the age of majority, which demarcates an underage individual from legal adulthood. The age of majority depends upon jurisdiction and application, but it is commonly 18. &quot;Minor&quot; may also be used in contexts that are unconnected to the overall age of majority. For example, the smoking and drinking age in the United States is 21, and younger people below this age are sometimes called &quot;minors&quot; in the context of tobacco and alcohol law, even if they are at least 18. The terms underage or &quot;minor&quot; often refer to those under the age of majority, but may also refer to a person under other legal age limits, such as the age of consent, marriageable age, driving age, voting age, working age, etc. Such age limits are often different from the age of majority. 

The concept of &quot;minor&quot; is not sharply defined in most jurisdictions. The age of criminal responsibility, of ability to legally consent to sexual activity, at which school attendance is no longer compulsory and thus a person may leave school, at which legally-binding contracts may be entered into, and so on and so forth, may be different from one another.

In many countries, the age of majority is 18. In the United States, where the age of majority is set by individual states, &quot;minor&quot; usually refers to someone under 18 but can in some areas (such as alcohol, gambling, and handguns) mean under 21. In the criminal justice system a minor may be tried and punished either &quot;as a juvenile&quot; or &quot;as an adult&quot;.

In Taiwan and Thailand, a minor is a person under 20 years of age, and, in South Korea, a person under 19 years of age. In New Zealand, the age of majority is also 20 years of age, but most of the rights of adulthood are assumed at lower ages.

==By country==

===Canada===

For all provincial laws, the provincial and territorial governments have the power to set the age of majority in their respective province or territory, and the age varies across Canada, with some provinces setting the (baseline) age of majority at 18 and others at 19. In some territories a person can emancipate, and assume full responsibility from the age of 16.

In Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and Prince Edward Island the (baseline) age of majority is set at 18, while in British Columbia, Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick the age of majority is 19.

In the provinces of Saskatchewan, Ontario, New Brunswick, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, the legal gambling age and the legal drinking age are both 19, while in Alberta, Quebec, and Manitoba it is 18 which is the age of majority.

Under cannabis laws, a minor means anyone under 19 in the country except for Quebec which has a legal age of 21, and Alberta which is age 18.

===Italy===
In Italy, law nr. 39 of March 8, 1975, states that a minor is a person under the age of 18. Citizens under the age of 18 may not vote, be elected, obtain a driving license for automobiles or issue or sign legal instruments. Crimes committed in Italy by minors are tried in a juvenile court.

===Mexico===
In all 31 states, a minor is referred to as someone under the age of 18.

Minors aged 16 or 17 who are charged with crimes could sometimes be treated as an adult.

===India===
In all 28 states and 8 union territories, a minor is referred to as someone under the age of 18. In rare cases minors aged 16 or 17 who are charged with extremely heinous crimes could sometimes be treated as an adult.

===Thailand===

The Civil and Commercial Code of the Kingdom of Thailand does not define &quot;minor&quot;; however, sections 19 and 20 read as follows:
* Section 19 – A person, on completion of 20 years of age, ceases to be a minor and becomes &quot;sui juris&quot;.
* Section 20 – A minor becomes &quot;sui juris&quot; upon marriage, provided the marriage is made in accordance with the provisions of Section 1448.

Hence, a minor in Thailand refers to any person under the age of 20, unless they are married. A minor is restricted from doing juristic actsfor example, signing contracts. When minors wish to do a juristic act, they have to obtain the consent from their legal representative, usually (but not always) the parents and otherwise the act is voidable. The exceptions are acts by which a minor merely acquires a right or is freed from a duty, acts that are strictly personal, and acts that are suitable to the person&#x27;s condition in life and are required for their reasonable needs. A minor can make a will at the age of fifteen.

===United Kingdom===

In England and Wales, the Family Law Reform Act 1969 set the age of majority in both nations at 18. While in Northern Ireland, the age of majority is set at 18 by the Age of Majority Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 - (which directly corresponds to the former legislation, enacted in England and Wales). In Scotland, the Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991 sets out that the legal age of capacity within the country is 16.

The (minimum) age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland is 10. Sentencing guidelines in these three jurisdictions is often tiered, so that a person who is over the age of criminal responsibility (but not of full age), will receive more lenient treatment depending on how old said person is (so for example, punishment will differ between an offender who is under 12, under 14, or under 16, at the time of a given offence, for example, with harsher punishments being received the higher the age of the offender in question).

In Scotland, the (minimum) age of criminal responsibility is 12.

Things that persons under 18 are prohibited from doing include sitting on a jury, standing as a candidate, buying or renting films with an 18 or R18 classification or seeing them in a cinema, suing without a litigant friend, and purchasing alcohol, or tobacco products.

Driving certain large vehicles, acting as personal license holder for licensed premises, and adopting a child are permitted only upon the age of 21. The minimum age to drive a HGV1 vehicle was reduced to 18. However, certain vehicles, e.g., steamrollers, require that someone be 21 years of age to obtain an operating license.

===United States===
In the United States as of 1971, &quot;minor&quot; is generally legally defined as a person under the age of 18. However, in the context of alcohol or gambling laws (&quot;see legal drinking age and gambling age&quot;), people under the age of 21 may also sometimes be referred to as minors. However, not all minors are considered juveniles in terms of criminal responsibility. As is frequently the case in the United States, the laws vary widely by state.

Under this distinction, those considered juveniles are usually (but not always) tried in juvenile court, and they may be afforded other special protections. For example, in some states a parent or guardian must be present during police questioning, or their names may be kept confidential when they are accused of a crime. For many crimes (especially more violent crimes), the age at which a minor may be tried as an adult is variable below the age of 18 or (less often) below 16.
The death penalty for those who have committed a crime while under the age of 18 was discontinued by the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot; in 2005. The court&#x27;s 5–4 decision was written by Justice Kennedy and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Stevens, Breyer, and Souter, and cited international law, child developmental science, and many other factors in reaching its conclusion.

The twenty-sixth amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1971, granted all citizens the right to vote in every state, in every election, from the age of 18, reducing the minimum ages for most privileges that had previously been set at 21 (signing contracts, marrying without parental consent, termination of legal parental custody) to 18, with the exception of drinking, which had been raised to 21 around the 1980s due to teen drunk driving cases protested by the Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
The U.S. Department of Defense took the position that they would not consider &quot;enemy combatants&quot; held in extrajudicial detention in the Guantanamo Bay detainment camps minors unless they were less than sixteen years old. In any event, they separated only three of more than a dozen detainees under 16 from the adult prison population. Several dozen detainees between sixteen and eighteen were detained with the adult prison population. Now those under 18 are kept separate, in line with the age of majority and world expectations.

Some states, including Florida, have passed laws that allow a person accused of certain crimes, such as murder, to be tried as an adult, regardless of age. These laws have been challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union. An estimated 250,000 youth are tried, sentenced, or incarcerated as adults every year across the United States.

==Emancipation of minors==

Emancipation of minors is a legal mechanism by which a minor is no longer under the control of their parents or guardians, and is given the legal rights associated with adults. Depending on country, emancipation may happen in different manners: through marriage, attaining economic self-sufficiency, obtaining an educational degree or diploma, or participating in a form of military service. In the United States, all states have some form of emancipation of minors.

<doc id="289516" wikidata="Q4944818" url="?curid=289516" title="Bored Suburban Youth">
<text>Bored Suburban Youth (also known as BSY and Bored Suburban Youths, in the plural rather than collective form) was among the hardcore punk bands that rose up in the Southeastern United States in the &quot;second wave&quot; of the 1980s. Along with bands such as Bedlam Hour, Massappeal and The Sex Mutants, BSY contributed to the nascent punk scene in the decidedly un-punk environs of the politically and socially conservative New South.

Inspired by an early 1980s Black Flag show, Bored Suburban Youth was formed by a group of students at Irmo High School in the suburbs of Columbia, South Carolina. The original lineup consisted of John Hathaway (guitar), Troy Tague (drums) and Shannon Burgess (bass). An early lineup featured John Dickerson on vocals, but he was soon replaced by Darren Walker, who fronted BSY for nearly all of the band&#x27;s four-year run. BSY&#x27;s sound was characterized as having &quot;buzz saw guitars&quot; and &quot;aggressive vocals,&quot; though the band themselves referred to their sound as simply &quot;rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll.&quot;

The longest-lived BSY lineup was Hathaway, Tague, Walker, Steve Sonic (guitar) and Brian Molin (bass). The band&#x27;s work of this era is best captured in the &quot;Live at the Drama Lab&quot; recordings; another recording featuring this lineup appears on the compilation lp &quot;Method To Our Madness&quot; issued by Phantom Records in 1986. Sonic joined BSY after the disintegration of seminal Orangeburg, South Carolina punk band Red Menace, which had blazed trails of its own in the early 1980s. Later lineups of BSY would feature two other former members of Red Menace: Kenny &quot;Jolt&quot; Gillam (drums) and Carl Van Sewell (bass).

Like many punk bands of the time, BSY burned out in a few years, but they made a lasting impact on the Southeastern US punk scene by building up a loyal grassroots following and embracing all-ages venues in the region. To this end, BSY would play anytime, anywhere. This DIY ethic led to shows in barns, lodges, galleries, record shops and even high school theatres.

An 8-song 7-inch record posthumously released under the name &quot;Red Menace: Farewell Suburbia&quot; marked the end of the band in 1988, but BSY&#x27;s missionary dedication to the punk ethic gave rise to a vibrant alternative music scene in South Carolina and spawned other original bands spanning many musical genres. In 2014, former BSY drummer Kenny Jolt created a video of the 1988 song &quot;Police State&quot; and posted it on YouTube.

<doc id="289530" wikidata="Q2283083" url="?curid=289530" title="Victor's justice">
<text>Victor&#x27;s justice is a pejorative term which is used in reference to a distorted application of justice to the defeated party by the victorious party after an armed conflict. Victor&#x27;s justice generally involves the excessive or unjustified punishment of defeated parties and the light punishment of or clemency for offenses which have been committed by victors. Victors&#x27; justice can be used in reference to manifestations of a difference in rules which can amount to hypocrisy and revenge or retributive justice leading to injustice. Victors&#x27; justice may also refer to a misrepresentation of historical recording of the events and actions of the losing party throughout or preceding the conflict.

The English term &quot;victors&#x27; justice&quot; was first used by history professor Richard Minear in his 1971 account of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, and is typically (but not always) applied to the aftermath of warfare. It may be a loan translation of synonymous German , which is attested since at least the 1960s. The closely related term &quot;Vae victis behaviour&quot; is where a victor unilaterally changes the agreed treaties or their interpretations and is seen as a form of victor&#x27;s justice.

== History of the laws of war ==
Legal constraints on the conduct of war in Ancient Rome appear in Cicero: &quot;As for war, humane laws touching it are drawn up in the fetial code of the Roman People.&quot; Specifically, &quot;no war is just, unless it is entered upon after an official demand for satisfaction has been submitted or warning has been given and a formal declaration made.&quot; Breaches of this duty by Roman citizens were adjudicated at trial. But to enemies of war, Roman law attributed neither duties nor rights; hence judgment – and punishment – of defeated foes was at Roman discretion. Still, the exercise of that discretion must serve justice, Cicero argued: &quot;...when the victory is won, we should spare those who have not been blood-thirsty and barbarous in their warfare&quot; (warmaking being excused only when &quot;we may live in peace unharmed&quot; in no other way).

The Western tradition of thinking on just war continues into Christendom and then modernity, and from the late 19th century becomes codified in international conventions, most notably those of Geneva and the Hague, then said to express laws of war.

== Allegations ==
Victor&#x27;s justice is alleged to have occurred throughout history.

A well-known ancient example is the Siege of Plataea in 429–427 BC, during the Peloponnesian War. The town of Plataea, a staunch ally of Athens, steadfastly endured a prolonged siege by the Spartans and their allies, finally surrendering to the Spartans when all supplies they had were exhausted and no hope of relief remained. They had trusted the Spartans to a fair trial, as the Spartans had promised to &quot;judge them all fairly&quot;, and that &quot;only the guilty should be punished&quot; if they yielded. Yet, when the Plataean prisoners were brought before the judges, no trial was held and they could offer no real defense. The Spartans simply asked each of the prisoners if they had done the Spartans and allies any service in the war, to which the prisoners ultimately had no choice but to answer &quot;no&quot;. It was well known to anybody involved that during the entire war the Plataeans had fought on the Athenian side, against the Spartans, that being the duly declared policy of their city-state. Upon the Plataeans giving that negative answer, they were put to death one by one – over 200 of them. Thucydides clearly considered this an unfair judicial procedure.

Documented allegations of victor&#x27;s justice became especially prevalent since the 19th century.

James Madison Page, a veteran of the Union Army during the American Civil War, presented a stark and detailed example of victor&#x27;s justice in his 1908 book &quot;The True Story of Andersonville Prison&quot;, subtitled &quot;A Defense of Major Henry Wirz&quot;. After describing his months as a prisoner of war of the Confederacy, Page recounts the imprisonment and trial of Major Henry Wirz, the only commandant of Camp Sumter prisoner of war camp near Andersonville, Georgia. The Confederacy held approximately 45,000 Union prisoners at Camp Sumter from February 1864 to April 1865, during which nearly 13,000 died due to the prison&#x27;s horrific conditions. Wirz became known as &quot;The Demon of Andersonville&quot; in the victorious Union, and was one of only two Confederates convicted of war crimes for their actions during the American Civil War. Wirz was found guilty by a war crimes tribunal and publicly executed in Washington, D.C., on November 10, 1865. Some have questioned the charges against Wirz, his personal responsibility for the conditions at Camp Sumter, and the fairness of his post-war trial. In 1980, historian Morgan D. Peoples referred to Wirz as a &quot;scapegoat&quot; and his conviction remains controversial.

The war crimes trials following World War II were later observed to feature many of the phenomena and issues seen in Page&#x27;s account of Wirz&#x27;s trial, conviction, sentencing, and execution. The Nuremberg Criminal Court for war crimes (and subsidiary courts like the Dachau International Military Tribunal) prosecuted only Axis nationals or collaborators for war crimes and did not prosecute Allied war crimes.
By the mid-twentieth century, the armed forces of developed nations commonly issued their soldiers detailed written guidance on the customs and international treaty obligations that comprise the laws of war. For example, at the trial of SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Otto Skorzeny, his defense was based in part on the Field Manual published by the War Department of the United States Army in 1940, as well as on the &quot;American Soldiers&#x27; Handbook&quot;. Prosecution for war crimes therefore normally falls under the jurisdiction of the courts-martial of an offender&#x27;s own military. When members of the Allied armed forces broke their military codes, they could face charges, as for example the Dachau massacre or the Biscari massacre trials. The unconditional surrender of the Axis powers was unusual and led directly to the formation of the international tribunals. International wars usually end conditionally, and the treatment of suspected war criminals makes up part of the peace treaty. In most cases those who are not prisoners of war are tried under their own judicial systems if they are suspected of committing war crimes, as happened at the end of WWII in Finland, when the Allied Control Commission provided a list of occurrences of war crimes and crimes against peace, and the investigation and judgment of these cases were left to Finnish courts according to Finnish law. However, an &quot;ex post facto&quot; law had to be instated for those cases, as the Finnish Criminal Act did not cover responsibility for politics resulting in a war. In restricting the international tribunal to trying suspected Axis war crimes, the Allies were acting within normal international law.

The Reunification of Germany in October 1990 saw the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) to form the modern unified country of Germany. Reunification saw numerous East German officials charged with crimes by German courts that were direct continuations of West German courts, which some considered to be victor&#x27;s justice. Many low-ranking members of the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic were charged with crimes related to , with an estimated 300 to 400 deaths at the Berlin Wall and Inner German border. These border guards, known as (&quot;death shooters&quot;), were often convicted despite arguing they were following (&quot;order to fire&quot;) from superiors which instructed guards to shoot escapees that ignored two warnings to stop. The German courts argued East German border laws were so fundamentally in conflict with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which East Germany had signed and ratified, that they were not law at all but formalized injustice, and thus the soldiers ought to have disobeyed their commanding officers.

== Attempts to ensure the fairness of war crimes prosecutions ==
Since World War II, the accusation of victor&#x27;s justice has arisen in every subsequent conflict where war crimes prosecutions have been made. Examples of include the Yugoslav wars, the Rwandan genocide, and the war in Afghanistan.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) was set up in 2003 as a treaty arrangement between member states in an attempt to provide a neutral international court that avoids the accusation of &quot;victor&#x27;s justice&quot;, and that would prosecute all alleged war crimes, on either side of any conflict.

== Current allegations ==
* The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), organized by the United Nations claims jurisdiction over all acts of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes within the territory of former Yugoslavia. But so far the Tribunal has prosecuted only citizens from the Balkan states. Most defendants have been Serb politicians, soldiers and paramilitaries but Croats, Bosnians and ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas have also been tried. However, the Tribunal has declined to investigate allegations made by Western academics and Serb politicians, who accused NATO officials of war crimes during the 1999 bombing of Serbia (the Kosovo War), including the deliberate bombing of a Serb TV station killing journalists, and the lethal bombing (possibly reckless) of a railway bridge whilst a civilian train was passing over it.
* The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), organized by the United Nations claims jurisdiction over all acts of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes within the territory of Rwanda. However, while the Tribunal has successfully prosecuted members of the former Hutu government for their crimes, it has largely failed to prosecute war crimes committed by the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front, leading it to be accused of victor&#x27;s justice.

<doc id="289540" wikidata="Q4385090" url="?curid=289540" title="Bottle cage">
<text>A bottle cage is a device used to affix a water bottle to a bicycle. Composed of plastic, aluminum, stainless steel, titanium or carbon fiber, it is attached to the main frame of a bicycle, the handlebars, behind the saddle, or, in uncommon cases, the fork. Most modern bicycles have threaded holes in the frame to hold the bottle cage, often called braze-ons even though they may be welded, glued, riveted, or moulded into the frame material. Clamps are necessary on bicycles not so equipped, such as older or less expensive models.

==Locations==
The most common location for a frame-mounted bottle cage is on the top side of the downtube.
The most common location for a second frame-mounted bottle cage is on the front side of the seat tube.
Small bikes and mountain bikes with rear suspension often do not have enough room for two bottle cages inside the main frame triangle. Some mountain bikes have highly sloped top tubes that limit the size of bottles mounted inside the triangle.

Some touring bicycles have a third frame mounting location: under the downtube.

Bottle cages may be mounted behind the seat with a bracket that attaches to the seatpost.

Some uncommon forks include bottle cage mounts.

Tandem bicycles may have as many as six bottle cages.

Recumbent bicycles may have bottle cages mounted to the steering mechanism or behind the seat back.

==Styles==
The vast majority of bottle cages consist of a single hoop of metal tubing or rod bent to hold the bottle snugly and engage the neck, or an indentation in the case of larger bottles, to prevent it from bouncing out.

Varieties, often made out of plastic or carbon fiber, may completely encircle the bottle.

Some manufacturers have released non-standard bottles and cages that only work with each other in order to offer specialized shapes (streamlined, for example) or restrict consumers from purchasing brand-specific items.

==Standards==
===Mounting points===
The standard bottle cage has two mounting holes, apart, to match the threaded holes in the frame, and through which small bolts pass. Some have a strap, adjustable for non standard bottles. A fork might include bottle mounts as well. If equipped a 3 hole configuration is normally used to allow the cage to be mounted higher or lower on the fork. The holes are usually sized and threaded to accept an M5 × 0.8 bolt, which means standard coarse metric threads with 5 mm in diameter and 0.8 mm pitch.

===Bottle===
The standard size bottle cage holds a bottle 73 mm in diameter and 127 mm tall (2-7/8 inches or 2.875″ diameter and five inches long), or bottles in other lengths with an indentation that far from the bottom for the tab on the cage to engage.

==Other uses==
Some examples of bicycle lighting take advantage of the bottle cage by using it to hold a bottle-shaped battery to power the lights. This sort of bicycle lighting has proved popular.

Many small tire pumps come with a mounting bracket intended to be mounted alongside a bottle cage.

The Trek Soho 3.0 comes with a stainless steel coffee mug designed to fit in the bottle cage mounted on the front side of the seat tube.

In addition to the fairly standard cycling water bottle, cages have been produced to hold commercial 1 liter and 1.5 liter water bottles.

==History==
Until the 1960s, cyclists often carried a second bottle on the handlebars, held by a bottle cage fixed to the handlebars themselves and by a third point to the handlebar stem. Such bottle cages are familiar from pictures of the Tour de France. Riders had a cage there rather than have two on the frame, where the centre of gravity is lower, because at the time the Tour&#x27;s rules insisted that riders carry a pump. The pump took up the length of one frame tube and made a second bottle cage on the frame impossible.

<text>Raymond Mphakamisi Mhlaba OMSG (12 February 1920 – 20 February 2005) was an anti-apartheid activist, Communist and leader of the African National Congress (ANC) also as well the first premier of the Eastern Cape. Mhlaba spent 25 years of his life in prison. Well known for being sentenced, along with Nelson Mandela, Govan Mbeki, Walter Sisulu and others in the Rivonia Trial, he was an active member of the ANC and the South African Communist Party (SACP) all his adult life. His kindly manner brought him the nickname &quot;Oom Ray&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Mhlaba was born in Mazoka village in the Fort Beaufort district, Eastern Cape and was educated at Healdtown Mission Institute but had to drop out because of financial problems Mhlaba started working at a laundry in Port Elizabeth after leaving school in 1942. He met and married his first wife, Joyce Meke, who was also from the Fort Beaufort area in 1943. In their 17 years together, before her death in a car accident in 1960, they had three children Bukeka, Nomalungelo and Jongintshaba. In 1982, Mhlaba, who had been a political prisoner in Robben Island since 1964, was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison where he received special permission marry his common-law wife Dideka Heliso in 1986, with whom he had three children Mpilo, Nomawethu and Nikiwe.

==Early political career==

Mhlaba started working at a laundry in Port Elizabeth after leaving school in 1942. The horrendous conditions at the laundry converted him to a trade unionist and he became the leader of Non European Laundry Workers Union in 1943. In 1943, he joined the South African Communist Party, serving as the party&#x27;s district secretary from 1946 until the party was banned in 1950. In 1944, he became a member of the African National Congress. From 1944 Mhlaba maintained dual membership of the ANC and the SACP. He rose through the ANC ranks becoming the chairman of the Port Elizabeth branch of the ANC from 1947 to 1953, and then elected to the Cape Executive committee. Mhlaba was the first to be arrested for disobeying apartheid laws during the nationwide Defiance Campaign of 1952 together with Govan Mbeki and Vuyisile Mini for three months in &quot;Rooi Hel&quot; (&#x27;Red Hell&#x27; or North End Prison, Port Elizabeth). The campaign was launched in Port Elizabeth when Mhlaba led a group of volunteers singing freedom songs through the &quot;Whites Only&quot; entrance of the New Brighton Railway Station. This action earned him the Xhosa nickname &quot;Vulindlela&quot; or &quot;he who opens the way.&quot; That same year, Mhlaba was charged under South Africa&#x27;s Suppression of Communism Act. Although his political activities continued, he was barred from attending meetings or gatherings.
After the ANC was banned on 8 April under the Unlawful Organisations Act, the party took up the armed struggle forming its military wing Umkhonto we Sizwe. Mhlaba was one of its first recruits and was sent to China for military training. Before leaving he assisted Mandela in writing the Umkhonto constitution. In 1962, Mhlaba returned to South Africa, becoming a commander of the MK after Nelson Mandela&#x27;s arrest.

==Rivonia Trial==

On 11 July 1963 the South African apartheid government raided the ANC&#x27;s underground headquarters in Rivonia, north of Johannesburg. Mhlaba and 10 other ANC and SACP leaders including Ahmed Kathrada, Walter Sisulu and Govan Mbeki were arrested and Nelson Mandela was already in prison. They were charged with
sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government.
On 9 October 1963, the world-famous Rivonia Trial with all the accused charged with high treason. On 12 June 1964, Mhlaba, Mandela and seven other ANC leaders were sentenced to life imprisonment, and all were sent to Robben Island but the white Denis Goldberg was sent to Pretoria Central Prison instead of Robben Island.

==Struggle from prison==

During his time in Robben Island, Mhlaba and other ANC members founded the ANC High Command or High Organ with Mandela as its head. The committee educated and supported younger imprisoned members, formulated policies on day-to-day concerns, prisoners&#x27; complaints, and strikes, and enforced discipline within their isolation unit. Looking back at their time in Robben Island Mandela said of Mhlaba: &quot;I got to know him as the peacemaker. He spent a lot of time urging fellow prisoners to forget their differences and unite so that conditions for prisoners could improve.&quot;

==Release from prison==
After his release from prison on 15 October 1989, he was elected to the ANC national executive and the South African Communist Party central committee. He became national chairperson of the SACP in 1995.

In January 1994 he was chosen as the ANC&#x27;s nominee as Premier of the Eastern Cape, and in May 1994 he was elected to that post. He helped to establish the house of traditional leaders. He then became the High Commissioner to Uganda and Rwanda, until he retired in 2001. In April 2001 he released a book of his memoirs, narrated by him and researched and compiled by Thembeka Mafumadi.
He was chairperson of a black economic empowerment consortium involved in the Coega port project, but suffered a stroke on 19 July 2003, recovering quickly.

==Death==
In 2004, Mhlaba was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer, and in December doctors discharged him from a private clinic saying there was nothing they could do for him. On 20 February 2005 he died in hospital. He was granted state funeral on 27 February 2005. Mhlaba is survived by his three sons and five daughters, his wife Dideka Mhlaba having died on 18 January 2010.

==Legacy==

Mhlaba is seen as a stalwart member of both the ANC and the SACP. He was recognised with the Isitwalandwe Medal in 1992 for his role in the liberation struggle, and the Moses Kotane Award in 2002 for his contribution to the SACP. The Nkonkobe Local Municipality which includes Alice and Mhlaba&#x27;s hometown Fort Beaufort was renamed the Raymond Mhlaba Local Municipality and Andries Pretorius street, The R30 in Bloemfontein was renamed after Raymond Mhlaba to honour him.
There&#x27;s an ANC branch named after him in Mpumalanga, Nkangala region, sub-region Thembisile Hani ward 11 in Verena.

<doc id="289566" wikidata="Q1380079" url="?curid=289566" title="William Colgate">
<text>William Colgate (January 25, 1783 – March 25, 1857) was an English-American industrialist who in 1806 founded what became the Colgate-Palmolive company.

==Early life==
William Colgate was born in Hollingbourne, Kent, England, on January 25, 1783, He was the son of Robert Colgate (1758–1826), a farmer and politician, and his wife Sarah (née Bowles). The family moved to a farm near Shoreham when William was six years old.

His father was a sympathizer with both the American and French Revolutions, whose republican ideals impelled him to leave their farm in March 1798 and emigrate to Baltimore, Maryland, in the United States of America, after which the family settled on a farm in Harford County. Robert formed a partnership with Ralph Maher to manufacture soap and candles, and teenage William helped out, but the partnership dissolved after two years. The family later settled in Delaware County, New York.

== Career ==
William Colgate went to New York City in 1804 and began work as an apprentice in a soap-boiler. Observing what he regarded as mismanagement, he learned valuable lessons to apply to a business of his own. At the close of his apprenticeship he wrote to dealers in other cities seeking to establish himself with them. In 1806 William set up a starch, soap and candle business on Dutch Street in Manhattan. In 1820, he opened a starch factory across the Hudson in Jersey City. He went on to become one of the most prosperous men in New York City, sought for his wise counsel and ready to offer aid to others in practical enterprises. Through this he gained wide influence, especially among those of his faith.

==Personal life==

The Rev. William Parkinson, pastor of the First Baptist Church in the City of New York, baptized the twenty-three year-old Colgate in February 1808, who then became a deacon. In 1811 he moved to Oliver Street Baptist Church. In 1838 he became a member of the Tabernacle Baptist Church, to the erection of which he had himself largely contributed.

Colgate was a tither to his faith throughout his long and successful business career.

===Family===
Colgate married Mary Gilbert (1788-1855) on April 23, 1810, and they had nine children: Robert (1812-1885), Gilbert (1814-1838), Sarah (1816-1859), James (1818-1904), William III (1820-1838), Samuel (1822-1897), Mary IV (1826-1873), Joseph (1828-1865), and Martha (1831-1837). His son Robert purchased Stonehurst at Riverdale-on-Hudson in the Bronx about 1859 shortly after it was built; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Robert&#x27;s son, Romulus Riggs Colgate, built the Colgate Mansion in Sharon, Connecticut.

==Philanthropy==
Colgate annually subscribed money to assist in defraying the expenses of Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution (later Madison University and Theological Seminary); and he was among the most strenuous opponents of their removal to the city of Rochester. His sons James and Samuel were both benefactors of Madison University and Theological Seminary. After seven decades of the Colgates&#x27; involvement, the school was renamed Colgate University in 1890.

Colgate was a regular contributor to the funds of the Baptist Missionary Union, and took upon himself the entire support of a foreign missionary.

<doc id="289567" wikidata="Q695703" url="?curid=289567" title="BMW Dixi">
<text>Dixi is a brand name of cars made by originally by Automobilwerk Eisenach, later by BMW. The first Dixi car was produced in 1904. In the difficult economic climate of the 1920s the company found it hard to sell its 6/24 and 9/40 models. So the manufacturer decided to enter the small car market, and in 1927 signed a licensing agreement with the Austin Motor Company to build a variant of the Austin 7. A production level of 2000 cars a year was agreed upon, and Dixi paid Austin a royalty on each vehicle produced.

The first 100 cars were supplied by Austin as kits, but by December 1927 the first of the official Dixi-manufactured vehicles, the DA-1 3/15PS were coming off the production line. The DA designation stood for Deutsche Ausführung, meaning German Version; 3/15 indicated the taxation and actual horsepower ratings. Apart from being left-hand drive and using metric fasteners, the car was nearly identical to the Austin. Body styles available were coupé, roadster, tourer, and sedan with a few chassis going to external coachbuilders. Most cars left the factory as tourers. 

Looking to move into automobile manufacturing, BMW bought the Automobilwerk Eisenach in 1928 and, with it, the rights to build the Dixi car. At first the cars were badged as BMW Dixi but the Dixi name was dropped in 1929 when the DA-1 was replaced by a slightly updated version, the BMW 3/15 DA-2.

<doc id="289568" wikidata="Q4239467" url="?curid=289568" title="Red Clydeside">
<text>Red Clydeside was the era of political radicalism in Glasgow, Scotland, from the 1910s until the early 1930s. It also referred to the areas around the city on the banks of the River Clyde, such as Clydebank, Greenock, Dumbarton and Paisley. Red Clydeside is a significant part of the history of the labour movement in Scotland, and in Britain as a whole.

Some newspapers of the time used the term &#x27;Red Clydeside&#x27; in derogatory terms, to refer to the groundswell of popular and political radicalism that had erupted in Scotland. A confluence of charismatic individuals, organised movements, and socio-political forces gave rise to Red Clydeside, which had its roots in working-class opposition to Britain&#x27;s participation in the First World War. The region had a long history of political radicalism going back to the Society of the Friends of the People and the &quot;Radical War&quot; of 1820.

== 1911 strike at Singer ==
The 11,000 workers at the largest Singer sewing machines factory in Clydebank went on strike in March–April 1911, ceasing to work in solidarity with 12 female colleagues protesting against work process reorganisation. This reorganisation involved an increase in workload, and a decrease in wages. Following the end of the strike, Singer fired 400 workers, including Jane Rae one of the women activists, and all strike leaders and purported members of the Industrial Workers of Great Britain, among them Arthur McManus, who later went on to become the first chairman of the Communist Party of Great Britain between 1920 and 1922.

Labour unrest, in particular by women and unskilled labourers, greatly increased between 1910 and 1914 in Clydeside, with four times more days on strike than between 1900 and 1910. During these four years preceding World War I, membership of those affiliated to the Scottish Trades Union Congress rose from 129,000 in 1909 to 230,000 in 1914.

== Anti-war activism ==

To mobilise the workers of Clydeside against the First World War, the Clyde Workers&#x27; Committee (CWC) was formed, with Willie Gallacher as its head and David Kirkwood its treasurer. The CWC led the campaign against the coalition governments of H. H. Asquith and David Lloyd George and the Munitions of War Act 1915, which forbade engineers leaving the company they were employed in. The CWC met with government leaders, but no agreement could be reached and consequently both Gallacher and Kirkwood were arrested under the terms of the Defence of the Realm Act, and jailed for their activities.

Anti-war activity also took place outside the workplace and on the streets in general. The Marxist John Maclean and the Independent Labour Party (ILP) member James Maxton were both jailed for their anti-war propagandizing.

Helen Crawfurd was opposed to conscription and, although there were anti-war and anti-conscription campaigns in organisations such as the WIL being organised and run by middle-class women, few working-class women were involved in Scotland. Frustration on her part on their lack of representation, Helen Crawfurd organised a grassroots meeting called &#x27;The Great Women&#x27;s Peace Conference&#x27; involving socialist-minded women in June 1916. From this meeting, and alongside her fellow Rent Striker Agnes Dollan, The Women&#x27;s Peace Crusade (WPC) arose in November 1916 in Govan, Glasgow. As intended, the organisation initially attracted working-class women in Govan to activism, and with open air meetings throughout Glasgow, Edinburgh and within Lowland Scotland they began to extend their reach. By 1917, street meetings were regularly being held all around the districts of Glasgow and beyond, including Partick, Maryhill, Bridgeton, Parkhead, Govan, Govanhill, Whiteinch, Shettleston, Springburn, Possilpark, Bellahouston, Rutherglen, Paisley, Overnewton Barrhead, Cambuslang, Blantyre, Alloa, Cowdenbeath, Drongan, Drumpark, Douglas Water and Lanark. As a further indicator of their success, a mass demonstration was organised by the WPC on Sunday 8 July 1917, in which processions marched to the sound of music and the flying of banners from two sides of the city to the famous Glasgow Green in the centre of the city. As the two streams of Crusaders approached the green they merged into a huge colourful and noisy demonstration of around 14,000 participants.

By the time that the Peace Crusade disbanded it had become a UK-wide organisation.

== Rent strikes ==
At the turn of the twentieth century, the Clydeside area in Glasgow experienced rapid industrial and population growth during which time Glasgow became Scotland&#x27;s largest city, as its population grew from almost 200,000 in 1851 to over 1,000,000 in 1921. Despite this exponential growth, housing remained a huge problem for its inhabitants as few houses were added to Glasgow&#x27;s housing stock to accommodate the influx of immigrants from all over Scotland, other areas of Britain and Europe. Eleven percent of Glasgow&#x27;s housing stock was vacant due to speculation and few new houses were built as landlords benefited from renting out overcrowded and increasingly dilapidated flats. As Highlanders and Irish migrants came to Glasgow, the city&#x27;s population increased by 65,000 people between 1912 and 1915 while only 1,500 new housing units were built. Glaswegian activists had demanded legislation and the building of municipal housing as early as 1885, when the Royal Commission on Housing and the Working Class noted the housing crisis. The Scottish Housing Council organised in 1900 and under pressure from trade unions the Housing Letting and Rating Act 1911 was passed. The act introduced letting by month, previously workers with unstable jobs had been forced to put up a year&#x27;s rent payment. But as landlords increased rents protests by tenants became more frequent.

John Maclean of the British Socialist Party organised the Scottish Federation of Tenants&#x27; Associations in 1913 to fight against rent increases and championed public housing. In 1914 the Independent Labour Party Housing Committee and the Women&#x27;s Labour League formed the Glasgow Women&#x27;s Housing Association. Under the leadership of Mary Barbour, Mary Laird, Helen Crawfurd, Mary Jeff, Jessie Stephen and Jessie Fergusson the Glasgow Women&#x27;s Housing Association became the driving force behind the rent strike that started in May 1915 in the industrialised area of Govan. Tenants refused to pay the latest increase in rents and staged mass demonstrations against evictions, resulting in violent confrontations. With the start of the First World War local young men left Glasgow to serve in the army overseas, and the first violent protest in the Govan district took place in April to resist the eviction of a soldier&#x27;s family. As evictions were repeatedly attempted with support from the police, women attacked the factors and the sheriffs&#x27; men.

In early summer 1915, the rent strikers were supported by mass demonstrations and by August, the rent strikers had found widespread support in Glasgow. Rent strikes spread from heavily industrialised areas of the city to artisanal areas and slum areas. Strikes ignited in Partick, Parkhead, Pollokshaws, Pollok, Cowcaddens, Kelvingrove, Ibrox, Govanhill, St Rollox, Townhead, Springburn, Maryhill, Fairfield, Blackfriars, and Woodside. In October 1915, 15,000 tenants were on rent strike and a demonstration led by women converged on St Enoch Square. By November, 20,000 tenants were on rent strike as violent resistance against evictions continued. Trade unions threatened factory strikes if evictions supported by the police continued and following demonstrations on 17 November, legal action against rent strikers was halted. State Secretary of Scotland Thomas McKinnon Wood asked the Cabinet to freeze all rents at pre-war levels and in December, the Rents and Mortgage Interest Restriction Act 1915 received royal assent.

In March 2018, to mark International Women&#x27;s Day, a bronze sculpture of Barbour was unveiled in Govan, Glasgow portraying Barbour leading a line of strikers.

== The 40 Hour Strike ==

The left-wing activities continued after the end of the war. The campaign for a 40-hour week, with improved conditions for the workers, occupied the exertions of organised labour. On 31 January 1919, a massive rally, organised by the trade unions, took place on George Square in the city centre of Glasgow. Although it has been claimed that as many as 90,000 people were present, contemporary sources suggest 20-25,000. Once again, although it is claimed that the Red Flag was raised in the centre of the crowd, this had in reality happened on Monday 27 January. The failure of the tram drivers to join the strike had led to growing hostility, and some of the strikers tried to block the tram traffic in the Square. Police attempts to clear the way led to violence and a series of baton charges. The Riot Act was read, and attacks were made on strike leader David Kirkwood as he exited the City Chambers.

The Sheriff of Lanarkshire, who had earlier checked that troops would be available if he needed them, called for military aid. Mainly Scottish and mainly veteran troops were sent from bases elsewhere in Scotland, and one battalion was sent up from the north of England. Claims that the troops were sent by the government, as well as claims that Scottish troops were locked in their barracks during the incident, are part of the extensive mythology surrounding the event. It was only fourteen months since the Russian Revolution, and the German Revolution was still in progress in January 1919. The troops started arriving at 10 pm that evening, after the violence was over. Six tanks arrived from Dorset on Monday, 3 February. 

== Debate about it being a &quot;revolutionary moment&quot; ==
There remains a debate on the left, over whether the Red Clydeside movement constituted a revolutionary opportunity for the working-class, though on the face of it, it would appear that the revolutionary potential of the Clydeside working-class has been exaggerated. Firstly, except Maclean, none of the labour leaders developed a class analysis of the war, nor did they seriously consider threatening the power and authority of the state. Furthermore, it was the behaviour of those conducting the war, not the war itself that provoked opposition within the labour movement. The Independent Labour Party&#x27;s May Day Manifesto of 1918 makes this very clear in calling for &quot;A Living Wage for all&quot; and &quot;Justice for our Soldiers and their Dependants&quot;. Moreover, the massive demand for men to fight in the war meant that few Glaswegian families escaped personal loss of some kind. To undermine the war effort was to risk alienating the working-class, which many labour leaders were unwilling to do-–apart from Maxton, Gallacher and Maclean.

William Gallacher, who would later become a Communist MP claimed that, whilst the leaders of the rally were not seeking revolution, in hindsight they should have been. He claimed that they should have marched to the Maryhill Barracks and tried to persuade the troops stationed there to come out on the protesters&#x27; side.

The trade union leaders, who had organised the meeting, were arrested. Most were acquitted, although both Gallacher and Manny Shinwell were put in jail for their activities that day, Shinwell also being charged with an inflammatory speech the week before in James Watt Street in the city&#x27;s docks, in an episode that later erupted into a race riot.

== &quot;Reds&quot; in Parliament ==

The aura of &quot;Red Clydeside&quot; grew as delegations of organised labour replaced the Liberal Party as the political formation most popular among the working class. This manifested itself at the 1922 general election, when several of the &quot;Red Clydesiders&quot; were elected to serve in the House of Commons (most of them Independent Labour Party members). They included Maxton, Wheatley, Shinwell, Kirkwood, Neil Maclean and George Buchanan.

According to the Labour Party, the &quot;Red Clydesiders&quot; were viewed as having a dissident left-wing character. Many of them, most notably Maxton and Wheatley, were great critics of the first and second Labour governments, elected in 1924 and 1929 respectively.

The &quot;Red Clydeside&quot; era still impacts upon the politics of the area today. Ever since, Glasgow has been known for political and industrial militancy. The Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Work In of 1971 offers a pertinent example. The Labour Party has been historically dominant in Glasgow where they held the vast majority of parliamentary seats until SNP gains in 2015 from where they held all seats (with the exception of Glasgow North East between 2017-2019) until their return to Labour in 2024.

This period in Glasgow&#x27;s colourful past remains a significant landmark for those on the political left in Scotland. The story of the &quot;Red Clydesiders&quot; can still be politically motivating. At the 1989 Glasgow Central by-election, the Scottish National Party candidate Alex Neil called himself and the SNP member of Parliament for Govan at the time, Jim Sillars; the &quot;new Clydesiders&quot;.

== Popular culture ==
The album &quot;Red Clydeside&quot; by Alistair Hulett and Dave Swarbrick contains nine songs about the movement, particularly the anti-war protests and the rent strike. The Red Clydeside movement was also featured in John McGrath&#x27;s play &quot;Little Red Hen&quot;, performed by 7:84.

<text>Belmont University is a private Christian university in Nashville, Tennessee. Descended from Belmont Women&#x27;s College, founded in 1890 by schoolteachers Ida Hood and Susan Heron, the institution was incorporated in 1951 as Belmont College. 

With expansion of programs, it became Belmont University in 1991. Belmont&#x27;s current enrollment consists of approximately 8,900 students representing every state and 28 nations. Although the university cut its ties with the Tennessee Baptist Convention in 2007, it continues to emphasize a Christian identity.

==History==

The university originated with the founding of the Belmont Women&#x27;s College in 1890 by Susan Ledley Heron and Ida Emily Hood, on the site of the Belmont Mansion, built by Joseph Acklen and Adelicia (Hayes) Acklen. 

Upon the retirement of Heron and Hood, Belmont Women&#x27;s College merged with Ward Seminary in 1913 and was known as Ward—Belmont College, which included both a junior college and college-prep (or high) school for women. The Belmont Mansion is owned by Belmont University but maintained by the Belmont Mansion Association, a non-profit group. The mansion is open for tours. It features Victorian art and furnishings. The water tower, gardens, with surviving gazebos and outdoor statuary from the Acklen era, are part of the college campus. In 1991, the school became Belmont University.

The university was awarded the Japanese Foreign Minister&#x27;s Commendation for their contributions to the promotion of mutual understanding between Japan and the US on December 1, 2020.

===Nashville&#x27;s first radio station===

The first radio station in Nashville went on air in May 1922 when Boy Scout 
John &quot;Jack&quot; DeWitt Jr., a 16-year-old high school student, installed a twenty-watt transmitter at Belmont. The station, WDAA, was born when Dr. C. E. Crosland, Associate President, realized the potential advertising value to the college of a radio station. The WDAA program on April 18, 1922, marked the first time a music program was broadcast in Nashville. The broadcast could be heard 150 to from the school. DeWitt later became WSM (AM) radio station&#x27;s chief engineer, 1932–1942, and president, 1947–1968.

===Ties to the Tennessee Baptist Convention===
In 1951, the Tennessee Baptist Convention bought Ward–Belmont College, the finishing school operated in Nashville by Ward–Belmont, Inc., which was facing severe financial difficulties. The convention established the co-educational Belmont College in March 1951, selecting R. Kelly White as president. In 1959, Herbert Gabhart succeeded White and Belmont was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Enrollment rose from 365 students to 2,000, and the college launched a music business program. He was succeeded by Bill Troutt in 1982, who, at 32, was the youngest college president in the nation. In 1991, it changed its name to Belmont University.

In 2005 Belmont&#x27;s board of trustees sought to remove Belmont University from the control of the Tennessee Baptist Convention while remaining in a &quot;fraternal relationship&quot; with it. Advocates of this plan presented a blueprint for change in which all board members would be Christians, but only 60 percent would be Baptists to affirm a Christian affinity while acknowledging the diversity of both the faculty and the student body. The head of the TBC would continue to be an &quot;ex officio&quot; board member. The TBC rejected this plan. In November 2005, TBC said it wanted to shift its financial support to two other institutions, Union University and Carson-Newman College. Belmont would replace the three percent of its budget that was funded by the TBC. However, on April 7, 2006, TBC sought to oust the existing board and replace it with one consisting entirely of Southern Baptists and amenable to ongoing TBC control. After settlement talks failed, the Tennessee Baptist Convention Executive Board filed a lawsuit on September 29, 2006, against Belmont seeking the return of approximately $58 million.

Belmont severed its ties with the Tennessee Baptist Convention in 2007, with the announcement that it would be a Christian university without any denominational affiliations. Under its terms, the TBC and Belmont would disaffiliate amicably, with Belmont agreeing to pay $1 million to the convention immediately and $250,000 annually for the next forty years, for a total cost of $11 million. The university has stated its intent to maintain a Christian identity but no longer a specifically Baptist one.

===21st century===
Belmont University became a catalyst for anti-discrimination protests in December 2010, when women&#x27;s soccer coach Lisa Howe allegedly lost her job at the university on December 2 after announcing that she was having three children with her same-sex partner. Howe&#x27;s dismissal sparked protests from students and local and national gay-rights advocates. These events led to a citywide anti-discrimination ordinance being passed by the Nashville City Council in January 2011. On January 26, 2011, President Bob Fisher announced that Belmont has added sexual orientation to the university&#x27;s non-discrimination policies. Belmont is a Christian university that was widely regarded for its progressive ideals until the controversy broke out over Howe&#x27;s departure. The college was criticized for not allowing a group with a mission to support gay students and explore the intersection of Christianity and homosexuality called Bridge Builders to officially form as a student group. At a news conference, Fisher stated that they had resubmitted the application. On February 27, 2011, Belmont University officially recognized the gay student organization for the first time. Belmont Provost Thomas Burns and Bridge Builders President Robbie Maris announced the decision to recognize the student group in a joint statement.

In February 2018, Belmont University took ownership of the O&#x27;More College of Design. On March 6, 2019, Belmont University announced that its current College of Visual and Performing Arts will be separated into two distinct colleges with defined areas of focus: the College of Music and Performing Arts will include all music, theatre and dance programs while the O&#x27;More College of Architecture, Art and Design will house architecture, art, fashion, interior design and design communications.

Two years later, Belmont University announced that they would merge with Watkins College of Art, Design &amp; Film, located in Nashville. Belmont and Watkins planned to evaluate employment needs based on the number of students transferring, existing capacities, and related considerations. As a long-standing Christian institution, Belmont&#x27;s policy intention was to hire faculty and staff who support the Christian institution&#x27;s mission, vision, and values; however, due to the nature of merging institutions, the university announced special consideration will be given to current Watkins employees regardless of their position of faith. In May 2021, Belmont sold the former Watkins College campus for $22.5 million, funds which the university states will underwrite scholarships for students of the visual arts.

In July 2020, a group of Belmont University students and alumni began to draw attention to the university&#x27;s longstanding relationship with CoreCivic (formerly the Corrections Corporation of America), asking the school to divest from any financial ties to CoreCivic and for-profit prisons. The relationship between CoreCivic and the university extends to the early 1980s. In 1983, notable Tennessee businessman Jack C. Massey, provided a portion of the initial funding to begin Corrections Corporation of America, along with Thomas Beasley. Discussed as early as 1966, Belmont&#x27;s Massey Graduate School of Business was founded shortly after in 1986. Beasley has also funded major programs at the school, including a free enterprise institute at the Massey Business School. In 2018, Damon Hininger, CEO of CoreCivic, joined the Belmont University Board of Trustees. Shortly after students and alumni began a petition asking for his removal. Hininger is not the first board member with ties to CoreCivic. The current board includes Andrea Overby (donor to CoreCivic PAC in 2018 and wife of Charles Overby, former CCA board member) as well as John Ferguson (former CCA president). As of April 2021, Damon Hininger was no longer a member of the board, having completed his allowed number of terms.

Belmont&#x27;s Mike Curb College of Entertainment &amp; Music Business (CEMB) consists of current/former authors, performers, expert witnesses (for industry lawsuits), artist managers, lawyers, record label executives, songwriters, and others. Mike Curb is the CEO of Curb Records. He was a producer, songwriter, and company executive and one of the most successful record men of the sixties and seventies. He is the department&#x27;s namesake. The former dean of the CEMB, Jim Van Hook, is a legendary Nashville label head, especially as part of the Christian music industry. One of the hallmarks of the program is its internship program, which sends hundreds of students annually out into the Nashville, New York, and Los Angeles music industries to intern for record labels, management companies, publishing companies, booking agencies, publicists, recording studios, law firms, and other businesses.

Besides having three professional-quality recording studios on campus, Belmont owns the Belmont Studios (including Ocean Way Nashville), part of which is operated for-profit (used by such artists as Dave Matthews, Sheryl Crow, and Bob Seger), and part of which is used by students.

Until July 1, 2012, Belmont had been a member of the Atlantic Sun Conference, a non-football conference. The men&#x27;s soccer team was most recently an independent before joining the Horizon League effective with the 2014 season.

In the mid-1990s, Belmont changed its nickname to the &quot;Bruins&quot;, replacing the earlier mascot of Rebels due to its association with the Confederacy. Bruin is Middle English forbear from the Dutch fable &quot;History of Reynard the Fox&quot;, translated by William Caxton.

In 2011 Belmont student-athletes won the Atlantic Sun Conference Academic Trophy for the eighth time in ten years with 76.32 percent of the student-athletes achieving at least a 3.0 grade-point average.

<doc id="289576" wikidata="Q558209" url="?curid=289576" title="Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo">
<text>Jean-Baptiste Philippe Ouédraogo (; born 30 June 1942), also referred to by his initials JBO, is a Burkinabé physician and retired military officer who served as President of Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) from 8 November 1982 to 4 August 1983. He has since mediated a few national political disputes and operates a clinic in Somgandé.

Ouédraogo received his early education in Upper Volta before joining the Upper Voltan Army and studying medicine abroad. After working in healthcare, he was appointed chief medical officer of the Ouagadougou military camp. He participated in the November 1982 coup d&#x27;état and shortly thereafter assumed the presidency. More ideologically moderate than most of his comrades, Ouédraogo did not command much popular support and governed the country amid an unstable political climate. A protracted dispute with Prime Minister Thomas Sankara resulted in his removal from power in a coup in August 1983 and imprisonment. He was released in 1985 and resumed medical work. He opened a clinic in Somgandé in 1992, which he still operates. In the 2010s, he acted as a mediator between opposing political factions.

== Early life and education ==
Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo was born on 30 June 1942 in Kaya, French West Africa.,He started his education at the École Primaire Catholique de Bam, later attending the minor seminary of Pabré before completing his secondary education at the Lycée de Philippe-Zinda-Kaboré de Ouagadougou. He studied medicine at the University of Abidjan and the School of Naval Medicine in Bordeaux, graduating from the latter in 1974. He then took courses at the University of Strasbourg, with a focus in paediatrics. Ouédraogo finished his studies with a doctor of medicine, and degrees in sports medicine and in paediatrics and child welfare.

Ouédraogo became the first head of the paediatrics department at the Centre hospitalier universitaire Yalgado-Ouédraogo in Ouagadougou, serving there from 1976 until 1977. Afterwards he interned at a hospital in Mulhouse until 1981. He married a school teacher, Bernadette, and had three children with her, all of whom became physicians.

== Military career and presidency ==
=== Early military career ===

Ouédraogo was commissioned as a second lieutenant and medic into the Upper Voltan Army in October 1972. In October 1979 he was promoted to &quot;médicin-commandant&quot; (equivalent to major). Three years later he was appointed chief medical officer of the new Ouagadougou military base, Camp Militaire de Gounghin.

=== 1982 coup and assumption of presidency ===
On 7 November 1982 Ouédraogo participated in a military coup which ousted President of Upper Volta Saye Zerbo. He and his fellow military officers then formed the Conseil de Salut du Peuple (CSP). Two days later the council elected him President as a compromise choice between the leftist radicals and conservatives. He was the first Mossi head of state since Maurice Yaméogo. According to Ouédraogo, Captain Thomas Sankara was supposed to take power but withdrew at the last minute, leading other officers to choose him to assume the presidency due to his senior rank though, in his words, &quot;against my will&quot;. Unlike Sankara, he lacked political experience and popular support, and was quickly regarded by the leftist members of the CSP as conservative and sympathetic to policies of France. Ouédraogo thought of his opponents as &quot;hard-core Marxists&quot; and maintained that he was a &quot;liberal and sincere democrat&quot;. Nevertheless, the media viewed Ouédraogo and Sankara as united in goals and dubbed them &quot;Siamese twins&quot;. Shortly after taking power, Ouédraogo told the foreign diplomatic corps in Upper Volta that the new government would uphold a non-aligned foreign policy, respect its international agreements, and defend its territory with &quot;intransigence&quot;.

On 21 November Ouédraogo declared that the CSP would restore a constitutional, civilian regime in two years time. Five days later the CSP installed a formal government. Ouédraogo was the only soldier in the cabinet and, in addition to his role as President, was made Minister of National Defence and Veterans Affairs. On the whole the CSP exercised true control of the government while Ouédraogo served as little more than a figurehead. The freedoms of labour unions and the press, having been restricted under Zerbo&#x27;s reign, were restored by the new administration. Ouédraogo attended Mogho Naba Kougri&#x27;s funeral in December and placed a wreath at the Mossi leader&#x27;s coffin. The CSP elected Sankara as Prime Minister in January 1983, in effect instituting a power counterbalance to Ouédraogo.

On 28 February a plot by several army officers to massacre the CSP in assembly and restore Zerbo&#x27;s regime was foiled when they delayed and were arrested by other officials. One of the leading putschists was a commandant who had been considered for the presidency following the 1982 coup. When questioned about the incident, Ouédraogo told the press, &quot;Since our regime makes many people uneasy, it is quite normal that people should plan this sort of reaction.&quot; He publicly declared his determination to &quot;guarantee order and security&quot; and asserted that &quot;the army will not allow itself to be dissuaded by tribal fights and ideologies&quot;. He also stated that corruption and fraud in the business community had, in part, facilitated the state of &quot;total anarchy&quot; over which the government presided, and announced that the national administration would be restructured to mitigate the disorder.
Meanwhile, as Sankara toured various communist and socialist countries, rumors circulated among the Voltaic population that the CSP would assume a radical leftist approach to governing and expropriate small businesses. In an attempt to alleviate concerns, Ouédraogo told members of the National Council of Voltaic Employers that &quot;private initiative will be maintained...you are the primary motor of the country&#x27;s economic activity&quot;. Sankara concluded his tour with a visit to Libya. A Libyan transport aircraft landed at Ouagadougou Airport shortly after his return, generating rumours of a plot to install a pro-Libya regime in Upper Volta. Ouédraogo assured the populace that it was &quot;a routine visit, a kind of courtesy call and I think that we must not try to see anything beyond that,&quot; and stated that &quot;there should be no talk of setting up a Voltaic Jamahiriya&quot;. On 26 March Ouédraogo and Sankara held a meeting in the capital, where differences in their beliefs began to emerge. That day the CSP organised a large rally in the city where a moderate speech by Ouédraogo was much less enthusiastically received than Sankara&#x27;s radical remarks. From 20 to 26 April Ouédraogo and several of his ministers visited Lomé, Togo; Accra, Ghana; and Niamey, Niger. President Félix Houphouët-Boigny refused to meet him in the Ivory Coast, advising that he should focus on stemming Libyan influence within his own country.

=== Dispute with Sankara and overthrow ===

As his tenure progressed, Ouédraogo found himself unable to reconcile the conservative and radical factions of the CSP, whose disagreements were leading to a political stalemate. On 14 May 1983 the CSP convened in the town of Bobo-Dioulasso. A crowd gathered to hear a message from the council. Sankara spoke until dusk, and the crowd mostly dispersed, its members eager to break their Ramadan fasts. Ouédraogo was in turn left without an audience for his speech, as Sankara seemingly intended in an effort to humiliate him. The following day he met with Guy Penne, a top African affairs adviser of President of France François Mitterrand. On 16 May he purged his government of pro-Libyan and anti-French elements, disbanded the CSP, and had Sankara and several other important officials arrested. Explaining the reasons for the radicals&#x27; removal, he said, &quot;It is a problem of ideology...We were following step by step the program of the Ligue patriotique pour le développement], and that program was to lead us to a communist society.&quot; He met again with Penne, who promised his government significant financial aid from France. One officer, Blaise Compaoré, evaded capture and escaped to Sankara&#x27;s former garrison at Pô where he began to organise resistance. In the following days large demonstrations occurred in Ouagadougou in support of Sankara. Ouédraogo&#x27;s political position was weak; his left-wing opponents were well organised while he did not have reliable connections with the conservative factions he supposedly represented and could only really count on the support of a handful of his former classmates from the Pabré minor seminary. Realising that the use of force was of little recourse, he sought to resolve the situation by appeasing his adversaries.

On 27 May Ouédraogo delivered a speech, promising a quick return to civilian rule and the liberation of political prisoners. He also announced the drafting of a new constitution within six months, to be followed by an election in which he would not participate. He also felt that the increased politicisation of the army was dangerous and compounded the threat of a civil war, so he warned that any soldiers found to be involving themselves in politics would be reprimanded. Stating that the older generation of politicians had been discredited and should retire, he announced that &quot;patriots&quot; and &quot;new men with a sense of responsibility and national realities&quot; should assume leadership of the country. Ouédraogo finished by expressing his hope that the Upper Voltan youth could avoid the trappings of partisan politics. Several days later he released Sankara, who was confined under guard to house arrest. While the situation deteriorated, Ouédraogo accelerated the execution of his goals, liberating many political prisoners held under Zerbo&#x27;s regime. However, his extension of political rehabilitation to Yaméogo antagonised many politicians whom Yaméogo had repressed. Sankara was soon rearrested but then released following mounting pressure from Compaoré&#x27;s troops. On 4 June Ouédraogo removed a number of pro-Sankara ministers from his government.

Tensions continued to increase until 4 August when Compaoré launched a coup. Paratroopers mobilised in Pô to march on Ouagadougou. Meanwhile, Ouédraogo consulted his chief of staff, who advised him to negotiate an end to his political conflict with Sankara. Ouédraogo received Sankara at 19:00 at his residence and offered to resign &quot;to facilitate the establishment of a transitional government that would be unanimous&quot;. Sankara agreed to the proposal but asked for a few hours&#x27; delay so he could discuss it with Compaoré. He departed at 20:30 but was unable to inform Compaoré or the other putschists of the truce. At around the same time the paratroopers infiltrated the capital and began to seize strategic locations throughout. At Ouédraogo&#x27;s residence, men of the Presidential Guard exchanged heavy fire with the putschists before surrendering. Compaoré arrived on the scene at around 22:00, followed by Sankara an hour later. The latter informed Ouédraogo of the &quot;revolution&quot; and offered to exile him and his family. Ouédraogo replied that he would rather remain in the country under the new regime. He was then taken to the Presidential Palace to spend the night. The following evening he was imprisoned at the military camp in Pô. Sankara became the new President of Upper Volta. Ouédraogo was officially removed from his post as Minister of National Defence on 23 August and succeeded by Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lingani. He was discharged from the army two days later. Sankara changed the name of Upper Volta to Burkina Faso in 1984, and three years later he was killed in a coup and replaced by Compaoré.

== Later life ==
Ouédraogo was granted clemency on 4 August 1985 and returned to medical work, taking a job at the Hôpital Yalgado-Ouédraogo. Nevertheless, the Sankara regime monitored his activities and restricted him from reentry into the army. In 1992 he successfully secured a loan of 250 million West African CFA francs from a French bank and founded a clinic, the Notre-Dame de la Paix, in the Somgandé district, south of Ouagadougou. In 2007 he served between 400 and 500 patients a month. In 2005 Ouédraogo was awarded a gold medal by the Geneva-based Foundation for Excellence in Business Practice. He also won the first prize in the Ministry of the Environment&#x27;s competition for the best living environment health facilities in the Centre Region. That December a street in the Nongr-Massom district of Ouagadougou was named after him. In 2016 he was the president of the Fédération des Associations Professionnelles de la Santé Privée. As of 2021 Ouédraogo still worked at his medical clinic.

=== Involvement in politics ===

Upon his return to medical work in 1985 Ouédraogo declared that he would not take an active role in politics and from then on he generally showed little interest in involving himself in public affairs. In 1999 he was made a member of the Conseil du Sages, though by 2014 he had left the consultative body. In November 2012 he delivered a speech on behalf of himself and Saye Zerbo, expressing concern about how corrupt Burkina Faso&#x27;s administration had become over the preceding years and accusing the country&#x27;s leaders of inaction on the matter.

In early 2014 Ouédraogo acted as a mediator between President Compaoré and opposition groups as tensions between the two dramatically rose. However, the arbitration failed in April, and Compaoré later resigned and fled the country. In September 2015 members of the military launched a coup. Ouédraogo was asked to mediate, and he attempted to delay the putschists and secure the release of hostages. As the army turned against the coup he made multiple appeals to the plot&#x27;s leader, Gilbert Diendéré, to surrender. After seeking refuge in the Vatican embassy, Diendéré was handed over to Burkinabé transitional government authorities and Ouédraogo escorted him into custody at the gendarmerie base in the capital. In April 2017 Ouédraogo and several other national figures met with leaders of the Coalition for Democracy and National Reconciliation, an opposition coalition formed out of Compaoré&#x27;s supporters, to discuss political reconciliation. In 2020 he released a memoir titled &quot;Ma part de vérité&quot;.

<doc id="289577" wikidata="Q317161" url="?curid=289577" title="Wayne Shorter">
<text>Wayne Shorter (August 25, 1933 – March 2, 2023) was an American jazz saxophonist, composer and bandleader. Shorter came to mainstream prominence in 1959 upon joining Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers, for whom he eventually became the primary composer. In 1964 he joined Miles Davis&#x27; Second Great Quintet, and then co-founded the jazz fusion band Weather Report in 1970. He recorded more than 20 albums as a bandleader.

Many Shorter compositions have become jazz standards. His music earned worldwide recognition, critical praise, universal commendation, and 12 Grammy Awards. He was acclaimed for his mastery of the soprano saxophone since switching his focus from the tenor in the late 1960s, and began an extended reign in 1970 as &quot;DownBeat&quot;″s annual poll-winner on that instrument, winning the critics&#x27; poll for 10 consecutive years and the readers&#x27; for 18. &quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Ben Ratliff described Shorter in 2008 as &quot;probably jazz&#x27;s greatest living small-group composer and a contender for greatest living improviser&quot;. In 2017, he was awarded the Polar Music Prize.

==Early life and education==
Wayne Shorter was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of Louise and Joseph Shorter. He graduated from Newark Arts High School in 1952. He loved comic books and science fiction as well as music while growing up. Shorter was encouraged by his parents to take clarinet lessons at age 16 and then switched to tenor saxophone prior to enrolling at New York University in 1952. His older brother Alan played alto saxophone before switching to the trumpet in college. While in high school, Wayne also performed with the Nat Phipps Band in Newark. After graduating from NYU with a degree in music education in 1956, Shorter spent two years in the U.S. Army, during which time he played briefly with Horace Silver. After his discharge, he played with Maynard Ferguson. In his youth, Shorter had acquired the nickname &quot;Mr. Gone&quot;, which later became an album title for Weather Report.

==Career==

His early influences include Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane and Coleman Hawkins. In 1959, Shorter joined Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers where he stayed for four years, eventually becoming musical director and composing pieces for the band. Together they toured the US, Japan, and Europe, recording several albums. During this time, Shorter &quot;established himself as one of the most gifted of the young saxophonists&quot; and received international acknowledgment.

===With Miles Davis (1964–70)===
Herbie Hancock said of Shorter&#x27;s tenure in Miles Davis&#x27;s Second Great Quintet: &quot;The master writer to me, in that group, was Wayne Shorter. He still is a master. Wayne was one of the few people who brought music to Miles that didn&#x27;t get changed.&quot; Davis said, &quot;Wayne is a real composer. He writes scores, writes the parts for everybody, just as he wants them to sound. ... Wayne also brought in a kind of curiosity about working with musical rules. If they didn&#x27;t work, then he broke them, but with musical sense; he understood that freedom in music was the ability to know the rules, in order to bend them to your own satisfaction and taste.&quot;

Ian Carr, musician and Rough Guide author, said that with Davis, Shorter found his own voice as a player and composer. &quot;Blakey&#x27;s hard-driving, straight-ahead rhythms had brought out the muscularity in Shorter&#x27;s tenor playing, but the greater freedom of the Davis rhythm-section allowed him to explore new emotional and technical dimensions.&quot;

Shorter remained in Davis&#x27;s band after the breakup of the quintet in 1968, playing on early jazz fusion recordings including &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; and &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; (both 1969). His last live dates and studio recordings with Davis were in 1970.

Until 1968, he played tenor saxophone exclusively. The final album on which he played tenor in the regular sequence of Davis albums was &quot;Filles de Kilimanjaro&quot;. In 1969, he played the soprano saxophone on the Davis album &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; and on his own &quot;Super Nova&quot; (recorded with then-current Davis sidemen Chick Corea and John McLaughlin). When performing live with Davis, and on recordings from summer 1969 to early spring 1970, he played both soprano and tenor saxophones: by the early 1970s, however, he chiefly played soprano.

====Solo Blue Note recordings====
Simultaneous with his time in the Davis quintet, Shorter recorded several albums for Blue Note Records, featuring, almost exclusively, his own compositions, with a variety of line-ups, quartets and larger groups, including Blue Note favorites such as trumpeter Freddie Hubbard. His first Blue Note album (of 11 in total recorded from 1964 to 1970) was &quot;Night Dreamer&quot;, recorded at Rudy Van Gelder&#x27;s studio in 1964 with Lee Morgan (trumpet), McCoy Tyner (piano), Reggie Workman (bass) and Elvin Jones (drums). Two more albums were recorded in 1964, &quot;JuJu&quot; and &quot;Speak No Evil&quot;.

Of the three Blue Note albums Shorter recorded in 1965, &quot;The All Seeing Eye&quot; (rec. 1965, rel. 1966) was a workout with a larger group, while &quot;Adam&#x27;s Apple&quot; (rec. 1966, rel. 1967) was back to carefully constructed melodies by Shorter leading a quartet. Then a sextet again in the following year for &quot;Schizophrenia&quot; (rec. 1967, rel. 1969) with Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, trombonist Curtis Fuller, alto saxophonist/flautist James Spaulding and strong rhythms by drummer Joe Chambers.

Shorter also recorded occasionally as a sideman (again mainly for Blue Note) with trumpeter Donald Byrd, McCoy Tyner, trombonist Grachan Moncur III, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, as well as bandmates Herbie Hancock and drummer Tony Williams.

===Weather Report (1971–1986)===

Following the release of &quot;Odyssey of Iska&quot; in 1970, Shorter formed the fusion group Weather Report with Davis veteran keyboardist Joe Zawinul and bassist Miroslav Vitouš. The other original members were percussionist Airto Moreira, and drummer Alphonse Mouzon. After Vitouš&#x27;s departure in 1973, Shorter and Zawinul co-led the group until the band&#x27;s break-up in late 1985. A variety of musicians would make up Weather Report over the years (most notably the revolutionary bassist Jaco Pastorius and drummers Peter Erskine and Omar Hakim) helping the band produce many high quality recordings in diverse styles, with funk, bebop, Latin jazz, ethnic music, and futurism being the most prevalent denominators.

====Solo and side projects====
Shorter also recorded critically acclaimed albums as a bandleader, notably 1974&#x27;s &quot;Native Dancer&quot;, which featured Hancock and Brazilian composer and vocalist Milton Nascimento.
In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, he toured in the V.S.O.P. quintet. This group was a revival of the 1960s Davis quintet, except that Freddie Hubbard filled the trumpet chair. Shorter appeared with the same former Davis bandmates on the Carlos Santana double LP &quot;The Swing of Delight&quot; (1980), for which he also composed a number of pieces.

From 1977 through 2002, he appeared on 10 Joni Mitchell studio albums, gaining him a wider audience. He played an extended solo on the title track of Steely Dan&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Aja&quot;.

===Later career===
After leaving Weather Report in 1986, Shorter continued to record and lead groups in jazz fusion styles, including touring in 1988 with guitarist Carlos Santana, who appeared on &quot;This is This!&quot; (1986), the last Weather Report disc. There is a concert video recorded at the Lugano Jazz Festival in 1987, with Jim Beard (keyboards), Carl James (bass), Terri Lyne Carrington (drums), and Marilyn Mazur (percussion). In 1989, he contributed to a hit on the rock charts, playing the sax solo on Don Henley&#x27;s song &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot; and also produced the album &quot;Pilar&quot; by the Portuguese singer-songwriter Pilar Homem de Melo. He also maintained an occasional working relationship with Herbie Hancock, including a tribute album recorded shortly after Miles Davis&#x27;s death with Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Tony Williams and Wallace Roney. He continued to appear on Mitchell&#x27;s records in the 1990s and can be heard on the soundtrack of the Harrison Ford film &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1993).

In 1995, Shorter released the album &quot;High Life&quot;, his first solo recording for seven years. It was also his debut as a leader for Verve Records. Shorter composed all the compositions on the album and co-produced it with the bassist Marcus Miller with pianist, synthesist, and sound designer Rachel Z. &quot;High Life&quot; received the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album in 1996.

Shorter worked with Herbie Hancock once again in 1997, on the much acclaimed and heralded album &quot;1+1&quot;. The song &quot;Aung San Suu Kyi&quot; (named for the Burmese pro-democracy activist) won both Hancock and Shorter a Grammy Award.

In 2009, he was announced as one of the headline acts at the Gnaoua World Music Festival in Essaouira, Morocco. His 2013 live album &quot;Without a Net&quot; (rec. 2010) is his first with Blue Note Records since &quot;Odyssey of Iska&quot; (rec. 1970, rel. 1971).

====Quartet====

In 2000, Shorter formed the first permanent acoustic group under his name, a quartet with pianist Danilo Perez, bassist John Patitucci, and drummer Brian Blade, playing his own compositions, many of them reworkings of tunes going back to the 1960s. Four albums of live recordings have been released: &quot;Footprints Live!&quot; (rec. live 2001, rel. 2002); &quot;Beyond the Sound Barrier&quot; (rec. live 2002–2004, rel. 2005); &quot;Without a Net&quot; (rec. live 2010, rel. 2013); and &quot;Emanon&quot; (2018), with the latter, in addition to live material, including Shorter&#x27;s quartet in a studio session with the 34-piece Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. The quartet has received great acclaim from fans and critics, especially for the strength of Shorter&#x27;s tenor saxophone playing. The biography &quot;Footprints: The Life and Work of Wayne Shorter&quot; by journalist Michelle Mercer examines the working life of the musicians as well as Shorter&#x27;s thoughts and Buddhist beliefs. &quot;Beyond the Sound Barrier&quot; received the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album.

Shorter&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Alegría&quot; (his first studio album for 10 years, since &quot;High Life&quot;) received the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album; it features the quartet with a host of other musicians, including pianist Brad Mehldau, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington and former Weather Report percussionist Alex Acuña. Shorter&#x27;s compositions, some new, some reworked from his Miles Davis period, feature the complex Latin rhythms that he specialized in during his Weather Report days.

====&quot;Wayne Shorter: Zero Gravity&quot;====
In 2015, producer/director Dorsay Alavi began filming a documentary about the life of Wayne Shorter called &quot;Wayne Shorter: Zero Gravity&quot;. A number of high-profile musicians, including Herbie Hancock, Esperanza Spalding, and Terri Lyne Carrington, performed at a donor event to raise funds for the documentary; two of the largest donations came from the Herb Alpert Foundation and Carlos Santana. In 2018, a four-hour preliminary cut was completed. Subsequently, Brad Pitt joined the project with his production company. After some delay, partly due to the Covid crisis, from August 2023, the documentary is available as a three-hour miniseries on Amazon Prime Video.

==== Mega Nova ====
In 2016, it was announced that Shorter, Carlos Santana, and Herbie Hancock would begin touring under the name Mega Nova. Also included within the supergroup was bassist Marcus Miller and drummer Cindy Blackman Santana. Their first show together was on August 24, 2016, at the Hollywood Bowl.

====&quot;Iphigenia&quot;====
In 2018, Shorter retired from his near 70-year performing career due to health issues. He continued working as a composer, creating a &quot;new operatic work&quot; titled &quot;Iphigenia&quot;, a loose adaptation of the ancient Greek myth; with Esperanza Spalding writing the libretto and architect Frank Gehry designing the sets, which premiered on November 12, 2021, at the Cutler Majestic Theatre.

==Personal life==
Shorter met Teruko (Irene) Nakagami in 1961. They married and had a daughter, Miyako. Some of his compositions are copyrighted as &quot;Miyako Music&quot; and Shorter dedicated the pieces &quot;Miyako&quot; and &quot;Infant Eyes&quot; to his daughter. The couple separated in 1964.

Shorter met Ana Maria Patricio in 1966 and they married in 1970. In 1986, their daughter Iska died of a grand mal seizure at age 14. Ana Maria and the couple&#x27;s niece, Dalila, were killed on July 17, 1996, in the crash of TWA Flight 800, while travelling to visit Shorter in Italy. Dalila was the daughter of Ana Maria Shorter&#x27;s sister and her husband, jazz vocalist Jon Lucien. Composer and producer Rick Shorter (1934–2017) was Shorter&#x27;s cousin. In 1999, Shorter married Carolina Dos Santos, a close friend of Ana Maria.

Shorter practiced Nichiren Buddhism for more than 50 years as a longtime member of the Buddhist association Soka Gakkai International.

Singer and actress Tina Turner credits Shorter with saving her life. In Turner&#x27;s 2020 spiritual memoir &quot;Happiness Becomes You&quot;, she states that Shorter and Ana Maria gave her critical refuge at their home for six months after Turner left her abusive husband, Ike Turner, in 1976.

Shorter died in Los Angeles, California, on March 2, 2023, aged 89.

===Honors and recognition===

In 1999, Shorter received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from the Berklee College of Music.

On September 17, 2013, Shorter received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz (formerly Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz).

On December 18, 2014, the Recording Academy announced that Shorter had been awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in honor of his &quot;prolific contributions to our culture and history&quot;.

In 2016, Shorter was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in music composition, the only jazz artist to receive the honor that year.

In 2017, Shorter was announced as the joint winner of the Polar Music Prize. The award committee stated: &quot;Without the musical explorations of Wayne Shorter, modern music would not have drilled so deep.&quot;

In 2018, Shorter received the Kennedy Center Honors Award from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for his lifetime of contributions to the arts.

On April 29, 2022, Shorter&#x27;s hometown of Newark renamed a street in his honor. Park Place was renamed &quot;Wayne Shorter Way&quot;.

On April 22, 2023, the BBC Radio Three magazine program &quot;J to Z&quot; broadcast a 90-minute tribute to Shorter, hosted by Julian Joseph.

In August 2023, Herbie Hancock hosted a tribute concert at Hollywood Bowl, featuring a large number of performers including Carlos Santana and Joni Mitchell.

<text>The Avro Shackleton is a British long-range maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) which was used by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the South African Air Force (SAAF). It was developed by Avro from the Avro Lincoln bomber, which itself had been a development of the famous wartime Avro Lancaster bomber.

The Shackleton was developed during the late 1940s as part of Britain&#x27;s military response to the rapid expansion of the Soviet Navy, in particular its submarine force. Produced as the primary type equipping RAF Coastal Command, the &quot;Type 696&quot;, as it was initially designated, incorporated major elements of the Lincoln, as well as the Avro Tudor passenger aircraft, and was furnished with extensive electronics suites in order to perform the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) mission along with a much-improved crew environment to accommodate the long mission times involved in patrol work. Being known for a short time as the &quot;Lincoln ASR.3&quot;, it was decided that the Type 696 would be named &quot;Shackleton&quot; in service, after the polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton.

It entered operational service with the RAF in April 1951. The Shackleton was used primarily in the ASW and MPA roles, but it was also frequently deployed as an aerial search and rescue (SAR) platform and for performing several other secondary roles such as mail delivery and as a crude troop-transport aircraft. In addition to its service with the RAF, South Africa also elected to procure the Shackleton to equip the SAAF. In South African service, the type was operated in the maritime patrol capacity between 1957 and 1984. During March 1971, a number of SAAF Shackletons were used during the SS &quot;Wafra&quot; oil spill, intentionally sinking the stricken oil tanker using depth charges to prevent further ecological contamination.

During the 1970s, the Shackleton was replaced in the maritime patrol role by the jet-powered Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. During its later life, a small number of the RAF&#x27;s existing Shackletons received extensive modifications in order to adapt them to perform the airborne early warning (AEW) role. The type continued to be used in this support capacity until 1991, when it was replaced by the Boeing E-3 Sentry AEW aircraft. These were the last examples of the type remaining in active service.

==Development==
===Origins===
The Battle of the Atlantic was a crucial element of the Second World War, in which Britain sought to protect its shipping from the German U-boat threat. The development of increasingly capable diesel-electric submarines had been rapid; in particular, the snorkel virtually eliminated the need for submarines to surface while on patrol. Aircraft that had once been highly effective submarine-killers had very quickly become incapable in the face of these advances. In addition, lend-leased aircraft such as the Consolidated B-24 Liberator had been returned following the end of hostilities. Several Avro Lancasters had undergone rapid conversion – designated as Maritime Reconnaissance Mk 3 (MR3) – as a stopgap measure for maritime search and rescue and general reconnaissance duties; however, RAF Coastal Command had diminished to only a third of its size immediately after the Second World War.

In the emerging climate of the Cold War and the potential requirement to guard the North Atlantic from an anticipated rapid expansion of the Soviet Navy&#x27;s submarine force, a new aerial platform to perform the anti-submarine mission was required. Work had begun on the requirement for a new maritime patrol aircraft in 1944, at which point there had been an emphasis for long-range platforms for Far East operations; however, with the early end of the war in the Pacific, the requirement was refined considerably. In late 1945, the Air Staff had expressed interest in a conversion of the Avro Lincoln as general reconnaissance and air/sea rescue aircraft; they formalised their requirements for such an aircraft under Air Ministry specification R.5/46. Avro&#x27;s Chief Designer Roy Chadwick initially led the effort to build an aircraft to this requirement, designated as the Avro &quot;Type 696&quot;.

The Type 696 was a significant development upon the Lincoln. Elements of the Avro Tudor airliner were also reused in the design; Lincoln and Tudor had been derivatives of the successful wartime Avro Lancaster bomber. Crucially, the new aircraft was to be capable of a range while carrying up to of weapons and equipment. In addition to featuring a large amount of electronic equipment, the Type 696 had a much-improved crew environment over other aircraft types to allow them to be more effective during the lengthy mission times anticipated. During development the Type 696 was provisionally referred to as the &quot;Lincoln ASR.3&quot; before the officially allocated name &#x27;Shackleton&#x27; was selected.

The first test flight of the prototype Shackleton GR.1, serial &quot;VW135&quot;, was made on 9 March 1949 from the manufacturer&#x27;s airfield at Woodford, Cheshire in the hands of Avro&#x27;s Chief Test Pilot J.H. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Orrell. The GR.1 was later redesignated &quot;Maritime Reconnaissance Mark I&quot; (MR 1). The prototype differed from subsequent production Shackletons in a number of areas; it featured a number of turrets and was equipped for air-to-air refuelling using the looped-line method. These did not feature on production aircraft due to judgments of ineffectiveness or performance difficulties incurred. However, the performance of the prototype had been such that, in addition to the go-ahead for the MR1&#x27;s production, a specification for improved variant was issued in December 1949, before the first production Shackleton had even flown. By 1951, the MR1 had become officially considered as an interim type due to several shortcomings.

===Further development===
The &quot;MR 2&quot; was an improved version of the Shackleton, featuring numerous refinements that had been proposed for the MR1. The radar was upgraded to ASV Mk 13, and the radome relocated from the aircraft&#x27;s nose to a ventral position aft of the bomb bay, the radome was retractable and could be fully extended only with the bomb bay doors open. It had improved allround radar coverage and minimised the risk of bird strikes. Both the nose and tail section were lengthened, the tailplane was redesigned, the undercarriage was strengthened and twin-retractable tailwheels were fitted. The Bristol dorsal turret was initially retained, but was later removed from all aircraft after delivery. The prototype, VW 126, was modified as an aerodynamic prototype at the end of 1950 and first flew with the MR 2 modification on 19 July 1951.

VW 126 was tested at Boscombe Down in August 1951, particular attention being paid to changes made to improve its ground handling, such as the addition of toebrakes and a lockable rudder system. One production Mk 1 aircraft was modified on the line at Woodford with the Mk 2 changes and first flew on 17 June 1952. After trials were successful, it was decided to complete the last ten aircraft being built under the Mk 1 contract to MR 2 standard and further orders were placed for new aircraft. In order to keep pace with changing submarine threats, the Mk 2 force was progressively upgraded, with Phase I, II and III modifications introducing improved radar, weapons and other systems, as well as structural work to increase fatigue life. Production of the MR 2 ended in May 1954.

The &quot;Type 716&quot; Shackleton &quot;MR 3&quot; was another redesign in response to crew feedback and observations. A new tricycle undercarriage was introduced, the fuselage was increased in all main dimensions and had new wings with better ailerons and tip tanks. The weapons capability was also upgraded to include homing torpedoes and Mk 101 Lulu nuclear depth bombs. To reduce crew fatigue on 15-hour flights, the sound deadening was improved and a proper galley and sleeping space were included. Due to these upgrades, the takeoff weight of the RAF&#x27;s MR 3s had risen by over 30,000 lb (13,600 kg) (Ph. III) and assistance from Armstrong Siddeley Viper Mk 203 turbojets was needed on takeoff with a 5-minute limit. The Griffons had to be run at high power for very long periods after a heavyweight take-off so the Vipers were later cleared to run for four hours continuously so lower Griffon power settings could be used which reduced the risk of failures. The extra strain took a toll on the airframe, and flight life of the RAF MR 3s was so reduced that they were outlived by the MR 2s. Due to the arms embargo against South Africa, the SAAF&#x27;s MR 3s never received these upgrades but were maintained independently by the SAAF.

The &quot;Type 719&quot; Shackleton IV, later known as the &quot;MR 4&quot;, was a projected variant intended to meet a Canadian requirement for a long-range patrol aircraft. The MR 4 would have been practically a new aircraft, sharing only the nose, cockpit, and outer wings with earlier variants; it would have also been powered by the Napier Nomad compound engine. The Shackleton IV was cancelled in 1955 and the Canadian requirement subsequently met by the &quot;Britannia Maritime Reconnaissance&quot; later to emerge as the Canadair Argus.

In 1967, ten MR 2s were modified as training aircraft to replace the T 4 in-service with the Maritime Operational Training Unit; known as T 2s, the crew rest areas were replaced by additional radar equipment and the original radar fittings removed.

==Design==

The Shackleton was a purpose-built aircraft for the maritime patrol role; however, the legacy of Avro&#x27;s preceding aircraft is present in many aspects of the overall design. The centre section of the Shackleton&#x27;s wing originates from the Lincoln, while the outer wing and undercarriage were sourced from the Tudor outer wings; at one stage during development, the tailplane had closely resembled the Lincoln&#x27;s, but was enlarged and changed soon after. An entirely new fuselage was adopted, being wider and deeper to provide a large space in which to accommodate the crew, their equipment, and a large bomb bay. Later variants of the Shackleton were substantially redesigned, adopting a new nosewheel undercarriage, redesigned wings and centre-section, and a larger fuel capacity for more range.

Various armaments and equipment were carried by the Shackleton in order to perform its missions. In ASW operations, the ASV Mk 13 radar was the primary detection tool; it could detect a destroyer at a range of , a surfaced submarine at , and a submarine&#x27;s conning tower at , although rough seas considerably reduced the radar&#x27;s effectiveness. Other equipment included droppable sonobuoys, electronic warfare support measures and an Autolycus diesel fume detection system. A special camera bay housed several reconnaissance cameras capable of medium altitude and nighttime vertical photography, and low-altitude oblique photography. The crew would also perform visual searches using various lookout positions that were provided for this purpose. Weapons carried included up to nine bombs, three homing torpedoes or depth-charges; the aircraft also had two 20 mm cannon in a Bristol dorsal turret. An in-flight refueling receptacle could be accommodated, but was not fitted on production aircraft.
The Merlin engines were replaced with the larger, more powerful and slower-revving Rolls-Royce Griffons with contra-rotating propellers. This engine&#x27;s distinctive noise often caused crew members to develop high-tone deafness. The Griffon was needed because the Shackleton was heavier and had more drag than the Lincoln. The Griffon provided equivalent power to the Merlin but at lower engine speed, which led to reduced fuel consumption in the denser air at low altitudes; the Shackleton would often loiter for several hours at roughly or lower when searching for submarines. Lower-revving Griffons, compared to Merlins, reduced engine stress which improved their reliability. Using conventional propellers would have needed an increase in propeller diameter to absorb the engine&#x27;s power and torque, this not being possible due to space limitations imposed by the undercarriage length and engine nacelle positioning; the contra-rotating propellers gave greater blade area within the same propeller diameter.

Numerous problems were encountered during the Shackleton&#x27;s operational service. In practice, the diesel fume detection system was prone to false alarms and thus received little operational use. The engines, hydraulics, and elements of the avionics were known for their unreliability, and the aircraft proved to be fairly maintenance-intensive. The prototype MR 3 was lost due to poor stalling characteristics; this was rectified prior to production, although a satisfactory stall-warning device was not installed until 1969. The Shackleton is often incorrectly assigned the unfortunate distinction of holding the record for the highest number of aircrew killed in one type in peacetime in the RAF. The true figures suggest rather differently in that some of its contemporaries fared far worse, such as the Gloster Meteor with over 430 fatal losses of aircrew against the Shackleton&#x27;s 156. Several programs to support and extend the fatigue life limits of the Shackleton&#x27;s airframe were required; the fatigue life problems ultimately necessitated the rapid introduction of a whole new maritime patrol aircraft in the form of the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod, which began being introduced to RAF service in 1969.
==Operational history==
===Royal Air Force===

On 30 March 1951, the first Shackleton was delivered to No. 120 Squadron RAF; by the end of 1952 seven squadrons were operating the type. the type soon came to be nicknamed &quot;The Growler&quot;, on account of the engine noise from the four Rolls-Royce Griffon engines. The first operational deployment of the Shackleton occurred in 1955 as a troop-transport for British Army movements to Cyprus; less than a year later, the type&#x27;s first combat deployment took place during the Suez Crisis, codenamed Operation Musketeer. In 1957, British RAF Shackletons participated heavily during Jebel Akhdar War in Oman to expand the territory of the Sultanate, which was a &quot;de facto&quot; British colony, in order to gain access to oil wells in the interior parts of Oman. The RAF made 1,635 raids, dropping 1,094 tons and firing 900 rockets at the interior of Oman between July and December 1958 targeting insurgents, mountain top villages, water channels and crops in a war that remained under low profile.

During the 1960s, the typical Shackleton crew comprised two pilots, two navigators, a flight engineer, an air electronics officer, and four air electronics operators. During this period, equipment upgrades had become routine in order to keep pace with ever more capable submarines; problems with airframe fatigue were identified, leading to several programmes being carried out to strengthen the aircraft and thus extend its viable service life. In 1966, nuclear depth charges were introduced to the Shackleton&#x27;s arsenal with the aim of countering the Soviets&#x27; development of deep-diving submarines.

Maritime reconnaissance was a large element of the Shackleton&#x27;s service. This mission was often performed to identify and monitor naval and merchant shipping and to demonstrate sovereignty. During the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation in the 1960s, Shackletons monitored the seas for vessels involved in arms smuggling. Similar operations were conducted in Cyprus, and Shackletons operating from bases in Madagascar cooperated with Royal Navy vessels to enforce a United Nations-mandated oil blockade of Rhodesia.
The Shackleton would often be used to perform search and rescue missions, at all times one crew being kept on standby somewhere across the UK for this role. The Shackleton had also replaced the Avro Lincoln in the colonial policing mission, aircraft often being stationed in the Aden Protectorate and Oman to carry out various support missions, including convoy escorting, supply dropping, photo reconnaissance, communication relaying, and ground-attack missions; the Shackleton was also employed in several short-term bombing operations. Other roles included weather reconnaissance and transport duties, in the latter role each Shackleton could carry freight panniers in the bomb bay or up to 16 fully equipped soldiers.

In 1969, a jet-powered replacement patrol aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod, began to enter RAF service, which was to spell the end for the Shackleton in most roles. While radically differing in external appearance, the Shackleton and the initial version of the Nimrod shared many sensor systems and onboard equipment.

The intention to retire the Shackleton was thwarted by the need to provide AEW coverage in the North Sea and northern Atlantic following the withdrawal of the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s Fairey Gannet aircraft used in the AEW role in the 1970s. As an interim replacement, the existing AN/APS-20 radar was installed in modified Shackleton MR 2s, redesignated the AEW 2, as an interim measure from 1972. These were operated by No. 8 Sqn, based at RAF Lossiemouth. All 12 AEW aircraft were given names from &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot; and &quot;The Herbs&quot; TV series. The intended replacement, the British Aerospace Nimrod AEW3, suffered considerable development difficulties which culminated in the Nimrod AEW 3 being cancelled in favour of an off-the-shelf purchase of the Boeing E-3 Sentry, which allowed the last Shackletons to be retired in 1991.

===South African Air Force===

During the Second World War, the importance of securing the sea routes around the Cape of Good Hope had been made apparent, with over a hundred vessels being sunk in South African waters by enemy vessels between 1942 and 1945. In the postwar situation, the South African Air Force sought a large and capable platform to perform the maritime patrol role. After evaluating four RAF MR 2s in 1953, an order was placed for eight Shackletons as a replacement for the SAAF&#x27;s aging Short Sunderland maritime patrol aircraft. Modifications were required to fulfill South African conditions and requirements, such as the ability to operate over the Indian Ocean, the resulting aircraft was designated the Shackleton MR 3.

On 18 August 1957, the first two Shackletons were delivered to D.F. Malan Airport, Cape Town. Two more followed on 13 October 1957 and the remainder arrived in February 1958. Delivered to the same basic standard as the RAF&#x27;s MR 3s, they were assigned single letter codes between &quot;J&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; and operated by 35 Squadron SAAF. The type typically patrolled the sea lanes around the Cape of Good Hope, often monitoring Soviet vessels traversing between the Indian and Atlantic oceans. The Shackleton was briefly used in low-level overland patrols along the Southern Rhodesian border, but these duties ended following concerns of the disturbance of wildlife.
Often, the Shackleton would be called in to perform search and rescue operations in the treacherous waters around the Cape. In March 1971, Shackletons successfully intervened in the SS Wafra oil spill, deliberately sinking the stricken oil tanker with depth charges in order to prevent an ecological disaster. The only operational loss incurred was 1718 K, which crashed into the Wemmershoek mountains at night time on 8 August 1963 with the loss of all thirteen crew.

Due to an embargo imposed by the United Nations over South Africa&#x27;s policy of apartheid, acquiring components for the Shackleton fleet became increasingly difficult and thus the aircraft&#x27;s serviceability suffered. The fleet had been modified to Phase III standards prior to the implementation of the arms embargo, albeit without the auxiliary Viper engine. Two of the aircraft were re-sparred, 1716 J in the United Kingdom and 1717 O in South Africa by the SAAF, but the lack of engine spares and tyres, together with airframe fatigue, took a gradual toll. By November 1984, the fatigue lives of all but the two re-sparred aircraft had expired and the fleet was retired into storage. Although the joke has been applied to several aircraft, the Shackleton was often described as &quot;a hundred thousand rivets flying in close formation.&quot;

===Avro 696 Shackleton Mk.2===
The Mark 2 had a longer nose and the radome was moved to the ventral position. Lookout position in tail. Dorsal turret and two more 20 mm cannons in nose. Twin retractable tailwheels. One aircraft, WB833, originally ordered as an MR.1 was built as an MR.2 prototype and first flew on 17 June 1952. The last ten MR.1s on the production line were completed as MR.2s and orders for 80 new-build aircraft were placed; the last 21 were completed as MR.3s and the total number of MR.2s built was 69. The first aircraft entered service with 42 Squadron at RAF St Eval in January 1953.

The aircraft were later modified, in parallel with phased modifications to the Mk.3:
MR.Mk.2 Phase 1 or MR.Mk.2C

As per Mk.3 Phase 1. Also received the sonics plotting table from the Mk.3

The Shackleton MR.Mk.2 Phase 2 was as per Mk.3 Phase 2. The MR.Mk.2 Phase 3 was as per Mk.3 Phase 3, except that the Viper engines were not fitted.

Shackleton T.2
Ten MR 2 Phase 3 aircraft were modified in 1967 as T.2s at Langar to replace the T.4s with the Maritime Operational Training Units as radar trainers, with master and slave radar positions for training installed.

Shackleton AEW.2
In 1971 twelve MR.2s were converted at Woodford and Bitteswell as Airborne Early Warning aircraft, the first AEW.2 flew on 30 September 1971 and the type entered service with 8 Squadron on 1 January 1972. The AEW.2 was retired on 1 July 1991.

===Avro 716 Shackleton Mk.3===

Shackleton MR.Mk.3
Maritime reconnaissance, anti-shipping aircraft. The tailwheel configuration was replaced by a tricycle undercarriage, addition of a nose entrance hatch, wingtip tanks to increase fuel capacity. To increase crew comfort the inside was sound proofed, better crew seats and rearranged tactical team positions. To make room for some of the internal rearrangement the dorsal turret was not fitted. The first MR.3 flew on 2 September 1955; the aircraft had problems with stalling characteristics and crashed on 7 December 1956. The variant entered service with 220 Squadron at RAF St Eval in August 1957. The RAF ordered 52 aircraft but later following the 1956 Defence Review it was reduced to 33 aircraft. An additional aircraft was also built to replace the aircraft lost during stalling trials. An additional eight aircraft were exported to South Africa.
The aircraft underwent several phased modifications.

The Phase 1 update introduced changes mainly to the internal equipment.
The Phase 2 update introduced electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment, the distinctive Orange Harvest &#x27;spark plug&#x27; and an improved High Frequency radio.
The third of three MR 3 modification phases including the addition of two Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojet engines at the rear of the outboard engine nacelles to be used for assisted takeoff. The wing main spars had to be strengthened due to the additional engines. A new navigation system was also fitted and there were some modification to the internal arrangement, including a shorter crew rest area to give more room for the tactical positions.

===Projected designs===
;Avro 717 and 719 Shackleton MR.Mk.4
:Project for a re-engined MR.Mk.1 using Napier Nomad engines. Two Nomads were installed in the outer nacelles of a Shackleton prototype to create the only Avro 717 example, but the program was cancelled before the aircraft could be flown. The Avro 719 would have replaced all four Griffons with Nomads.
;Shackleton MR.Mk.5
:MR.Mk.5 was a suggested designation for a Nomad-powered variant of the Mk.2.
