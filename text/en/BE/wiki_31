<text>Fabián Bielinsky (3 February 1959 – 29 June 2006) was an Argentine film director.

== Career ==

Fabián Bielinsky was born in Buenos Aires on February 3, 1959. He started to make films while a student at the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires. At thirteen years old, in 1972, he made his first short film, based on the short story &quot;Continuity of the Parks&quot; by Julio Cortázar. After graduation from high school, he started studying psychology, before dropping out in favor of enrolling in the National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts&#x27;s film school. He graduated in 1983 with a short film called &quot;La espera&quot;, based on a story by Jorge Luis Borges. The short earned him a prize at the Huesca International Film Festival in Spain.

Bielinsky entered the film industry around 1983 as an assistant director, working under such filmmakers as Miguel Pérez, Carlos Soria and Eliseo Subiela. He also worked on a Mégane commercial that Wim Wenders was filming in Argentina. Bielinsky wrote the script for the 1998 film &quot;La sonámbula, recuerdos del futuro&quot; (released abroad as &quot;Sleepwalker&quot;), directed by Fernando Spiner. By 1998, he had worked as assistant director on several feature films and more than 400 TV commercial projects.

Bielinsky directed his first film, &quot;Nine Queens&quot; () in 2000, a crime thriller about a scam involving forged stamps. The film was critically acclaimed both in Argentina and abroad, and earned seven Silver Condor awards, including Best Film, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, as well as 21 more prizes internationally. Bielinsky was asked by several Hollywood companies to remake the film in English, but declined. An American remake, &quot;Criminal&quot;, was produced by Steven Soderbergh and released in 2004, however, receiving tepid response from critics and audience because it lacked ingenuity of the original.

Bielinsky directed his second film, &quot;The Aura&quot;, in 2005. Ricardo Darín, who played the lead in &quot;Nine Queens&quot;, also played the lead role in &quot;The Aura&quot;. While less financially successful that &quot;Nine Queens&quot;, it received critical praise. Critics noted how &quot;The Aura&quot; dropped many of the black comedy elements of &quot;Nine Queens&quot; in favor of a more atmospheric and cerebral noir. The film won Best Film, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay at the Silver Condor awards. The film was the Argentine entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards.

In both of his films various characters mention &quot;El Turco&quot;, a powerful underworld figure who is never shown on screen.

== Personal life and legacy ==

Bielinsky was married and had one child. A month before Bielinsky was going to present &quot;The Aura&quot; at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, he died from a heart attack in his sleep in São Paulo, Brazil, while casting for an advertisement.

In 2011, he was posthumously awarded a Konex Award as one of the 5 best film directors of the decade in Argentina.

<text>Nnamdi Benjamin Azikiwe (16 November 1904 – 11 May 1996), commonly referred to as Zik of Africa, was a Nigerian politician, statesman, and revolutionary leader who served as the 3rd and first black governor-general of Nigeria from 1960 to 1963 and the first president of Nigeria during the First Nigerian Republic (1963–1966). He is widely regarded as the father of Nigerian nationalism as well as one of the major driving forces behind the country&#x27;s independence in 1960.

Born in Zungeru in present-day Niger State to Igbo parents from Onitsha, Anambra State, Azikiwe learned to speak Hausa which was the main indigenous language of the Northern Region. He was later sent to live with his aunt and grandmother in his hometown Onitsha, where he learnt the Igbo language. Living in Lagos State exposed him to learning the Yoruba language, and by the time he was in college, he had been exposed to different Nigerian cultures and spoke the three major Nigerian languages.

Azikiwe was well travelled. He moved to the United States where he was called Ben Azikiwe, and attended Storer College, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and Howard University. He contacted colonial authorities with a request to represent Nigeria at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics since he was also an athlete. He returned to Africa in 1934, where he started working as a journalist in the Gold Coast (present day Ghana). During the British West Africa, Azikiwe advocated as a political activist and journalist, for Nigerian and African nationalism.

==Early life and education==
===Youth: education and background===
Azikiwe was born on 16 November 1904 in Zungeru, Northern Nigeria. His first name, &quot;Nnamdi&quot;, given to him by his parents is an Igbo name which literally means &quot;my father is alive&quot;. His father, Obed-Edom Chukwuemeka Azikiwe (1879–3 March 1958), a native of Onitsha, was a clerk in the British Administration of Nigeria. His mother Rachel Chinwe Ogbenyeanu Azikiwe (née Aghadiuno) (1883 – January 1958), who was sometimes called &quot;Nwanonaku&quot; was the third daughter of Aghadiuno Ajie and a descendant of a royal family in Onitsha; her paternal great-grandfather Ugogwu Anazenwu, was the Obi of Onitsha. Azikiwe had one sibling, a sister, named Cecilia Eziamaka Arinze.

As a young boy, Azikiwe spoke Hausa, the regional language. His father, concerned about his son&#x27;s fluency in Igbo and not Hausa, sent him to Onitsha in 1912 to live with his paternal grandmother and aunt to learn the Igbo language and culture. In Onitsha, Azikiwe attended Holy Trinity School (a Roman Catholic mission school) and Christ Church School (an Anglican primary school). In 1914, while his father was working in Lagos, Azikiwe was bitten by a dog; this prompted his worried father to send him to Lagos, that he may heal and continue school in the city. He then attended Wesleyan Boys&#x27; High School, now known as Methodist Boys&#x27; High School, Lagos. His father was sent to Kaduna two years later, and Azikiwe briefly lived with a relative who was married to a Muslim from Sierra Leone. In 1918, he was back to Onitsha and finished his secondary education at CMS Central School. Azikiwe then worked at the school as a student-teacher, supporting his mother with his earnings. In 1920, his father was posted back to Southern Nigeria Protectorate, in the city of Calabar. Azikiwe joined his father in Calabar, beginning tertiary education at the Hope Waddell Training College. He was introduced to the teachings of Marcus Garvey, Garveyism, which became an important part of his nationalistic rhetoric.

After attending Hope Waddell, Azikiwe was transferred to Methodist Boys&#x27; High School, Lagos, and he made friends with classmates from old Lagos families such as George Shyngle, Francis Cole and Ade Williams (a son of the Akarigbo of Remo). These connections were later beneficial to his political career in Lagos. While at Wesley Boys High school he excelled in his studies and gifted a book titled &quot;from Log Cabin to the White House&quot;, a biography of James A. Garfield, former president of the United States, who rose from grass to grace. The book inspired him to be determined to succeed in life. Azikiwe heard a lecture by James Aggrey, an educator who believed that Africans should receive a college education abroad and return to effect change. After the lecture, Aggrey gave the young Azikiwe a list of schools accepting black students in America.

After completing his secondary education, Azikiwe applied to the colonial service and was accepted as a clerk in the treasury department. His time in the colonial service exposed him to racial bias in the colonial government. Azikiwe&#x27;s choice to study in the United States instead of Great Britain was due to influences of Dr. James Kwegyir Aggrey, the biographies of President A. Garfield and Abraham Lincoln, the Marcus Garvey Pan Africanism and the existence of assistances for indigent students, which was not available in Britain. Determined to travel abroad for further education, Azikiwe applied to universities in the U.S. He was admitted by Storer College, contingent on his finding a way to America.

To reach America, he contacted a seaman and made a deal with him to become a stowaway. However, one of his friends on the ship became ill and they were advised to disembark in Sekondi. In Ghana, Azikiwe worked as a police officer; his mother visited, and asked him to return to Nigeria. He returned, and his father was willing to sponsor his trip to America.

Azikiwe attended Storer College&#x27;s two-year preparatory school in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. To fund his living expenses and tuition, he worked a number of menial jobs before enrolling in Howard University in Washington, D.C. in 1927 to obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science. In 1929, he transferred from Howard University to Lincoln University to complete his undergraduate studies and graduated in 1930 with a BA in political science. Azikwe took courses with Alain Locke. Azikiwe was a member of Phi Beta Sigma. He then enrolled at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and in the University of Pennsylvania simultaneously in 1930, receiving a master&#x27;s degree in religion and philosophy from Lincoln University in 1932 and a master&#x27;s degree in anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1933. Azikiwe became a graduate-student instructor in the history and political-science departments at Lincoln University, where he created a course in African history. He was a candidate for a doctoral degree at Columbia University before returning to Nigeria in 1934. Azikiwe&#x27;s doctoral research focused on Liberia in world politics, and his research paper was published by A. H. Stockwell in 1934. During his time in America, he was a columnist for the &quot;Baltimore Afro-American&quot;, &quot;Philadelphia Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Associated Negro Press&quot;. Azikiwe was influenced by the ideals of the African-American press, Garveyism and pan-Africanism.

==Athletics career==
At the start of his career, Azikiwe competed in boxing, athletics, swimming, football and tennis. Football was brought to Nigeria by the British as they colonized Africa. However, any leagues that were formed were segregated. Nnamdi saw this as an injustice and he emerged as a leader in terms of connection sports and politics at the end of the colonial period. In 1934, Zik was denied the right to compete in a track and field event because Nigeria was not allowed to participate. This happened another time because of his Igbo background, and Zik had decided that enough was enough, and wanted to create his own club. Nnamdi founded Zik&#x27;s Athletic Club (ZAC) which would open its doors to sportsmen and women of all races, nationalities, tribes, and classes of Nigeria. In 1942, the club went on to win both the Lagos League and the War Memorial Cup. After these victories, Nnamdi opened up more ZAC branches throughout Nigeria. During the war years ZAC would go on tours. ZAC matches would happen all over the country, and it made the people of Nigeria feel a sense of unity and nationalism that would help them fight for freedom.

In 1949, some ZAC players participated in a tour of England. On the return from the tour they stopped in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria defeated the locals by 2 goals. This victory was more than a decade before Nigerian independence, but it marked the birth of Nigeria&#x27;s National Team. Finally, after years of struggle, in 1959 the last British official left the NFA, and on 22 August 1960, a few weeks prior to its formal independence, Nigeria joined the world football body of FIFA. None of this would have been possible if it was not for Nnamdi Azikiwe. He united Nigeria through sport and brought about a sense of nationalism that was referred to as &#x27;Nigerian-ness&#x27;.



==Writing career==
=== Journalism; newspaper and editing ===
The women&#x27;s resistance against British taxation in 1929 witnessed an extraordinary massacre of women in Opobo by British commanded soldiers and other areas in eastern region. Azikiwe, hearing of the unruly event, wrote an article of condemnation titled ‘Murdering women in Nigeria’ while still studying in the United States in 1930 and a letter which he addressed to the then Pan-Africanist civil rights activist, WEB du bois. While at Lincoln University, Azikiwe wrote his first book titled &#x27;Liberia in world politics&#x27; in 1931.

Azikiwe applied as a foreign-service official for Liberia, but was rejected because he was not a native of the country. By 1934, when Azikiwe returned to Lagos, he was well-known and viewed as a notable figure by some Lagosians and Igbo community. He was welcomed by a handful number of people, proving his writings in America evidently reached Nigeria. In Nigeria, Azikiwe&#x27;s initial goal was to obtain a position commensurate with his education; after several unsuccessful applications (including for a teaching post at King&#x27;s College, Lagos), he accepted an offer from Ghanaian businessman Alfred Ocansey to become the founding editor of the &quot;African Morning Post&quot;, a new daily newspaper in Accra, Ghana. He was given a free hand to run the newspaper, and recruited many of its original staff. Azikiwe wrote &quot;The Inside Stuff by Zik&quot;, a column in which he wrote radical nationalism and black pride which raised some alarm in colonial circles.

As the editor, he promoted pro-African nationalist agendas. Yuri Smertin described his writing as, &quot;passionately denunciatory articles and public statements which censured the existing colonial order: the restrictions on the African&#x27;s right to express their opinions, and racial discrimination&quot;. Yuri also criticized those Africans who belonged to the &#x27;elite&#x27; of colonial society and favoured retaining the existing order, as they regarded it as the &quot;basis of their well-being. During Azikiwe&#x27;s stay in Accra, he advanced his New Africa philosophy later explored in his book, &quot;Renascent Africa&quot;.

In the philosophic ideal, Azikiwe argued that &quot;it is a state where Africans would be divorced from ethnic affiliations and traditional authorities and transformed by five philosophical pillars: spiritual balance, social regeneration, economic determinism, mental emancipation and &quot;risorgimento&quot; nationalism&quot;. Azikiwe did not shy away from Gold Coast politics, and the paper supported the local Mambii party. The &quot;Post&quot;, a local newspaper published a 15 May 1936 article, &quot;Has the African a God?&quot; by I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson, and Azikiwe (as editor) was tried for sedition. He was originally found guilty and sentenced to six months imprisonment. On his conviction, Zik declared, &quot;if because I am an instrument of destiny through which imperialism in West Africa is to be challenged and liquidated, and if in this mission I am compelled to pay the supreme penalty, then there is no need for me to quake or to quiver. I am becoming convinced day by day that the New Africa is destined to become a reality. No force under the heavens can stem it. Even my death cannot postpone its crystallization.&quot; He was later acquitted by the supreme West African Court of Appeal.

Azikiwe returned to Lagos in 1937 and founded the &quot;West African Pilot&quot;, a newspaper which he used to promote nationalism in Nigeria, while the Zik Group established newspapers treating topics in politics and economy in important cities throughout the country. The group&#x27;s flagship newspaper was the &quot;West African Pilot&quot;, which used Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Show the light and the people will find the way&quot; as its motto. Other publications were the &quot;Southern Nigeria Defender&quot; from Warri (later Ibadan), the &quot;Eastern Guardian&quot; (founded in 1940 and published in Port Harcourt), and the &quot;Nigerian Spokesman&quot; in Onitsha. In 1944, the group acquired Dusé Mohamed Ali&#x27;s &quot;The Comet&quot;. Azikiwe&#x27;s newspaper venture was a business, as well as a tool for politics and advocacy. The &quot;Pilot&quot; focused less on advertising than on circulation, largely because expatriate firms dominated the Nigerian economy. Many of Azikiwe&#x27;s newspapers emphasized sensationalism and human-interest stories; the &quot;Pilot&quot; introduced sports coverage and a women&#x27;s section, increasing coverage of Nigerian events compared with the competing news source &quot;Daily Times&quot; (which emphasized expatriate and foreign-news-service stories). The &quot;Pilot&quot; initial run was 6,000 copies daily; at its peak in 1950, it was printing over 20,000 copies. Azikiwe founded other business ventures (such as the African Continental Bank and the Penny Restaurant) at this time, and used his newspapers to advertise them.

Before World War II, the &quot;West African Pilot&quot; was seen as a paper trying to build a circulation base rather than overtly radical. The paper&#x27;s editorials and political coverage focused on injustice to Africans, criticism of the colonial administration and support for the ideas of the educated elites in Lagos. However, by 1940, a gradual change occurred. As he did in the &quot;African Morning Post&quot;, Azikiwe began writing a column entitled &quot;Inside Stuff&quot;, which he sometimes tried to raise political consciousness. The paper&#x27;s editorials called for African independence, particularly after the rise of the Indian independence movement. Although the paper supported Great Britain during the war, it criticized austerity measures such as price controls and wage ceilings. In 1943 the British Council sponsored eight West African editors (including Azikiwe), and he and six other editors used the opportunity to raise awareness of possible political independence. The journalists signed a memorandum calling for gradual socio-political reforms, including abrogation of the crown colony system, regional representation and independence for British West African colonies by 1958 or 1960. The memorandum was ignored by the colonial office, increasing Azikiwe&#x27;s militancy.

He had a controlling interest in over 12 daily, African-run newspapers. Azikiwe&#x27;s articles on African nationalism, black pride and empowerment dismayed many colonialist politicians and benefited many marginalized Africans. East African newspapers generally published in Swahili, with the exception of newsletters such as the &quot;East African Standard&quot;. Azikiwe revolutionized the West African newspaper industry, demonstrating that English-language journalism could be successful. By 1950, the five leading African-run newspapers in the Eastern Region (including the &quot;Nigerian Daily Times&quot;) were outsold by the &quot;Pilot&quot;. On 8 July 1945, the Nigerian government banned Azikiwe&#x27;s &quot;West African Pilot&quot; and &quot;Daily Comet&quot; for misrepresenting information about a general strike. Although Azikiwe acknowledged this, he continued publishing articles about the strike in the &quot;Guardian&quot; (his Port Harcourt newsletter). He led a 1945 general strike, and was the premier of East Nigeria from 1954 to 1959. By the 1960s, after Nigerian independence, the national &quot;West African Pilot&quot; was particularly influential in the east. Azikiwe took particular aim at political groups which advocated exclusion. He was criticized by a Yoruba faction for using his newspaper to suppress opposition to his views. At Azikiwe&#x27;s death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that he &quot;towered over the affairs of Africa&#x27;s most populous nation, attaining the rare status of a truly national hero who came to be admired across the regional and ethnic lines dividing his country.&quot;

==Political career==
Azikiwe became active in the Nigerian Youth Movement (NYM), the country&#x27;s first nationalist organization. Although he supported Samuel Akisanya as the NYM candidate for a vacant seat in the Legislative Council in 1941, while the executive council selected Ernest Ikoli.

Azikiwe resigned from the NYM, accusing the majority Yoruba leadership of discriminating against the Ijebu-Yoruba members and Igbos. Some Ijebu members followed him, splitting the movement along ethnic lines. He entered politics, co-founding the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) with Herbert Macaulay in 1944. Azikiwe became the council&#x27;s secretary-general in 1946. NCNC was made up of nationalist parties, cultural associations, and labour movements including National Democratic Party, Nigerian Union of Students, Market Women Unions, etc. The party was the third political party formed in Nigeria after the Nigerian National Democratic Party (also founded by Herbert Macaulay), and the Nigerian Youth Movement. Notable members of the party included; Fumilayo Ransome-Kuti, M.I.Okpara, J.O. Fadahunsi, Eyo Ita, Margaret Ekpo, Raymond Njoku, F.S. McEwen, Festus Okotie-Eboh, A.K. Blankson, Dennis Osadebay, and T.O.S. Benson.

=== Conspiracy allegations===
As a result of Azikiwe&#x27;s support for a general strike in June 1945 and his attacks on the colonial government, publication of the &quot;West African Pilot&quot; was suspended on 8 July of that year. He praised the striking workers and their leader, Michael Imoudu, accusing the colonial government of exploiting the working class. In August, the newspaper was allowed to resume publication. During the strike, Azikiwe raised the alarm about an assassination plot by unknown individuals working on behalf of the colonial government. His basis for the allegation was a wireless message intercepted by a &quot;Pilot&quot; reporter. After receiving the intercepted message, Azikiwe went into hiding in Onitsha. The &quot;Pilot&quot; published sympathetic editorials during his absence, and many Nigerians believed the assassination story. Azikiwe&#x27;s popularity, and his newspaper circulation, increased during this period. The allegations were doubted by some Nigerians, who believed that he made them up to raise his profile. The skeptics were primarily Yoruba politicians from the Nigerian Youth Movement, creating a rift between the factions and a press war between Azikiwe&#x27;s &quot;Pilot&quot; and the NYM&#x27;s &quot;Daily Service.&quot;

===Zikist Movement===
The youth rallied to fight against the colonial autocracy of Great Britain. One such group of young people were the Zikists. A non violent youth movement – led by Kolawole Balogun, Raji Abdallah, Osita Agwuna, M. C. K. Ajuluchukwu and Abiodun Aloba – was established in 1946 to defend Azikiwe&#x27;s life and his ideals of self-government. Kola Balogun was the first president of the Zikist Movement. In February 1946, Balogun sent invitations to about 20 young men in Lagos, inquiring of their opinion on the national issues. Out of the twenty, twelve of them responded, leading to the creation of the Zikist Movement, as those men became its founding members. Nwafor Orizu coined the term &#x27;Zikism&#x27; from Azikiwe which became the movement&#x27;s name. He was a non member of the movement but a close associate and admirer of Azikiwe, and one of the several youths Azikiwe inspired to study in the US, alongside Eyo Ita and KO Mbadiwe. Raji Abdallah became the second president of the Zikist Movement, following Balogun&#x27;s departure to London, serving from 1948 to 1949. He was instrumental in getting northern support and membership for the movement. Abdallah and Osita Agwuna (his deputy) had just formed the Anti-Colour Bar Movement (ACBM) in Kano, which was opposed to racial discrimination segregating whites and blacks in Nigeria. The ACBM later dissolved into the larger Zikist Movement. Similar to Balogun, in 1948, Abdallah was dismissed from his job with the Kano Rediffusion Service, a radio broadcasting service. The dismissal led him to get more involved with the Zikist Movement. He was fired because his involvement in the Zikist Movement was considered too overtly political for a civil servant.

Abdallah was later arraigned on 7 November 1948 at the Lagos High Court, where he gave a speech, thus saying, &quot;This is an important day indeed. The most important, perhaps in the history of our country. I call it the most-important because it is today that we have to decide, whether we are to be free or remain hereditary bondsmen, who knows not that they must be free?&quot; &quot;I hate the Union Jack with all my heart. Because save in Britain, wherever it goes; far from uniting, it divides the people. I have nothing against King George VI of England. But hate the Crown of Britain with all my heart. Because to me and my countrymen, it is a symbol of oppression, a symbol of persecution and in short, a material manifestation of iniquity. We have passed the age of petition. We have passed the age of resolution. We have passed the age of diplomacy. This is the age of action. Plain, blunt and positive action. Therefore, I am here this evening, to call a spade a spade, an axe an axe, and a machete, a machete.&quot; &quot;Today, I, Habibu Raji Abdallah, by the grace of God, President General of the Zikist Movement and Field Secretary of the NCNC, do hereby, declare myself a free and independent citizen of Nigeria. I owe no allegiance to any foreign Government, and in the absence of any&#x27; government of the people by the people and for the people of Nigeria&#x27;; I am henceforth, not bound to obey any law, other than the Nigerian Native Laws, Customs and International Laws. Therefore, I shall pay no more tax to this Government.Because if you pay, they will use that money to perpetuate their domination over you.&quot; Upon his sentence, he reacted in mitigation to the presiding judge, Justice Gregg, saying, 

&quot;if you sincerely believe that it is a crime to fight for freedom, then by all means, condemn me to death. Were I to be set free today, I cannot give assurance to muzzle my tongue. As for me, my conscience being clear, I shall be satisfied to leave the final verdict to God and His unfathomable river of time. So, proceed to fulfill the pleasure of those who put you here. I shall leave the final verdict to God.&quot;
 His famous phrases travelled beyond the borders of Nigeria and was adopted by Kwame Nkrumah&#x27;s Convention Peoples Party (CPP) of the Gold Coast (now Ghana). The Colonial Government did not take kindly to the revolutionary undertones of Abdallah&#x27;s message. As a result, Abdallah along with nine other leaders of the Zikist Movement were arrested and charged with sedition. This crackdown on Zikist leadership led to another round of reorganization within the Zikist Movement, allowing Nduka Eze to emerge as president, after Abdallah&#x27;s imprisonment, and Mokwugo Okoye as secretary-general. Zikists, in time, outgrew the NCNC, becoming more nationalist than their parent organization. Colonial officers deemed the Zikist movement an unlawful society and promulgated an Order-in-Council, outrightly banning the Zikist Movement on April 12, 1950. The group later dismantled and its members transitioned to politics, business, and traditional rulership.

=== Opposition to Richards constitution ===
In 1945, British governor Arthur Richards presented proposals for a revision of the Clifford constitution of 1922. Included in the proposal was an increase in the number of nominated African members to the Legislative Council. However, the changes were opposed by nationalists such as Azikiwe. NCNC politicians opposed unilateral decisions made by Arthur Richards and a constitutional provision allowing only four elected African members; the rest would be nominated candidates. The nominated African candidates were loyal to the colonial government, and would not aggressively seek self-government. Another basis of opposition was little input for the advancement of Africans to senior civil-service positions. The NCNC prepared to argue its case to the new Labour government of Clement Attlee in Britain. A tour of the country was begun to raise awareness of the party&#x27;s concerns and to raise money for the UK protest. NCNC president Herbert Macaulay died during the tour, and Azikiwe assumed leadership of the party. He led the delegation to London and, in preparation for the trip, traveled to the US to seek sympathy for the party&#x27;s case. Azikiwe met Eleanor Roosevelt at Hyde Park, and spoke about the &quot;emancipation of Nigeria from political thralldom, economic insecurity and social disabilities&quot;.

The UK delegation included Azikiwe, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, Zanna Dipcharima, Abubakar Olorunimbe, P. M. Kale, Adeleke Adedoyin and Nyong Essien. They visited the Fabian Society&#x27;s Colonial Bureau, the Labor Imperial Committee and the West African Students&#x27; Union to raise awareness of its proposals for amendments to the 1922 constitution. Included in the NCNC proposals was consultation with Africans about changes to the Nigerian constitution, more power to the regional House of Assemblies and limiting the powers of the central Legislative Council to defense, currency and foreign affairs. The delegation submitted its proposals to the colonial secretary, but little was done to change to Richards&#x27; proposals. The Richards constitution took effect in 1947, and Azikiwe contested one of the Lagos seats to delay its implementation.

=== 1950–1953 ===
Under the Richards constitution, Azikiwe was elected to the Legislative Council in a Lagos municipal election from the National Democratic Party (an NCNC subsidiary). He and the party representative did not attend the first session of the council, and agitation for changes to the Richards constitution led to the Macpherson constitution. The Macpherson constitution took effect in 1951 and, like the Richards constitution, called for elections to the regional House of Assembly. Azikiwe opposed the changes, and contested for the chance to change the new constitution.

Staggered elections were held from August to December 1951. In the Western Region (where Azikiwe stood), two parties were dominant: Azikiwe&#x27;s NCNC and the Action Group. Elections for the Western Regional Assembly were held in September and December 1951 because the constitution allowed an electoral college to choose members of the national legislature; an Action Group majority in the house might prevent Azikiwe from going to the House of Representatives. He won a regional assembly seat from Lagos, but the opposition party claimed a majority in the House of Assembly and Azikiwe did not represent Lagos in the federal House of Representatives. In 1951, he became leader of the Opposition to the government of Obafemi Awolowo in the Western Region&#x27;s House of Assembly. Azikiwe&#x27;s non-selection to the national assembly caused chaos in the west. An agreement by elected NCNC members from Lagos to step down for Azikiwe if he was not nominated broke down. Azikiwe blamed the constitution, and wanted changes made. The NCNC (which dominated the Eastern Region) agreed, and committed to amending the constitution.

Azikiwe moved to the Eastern Region in 1952, and the NCNC-dominated regional assembly made proposals to accommodate him. Although the party&#x27;s regional and central ministers were asked to resign in a cabinet reshuffle, most ignored the request. The regional assembly then passed a vote of no confidence on the ministers, and appropriation bills sent to the ministry were rejected. This created an impasse in the region, and the lieutenant governor dissolved the regional house. A new election returned Azikiwe as a member of the Eastern Assembly. He was selected as Chief Minister, and became premier of Nigeria&#x27;s Eastern Region in 1954 when it became a federating unit.

==Premier of Eastern region==
Azikiwe became the premier of the Eastern Region in 1954 after a new constitution was put into effect. Azikiwe&#x27;s Eastern region economic commission collaborated with Europe and North America in order promote investment for developments in textile, vegetable oil refineries, steel and chemicals in the region. He built the famous Nigeria Cement Company at Nkalagu in today&#x27;s Ebonyi State, and it was commissioned on 1 January 1955. He built Niger gas. He also established Nigeria&#x27;s first steel company, Niger Steel. He established Nigeria&#x27;s first indigenous bank, African Continental Bank (ACB). The ACB&#x27;s emergence caused the Western Nigerian government to set up the National Bank of Nigeria and the northern government to establish the Bank of the North. The ACB was instrumental to the emergence of a big entrepreneurial class in the East from the 1950s. The bank also played a critical part in the rise of the former Biafrans at the cessation of hostilities in 1970. He instituted education program that enabled Nigeria becoming the leading exporter of study abroad in Africa.

Azikiwe set up the Eastern Nigerian Development Corporation, which played a critical role in the building of the University of Nigeria at Nsukka, the country&#x27;s first indigenous, full-fledged university, in 1960. The University of Nigeria was founded on 18 May 1955, after a law to establish the university was passed under the joint auspices of the Inter-University Council for Higher Education and Overseas and the International Co-operation Administration (now USAID), J.W. Cook (VC of University of Exeter), Dr John A. Hannah (President of Michigan State University), and Dr Glen L. Taggart, Dean of International Programmes (MSU), came to Nigeria in 1958. The team surveyed the site at Nsukka, and extensively investigated a great variety of factors pertinent to the establishment of a new university.

The foundation stone was laid during the celebration of Nigeria&#x27;s independence by HRH, Princess Alexandra of Kent, who represented Queen Elizabeth II. Classes began on 17 October 1960 with an enrollment of 220 students and 13 members of the academic staff. It became the first University in Nigeria, the first university established by a Nigerian Regional Government, and in 1963, the first University to award Nigerian degrees.

In 1957, Azikiwe addressed British and Nigerian delegates at the 1957 Lancaster House Conference, where the federal constitution for an independent Nigeria was prepared. The meeting which was chaired by the British Colonial Secretary had some Nigerian delegates represented. The delegation was led by Abubakar Tafawa Balewa of Northern People&#x27;s Congress, Obafemi Awolowo of the Action group, Eyo Ita of National Independent Party and Ahmadu Bello of Northern People&#x27;s Congress.

On 3 February 1959, Azikiwe received Kwame Nkrumah (newly elected prime minister of Ghana) who toured eastern Nigeria. He visited eastern region house of assembly with his entourage, Hon. Minister of External Affairs, Mr. Kodjo Botsio and Adviser on African Affairs, Mr. George Padmore. Nnamdi Azikiwe used the occasion, at the eastern house of assembly, to give a speech honoring Prime Minister Nkrumah and recalled how Kwame has been dedicated to the African course.

On 1 October 1959, Azikiwe was succeeded by Michael Okpara as the premier of eastern region. On 28 October 1959, Governor general Robertson announced the dissolution of 184-member Federal House of Representatives with effect from 1 November 1959, so that independence election would be held.

On 12 December 1959, parliamentary elections were held in Nigeria to contest for 312 seats in the House of Representatives. Azikiwe&#x27;s National Council of Nigeria and Cameroon (NCNC) came first with 2,594,577 votes and 89 seats.

Awolowo&#x27;s Action Group (AG), came 2nd with 1,992, 364 votes and 75 seats. Tafawa Balewa&#x27;s Northern People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) came 3rd with 1,922,179 and 148 of the 312 seats in the House of Representatives.

The three major political parties in the election could not get enough seats to form a government. Governor General Robertson called on Tafawa Balewa to form a government. On 16 December, Ahmadu Bello and Tafawa Balewa tried to reach a compromise on a possible coalition government between NPC and NCNC. Governor General was informed about the partnership, hence he approved a sixteen-member cabinet proposed by Balewa.

==Nigeria Independence ==


On 29 July 1960, the United Kingdom parliament passed the Nigerian Independence Act, 1960, which provided for independent Nigeria. At the night of 30 September 1960 the British Union Jack was lowered in a celebration ceremony attended by dignitaries. On 3 October 1960, Princess Alexandra who represented the Queen, opened the country&#x27;s first Parliament. A new constitution, establishing a federal system with an elected prime minister and a ceremonial head of state was created. The coalition government of NCNC and NPC was in power when Nigeria attained independence in 1960 with Sir Tafawa Balewa as Prime Minister and Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe as Senate President.

Soon after, Azikiwe succeeded Sir James Robertson as the first indigenous Governor-General. However, under the Independent Constitution of Nigeria, the governor-general was only a ceremonial head of state. The positions of Governor-General and membership of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council placed Azikiwe above party politics. Nigeria&#x27;s first indigenous Executive Cabinet of Tafawa Balewa included; M Johnson, Bukar Dipcharima, Ayo Rosiji, Aja Wachukwu, Kolawole Balogun, and Victor Mukete (Cameroon), Samuel Akintola, Raymond Njoku, Alhaji Ribadu, Kingsley O. Mbadiwe, Festus Okotie-Eboh, and Allaji Inua Wada.

Sir Tafawa Balewa delivered a speech at Race Course (now Tafawa Balewa Square) in Lagos at the Independence Ceremony. In his speech he said, &quot;Today&#x27;s ceremony marks the culmination of a process which began fifteen years ago and has now reached a happy and successful conclusion. It is with justifiable pride that we claim the achievement of our Independence to be unparalleled in the annals of history. Each step of our constitutional advance has been purposefully and peacefully planned with full and open consultation, not only between representatives of all the various interests in Nigeria but in harmonious cooperation with the administering power which has today relinquished its authority.&quot;

== Governor General of Nigeria==
Azikiwe was recommended as the successor to Sir James Robertson, by the British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, during his visit to Lagos in early 1960. The post of Governor-General of the federation in titular terms made him the representative of the British Queen in Nigeria. Azikiwe&#x27;s inauguration in November 1960, witnessed some of his colleagues in the Black Atlantic, some of them which includes Martin Luther King Jr, Langston Hughes, Nina Simone, Dr. Horace Mann Bond, Ralph Bunche, W.E.B. Du Bois, Shirley Graham Du Bois, Amy Jacques Garvey, and George S. Schuyler. Martin Luther King Jr. remarked that the liberation struggles in Nigeria and in other African nations were having a profound impact on the American civil rights movement, noting that Azikiwe and other African leaders were &quot;popular heroes on most Negro college campuses. In Azikiwe&#x27;s inaugural speech, he commented on &quot;the need to revive the stature of man in Africa and restore the dignity of man in the world.&quot;

Towards the end of his address, Zik said, &quot;those of us, who may be rightly described as the makers of contemporary Nigeria, have ushered freedom into our country and preserved our unity as a nation&quot;, which &quot;history has assigned to me an important part to play in order that this unity may have lasting effects and to bring home to our people the need to maintain it religiously.&quot; He also said &quot;I shall not have consideration for personal comforts or even safety or even life itself, if these are the price I must pay for leadership in order to preserve the freedom and unity of my country.&quot;

Azikiwe attended the First International Labour Organization (ILO) African Regional Conference, that was held in Lagos, Nigeria in December 1960. In attendance were: Mr. Johnson, Labour Minister of Nigeria and Chairperson of the Conference, Mr. Demby, Labour Minister of Sierra Leone, and David A Morse, ILO Director-General. In December 1961 the American Society of African Culture (AMSAC) organised a large music festival in Lagos, Nigeria. American celebrities such as Nina Simone, Langston Hughes, and Lionel Hampton went on AMSAC&#x27;s fully sponsored trip to strengthen African-American/African connections. They were welcomed by Azikiwe in Lagos.

On 17 November 1961, in a speech at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka, Zik made public his proposal for Nigeria to adopt a republican constitution while remaining a member of the Commonwealth. In 1962, Azikiwe urged African leaders in a Lagos conference, to create an organization of African states. The Lagos Conference drafted a proposed charter for an &quot;Inter-African and Malagasy Organization&quot; under Azikiwe&#x27;s chairmanship. It was later adopted in May 1963 by the Organisation of African Unity.

In 1963, Azikiwe commissioned the first brewery plant built by Guinness outside of Ireland and Great Britain in Lagos.

==Presidency (1963–1966)==

The Federal Republic of Nigeria was established on 1 October 1963, with Abubakar Tafawa Balewa as prime minister (head of government) and Benjamin Nnamdi Azikiwe as president (head of state) and commander in chief of Armed forces. Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa proposed an amendment of the 1960 independence constitution to transform Azikiwe from Governor-General and redesignate his title as a ceremonial President. Balewa suggested that Azikiwe be named president in the 1963 constitution because Nigeria can never adequately reward Dr. Azikiwe for his nationalist activities and service to the nation. Therefore, section 157 of Nigeria&#x27;s 1963 constitution was titled Nnamdi Azikiwe to be president, and read &quot;Nnamdi Azikiwe shall be deemed to be elected President of the Republic on the date of the commencement of this Constitution.&quot;

On 30 December 1964, Nigeria&#x27;s first federal election since independence was held. The election was postponed for several weeks because of discrepancies between the number of names on voting rolls and on census returns. Six months after the election, an estimated 2,000 people died in violence that erupted in the Western Region.

1964 Crisis and Coup

Nigerian Daily Express reported on 3 March 1964, &quot;On attainment of Independence in 1960, our first attempt to ascertain the population of Nigeria was the census exercise in 1962. The then Chairman of the Census Commission was J. J. Warren. The result of the census showed that Northern Nigeria was half a million less in population than the South. The Prime Minister, Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa rejected the result sacked Mr. Warren and had him deported. The Prime Minister proceeded to order a recount in 1963. After due manipulation, the result of the census showed that the North was under counted by 8.5 million during the 1962 exercise which put the national population at 60.5million. The federal government under the Prime Minister scaled above the figure to 65.66 million. They scaled down the population of the North from 31 million to 29.8 million and allotted 28.8 million. The then Premiers, Samuel Ladoke Akintola, Dr. Michael Okpara and Dennis Osadebe of the West, East and Mid Western Region protested.&quot; The controversial federal election of December 1964 caused a massive crisis and ruptured the coalition government of the NPC and the NCNC. The elections were marred by widespread boycotts, rigging, intimidation, arson and violence which left Azikiwe so aghast that he refused to call Prime Minister Balewa to form a new government. For a few days, apocalyptic tension hung over the country until Azikiwe&#x27;s sense of constitutional propriety prevailed.

==Post presidency and final years==

When the opposition leader, Obafemi Awolowo was charged with treason by Balewa&#x27;s government, it led to a lot of criticism by Balewa&#x27;s supporters. Violence broke out in the region after elections took place in 1965; as many were not pleased with the outcome. The tension and violence in the area eventually led to the coup in 1966. Balewa was assassinated on 15 January 1966 in a military coup led by rebellion junior soldiers in Lagos. Premier Samuel Akintola of the Western Region, Finance Minister, Festus Okotie-Eboh, Premier Ahmadu Bello of the Northern Region were also deposed and killed too. According to Max Silloun, he stated &quot;In the aftermath of the coup, Nzeogwu rattled off a list of names that were on the Majors hit list. He mentioned the usual unsurprising suspects such as Bello, Azikiwe, and Akintola. Balewa&#x27;s name was conspicuously absent. Balewa was not killed until it was clear that the coup was doomed to fail. It was clear that not all arrested persons were to be killed. Some politicians such as Sir Kashim Ibrahim and Michael Okpara were arrested but released unharmed.&quot; The Supreme Military Council (SMC) headed by General Johnson Aguyi-Ironsi, as the most senior officer, took control of the government and suspended the constitution on 16 January 1966. Some 3,000 Nigerians fled as refugees to Dahomey.
The Nigerian government abolished the four federal regions on 24 May 1966. Some eastern ethnic groups about 115 individuals were killed in political violence on 28 May-2 June 1966. Major General Aguyi-Ironsi was deposed and killed by Theophillus Danjuma, in a military coup led by Lt. Colonel Murtala Muhammed on 29 July 1966. Some 30 individuals were killed in political violence in Lagos on 29 July-1 August 1966, and some 250,000 eastern ethnic groups fled from the Northern Region to the Eastern Region following the military coup. Lt. Colonel Yakubu Gowon was sworn in as the head of the federal military government following the military coup, and he restored the four federal regions on August 31, 1966. Some 2,000 ethnic Igbos were killed in political violence in the Northern Region from 29 September to 4 October 1966. Lt. Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu, military governor of the Eastern Region of Nigeria, declared that the region would no longer recognize Lt. Colonel Yakubu Gowon as head of the federal military government on 2 March 1967. Lt. Colonel Gowon assumed full powers as commander-in-chief of the armed forces and head of the military government on 27 May 1967. Lt. Colonel Gowon proclaimed a state-of-emergency on 28 May 1967. Lt. Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu, military governor of the Eastern Region, declared the independence of the Republic of Biafra in southern Nigeria on 30 May 1967 after the federal government did not honor the Aburi Accord.

Azikiwe initially supported Biafra and its international recognition. He used his political influence to lead Biafra delegation abroad for recognition of the independent state. By 1968, having seen the consequences the war will have, he appealed unsuccessfully to Biafra&#x27;s leader, Emeka Ojukwu, to finally negotiate with Nigerian leader, Yakubu Gowon. Azikiwe stayed away from politics after the war. He was chancellor of the University of Lagos from 1972 to 1976. Cessation of the military rule and ceding of power to democratic rule in 1979 gave Azikiwe a chance for a political comeback. He joined the Nigerian People&#x27;s Party in 1978, making unsuccessful bids for the presidency in 1979 and 1983. He left politics permanently after the 31 December 1983 military coup led by Muhammadu Buhari.

===Final years===
On 8 November 1989, news media falsely announced Azikiwe&#x27;s death as a result of enquiries from a BBC correspondent about his condition. He eventually resurfaced saying &quot;I am not in a hurry to leave this world, because it is the only planet I know.&quot; In 1991, Azikiwe went to the launching of Nnamdi Azikiwe Centre in Zungeru, his place of birth, by President Ibrahim Babangida. In the summer of 1995, he granted an interview at Lincoln university, Pennsylvania with the Director of Public Relations of the university.

Azikiwe eventually died on 11 May 1996, at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital in Enugu after a prolonged illness. He was 91. Azikiwe was given a state funeral by the government of Sani Abacha, following nearly two weeks of national ceremonies. His body taken to various important cities in the country for mourning and tributes. He was finally buried in his native Onitsha on 16 November 1996, on what would have become his 92nd birthday. At Azikiwe&#x27;s death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked, &quot;He towered over the affairs of Africa&#x27;s most populous nation, attaining the rare status of a truly national hero who came to be admired across the regional and ethnic lines dividing his country.&quot;

In 2019, the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari undertook the completion of Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe Mausoluem and was declared a National monument.

==Historical reputation and legacy==

During the 19th century, the scramble for Africa witnessed European powers having Africa divided, human and natural resources exploited. The development of African political ideology emerged with the intent to search for an ideological project of self- affirmation and assertive cultural nationalism. Among the proponents of Pan Africanism were Nnamdi Azikiwe, the Pilot of Nigerian Independence. Azikiwe&#x27;s place in Nigeria&#x27;s cosmology goes far beyond the positions he held. He gave nationalism and the independence struggle a new meaning. Zik, then in Hope Waddel Institute, was conversant with the ideas of Marcus Garvey on Pan Africanism, emphasizing the empowerment of Africans, and the redemption of Africa by Africans. This made Zik question the legitimacy of Colonialism in Africa, and was inspired by Garvey&#x27;s call for the liberation of Africa from the colonial governments. At a time when Nigeria was still a collection of disparate regions, identities and local units, Zik started canvassing for Nigerian independence and for the creation of a de-ethnicised, de-tribalised sense of Nigerian nationalism and patriotism.

Azikiwe went to the USA where he studied and taught at various segregated universities in the South, experiencing the atmosphere of discrimination and the upsurge of radical `Negro&#x27; resistance. He was also inspired by the 19th century USA president, James A Garfield on grass to grace political ascendancy. On returning to West Africa, his primary concern was, therefore, not a territorial, nationalist struggle, but a universal, world-wide struggle for the black race. As editor of the African Morning Post in Accra, from 1935 to 1937, Azikiwe immediately established a reputation because of his direct `American style&#x27; journalism and bold criticism of the colonial system, of colonial officials as well as of local African leaders. His influence extended throughout British colonial territories and he was the motivating force of some African leaders like Kwame Nkrumah, Julius Nyerere, Dauda Jawara, Kenneth Kaunda and Milton Obote among others.

Azikiwe&#x27;s combative and provocative journalism was the principal source of his fame and power, and the most crucial single precipitant of Nigerian awakening. Azikiwe founded a media outfit called Zik Group, under which he established and edited West African Pilot, which was referred to as &quot;a fire-eating and aggressive nationalist paper of the highest order.&quot; Under Zik Group he revolutionised the West African newspaper industry, demonstrating that English-language journalism could be successful, and expanded his controlling interest to over 12 daily, African-run newspapers. West African Pilot grew exponentially from an initial run of 6 000 copies daily, to printing over 20,000 copies at its peak in 1950s.

=== Currency and postage stamps===

Azikiwe&#x27;s portrait has appeared on Nigeria&#x27;s ₦500 banknote since 2001. His image was included in the postage stamps unveiled during the first anniversary of Federal Republic of Nigeria in 1964 and has since appeared in other stamps.


=== In popular culture ===
The first biography of Azikiwe was authored by himself, published in 1970, titled &quot;My Odyssey: An Autobiography&quot;.

The Federal Government of Nigeria established the Zik Prize, an annual leadership award, in 1995, in honor of Azikiwe.

In 2006, Ben Obi initiated the Zik Annual Lecture Series to immortalize the good works and legacies of Azikiwe.

Azikiwe&#x27;s educational philosophy was portrayed in the University of Nigeria documentary film.

In 2023, Duke of Shomolu Foundation produced a play based on the life and times of Azikiwe.

Michigan State University created the &#x27;Nnamdi Azikiwe International African Student Fellowship&#x27; in 2023, to support MSU international African students to Africa for research. The award was in honor of Azikiwe who partnered with MSU faculty to build a land-grant model university (University of Nigeria) in Eastern Nigeria.

===Traditional honors===

Azikiwe was inducted into the Agbalanze society of Onitsha as Nnanyelugo in 1946, a recognition for Onitsha men with significant accomplishments. In 1962, he became a second-rank red cap chieftain (Ndichie Okwa) as the Oziziani Obi. Chief Azikiwe was installed as the Owelle-Osowa-Anya of Onitsha in 1972, making him a first-rank hereditary red cap nobleman (Ndichie Ume) in the Igbo branch of the Nigerian chieftaincy system.

<doc id="277311" wikidata="Q1161666" url="?curid=277311" title="Thales Group">
<text>Thales S.A., trading as Thales Group () is a French multinational aerospace and defence corporation specialized in electronics. It designs, develops and manufactures a wide variety of aerospace and military systems, devices and equipment but also operates in the cybersecurity and formerly civil ground transportation sectors. The company is headquartered in Paris&#x27; business district, La Défense, and its stock is listed on Euronext Paris.

Founded as Thomson-CSF in 1968, the group was rebranded &quot;Thales&quot; (named after the Greek philosopher Thales , pronounced as in French) in 2000 after a communication audit highlighted Thomson-CSF&#x27;s image deficit, particularly among the young French graduates it sought to recruit. The new name was thus meant to liven up its image and to better reflect the company&#x27;s global expansion since the 1990s. 

Thales is partially owned by the French state and operates in more than 56 countries. In 2017, the company generated nearly €16 billion in revenue and was the 8th largest defence contractor in the world, with 55% of its total revenue generated from its military activities.

Patrice Caine was appointed chairman and CEO in December 2014.

==History==
The firm began as &quot;Compagnie Française Thomson-Houston&quot; (CFTH), established in 1893. In 1968 Thomson-Brandt (a renamed CFTH) merged its electronics arm with that of Compagnie générale de la télégraphie sans fil (CSF) to form Thomson-CSF, which changed its name to Thales in December 2000.

In October 1999, Samsung Electronics announced a 50-50 joint venture with the global French defense contractor. The joint venture, based in South Korea, would be led by a CEO appointed by Samsung Electronics and will take over the entire defense business that Samsung Electronics has been conducting, which employed 697 people and generated sales of KRW 163.1 billion (US$134.5 million) the previous year. The new company would now market Samsung Electronics&#x27; defense communication equipment, satellite communication systems and terminals, fire control systems, radar guidance equipment including detection and tracking devices, and gunner&#x27;s sights; and would begin overseas exports through Thomson&#x27;s sales network. Samsung stated that the two parent companies also intended to combine their respective areas of competitive advantage to jointly develop and sell next-generation products.

In June 2001, Thales formed ThalesRaytheonSystems, an equal-ownership joint venture with Raytheon combining their radar and communication systems divisions. It was restructured in 2016 to sell exclusively to NATO agencies and member states.

In 2002, Thales set up the joint venture company Armaris with the French shipbuilder DCN to offer a total &quot;bottom up&quot; shipbuilding capability. Also in 2002, Thales Broadcast Multimedia, a former subsidiary of Thales, provided China with standard short-wave radio-broadcasting equipment designed for general public radio broadcasting. Though the contract was not for this purpose, it later appeared that China used these ALLISS antennas for jamming foreign radio broadcasts to China.

In 2003, Thales UK&#x27;s design won the competition for the Royal Navy Future Carrier (CVF), and the company now participates in an alliance company with BAE Systems and the United Kingdom&#x27;s Ministry of Defence.

Thales Navigation, a division that produced satellite navigation units, was sold to private equity group Shah Capital Partners in 2006 for $170 million and renamed Magellan.

===Acquisitions===
In 2006, Thales acquired Australian Defence Industries, a major manufacturer of military equipment such as smokeless gunpowder and the Bushmaster IMV.

In April 2006, Thales announced it would acquire Alcatel&#x27;s space business (67% of Alcatel Alenia Space and 33% of Telespazio) and Alcatel&#x27;s Rail Signalling Solutions division, in a deal which raised Alcatel&#x27;s ownership of Thales to 21.66 percent. The French government would also decrease its ownership in Thales to 27.1 percent from 31.3 percent as part of the acquisition. The deal would also include the Systems Integration activities (those not dedicated to telecoms operators, and covering mainly the transport and energy sectors). In January 2007, the 1.7 billion Euro deal ($2.24 billion) was approved.

In 2008, Thales acquired British Hardware security module vendor nCipher.

In December 2008, Alcatel agreed to sell a 20.8% stake in French engineering group Thales SA to Dassault Aviation SA for €1.57 billion ($2.27 billion).

In 2014, Alcatel-Lucent initiated talks to sell its cybersecurity unit to Thales. The deal was signed in October of that year.

In 2016, Thales acquired Vormetric, a data security company, for $400M.

In 2017, it acquired Guavus and bid €4.76B for digital security company Gemalto.

In 2018, Thales committed to divesting nCipher as a condition for its acquisition of Gemalto; in June 2019 it divested nCipher to Entrust.

In 2023, Thales acquired cybersecurity company, Imperva, from Thoma Bravo for $3.6B. The acquisition was completed in December 2023.

== Operations ==

Thales Group supplies electronic devices and equipment used by the French Armed Forces from its past as Thomson-CSF, including the SPECTRA helmet for the army and the &quot;gendarmerie&quot;. It has worked with Dassault Aviation on the Dassault Rafale aircraft and made its SPECTRA defensive aids. Thales often worked with DCNS and designed the electronics used on French ships, and it is involved in the construction of both the and FREMM programs. Thales, as Thomson-CSF, was involved in the Taiwan frigates scandal, relating to the sale of s to Taiwan.

It is also present in Eurosam as Thomson-CSF was a founder of the consortium along with Aérospatiale and Alenia Aeronautica. In February 2004, Thales was awarded a contract for a new command and control system for the French Navy, the SIC 21, that will be fitted on the Charles de Gaulle, many vessels and shore locations.

Additionally, the initially planned French aircraft carrier PA2 involved Thales as the main designer of the ship. However, the project was cancelled in 2013.

Thales is also working on X-ray imaging, finances, energy and operating commercial satellites.

By 2012, the company is mainly composed of five branches: Defense, Security, Space, Aerospace and Ground transportation.

Among the EU-supported projects Thales participates in are:
* Galileo - the European satellite navigation system, similar to GPS/Glonass/BeiDou
* SESAR - both as an aircraft equipment manufacturer and as an ATM system vendor

===Defence===

The company&#x27;s design won the competition for the Royal Navy Future Carrier (CVF). It is part of the AirTanker consortium, the winning bid for the RAF&#x27;s Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft. Thales UK won the contract for the British Army UAV programme, Watchkeeper. It also produces the SWARM remote weapon station. Thales simulators include full motion devices as well as flat panels and other training facilities.

Thales Air Defence produces a range of short-range missile systems such as the Starstreak surface-to-air missile or Lightweight Multi-role Missile (LMM).

In 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, major arms manufacturers, including Thales, reported a sharp increase in interim sales and profits.

===Aerospace===
The Thales ATM (Air Traffic Management) solution is marketed under the name &quot;TopSky&quot;, previously named &quot;EuroCat&quot;. Thales supplies avionics to civil aircraft manufacturers, including Fly-By-Wire systems, cockpit systems, navigation computers, satellite communication, inflight entertainment and electrical systems. The coordination of Thales parts&#x27; servicing and maintenance is coordinated by its MRO division; OEMServices, which handles the repair flow for component maintenance support.

In November 2017, Thales acquired a UK radar provider called Aveillant which produces software-defined holographic radar technology, which can detect small targets such as drones.

In February 2018, Thales won on a A$1.2 billion ($946 million) contract with Airservices Australia and the Australian Department of Defence to unify Australia&#x27;s civil and military airspace under a single air traffic control system, named &quot;OneSKY&quot;.

===Ground transportation===
Thales has major involvement in the UK rail industry as a result of the Racal merger and the 2006 acquisition of Alcatel&#x27;s Rail Signalling Solutions division and transport business. Thales is to modernize 40 per cent of London Tube network London Underground.

In Denmark, Thales now owns 100% of the &quot;East-west Consortium&quot; contracted for a nationwide travel card (Danish: &quot;Rejsekort&quot;).

In India, Thales was selected in December 2014 by the New Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to deliver a completely automatic fare collection system, as well as ticketing equipment. Thales has also been contracted by Hyderabad Metro Rail since 2017 to provide train control automation and communication services for the metro in Hyderabad.

In 2014, the company was tasked with equipping the public transport system of Bordeaux, France, with a contactless ticketing and revenue collection system, to be installed by February 2017. However, due to delays, the system is not expected to be operational until 2019.

In Singapore, Thales was involved in a train collision resulting from a compatibility issue between the old signalling system&#x27;s interface, and the new one. The accident resulted in 38 minor injuries. A similar incident would occur in March 2019 in Hong Kong on the Tsuen Wan line.

In Vietnam, the company was awarded a €265 million contract in 2017 to deliver the telecommunications system for the currently constructed Line 3 of the Hanoi metro. Running behind schedule by one year, the metro line is stated to be launched in 2023.

In Turkey, the Thales team delivered the first High Speed Line in the country in 2009, and has completed more than of the Ankara Istanbul High Speed Line.

Effective 31 May 2024, the ground transportation division was sold off to Hitachi Rail. The deal was made at $2.5 billion.

== Other activities ==
Thales is also a major manufacturer of in-flight entertainment systems on board airliners. Thales&#x27; primary competitors in this area of business include Panasonic Avionics Corporation and Rockwell Collins.

Thales also produces and installs ticketing and communications systems for public transportation via its ticketing and revenue collection division. In November 2016, Thales announced its intention to divest from its transport ticketing, revenue collection, road toll and car park management business. The company entered into negotiations with Paris-based Latour Capital, but the negotiations ended in 2017 after Latour Capital announced this business was &quot;not aligned closely enough with its investment priorities.&quot; After subsequent talks with Chinese investors failed, Thales abandoned the divestment.

== Thales international ==
Thales&#x27; international subsidiaries generated 52% of the company&#x27;s revenue in 2008, with Thales UK being the largest of these accounting for 13% of group revenue. Its large presence in the UK (largely as a result of the Racal acquisition) has resulted in several high-profile contracts.

Thales has offices in:

== Financial information ==
As of June 2024, Thales&#x27; major shareholders are the French state (26.06%) and Dassault Aviation (26.05%).

== Controversies ==
===Greater Manchester===
A High Court case decided in 2012 between Thales (supplier of Greater Manchester&#x27;s tram management system) and Transport for Greater Manchester (TGM) considered the operation of an audit clause in a contract, and the extent to which a supplier must comply with this. Thales had submitted claims for increased costs and for extensions to the time allowed for delivery of the system. TGM made various requests for documents intended to better help assess their claims. The Court instructed Thales to supply the requested documents.

=== Bordeaux project mismanagement ===
Although the ticketing system in Bordeaux was originally due for launch in the summer of 2017, multiple delays pushed the new launch date back by 20 months to 2019. The project&#x27;s many setbacks are considered to reflect negatively on the city&#x27;s reputation, with Bordeaux&#x27;s city&#x27;s mayor and former French prime minister Alain Juppé, calling Thales&#x27; inability to meet its commitments &quot;unacceptable behaviour.&quot;

=== Centralised slush fund ===
Michel Josserand, former head of THEC, a subsidiary of Thales, and Dominique Monleau alleged that Thales has a centralised slush fund that it uses to bribe officials.

=== South Africa ===
On 30 May 2005 Schabir Shaik, the financial advisor to Jacob Zuma, the deputy president of the African National Congress party, was found guilty by the High Court in Durban of organising a bribe on behalf of Thomson-CSF.

On 22 January 2020, the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg ruled that both the Thales Group and Zuma could be criminally tried for alleged illegal arms dealings which Thales was allowed to undergo in South Africa. Zuma is said to have allowed these illegal Thales arms dealings when he was the nation&#x27;s deputy president and is also believed to have partaken in them as well.

=== Taiwanese naval order ===

On 10 June 2011, Thales Group and the French government were ordered to pay 630 million euros (almost a billion US dollars) in fines after the courts heard that bribes had been paid to the Taiwanese government to win a large naval contract. Part (about 27%) of the responsibility was transferred to Thales Group because it held the legacy from Thomson-CSF. , this is the largest corruption case in French history.

=== Brazil submarines ===
In June 2024, police in France, Spain and the Netherlands searched the offices of Thales as part of a corruption probe. The operation is the result of two investigations; the first, opened at the end of 2016, focuses on suspected corruption of a foreign official, criminal association and money laundering involving the sale of submarines, and the construction of the naval base in Brazil. The second concerns similar offences linked to the sale of military and civilian equipment abroad.

=== Kiwirok bombings ===

In October of 2021, the Indonesian government carried out bombing attacks against civilians in Kiwirok, Bintang Mountains Regency, West Papua. Australian investigative journalists found Thales-designed and -manufactured bombs had been used, together with drones made by the Chinese company Ziyan.

=== Russian supplies after arms embargo of the EU ===
Despite an EU arms embargo after the invasion of Crimea, Thales continued to supply systems to the Russian Army. This includes 800 Catherine XP thermal imaging cameras. The contract was signed in 2012. Thales also supplied TACAN navigation systems for 60 Su-30, and SMD55S head-up displays. The contract for these systems was signed in 2014, and deliveries lasted until 2018. Around 20 Topowl helmets were supplied to Russia for the MiG 29.

Sofradir, a joint venture of Thales and Safran, supplied infrared detectors beyond 2016, with 258 of these remaining to be delivered.

<text>Jonathan Frid (December 2, 1924 – April 14, 2012) was a Canadian actor, best known for his role as vampire Barnabas Collins on the gothic television soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. The introduction in 1967 of Frid&#x27;s reluctant, guilt-ridden vampire caused the floundering daytime drama to soar to 20 million daily viewers. His watershed portrayal has been cited as a key influence on contemporary genre film and television series such as &quot;Twilight&quot;, &quot;True Blood&quot; and &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Frid was born of Scottish and English ancestry in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. His birth name was John Herbert Frid. He was the youngest son of Isabel Flora (née McGregor) and Herbert Percival &quot;H.P.&quot; Frid, a construction executive.

As a boy Frid had a natural shyness and struggled academically due to dyslexia, which was not properly understood at that time. His passion for acting began at the age of 16 when he appeared in a production of Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Rivals&quot; at Hillfield School. The following year he joined the local community theatre, The Players&#x27; Guild of Hamilton. The theatre&#x27;s leading director, American actress Gladys Gillan recognized and encouraged the young man&#x27;s talent.

Frid&#x27;s first years of study at McMaster University in Hamilton were interrupted when in 1944 he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II, and served on the destroyer HMCS Algonquin (R17). When the war ended, he returned to McMaster to complete his bachelor&#x27;s degree. During the second half of his tenure he was President of the Drama Club, received accolades for his performances in &quot;The Royal Family&quot; and &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, and graduated in 1948 with the university&#x27;s Honor Society Award for Drama.

===Professional training and career===

In 1949 Frid was accepted at the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After two terms, Frid left and became a leading actor in repertory in Cornwall and Kent for two seasons and toured the country in the West End thriller, &quot;The Third Visitor&quot;. Returning to Canada he ventured to Toronto where he became a featured player for three consecutive seasons in the Toronto Shakespeare Festival, produced and directed by Earle Grey. He studied voice at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts, and in 1952 appeared in &quot;Crime of Passion&quot; at the Jupiter Theatre founded by Greene. He applied his training to radio spots and a few appearances on television for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, including an unusual role as a native in &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;.

In the Fall of 1954 Frid became a graduate student at the Yale School of Drama in New Haven, Connecticut. He would earn his Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Directing, however as one of the most experienced actors in the school, Frid was continually in demand for acting roles in mainstage and student productions including Caesar in &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, and starring in the premiere of William Snyder&#x27;s play &quot;A True and Special Friend&quot;.

In the summer of 1955 fresh from completing the first year of his Master&#x27;s program, Frid was chosen by Director Nikos Psacharopoulos to play a pivotal role in the inaugural season of the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Massachusetts. Frid performed leading roles in six of the ten productions including &quot;The Crucible&quot;, &quot;Time of the Cuckoo&quot;, &quot;Light up the Sky&quot;, and &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; opposite leading lady Cynthia Harris.

After receiving high praise in his second year at Yale for his portrayal of Tullus Aufidius in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, Frid was invited to join the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Connecticut. For two consecutive summer seasons, under the direction of John Houseman, Frid performed with such distinguished actors as Alfred Drake, Earle Hyman, Fritz Weaver, Sada Thompson, and Katharine Hepburn.

After earning his MFA in 1957, Frid joined Hepburn and other members of the American Shakespeare Festival on a national tour of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. When the tour concluded Frid moved to New York City, where he made his off-Broadway debut in &quot;The Golem&quot; directed by Robert Kalfin. In 1961 he began using the stage name Jonathan Frid, first seen in the program for &quot;The Moon in The Yellow River&quot;. He continued to appear in many off-Broadway productions and in regional theatres across the United States. Among them were Front Street Theater in Memphis; Pittsburgh Playhouse; and the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego. His most celebrated Shakespearean performance was the title role of Richard III at the 1965 Summer Festival of Professional Theatre at Pennsylvania State University.

Frid made his Broadway debut as an understudy, and appeared, in the 1964 play &quot;Roar Like a Dove&quot;, directed by Cyril Ritchard and starring Betsy Palmer.

===Television===

Frid&#x27;s United States television appearances began in 1960 with his role as the Earl of Worcester in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; as part of Play of the Week. This was followed by an episode of CBS-TV&#x27;s &quot;Look Up and Live&quot;, &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, and several episodes as a psychiatrist on the CBS-TV soap opera &quot;As The World Turns&quot;. 

Frid is widely known for the role of vampire Barnabas Collins in the original gothic serial &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, which ran from 1966 to 1971.

In early March 1967 Frid was arriving at his Manhattan apartment following the completion of a National Tour of &quot;Hostile Witness&quot; with Ray Milland when he received the phone call from his agent that would change his life: a request to audition for a 13-week role as a vampire. Although planning to move to the West Coast to pursue a teaching position at a Southern California university, Frid appeased his agent by auditioning for the role that, if he got the part, would help finance his move west. He won the role of Barnabas Collins, a vampire released from a chained coffin after 175 years, on the gothic daytime serial &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. Before taping began the producers asked the actor and the writers, including Ron Sproat, a fellow Yale alumnus, to discuss the character&#x27;s development. Collaborating with the writers, Frid explained that when he played villains he invested them with an emotional life. The result was a new interpretation of a vampire: a monster depending upon blood to survive yet fighting to regain his humanity. Frid&#x27;s compelling portrayal of the sympathetic vampire was so popular with audiences that his short-term contract stretched into four years and Frid scrapped his plans to move to the West Coast.

Frid appeared on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and was even a special mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; The iconic image of Frid as Barnabas Collins adorned comic books, paperback gothic novels, bubble gum cards and even a board game, complete with coffin. Screaming teenagers thronged to his personal appearances like he was one of the Beatles.

The Dark Shadows ABC Studios in Manhattan became inundated with fan mail for Frid, at its peak reaching upwards of 5,000 letters per week.

In 1970 &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; became the first soap opera to be converted into a feature-length movie. Frid made his American feature film debut portraying his famous television character in MGM&#x27;s &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot;. While the movie script kept the same characters as the TV series, it was a bloodier, more violent story.

During the run of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, and particularly with the release of &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot;, Frid was made aware of speculation he could be typecast. Both during and immediately after &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, he worked to broaden his acting identity with theatre roles very different from television&#x27;s Barnabas Collins. In 1969 he took a four-week hiatus from the show to star in the Frederick Knott play &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; at the legendary The Little Theatre on the Square in Sullivan, Illinois.

With the announcement of the cancellation of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; in March 1971, Frid returned to performing on stage with the role of Thomas Becket in the Off-Broadway play &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot;, followed by Harry Roat in &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; at the Windmill Dinner Theaters in Fort Worth and Houston. In 1973, Frid performed a supporting role in the TV movie &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Daughter&quot; starring Shelley Winters, and in 1974 starred in Oliver Stone&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Seizure&quot;.

Frid found the role of Barnabas Collins to have many facets with a demanding range of emotions to play. Even so, the heavily promoted image of Barnabas baring his fangs left industry people, who may never have seen the show, with only a caricature of what he actually played. Frid became very conflicted about the commercial career his talent agency was offering. He did not want to become the modern-day version of Bela Lugosi, so he stepped away. For a few years he travelled, lived in Mexico for a while, and enjoyed quiet time out of the spotlight of fame.

==Later career==
Returning to New York, Frid began his journey back to the boards. In 1977 he accepted an invitation from Penn State College to appear in the role of Tony Cavendish in the comedy &quot;The Royal Family&quot; for their Professional Summer Series Festival. This was followed by his participation in stage readings of new plays. Enjoying the low-key, independent nature of this work, he searched for other outlets and discovered one from a very unexpected source.

&quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, which featured an undead character, was a show that refused to die. It was being shown in various markets around the country and internationally - the first soap opera ever to have been syndicated. Committed fans of the series were working to keep the show &#x27;alive&#x27; through fan conventions and special events. Frid overcame his reluctance and appeared in 1982 at an event called Shadowcon VI in Los Angeles.

In addition to question-and-answer sessions Frid read poems and prose, and received an enthusiastic response from the fans. For a new fan event dubbed the Dark Shadows Festival, he created a special program entitled &quot;Genesis of Evil&quot;: Part I was cuttings from classic plays Frid had performed in his career; and Part II was poems and prose fans had written about Barnabas over the years.

In 1985 Frid was invited to do a fundraising television special by the New Jersey Network during which he performed Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; and a soliloquy from &quot;Richard III&quot;. Following the broadcast Jonathan met his business partner Mary O&#x27;Leary. Together they formed the theatrical production company Clunes Associates to develop a one-man show, inspired by &quot;Genesis of Evil&quot;. &quot;Jonathan Frid&#x27;s Fools &amp; Fiends&quot; had its debut at Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island in October 1986.

Two months later, Frid succeeded Abe Vigoda, also a Dark Shadows alumnus, as Jonathan Brewster in the highly successful 1986–87 Broadway revival of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;, Frid toured the country for almost a year with co-stars Jean Stapleton, Marion Ross, Larry Storch and Gary Sandy. After completing the tour of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;, he completely focused on his one-man show &quot;Jonathan Frid&#x27;s Fools &amp; Fiends&quot;, eventually creating two more shows: &quot;Jonathan Frid&#x27;s Fridiculousness&quot; and &quot;Jonathan Frid&#x27;s Shakespearean Odyssey&quot;. Discovering that Reader&#x27;s Theater was his favorite form of acting, he toured for the next eight years performing at numerous colleges, universities, libraries, performing arts centers and private events across the United States and some locations in Canada. While on campuses, he also conducted acting workshops with students and seminars on Shakespeare with educators, fulfilling his deep-rooted desire to teach.
In 1993 Frid welcomed an invitation from Georgia College and State University to direct &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;. While Frid had been directing himself for years in his one-man shows, this was first time he would be directing a company of players since his days at Yale more than a quarter of a century earlier. He selected his former &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; colleague Marie Wallace to portray Eleanor of Aquitaine.

At the age of seventy, Frid moved back to Canada, where he bought his first house in Ancaster, Ontario. He was a regular visitor at the Royal Botanical Gardens (Ontario), became a member of the Richard III Society of Canada, and in 1997 was the Narrator in a production of &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; at the Central Presbyterian Church of Hamilton. From 1998 to 2002 under the banner of Charity Associates he occasionally performed his one-man shows for charities in Canada and the United States. In 2000, he starred as Father Tim Farley in the two-character play &quot;Mass Appeal&quot;, which enjoyed a successful, limited run in Hamilton and at the Stirling Festival Theatre in Stirling, Ontario.

In 2007 Frid returned, after more than a decade, to the Dark Shadows Festivals to celebrate the 40th anniversary of his first appearance as Barnabas Collins. Subsequently, he attended the annual festival for the next four years. In 2010 he returned to the role of Barnabas for the first time in thirty-nine years in Big Finish Productions&#x27; &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; audio drama &quot;The Night Whispers&quot;.

Along with former &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; castmates Lara Parker, David Selby, and Kathryn Leigh Scott, he spent three days at Pinewood Studios in June 2011 filming a cameo appearance as a guest in the &quot;happening&quot; scene for the 2012 Tim Burton &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; film, which became his final film appearance. The film&#x27;s star Johnny Depp told the Los Angeles Times “Jonathan Frid was the reason I used to run home to watch Dark Shadows. His elegance and grace was an inspiration then and will continue to remain one. When I had the honor to finally meet him…he was elegant and magical as I had always imagined.”

==Death and legacy==
At his 1998 induction as a McMaster University Alumni Honoree, Frid said he wanted to be remembered for &quot;creating illusion through body language and the spoken word&quot;.

Frid died at Juravinski Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, of pneumonia and complications after a fall. While some sources at the time variously reported the date of his death as April 13 or April 14, Frid&#x27;s relative, David Howitt, confirmed that Frid died in the early hours of April 14, 2012. Howitt added that while Friday the 13th &quot;makes for good press...it&#x27;s good to get it right&quot;.

Throughout his life Frid had always made himself available to support charities. He donated the bulk of his estate to the Hamilton Community Foundation, co-founded by his father H.P. Frid in 1954.

A biographical film &quot;Dark Shadows and Beyond – The Jonathan Frid Story&quot; was released in October 2021 by MPI Media Group. Film critic Dann Gire of the Daily Herald-Chicago wrote, &quot;Dark Shadows and Beyond – The Jonathan Frid Story is directed with economy and panache by Mary O&#x27;Leary...Her biography of the popular actor evolves into a love letter for the performing arts, exemplified by a man whose devotion to his craft became the driving force in his life&quot;.

<text>An opinion poll, often simply referred to as a survey or a poll (although strictly a poll is an actual election), is a human research survey of public opinion from a particular sample. Opinion polls are usually designed to represent the opinions of a population by conducting a series of questions and then extrapolating generalities in ratio or within confidence intervals. A person who conducts polls is referred to as a pollster.

== History ==
The first known example of an opinion poll was a tally of voter preferences reported by the &quot;Raleigh Star and North Carolina State Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Wilmington American Watchman and Delaware Advertiser&quot; prior to the 1824 presidential election, showing Andrew Jackson leading John Quincy Adams by 335 votes to 169 in the contest for the United States presidency. Since Jackson won the popular vote in that state and the national popular vote, such straw votes gradually became more popular, but they remained local, usually citywide phenomena. 

In 1916, &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; embarked on a national survey (partly as a circulation-raising exercise) and correctly predicted Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s election as president. Mailing out millions of postcards and simply counting the returns, &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; also correctly predicted the victories of Warren Harding in 1920, Calvin Coolidge in 1924, Herbert Hoover in 1928, and Franklin Roosevelt in 1932.

Then, in 1936, its survey of 2.3 million voters suggested that Alf Landon would win the presidential election, but Roosevelt was instead re-elected by a landslide. George Gallup&#x27;s research found that the error was mainly caused by participation bias; those who favored Landon were more enthusiastic about returning their postcards. Furthermore, the postcards were sent to a target audience who were more affluent than the American population as a whole, and therefore more likely to have Republican sympathies. At the same time, Gallup, Archibald Crossley and Elmo Roper conducted surveys that were far smaller but more scientifically based, and all three managed to correctly predict the result. &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; soon went out of business, while polling started to take off. Roper went on to correctly predict the two subsequent reelections of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Louis Harris had been in the field of public opinion since 1947 when he joined the Elmo Roper firm, then later became partner.

In September 1938, Jean Stoetzel, after having met Gallup, created IFOP, the Institut Français d&#x27;Opinion Publique, as the first European survey institute in Paris. Stoetzel started political polls in summer 1939 with the question &quot;Why die for Danzig?&quot;, looking for popular support or dissent with this question asked by appeasement politician and future collaborationist Marcel Déat.

Gallup launched a subsidiary in the United Kingdom that was almost alone in correctly predicting Labour&#x27;s victory in the 1945 general election: virtually all other commentators had expected a victory for the Conservative Party, led by wartime leader Winston Churchill. The Allied occupation powers helped to create survey institutes in all of the Western occupation zones of Germany in 1947 and 1948 to better steer denazification. By the 1950s, various types of polling had spread to most democracies.

Viewed from a long-term perspective, advertising had come under heavy pressure in the early 1930s. The Great Depression forced businesses to drastically cut back on their advertising spending. Layoffs and reductions were common at all agencies. The New Deal furthermore aggressively promoted consumerism, and minimized the value of (or need for) advertising. Historian Jackson Lears argues that &quot;By the late 1930s, though, corporate advertisers had begun a successful counterattack against their critics.&quot; They rehabilitated the concept of consumer sovereignty by inventing scientific public opinion polls, and making it the centerpiece of their own market research, as well as the key to understanding politics. George Gallup, the vice president of Young and Rubicam, and numerous other advertising experts, led the way. Moving into the 1940s, the industry played a leading role in the ideological mobilization of the American people in fighting the Nazis and the Japanese in World War II. As part of that effort, they redefined the &quot;American Way of Life&quot; in terms of a commitment to free enterprise. &quot;Advertisers&quot;, Lears concludes, &quot;played a crucial hegemonic role in creating the consumer culture that dominated post-World War II American society.&quot;

== Sample and polling methods ==
Opinion polls for many years were maintained through telecommunications or in person-to-person contact. Methods and techniques vary, though they are widely accepted in most areas. Over the years, technological innovations have also influenced survey methods such as the availability of electronic clipboards and Internet based polling.

Opinion polling developed into popular applications through popular thought, although response rates for some surveys declined. Also, the following has also led to differentiating results: Some polling organizations, such as Angus Reid Public Opinion, YouGov and Zogby use Internet surveys, where a sample is drawn from a large panel of volunteers, and the results are weighted to reflect the demographics of the population of interest. In contrast, popular web polls draw on whoever wishes to participate rather than a scientific sample of the population, and are therefore not generally considered professional.

Statistical learning methods have been proposed in order to exploit social media content (such as posts on the micro-blogging platform Twitter) for modelling and predicting voting intention polls.

=== Benchmark polls ===
A &quot;benchmark poll&quot; is generally the first poll taken in a campaign. It is often taken before a candidate announces their bid for office, but sometimes it happens immediately following that announcement after they have had some opportunity to raise funds. This is generally a short and simple survey of likely voters. Benchmark polling often relies on timing, which can be a significant problem if a poll is conducted too early for anyone to know about the potential candidate. A benchmark poll needs to be undertaken when voters are starting to learn more about the possible candidate running for office.

A benchmark poll serves a number of purposes for a campaign. First, it gives the candidate a picture of where they stand with the electorate before any campaigning takes place. If the poll is done prior to announcing for office the candidate may use the poll to decide whether or not they should even run for office. Secondly, it shows them where their weaknesses and strengths are in two main areas. The first is the electorate. A benchmark poll shows them what types of voters they are sure to win, those they are sure to lose, and everyone in-between these two extremes. This lets the campaign know which voters are persuadable so they can spend their limited resources in the most effective manner. Second, it can give them an idea of what messages, ideas, or slogans are the strongest with the electorate.

=== Tracking polls ===
In a tracking poll responses are obtained in a number of consecutive periods, for instance daily, and then results are calculated using a moving average of the responses that were gathered over a fixed number of the most recent periods, for example the past five days. In this example, the next calculated results will use data for five days counting backwards from the next day, namely the same data as before, but with the data from the next day included, and without the data from the sixth day before that day.

However, these polls are sometimes subject to dramatic fluctuations, and so political campaigns and candidates are cautious in analyzing their results. An example of a tracking poll that generated controversy over its accuracy, is one conducted during the 2000 U.S. presidential election, by the Gallup Organization. The results for one day showed Democratic candidate Al Gore with an eleven-point lead over Republican candidate George W. Bush. Then, a subsequent poll conducted just two days later showed Bush ahead of Gore by seven points. It was soon determined that the volatility of the results was at least in part due to an uneven distribution of Democratic and Republican affiliated voters in the samples. Though the Gallup Organization argued the volatility in the poll was a genuine representation of the electorate, other polling organizations took steps to reduce such wide variations in their results. One such step included manipulating the proportion of Democrats and Republicans in any given sample, but this method is subject to controversy.

=== Deliberative opinion polls ===
Deliberative Opinion Polls combine the aspects of a public opinion poll and a focus group. These polls bring a group of voters and provide information about specific issues. They are then allowed to discuss those issues with the other voters. Once they know more about the issues, they are polled afterward on their thoughts. Many scholars argue that this type of polling is much more effective than traditional public opinion polling. Unlike traditional public polling, deliberative opinion polls measure what the public believes about issues after being offered information and the ability to discuss them with other voters. Since voters generally do not actively research various issues, they often base their opinions on these issues on what the media and candidates say about them. Scholars argued that these polls can truly reflect voters&#x27; feelings about an issue once they are given the necessary information to learn more about it. Despite this, there are two issues with deliberative opinion polls. First, they are expensive and challenging to perform since they require a representative sample of voters, and the information given on specific issues must be fair and balanced. Second, the results of deliberative opinion polls generally do not reflect the opinions of most voters since most voters do not take the time to research issues the way an academic researches issues.

=== Exit polls ===
Exit polls interview voters just as they are leaving polling places. Unlike general public opinion polls, these are polls of people who voted in the election. Exit polls provide a more accurate picture of which candidates the public prefers in an election because people participating in the poll did vote in the election. Second, these polls are conducted across multiple voting locations across the country, allowing for a comparative analysis between specific regions. For example, in the United States, exit polls are beneficial in accurately determining how the state voters cast their ballot instead of relying on a national survey. Third, exit polls can give journalists and social scientists a greater understanding of why voters voted the way they did and what factors contributed to their vote. 

Exit polling has several disadvantages that can cause controversy depending on its use. First, these polls are not always accurate and can sometimes mislead election reporting. For instance, during the 2016 U.S. primaries, CNN reported that the Democratic primary in New York was too close to call, and they made this judgment based on exit polls. However, the vote count revealed that these exit polls were misleading, and Hillary Clinton was far ahead of Bernie Sanders in the popular vote, winning the state by 58% to 42% margin. The overreliance on exit polling leads to the second point of how it undermines public trust in the media and the electoral process. In the U.S., Congress and state governments have criticized the use of exit polling because Americans tend to believe more in the accuracy of exit polls. If an exit poll shows that American voters were leaning toward a particular candidate, most would assume that the candidate would win. However, as mentioned earlier, an exit poll can sometimes be inaccurate and lead to situations like the 2016 New York primary, where a news organization reports misleading primary results. Government officials argue that since many Americans believe in exit polls more, election results are likely to make voters not think they are impacted electorally and be more doubtful about the credibility of news organizations.

== Potential for inaccuracy ==
Over time, a number of theories and mechanisms have been offered to explain erroneous polling results. Some of these reflect errors on the part of the pollsters; many of them are statistical in nature. Some blame respondents for not providing genuine answers to pollsters, a phenomenon known as social desirability-bias (also referred to as the Bradley effect or the Shy Tory Factor); these terms can be quite controversial. 

=== Margin of error due to sampling ===
Polls based on samples of populations are subject to sampling error which reflects the effects of chance and uncertainty in the sampling process. Sampling polls rely on the law of large numbers to measure the opinions of the whole population based only on a subset, and for this purpose the absolute size of the sample is important, but the percentage of the whole population is not important (unless it happens to be close to the sample size). The possible difference between the sample and whole population is often expressed as a margin of error – usually defined as the radius of a 95% confidence interval for a particular statistic. One example is the percent of people who prefer product A versus product B. When a single, global margin of error is reported for a survey, it refers to the maximum margin of error for all reported percentages using the full sample from the survey. If the statistic is a percentage, this maximum margin of error can be calculated as the radius of the confidence interval for a reported percentage of 50%. Others suggest that a poll with a random sample of 1,000 people has margin of sampling error of ±3% for the estimated percentage of the whole population.

A 3% margin of error means that if the same procedure is used a large number of times, 95% of the time the true population average will be within the sample estimate plus or minus 3%. The margin of error can be reduced by using a larger sample, however if a pollster wishes to reduce the margin of error to 1% they would need a sample of around 10,000 people. In practice, pollsters need to balance the cost of a large sample against the reduction in sampling error and a sample size of around 500–1,000 is a typical compromise for political polls. (To get complete responses it may be necessary to include thousands of additional participators.)

Another way to reduce the margin of error is to rely on poll averages. This makes the assumption that the procedure is similar enough between many different polls and uses the sample size of each poll to create a polling average. Another source of error stems from faulty demographic models by pollsters who weigh their samples by particular variables such as party identification in an election. For example, if you assume that the breakdown of the US population by party identification has not changed since the previous presidential election, you may underestimate a victory or a defeat of a particular party candidate that saw a surge or decline in its party registration relative to the previous presidential election cycle.

Sample Techniques are also used and recommended to reduce sample errors and errors of margin. In chapter four of author Herb Asher he says,&quot;it is probability sampling and statistical theory that enable one to determine sampling error, confidence levels, and the like and to generalize from the results of the sample to the broader population from which it was selected. Other factors also come into play in making a survey scientific. One must select a sample of sufficient size. If the sampling error is too large or the level of confidence too low, it will be difficult to make reasonably precise statements about characteristics of the population of interest to the pollster. A scientific poll not only will have a sufficiently large sample, it will also be sensitive to response rates. Very low response rates will raise questions about how representative and accurate the results are. Are there systematic differences between those who participated in the survey and those who, for whatever reason, did not participate? Sampling methods, sample size, and response rates will all be discussed in this chapter&quot; (Asher 2017).

A caution is that an estimate of a trend is subject to a larger error than an estimate of a level. This is because if one estimates the change, the difference between two numbers &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y,&quot; then one has to contend with errors in both &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. A rough guide is that if the change in measurement falls outside the margin of error it is worth attention.

=== Nonresponse bias ===
Since some people do not answer calls from strangers, or refuse to answer the poll, poll samples may not be representative samples from a population due to a non-response bias. Response rates have been declining, and are down to about 10% in recent years. Various pollsters have attributed this to an increased skepticism and lack of interest in polling. Because of this selection bias, the characteristics of those who agree to be interviewed may be markedly different from those who decline. That is, the actual sample is a biased version of the universe the pollster wants to analyze. In these cases, bias introduces new errors, one way or the other, that are in addition to errors caused by sample size. Error due to bias does not become smaller with larger sample sizes, because taking a larger sample size simply repeats the same mistake on a larger scale. If the people who refuse to answer, or are never reached, have the same characteristics as the people who do answer, then the final results should be unbiased. If the people who do not answer have different opinions then there is bias in the results. In terms of election polls, studies suggest that bias effects are small, but each polling firm has its own techniques for adjusting weights to minimize selection bias.

=== Response bias ===
Survey results may be affected by response bias, where the answers given by respondents do not reflect their true beliefs. This may be deliberately engineered by unscrupulous pollsters in order to generate a certain result or please their clients, but more often is a result of the detailed wording or ordering of questions (see below). Respondents may deliberately try to manipulate the outcome of a poll by e.g. advocating a more extreme position than they actually hold in order to boost their side of the argument or give rapid and ill-considered answers in order to hasten the end of their questioning. Respondents may also feel under social pressure not to give an unpopular answer. For example, respondents might be unwilling to admit to unpopular attitudes like racism or sexism, and thus polls might not reflect the true incidence of these attitudes in the population. In American political parlance, this phenomenon is often referred to as the Bradley effect. If the results of surveys are widely publicized this effect may be magnified – a phenomenon commonly referred to as the spiral of silence.

Use of the plurality voting system (select only one candidate) in a poll puts an unintentional bias into the poll, since people who favor more than one candidate cannot indicate this. The fact that they must choose only one candidate biases the poll, causing it to favor the candidate most different from the others while it disfavors candidates who are similar to other candidates. The plurality voting system also biases elections in the same way.

Some people responding may not understand the words being used, but may wish to avoid the embarrassment of admitting this, or the poll mechanism may not allow clarification, so they may make an arbitrary choice. Some percentage of people also answer whimsically or out of annoyance at being polled. This results in perhaps 4% of Americans reporting they have personally been decapitated.

=== Wording of questions ===
Among the factors that impact the results of opinion polls are the wording and order of the questions being posed by the surveyor. Questions that intentionally affect a respondents answer are referred to as leading questions. Individuals and/or groups use these types of questions in surveys to elicit responses favorable to their interests.

For instance, the public is more likely to indicate support for a person who is described by the surveyor as one of the &quot;leading candidates&quot;. This description is &quot;leading&quot; as it indicates a subtle bias for that candidate, since it implies that the others in the race are not serious contenders. Additionally, leading questions often contain, or lack, certain facts that can sway a respondent&#x27;s answer. Argumentative Questions can also impact the outcome of a survey. These types of questions, depending on their nature, either positive or negative, influence respondents&#x27; answers to reflect the tone of the question(s) and generate a certain response or reaction, rather than gauge sentiment in an unbiased manner.

In opinion polling, there are also &quot;loaded questions&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;trick questions&quot;. This type of leading question may concern an uncomfortable or controversial issue, and/or automatically assume the subject of the question is related to the respondent(s) or that they are knowledgeable about it. Likewise, the questions are then worded in a way that limit the possible answers, typically to yes or no.

Another type of question that can produce inaccurate results are &quot;Double-Negative Questions&quot;. These are more often the result of human error, rather than intentional manipulation. One such example is a survey done in 1992 by the Roper Organization, concerning the Holocaust. The question read &quot;Does it seem possible or impossible to you that the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened?&quot; The confusing wording of this question led to inaccurate results which indicated that 22 percent of respondents believed it seemed possible the Holocaust might not have ever happened. When the question was reworded, significantly fewer respondents (only 1 percent) expressed that same sentiment.

Thus comparisons between polls often boil down to the wording of the question. On some issues, question wording can result in quite pronounced differences between surveys. This can also, however, be a result of legitimately conflicted feelings or evolving attitudes, rather than a poorly constructed survey.

A common technique to control for this bias is to rotate the order in which questions are asked. Many pollsters also split-sample. This involves having two different versions of a question, with each version presented to half the respondents.

The most effective controls, used by attitude researchers, are:

* asking enough questions to allow all aspects of an issue to be covered and to control effects due to the form of the question (such as positive or negative wording), the adequacy of the number being established quantitatively with psychometric measures such as reliability coefficients, and
* analyzing the results with psychometric techniques which synthesize the answers into a few reliable scores and detect ineffective questions.

These controls are not widely used in the polling industry.. However, as it is important that questions to test the product have a high quality, survey methodologists work on methods to test them. Empirical tests provide insight into the quality of the questionnaire, some may be more complex than others. For instance, testing a questionnaire can be done by:
* conducting cognitive interviewing. By asking a sample of potential-respondents about their interpretation of the questions and use of the questionnaire, a researcher can 
* carrying out a small pretest of the questionnaire, using a small subset of target respondents. Results can inform a researcher of errors such as missing questions, or logical and procedural errors.
* estimating the measurement quality of the questions. This can be done for instance using test-retest, quasi-simplex, or mutlitrait-multimethod models.
* predicting the measurement quality of the question. This can be done using the software Survey Quality Predictor (SQP).

=== Involuntary facades and false correlations ===
One of the criticisms of opinion polls is that societal assumptions that opinions between which there is no logical link are &quot;correlated attitudes&quot; can push people with one opinion into a group that forces them to pretend to have a supposedly linked but actually unrelated opinion. That, in turn, may cause people who have the first opinion to claim on polls that they have the second opinion without having it, causing opinion polls to become part of self-fulfilling prophecy problems. It has been suggested that attempts to counteract unethical opinions by condemning supposedly linked opinions may favor the groups that promote the actually unethical opinions by forcing people with supposedly linked opinions into them by ostracism elsewhere in society making such efforts counterproductive, that not being sent between groups that assume ulterior motives from each other and not being allowed to express consistent critical thought anywhere may create psychological stress because humans are sapient, and that discussion spaces free from assumptions of ulterior motives behind specific opinions should be created. In this context, rejection of the assumption that opinion polls show actual links between opinions is considered important.

=== Coverage bias ===
Another source of error is the use of samples that are not representative of the population as a consequence of the methodology used, as was the experience of &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; in 1936. For example, telephone sampling has a built-in error because in many times and places, those with telephones have generally been richer than those without.

In some places many people have only mobile telephones. Because pollsters cannot use automated dialing machines to call mobile phones in the United States (because the phone&#x27;s owner may be charged for taking a call), these individuals are typically excluded from polling samples. There is concern that, if the subset of the population without cell phones differs markedly from the rest of the population, these differences can skew the results of the poll.

Polling organizations have developed many weighting techniques to help overcome these deficiencies, with varying degrees of success. Studies of mobile phone users by the Pew Research Center in the US, in 2007, concluded that &quot;cell-only respondents are different from landline respondents in important ways, (but) they were neither numerous enough nor different enough on the questions we examined to produce a significant change in overall general population survey estimates when included with the landline samples and weighted according to US Census parameters on basic demographic characteristics.&quot; 
This issue was first identified in 2004, but came to prominence only during the 2008 US presidential election. In previous elections, the proportion of the general population using cell phones was small, but as this proportion has increased, there is concern that polling only landlines is no longer representative of the general population. In 2003, only 2.9% of households were wireless (cellphones only), compared to 12.8% in 2006. This results in &quot;coverage error&quot;. Many polling organisations select their sample by dialling random telephone numbers; however, in 2008, there was a clear tendency for polls which included mobile phones in their samples to show a much larger lead for Obama, than polls that did not.

The potential sources of bias are:
# Some households use cellphones only and have no landline. This tends to include minorities and younger voters; and occurs more frequently in metropolitan areas. Men are more likely to be cellphone-only compared to women.
# Some people may not be contactable by landline from Monday to Friday and may be contactable only by cellphone.
# Some people use their landlines only to access the Internet, and answer calls only to their cellphones.

Some polling companies have attempted to get around that problem by including a &quot;cellphone supplement&quot;. There are a number of problems with including cellphones in a telephone poll:
# It is difficult to get co-operation from cellphone users, because in many parts of the US, users are charged for both outgoing and incoming calls. That means that pollsters have had to offer financial compensation to gain co-operation.
# US federal law prohibits the use of automated dialling devices to call cellphones (Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991). Numbers therefore have to be dialled by hand, which is more time-consuming and expensive for pollsters.
== Failures ==
A widely publicized failure of opinion polling to date in the United States was the prediction that Thomas Dewey would defeat Harry S. Truman in the 1948 US presidential election. Major polling organizations, including Gallup and Roper, had indicated that Dewey would defeat Truman in a landslide; Truman won a narrow victory. 

There were also substantial polling errors in the presidential elections of 1952, 1980, 1996, 2000, and 2016: while the first three correctly predicted the winner (albeit not the extent of their winning margin), with the last two correctly predicting the winner of the popular vote (but not the Electoral College).

In the United Kingdom, most polls failed to predict the Conservative election victories of 1970 and 1992, and Labour&#x27;s victory in February 1974. In the 2015 election, virtually every poll predicted a hung parliament with Labour and the Conservatives neck and neck, when the actual result was a clear Conservative majority. On the other hand, in 2017, the opposite appears to have occurred. Most polls predicted an increased Conservative majority, even though in reality the election resulted in a hung parliament with a Conservative plurality: some polls correctly predicted this outcome.

In New Zealand, the polls leading up to the 1993 general election predicted the governing National Party would increase its majority. However, the preliminary results on election night showed a hung parliament with National one seat short of a majority, leading to Prime Minister Jim Bolger exclaiming &quot;bugger the pollsters&quot; on live national television. The official count saw National gain Waitaki to hold a one-seat majority and retain government.

== Social media as a source of opinion on candidates ==
Social media today is a popular medium for the candidates to campaign and for gauging the public reaction to the campaigns. Social media can also be used as an indicator of the voter opinion regarding the poll. Some research studies have shown that predictions made using social media signals can match traditional opinion polls.

Regarding the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a major concern has been that of the effect of false stories spread throughout social media. Evidence shows that social media plays a huge role in the supplying of news: 62 percent of US adults get news on social media. This fact makes the issue of fake news on social media more pertinent. Other evidence shows that the most popular fake news stories were more widely shared on Facebook than the most popular mainstream news stories; many people who see fake news stories report that they believe them; and the most discussed fake news stories tended to favor Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. As a result of these facts, some have concluded that if not for these stories, Donald Trump may not have won the election over Hillary Clinton.

== Influence ==
=== Effect on voters ===
By providing information about voting intentions, opinion polls can sometimes influence the behavior of electors, and in his book &quot;The Broken Compass&quot;, Peter Hitchens asserts that opinion polls are actually a device for influencing public opinion. The various theories about how this happens can be split into two groups: bandwagon/underdog effects, and strategic (&quot;tactical&quot;) voting.

A bandwagon effect occurs when the poll prompts voters to back the candidate shown to be winning in the poll. The idea that voters are susceptible to such effects is old, stemming at least from 1884; William Safire reported that the term was first used in a political cartoon in the magazine &quot;Puck&quot; in that year. It has also remained persistent in spite of a lack of empirical corroboration until the late 20th century. George Gallup spent much effort in vain trying to discredit this theory in his time by presenting empirical research. A recent meta-study of scientific research on this topic indicates that from the 1980s onward the Bandwagon effect is found more often by researchers.

The opposite of the bandwagon effect is the underdog effect. It is often mentioned in the media. This occurs when people vote, out of sympathy, for the party perceived to be &quot;losing&quot; the elections. There is less empirical evidence for the existence of this effect than there is for the existence of the bandwagon effect.

The second category of theories on how polls directly affect voting is called strategic voting. This theory is based on the idea that voters view the act of voting as a means of selecting a government. Thus they will sometimes not choose the candidate they prefer on ground of ideology or sympathy, but another, less-preferred, candidate from strategic considerations. An example can be found in the 1997 United Kingdom general election. As he was then a Cabinet Minister, Michael Portillo&#x27;s constituency of Enfield Southgate was believed to be a safe seat but opinion polls showed the Labour candidate Stephen Twigg steadily gaining support, which may have prompted undecided voters or supporters of other parties to support Twigg in order to remove Portillo. Another example is the boomerang effect where the likely supporters of the candidate shown to be winning feel that chances are slim and that their vote is not required, thus allowing another candidate to win. For party-list proportional representation opinion polling helps voters avoid wasting their vote on a party below the electoral threshold.

In addition, Mark Pickup, in Cameron Anderson and Laura Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Voting Behaviour in Canada&quot;, outlines three additional &quot;behavioural&quot; responses that voters may exhibit when faced with polling data. The first is known as a &quot;cue taking&quot; effect which holds that poll data is used as a &quot;proxy&quot; for information about the candidates or parties. Cue taking is &quot;based on the psychological phenomenon of using heuristics to simplify a complex decision&quot; (243).

The second, first described by Petty and Cacioppo (1996), is known as &quot;cognitive response&quot; theory. This theory asserts that a voter&#x27;s response to a poll may not line with their initial conception of the electoral reality. In response, the voter is likely to generate a &quot;mental list&quot; in which they create reasons for a party&#x27;s loss or gain in the polls. This can reinforce or change their opinion of the candidate and thus affect voting behaviour. Third, the final possibility is a &quot;behavioural response&quot; which is similar to a cognitive response. The only salient difference is that a voter will go and seek new information to form their &quot;mental list&quot;, thus becoming more informed of the election. This may then affect voting behaviour.

These effects indicate how opinion polls can directly affect political choices of the electorate. But directly or indirectly, other effects can be surveyed and analyzed on all political parties. The form of media framing and party ideology shifts must also be taken under consideration. Opinion polling in some instances is a measure of cognitive bias, which is variably considered and handled appropriately in its various applications. In turn, non-nuanced reporting by the media about poll data and public opinions can thus even aggravate political polarization.

=== Effect on politicians ===

Starting in the 1980s, tracking polls and related technologies began having a notable impact on U.S. political leaders. According to Douglas Bailey, a Republican who had helped run Gerald Ford&#x27;s 1976 presidential campaign, &quot;It&#x27;s no longer necessary for a political candidate to guess what an audience thinks. He can [find out] with a nightly tracking poll. So it&#x27;s no longer likely that political leaders are going to lead. Instead, they&#x27;re going to follow.&quot;

== Regulation ==
Some jurisdictions over the world restrict the publication of the results of opinion polls, especially during the period around an election, in order to prevent the possibly erroneous results from affecting voters&#x27; decisions. For instance, in Canada, it is prohibited to publish the results of opinion surveys that would identify specific political parties or candidates in the final three days before a poll closes.

However, most Western democratic nations do not support the entire prohibition of the publication of pre-election opinion polls; most of them have no regulation and some only prohibit it in the final days or hours until the relevant poll closes. A survey by Canada&#x27;s Royal Commission on Electoral Reform reported that the prohibition period of publication of the survey results largely differed in different countries. Out of the 20 countries examined, 3 prohibit the publication during the entire period of campaigns, while others prohibit it for a shorter term such as the polling period or the final 48 hours before a poll closes. In India, the Election Commission has prohibited it in the 48 hours before the start of polling.

== Opinion poll in dictatorships ==
The director of the Levada Center stated in 2015 that drawing conclusions from Russian poll results or comparing them to polls in democratic states was irrelevant, as there is no real political competition in Russia, where, unlike in democratic states, Russian voters are not offered any credible alternatives and public opinion is primarily formed by state-controlled media, which promotes those in power and discredits alternative candidates. Many respondents in Russia do not want to answer pollsters&#x27; questions for fear of negative consequences. On 23 March 2023, criminal case was opened against Moscow resident Yury Kokhovets, a participant in the Radio Liberty street poll. He faced up to 10 years in prison under Russia&#x27;s 2022 war censorship laws.

<text>John Webster (c. 1578 – c. 1632) was an English Jacobean dramatist best known for his tragedies &quot;The White Devil&quot; and &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;, which are often seen as masterpieces of the early 17th-century English stage. His life and career overlapped with Shakespeare&#x27;s.

==Biography==
Webster&#x27;s life is obscure and the dates of his birth and death are not known. His father, a carriage maker also named John Webster, married a blacksmith&#x27;s daughter named Elizabeth Coates on 4 November 1577 and it is likely that Webster was born not long after, in or near London. The family lived in St Sepulchre&#x27;s parish. His father John and uncle Edward were Freemen of the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company and Webster attended Merchant Taylors&#x27; School in Suffolk Lane, London. On 1 August 1598, &quot;John Webster, lately of the New Inn&quot; was admitted to the Middle Temple, one of the Inns of Court; in view of the legal interests evident in his dramatic work, this may be the playwright. Webster married 17-year-old Sara Peniall on 18 March 1605 at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Islington. A special licence was needed to permit a wedding in Lent, as Sara was seven months pregnant. Their first child, John Webster III, was baptised at the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-West on 8 March 1606. Bequests in the will of a neighbour who died in 1617, indicate that other children were born to him.

Most of what is otherwise known of him relates to his theatrical activities. Webster was still writing plays in the mid-1620s, but Thomas Heywood&#x27;s &quot;Hierarchie of the Blessed Angels&quot; (licensed 7 November 1634) speaks of him in the past tense, implying he was then dead.

There is no known portrait of Webster.

===Early collaboration ===
By 1602, Webster was working with teams of playwrights on history plays, most of which were never printed. They included a tragedy, &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Fall&quot; (written with Michael Drayton, Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton and Anthony Munday), and a collaboration with Dekker, &quot;Christmas Comes but Once a Year&quot; (1602). With Dekker he also wrote &quot;Sir Thomas Wyatt&quot;, which was printed in 1607 and had probably been first performed in 1602. He worked with Dekker again on two city comedies, &quot;Westward Ho&quot; in 1604 and &quot;Northward Ho&quot; in 1605. Also in 1604, he adapted John Marston&#x27;s &quot;The Malcontent&quot; for staging by the King&#x27;s Men.

===The major tragedies===

Despite his ability to write comedy, Webster is best known for two brooding English tragedies based on Italian sources. &quot;The White Devil&quot;, a retelling of the intrigues involving Vittoria Accoramboni, an Italian woman assassinated at the age of 28, was a failure when staged at the Red Bull Theatre in 1612 (published the same year) being too unusual and intellectual for its audience. &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;, first performed by the King&#x27;s Men about 1614 and published nine years later, was more successful. He also wrote a play called &quot;Guise&quot;, based on French history, of which little else is known, as no text has survived.

&quot;The White Devil&quot; was performed in the Red Bull Theatre, an open-air theatre that is believed to have specialised in providing simple, escapist drama for a largely working-class audience, a factor that might explain why Webster&#x27;s intellectual and complex play was unpopular with its audience. In contrast, &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; was probably performed by the King&#x27;s Men in the smaller, indoor Blackfriars Theatre, where it might have been appreciated by a better educated audience. The two plays would thus have been played very differently: &quot;The White Devil&quot; by adult actors, probably in continuous action, with elaborate stage effects a possibility, and &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; in a controlled environment, with artificial lighting and musical interludes between acts, which allowed time, perhaps, for the audience to accept the otherwise strange rapidity with which the Duchess could have babies.

===Late plays===
Webster wrote one more play on his own: &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Law Case&quot; (c. 1617–1619), a tragicomedy. His later plays were collaborative city comedies: &quot;Anything for a Quiet Life&quot; () co-written with Thomas Middleton and &quot;A Cure for a Cuckold&quot; (c. 1624) co-written with William Rowley. In 1624, he also co-wrote a topical play about a recent scandal, &quot;Keep the Widow Waking&quot; (with John Ford, Rowley and Dekker). The play is lost, but its plot is known from a court case. He is believed to have contributed to the tragicomedy &quot;The Fair Maid of the Inn&quot; with John Fletcher, Ford and Phillip Massinger. His &quot;Appius and Virginia&quot;, probably written with Thomas Heywood, is of uncertain date.

==Reputation==
Webster&#x27;s intricate, complex, subtle and learned plays are difficult, but rewarding and are still frequently staged. Webster has gained a reputation as the Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatist with the most unsparingly dark vision of human nature. Even more than John Ford, whose &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot; is also bleak, Webster&#x27;s tragedies present a horrific vision of humanity. In his poem &quot;Whispers of Immortality&quot;, T. S. Eliot memorably says that Webster always saw &quot;the skull beneath the skin&quot;.

Webster&#x27;s title character in &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; is presented as a figure of virtue compared with her malevolent brothers. She faces death with classic Stoic courage in a martyr-like scene which has been compared to that of the king in Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s play &quot;Edward II&quot;. Webster&#x27;s use of a strong, virtuous woman as his main character was rare for his time and marks a deliberate reworking of some of the original historical events on which the play was based. The character of the Duchess recalls the Victorian poet and essayist Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s comment in &quot;A Study of Shakespeare&quot; that in tragedies such as &quot;King Lear&quot; Shakespeare had shown such a bleak world as a foil or backdrop for virtuous heroines such as Ophelia and Imogen, so that their characterisation would not seem too incredible. Swinburne describes such heroines as shining in the darkness.

Webster&#x27;s drama was generally dismissed in the 18th and 19th centuries, but many 20th-century critics and theatregoers have found &quot;The White Devil&quot; and &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; brilliant plays of great poetic quality. One explanation for the change of view is that the horrors of war in the early 20th century had led to desperate protagonists being on stage again and understood. W. A. Edwards wrote of Webster&#x27;s plays in &quot;Scrutiny&quot; II (1933–1934) &quot;Events are not within control, nor are our human desires; let&#x27;s snatch what comes and clutch it, fight our way out of tight corners, and meet the end without squealing.&quot; The violence and pessimism of the tragedies have seemed to some analysts close to modern sensibilities.

==Webster in other works==
*The 18th-century play &quot;The Fatal Secret&quot; by Lewis Theobald is a reworking of &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;, imposing Aristotle&#x27;s &#x27;unities&#x27; and a happy ending on the plot.
*The short story &#x27;A Christmas in Padua&#x27; in F. L. Lucas&#x27;s &quot;The Woman Clothed with the Sun&quot; (1937) retells the final hours in December 1585 of Vittoria Accoramboni (the original of Webster&#x27;s &quot;White Devil&quot;), slanting the narrative from her perspective.
*The 1982 detective novel &quot;The Skull Beneath the Skin&quot; by P. D. James centres on an ageing actress who plans to play Webster&#x27;s drama &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; in a Victorian castle theatre. The novel takes its title from T. S. Eliot&#x27;s famous characterisation of Webster&#x27;s work in his poem &#x27;Whispers of Immortality&#x27;.
*&quot;Webster&quot;, a play by Robert David McDonald, was written for and premièred at the Glasgow Citizens Theatre, 1984.
*A young John Webster, played by Joe Roberts, appears in the 1998 film &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;. When talking to Will Shakespeare he tells him, &quot;When I write plays they&#x27;ll be like &quot;Titus&quot;... plenty of blood – that&#x27;s the only writing.&quot; The scene alludes to the real John Webster&#x27;s macabre work. He is also the character who reveals Viola&#x27;s disguise, after watching Viola and Shakespeare making love in the theatre.
*A fragment of Act Four, Scene Two, of &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; is shown in the 1987 BBC TV film version of Agatha Christie&#x27;s detective novel &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;.
*Webster&#x27;s line, &quot;Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle: she died young&quot;, is used in the novel &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; by Anne Rice, and in &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;.
*Mike Figgis&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Hotel&quot; involves scenes from &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;.
*The antagonist in Paul Johnston&#x27;s &#x27;The Death List&#x27; and &#x27;The Soul Collector&#x27; mimics &quot;The White Devil&quot; in character-names and actions.
*In Episode 11, Season 2 of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, &quot;The White Devil&quot; is discussed in a Princeton classroom during a scene that takes place in Jimmy Darmody&#x27;s past. At the end of the scene the teacher quotes the line &quot;What, because we are poor shall we be vicious?&quot; to which Jimmy responds &quot;Pray what means have you to keep me from the galleys, or the gallows?&quot; Later in the episode, the teacher refers to Jimmy&#x27;s life as Jacobean.
*Webster and his works &quot;The White Devil&quot; and &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; are mentioned in the lyrics to the song &quot;My White Devil&quot; by Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, included on their 1983 album &quot;Porcupine&quot;.

<doc id="277318" wikidata="Q236253" url="?curid=277318" title="Kate Jackson">
<text>Lucy Kate Jackson (born October 29, 1948), known professionally as Kate Jackson, is an American actress and television producer, known for her television roles as Sabrina Duncan in the series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1976–1979) and Amanda King in the series &quot;Scarecrow and Mrs. King&quot; (1983–1987). Her film roles include &quot;Making Love&quot; (1982) and &quot;Loverboy&quot; (1989). She is a three-time Emmy Award nominee and four-time Golden Globe Award nominee, and Photoplay (magazine) award winner for &quot;Favorite TV Actress&quot; 1978.

Jackson began her career in the late 1960s in summer stock, before landing major television roles in &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (1970–71), &quot;Bonanza&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Rookies&quot; (1972–1976). She also appeared in the film &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot; (1971). The huge success of her role as Sabrina Duncan on &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; saw her appear on the front cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, alongside co-stars Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith, while her role as Mrs. King won her Germany&#x27;s Bravo Golden Otto Award for Best Female TV Star three times (1986–1988). She then continued to star in numerous television films, including &quot;Quiet Killer&quot; (1992), &quot;Empty Cradle&quot; (1993) and &quot;Satan&#x27;s School for Girls&quot; (2000), a remake of the 1973 TV film of the same name in which she also starred.

==Early life and career==
Jackson was born in Birmingham, Alabama, the daughter of Ruth (née Shepherd) and Hogan Jackson, a business executive. She attended The Brooke Hill School for Girls while residing in Mountain Brook. Jackson went on to enroll at the University of Mississippi as a history major where she was a member of the Delta Rho chapter of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. Halfway through her sophomore year, she transferred to Birmingham–Southern College, a liberal arts college, taking classes in speech and history of the theatre. At the end of the academic year, Jackson became an apprentice at the Stowe Playhouse in Stowe, Vermont, and then moved to New York City to study acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

Initially, Jackson worked as an NBC page and tour guide at the network&#x27;s Rockefeller Center before landing a role as the mysterious, silent ghost Daphne Harridge on the 1960s supernatural daytime soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. In 1971, Jackson had a starring role as Tracy Collins in &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot;, the second feature film based on the daytime serial. This film was more loosely based on the series than the first feature film, and it did not fare as well at the box office. The same year, she appeared in two episodes of the short-lived sitcom &quot;The Jimmy Stewart Show&quot;.

She then appeared as nurse Jill Danko for four seasons on the 1970s crime drama &quot;The Rookies&quot;. A supporting cast member, Jackson filled her free time by studying directing and editing. She also appeared in several TV films during this period. Jackson&#x27;s performance was well received in the 1972 independent film &quot;Limbo&quot;, one of the first theatrical films to address the Vietnam War and the wives of soldiers who were POWs, MIA or killed in action. She also appeared in &quot;Death Scream&quot;, a 1975 television dramatization of the circumstances surrounding the 1964 murder of Kitty Genovese.

==Career==

In 1975, Jackson met with &quot;Rookies&quot; producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg to discuss her contractual obligation to star in another television series for Spelling/Goldberg Productions upon that show&#x27;s cancellation. Goldberg told her of a series that was available—because &quot;every network has passed on it,&quot; &quot;The Alley Cats&quot;. Spelling said that when he told Jackson the title of the series had to be changed and asked her what she would like to call it, she replied &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels,&quot; pointing to a picture of three female angels on the wall behind Spelling. Jackson was originally cast as Kelly Garrett (which ultimately went to her co-star Jaclyn Smith), but decided upon Sabrina Duncan instead. The huge success of the show saw Jackson, Smith and Farrah Fawcett-Majors (who played Jill Munroe) appear on the front cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. The show aired as a television film on March 21, 1976, before debuting as a series on September 22, 1976. Because Jackson was considered the star of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; following her experience and four years on &quot;The Rookies&quot;, her original role of Kelly Garrett was featured prominently in the pilot film.

Jackson hosted the thirteenth episode of season four of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; which aired in February 1979. During her monologue, she referred to being an NBC page ten years earlier where she led tours of the studio. At the beginning of the third season of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, Jackson was offered the Meryl Streep role in the feature film &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; (1979), but was forced to turn it down because Spelling told her that the show&#x27;s shooting schedule could not be rearranged to give her time to do the film. At the end of the third season, Jackson left the show saying, &quot;I served it well and it served me well, now it&#x27;s time to go.&quot; Spelling cast Shelley Hack as her replacement.
Jackson starred alongside Harry Hamlin and her &quot;Rookies&quot; co-star Michael Ontkean in the feature film &quot;Making Love&quot; (1982), directed by Arthur Hiller. It was a film some considered to be ahead of its time, and attempted to deal sensitively with the topic of homosexuality. However, it received tepid reviews and did poorly at the box office.

In 1983, Jackson had a starring role in &quot;Scarecrow and Mrs. King&quot;, a one-hour action drama in which she played housewife Amanda King opposite Bruce Boxleitner&#x27;s spy, code-named &quot;Scarecrow.&quot; Jackson also co-produced the series with Warner Brothers Television through her production company, Shoot the Moon Enterprises. During this time she developed an interest in directing. &quot;Scarecrow and Mrs. King&quot; aired for four seasons from 1983 to 1987.

During filming of the show&#x27;s fourth season, in January 1987, Jackson had a mammogram for the first time, which found a small malignant tumor. Her series&#x27; producer—the only person she told about the diagnosis—rescheduled her work on the show. She checked in to a hospital under an alias to have a lumpectomy. Jackson returned to the series a week later, working with the aid of painkillers through five weeks of radiation treatments.

After undergoing breast cancer treatment, Jackson followed up on &quot;Scarecrow and Mrs. King&quot; by taking on the main role in &quot;Baby Boom&quot;, a 1988 TV sitcom version of a 1987 film of the same name. The series lasted less than one season, canceled with episodes left unaired.

In 1989, Jackson starred in the film &quot;Loverboy&quot;, directed by Joan Micklin Silver.

In September 1989, another mammogram indicated residual breast cancer that the previous operation had missed. Jackson had a partial mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; colleague Jaclyn Smith made statements indicating her support of Jackson.

In 1995, Jackson was diagnosed as having been born with an atrial septal defect that had previously gone undetected. Jackson underwent open-heart surgery to correct the defect.

Jackson spoke publicly about breast cancer and heart health and received the &quot;Power of Love&quot; award in 2003 from the American Heart Association for raising awareness among the public regarding those issues.

In 2004, the television film &quot;Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; aired, with actress Lauren Stamile portraying Jackson. In August 2006, Jackson, Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith, the three original Angels, made a surprise appearance together at the &quot;58th Primetime Emmy Awards&quot; in a tribute to the recently deceased &quot;Angels&quot; creator Aaron Spelling.

In 2007, Jackson played the mother of FBI agent Emily Prentiss on &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, her last acting role to date. In August 2008, she was a guest judge on an episode of Jaclyn Smith&#x27;s Bravo reality series &quot;Shear Genius&quot;, presiding over a hairdressing competition to update the original trio&#x27;s signature hairdos.

On August 3, 2010, Gallery Books announced a contract with Jackson to publish her memoirs. The book, expected in 2011, has been repeatedly delayed, with the latest update reporting a scheduled release for two days before 2021.

She has not appeared in film or television since 2009.

==Personal life==
Jackson lived with, and was engaged to, actor Edward Albert in the mid-1970s. She was then linked romantically to producer Robert Evans, stuntman Gary Quist and actors Dirk Benedict, Nick Nolte and Warren Beatty. After a six-month courtship, Jackson married actor Andrew Stevens (the son of actress Stella Stevens) in August 1978. The couple divorced in 1981. After her divorce from Stevens, Jackson said, &quot;I felt as if my ex-husband drove up to my bank account with a Brink&#x27;s truck.&quot; Jackson was then linked with actor Gary Pendergast and screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz. She married New York businessman David Greenwald in 1982, and they formed &#x27;Shoot The Moon Productions&#x27; together, the company that produced Jackson&#x27;s series &quot;Scarecrow and Mrs. King&quot;. The couple divorced in 1984.

After the divorce, Jackson was frequently seen with dermatologist Arnold Klein. While recovering from her second bout with breast cancer and on vacation in Aspen, Colorado, in 1989, Jackson met Tom Hart, the owner of a Utah ski lodge, and the pair married in 1991. The couple lived both in Los Angeles and Park City, Utah. Jackson and Hart divorced in 1993. In 1995, Jackson adopted a son.

In May 2010, Jackson sued her financial advisor, Richard B. Francis, claiming his actions cost her more than $3 million ($ million today) and brought her to financial ruin. The parties reached an undisclosed settlement in December 2010.

In August 2023, after many years out of the public eye, Jackson appeared as a guest at a wedding hosted by Jaclyn Smith for Smith&#x27;s son Gaston in Los Angeles.

<doc id="277319" wikidata="Q2111313" url="?curid=277319" title="Tulip Time Festival">
<text>Tulip Time Festival is an annual festival held in Holland, Michigan. Tulip festivals are held in many cities around the United States of America that were founded or largely inhabited by Dutch settlers. It has been held every year (except 2020) in mid-May since 1929 and is currently the longest running tulip festival in the United States. The festival currently runs from the first Saturday in May through the second Sunday.

Activities at the celebration include three parades, fireworks, a Dutch Market, various shows and concerts, a craft fair, klompen dancing, and street scrubbing. The city of Holland has thousands of tulips lining the streets and in special tulip gardens throughout the city. 

==History==
Tulip Time&#x27;s roots can be traced to a 1927 community beautification project. Lida Rogers, a biology teacher at Holland High School, suggested Holland adopt the tulip as its flower due to the city&#x27;s close ties to The Netherlands.

In 1928, City council approved funding to import 100,000 tulip bulbs from the Netherlands and plant them in city parks. The next year, the city invited visitors to come during the week including May 15. The success prompted an annual event to be born. During World War II, Tulip Time was scaled back, returning with a four-day festival in 1946.

The 1947 festival was geared towards celebrating Holland, Michigan&#x27;s centennial. A tradition was started that year when Michigan&#x27;s governor, Kim Sigler, donned a Dutch costume and took part in the festivities. As America celebrated its bicentennial in 1976, Tulip Time was honored with the presence of President Gerald R. Ford, a Michigander who had formerly represented nearby Grand Rapids in the United States Congress.

The reconstruction of the authentic 200-year-old &quot;De Zwaan&quot; windmill on Windmill Island in 1965 added another tourist attraction.

In 1991, Tulip Time expanded from four to ten days. In 2001, the festival was shortened to eight days and moved up a week to better coincide with when the tulips were in bloom. A carnival was added in 2003.

In 2008, the outdoor concert series, renamed Tulipalooza, was moved to the Sixth Street Stage at 6th street and College Ave.

The 2020 festival was canceled for the first time due to the COVID-19 crisis. In 2021 the festival was resumed virtually, and in 2022 the festival returned to in-person activities.

It was also featured in the 1942 film &quot;Seven Sweethearts&quot;.

<doc id="277321" wikidata="Q336189" url="?curid=277321" title="Thomas Dekker (writer)">
<text>Thomas Dekker ( – 25 August 1632) was an English Elizabethan dramatist and pamphleteer, a versatile and prolific writer, whose career spanned several decades and brought him into contact with many of the period&#x27;s most famous dramatists.

==Early life==
Little is known of Dekker&#x27;s early life or origins. From references in his pamphlets, Dekker is believed to have been born in London around 1572, but nothing is known for certain about his youth. His last name suggests Dutch ancestry, and his work, some of which is translated from Latin, suggests that he attended grammar school.

==Career==
Dekker embarked on a career as a theatre writer in the middle 1590s. His handwriting is found in the manuscript of &quot;Sir Thomas More&quot;, though the date of his involvement is undetermined. More certain is his work as a playwright for the Admiral&#x27;s Men of Philip Henslowe, in whose account book he is first mentioned in early 1598. While there are plays connected with his name performed as early as 1594, it is not clear that he was the original author; his work often involved revision and updating. Between 1598 and 1602, he was involved in about forty plays for Henslowe, usually in collaboration. To these years belong the collaborations with Ben Jonson and John Marston, which presumably contributed to the War of the Theatres in 1600 and 1601. But Dekker is credited as the sole author of &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1599), his acknowledged masterpiece – a boisterous, rowdy comedy of London life as seen through the eyes of a romanticist. Francis Meres includes Dekker in his list of notable playwrights in 1598.

For Jonson, however, Dekker was a bumbling hack, a &quot;dresser of plays about town&quot;; Jonson lampooned Dekker as Demetrius Fannius in &quot;Poetaster&quot; and as Anaides in &quot;Cynthia&#x27;s Revels&quot;. Dekker&#x27;s riposte, &quot;Satiromastix&quot;, performed both by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men and the child actors of Paul&#x27;s, casts Jonson as an affected, hypocritical Horace.

&quot;Satiromastix&quot; marks the end of the &quot;poetomachia&quot;; in 1603, Jonson and Dekker collaborated again, on a pageant for the Royal Entry, delayed from the coronation of James I, for which Dekker also wrote the festival book &quot;The Magnificent Entertainment&quot;. After this commission, however, the early Jacobean period was notably mixed for the author. In late 1602, he appears to have broken his association with Henslowe, for unknown reasons. He wrote for Worcester&#x27;s Men for a time, then returned to the Admiral&#x27;s Men (now patronized by Prince Henry) to produce &quot;The Honest Whore&quot;, an apparent success. But the failures of &quot;The Whore of Babylon&quot; (1607) and &quot;If This Be Not a Good Play, the Devil is in It&quot; (1611) left him crestfallen; the latter play was rejected by Prince Henry&#x27;s Men before failing for Queen Anne&#x27;s Men at the Red Bull Theatre.

==Legal troubles==
In 1612, Dekker&#x27;s lifelong problem with debt (he had earlier, 1599, been imprisoned in Poultry Compter) reached a crisis when he was imprisoned in the King&#x27;s Bench Prison on a debt of forty pounds to the father of John Webster. He remained there for seven years, and despite the support of associates such as Edward Alleyn and Endymion Porter, these years were difficult; Dekker reports that the experience turned his hair white. He continued as pamphleteer throughout his years in prison.

==Later years==
On release, he resumed writing plays, now with collaborators both from his generation (John Day and John Webster) and slightly younger writers (John Ford and Philip Massinger). Among these plays is one, &quot;Keep the Widow Waking&quot; (1624, with Ford, Webster, and William Rowley), which dramatized two recent murders in Whitechapel. In the latter half of the decade, Dekker turned once more to pamphlet-writing, revamping old work and writing a new preface to his most popular tract, &quot;The Bellman of London&quot;.

==Death==
Dekker died in 25 August 1632 and was buried at St James&#x27;s Church, Clerkenwell.

When Dekker began writing plays, Thomas Nashe and Thomas Lodge were still alive; when he died, John Dryden had already been born. Like most dramatists of the period, he adapted as well as he could to changing tastes; however, even his work in the fashionable Jacobean genres of satire and tragicomedy bears the marks of his Elizabethan training: its humour is genial, its action romantic. The majority of his surviving plays are comedies or tragicomedies.
Most of Dekker&#x27;s work is lost. His apparently disordered life, and his lack of a firm connection (such as Shakespeare or Fletcher had) with a single company, may have militated against the preservation or publication of manuscripts. Close to twenty of his plays were published during his lifetime; of these, more than half are comedies, with three significant tragedies: &quot;Lust&#x27;s Dominion&quot; (presumably identical to &quot;The Spanish Moor&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, written with Day, Marston, and William Haughton, 1600), &quot;The Witch of Edmonton&quot; (with Ford and Rowley, 1621), and &quot;The Virgin Martyr&quot; (with Massinger, 1620).

The first phase of Dekker&#x27;s career is documented in Henslowe&#x27;s diary. His name appears for the first time in connection with &quot;fayeton&quot; (presumably, Phaeton) in 1598. There follow, before 1599, payments for work on &quot;The Triplicity of Cuckolds&quot;, &quot;The Mad Man&#x27;s Morris&quot;, and &quot;Hannibal and Hermes&quot;. He worked on these plays with Robert Wilson, Henry Chettle, and Michael Drayton. With Drayton, he also worked on history plays on the French civil wars, Earl Godwin, and others. In 1599, he wrote plays on Troilus and Cressida, Agamemnon (with Chettle), and &quot;Page of Plymouth&quot;. In that year, also, he collaborated with Chettle, Jonson, and Marston on a play about Robert II. 1599 also saw the production of three plays that have survived. It was during this year that he produced his most famous work, &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday, or the Gentle Craft&quot;, categorised by modern critics as citizen comedy. This play reflects his concerns with the daily lives of ordinary Londoners, and contains the poem The Merry Month of May. This play exemplifies his intermingling of everyday subjects with the fantastical, embodied in this case by the rise of a craftsman to Mayor and the involvement of an unnamed but idealised king in the concluding banquet. &quot;Old Fortunatus&quot; and &quot;Patient Grissel&quot;, the latter on the folkloric theme treated by Chaucer in The Clerk&#x27;s Tale. In 1600, he worked on &quot;The Seven Wise Masters&quot;, &quot;Fortune&#x27;s Tennis&quot;, &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot;, and &quot;Fair Constance of Rome&quot;. The next year, in addition to &quot;Satiromastix&quot;, he worked on a play possibly about Sebastian of Portugal and &quot;Blurt, Master Constable&quot;, on which he may have worked with Thomas Middleton. In 1602 he revised two older plays, &quot;Pontius Pilate&quot; (1597) and the second part of &quot;Sir John Oldcastle&quot;. He also collaborated on &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Fall&quot;, &quot;Jephthah&quot;, &quot;A Medicine for a Curst Wife&quot;, &quot;Sir Thomas Wyatt&quot; (on Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion), and &quot;Christmas Comes But Once a Year&quot;.

Except for &quot;Blurt&quot;, which was performed by the Blackfriars Children, the earlier of these works were performed at the Admiral&#x27;s Fortune Theatre. After 1602, Dekker split his attention between pamphlets and plays; thus, his dramatic output decreased considerably. He and Middleton wrote &quot;The Honest Whore&quot; for the Fortune in 1604, and Dekker wrote a sequel himself the following year. The Middleton/Dekker collaboration &quot;The Family of Love&quot; also dates from this general era. Dekker and Webster wrote &quot;Westward Ho&quot; and &quot;Northward Ho&quot; for Paul&#x27;s Boys. The failures of the anti-Catholic &quot;Whore of Babylon&quot; and tragicomic &quot;If This Be Not...&quot; have already been noted. &quot;The Roaring Girl&quot;, a city comedy that incorporates the real-life contemporary figure &#x27;Moll Cutpurse&#x27;, otherwise known as Mary Frith, was a collaboration with Middleton in 1611. In the same year, he also wrote another tragicomedy called &quot;Match Me in London&quot;.

During his imprisonment, Dekker did not write plays. After his release, he collaborated with Day on &quot;Guy of Warwick&quot; (1620), &quot;The Wonder of a Kingdom&quot; (1623), and &quot;The Bellman of Paris&quot; (1623). With Ford, he wrote &quot;The Sun&#x27;s Darling&quot; (1624), &quot;The Fairy Knight&quot; (1624), and &quot;The Bristow Merchant&quot; (1624). He also wrote the tragicomedy &quot;The Noble Spanish Soldier&quot; (1622) and later reworked material from this play into a comedic form to produce &quot;The Welsh Ambassador&quot; (1623). Another play, &quot;The Late Murder of the Son upon the Mother, or Keep the Widow Waking&quot;, a dramatization of two recent murders in Whitechapel, occasioned a suit for slander heard in the Star Chamber. That play is lost.

Dekker&#x27;s plays of the 1620s were staged at the large amphitheatres on the north side of London, most commonly at the Red Bull; only two of his later plays were seen at the more exclusive, indoor Cockpit Theatre, and these two were presumably produced by Christopher Beeston, who operated both the Red Bull and the Cockpit. By the 1620s, the Shoreditch amphitheaters had become deeply identified with the louder and less reputable categories of play-goers, such as apprentices. Dekker&#x27;s type of play appears to have suited them perfectly. Full of bold action, careless about generic differences, and always (in the end) complementary to the values and beliefs of such audiences, his drama carried some of the vigorous optimism of Elizabethan dramaturgy into the Caroline era.

===Prose===
He exhibited a similar vigour in his pamphlets, which span almost his whole writing career, and which treat a great variety of subjects and styles.

Dekker&#x27;s first spate of pamphleteering began in 1603, perhaps during a period when plague had closed the theaters. His first was &quot;The Wonderfull Yeare&quot;, a journalistic account of the death of Elizabeth, accession of James I, and the 1603 plague, that combined a wide variety of literary genres in an attempt to convey the extraordinary events of that year (&#x27;wonderful&#x27; meaning astonishing, not excellent). It succeeded well enough to prompt two more plague pamphlets, &quot;News From Gravesend&quot; and &quot;The Meeting of Gallants at an Ordinary&quot;. &quot;The Double PP&quot; (1606) is an anti-Catholic tract written in response to the Gunpowder Plot. &quot;News From Hell&quot; (1606) is an homage to and continuation of Nash&#x27;s &quot;Pierce Penniless&quot;. &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins of London&quot; (1606) is another plague pamphlet.

After 1608, Dekker produced his most popular pamphlets: a series of &quot;cony-catching&quot; pamphlets that described the various tricks and deceits of confidence-men and thieves, including thieves&#x27; cant. These pamphlets, which Dekker often updated and reissued, include &quot;The Belman of London&quot; (1608, now &quot;The Bellman of London&quot;), &quot;Lanthorne and Candle-light&quot;, &quot;Villainies Discovered by Candlelight&quot;, and &quot;English Villainies&quot;. They owe their form and many of their incidents to similar pamphlets by Robert Greene.

Other pamphlets are journalistic in form and offer vivid pictures of Jacobean London. &quot;The Dead Term&quot; (1608) describes Westminster during summer vacation. &quot;The Guls Horne-Booke&quot; (1609, now &quot;The Gull&#x27;s Hornbook&quot;) describes the life of city gallants, including a valuable account of behaviour in the London theatres. &quot;Work for Armourers&quot; (1609) and &quot;The Artillery Garden&quot; (1616) (the latter in verse) describe aspects of England&#x27;s military industries. &quot;London Look Back&quot; (1630) treats 1625, the year of James&#x27;s death, while &quot;Wars, Wars, Wars&quot; (1628) describes European turmoil.

As might be expected, Dekker turned his experience in prison to profitable account. &quot;Dekker His Dreame&quot; (1620) is a long poem describing his despairing confinement; he contributed six prison-based sketches to the sixth edition (1616) of Sir Thomas Overbury&#x27;s &quot;Characters&quot;; and he revised &quot;Lanthorne and Candlelight&quot; to reflect what he had learned in prison.

Dekker&#x27;s pamphlets, even more than his plays, reveal signs of hasty and careless composition. Yet the best of them can still entertain, and almost all of them offer valuably precise depictions of everyday life in the Jacobean period.

Dekker&#x27;s poetry entered into modern popular song (although almost unnoticeably) when some of the lyrics of the poem &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;, from Dekker&#x27;s play &quot;Patient Grissel&quot;, were included by Paul McCartney in the Beatles&#x27; 1969 song &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;.

<doc id="277322" wikidata="Q2038142" url="?curid=277322" title="Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund">
<text>The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund was an independent grant-giving foundation established in September 1997 after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, to continue her humanitarian work in the United Kingdom and overseas. It was a registered charity under English law. The Fund closed at the end of 2012.

==Establishment and funding==
The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund (&#x27;the Fund&#x27;) was established within days of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, on 31 August 1997, in response to the donations that poured into Kensington Palace. The general public, community groups and companies donated £34 million. £38 million was donated from sales of Elton John and PolyGram&#x27;s CD of &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot;. A further £66 million were subsequently raised through investments, an eight-year programme of commercial partnerships, and proceeds from the exhibition, &quot;Diana: A Celebration&quot;, donated by Lord Spencer.

==Mission and activities==
During its fifteen years of operation, the Fund worked to secure sustainable improvements in the lives of the most disadvantaged people in the UK and around the world by giving grants, championing causes and lending the Fund&#x27;s name and profile to charitable causes.

For its first ten years, 1997–2006, the Fund was largely a criteria-led grantmaker. Grant programmes were devised and developed on an annual basis and were open to any eligible organisation that wished to apply. During this period, the Fund spent over £60 million on helping improve the lives of displaced people, people at the margins of society, survivors of conflict and those who were dying or bereaved.

In 2006, following a consultation with the voluntary sector and a period of strategic review, the Fund decided that it would be most effective if its remaining capital was focused on a time-limited, targeted programme of work. The decision to cease operating within five-to-nine years was announced in 2007 at the launch of a new five-year Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan set out a number of proactive grantmaking programmes, called Initiatives, which were:

* The Palliative Care Initiative. 
* The Refugee and Asylum Seekers Initiative. 
* The Partnership Initiative, which in 2009, became two separate Initiatives: The Cluster Munitions Initiative and The Penal Reform Initiative.

Each Initiative set out to create sustainable change in their areas of focus by securing positive improvements in policy, practice and public attitudes. This systems-change approach was adopted both to establish a momentum for long-term social change and to ensure that any positive improvements secured would last for far longer that the Fund&#x27;s lifetime and continue to help future generations to come.

==The Palliative Care Initiative==
The Fund set up its Palliative Care Initiative in 2000 to work in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa – Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. By 2006, the Fund had awarded 60 grants totaling over £2.5 million to organisations working in palliative care in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2007, as part of the Fund&#x27;s 2007–2012 Strategic Plan, the Palliative Care Initiative committed to spend up to a further £10 million by 2012. The Palliative Care Initiative focused on:
* Helping to integrate palliative care into health policies.
* Working to ensure that palliative care was included as part of medical and nursing courses. 
* Supporting organisations who were able to make more children&#x27;s palliative care services available.

==The Refugee and Asylum Seekers Initiative==
Between 1999 and 2007, the Fund awarded over £6 million in grants to approximately 40 organisations for projects supporting young refugees and children and young people seeking asylum. The Fund pledged a further £10 million under its Strategic Plan 2007–2012 to support work aimed at ensuring that refugees and people seeking asylum in the UK are treated fairly, humanely and in accordance with international law. The Refugee and Asylum Seekers Initiative focused on:
* Supporting advocacy and campaigning activities aimed at improving the lives of all those arriving in the UK to seek protection from persecution.
* Initiating a collaboration of foundations working to ensure a more balanced public debate on migration and asylum issues.
* Supporting organisations working with refugee children and young people seeking asylum to help ensure adequate care and protection.
* Funding work to develop and increase specialised legal representation for children and young people seeking asylum.

The initiative attracted criticism from a number of individuals, including Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch UK, and Norman Tebbit.

==The Cluster Munitions Initiative==
In 2007, the Fund established the Cluster Munitions Initiative, which was initially the international arm of the Partnership Initiative, in order to build upon its previous support for the campaign against cluster munitions. The Cluster Munitions Initiative focused its resources on three areas of work: 
* Supporting the global campaign to ban cluster bombs.
* Supporting national campaigns to ban cluster bombs.
* Supporting the Ban Advocates Initiative – a group of ordinary civilians, all affected by cluster bombs, who came together from around the world to campaign for a worldwide ban.

==The Penal Reform Initiative==
The Penal Reform Initiative was established under the Fund&#x27;s 2007–2012 Strategic Plan in order to encourage the use of alternative solutions to imprisonment for two of the most vulnerable groups in custody – women and children and young people.

In 2007, the Fund gave a grant of over £1.5 million to the Prison Reform Trust to run &quot;Out of Trouble&quot;, a major five-year campaign to reduce the number of children and young people in custody.

Between 1997 and 2007, the women&#x27;s prison population more than doubled, and, as with children and young people, the vast majority were there for non-violent offences. In 2008, the Fund became a member of the Corston Independent Funders&#x27; Coalition (CIFC), a coalition of trusts, foundations and philanthropists set up to transform how disadvantaged women were treated by the criminal justice system.

==Closure==
In 2006, following a consultation with the voluntary sector and a period of strategic review, the Fund decided that it would be most effective if its remaining capital was focused on a time-limited, targeted programme of work aimed at creating sustainable improvements to the lives of disadvantaged people. The decision to close within five to nine years was announced in 2007 at the launch of a new five-year programme of work under its Strategic Plan 2007–2012.

On 31 December 2012, the Fund closed as a staffed, operational organisation, having successfully completed its programme of work aimed at improving the lives of the most disadvantaged people in the UK and around the world.

As an unincorporated trust, the Fund, as a matter of law, could not altogether cease to exist when it closed its doors on 31 December 2012. This meant that the Fund would automatically continue to receive future donations. The Directors of the Fund&#x27;s Trustee Company were keen to ensure that if any money was donated to the Fund after its operations had ceased they would not be lost to charity and instead would continue to make a positive difference to people&#x27;s lives.

In March 2013, The Royal Foundation became the legal owner of the Fund in order to safeguard the Fund&#x27;s name and any further income donated to the Fund in the future.

In July 2020, it was reported that the money from the memorial fund was divided between Princes William and Harry and given to their independent charities.

==Legal issues with Franklin Mint==
In 1998, the Fund refused Franklin Mint a licence to produce Diana memorabilia, but the Mint went ahead and produced Diana merchandise anyway. The Fund sued in 2002 and lost the case because in the California courts right of publicity may only be filed on behalf of a dead person who is a Californian. Upon losing the case, the Fund was required to pay the Franklin Mint&#x27;s legal costs of £3 million which, combined with other fees, caused the Memorial Fund to freeze its grants to charities. The costs to the Fund were nearly £4 million (US$6.5 million). Franklin Mint counter-sued, on grounds of malicious prosecution, claiming exemplary and punitive damages and seeking $14 million. Consequently, the Fund announced in 2003 it was &quot;legally obliged to freeze not only new grants but payment of existing grants&quot;. The case was settled out of court in 2004 with the Fund agreeing to pay £13.5 million (US$21.5 million). Franklin Mint stated, &quot;While the precise terms of the agreement are confidential, the goal is to release funds to excellent charitable causes which resonate with the memory of the princess&quot;. By agreement with Franklin Mint, the Fund was able to pledge £14m of grants over a period of five years.

<doc id="277323" wikidata="Q1148705" url="?curid=277323" title="Cyril Tourneur">
<text>Cyril Tourneur (; died 28 February 1626) was an English soldier, diplomat and dramatist who wrote &quot;The Atheist&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (published 1611); another (and better-known) play, &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (1607), formerly ascribed to him, is now more generally attributed to Thomas Middleton.

==Life==
Little is known of Cyril Tourneur&#x27;s early life. It has been suggested that he was either son of Edward Tournor of Canons, Great Parndon (Essex), or his grandson via Captain Richard Turnor, water-bailiff and subsequently lieutenant-governor of Brill in the Netherlands. However, the literary scholar Allardyce Nicoll concluded &quot;the evidence connecting him with the Turnors of Great Parndon is of the slightest&quot;, further observing that he had &quot;discovered not a shred of proof for associating him with any others of the numerous Turner families of this time. Turners, of course, abounded in the late sixteenth century as they abound to-day&quot;. Allardyce noted that the alleged connection of Cyril Tourneur with the Great Parndon family is not corroborated by that place&#x27;s official records. He served in his youth Sir Francis Vere and Sir Edward Cecil. His literary activities seem to be concentrated in the period 1600–1613. In 1613 and 1614 he was employed in military and diplomatic service in the Low Countries. In 1625 he was appointed to be secretary to the council of war for the Cádiz Expedition. This appointment was cancelled, but Tourneur sailed in Cecil&#x27;s company to Cádiz. On the return voyage from the disastrous expedition, he was put ashore at Kinsale with other sick men and died in Ireland on 28 February 1626.

==Writings==
A difficult allegorical poem called &quot;The Transformed Metamorphosis&quot; (1600) is Tourneur&#x27;s earliest extant work; an elegy on the death of Prince Henry, son of James I of England, is the latest (1613). Tourneur&#x27;s other non-dramatic works include a prose pamphlet, &quot;Laugh and Lie Down&quot; (1605), some contributions to Sir Thomas Overbury&#x27;s &quot;Book of Characters&quot; and an on Sir Francis Vere. This poem conveys the poet&#x27;s ideal conception of a perfect knight or happy warrior.

Tourneur&#x27;s primary dramatic work is &quot;The Atheist&#x27;s Tragedy, or The Honest Man&#x27;s Revenge&quot; which was published in 1611. A case has been made by Johan Gerritsen that Tourneur is the author of the first act of &quot;The Honest Man&#x27;s Fortune&quot; (1613), a play from the Beaumont &amp; Fletcher canon usually attributed to John Fletcher, Philip Massinger and Nathan Field. In addition there is a lost play, &quot;The Nobleman&quot;, and the lost &quot;Arraignment of London&quot; written with Robert Daborne. 

Tourneur&#x27;s current reputation however rests on &quot;The Atheist&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;. It confidently reproduces themes and conventions which are characteristic of medieval morality plays and of Elizabethan &quot;memento mori&quot; emblems. It uses these conventions in the context of Calvin&#x27;s Protestant theology. This and Tourneur&#x27;s other uncontested works, show him to be &quot;a traditional Christian moralist, with a consistent didactic bent.&quot; The play recalls Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Alchemist&quot; and &quot;Volpone&quot; in the character of Languebeau Snuffe, and may also be a response to &quot;The Revenge of Bussy D&#x27;Amboise.&quot;

As regards &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, the play was published anonymously, and was first attributed to Cyril Tourneur by Edward Archer in 1656. The attribution was also made by Francis Kirkman in lists of 1661 and 1671. Critics supporting Tourneur&#x27;s authorship attribution argued that the tragedy is unlike Middleton&#x27;s other early dramatic work, and that internal evidence, including some idiosyncrasies of spelling, points to Tourneur. However, the consensus of modern scholarship attributes the play to Middleton, citing stylistic similarities to Middleton&#x27;s other work and contextual evidence. 

Modern stagings of &quot;The Atheist&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; remain few and far between.

<text>William Benjamin Carpenter CB FRS (29 October 1813 – 19 November 1885) was an English physician, invertebrate zoologist, and physiologist. He was instrumental in the early stages of the unified University of London.

==Life==
Carpenter was born on 29 October 1813 in Exeter, the eldest son of Dr. Lant Carpenter and his wife, Anna Carpenter (née Penn). His father was an important Unitarian preacher who, according to Adrian Desmond, influenced a &quot;rising generation of Unitarian intellectuals, including James Martineau and the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;&#x27;s John Bowring.&quot; From his father, Carpenter learned to believe in the essential lawfulness of creation and that explanations of the world were to be found in physical causes. He embraced this &quot;naturalistic cosmogony&quot; as his starting point.

Carpenter was apprenticed in 1828 to the eye surgeon John Bishop Estlin, who was also the son of a Unitarian minister. He attended lectures at Bristol Medical School, then studied at University College London between 1834 and 1835, and then went to the University of Edinburgh, where he received his MD in 1839. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1845. In 1871, he received an LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh.

On his resignation in 1879, Carpenter was appointed CB in recognition of his services to education. He died on 19 November 1885 in London, having suffered burns when the fire heating a vapour bath he was taking was accidentally upset. He was buried in a family grave in the dissenter&#x27;s section on the western side of Highgate Cemetery.

==Career==
His graduation thesis on the nervous system of invertebrates, &quot;The Physiological Inferences to be deduced from the Structure of the Nervous System of Invertebrated Animals&quot;, won a gold medal, and led to his first books.He commenced his professional career as a physician in the Kingsdown suburb of Bristol. His work in comparative neurology was recognised in 1844 by his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society. His appointment as Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution in 1845 enabled him to exhibit his prowess as a teacher and lecturer. He was credited with having a gift of ready speech and luminous interpretation that placed him in the front rank of exponents, at a time when the popularisation of science was in its infancy.

He was appointed the first Swiney lecturer in Geology at the British Museum in 1847.
He worked hard as investigator, author, editor, demonstrator and lecturer throughout his life; but it was his researches in marine zoology, notably in the lower organisms, as foraminifera and crinoids, that were most valuable. This research gave an impetus to deep-sea exploration and led to Carpenter&#x27;s role, alongside the naturalist Charles Wyville Thomson, in leading the exploration missions of HMS &quot;Lightning&quot; and HMS &quot;Porcupine&quot; in northern Scotland from 1868 to 1870. The analysis of the physical observations made during these first cruises allowed Carpenter to sketch a new theory of the global ocean circulation, which differed in several points from the pioneering theory of the hydrographer Matthew Fontaine Maury. Based on the context of the time, including the development of underwater telegraphy, Carpenter was the main architect in convincing both the Admiralty and the British government to undertake a large-scale oceanographic expedition in order to extend observations on a global scale. These efforts led to the HMS &quot;Challenger&quot; circumnavigation from 1872 to 1876, which was the world&#x27;s first major oceanographic expedition.

He took a keen and laborious interest in the evidence adduced by Canadian geologists as to the organic nature of the so-called &quot;Eozoon canadense&quot;, discovered in the Laurentian strata, also called the North American craton, and at the time of his death had nearly finished a monograph on the subject, defending the now discredited theory of its animal origin. He was adept in the use of the microscope, and his popular treatise on it stimulated many to explore this new aid. He was awarded the Royal Medal in 1861.

Carpenter&#x27;s most famous work is &quot;The Use and Abuse of Alcoholic Liquors in Health and Disease&quot;, originally published as a long-form essay in London by Charles Gilpin in March 1850. It was one of the first temperance books to promote the view that alcoholism is a disease.

In 1856 Carpenter became Registrar of the University of London, and held the office for 23 years. He gave qualified support to Charles Darwin, but he had reservations as to the application of evolution to man&#x27;s intellectual and spiritual nature. He also demonstrated his commitment to the education of women, by teaching at the newly founded Bedford College, London in 1849 and 1850.

==Adaptive unconscious==
Carpenter is considered one of the founders of the modern theory of the adaptive unconscious. Together with William Hamilton and Thomas Laycock they provided the foundations on which adaptive unconscious is based today. They observed that the human perceptual system almost completely operates outside of conscious awareness. These same observations have been made by Hermann Helmholtz. Because these views were in conflict with the theories of Descartes, they were largely neglected, until the cognitive revolution of the 1950s. In 1874 Carpenter noticed that the more he studied the mechanism of thought, the more clear it became that it operates largely outside awareness. He noticed that the unconscious prejudices can be stronger than conscious thought and that they are more dangerous since they happen outside of conscious.

He also noticed that emotional reactions can occur outside of conscious until attention is drawn to them:
He also asserted both the freedom of the will and the existence of the ego.

==Psychical research==
Carpenter was a critic of claims of paranormal phenomena, psychical research, and spiritualism, which he wrote were &quot;epidemic delusions&quot;.

He was the author of the book &quot;Mesmerism, Spiritualism, Etc: Historically and Scientifically Considered&quot; (1877), which is seen as an early text on anomalistic psychology. According to Carpenter, Spiritualist practices could be explained by psychological factors such as hypnotism and suggestion. He rejected any occult or supernatural interpretation of hypnotism or trance-like states and insisted they were explained entirely by the physiology of the human mind. He argued that ideomotor effect (also called the Carpenter effect) could explain the phenomena of dowsing and table-turning. After experimental researches with tables, Michael Faraday credited to Carpenter the theoretical explanations for the results that he obtained.

Carpenter identified as a rationalist and a Unitarian. Although critical of spiritualism, he was interested in the subject of &quot;thought reading&quot;. He defended the mentalist Washington Irving Bishop, whom he had experimented with, and considered such feats to be of great interest to the study of physiology. This angered his colleagues, who felt that his public support for Bishop might damage the respectability of the scientific community. He was criticized by George Romanes and T. H. Huxley for his interest in thought reading.

Carpenter was a believer in a divine first cause. Historian Shannon Delorme has noted that although he was considered a &quot;great debunker of all humbug&quot;, his scientific thought was influenced by Unitarian culture that accommodated both materialist and teleological arguments.

==Family==
Carpenter married Louisa Powell in 1840 in Exeter. Louisa was born about 1814 in Exeter and died in 1887 in London. Among their children were:
* Philip Herbert Carpenter (1852–1891), zoologist and a master at Eton College. He assisted his father and wrote extensively on fossils.
* Joseph Estlin Carpenter (1844–1927), theologian and Unitarian.

<text>James Sully (3 March 1842 – 1 November 1923) was an English psychologist, philosopher and writer.

==Biography==
James Sully was born at Bridgwater, Somerset, the son of J. W. Sully, a liberal Baptist merchant and ship-owner. He was educated at the Independent College in Taunton, Regent&#x27;s Park College, at the University of Göttingen, where he studied under Hermann Lotze, and at the Humboldt University of Berlin, where he studied under Emil du Bois-Reymond and Hermann von Helmholtz.

Sully was originally destined for the nonconformist ministry and in 1869 became classical tutor at the Baptist College, Pontypool. In 1871, however, he adopted a literary and philosophic career. Between 1892 and 1903, he was Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London, where he was succeeded by Carveth Read.

An adherent of the associationist school of psychology, his views had great affinity with those of Alexander Bain. Sully wrote monographs on subjects such as pessimism, and psychology textbooks, some of the first in English, including &quot;The Human Mind &quot;(1892). His 1881 &quot;Illusions&quot; was commended by both Freud and Wundt.

Sully opened an experimental psychology laboratory at University College London in January 1898 and in 1901 was a founding member of the British Psychological Society.

Sully died in Richmond, Surrey on 1 November 1923.

<text>SLM Corporation (commonly known as Sallie Mae; originally the Student Loan Marketing Association) is a publicly traded U.S. corporation that provides consumer banking. Its nature has changed dramatically since it was set up in the early 1970s; initially a government entity that serviced federal education loans, it then became private and began offering private student loans.

The company&#x27;s primary business is creating, servicing, and collecting private education loans. The company also provides online tools and resources for college planning. Sallie Mae previously originated federally guaranteed student loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) and worked as a servicer and collector of federal student loans on behalf of the Department of Education. The company now offers private education loans and manages more than $12.97 billion in assets.

On April 30, 2014, Sallie Mae spun off its loan servicing operation and most of its loan portfolio into a separate, publicly traded entity called Navient Corporation. Navient is the largest servicer of federal student loans and acts as a collector on behalf of the Department of Education.

==History==
The Student Loan Marketing Association was originally created in 1972 as a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) and began privatizing its operations in 1997, a process it completed at the end of 2004 when Congress terminated its federal charter, ending its ties to the government. The company provides private education loans for students and their families. These loans are not made, insured, or guaranteed by any state or federal government.

In 2005, Sallie Mae was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.

In August 2006, Sallie Mae acquired Upromise, a company that provides rebates to buyers of certain brands, which can be applied to college savings accounts. In May 2020, Upromise was acquired by loyalty marketing company Prodege.

On April 16, 2007, Sallie Mae announced that an investor group led by J.C. Flowers &amp; Co. signed an agreement to purchase Sallie Mae for approximately $25 billion. Had the transaction been completed, J.C. Flowers, along with private-equity firm Friedman Fleischer &amp; Lowe would have owned 50.2% of Sallie Mae, and Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase would each have owned 24.9%. Sallie Mae would have ceased to be a publicly traded company. The deal fell through in September 2007, with the buyers blaming adverse changes to the business&#x27;s outlook as a result of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 and the tightening of global credit markets following the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis. Sallie Mae subsequently began legal action, only to drop it in January 2008 upon completion of a $31 billion funding round, including funding from Bank of America.

In 2008, SLM was bailed out by the US government through a buy back of FFEL private loans. 

On April 6, 2009, Sallie Mae announced that it would move 2,000 jobs back to the U.S. within the next 18 months as it shifts call center and other operations from overseas.

On March 31, 2010, Sallie Mae announced the impending layoff of 2,500 employees in response to the signing of new legislation calling for the federal government to lend directly to students, bypassing institutions like Sallie Mae.

On July 1, 2010, Sallie Mae announced that it would be moving its headquarters from Reston, Virginia, to its existing facility in Newark, Delaware.

On September 17, 2010, Sallie Mae acquired federally insured loans from Citigroup-owned Student Loan Corporation worth $28 billion.

SLM Corporation, the company that operates Sallie Mae, was formed in 2013. On February 25, 2014, Sallie Mae announced the launch of Navient, a separate entity for federal student loan servicing. On April 30, Sallie Mae legally separated from Navient, and made its primary focus private student loans, banking products, and credit cards for college students and their families.

In March 2020, the company announced Jonathan Witter, former Hilton executive, would replace Raymond Quinlan as the new CEO.

Sallie Mae announced a partnership with Mpower Financing in April 2021, to expand access to higher education for international and DACA students.

==Corporate information==
The Sallie Mae corporate headquarters is in Newark, Delaware. Sallie Mae also operates offices in New Castle, Delaware; Newton, Massachusetts; Indianapolis, Indiana; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Sterling, Virginia.

=== Corporate board ===
Albert Lord held the positions of vice chairman and CEO until his retirement 2013. Lord joined Sallie Mae in 1981, took over as CEO in 1995, and led the company&#x27;s privatization. On May 29, 2013, the board announced Jack Remondi as Lord&#x27;s successor.

Carter Franke is the current chair of Sallie Mae&#x27;s board of directors, since her appointment in June 2020. Prior to Franke, Raymond J. Quinlan served in the role, having joined the board in 2014 to replace previous chairman Anthony P. Terracciano—formerly president of First Union Corporation (now Wells Fargo). Quinlan was also the chief executive office of Sallie Mae from May 2014 until March 2020, when current CEO Jonathan Witter assumed the position. 

==Awards==
Through The Fund&#x27;s work, Sallie Mae was named among &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;&#x27;s Top 15 Corporate Philanthropists in 2004. The &quot;Washington Business Journal&quot; identified the company as the top local corporate philanthropist in 2005.

In the early 2010s, &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; recognized Sallie Mae Bank as the Best Online Savings Account, the Best Money Market Account. “the best place to stash cash,” and the Best Savings Account.

==Controversies==
A &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment (originally aired May 7, 2006) examined Sallie Mae, including its business practices. Senator Elizabeth Warren, then a professor at Harvard Law School and sharp critic of what she characterizes as unfair lending practices, questioned Sallie Mae&#x27;s dual role as lender and collector of student loans.

In February 2007, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo launched an investigation into alleged deceptive lending practices by student loan providers, including The College Board, EduCap, Nelnet, Citibank, and Sallie Mae. On April 11, 2007, Cuomo ended his investigation of Sallie Mae and announced that Sallie Mae had voluntarily agreed to change its lending standards to satisfy a new code of conduct for student loan practices established by Cuomo, and to donate $2 million (USD) to a fund devoted to educating college-bound students about their loan options.

On October 10, 2007, documents surfaced showing that Sallie Mae was attempting to use the Freedom of Information Act to force colleges to turn over students&#x27; personal information. The university involved, the State University of New York system, was expected to decline the request and be forced to defend its position in court.

In December 2007, a class action lawsuit was brought against Sallie Mae in a Connecticut federal court alleging that the company discriminated against African American and Hispanic private student loan applicants by charging them high interest rates and fees. The lawsuit also alleged that Sallie Mae failed to properly disclose private student loan terms to unsuspecting students. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, raised similar concerns about possible student loan redlining in June 2007. The lawsuit was settled and dismissed in 2011. Under the terms of the settlement, Sallie Mae agreed to make a $500,000 donation to the United Negro College Fund and the attorneys for the plaintiffs received $1.8 million in attorneys&#x27; fees.

On January 31, 2008, SLM Corporation paid $35,000,000 to settle a lawsuit for failing to adequately reserve for losses in Sallie Mae&#x27;s non-traditional portfolio.

A False Claims suit was filed against Sallie Mae by former U.S. Department of Education researcher, Dr. Oberg, in 2009. The suit alleges that Sallie Mae and other lenders deliberately overcharged the U.S. government. The findings by Oberg were labeled among higher education policy analysts as the 9.5 scandal.

On February 20, 2014, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan’s office announced that an investigation into Sallie Mae&#x27;s debt collection practices and loan servicing practices had been opened.

On November 9, 2005, former Sallie Mae employee Michael Zahara filed a federal lawsuit against the company, alleging that it had a pattern and practice of granting forbearance in a purposeful effort to increase total student loan debt. On October 29, 2008, permission was granted to his legal counsel to withdraw from the case, citing &quot;From counsel’s perspective, a breakdown in trust has resulted from the discovery that Relator has been arrested for extortion, the circumstances surrounding that arrest, and Relator’s failure to disclose the arrest to counsel.&quot; On March 12, 2009, the court ruled &quot;dismissal without prejudice&quot; because &quot;the plaintiff has failed to obtain substitute counsel by the deadline.&quot;

<text>John Sterling (20 July 1806 – 18 September 1844) was a Scottish author.

==Life==
Sterling was born at Kames Castle on the Isle of Bute, the son of Edward Sterling. After studying for a year at the University of Glasgow, he in 1824 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he had for tutor Julius Charles Hare. At Cambridge he took part in the debates of the Cambridge Union Society, and became a member of the Cambridge Apostles, forming friendships with Frederick Denison Maurice and Richard Trench. He moved to Trinity Hall with the intention of graduating in law but left the university without taking a degree.

During the next four years, Sterling resided chiefly in London, employing himself actively in literature and making a number of literary friends. With F. D. Maurice he purchased the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; magazine in 1828 from James Silk Buckingham, but the enterprise was not a financial success. He also formed an intimacy with the Spanish revolutionary General Torrijos, in whose unfortunate expedition he took an active interest. He raised funds for Spanish liberal exiles to carry out their plans for insurrection, and his words influenced young Robert Boyd to give his family inheritance to Torrijos&#x27;s cause. On 2 November 1830, at Christ Church, Marylebone, Sterling married Susannah, daughter of Lieutenant-General Charles Barton (1760–1819) and his wife Susannah.

Shortly after his marriage in 1830 symptoms of tuberculosis induced Sterling to take up his residence on the island of St Vincent, where he had inherited some property, and he remained there for fifteen months before returning to England. While at St Vincent he wrote &quot;So far as I see, the Slaves here are cunning, deceitful and idle; without any great aptitude for ferocious crimes, and with very little scruple at committing others. But I have seen them much only in very favorable circumstances. They are, as a body, decidedly unfit for freedom; and if left, as at present, completely in the hands of their masters, will never become so, unless through the agency of the Methodists.&quot; After spending some time on the Continent in June 1834, Sterling was ordained and became curate at Hurstmonceux, where his old tutor Julius Hare was vicar. Acting on the advice of his physician, he resigned from his clerical duties in the following February, but, according to Carlyle, the primary cause was a divergence from the opinions of the Church. There remained to him the &quot;resource of the pen,&quot; but, having to &quot;live all the rest of his days as in continual flight for his very existence,&quot; his literary achievements were necessarily fragmentary.

In 1841 Sterling moved to Falmouth, and lectured to the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society. He died at Ventnor on 18 September 1844, his wife having died in the preceding year.

==Works==
Sterling published in 1833 &quot;Arthur Coningsby&quot;, a novel, which attracted little attention, and his &quot;Poems&quot; (1839), the &quot;Election, a Poem&quot; (1841), and &quot;Strafford&quot;, a tragedy (1843), were not more successful. He had, however, established a connection in 1837 with &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, to which he contributed a variety of papers and several tales. Among these papers were allegorical fantasy stories such as &quot;The Onyx Ring&quot;, &quot;Land and Sea&quot;, &quot;A Chronicle of England&quot; and &quot;The Palace of Morgana.&quot;

John Sterling&#x27;s papers were given to the joint care of Thomas Carlyle and Hare. &quot;Essays and Tales, by John Sterling collected and edited, with a memoir of his life, by Julius Charles Hare&quot;, appeared in 1848 in two volumes. Carlyle was dissatisfied with the &quot;Memoir&quot; and wrote a vivid &quot;Life&quot; (1851).

Sterling corresponded with John Stuart Mill, who had attended the informal beginnings of his &#x27;Sterling Club&#x27;.

==Family==
His son, Major-General John Barton Sterling (1840–1926), after entering the navy, went into the army in 1861, and had a distinguished career (wounded at Tel-el-Kebir in 1882), both as a soldier and as a writer on military subjects. He commanded the Coldstream Guards until his retirement in 1901. He was a member of the Athenaeum Club and the Royal Yacht Squadron.

<text>Plastic Man (Patrick &quot;Eel&quot; O&#x27;Brian) is a superhero first appearing in &quot;Police Comics&quot; #1, originally published by Quality Comics and later acquired by DC Comics, appearing in their American comic books. Created by cartoonist Jack Cole, Plastic Man was one of the first superheroes to incorporate humor into mainstream action storytelling. This character has been published in several solo series and has interacted with other characters such as Batman and many others in the mainstream DC Universe as a member of the Justice League.

Plastic Man has been substantially adapted into media outside comics. Tom Kenny, Dana Snyder, and Michael Bell, among others, have voiced the character in animated television series and films.

==Publication history==
Plastic Man was created by writer-artist Jack Cole, and first appeared in &quot;Police Comics&quot; #1 (August 1941).

One of Quality Comics&#x27; signature characters during the Golden Age of Comic Books, Plastic Man can stretch his body into any imaginable form. His adventures were known for their quirky, offbeat structure and surreal slapstick humor. DC Comics acquired the character, among others, after Quality Comics shut down in 1956.

Although the character has never been a significant commercial success, Plastic Man has been a favorite character of many modern comic book creators, including writer Grant Morrison, who included him in their 1990s revival of the Justice League; Art Spiegelman, who profiled Cole for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine; painter Alex Ross, who has frequently included him in covers and stories depicting the Justice League; writer-artist Kyle Baker, who wrote and illustrated an award-winning &quot;Plastic Man&quot; series; and Frank Miller, who included him in the Justice League in the comics &quot;All Star Batman &amp; Robin, the Boy Wonder&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Original version by Jack Cole===
Plastic Man was a crook named Patrick &quot;Eel&quot; O&#x27;Brian. Orphaned at age 10 and forced to live on the streets, he fell into a life of crime. As an adult, he became part of a burglary ring, specializing as a safecracker. During a late-night heist at the Crawford Chemical Works, he and his three fellow gang members were surprised by a night watchman. During the gang&#x27;s escape, Eel was shot in the shoulder and doused with a large drum of unidentified chemical liquid. He escaped to the street only to discover that his gang had driven off without him.

Fleeing on foot and suffering increasing disorientation from the gunshot wound and the exposure to the chemical, Eel eventually passed out on the foothills of a mountain near the city. He awoke to find himself in a bed in a mountain retreat, being tended to by a monk who had discovered him unconscious that morning. This monk, sensing a capacity for great good in O&#x27;Brian, turned away police officers who had trailed Eel to the monastery. This act of faith and kindness—combined with the realization that his gang had left him to be captured without a moment&#x27;s hesitation—fanned Eel&#x27;s longstanding dissatisfaction with his criminal life and his desire to reform.

During his short convalescence at the monastery, he discovered that the chemical had entered his bloodstream and caused a radical physical change. His body now had all of the properties of rubber, allowing him to stretch, bounce and mold himself into any shape. He immediately determined to use his new abilities on the side of law and order, donning a red, black and yellow (later red and yellow) rubber costume and capturing criminals as Plastic Man. He concealed his true identity with a pair of white goggles and by re-molding his face. As O&#x27;Brian, he maintained his career and connections with the underworld as a means of gathering information on criminal activity.

Plastic Man soon acquired comic-relief sidekick Woozy Winks, who was originally enchanted so that nature itself would protect him from harm. This power was eventually removed from the character and Woozy became simply a bumbling yet loyal friend to Plastic Man.

In his original Golden Age/Quality Comics incarnation, Plastic Man eventually became a member of the city police force and then the FBI. By the time he became a federal officer, he had nearly completely abandoned his Eel O&#x27;Brian identity.

===Phil Foglio version===
After the 1985 &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, a 1988–1989 four-issue &quot;Plastic Man&quot; miniseries by Phil Foglio introduced a new version of Plastic Man: Eel O&#x27;Brian, abandoned by his criminal gang after being shot and exposed to the unidentified chemical, wandered the streets as his new powers developed, frightening others and bringing the police and National Guard down on him as a dangerous monster. Eel was at first oblivious to the changes to his body, but after realizing that he was the monster at large, he used his new abilities to escape his pursuers. Eel soon became so despondent over his new condition that he attempted suicide by jumping off a bridge.

Fortunately, he was interrupted by Woozy Winks, a former mental patient who was kicked out of an institution due to lack of funding (or as Woozy put it, &quot;something called Reaganomics&quot;), who desired nothing more than to return to the warm safety of a straitjacket and padded room. Eel and Woozy decided to work together and capitalize on Eel&#x27;s new powers to make their fortunes (Eel wanting to get rich quick, Woozy just wanting his &quot;old room&quot; back), but could not decide whether there was more money in crime or crime-fighting, and resorted to flipping a coin to choose serving the law (though Woozy had his doubts early on). Eel ended up with the name &#x27;Plastic Man&#x27; after a reporter misinterpreted his first choice of &#x27;Elastic Man&#x27;. Eel and Woozy set up a detective agency in New York City and go on to have various misadventures together.

===JLA===
Plastic Man was made a prominent member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison&#x27;s run on the title. The story arc &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; shows Batman recruiting Eel to infiltrate Lex Luthor&#x27;s Injustice League in the guise of the Joker, which he does successfully. He notably engages in combat with the goddess Circe, proving immune to her ability to turn humans into animals. He is later made a full-time member of the League and aids the League in several battles, including against Prometheus, Julian September, General Wade Eiling, an upgraded version of Amazo, a White Martian who assumes the identity of Bruce Wayne, and Queen Bee. During this period he becomes close friends with fellow new members Steel (due to the fact that they are both &quot;lateral thinkers&quot;) and Zauriel (Plastic Man later implies in the &quot;JLA: Heaven&#x27;s Ladder&quot; graphic novel that his Catholic upbringing is a factor behind this, and Zauriel&#x27;s existence is a testament to his faith). After the extended League dissolves at the end of the &quot;World WarIII&quot; arc, he is the only member other than the &#x27;Big Seven&#x27; heroes (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, The Flash, Martian Manhunter and Green Lantern) to retain full-time membership in the JLA.

Plastic Man has also been instrumental in defeating several foes by himself, such as a Jokerized version of Doctor Polaris and the &#x27;Burning Martian&#x27; persona of J&#x27;onn J&#x27;onzz (Martian Manhunter). He has played substantial roles in nearly every major team-up and crossover featuring the League of this era: with the Titans (The Technis Imperative), Young Justice (World Without Grownups), the Justice Society of America (Virtue and Vice, where he is one of the heroes to be possessed by one of the Seven Deadly Sins), the Avengers (the &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; crossover) and even the Looney Tunes (in the humorous &quot;Superman &amp; Bugs Bunny&quot; miniseries). In the &quot;&quot; arc, Plastic Man is frozen and shattered into pieces by Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s League of Assassins, as part of an attack against the Justice League. (He Joins the Avengers for a short time) Though he is put together again, this experience traumatizes him severely and when it is discovered that the assassins were following methods devised by Batman, Eel joins Wonder Woman and Aquaman in voting Batman out of the League. The heroes reconcile in following issues.

The fact that Plastic Man was initially in the superhero business for the money has had an effect on his character development, notably in the storyline &quot;Divided We Fall&quot; by Mark Waid where he, along with other Justice League members, was separated into two people, his normal &quot;civilian&quot; identity and his superhero persona, by the manipulative wish-granting Id. While Plastic Man devolved from a person with a sense of humor into a constantly wisecracking and almost ineffectual idiot, the now &quot;normal&quot; Eel O&#x27;Brian struggled with the criminal tendencies he had suppressed as he had become comfortable with his role as a superhero and wondered if he had actually changed for the better at all or this was just part of the super-hero &quot;act&quot;. Ultimately, Eel was the driving force behind the other transformed Leaguers banding together to re-join with their superheroic selves, noting that Bruce Wayne in particular was approaching a mental breakdown as he struggled with his rage over his parents&#x27; murder – having lacked the ability to do anything about it, as Batman was the identity that had &#x27;inherited&#x27; his skills. Eel demonstrates this to the other divided Leaguers by savagely beating Bruce Wayne with a gun in the guise of a mugger to prove Wayne&#x27;s ineffectiveness, and demonstrate the degree of psychological damage he has suffered due to the split. Later, Batman comments that it was a wise move &quot;under the circumstances&quot;. Later, Plastic Man approaches Batman for help when he learns that Eel&#x27;s estranged ten-year-old son Luke has fallen in with a gang of criminals, and has inherited his father&#x27;s shape-shifting abilities, possibly to an even greater degree than Plastic Man&#x27;s own. Plastic Man admits to Batman that he doesn&#x27;t know if he ran away from being a father because he was enjoying his new life as a hero, or because he was afraid of becoming a parent for his son. Batman later intimidates Luke into returning home, and informs Plastic Man that he is disappointed in his cowardice, imagining that Eel would have shown Luke fatherly love; in reality, Plastic Man chose only to hide in Batman&#x27;s utility belt during the whole encounter with Luke.

During the story arc &quot;The Obsidian Age&quot;, Plastic Man and the other main members of the JLA were transported through time thousands of years earlier to the beginning days of Atlantis. During a battle with the antagonists, Plastic Man was frozen and then shattered into pieces. Having no way to locate all the pieces, much less fix him, with the technology of the day, the JLA returned to their own time. There they were eventually successful in finding all the pieces and restoring Plastic Man. Plastic Man had been conscious the entire time but unable to move, which had a profoundly negative effect on his mind. He admitted he had lost his nerve and quit the JLA, hoping to live a regular life. This return to normalcy was made easier after a new encounter with his now-teenage son, which made Eel feel that the boy needed a father and a normal life. Eventually, Batman convinced Plastic Man to return to his life as a super hero again when they needed his shape-shifting skills and immunity to telepathy to defeat the Martian Manhunter, who had regressed to a racial memory of the long-forgotten &#x27;Burning Martians&#x27; after overcoming his weakness to fire. After a few more cases, Plastic Man is present at the memorial service held after this incarnation of the Justice League officially disbands during the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline.

===52, One Year Later, Countdown and Blackest Night===
In the 2006 &quot;One Year Later&quot; DC Comics crossover storyline that followed the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; crossover, a young man with similar appearance and powers as Plastic Man appears briefly in the superteam series &quot;Teen Titans&quot; Vol. 3, #34 written by R.J. Carter. The character wears a white costume with red goggles, similar to that of Offspring, Plastic Man&#x27;s son in the earlier 1999 DC miniseries &quot;The Kingdom&quot; by Mark Waid. While the Teen Titans story itself does not identify the character, page two of a published script supposedly by writer Geoff Johns&#x27; specifies it is &quot;Plastic Man&#x27;s son, Offspring&quot;. Plastic Man&#x27;s son is also shown in costume, and identified as Offspring, in the 2006 weekly series &quot;52&quot; in Week 35 (written by Geoff Johns, Grant Morrison, Greg Rucka and Mark Waid) when he is injured while rescuing a number of the depowered Everyman heroes. Eventually, Plastic Man and Offspring come together as father and son and briefly even had an idyllic family set up until Plastic Man was convinced that he could not deny his destiny as a super hero.

In &quot;Countdown to Mystery&quot; #1 (2007) written by Lilah Sturges, Plastic Man is seduced by Eclipso, being made to believe he is a joke among his fellow heroes, and the only way for him to get some respect is through Eclipso. He is later freed of this corruption by Bruce Gordon. Plastic Man makes his next appearance within the pages of &quot;Green Arrow/Black Canary&quot; #8 by Judd Winick, having been freed from a stasis tube by Green Arrow. His DNA is taken by Sivana and used to augment an amnesiac Connor Hawke, in a bid to turn the young hero into a brainwashed slave with a strong healing factor.

Plastic Man appeared for a brief period in the 2009 &quot;Justice League of America&quot; vol. 2 series written by Len Wein. After joining up with the team following the events of &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Plastic Man has his effectiveness questioned by his teammate Dr. Light, which starts a fight between the two, which Vixen breaks up. Vixen reassigns Plastic Man to team up with Dr. Light to stop the Royal Flush Gang robbery. Though they experience some control issues between them, the Royal Flush Gang is defeated and Plastic Man and Dr. Light finally stop arguing.

During a massive battle at the Justice League Satellite in &quot;Justice League: Cry for Justice&quot;, Prometheus injected Plastic Man with a chemical that badly damaged his plastic body. The chemicals caused Eel to suffer from a condition where it took great concentration to keep himself in his usual, semi-solid state and caused him pain when he even thought about changing shape, thus leaving him in an infirm state.

In the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; crossover, while still suffering from his deteriorating state, Plastic Man had his heart torn out by the Black Lantern, Vibe, seemingly killing him. However, due to his power of near-invulnerability, he was able to survive such an attack, albeit badly wounded. Vixen states that Plastic Man was being taken care of at STAR Labs, and that he would be unable to return to the League.

Plastic Man later appeared in &quot;Justice League: Generation Lost&quot;, helping a large coalition of heroes on an unsuccessful mission to trace Maxwell Lord. He had been seemingly cured of his condition, and was shown retaining his normal shape without issue or pain.

Later, he aids the JLA on their mission into Hell, where he helps Batman defeat Geryon. The League learns Satanus&#x27; plans to use Dante&#x27;s mask to become powerful. Plastic Man grabs the mask, which possesses him. The Leagues combines forces to remove the mask, which is incinerated, seemingly killing Plastic Man. It is later revealed that Zauriel transported him into another dimension before helping the League escape Hell.

===The New 52===
In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, Plastic Man is considered as one of the candidates for the United Nations-sponsored Justice League International. He is denied a spot on the team for being too unpredictable. This cameo appearance was later retconned by &quot;Eel&quot; O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s proper New 52 introduction in &quot;Justice League&quot; (Vol. 2) #25 (February 2014).

===DC Rebirth===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. In &quot;Dark Days: The Forge&quot;, Batman unveils a containment unit to Mister Terrific in The Lunar Batcave bearing the Plastic Man logo and suggests it is time to release him.

In &quot;The Terrifics&quot; series, Plastic Man joins the eponymous group, consisting of himself, Metamorpho, and Mister Terrific, in traveling the Dark Multiverse after being sucked into Simon Stagg&#x27;s portal. They also encounter Linnya Wazzo, an alien who had been trapped in the Dark Multiverse since she was young. After the Terrifics defeat the Terribles, Plastic Man&#x27;s son Luke, Element Dog, and Miss Terrific join the roster.

Obscura later recruits Plastic Man to investigate a multi-dimensional conspiracy led by the Cabal.

==Powers and abilities==

Plastic Man&#x27;s powers are derived from an accident in which his body was bathed in an unknown industrial chemical mixture that entered his bloodstream through a gunshot wound. This caused a body-wide mutagenic process that transformed his physiology. Eel exists in a fluid state, neither entirely liquid nor solid. He has complete control over his entire molecular structure. He can stretch his limbs and body to superhuman lengths and sizes. There is no known limit to how far Plastic Man can stretch his body. He can shrink himself down to a few inches tall (posed as one of Batman&#x27;s utility belt pockets) or become a titan (the size of skyscrapers). He can contort his body into various positions and sizes impossible for ordinary humans, such as being entirely flat to slip under a door, using his fingers to pick conventional lock, compressing himself into a ball to ricochet off of things, and inflating his body. He can also use it for disguise by changing the shape of his face and body, contributory to his work as a sleuth. Due to his fluid state, Plastic Man can open holes in his body and turn himself into objects with mobile parts. In addition, he can alter his bodily mass and physical constitution at will, creating virtually no limit to the sizes and shapes he can contort himself into. There is nothing he cannot alter his body into, which includes basic shapes or dangerous weapons, avatars of other superheroes, and functional automobiles. These stretching capabilities grant Plastic Man agility, flexibility, and coordination far beyond the natural limits of the human body. He can alter his strength by growing or adding more muscle.

Plastic Man&#x27;s powers extraordinarily augment his durability. Some stories, perhaps of anecdotal quality, have showed him susceptible to surprise attack by bullets, in one case oozing a substance similar to liquid plastic. His unique physiology makes him impervious to conventional means of harm such as bullets, blasts, and blunt force. He is also able to withstand corrosives, punctures, and concussions without sustaining any injury (although he can be momentarily stunned). Batman once mentioned that he could presumably even withstand a nuclear detonation. This is mainly due to the fact that he has full control over his density, so he can willfully increase his durability as he wishes. His bodily mass can be dispersed, but for all intents and purposes, it is invulnerable, even from many forms of magic in the DC Universe. He is able to regenerate or assimilate lost or damaged tissue, although he needs to be reasonably intact for this process to begin. For example, Plastic Man was once reduced to individual, separate molecules and scattered across the Atlantic Ocean for centuries. He was only capable of returning to his usual form after the rest of the League were able to gather enough of his molecules and restore approximately 80% of his body mass, after which he began to regenerate the remaining 20% on his own.

Plastic Man has proven to be insusceptible to the effects of telepathy. As stated by Batman (in &quot;JLA&quot; #88, Dec. 2003), &quot;Plastic Man&#x27;s mind is no longer organic. It&#x27;s untouchable by telepathy&quot;. Plastic Man does not appear to age; if he does, it is at a rate far slower than that of normal human beings. In the aftermath of the &quot;Justice League&quot; story Arc &quot;Obsidian Age&quot;, Plastic Man was discovered to have survived for 3,000 years scattered into separate, individual molecules on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean without decaying or being otherwise affected at all. He can autonomically detect ultrasonic frequencies because his body will start to &quot;ripple&quot; when an ultrasonic frequency is triggered.

As stated by the Black Lantern corpsman Vibe, Plastic Man&#x27;s internal organs (such as his heart when Black Lantern Vibe tried to rip it out) could not be removed, unlike many of the Black Lanterns&#x27; victims. This perhaps implies that Plastic Man is himself more like one giant, living organ than he is a &quot;whole&quot; made of component parts and organs, etc.

His semi-liquid form remains stable at relatively high and low temperatures, provided that the temperature change is gradual. A sudden change induces a complete change of state, creating a truly solid or truly liquid form. Plastic Man was incapacitated in the &quot;JLA&quot; story arc &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; when mercenaries froze and shattered his body. Once thawed and reassembled, he was physically unharmed. In the &quot;JLA&quot; story arc &quot;Divided We Fall&quot;, Plastic Man is shown to have some weakness to extreme heat (intense heat vision attack from a Martian) and was temporarily melted. In some versions, Plastic Man is vulnerable to chemicals such as acetone, which melts and destabilizes his body. Furthermore, he is initially unable to change the color of his body, requiring great concentration to do so.

Plastic Man was once a very talented professional thief, specializing as a safecracker. Although no longer a criminal, he has thorough insight into their mindset, enabling him to be an effective sleuth. He is also considered to be a lateral thinker and much smarter than he lets on.

<text>A pier is a raised structure that rises above a body of water and usually juts out from its shore, typically supported by piles or pillars, and provides above-water access to offshore areas. Frequent pier uses include fishing, boat docking and access for both passengers and cargo, and oceanside recreation. Bridges, buildings, and walkways may all be supported by architectural piers. Their open structure allows tides and currents to flow relatively unhindered, whereas the more solid foundations of a quay or the closely spaced piles of a wharf can act as a breakwater, and are consequently more liable to silting. Piers can range in size and complexity from a simple lightweight wooden structure to major structures extended over . In American English, a pier may be synonymous with a dock.

Piers have been built for several purposes, and because these different purposes have distinct regional variances, the term &quot;pier&quot; tends to have different nuances of meaning in different parts of the world. Thus in North America and Australia, where many ports were, until recently, built on the multiple pier model, the term tends to imply a current or former cargo-handling facility. In contrast, in Europe, where ports more often use basins and river-side quays than piers, the term is principally associated with the image of a Victorian cast iron pleasure pier which emerged in Great Britain during the early 19th century. However, the earliest piers pre-date the Victorian age.

==Types==
Piers can be categorized into different groupings according to the principal purpose. However, there is considerable overlap between these categories. For example, pleasure piers often also allow for the docking of pleasure steamers and other similar craft, while working piers have often been converted to leisure use after being rendered obsolete by advanced developments in cargo-handling technology. Many piers are floating piers, to ensure that the piers raise and lower with the tide along with the boats tied to them. This prevents a situation where lines become overly taut or loose by rising or lowering tides. An overly taut or loose tie-line can damage boats by pulling them out of the water or allowing them so much leeway that they bang forcefully against the sides of the pier.

===Working piers===

Working piers were built for the handling of passengers and cargo onto and off ships or (as at Wigan Pier) canal boats. Working piers themselves fall into two different groups. Longer individual piers are often found at ports with large tidal ranges, with the pier stretching far enough off shore to reach deep water at low tide. Such piers provided an economical alternative to impounded docks where cargo volumes were low, or where specialist bulk cargo was handled, such as at coal piers. The other form of working pier, often called the finger pier, was built at ports with smaller tidal ranges. Here the principal advantage was to give a greater available quay length for ships to berth against compared to a linear littoral quayside, and such piers are usually much shorter. Typically each pier would carry a single transit shed the length of the pier, with ships berthing bow or stern in to the shore. Some major ports consisted of large numbers of such piers lining the foreshore, classic examples being the Hudson River frontage of New York, or the Embarcadero in San Francisco.

The advent of container shipping, with its need for large container handling spaces adjacent to the shipping berths, has made working piers obsolete for the handling of general cargo, although some still survive for the handling of passenger ships or bulk cargos. One example, is in use in Progreso, Yucatán, where a pier extends more than 4 miles into the Gulf of Mexico, making it the longest pier in the world. The Progreso Pier supplies much of the peninsula with transportation for the fishing and cargo industries and serves as a port for large cruise ships in the area. Many other working piers have been demolished, or remain derelict, but some have been recycled as pleasure piers. The best known example of this is Pier 39 in San Francisco.

At Southport and the Tweed River on the Gold Coast in Australia, there are piers that support equipment for a sand bypassing system that maintains the health of sandy beaches and navigation channels.

===Pleasure piers===
Pleasure piers were first built in Britain during the early 19th century. The earliest structures were Ryde Pier, built in 1813/4, Trinity Chain Pier near Leith, built in 1821, Brighton Chain Pier, built in 1823. and Margate Jetty 1823/24 originally a timber built pier.
Only the oldest of these piers still remains. At that time, the introduction of steamships and railways for the first time permitted mass tourism to dedicated seaside resorts. The large tidal ranges at many such resorts meant that passengers arriving by pleasure steamer could use a pier to disembark safely. Also, for much of the day, the sea was not visible from the shore and the pleasure pier permitted holidaymakers to promenade over and alongside the sea at all times. The world&#x27;s longest pleasure pier is at Southend-on-Sea, Essex, and extends 1.3 miles (2.1 km) into the Thames Estuary. The longest pier on the West Coast of the US is the Santa Cruz Wharf, with a length of .

Providing a walkway out to sea, pleasure piers often include amusements and theatres as part of their attractions. Such a pier may be unroofed, closed, or partly open and partly closed. Sometimes a pier has two decks. Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier in Galveston, Texas has a roller coaster, 15 rides, carnival games and souvenir shops.

Early pleasure piers were of complete timber construction, as was with Margate which opened in 1824. The first iron and timber built pleasure pier Margate Jetty, opened in 1855. Margate pier was wrecked by a storm in January 1978 and not repaired. The longest iron pleasure pier still remaining is the one at Southend. First opened as a wooden pier in 1829, it was reconstructed in iron and completed in 1889. In a 2006 UK poll, the public voted the seaside pier onto the list of icons of England.

===Fishing piers===
Many piers are built for the purpose of providing boatless anglers access to fishing grounds that are otherwise inaccessible. Many &quot;Free Piers&quot; are available in larger harbors which differ from private piers. Free Piers are often primarily used for fishing. Fishing from a pier presents a set of different circumstances to fishing from the shore or beach, as you do not need to cast out into the deeper water. This being the case there are specific fishing rigs that have been created specifically for pier fishing which allow for the direct access to deeper water.

==Piers of the world==
===Belgium===
In Blankenberge a first pleasure pier was built in 1894. After its destruction in the World War I, a new pier was built in 1933. It remained till the present day, but was partially transformed and modernized in 1999–2004.

In Nieuwpoort, Belgium there is a pleasure pier on both sides of the river IJzer.

===Netherlands===
Scheveningen, the coastal resort town of The Hague, boasts the largest pier in the Netherlands, completed in 1961. A crane, built on top of the pier&#x27;s panorama tower, provides the opportunity to make a high bungee jump over the North Sea waves. The present pier is a successor of an earlier pier, which was completed in 1901 but in 1943 destroyed by the German occupation forces.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
The first recorded pier in England was Ryde Pier, opened in 1814 on the Isle of Wight, as a landing stage to allow ferries to and from the mainland to berth. It is still used for this purpose today. It also had a leisure function in the past, with the pier head once containing a pavilion, and there are still refreshment facilities today. The oldest cast iron pier in the world is Town Pier, Gravesend, in Kent, which opened in 1834. However, it is not recognised by the National Piers Society as being a seaside pier.

Following the building of the world&#x27;s first seaside pier at Ryde, the pier became fashionable at seaside resorts in England and Wales during the Victorian era, peaking in the 1860s with 22 being built in that decade. A symbol of the typical British seaside holiday, by 1914, more than 100 pleasure piers were located around the UK coast. Regarded as being among the finest Victorian architecture, there are still a significant number of seaside piers of architectural merit still standing, although some have been lost, including Margate, two at Brighton in East Sussex, one at New Brighton in the Wirral and three at Blackpool in Lancashire. Two piers, Brighton&#x27;s now derelict West Pier and Clevedon Pier, were Grade 1 listed. The Birnbeck Pier in Weston-super-Mare is the only pier in the world linked to an island. The National Piers Society gives a figure of 55 surviving seaside piers in England and Wales. In 2017, Brighton Palace Pier was said to be the most visited tourist attraction outside London, with over 4.5 million visitors the previous year.

<doc id="277357" wikidata="Q336049" url="?curid=277357" title="Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde">
<text>Field Marshal Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde, (20 October 1792– 14 August 1863), was a British Army officer. After serving in the Peninsular War and the War of 1812, he commanded the 98th Regiment of Foot during the First Opium War and then commanded a brigade during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. He went on to command the Highland Brigade at the Battle of Alma and with his &quot;thin red line of Highlanders&quot; he repulsed the Russian attack on Balaclava during the Crimean War. At an early stage of the Indian Mutiny, he became Commander-in-Chief, India and, in that role, he relieved and then evacuated Lucknow and, after attacking and decisively defeating Tatya Tope at the Second Battle of Cawnpore, captured Lucknow again. Whilst still commander-in-chief he dealt with the &quot;White Mutiny&quot; among East India Company troops, and organised the army sent east in the Second Opium War.

==Early life==
Campbell was born Colin Macliver, the eldest of the four children of John Macliver, a cabinetmaker in Glasgow, and Agnes Macliver (née Campbell). His mother and one of his twin sisters died while he was still a boy. His only brother was killed fighting in the Peninsular War. After he was educated at the Glasgow Grammar School, his uncle, Major John Campbell, took over his care and sent him to the Royal Military and Naval Academy at Gosport.

The most oft-quoted story explaining Campbell&#x27;s name change is that upon Colin&#x27;s entry into the 9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot as an ensign in 1808, his uncle presented him to the Duke of York, who assumed the boy&#x27;s surname was Campbell and had him enlisted in the Army under that name. This story was first promulgated during the Crimean War. The press were fascinated to find why he had changed his name, and rumours abounded that he was in fact the illegitimate son of Major Campbell, so Peter Macliver, a journalist and Colin&#x27;s cousin, invented the story about the Duke of York. Not only was it highly unusual for an ensign to meet the commander-in-chief, the Duke of York, but Campbell was on the Isle of Wight, not in London when commissioned. Furthermore, General Robert Brownrigg, colonel of the regiment of the 9th Foot, wrote to the Duke of York prior to Campbell&#x27;s commission, referring to the fifteen-year-old boy as &quot;Mr Colin Campbell&quot;. Evidently, Campbell changed his name before being gazetted.

==Military career==

===Junior officer===
Campbell was commissioned as an ensign in the 9th Regiment of Foot on 26 May 1808. His first experience of war was under Sir Arthur Wellesley at the Battle of Vimeiro on 21 August 1808 during the Peninsular War. His battalion remained in Portugal and served under Sir John Moore during his foray into Spain, and subsequent retreat to Corunna. His battalion was not engaged at the Battle of Corunna in January 1809, but remained in reserve. Promoted to lieutenant on 15 July 1809, he took part in the disastrous Walcheren Campaign in Autumn 1809 and contracted malaria there.

Campbell was posted to Gibraltar in 1810 and fought at the Battle of Barrosa in March 1811, taking command of the 9th Foot&#x27;s flank companies as the senior officer not &quot;hors de combat&quot;. His bravery was noted by General Sir Thomas Graham. Serving in his battalion&#x27;s light company, he fought at the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813 and at the Siege of San Sebastián. Here, in the first assault on 25 July 1813, he led the forlorn hope and was wounded twice while leading a storming party. He led the 9th Foot&#x27;s light company at the Battle of the Bidassoa in October 1813 where he was wounded for the third time. He was promoted to captain in the 7th Battalion 60th (Royal American) Regiment on 3 November 1813. Sent to Halifax, Nova Scotia, he was too late to see action in the War of 1812 and soon returned to Europe suffering from his wounds. Due to the contraction of the army after Battle of Waterloo, the number of Royal American battalions was cut back drastically. To avoid being put on half-pay Campbell transferred to the 21st Royal North British Fusiliers on 26 November 1818. The regiment was sent first to Barbados and then to Demerara, where Campbell became aide-de-camp to the governor. His part in quelling the slave rebellion in Demerara in August 1823 is hazy. He is not recorded as joining in the reprisals against slaves pursued by his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Leahy, but he was on the court-martial which sentenced Reverend John Smith, the suspected instigator of the revolt, to death. He purchased his majority on 26 November 1825.

===Commands===
His regiment returned to England and in 1828 was posted to Ireland. From late 1830 they were called upon to police the Irish Tithe War. Campbell purchased an unattached lieutenant-colonelcy on 26 October 1832 Campbell became commanding officer of the 9th Regiment of Foot on 8 May 1835 but then exchanged to become commanding officer of the 98th Regiment of Foot on 19 June 1835 and commanded that regiment at the Battle of Chinkiang in July 1842 during the First Opium War. Promoted to colonel on 23 December 1842, he became commandant of Hong Kong at the end of that year. He was appointed an aide-de-camp to the Queen on 23 December 1842 and a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 24 December 1842.

Campbell was given command of a brigade of British troops in Lahore in British India in 1847. He led his brigade at the Battle of Ramnagar in November 1848, and a division at the Battle of Chillianwala in January 1849 and at the decisive Battle of Gujrat in February 1849 during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 5 June 1849. After defusing a local mutiny of native troops at Rawalpindi, he was then posted to Peshawar in August 1849. Lord Dalhousie, Governor-General of India, requested Campbell lead increasing punitive expeditions against Pathan tribesmen. Finally, when Dalhousie asked Campbell to mount an invasion of the Swat Valley, Campbell resigned in disgust.

In 1854 Campbell was appointed Colonel of the 67th Regiment of Foot and subsequently of the 93rd Regiment of Foot.

===Crimean War===
In early 1854, shortly after the Crimean War broke out, Campbell accepted the command of the Highland Brigade. He was promoted to brevet brigadier-general on 21 February 1854 and to major-general on 20 June 1854. The Highland Brigade distinguished itself at the Battle of Alma in September 1854 and, with his &quot;thin red line of Highlanders&quot;, Campbell repulsed the Russian attack on Balaclava in October 1854. He was promoted to the local rank of lieutenant general on 23 January 1855 and advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 5 July 1855. When the Duke of Cambridge returned to England, Campbell took command of the 1st Division (Guards and Highland brigades) and commanded the Division at the Battle of the Great Redan in September 1855. Promoted to the local rank of full general on 28 December 1855 and the substantive rank of lieutenant general on 4 June 1856, he remained in the Crimea hoping to take overall command, but when General Sir William Codrington was appointed instead, he returned home in a huff. Prince Albert suggested the army in the Crimea be split into two corps d&#x27;armee, and Campbell be given one. Lord Panmure requested Queen Victoria ask Campbell return to command one of these corps, and Campbell agreed. However, by the time he had returned, the war was virtually over. He commanded South-Eastern District from July to September 1856. For his services in the Crimean War, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Sardinian Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus on 11 August 1856 and the Turkish Order of the Medjidie, 1st Class, on 2 March 1858. The Board of Directors of the East India Company also granted Campbell an annuity (a life-long annual payment) of £2,000 on 9 June 1858.

===Commander-in-Chief of India===

On 11 July 1857, at an early stage in the Indian Mutiny, Lord Palmerston offered Campbell the command of all British forces in India. Promoted to the local rank of full general in India the same day, he left England the next day and reached Calcutta in August 1857. He relieved and then evacuated Lucknow in November 1857 and, after attacking and decisively defeating Tantia Tope at the Second Battle of Cawnpore in December 1857, he captured Lucknow again in March 1858. He was promoted to the substantive rank of full general on 14 May 1858 and raised to the peerage as Baron Clyde, of Clydesdale in Scotland on 3 August 1858. In Autumn 1858, faced with a further mutiny by the East India Company&#x27;s European troops, who had not received their enlistment bounties, he used British troops to enforce discipline until the British Cabinet agreed to some concessions. He continued in charge of the operations in India until all aspects of the revolt had died away and then returned to England in June 1860.

==Retirement and memorials==
In retirement he lived at 10 Berkeley Square in London. Promoted to field marshal on 9 November 1862, he died at Chatham on 14 August 1863, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. His monument was sculpted by Thomas Gaffin.

A statue of Campbell by Carlo Marochetti was erected in Waterloo Place in London in 1867. Another statue of him by John Foley was erected in George Square in Glasgow the following year.

There is a public house in Kilburn High Road, North West London, named after Sir Colin Campbell of the same name. It is an Irish pub but the building has operated as a tavern (in his name) for more than 100 years.

==Family==
Campbell never married, or fathered any children.

<text>Seán Mac Eoin (30 September 1893 – 7 July 1973) was an Irish republican and later Fine Gael politician who was Minister for Defence briefly in 1951 and from 1954 to 1957, and Minister for Justice from 1948 to 1951. He had been Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces from February 1929 to October 1929. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1921 to 1923 and from 1929 to 1965.

He was commonly referred to as the &quot;Blacksmith of Ballinalee&quot;.

==Early life==
He was born John Joseph McKeon on 30 September 1893 at Bunlahy, Granard, County Longford, the eldest son of Andrew McKeon and Katherine Treacy. After a national school education, he trained as a blacksmith at his father&#x27;s forge and, on his father&#x27;s death in February 1913, he took over the running of the forge and the maintenance of the McKeon family. He moved to Kilinshley in the Ballinalee district of County Longford to set up a new forge.

He had joined the United Irish League in 1908. Mac Eoin&#x27;s Irish nationalist activities began in earnest in 1913, when he joined the Clonbroney Company of the Irish Volunteers. Late that year he was sworn into the Irish Republican Brotherhood and joined the Granard circle of the organization.

MacEoin was a member of the Knights of Saint Columbanus.

==IRA leader==

Mac Eoin came to prominence in the Irish War of Independence as leader of a flying column of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). In November 1920, he led the Longford Brigade in an attack against British forces in Granard when they were carrying out a reprisal attack, forcing them to retreat to their barracks. On 31 October, Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) district-inspector Philip Kelleher was shot dead in Granard, and the Auxiliary Division proceeded to set fire to parts of the town. The next day, Mac Eoin held the village of Ballinalee situated on the Longford Road between Longford and Granard. They defended their position against superior forces, forcing them to retreat and abandon their ammunition. In a separate attack on 8 November, Mac Eoin led his men against the RIC at Ballinalee which killed an eighteen-year-old constable and wounded three others. The small RIC garrison allegedly sang &quot;God Save the King&quot; as they took up positions to return fire.

On the afternoon of 7 January 1921, a joint RIC-British Army patrol consisting of eleven policemen and nine soldiers arrived on the street outside the home of Anne Martin in Kilshruley, where MacEoin was staying. Mac Eoin&#x27;s own testimony at his trial (which was not contested by any parties present) states that:
 The RIC officer Mac Eoin killed was district-inspector Thomas McGrath; he also wounded a police constable as well.

On 2 February 1921, the Longford Brigade ambushed an Auxiliary Division detachment at Clonfin using a mine. Two lorries were involved, the first blown up, the second strafed by rapid rifle fire. District-inspector Worthington Craven was hit by two bullets and killed. District Inspector Taylor was shot in the chest and stomach. Four auxiliaries and a driver were killed and eight wounded. The IRA volunteers captured 18 rifles, 20 revolvers and a Lewis gun. At the Clonfin Ambush, Mac Eoin ordered his men to care for wounded prisoners of war at the expense of captured weaponry. This earned him both praise and criticism, but became a big propaganda boost for the IRA&#x27;s efforts, especially in the United States. He was admired by many within the IRA for leading practically the only effective column in the midlands. In July 1920, he was among the majority of commanders who were prepared to sign the Agreement recognizing the Volunteers as the Army of the Republic. The Oath of Allegiance was &quot;for the purpose of ratifying under the Agreement under which the Volunteers came under the control of the Dail&quot;.

Mac Eoin was captured at Mullingar railway station in March 1921, imprisoned and sentenced to death for the murder of McGrath. His family home was near Currygrane, County Longford, which was also the family home of Sir Henry Wilson, the British CIGS. In June 1921, Wilson was petitioned for clemency by Mac Eoin&#x27;s mother (who referred to her son as &quot;John&quot; in her letter), by his own brother Jemmy and by the local Church of Ireland vicar, and passed on the appeals out of respect for the latter two individuals. Three 
members of the Auxiliary Division had already given character references on his behalf after he had treated them chivalrously at the Clonfin ambush in February 1921. However, Nevil Macready, the Commander-in-Chief, Ireland, confirmed the death sentence; he described Mac Eoin as &quot;nothing more than a murderer&quot; who was probably responsible for other &quot;atrocities&quot;, but also later recorded in his memoirs that Mac Eoin was the only IRA man he had met, apart from Michael Collins, to have a sense of humour. His second-in-command was from North Roscommon. Sean Connolly had a colourful career as head of Leitrim brigade.

Mac Eoin wrote the following letter to his friend (and classmate at Moyne Latin School) Father Jim Sheridan, a combatant in the Old IRA and a &#x27;flying column&#x27; member, who had been ordained and sent to Milwaukee to study theology:
According to Oliver St. John Gogarty, Charles Bewley wrote Mac Eoin&#x27;s death-sentence speech. Michael Collins organised a rescue attempt. Six IRA members, led by Paddy Daly and Emmet Dalton, captured an armoured car and, wearing British Army uniforms, gained access to Mountjoy Prison. However, Mac Eoin was not in the part of the jail they believed, and after a gunfight broke out, the party retreated.

Within days, Mac Eoin was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1921 general election, as a TD for Longford–Westmeath.
He was eventually released from prison — along with all other members of the Dáil, after Collins threatened to break off treaty negotiations with the British government unless he were freed. It was rumoured that Sean Mac Eoin was to be the best man at Collins&#x27; wedding.

==Treaty and the Civil War==
In the debate on the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Mac Eoin seconded Arthur Griffith&#x27;s motion that it should be accepted.

Mac Eoin joined the National Army and was appointed GOC Western Command in June 1922. During the Civil War he pacified the west of Ireland for the new Free State, marching overland to Castlebar and linking up with a seaborne expedition that landed at Westport, County Mayo. He was one of a number of Free State generals whom IRA deputy commander Ernie O&#x27;Malley ordered to be shot on sight for ill-treating prisoners.

Mac Eoin was later appointed to head the Curragh training camp in August 1925, quartermaster general in March 1927 and chief of staff in February 1929.

==Political career==

He resigned from the Army in 1929 and was elected at a by-election to Dáil Éireann for the Leitrim–Sligo constituency, representing Cumann na nGaedheal. At the 1932 general election, he returned to the constituency of Longford–Westmeath, and—with the merging of Cumann na nGaedheal into Fine Gael—continued to serve the Longford area as TD in either Longford–Westmeath (1932–37, 1948–65) or Athlone–Longford (1937–48) until he was defeated at the 1965 general election.

During a long political career he served as Minister for Justice (February 1948 – March 1951) and Minister for Defence (March–June 1951) in the First Inter-Party Government, and again as Minister for Defence (June 1954 – March 1957) in the Second Inter-Party Government.

He unsuccessfully stood twice as candidate for the office of President of Ireland, against Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly in 1945 and Éamon de Valera in 1959.

Mac Eoin retired from public life after the 1965 general election and died on 7 July 1973. He married Alice Cooney on 21 June 1922, at a ceremony attended by Griffith and Collins; she died on 16 February 1985. They had no children.

==Legacy==

On 16 June 2013, during the &#x27;General Sean MacEoin Commemoration Weekend&#x27;, a statue of Mac Eoin was unveiled in his home town of Ballinalee; on the same day a plaque was unveiled in Bunlahy, his birthplace. Both the statue and the plaque were unveiled by Enda Kenny, the then Taoiseach, who laid a wreath at the statue.

The forge that he worked in is still standing and is known as &#x27;Mac Eoin forge&#x27;.

The attempt at freeing him from jail is referenced in the Jack Higgins novel &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot;.

<doc id="277361" wikidata="Q470736" url="?curid=277361" title="Noël Browne">
<text>Noël Christopher Browne (20 December 1915 – 21 May 1997) was an Irish politician who served as Minister for Health from 1948 to 1951 and Leader of the National Progressive Democrats from 1958 to 1963. He was a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1948 to 1954, 1957 to 1973 and 1977 to 1982, and held a Senate seat for the Dublin University constituency from 1973 to 1977.

He holds the distinction of being one of only seven TDs to be appointed to the cabinet on the start of their first term in the Dáil. As Minister for Health, Browne is credited with waging a successful total war on tuberculosis. However, his attempt to implement the Mother and Child Scheme in effect brought down the First Inter-Party Government of Taoiseach John A. Costello in 1951 and remains one of the greatest political controversies in modern Irish political history.

Browne was a well-known but at times, controversial, public representative and managed to be a TD for five political parties (two of which he co-founded), as well as an independent TD. These were Clann na Poblachta (resigned), Fianna Fáil (expelled), National Progressive Democrats (co-founder), Labour Party (resigned) and the Socialist Labour Party (co-founder). Browne is widely acknowledged to have had a propensity for grudges and feuds. However, he is also widely credited as being a progressive force in Ireland who advocated against corporal punishment and apartheid while supporting contraceptives, abortion and the LGBT community many decades before those positions became mainstream.

==Early life and career==
Noël Browne was born at Bath Street in Waterford, but grew up in the Bogside area of Derry. The Browne family also lived in Athlone and Ballinrobe for a period of time. His mother Mary Therese (née Cooney) was born in 1885 in Hollymount, County Mayo; a plaque has been erected there in her memory. His father Joseph Brown, an RIC sergeant, later worked as an inspector for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and, partly as a result of this work, all of the Browne family became infected with tuberculosis. Both parents died of the disease during the 1920s; his father was the first to die, leaving only £100 behind to support his wife and seven children. Fearing that if she and the children remained in Ireland that they would be forced into a workhouse, Mary (already by this point dying of TB) sold every possession the Brownes had and took the family to London, England. Within two days of their arrival, Mary was dead, later buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave. Of her seven children, six contracted tuberculosis. Noël was only one of two Browne children to survive into adulthood after those bouts with TB. The only sibling who survived with him was his brother Jody, who developed both a hunchback and a cleft palate. Because of Jody&#x27;s conditions, Noël described Jody as &quot;completely unwanted&quot; by society, which led his sister to commit Jody to a workhouse. There, Jody later died on an operating table when, in Noël&#x27;s own words, a doctor performed &quot;experimental&quot; plastic surgery on Jody. Jody too was buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave.

In 1929, he was admitted free of charge to St Anthony&#x27;s, a preparatory school in Eastbourne. He then won a scholarship to Beaumont College, the Jesuit public school near Old Windsor, Berkshire, where he befriended Neville Chance, a wealthy boy from Dublin. Neville, son of surgeon Sir Arthur Gerard Chance, subsequently paid Browne&#x27;s way through medical school at Trinity College Dublin.

In 1940, while still a student, Browne suffered a serious relapse of tuberculosis. His treatment at a sanatorium in Midhurst, Sussex, was paid for by the Chance family. He recovered, passed his medical exams in 1942, and started his career as a medical intern at Dr Steevens&#x27; Hospital in Dublin, where he worked under Bethel Solomons He subsequently worked in numerous sanatoria throughout Ireland and England, witnessing the ravages of the disease. He soon concluded that politics was the only way in which he could make an attack on the scourge of tuberculosis.

===Entry into politics===
The poverty and tragedy that had shaped Browne&#x27;s childhood deeply affected him. He considered both his survival and his level of education a complete fluke, a stroke of random chance that saved him when he was seemingly destined to die unknown and in poverty like the rest of his family. Browne found this completely distasteful and was moved to enter politics as a means to ensure no one else would suffer the same fate that had befallen his family.

Browne joined the new Irish republican party Clann na Poblachta and was elected to Dáil Éireann for the Dublin South-East constituency at the 1948 general election. To the surprise of many, party leader Seán MacBride chose Browne to be one of the party&#x27;s two ministers in the new government. Browne became one of the few TDs appointed a Minister on their first day in Dáil Éireann, when he was appointed Minister for Health.

==Minister for Health==
A White paper on proposed healthcare reforms had been prepared by the previous government and resulted in the 1947 Health Act. In February 1948, Browne became Minister for Health and started the reforms advocated by the Paper and introduced by the Act.

The health reforms coincided with the development of a new vaccine and of new drugs (e.g. BCG and penicillin) that helped to treat a previously untreatable group of medical conditions. Browne introduced mass free screening for tuberculosis sufferers and launched a huge construction programme to build new hospitals and sanitoria, financed by the income and accumulated investments from the Health Department-controlled Hospital Sweeps funds. This, along with the introduction of Streptomycin, helped dramatically reduce the incidence of tuberculosis in Ireland.

As Minister for Health Browne came into conflict with the bishops of the Catholic Church and the medical profession over the Mother and Child Scheme. This plan, also introduced by the 1947 Health Act, provided free state-funded healthcare for all mothers and children aged under 16, with no means test, a move which was regarded as radical at the time in Ireland, but not in the rest of Europe. Virtually all doctors in private practice opposed the scheme, because it would undermine the &quot;fee for service&quot; model on which their income depended.

The Church hierarchy, which controlled many hospitals, vigorously opposed the expansion of &quot;socialised medicine&quot; in the Republic of Ireland (though they never objected to its provision via the British National Health Service in Northern Ireland). They claimed that the Mother and Child Scheme interfered with parental rights and feared that the provision of non-religious medical advice to mothers would lead to birth control contrary to Catholic teaching. They greatly disliked Browne, seeing him as a &quot;Trinity Catholic&quot; (one who had defied the Church&#x27;s ruling that the faithful should not attend Trinity College Dublin, which had been founded by Protestants and for many years did not allow Catholics to study there).

Under pressure from bishops, the coalition government backed away from the Mother and Child Scheme and forced Browne&#x27;s resignation as Minister for Health.

He gave his version of events in his resignation speech to the Dáil on 12 April 1951. In particular, he deplored that the government had referred his Scheme to the Church for approval, taking care to describe it to the Church as his plan and not as government policy, giving him no option but to resign as Minister. The Taoiseach, John A. Costello, immediately retorted that &quot;I have seldom listened to a statement in which there were so many — let me say it as charitably as possible — inaccuracies, misstatements and misrepresentations&quot;, and delivered his full reply several hours later. Following his departure from government, Browne embarrassed his opponents by arranging for &quot;The Irish Times&quot; to publish Costello&#x27;s and MacBride&#x27;s correspondence with the Catholic hierarchy, which detailed their capitulation to the bishops.

The controversy over the Mother and Child Scheme led to the fall of the coalition government in which Browne had served as a Minister. But Church opposition to &quot;socialised medicine&quot; continued under the subsequent Fianna Fáil-led government. The hierarchy would not accept a no-means-test mother-and-infant scheme even when Fianna Fáil reduced the age limit from sixteen years to six weeks, and the government again backed down.

==Later political career==

After his resignation as Minister for Health, Browne left Clann na Poblachta, but was re-elected to the Dáil as an Independent TD from Dublin South-East in the subsequent election.

Browne joined Fianna Fáil in 1953, but lost his Dáil seat at the 1954 general election. He failed to be selected as a candidate for the 1957 general election and he resigned from the party. He was re-elected at that election for Dublin South-East as an Independent TD.

In 1958, he founded the National Progressive Democrats with Jack McQuillan. Browne held on to his seat at the 1961 general election, but in 1963, he and McQuillan joined the Labour Party, disbanding the National Progressive Democrats. However, Browne lost his seat at the 1965 general election.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Browne became a vocal opponent of Apartheid in South Africa; In 1970 Browne was amongst those who protested outside Thomond Park in Limerick and Lansdowne Road in Dublin when Ireland played the South African rugby team. Browne publicly called for a &quot;progressively expanding boycott on the importation of South African produce, as advocated by the ANC&quot;.

He was re-elected as a Labour Party TD at the 1969 general election, again for Dublin South-East. He did not seek a nomination by the Labour Party for the 1973 general election, but instead won a seat in Seanad Éireann for Dublin University. He remained in the Seanad until the 1977 general election, when he gained the Dublin Artane seat as an Independent Labour TD, having again failed to get the Party nomination.

In 1977 Browne was the first Irish parliamentarian to call for law reforms in regards to homosexuality, which was illegal at the time, and in 1979 was one of the few Irish politicians to attend the opening of the Hirschfeld Centre, Dublin&#x27;s first full-time LGBT community space. In 2021 Leo Varadkar suggested that during Browne&#x27;s time in the Seanad, Browne was the first member of the Oireachtas to ever to advocate for therapeutic legal abortion.

Upon its formation, Browne joined the new Socialist Labour Party and was briefly its only TD, securing election for Dublin North-Central at the 1981 general election. Browne retired from politics at the February 1982 general election.

==Offer of presidential candidacy==
Dick Spring, the Labour Party leader, had made clear early in January 1990 his conviction that there should be a contest for the presidency and even offered to stand himself if no other candidate was forthcoming for the presidential election. While Spring tried to enlist Mary Robinson, a barrister and former senator, she initially was reluctant to rejoin the party. Browne became an apparent second candidate to consider. Almost immediately, those around Spring were &quot;appalled&quot; at the idea of running Browne, believing he had &quot;little or no respect for the party&quot; and &quot;was likely in any event to self-destruct as a candidate.&quot; Spring was determined to move quickly and got the Parliamentary Labour Party to endorse a proposal of having Robinson for consideration at its meeting on April 4. 22 days later, Browne&#x27;s candidacy was defeated at a joint meeting of the PLP and Labour&#x27;s Administrative Council on a reported margin of &quot;at least 4:1.&quot; When Spring informed Browne by telephone that the party&#x27;s Administrative Council had chosen Robinson over him, Browne hung up the telephone. 

During the campaign he also indicated support for the rival Fine Gael candidate, Austin Currie. Robinson would go on to win the election, thus becoming the seventh President of Ireland. Browne spent the remaining seven years of his life constantly criticising her, whether that involved calling the presidency an &quot;impotent, titular post&quot; or reacting to Robinson placing a symbolic lamp in the window of her official residence upon election (as a reminder of all of those forced to leave Ireland to seek work) in a letter to family by stating, &quot;May one grieving Irish family, among those bidding farewell and those left behind, tell our roving president her fatuous, low-watt, low-powered, `cheapest available, warmly welcoming electrical&#x27; candle brought no comfort to our diaspora and could now, permanently, be switched off.&quot;

==Personality==
Few figures in 20th-century Ireland were as controversial as Noël Browne. To his supporters he was a dynamic liberal who stood up to conservative and reactionary Catholicism. To his opponents he was an unstable, temperamental and difficult individual who was the author of most of his own misfortune. Browne further alienated the middle ground in 1986, with the publishing of his autobiography &quot;Against the Tide&quot;, which became what the &quot;Irish Times&quot; called a &quot;publishing sensation&quot; and sold over 80,000 copies in short order. Historians like Dr. Ruth Barrington, who had written extensively about Irish health policy and had access to the files from the 1940s and 1950s, questioned the book&#x27;s reliability.

Writing a decade later, one of the chief officials of the Labour Party, Fergus Finlay, said Browne had developed into a &quot;bad tempered and curmudgeonly old man&quot;. Historian and political scientist Maurice Manning wrote that Browne &quot;had the capacity to inspire fierce loyalty, but many of those who worked with and against him over the years found him difficult, self-centred, unwilling to accept the good faith of his opponents and often profoundly unfair in his intolerance of those who disagreed with him&quot;.

However, some of this alleged &quot;difficulty&quot; arose from the fact that Browne was deaf in one ear from an infection. A riposte to these depictions appeared in 2000, based on a much earlier extensive interview with Browne.

After retiring from politics, Browne moved with his wife Phyllis to Baile na hAbhann, County Galway, where he died on 21 May 1997, aged 81.

==Legacy==
In a 2010 RTÉ public poll, he came in the top 10 of Ireland&#x27;s Greatest.

In 2021 Leo Varadkar gave a dedicated lecture on Browne to students of Trinity College Dublin, in which he summarised Browne&#x27;s career. Varadkar noted Browne&#x27;s cantankerous reputation but generally praised Browne, with Varadkar stating that he always &quot;admired his idealism, his passion, and his determination to stand up for the causes and the people he believed in&quot;.

<text>James Silk Buckingham (25 August 1786 – 30 June 1855) was a British author, journalist and traveller, known for his contributions to Indian journalism. He was a pioneer among the Europeans who fought for a liberal press in India.

==Early life==
Buckingham was born at Flushing near Falmouth on 25 August 1786, the son of Thomasine Hambly of Bodmin and Christopher Buckingham (died 1793/94) of Barnstaple. His father, and his ancestors, were seafaring men. James was the youngest of three boys and four girls and his youth was spent at sea. The property of his deceased parents consisted of houses, land, mines and shares, which was left to the three youngest children. In 1797 he was captured by the French and held as a prisoner of war at Corunna.

==Career==
In 1821, his &quot;Travels in Palestine&quot; was published, followed by &quot;Travels Among the Arab Tribes&quot; in 1825. After years of wandering he settled in India, where he established a periodical, the &quot;Calcutta Journal&quot;, in 1818. This venture at first proved highly successful, but in 1823 the paper&#x27;s outspoken criticisms of the East India Company led to the expulsion of Buckingham from India and to the suppression of the paper by John Adam, the acting governor-general in 1823. His case was brought before a select committee of the House of Commons in 1834, and a pension of £500 a year was subsequently awarded to him by the East India Company as compensation.

Buckingham continued his journalistic ventures on his return to England; he settled at Cornwall Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park, and started the &quot;Oriental Herald and Colonial Review&quot; (1824–9) and the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; (1828) which was not a success in his hands, Buckingham selling to John Sterling after a few weeks.

Between 1832 and 1836 Buckingham served as MP for Sheffield. He was a strong advocate of social reform, calling for the end of flogging in the armed services, abolition of the press-gang and the repeal of the Corn Laws. In 1833 he promoted the law that would abolish slavery across the British empire.

During his time as an MP, Buckingham served as chair of the select committee charged with examining &quot;the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the laboring classes of the United Kingdom&quot; devise a solution. Campaigner for the working class Francis Place concluded that the lack of &quot;parish libraries and direct reading rooms, and popular lecture that were both entertaining and instructive&quot; were drawing individuals to frequent &quot;public houses for other social enjoyment&quot;. With this in mind, Buckingham introduced the Public Institutions bill in 1835. Buckingham&#x27;s bill allowed boroughs to charge a tax to set up libraries and museums. This bill never became law but would serve as inspiration for William Ewart and Joseph Brotherton, who introduced a bill that would &quot;[empower] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a ½d for the establishment of museums&quot;. Ewart and Brotherton&#x27;s bill would become the basis for the Museums Act 1845.

Following his retirement from parliament, in October 1837, Buckingham began a four-year tour of North America, resulting in another travel novel, &quot;A Journey Through the Slave States of North America&quot; in which, among other matters, he advocates that the United States follow the British example and abolish slavery. In 1844 he was central to the foundation of the British and Foreign Institute in Hanover Square.

He was a prolific writer. He had travelled in Europe, America and the East, and wrote many useful travel books, as well as many pamphlets on political and social subjects. &quot;In 1851, the value of these and of his other literary works was recognized by the grant of a Civil List pension of £200 a year. At the time of his death in London, Buckingham was at work on his autobiography, two volumes of the intended four being completed and published (1855)&quot;. This work is important as it mentions in detail the life of the black composer Joseph Antonio Emidy who settled in Truro.

==Personal life==
In February 1806, Buckingham married Elizabeth Jennings (1786–1865), the daughter of a Cornish farmer.

Buckingham died after a long illness at Stanhope Lodge, Upper Avenue Road, St John&#x27;s Wood, London, on 30 June 1855. Buckingham is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

His youngest son, Leicester Silk Buckingham, was a popular playwright.

<text>Mira Katherine Sorvino (; born ) is an American actress. She won the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; (1995).

She also starred in the films &quot;Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot; (1997), &quot;Mimic&quot; (1997), &quot;Lulu on the Bridge&quot; (1998), &quot;The Replacement Killers&quot; (1998), &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; (1999), &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; (2003), &quot;Like Dandelion Dust&quot; (2009), and &quot;Sound of Freedom&quot; (2023). For her work in television, she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe in &quot;Norma Jean &amp; Marilyn&quot; (1996) and nominated twice for a Golden Globe for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film for her performance as Detective Kate Morozov and for her leading role in &quot;Human Trafficking&quot; (2005).

== Early life ==
Sorvino was born on September 28, 1967, in Manhattan, New York City, to Lorraine Ruth Davis, a drama therapist for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease patients and former actress, and Paul Sorvino, an actor and film director. She has two siblings, Michael Sorvino and Amanda. She is of Italian descent on her father&#x27;s side.

She was raised in Tenafly, New Jersey, where she wrote and acted in backyard plays with her childhood friend Hope Davis, and in theater productions at Dwight-Englewood School. As a child, she was strongly influenced to pursue social causes by her mother, who participated in the March on Washington. Sorvino excelled in high school and was accepted into Harvard University. She studied for one year as an exchange student with CIEE in Nanjing, China, where she studied Mandarin Chinese. In 1989, she graduated from Harvard &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a degree in East Asian studies. She also helped found the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones, one of Harvard&#x27;s co-ed &quot;a cappella&quot; groups, in 1985.

== Career ==

Sorvino&#x27;s first major screen appearance was in the teen television series &quot;Swans Crossing&quot;, where she appeared in six episodes. When the 1993 film &quot;Amongst Friends&quot; entered preproduction, she was hired as third assistant director, then promoted to casting director, then to assistant producer, and finally offered a lead role. The positive reviews she received led to more acting opportunities.

After supporting roles in Robert Redford&#x27;s &quot;Quiz Show&quot; and Whit Stillman&#x27;s &quot;Barcelona&quot;, she was cast in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; (1995). Her portrayal of a happy-go-lucky prostitute made her a star, winning her an Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress. Although the film brought her international recognition, she described its shooting as extremely stressful: &quot;I was absolutely neurotic doing &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot;,&quot; she recalled. &quot;Every night brought a new nervous breakdown. I&#x27;d cry and talk to God, I was so nervous. Then the next day, I&#x27;d show up and do my scenes.&quot;

Her other credits include &quot;Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot; with Lisa Kudrow, &quot;At First Sight&quot; with Val Kilmer, and Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Summer of Sam&quot;. She portrayed Marilyn Monroe for the 1996 HBO film &quot;Norma Jean &amp; Marilyn&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe; and had the lead role in Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s horror film &quot;Mimic&quot;. In 1995, she portrayed Conchita Closson in the BBC miniseries &quot;The Buccaneers&quot;, based on Edith Wharton&#x27;s last novel. She starred as Daisy Buchanan in the 2000 television film &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;.
In 2002, Sorvino appeared as the lead in &quot;The Triumph of Love&quot;, an adaptation of the 1732 Marivaux play. That year she also starred in &quot;WiseGirls&quot; alongside Mariah Carey and Melora Walters. In 2006, she received a Golden Globe nomination for her role as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in the Lifetime film &quot;Human Trafficking&quot;. She had a supporting role in the drama &quot;Reservation Road&quot; (2007) with Mark Ruffalo.

In February 2008, she guest-starred as psychiatrist Cate Milton in the &quot;Frozen&quot; episode of the medical television drama &quot;House&quot;. Plans to make hers a recurring character were interrupted by the writers&#x27; strike.
She starred in &quot;Attack on Leningrad&quot; (2009), &quot;Multiple Sarcasms&quot; (2010) with Timothy Hutton and Stockard Channing, and Nancy Savoca&#x27;s &quot;Union Square&quot; (2012), with Patti Lupone and Tammy Blanchard. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to good reviews. In the same year, Sorvino played the mother of the lead in the film adaptation of Wendy Mass&#x27;s popular children&#x27;s book &quot;Jeremy Fink and the Meaning of Life&quot;.

In 2014, she reappeared as Head Detective Betsy Brannigan on the final season of &quot;Psych&quot;, and on the fourth season of &quot;Falling Skies&quot; as John Pope&#x27;s love interest, Sara. Sorvino also joined the cast of the television series &quot;Intruders&quot;, playing the role of Amy Whelan. In 2016, she appeared in the Netflix series &quot;Lady Dynamite&quot; as an actor working on a sitcom pilot named &quot;White Trash&quot;. In 2018, Sorvino played the role of Amy in the psychological thriller &quot;Look Away&quot;, alongside Jason Isaacs and India Eisley.

In 2019, Sorvino was cast in the Netflix miniseries &quot;Hollywood&quot; as an actor whose career stalled out after a relationship with a studio head.

In 2022, she played a supporting role in &quot;Sound of Freedom&quot;, a film about human trafficking in South America.

== Personal life ==
Between 1996 and 1998, Mira Sorvino was romantically involved with director Quentin Tarantino, who was her escort to the Academy Awards ceremony where she won Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot;.
Sorvino met actor Christopher Backus at a friend&#x27;s charades party in August 2003. On June 11, 2004, they married in a private civil ceremony at the Santa Barbara, California, courthouse, then later had a hilltop ceremony in Capri, Italy. They have four children: two daughters and two sons. They have also starred in films together such as &quot;Indiscretion&quot; and &quot;Mothers and Daughters&quot;.

In honor of Sorvino&#x27;s role as Susan Tyler, an entomologist who investigated deadly insect mutations in the film &quot;Mimic&quot;, a compound that is excreted as a defense mechanism by the sunburst diving beetle was named &quot;mirasorvone&quot; by the entomologist Thomas Eisner who discovered it.

In September 2014, Sorvino gave a wide-ranging interview on &quot;The Nerdist Podcast&quot;, where she discussed her education, living in China, and her varied interests. She is a Christian and resides with her family in Los Angeles, California.

In 2017, Sorvino came out publicly about the sexual harassment she endured from producer Harvey Weinstein and believes her career was damaged after she rebuffed Weinstein&#x27;s advances. According to Peter Jackson, Weinstein blocked Sorvino and Ashley Judd, another of his alleged victims, from being considered for parts in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films. In 2019 she also made public that she was a date rape victim.

===Activism===
Sorvino has been affiliated with Amnesty International since 2004. In 2006 she was honored with their Artist of Conscience Award, given to those who have made longstanding philanthropic and humanist efforts. From 2009 to 2012 she was a United Nations Goodwill ambassador for combatting human trafficking, and has lobbied Congress to help abolish the practice in Darfur.

<text>A mudpot, or mud pool, is a type of acidic hot spring, or fumarole, with limited water. It usually takes the form of a pool of bubbling mud, as a result of the acid and microorganisms decomposing surrounding rock into clay and mud.

==Description==
The mud of a mudpot takes the form of a viscous, often bubbling, slurry. As the boiling mud is often squirted over the brims of the mudpot, a form resembling a mini-volcano of mud starts to build up, sometimes reaching heights of . Although mudpots are often called &quot;mud volcanoes&quot;, true mud volcanoes are very different in nature. The mud of a mudpot is generally of white to greyish color, but is sometimes stained with reddish or pink spots from iron compounds. When the slurry is particularly colorful, the feature may be referred to as a paint pot.

==Geology==
Mudpots form in high-temperature geothermal areas where water supply is short. The little water that is available rises to the surface at a spot where the soil is rich in volcanic ash, clay, and other fine particulates. The thickness of the mud usually changes along with seasonal changes in the water table.

==Notable sites==
The geothermal areas of Yellowstone National Park contain several notable examples of both mudpots and paint pots, as do some areas of Azerbaijan, Iceland, New Zealand and Nicaragua. 

Several locations in and around the Salton Sea in California are also home to active mudpots, including the moving Niland Geyser. In the case of Niland Geyser, its name is somewhat of a misnomer, as the release of carbon dioxide by seismic activity from the nearby San Andreas Fault is responsible for its behaviour, rather than through geothermal activity. The fluid contained within it is near ambient atmospheric temperature, rather than boiling, measuring around .

<doc id="277379" wikidata="Q1352827" url="?curid=277379" title="Margin of error">
<text>The margin of error is a statistic expressing the amount of random sampling error in the results of a survey. The larger the margin of error, the less confidence one should have that a poll result would reflect the result of a census of the entire population. The margin of error will be positive whenever a population is incompletely sampled and the outcome measure has positive variance, which is to say, whenever the measure &quot;varies&quot;.

The term &quot;margin of error&quot; is often used in non-survey contexts to indicate observational error in reporting measured quantities.

== Concept ==
Consider a simple &quot;yes/no&quot; poll formula_1 as a sample of formula_2 respondents drawn from a population formula_3 reporting the percentage formula_4 of &quot;yes&quot; responses. We would like to know how close formula_4 is to the true result of a survey of the entire population formula_6, without having to conduct one. If, hypothetically, we were to conduct a poll formula_1 over subsequent samples of formula_2 respondents (newly drawn from formula_6), we would expect those subsequent results formula_10 to be normally distributed about formula_11, the true but unknown percentage of the population. The &quot;margin of error&quot; describes the distance within which a specified percentage of these results is expected to vary from formula_11.

Going by the Central limit theorem, the margin of error helps to explain how the distribution of sample means (or percentage of yes, in this case) will approximate a normal distribution as sample size increases. If this applies, it would speak about the sampling being unbiased, but not about the inherent distribution of the data.

According to the 68-95-99.7 rule, we would expect that 95% of the results formula_10 will fall within &quot;about&quot; two standard deviations (formula_14) either side of the true mean formula_11.  This interval is called the confidence interval, and the &quot;radius&quot; (half the interval) is called the &quot;margin of error&quot;, corresponding to a 95% &quot;confidence level&quot;.

Generally, at a confidence level formula_16, a sample sized formula_2 of a population having expected standard deviation formula_18 has a margin of error

:formula_19

where formula_20 denotes the &quot;quantile&quot; (also, commonly, a &quot;z-score&quot;), and formula_21 is the standard error.

== Standard deviation and standard error ==
We would expect the average of normally distributed values  formula_10 to have a standard deviation which somehow varies with formula_2. The smaller formula_2, the wider the margin. This is called the standard error formula_25.

For the single result from our survey, we &quot;assume&quot; that formula_26, and that &quot;all&quot; subsequent results formula_10 together would have a variance formula_28.

: formula_29

Note that formula_30 corresponds to the variance of a Bernoulli distribution.

== Maximum margin of error at different confidence levels ==
For a confidence &quot;level&quot; formula_16, there is a corresponding confidence &quot;interval&quot; about the mean formula_32, that is, the interval formula_33 within which values of formula_1 should fall with probability formula_16. Precise values of formula_36 are given by the quantile function of the normal distribution (which the 68–95–99.7 rule approximates).

Note that formula_36 is undefined for formula_38, that is, formula_39 is undefined, as is formula_40.

Since formula_41 at formula_42, we can arbitrarily set formula_43, calculate formula_44, formula_25, and formula_46 to obtain the &quot;maximum&quot; margin of error for formula_1 at a given confidence level formula_16 and sample size formula_2, even before having actual results.  With formula_50

:formula_51
:formula_52

Also, usefully, for any reported formula_53

:formula_54

== Specific margins of error ==

If a poll has multiple percentage results (for example, a poll measuring a single multiple-choice preference), the result closest to 50% will have the highest margin of error. Typically, it is this number that is reported as the margin of error for the entire poll. Imagine poll formula_1 reports formula_56 as formula_57

:formula_58 (as in the figure above)

:formula_59

:formula_60

As a given percentage approaches the extremes of 0% or 100%, its margin of error approaches ±0%.

== Comparing percentages ==
Imagine multiple-choice poll formula_1 reports formula_56 as formula_63. As described above, the margin of error reported for the poll would typically be formula_64, as formula_65 is closest to 50%. The popular notion of &quot;statistical tie&quot; or &quot;statistical dead heat,&quot; however, concerns itself not with the accuracy of the individual results, but with that of the &quot;ranking&quot; of the results. Which is in first?

If, hypothetically, we were to conduct a poll formula_1 over subsequent samples of formula_2 respondents (newly drawn from formula_6), and report the result formula_69, we could use the &quot;standard error of difference&quot; to understand how formula_70 is expected to fall about formula_71. For this, we need to apply the &quot;sum of variances&quot; to obtain a new variance, formula_72,

:formula_73

where formula_74 is the covariance of formula_75 and formula_76.

Thus (after simplifying),

:formula_77

:formula_78

:formula_79

Note that this assumes that formula_80 is close to constant, that is, respondents choosing either A or B would almost never choose C (making formula_75 and formula_76 close to &quot;perfectly negatively correlated&quot;). With three or more choices in closer contention, choosing a correct formula for formula_83 becomes more complicated.

== Effect of finite population size ==
The formulae above for the margin of error assume that there is an infinitely large population and thus do not depend on the size of population formula_6, but only on the sample size formula_2. According to sampling theory, this assumption is reasonable when the sampling fraction is small. The margin of error for a particular sampling method is essentially the same regardless of whether the population of interest is the size of a school, city, state, or country, as long as the sampling &quot;fraction&quot; is small.

In cases where the sampling fraction is larger (in practice, greater than 5%), analysts might adjust the margin of error using a finite population correction to account for the added precision gained by sampling a much larger percentage of the population. FPC can be calculated using the formula

:formula_86

...and so, if poll formula_1 were conducted over 24% of, say, an electorate of 300,000 voters,
:formula_88
:formula_89

Intuitively, for appropriately large formula_6,

:formula_91
:formula_92

In the former case, formula_2 is so small as to require no correction. In the latter case, the poll effectively becomes a census and sampling error becomes moot.

<text>Saeed Hajjarian (, born 1954) is an Iranian reformist political strategist, journalist, pro-democracy activist and former intelligence officer. He was a member of Tehran&#x27;s city council, and advisor to the president Mohammad Khatami. On 12 March 2000, he was shot in the face by an assailant and severely disabled, an act many Iranians believe was in retaliation for his help in uncovering the chain murders of Iran and his significant help to the Iranian reform movement in general, according to the BBC.

==Early life and education==
Hajjarian was born in Javadiyeh neighborhood of Tehran, Iran in 1954 to parents from Kashan. He studied mechanical engineering at Tehran University. In 1977 Hajjarian was enrolled for military service in Gendarmerie. A young Iranian revolutionary during the 1979 Iranian Revolution, he entered the Islamic Revolution Committees before becoming an Intelligence officer in the Navy. Hajjarian continued his education and obtained a Ph.D. in political science from Tehran University. His thesis advisor was Hossein Bashiriyeh. He was one of the students who took over the US embassy in Tehran in 1979.

==Career==
After the revolution, Hajjarian was involved in the formation of the intelligence apparatus of the newly founded Islamic Republic. Through the 1980s, he worked in the ministry of intelligence, where his positions included vice minister for political affairs. In the late 1980s, he left the church and established Center for Strategic Research under the presidency. That was where he played an essential role in creating a new discourse based on democracy and the rule of law for his generation of revolutionaries.

When Mohammad Khatami was elected president in 1997, he appointed Hajjarian his political advisor. In 1999, he was elected to Tehran&#x27;s city council in the first city elections after the 1979 revolution. Hajjarian was also the editor of &quot;Sobh-e Emrooz&quot; newspaper, which strongly advocated Khatami&#x27;s reforms. He was believed to be the source of information for many articles written by investigative journalists, Akbar Ganji and Emadeddin Baghi. These included stories about the &quot;Chain murders&quot; of dissident intellectuals by members of Iran&#x27;s intelligence ministry.

Hajjarian was one of the vital personal factors of President Khatami. He was a member of the reformist elite and had a leadership support role in the reform movement. He joined the Ministry of Intelligence and national security (MINS) in 1984 and left in 1989. He also worked at the Center of strategic studies. Working in such a place, he invited some of the officials of MINS to join the reform movement. All of them tried to develop the reform movement. People like Akbar Ganji, Mohsen Armin, Abbas Abdi, Hamid Reza Jalaeipour, Muhammad Mousavi Khouiniha, Ebrahim Asghar Zadeh, and Mohsen Sazgaran are among those persons.

== Assassination attempt ==

In March 2000, a gunman shot him in the face on the doorstep of Tehran&#x27;s city council. The would-be assassin fled on a motorcycle with an accomplice. The bullet entered his left cheek, lodged in his neck, and put Hajjarian into a coma. During this time, groups of young Iranians kept vigil outside Sina Hospital, where he was being treated. Hajjarian was badly paralyzed for life.

His assailant, Saeed Asgar, a young man reportedly a member of the Basij militia, was later arrested and sentenced to spend 15 years in jail. However, he was released after spending only a short term in prison. Mohsen Morteza Majidi accompanied Asgar on a motorbike. Others, who were involved, include Mohammad Ali Moghaddami, Mehdi Rowghani, Mousa Jan Nesari, Ali Pourchaluei (possibly the one who shot Hajjarian), Saeed Golounani, and Safar Maghsoudi.

===Possible cause===
His attempted assassination is thought to be associated with the exposure of the &quot;Chain murders&quot; in his &quot;Sobh Emrouz&quot; daily newspaper and the &quot;key role&quot; he is believed to have played &quot;in bringing about ... damaging disclosures,&quot; both as the editor of the exposing newspaper and one of the few reformists likely to be a source of information about activity in the intelligence ministry. Consequently, &quot;some believe that remnants&quot; of the chain murder &quot;intelligence killer group may have been&quot; behind his attempted assassination.

===Recovery===
Hajjarian slowly recovered somewhat from the shooting. By 2005, Hajjarian was still unable to speak with a clear voice and still using a wheelchair, although they could walk with help. As of 2009 he still spoke with difficulty. He was &quot;dependent on the constant care of doctors and family.&quot;

== Research works and viewpoints ==
Hajjarian has used the term &quot;dual sovereignty&quot; as an analytic tool to describe the balance of power in the Islamic Republic&#x27;s government system, in which there is a supposed split between the Supreme Leader and popularly elected officials, e.g. the President. The idea was publicly denounced by Ali Khamenei in 2004, being called &quot;damaging and a deadly poison&quot; repeated by &quot;irrational people&quot;.

He believes that a frontal assault on the fortresses of power is impractical. Hajjarian argued that the domination of politics by clerics was wrong but could be gradually eroded by &quot;mobilizing the masses and using them as bargaining chips with Iran&#x27;s rulers.&quot; His strategy for the reform movement was described as extending the reformists &quot;reach by triangulating between the mass movement they represented and the autocratic state with which they shared power. He coined the phrase defining the reformists&#x27; strategy: &quot;&quot;Pressure from below, negotiation at the top&quot;.&quot; The strategy remarks that by developing civil society and winning the battle of public opinion, the reform movement can gain enough strength to not only resist the hardliners but also push for deep changes within the system via bargains with top officials unwilling to reform.

Hajjarian formulated the proposed gradual move to a favorable democratic system as &quot;fortress to fortress triumph&quot;, meaning that reformers should concentrate on weakening and capturing key institutions, i.e. fortresses of power, one by one.

Hajjarian argued that there is a way of combating the predominance of Valiyat al-faqih (rule of the Islamic jurist) by underlining the de facto secularization of religion by the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, Khomeini. He allegedly showed the supremacy of politics as such over any religious norm when he said that the interests of the Islamic Republic are paramount in Islam and that zakat, salat, hajj, and everything else in Islam, are subordinate. This kind of decision, he states, means that politics are more important than religion and that this acknowledges the secularization of religion. In this context, he argues, it is possible to reassess velayat faqih and to reject its supremacy within the political field in Iran.

After reformists lost their &quot;fortresses&quot;, Hajjarian said in 2004 that the reforms program have been failed and now there are multiple choices for the Iranian people. One option is giving up and accepting the current situation. Another choice is apathy, followed by adopting defeatism—waiting for a possible foreign military action against Iran and regime change— or to let the developing lumpenproletariat in the society grow until they ignite a revolution in Iran. Hajjarian prefers what he calls the best alternative, which is to assume &quot;reforms is dead, long live the reforms&quot; and continue the reforms path patiently.

==2009 elections==
On 16 June 2009, four days after the disputed presidential election, it was reported that Hajjarian had been arrested. It was reported that he died in Evin prison under torture on 7 July. However, it was later added that he was still alive but had had a nervous breakdown on 8 July and was in critical condition in a military hospital in Tehran. Later, there were reports that he was still in Evin Prison, possibly in a clinic there, and that according to his wife, physician Vajiheh Marsoussi, his medical condition was &quot;deteriorating severely&quot; while in prison.

==2015 speech==
In May 2015, Hajjarian was allowed to give a short speech at University of Tehran. According to the reformist &quot;Shargh&quot; Daily, enthusiasm for the speech was so great that seats were filled up hours before the event. In a note he gave to a student to read, Hajjarian stated that the 1997 presidential election were the reformists prevailed were the first since the 1979 Iranian revolution in which there was &quot;a competition&quot;, and that it &quot;institutionalized&quot; competition in the presidential elections, and introduced a new debate on the issues of religion, economics, and other foreign and domestic policies. But he believed those elections were an &quot;exception&quot; and doubtful of their repetition, &quot;though he did not explain why&quot;, according to al-Monitor.

<doc id="277385" wikidata="Q702650" url="?curid=277385" title="Premier of the Republic of China">
<text>The Premier of the Republic of China, officially the President of the Executive Yuan (), is the head of government of Taiwan and leader of the Executive Yuan. The premier is nominally the principal advisor to the president and positioned as the head of central government, appointed by the president without approval by the Legislative Yuan. The current president of the Executive Yuan is Cho Jung-tai, who took office on 20 May 2024.

==History==

The predecessor of the president of the Executive Yuan was the prime minister of the Republic of China, and the first president of the Executive Yuan was Tan Yankai; the first president after the promulgation of the 1947 constitution was Weng Wenhao; and the first president to take office after the government relocated to Taiwan was Chen Cheng. 

During Japanese colonial rule over Taiwan, executive power was vested in the governor-general of Taiwan; the post was formed on 10 May 1895 as the governors-general were members of the Diet, civilian officials, Japanese nobles or generals. They exercised their power on behalf of the sovereign of Taiwan (the emperor of Japan) until the dissolution of the empire. Taiwan&#x27;s head of government was then represented by the administration of the Republic of China under T. V. Soong of the Executive Yuan, after the handover in 1945, in which the post was originally founded in 1928 in Mainland China. Weng Wenhao became the first premier in the 1947 Constitution of the Republic of China in both Mainland China and Taiwan, but Yan Xishan also served as premier during the ROC government&#x27;s retreat to Taiwan in 1949. The sovereignty of Taiwan and Penghu was renounced by Japan in 1952.

==Powers and responsibilities==
The premier presides over the Executive Yuan Council, which makes up the official cabinet. The vice premier, ministers, and chairpersons of the Executive Yuan Council are appointed by the president on the recommendation of the premier. The premier&#x27;s official duties also include presenting administrative policies and reports to the legislators, responding to the interpellations of legislators (much like Question Time in some parliamentary systems), and, with the approval of the president, asking the legislators to reconsider its resolutions. Laws and decrees promulgated by the president must also be countersigned by the premier.

In the event of vacancies in both the presidency and the vice presidency, the premier serves as acting president of the republic for up to three months.

One-third of the legislators may initiate a no-confidence vote against the premier. If approved with simple majority, the premier must resign from office within ten days and at the same time may request that the president dissolve the Legislative Yuan. If the motion fails, another no-confidence motion against the same premier cannot be initiated for one year. This power has never been used. In practice, the president has enough legitimacy and executive authority to govern in the face of a legislature controlled by the opposition, and would likely respond to a vote of no-confidence by nominating another person with similar views.

== Premier as head of government ==

The Constitution of the Republic of China did not originally define strictly the relation between the premier and the president of the Republic and it was not clear whether the government would lean towards a presidential system or parliamentary system when divided. Power shifted to Premier Chiang Ching-kuo after President Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s death but shifted to the presidency again when Chiang Ching-kuo became president. After President Lee Teng-hui succeeded Chiang as president in 1988, the power struggle within the Kuomintang extended to the constitutional debate over the relationship between the president and the premier. The first three premiers under Lee, Yu Kuo-hwa, Lee Huan and Hau Pei-tsun, were mainlanders who had initially opposed Lee&#x27;s ascension to power. The appointment of Lee and Hau were compromises by President Lee to placate the conservative mainlander faction in the party. The subsequent appointment of premier Lien Chan was taken as a sign of Lee&#x27;s consolidation of power. Moreover, during this time, the power of the premier to approve the president&#x27;s appointments and the power of the Legislative Council to confirm the president&#x27;s choice of premier was removed (out of fears that the Democratic Progressive Party would one day gain control of the legislature), clearly establishing the president as the more powerful position of the two.

The relationship between the premier and the legislature again became a contentious issue after the 2000 Presidential election, which led to the election of the Democratic Progressive Party&#x27;s Chen Shui-bian to the presidency, while the legislature remained under a Kuomintang-led-Pan-Blue majority. Initially, President Chen Shui-bian appointed Tang Fei, a member of the Kuomintang, to the premiership; however, this arrangement proved unworkable, and Chen&#x27;s subsequent appointments were from the Democratic Progressive Party, leading minority governments. However, the Pan-Blue Coalition of the Kuomintang and its coalition partners contended that Chen&#x27;s actions were unconstitutional, and proposed to name its own choice of premier. When Chen&#x27;s successor Ma Ying-jeou and his KMT party lost a majority in the legislature, Ma had offered for the DPP to nominate a premier, though the DPP refused to do so; thus presidents subsequently appointed premiers largely from their own parties and the established constitutional convention is that the premier is responsible to the president and does not have any responsibility to the legislature other than to report on his activities. There are calls for a constitutional amendment to better define the relationship between the executive and legislative branches of government.

<doc id="277386" wikidata="Q6224071" url="?curid=277386" title="John Busby">
<text>John Busby (24 March 1765 – 10 May 1857) was an English-born surveyor and civil engineer, active in Australia. 

==Early life==
Busby was born in Alnwick, Northumberland, England, eldest son of George Busby, a miner and coalmaster of Stamford, and his wife Margaret, &quot;née&quot; Wilson, of Dunstan, Northumberland. Busby became a coal miner and later a mineral surveyor and civil engineer in Scotland, and was employed on various public work projects, including the provision of a water-supply for Leith fort. Busby received two of the Highland Society&#x27;s awards; firstly for inventing machinery for ascertaining the nature of rock strata by boring, and secondly for developing a method of sinking through quicksands, clay and gravel beds. In 1810 he was employed on the Irish estate of the marquess of Downshire.

He married Sarah Kennedy in 1798 in Scotland. They had six sons and two daughters, all born in Scotland.

==Australia==
Busby and his family emigrated to New South Wales, Australia arriving at Sydney on 24 February 1824. He was engaged as mineral surveyor and civil engineer to the colony at a salary of £200 a year for 200 days in each year.

In June 1825 Busby made an interesting report on the state of the water-supply of Sydney, and suggested that a supply could be drawn from &quot;the large lagoon in the vicinity of the paper mill&quot; to a reservoir in Hyde Park from which it would be distributed throughout the city by pipes. The mill referred to was in the neighbourhood of the present corner of Bourke and Elizabeth Streets, Waterloo. In January 1826 he made a second report, in which he suggested expense could be saved by driving a tunnel into Sydney. This was begun, and in February 1829 Governor Darling stated in a dispatch that it was &quot;quite impossible to dispense with Busby so long as the work in which he is employed introducing water into Sydney is in operation&quot;.

Busby&#x27;s salary had in the meantime been increased to £500 a year, and the colonial office had questioned the necessity of retaining his services any longer and demanded a report on the project in 1832. The water-supply scheme was not completed until September 1837. It had involved the excavation of a tunnel about 12,000 feet (3,660 m) long, but the proposed reservoir at Hyde Park with pipes throughout the city was not gone on with. Busby&#x27;s appointment terminated on the completion of the waterworks, and in August 1838 the payment to him of a sum of £1000 was sanctioned as a gratuity.

Sydney&#x27;s first efficient water supply became known as &quot;Busby&#x27;s Bore&quot;. In this he was assisted by his son, William.

==Late life==
Busby retired to his country property &quot;Kirkton&quot; on the Hunter River which had been granted to him and died there on 10 May 1857. His grave and that of his wife is still preserved as of today at Kirkton (2011).

He was the father of James Busby, who is widely regarded as the &quot;father&quot; of the Australian wine industry.

<doc id="277393" wikidata="Q6454279" url="?curid=277393" title="Kāneʻohe Bay">
<text>Kāneohe Bay, at , is the largest sheltered body of water in the main Hawaiian Islands. This reef-dominated embayment constitutes a significant scenic and recreational feature along the northeast coast of the Island of Oahu. The largest population center on Kāneohe Bay is the town of Kāneohe.


The Bay is approximately long and wide, with a mouth opening of about wide and a maximum depth of in the dredged channel. It has one of the two barrier reefs in the archipelago, the other being the barrier reef of Molokai island, and also has extensive development of shoaling coral reefs within a large lagoon. Two navigable channels cut across the northern and southern ends of the barrier reef. The deeper, northern channel, located off Kualoa Regional Park, provides entrance from the North Pacific Ocean to a ship channel dredged the length of the lagoon between 1939 and 1945. The lagoon contains extensive patch and fringing reefs and its southern end is partly enclosed by the Mokapu Peninsula. This peninsula is occupied by Marine Corps Base Hawaii.
There are five named islands or islets within Kāneohe Bay. A sand bar (Ahu o Laka), Kapapa, and Kekepa (Turtleback Rock) are all islets on the barrier reef. Two islands within Kāneohe Bay are prominent: Mokolii and Moku o Loe (Coconut Island), the largest of the five. Mokolii is a volcanic remnant at the very north end of the Bay, site of former Kualoa Airfield. The community on the northern side is called Waikane, or North Koolaupoko.

Coconut Island is an isolated volcanic remnant located in the southwest part of the bay. Coconut Island is owned by the state of Hawaii and home to the University of Hawaii, and Pauley-Pagen Laboratory (SOEST). Coconut Island was used for the opening sequence of the television program &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.

In August 2010, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot; was filmed on the bay.

Geologically, Kāneohe Bay forms part of a former caldera of the Koolau volcano. In prehistory, most of the volcano cataclysmically slid into the Pacific Ocean, leaving behind only the Range and the Bay.

<doc id="277395" wikidata="Q467378" url="?curid=277395" title="Laura Schlessinger">
<text>Laura Catherine Schlessinger (born January 16, 1947), commonly known as Dr. Laura, is an American talk radio host and author. &quot;The Dr. Laura Program&quot;, heard weekdays for three hours on Sirius XM Radio, consists mainly of her responses to callers&#x27; requests for personal advice and often features her short monologues on social and political topics. Her website says that her show &quot;preaches, teaches, and nags about morals, values, and ethics.&quot; She is an inductee to the National Radio Hall of Fame in Chicago.

Schlessinger used to combine her local radio career in Los Angeles with a private practice as a marriage and family counselor. However, after going into national radio syndication, she concentrated her efforts on &quot;The Dr. Laura Program&quot; heard each weekday, and on writing self-help books. The books &quot;Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives&quot; and &quot;The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands&quot; are among her bestselling works. A short-lived television talk show hosted by Schlessinger was launched in 2000. In August 2010, she announced that she would end her syndicated radio show in December 2010. Her show moved to the Sirius XM Stars satellite radio channel on January 3, 2011. Schlessinger announced a &quot;multiyear&quot; deal to be on satellite radio. On November 5, 2018, her radio program moved to the Sirius XM Triumph Channel 111.

==Early life==
Schlessinger was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. She was raised in Brooklyn and later on Long Island. Her parents were Monroe &quot;Monty&quot; Schlessinger, a Jewish American civil engineer, and Yolanda (née Ceccovini) Schlessinger, a Catholic war bride from Italy. Schlessinger has said her father was charming and her mother beautiful as a young woman. She has a sister, Cindy, who is 11 years her junior. Schlessinger has described her childhood environment as unloving and unpleasant, and her family as dysfunctional. She has ascribed some of the difficulty to extended family rejection of her parents&#x27; mixed faith Jewish-Catholic marriage. Schlessinger said her father was &quot;petty, insensitive, mean, thoughtless, demeaning, and downright unloving&quot;. She described her mother as a person with &quot;pathological pride&quot;, who &quot;was never grateful&quot;, who &quot;would always find something to criticize,&quot; and who &quot;constantly expressed disdain for men, sex, and love&quot;. She credited her father with giving her the drive to succeed.

Schlessinger attended Westbury High School and Jericho High School, where she showed an interest in science. She received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Stony Brook University. Moving to Columbia University for graduate studies, she earned a master&#x27;s and PhD in physiology in 1974. Her doctoral thesis was on insulin&#x27;s effects on laboratory rats. After she began dispensing personal advice on the radio, she obtained training and certification in marriage and family counseling from the University of Southern California, where she worked in the biology department, and a therapist&#x27;s license from the State of California. In addition, she opened up a part-time practice as a marriage and family therapist.

==Radio career==

Schlessinger&#x27;s first appearance on radio was in 1975 when she called in to a KABC show hosted by Bill Ballance. Impressed by her quick wit and sense of humor, Ballance began featuring her in a weekly segment. Schlessinger&#x27;s stint on Ballance&#x27;s show led to her own shows on a series of small radio stations. By 1979, she was on the air Sunday evenings from 9:00 to midnight on KWIZ in Santa Ana, California. That year, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described her show as dealing with all types of emotional problems, &quot;though sex therapy is the show&#x27;s major focus&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Schlessinger was filling in for Barbara De Angelis&#x27; noon-time, relationship-oriented talk show in Los Angeles on KFI, while working weekends at KGIL in San Fernando. Her big break came when Sally Jessy Raphael began working at ABC Radio, and Maurice Tunick, former vice president of talk programming for the ABC Radio Networks, needed a regular substitute for Raphael&#x27;s evening personal-advice show. Tunick chose Schlessinger to fill in for Raphael.

Schlessinger began broadcasting a daily show on KFI, which was nationally syndicated in 1994 by Synergy, a company owned by Schlessinger and her husband. In 1997, Synergy sold its rights to the show to Jacor Communications, Inc., for $71.5 million. Later, Jacor merged with Clear Channel Communications and a company co-owned by Schlessinger, Take on the Day, LLC, acquired the production rights. The show became a joint effort between Take on the Day, which produced it, Talk Radio Network, which syndicated and marketed it to radio stations, and Premiere Radio Networks, (a subsidiary of Clear Channel), which provided satellite facilities and handled advertising sales. As of September 2009, Schlessinger broadcast from her home in Santa Barbara, California, with KFWB as her flagship station. Podcasts and live streams of the show have been available on her website for a monthly fee, and the show was also on XM Satellite Radio.

At its peak, &quot;The Dr. Laura Program&quot; was the second-highest-rated radio show after &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;, and was heard on more than 450 radio stations. Writing in 1998, Leslie Bennett described the popularity of the show:

 In 2010—her last year on terrestrial radio—she was still No. 5.

In May 2002, the show still had an audience of more than 10 million, but had lost several million listeners in the previous two years as it was dropped by WABC and other affiliates, and was moved from day to night in cities such as Seattle and Boston. These losses were attributed in part to Schlessinger&#x27;s shift from giving relationship advice to lecturing on morality and conservative politics. Pressure from gay rights groups caused dozens of sponsors to drop the radio show, as well. In 2006, Schlessinger&#x27;s show was being aired on about 200 stations. As of 2009, it was tied for third place along with &quot;The Glenn Beck Program&quot; and &quot;The Savage Nation&quot;.

Schlessinger used &quot;Hot Talkin&#x27; Big Shot&quot;, a song by country and blues singer and songwriter Nikki Hornsby, for several years as cue music for her radio program and for a national radio commercial advertising for the show. She also used &quot;New Attitude&quot; by Patti LaBelle.

On August 17, 2010, during an appearance on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Schlessinger announced the end of her radio show, saying that her motivation was to &quot;regain her First Amendment rights&quot;, and that she wanted to be able to say what is on her mind without &quot;some special interest group deciding this is a time to silence a voice of dissent.&quot; Several of her affiliates and major sponsors had dropped her show after her on-air use of a racial epithet on August 10 (see  below). Specifically, she said, &quot;[n-word n-word n-word] is what you hear [in rap].&quot;

On January 3, 2011, Schlessinger&#x27;s show moved exclusively to Sirius XM Radio.

She currently offers a short podcast of the &quot;Call of the Day&quot; from her SiriusXM daily show, and it is ranked in the top 25 &quot;Kids and Family&quot; podcasts on iTunes

==Television show==
In 1999, Schlessinger signed a deal with Paramount Domestic Television to produce a syndicated talk show titled &quot;Dr. Laura&quot;, which was carried in major markets by CBS&#x27;s owned and operated stations and in 96% of the nation&#x27;s markets overall for fall 2000. This was viewed as something of a coup by Paramount, as they felt that a popular personality such as Schlessinger could be the spark they needed to sell themselves as a daytime syndication powerhouse rivaling King World and Warner Bros. Television, which distributed the popular topical talk show &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and the variety talk show &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;.

Leading up to the September 11, 2000, premiere of &quot;Dr. Laura&quot;, Schlessinger created a significant amount of controversy. In the months before the premiere of her TV show, Schlessinger called homosexuality a &quot;biological error&quot;, said that homosexuality was acceptable as long as it was not public, and said that homosexuals should adopt older children. She also expressed her view that &quot;a huge portion of the male homosexual populace is predatory on young boys.&quot; Schlessinger was frequently criticized in LGBT media for these views. Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, an LGBT media watchdog group, began monitoring Schlessinger&#x27;s on-air comments about LGBT people, posting transcripts of relevant shows on its website.

In March 2000, a group of gay activists launched StopDrLaura.com, an online campaign with the purpose of convincing Paramount to cancel &quot;Dr. Laura&quot; prior to its premiere. The group protested at Paramount studios, stating her views were offensively bigoted. StopDrLaura.com organized protests in 34 cities in the U.S. and Canada, and picked up on an advertiser boycott of the radio and the TV shows started by another grass-roots organization which called itself &quot;Silence Of The Slams&quot; operating its boycott through AOL Hometown.

On Yom Kippur in 2000, Dr. Laura said she &quot;deeply [regretted] the hurt this situation has caused the gay and lesbian community&quot; and asked for forgiveness, while abstaining from offering a retraction of her words.

&quot;Dr. Laura&quot; premiered to low ratings and unkind reviews. Critics and viewers complained that the format had been dumbed down and did not stand out from any other daytime talk show. The biting rhetoric that worked well on radio seemed overly harsh for face-to-face discourse, owing to the normal sympathetic nature of most other daytime hosts; the radical change in Schlessinger&#x27;s demeanor from her radio persona left viewers cold. The television show failed to generate the energy and interest of Schlessinger&#x27;s radio show.

The credibility of Schlessinger&#x27;s television program also suffered during its first month, when the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Schlessinger had used show staff to falsely pose as guests on the show. A September 25, 2000, episode named &quot;Readin&#x27;, Writin&#x27;, and Cheatin&#x27;&quot; featured a so-called college student who specialized in professional note-taking. On the next day&#x27;s show, &quot;Getting to the Altar,&quot; the same guest appeared in different hair and makeup and said she was a woman living with her boyfriend. In fact, the woman was San-D Duchas, a researcher for the show whose name appeared in the closing credits of the shows on which she posed as a guest.

By November 2000, advertisers that had committed to Schlessinger&#x27;s show had pulled their support due to plummeting ratings. CBS was displeased enough with the ratings that it began looking to either drop the series or move it to late-night slots on its stations within two months of its premiere. Other stations outside of CBS did the same thing, while others moved it to weaker sister stations. &quot;Dr. Laura&quot; aired its last first-run episode on March 30, 2001, on the stations that continued to air it, with reruns continuing until September 2001.

In 2004, Schlessinger said that although the money and celebrity in television is greater, it is not as meaningful or intimate as radio, and for her, television was a &quot;terrible experience&quot;.

==Publications==
===Columns===

For several years, Schlessinger wrote a weekly column syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate that was carried in many newspapers, and in &quot;Jewish World Review&quot;. She discontinued the column in July 2000, citing lack of time due to her upcoming television show. She wrote a monthly column for &quot;WorldNetDaily&quot; between 2002 and 2004, with one entry in 2006. In 2006, Schlessinger joined the &quot;Santa Barbara News-Press&quot;, writing biweekly columns dealing with Santa Barbara news, as well as general news and cultural issues discussed on her radio show. She suspended the column in mid-2007, resumed writing it later, then discontinued it in December 2008. She currently writes columns on her blog, on a variety of topics.

===Books===
Schlessinger has written 14 books for adults and four for children. Several follow the mold of her successful &quot;Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives&quot;, with similarly named books giving advice for men, couples, and parents, while others are more moral in orientation.

===Magazine===
For several years, Schlessinger published a monthly magazine, &quot;Dr. Laura Perspective&quot;. She was the editor, her husband a contributing photographer, and her son the creative consultant. The magazine has ceased publication.

Schlessinger was invited to the editorial board of Skeptic magazine in 1994 after taking a stand against recovered memory therapy, but resigned abruptly in 1998 after it published an issue on &quot;The God Question,&quot; insisting to its publisher Michael Shermer that there can be no question about God&#x27;s existence.

===Website===
Schlessinger has a website that contains hints for stay-at-home parents, her blog, a reading list, and streaming audio of her shows (by subscription only). When it was started, 310,000 people tried to access it simultaneously and it crashed. Certain aspects of feminism are often discussed on her website; she was a self-proclaimed feminist in the 1970s, but is now opposed to feminism.

==Charitable work==
Schlessinger created the Laura Schlessinger Foundation to help abused and neglected children in 1998. Schlessinger regularly asked her on-air audience to donate items for &quot;My Stuff&quot; bags, which go to children in need. All other donations came from other people or groups, usually in the form of donated items for the bags. Per the foundation&#x27;s reports, money not used for operations was directed toward pro-life organizations, such as crisis pregnancy centers. In September 2004, Schlessinger announced that she was closing down the foundation because it had become too difficult and costly for her husband and her to underwrite, and they wished to devote their &quot;energies and resources to other pressing needs&quot;.

In 2007, Schlessinger began fundraising for Operation Family Fund, an organization that aids the families of fallen or seriously injured veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2008, she helped raise more than $1 million for the organization.

In 2017, Dr. Laura began donating proceeds from the sale of jewelry and glass art she designs and hand makes to Children of Fallen Patriots Foundation, a charitable organization that provides college scholarships to military children who lost a parent in the line of duty.

==Awards==
She was the first woman to win the Marconi Award for Network/Syndicated Personality of the Year (1997). In 1998 she received the American Women in Radio &amp; Television&#x27;s Genii Award. She was on the&quot; Forbes&quot; top 100 list of celebrities in 2000 with estimated earnings of $13 million. In September 2002, the industry magazine &quot;Talkers&quot; named Schlessinger as the seventh-greatest radio talk-show host of all time. In 2005 and 2008,

Schlessinger received a National Heritage award from the National Council of Young Israel in March 2001. She also received the National Religious Broadcasters Chairman&#x27;s Award, and has lectured on the national conservative circuit. She was the commencement speaker at Hillsdale College in June 2002, and was awarded an honorary degree as a doctor of tradition and culture.

In 2007, Schlessinger was given an Exceptional Public Service award by the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In 2008,&quot; Talkers&quot; presented her with an award for outstanding community service by a radio talk-show host.

Schlessinger most recently was named to the National Radio Hall of Fame, Class of 2018. Schlessinger and Nanci Donnelan (the Fabulous Sports Babe) are the first two women with their own national radio shows to be inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriage and family life ===
Schlessinger met and married Michael F. Rudolph, a dentist, in 1972 while she was attending Columbia University. The couple had a Unitarian ceremony. Separating from Rudolph, Schlessinger moved to Encino, California in 1975, when she obtained a job in the science department at the University of Southern California. Their divorce was finalized in 1977.

In 1975, while working in the labs at USC, she met Lewis G. Bishop, a professor of neurophysiology, who was married and the father of three children. Bishop separated from his wife and began living with Schlessinger the same year. Schlessinger has vociferously proclaimed her disapproval of unwed couples &quot;shacking up&quot; and having children out of wedlock. According to her friend Shelly Herman, &quot;Laura lived with Lew for about nine years before she was married to him.&quot; His divorce was final in 1979. Bishop and Schlessinger married in 1985. Herman says that Schlessinger told her she was pregnant at the time, which Herman recalls as &quot;particularly joyful because of the happy news.&quot; Schlessinger&#x27;s only child, a son named Deryk, was born in November 1985. Schlessinger&#x27;s husband died November 2, 2015, after being ill for 1.5 years.

In the late 1980s, when her son was almost 4, Schlessinger began training in Hapkido under Sayed Qubadi, and had earned a black belt in that art by 1993.

Schlessinger was estranged from her sister for years, and many thought she was an only child. She had not spoken to her mother for 18 to 20 years before her mother&#x27;s death in 2002 from heart disease. Her mother&#x27;s remains were found in her Beverly Hills condo about two months after she died, and lay unclaimed for some time in the Los Angeles morgue before Schlessinger had them picked up for burial. Concerning the day that she heard about her mother&#x27;s death, she said: &quot;Apparently she had no friends and none of her neighbors were close, so nobody even noticed! How sad.&quot; In 2006, Schlessinger wrote that she had been attacked in a &quot;vulgar, inhumane manner by media types&quot; because of the circumstances surrounding her mother&#x27;s death, and that false allegations had been made that she was unfit to dispense advice based on family values. She said that she had not mourned the deaths of either of her parents because she had no emotional bond to them.

===Religious beliefs===
Born to a Jewish father and an Italian Catholic mother, Schlessinger was raised in Brooklyn in a home that was without religion.
Schlessinger was not religious until she started to practice Conservative Judaism in 1996. In 1998, Schlessinger, Bishop, and their son converted to Orthodox Judaism. and began instruction under Rabbi Reuven P. Bulka of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. During this time, Schlessinger sometimes used Jewish law and examples to advise her callers about their moral dilemmas. She occasionally clarified ethical and moral issues with her local Orthodox Rabbi Moshe D. Bryski, before mentioning them on the air. She was embraced by many in the politically conservative segment of Orthodox Judaism for bringing more awareness of Orthodoxy to her radio show. Some of her expressed views were explicitly religious and are referenced her 1999 book &quot;The Ten Commandments: The Significance of God&#x27;s Laws in Everyday Life&quot;.

In July 2003, Schlessinger announced on her show that she was no longer an Orthodox Jew, but that she was still Jewish.

Over the years, Schlessinger expressed opposition to homosexuality based on biblical scripture, at one point referring to homosexual behavior as &quot;products of a biological disorder&quot;. Her rhetoric eventually prompted an open letter penned in the year 2000 responding to her position that used text of Bible decrees.

===Libel lawsuit===
In 1998, Schlessinger was in a Costa Mesa surf shop with her son when she began perusing the skateboarding magazine &quot;Big Brother&quot;. On her radio program, Schlessinger declared the magazine to be &quot;stealth pornography&quot;. When the owner of the store publicly denied that she found pornography in his store, Schlessinger sued him for lying, claiming that his denial had hurt her reputation. When the case went to court, the judge dismissed her suit, but the shop owner&#x27;s $4 million defamation countersuit lodged for hurting the reputation of his store was allowed to stand. The suit has since been settled, but the terms of the settlement have not been revealed.

===Internet publication of nude photos===
In 1998, Schlessinger&#x27;s early radio mentor, Bill Ballance, sold nude photos of Schlessinger to a company specializing in internet porn. The photos were taken in the mid-1970s, while Schlessinger was involved in a brief affair with the then-married Ballance. Schlessinger sued after the photos were posted on the internet, claiming invasion of privacy and copyright violation. The court ruled that Schlessinger did not own the rights to the photos. She did not appeal the ruling. She told her radio audience that she was embarrassed, but that the photos were taken when she was going through a divorce and had &quot;no moral authority.&quot;

===Use of racial slur===
On August 10, 2010, Nita Hanson, a black woman married to a white man, called Schlessinger&#x27;s show to ask for advice on how to deal with a husband who did not care when she was the subject of racist comments by acquaintances. Schlessinger first replied that &quot;some people are hypersensitive&quot; and asked for some examples from the caller. Hanson informed Schlessinger that her acquaintances had stated, &quot;How you black people do this? You black people like doing that.&quot; Schlessinger responded that her examples were not racist and that &quot;a lot of blacks only voted for Obama simply because he was half black. Didn&#x27;t matter what he was going to do in office; it was a black thing. You gotta know that. That&#x27;s not a surprise.&quot; Schlessinger continued by telling the caller that she had a &quot;chip on [her] shoulder,&quot; was &quot;sensitive,&quot; and also, &quot;Don&#x27;t NAACP me,&quot; and, &quot;a lot of what I hear from black-think ... it&#x27;s really distressing and disturbing.&quot;

When the caller noted that she was referred to as the &quot;n-word&quot; by the individuals in question, Schlessinger complained that blacks are fine with cordially using the slur among themselves, but that it was wrong when whites used it to slur them. In doing so, she uttered &quot;nigger&quot; 11 times, albeit not directed at the caller. She discussed the word and its use by blacks and in black media. When Hanson asked, &quot;Is it ever OK to say that word?&quot; Schlessinger responded, &quot;It depends how it&#x27;s said. Black guys talking to each other seem to think it&#x27;s OK.&quot; After the call Schlessinger said, &quot;If you&#x27;re that hypersensitive about color and don&#x27;t have a sense of humor, don&#x27;t marry out of your race.&quot; Early that evening, she wrote an apology to Los Angeles Radio People online journalist Don Barrett. A day later, as soon as she was back on the air, Schlessinger apologized. Hanson questioned the motivation and sincerity of Schlessinger&#x27;s apology, believing it to be result of being &quot;caught.&quot; Hanson also said that Schlessinger did not apologize for her comments on interracial marriage.

Schlessinger announced in August 2010 that, while not retiring from radio, she would end her radio show at the end of 2010:

In 2011, she began broadcasting on satellite radio with Sirius XM. Her program is also available as a podcast at iTunes and from her own website.

==Fictional portrayals==
In January 1992, Schlessinger played herself in the &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; season four episode &quot;Roberto!&quot;.

In 1999, Schlessinger was parodied as Dr. Nora on the sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;. The character was portrayed as having dogmatic and fundamentalist social views that promoted social conservatism. The character was also shown to have a degree that belies her therapeutic advice and was estranged from her mother.

A fictional, non-speaking depiction of Schlessinger is briefly seen in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; eleventh season episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror X&quot;, as one of the useless people put on a rocketship headed for the Sun.

In 2000, in the episode &quot;The Midterms&quot; on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, the fictional &quot;Dr. Jenna Jacobs&quot; is scolded by President Bartlet, who criticizes her views on homosexuality, and points out she is not a doctor in any field related to morality, ethics, medicine or theology. He quotes from the Bible to point out the inconsistency of condemning certain sins but not others. Show creator Aaron Sorkin admitted to modeling Bartlet&#x27;s diatribe on an anonymous &quot;Letter to Dr. Laura,&quot; which was a popular viral email at the time.

A fictionalised version of Schlessinger is featured as an antagonist in the 2000 animated series &quot;Queer Duck&quot;.

In 2001, Schlessinger was portrayed on the claymation show &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; on the episode, &quot;A Night of Vomit&quot;. She was in a fight with Ellen DeGeneres; she lost.

<doc id="277396" wikidata="Q7431025" url="?curid=277396" title="A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States">
<text>A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that invalidated regulations of the poultry industry according to the nondelegation doctrine and as an invalid use of Congress&#x27; power under the Commerce Clause. This was a unanimous decision that rendered parts of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 (NIRA), a main component of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, unconstitutional. The case from which the ruling stemmed was nicknamed the &quot;Sick Chicken Case&quot;.

==Facts==

The regulations at issue were promulgated under the authority of the NIRA of 1933. These included price and wage fixing, as well as requirements regarding the sale of whole chickens, including unhealthy ones. The government claimed the Schechter brothers sold sick poultry, which has led to the case becoming known as &quot;the sick chicken case&quot;. Also encompassed in the decision were NIRA provisions regarding maximum work hours and a right of unions to organize. The ruling was one of a series which overturned elements of President Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal legislation between January 1935 and January 1936, until the Court&#x27;s intolerance of economic regulations shifted with &quot;West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish&quot;.

The NIRA allowed local codes for trade to be written by private trade and industrial groups. The President could choose to give some codes the force of law. The Supreme Court&#x27;s opposition to an active federal interference in the local economy caused Roosevelt to attempt to pack the Court with judges who were in favor of the New Deal. There were originally 60 charges against Schechter Poultry, which were reduced to 18 charges plus charges of conspiracy by the time the case was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. Among the 18 charges against Schechter Poultry were &quot;the sale to a butcher of an unfit chicken&quot; and the sale of two uninspected chickens. Ten charges were for violating codes requiring &quot;straight killing&quot;. Straight killing prohibited customers from selecting the chickens they wanted; instead a customer had to place his hand in the coop and select the first chicken that came to hand. There was laughter during oral arguments when Justice George Sutherland asked, &quot;Well suppose however that all the chickens have gone over to one end of the coop?&quot;

The Schechter brothers were Jewish; the surname Schechter means &quot;slaughter&quot; in Yiddish, and specifically refers to a ritual slaughterer). According to the trial record, at least some of their customers preferred to select individual chickens, believing that this made it easier to have their rabbi certify the chicken as kosher, though this may not have been a universal belief; the Supreme Court decision did not address any issue of religious liberty.

==Judgment==
Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote for a unanimous Court in invalidating the industrial &quot;codes of fair competition&quot;, which the NIRA enabled the President to issue. The Court held that the codes violated the constitutional separation of powers as an impermissible delegation of legislative power to the executive branch. The Court also held that the NIRA provisions were in excess of congressional power under the Commerce Clause. The Court distinguished between direct effects on interstate commerce, which Congress could lawfully regulate, and indirect effects, which were purely matters of state law. Although the raising and sale of poultry was an interstate industry, the Court found that the &quot;stream of interstate commerce&quot; had stopped in this caseSchechter&#x27;s slaughterhouse&#x27;s chickens were sold exclusively to in-state buyers. Any interstate effect of Schechter was indirect, and therefore beyond federal reach.

Although many considered the NIRA a &quot;dead statute&quot; at this point in the New Deal scheme, the Court used its invalidation as an opportunity to affirm constitutional limits on congressional power, for fear that it could otherwise reach virtually anything that could be said to affect interstate commerce and intrude on many areas of legitimate state power. The court ruled that the law violated the Tenth Amendment. According to Supreme Court historian David P. Currie, the Court believed that &quot;to permit Congress to regulate the wages and hours in a tiny slaughterhouse because of remote effects on interstate commerce would leave nothing for the tenth amendment to reserve&quot;. Currie added that &quot;it can hardly have escaped the Justices that apart from its limitation to business there was little to distinguish what Congress had attempted from the 1933 legislation authorizing Adolf Hitler to govern Germany by decree ... the delegation decision in &quot;Schechter&quot; was a salutary reminder of the Framers&#x27; decision to vest legislative power in a representative assembly.&quot;

Justice Benjamin Cardozo&#x27;s concurring opinion clarified that a spectrum approach to direct and indirect effects is preferable to a strict dichotomy. Cardozo felt that in this case, Schechter was simply too small a player to be relevant to interstate commerce. This traditional reading of the Commerce Clause was later disavowed by the Court, after the &quot;court-packing plan&quot; by President Roosevelt, began to read congressional power more expansively in this area, in cases such as &quot;NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp&quot; (1937). Later cases, such as &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot; (1995), perhaps signal a growing inclination in the Court to once again affirm limits on its scope. In a unanimous 2011 decision, &quot;Bond v. United States&quot;, the Supreme Court cited &quot;Schechter&quot; as a precedent.

==Significance==
Speaking to aides of Roosevelt, Justice Louis Brandeis remarked: &quot;This is the end of this business of centralization, and I want you to go back and tell the president that we&#x27;re not going to let this government centralize everything.&quot; In Hyde Park, New York, a few days after the decision, Roosevelt denounced the decision as an antiquated interpretation of the Commerce Clause. After the decision was announced, newspapers reported that 500 cases of NIRA code violations were going to be dropped.

<text>American Airlines Center (AAC) is a multi-purpose indoor arena located in the Victory Park neighborhood in downtown Dallas, Texas. The arena serves as the home of the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League and Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association. The arena is also used for concerts and other live entertainment. It opened on July 17, 2001, at a cost of $420 million.

==History and construction==
By 1998, the Dallas Mavericks, then owned by H. Ross Perot Jr., and the Dallas Stars were indicating their desire for a new arena to replace the aging and undersized Reunion Arena, which closed in 2008 and was demolished the next year. Dallas taxpayers approved a new hotel tax and rental car tax to pay for a new arena to cover a portion of the funding, with the two benefiting teams, the Mavericks and the Stars, picking up the remaining costs, including cost overruns. The new arena was to be built just north of Woodall Rodgers Freeway near Interstate 35E on the site of an old power plant.

On March 18, 1999, American Airlines (AA) announced that it would be acquiring the naming rights for the arena for $195 million. AA is headquartered in nearby Fort Worth and is based at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. From its opening in 2001 until 2013, the AAC had the then-current AA logo; thereafter the AAC has used the current AA logo.

The first event occurred the next day with an Eagles concert. On the next night, the arena hosted the last show of Michael Flatley&#x27;s Feet of Flames tour. The first sporting event took place on August 19, 2001, with the Dallas Sidekicks of the World Indoor Soccer League taking on the San Diego Sockers.

The AAC includes a practice court for the Mavericks, who used it for regular practices until 2017 when a separate facility was built in the Dallas Design District near the arena.

The Mavericks&#x27; lease on the AAC runs through to 2031.

==Design==

Principal design work was carried out by the Driehaus Prize winner and New Classical architect David M. Schwarz of Washington D.C. American Airlines Center was designed to be the heart of a new urban, commercial area designed to reinvigorate the city of Dallas called Victory Park. The facility itself features a conservative, traditional design with sweeping brick façades and smooth arches. The interior includes retractable seating, public art and a technological arena. Because of the Quonset hut-like appearance of its roof and the fact that American Airlines holds the naming rights some fans have come to refer to it as &quot;The Hangar&quot;.

===PNC Plaza===
On the south side of the arena, PNC Plaza (formerly called Victory Plaza and AT&amp;T Plaza) serves as the principal entrance into the facility. Designed by artist Athena Tacha in 2000, the plaza provides an open space with fountains flanked by retail and office buildings. With several HD video displays from Daktronics mounted on the side of the arena and office buildings, the plaza is often used for outdoor events and movie showings. PNC Plaza is also the site of the Dirk Nowitzki statue, which depicts the former Mavericks player shooting his signature one-legged fadeaway jump shot.

<text>Women composers of Western classical music are disproportionately absent from the music textbooks and concert programs that constitute the patriarchical Western canon, even though many women have composed music.

The reasons for women&#x27;s absence are various. The musicologist Marcia Citron writing in 1990 noted that many works of musical history and anthologies of music had very few, or sometimes no, references to and examples of music written by women. Among the reasons for historical under-representation of women composers Citron has adduced problems of access to musical education and to the male hierarchy of the musical establishment (performers, conductors, impresarios etc.); condescending attitudes of male reviewers, and their association of women composers with &quot;salon music&quot; rather than music of the concert platform; and denial of female creativity in the arts by philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Immanuel Kant. All this needs to be considered in the perspective of restrictions against women&#x27;s advancement in cultural, economic and political spheres over a long historical period.

Such discrimination against women composers can be considered in the context of general societal attitudes about gender or perceived roles of men and women, many musicologists and critics have come to incorporate gender studies in assessing the history and practice of the art.

Some notable Western composers include: Hildegard von Bingen (1098–1179), a German Benedictine abbess, writer, composer, philosopher, Christian mystic, visionary, and polymath; Fanny Mendelssohn (1805–1847); Clara Schumann (1819–1896); Ethel Smyth (1858–1944); Amy Beach (1867–1944); Rebecca Clarke (1886–1979); Germaine Tailleferre (1892–1983); Lili Boulanger (1893–1918); Sofia Gubaidulina (1931–); Kaija Saariaho (1952–2023); and Judith Weir (born 1954 and the first woman to hold the office of Master of the King&#x27;s Music).

<text>Shawn Paul Bradley (born March 22, 1972) is a German-American former professional basketball player who played center for the Philadelphia 76ers, New Jersey Nets, and Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is one of the tallest players in NBA history at . Bradley was born in Landstuhl, West Germany, as his family was stationed at the U.S. military base medical facility, and grew up in Castle Dale, Utah. He holds citizenship in both the United States and Germany.

== Early life ==
Shawn Bradley was born on March 22, 1972, in Landstuhl, West Germany, where his father was working at a U.S. military hospital. Bradley came from a tall family: his father Reiner Bradley (1949–2010) was tall, and his mother Teresa was . Bradley was already by the end of junior high school (age 13–14), and by the end of his junior year of high school (age 16–17) he had grown to , one inch shy of his adult height of . In 2018, genetic analysis of Bradley&#x27;s DNA showed that his great height is not the result of any physical or genetic disorders, but because he happened to inherit a natural but extremely rare combination of the thousands of genetic variants that determine human height.

Bradley was raised on a farm outside the small town of Castle Dale, Utah. He and his siblings were raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Bradley was a standout basketball, football, and baseball player at Emery High School from 1987 to 1990. He was one of the most successful basketball players in Utah high school history, finishing with career averages of 20.3 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 5.4 blocked shots per game. During his time at the school, Emery compiled a 68–4 record and won two state championships. Bradley was named All-State three times and twice earned the season MVP award. In his senior year, he averaged 25 points, 17 rebounds, and 9 blocks per contest. He was named All-American by several national publications, including &quot;Parade Magazine&quot;, &quot;Street and Smith&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, and others. He turned in a strong performance at the McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game (12 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 blocks), earning the Most Valuable Player award for the West team. As of 2015, Bradley still holds Utah state records for blocked shots in a single game (18), season (209), and career (605).

== College career and LDS mission ==
Bradley was heavily recruited by many colleges from across the United States, but ultimately decided to play at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. During his freshman season (1990–91), he started all 34 games for BYU, averaging 14.8 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. But his main contribution to the team was shot-blocking: he led the entire nation in total blocks (177) and average (5.2 per game)—setting an NCAA freshman record in both categories.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA.com/Stats&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In one game against Eastern Kentucky (EKU), Bradley blocked 14 shots, tying the NCAA single-game record set by Navy&#x27;s David Robinson in 1986. In that same game, Bradley also established a new career high by scoring 29 points.

BYU received a bid to the NCAA tournament that season, and Bradley continued his dominant defense. In the first-round game against Virginia, he set a tournament single-game record with 10 blocked shots, leading the Cougars to a 61–48 victory. However, he struggled with foul trouble in the second round, and BYU lost to Arizona, 76–61. Bradley collected several awards and honors for his outstanding freshman season. He was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Freshman of the Year, in addition to All-WAC defensive team and newcomer team honors. He was also named Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press (AP)

Bradley took a two-year leave of absence from BYU from 1991 to 1993 to serve as a full-time missionary for the LDS Church. He was assigned to serve in Sydney, Australia. After his mission, Bradley decided to forgo his final three years of NCAA eligibility and declared for the NBA draft.

== Professional career ==

=== Philadelphia 76ers (1993–1995) ===
Bradley entered the 1993 NBA draft as one of the most intriguing and highly debated prospects in the history of the NBA draft. Supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league. Critics argued that he would struggle in the NBA due to his thin build – listed at just , he was described by Ric Bucher of The Miami Herald as &quot;rail-thin,&quot; and Lee Rose, player personnel director for the Milwaukee Bucks at the time, said, &quot;Size-wise, he&#x27;ll get pushed around a little bit,&quot; – and lack of experience (just one season of college basketball, followed by a two-year hiatus from the sport due to his church mission). Ultimately, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the second overall pick, behind Chris Webber and ahead of Penny Hardaway. Given the novelty of a 7-foot-6 center playing for the 76ers, Bradley was issued jersey number 76.

Philadelphia&#x27;s management saw Bradley as a major project with huge long-term potential. The team acquired legendary big man Moses Malone to serve as a mentor for Bradley, hoping to develop his skills in the low post. Also, the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant Pat Croce and registered dietitian Jeanie Subach, as well as assistant coach Jeff Ruland, to add bulk to Bradley&#x27;s skinny frame. His rookie season (1993–94) produced mixed results. In his first game, Bradley totaled just 6 points and 5 rebounds, but he did manage to block 8 shots in 25 minutes.

For much of his career, Bradley was inconsistent in scoring and rebounding, but he always excelled at blocking shots. He averaged 10.3 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game in his first season – good enough to earn NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. He shot 40.9 percent from the floor and constantly struggled with turnovers and foul trouble. He suffered a season-ending injury in February of that year, dislocating his kneecap in a collision with Portland&#x27;s Harvey Grant.

Bradley returned to full strength in his second season, playing in all 82 games for the 76ers. His scoring actually declined slightly (9.5 points per game), but his rebounding and shot-blocking increased. He racked up 274 rejections, setting a franchise record for most blocks in a single season. Bradley gave Philly fans a glimpse of his potential in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers in November, posting career highs of 28 points and 22 rebounds in a 97–83 victory. He also tied a career high with 9 blocked shots, and was credited with 9 additional &quot;intimidations&quot; as the Clippers were held to their lowest-ever point total against the 76ers. He finished the season in strong fashion, posting 13 double-doubles in his last 17 games.

=== New Jersey Nets (1995–1997) ===
Despite these highlights, Bradley continued to baffle and frustrate Philadelphia with his inconsistent play. Just 12 games into his third season (1995–96), the 76ers traded Bradley to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mureșan, leading the Nets to a 99–81 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mureşan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.

Bradley lifted his game to new levels in March 1996. He posted a career-high 32 points and added 15 rebounds against Dallas early in the month, and set another career high a week later with 10 blocked shots against the Phoenix Suns. He recorded his first career triple-double in the very next game, tallying 19 points, 17 rebounds, and a career-best 11 blocked shots in another match-up against Mureşan and the Bullets. In April, Bradley posted back-to-back triple-doubles (against Boston and Toronto); in the process, he became the first player in NBA history to record consecutive games of double-figure blocked shots twice in a single season. His season averages for 1995–96 were 11.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.7 blocks per game—all career highs.

The Nets began the 1996–97 season under new management: John Calipari was named head coach in the off-season, and John Nash replaced Willis Reed as general manager. Reed had been a big believer in Bradley, but Calipari and Nash weren&#x27;t nearly as excited about the 7-foot-6 enigma. In an effort to save some cash against the salary cap, the Nets traded their big center (and his big contract) to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster mid-season deal that involved nine players.

=== Dallas Mavericks (1997–2005) ===

Bradley embraced yet another &quot;fresh start&quot; with a new franchise. With increased playing time in Dallas, Bradley posted some of the best numbers of his career. In a game against the Clippers, he tied his career high by scoring 32 points—the most ever by a center in the history of the Mavericks franchise. He also added a season-high 16 rebounds in that same contest. He finished the year with averages of 13.2 points and 8.4 rebounds per game—breaking career highs set during the previous season. But most importantly, Bradley provided strong defense in the paint that Dallas had been lacking before his arrival. In fact, Bradley finished the year as the top shot-blocker in the entire league, averaging 3.4 swats per contest. It was the first time any Mavericks player had ever led the NBA in any statistical category.

And yet, Bradley continued to be plagued by the maddening inconsistency that defined his entire professional career. During the 1997–98 season, Dallas coach Jim Cleamons experimented by bringing Bradley off the bench in several games (instead of his usual role as starter). In one particular game, it paid off in a major way: Bradley totaled 22 points, 22 rebounds, and a career-high 13 blocked shots in an April contest against the Trail Blazers. Bradley became the fifth NBA player to record at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 blocks in a single game, and the first to do so off the bench. The previous players to record a 20–20–10 game with points, rebounds, and blocks were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. Bradley finished the year with a team-record 214 blocked shots; his average of 3.3 per game ranked third in the NBA.

Bradley played 7 more seasons in the league, remaining with the Mavericks until his retirement in 2005. Over that span, his playing time slowly declined, mainly due to some injuries and constant juggling of the team&#x27;s lineups and rotations by coach Don Nelson. In particular, Bradley&#x27;s offensive role became very limited, but he remained an imposing defensive presence. In fact, in the 2000–01 season, he broke his own team record by blocking 228 shots for Dallas—the highest total in the NBA that year. The Mavericks emerged as a perennial playoff contender, mostly due to the rise of star players such as Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash, but Bradley&#x27;s defense made a significant contribution. He finished his career with averages of 8.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in 23.5 minutes of action per game.

== National team career ==
Bradley has competed internationally for Germany; he and Dallas teammate Dirk Nowitzki were members of the German national basketball team that finished in fourth place at the EuroBasket 2001 in Turkey. In order to participate in this tournament, Bradley made use of his birth by a German mother to obtain German citizenship.

== Post-basketball career ==
After his retirement as a player, Bradley became involved with West Ridge Academy, a coeducational private school for at-risk youths in West Jordan, Utah. Bradley&#x27;s role with the school involves some of the functions of a vice principal, counselor, and coach. Describing Bradley, school executive director Ken Allen said, &quot;Shawn has a great presence—due to his size—and has immediate credibility with the kids. His instant credibility when he&#x27;s talking to kids makes him an incredible mentor. He is a great example of someone who has worked hard and been very successful. Being so tall wasn&#x27;t always easy for him. He knows about being the &#x27;odd kid&#x27; and dealing with that.&quot;

On March 19, 2010, Bradley filed papers to run as a Republican against incumbent Democratic Representative Tim Cosgrove for the 44th District seat in the Utah House of Representatives. On November 2, 2010, Bradley lost the election to Cosgrove, earning 46.49% of the vote against Cosgrove&#x27;s 51.13%.

== Personal life ==
Bradley has participated in many charitable endeavors. In the 2000–01 season he donated $25 for each blocked shot to Bryan&#x27;s House, a managed facility for children affected by HIV and AIDS. He is a national spokesman for the Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Hospitals. Bradley has also participated in the &quot;Basketball Without Borders&quot; program with other NBA players like Dikembe Mutombo, DeSagana Diop and Malik Rose and found his experiences with children in Africa uplifting. He has also participated in treating leprosy colonies in India through the Rising Star Outreach.

While in the NBA, Bradley was fined for refusing to attend a mandatory meeting at a strip club, due to his religious beliefs.

Bradley and his first wife had six children together but he is largely estranged from them. In 2017, Bradley married Carrie Cannon, adopting her three children in 2019.

On January 20, 2021, Bradley was struck from behind by a motorist while riding his bicycle near his home in St. George, Utah, which resulted in a traumatic spinal cord injury in his neck that left him paralyzed. Bradley was in the process of passing a car parked on the shoulder of the road when he drifted in front of a minivan who bumped him from behind; the driver of that vehicle was not charged with a crime.

In a 2022 interview with &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Bradley stated that he and his family intend to move into a more wheelchair-friendly home in Dallas, Texas, while he continues his rehabilitation. Bradley described his height as a &quot;hindrance&quot; to his recovery, as quadriplegia at his height has no medical precedent.

== TV and movie appearances ==
Bradley had a role in the film &quot;Space Jam&quot; in 1996, depicted as one of the NBA stars who lose their talent alongside Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing. He also appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;, and had a cameo appearance as an auto mechanic in &quot;The Singles Ward&quot; movie. In 2011, he appeared in a music video tribute to Jimmer Fredette, along with former BYU football star Chad Lewis and legendary coach LaVell Edwards. He has also appeared in an episode of &quot;Studio C&quot;.

Bradley was featured in the ESPN 30 for 30 short documentary &quot;Posterized&quot; given his propensity &quot;for being on the wrong end of a lot of great dunks.&quot;

<text>The was the hereditary peerage of the Empire of Japan, which existed between 1869 and 1947. It was formed by merging the feudal lords (&quot;daimyō&quot;) and court nobles (&quot;kuge&quot;) into one system modelled after the British peerage. Distinguished military officers, politicians, and scholars were occasionally ennobled until the country&#x27;s defeat in the Second World War in 1945 (新華族, &quot;shin kazoku&quot;, lit. &quot;the newly ennobled&quot;). The system was abolished with the 1947 constitution, which prohibited any form of aristocracy under it, but &quot;kazoku&quot; descendants still form the core of the traditional upper class in the country&#x27;s society, distinct from the nouveau riche.

Kazoku () should not be confused with &quot;kazoku ()&quot;, which is pronounced the same in Japanese, but written with different characters, meaning &quot;immediate family&quot; (as in the film &quot;Kazoku&quot; above).

== Origins ==

Following the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the ancient court nobility of Kyoto, the , regained some of its lost status. Several members of the , such as Iwakura Tomomi and Nakayama Tadayasu, played a crucial role in the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate, and the early Meiji government nominated to head all seven of the newly established administrative departments.

The Meiji oligarchs, as part of their Westernizing reforms, merged the with the former into an expanded aristocratic class on 25 July 1869, to recognize that the and former were a social class distinct from the other designated social classes of and . They lost their territorial privileges. Itō Hirobumi, one of the principal authors of the Meiji constitution, intended the new peerage to serve as a political and social bulwark for the &quot;restored&quot; emperor and the Japanese imperial institution. At the time, the (142 families) and former (285 families) consisted of a group of total 427 families.

All members of the without an official government appointment in the provinces were initially obliged to reside in Tokyo. By the end of 1869, a pension system was adopted, which gradually displaced the from their posts as provincial governors and as government leaders. The stipends promised by the government were eventually replaced by government bonds.

== Development ==

In 1884 the were reorganized and the old feudal titles were replaced with:
# 
# 

There were several categories within the . The initial rank distribution for houses of descent depended on the highest possible office to which its ancestors had been entitled in the imperial court. Thus, the heirs of the of the Fujiwara dynasty (Konoe, Takatsukasa, Kujō, Ichijō and Nijō) all became princes, the equivalent of a European duke, upon the establishment of the in 1884. 

The heads of eight other families (Daigo, Hirohata, Kikutei, Koga, Saionji, Tokudaiji, Ōinomikado and Kasannoin) all with the rank of seiga, the second rank in the , became marquesses at the same time. Those family heads in the third tier of the and with the rank of daijin became counts. Heads of families in the lowest three tiers (those in the ranks of urin, mei and han) typically became viscounts, but could also be ennobled as counts.

Other appointments to the two highest ranks in the —prince and marquess—from among the were also made to reward certain families for their roles in the Meiji Restoration, for taking a prominent role in national affairs or for their close degree of relationship to the Imperial family. Thus the head of the -ranked house became a prince in 1884. The heads of the Tokudaiji and the Saionji houses were advanced to the rank of prince from the rank of marquess in 1911 and 1920, respectively. 

In recognition of his father&#x27;s role in the Meiji Restoration, Iwakura Tomosada, the heir of noble Iwakura Tomomi and whose family had been in the fourth tier of nobility, with the rank of , was ennobled as a prince in 1884. Nakayama Tadayasu, the Meiji Emperor&#x27;s maternal grandfather and also from an -ranked family, was ennobled as a marquess. The head of the Shō family, the former royal family of the Ryūkyū Kingdom (Okinawa), was given the title of marquess. When the Korean Empire was annexed in 1910, the House of Yi was mediatized as an incorporated and therefore . Some Korean princes were also made Japanese princes (公).

Excluding the Tokugawas, the initial rank distribution for the former lords depended on rice revenue: those with 150,000 or more became marquesses, those with 50,000 or more become counts, and those with holdings rated below 50,000 became viscounts. The head of the Tokugawa clan, Tokugawa Iesato, became a prince, the heads of primary Tokugawa branch houses () became marquesses, the heads of the secondary branches became counts and the heads of more distant branches became viscounts. The head of the Matsudaira (Fukui Domain) branch was raised to the rank of marquess from the rank of count in 1888. In 1902, the former Tokugawa Yoshinobu was created a prince, and the head of the Mito house was raised to the same rank, prince, in 1929.

Of the other former clans, the heads of the Mōri (Chōshū Domain) and Shimazu (Satsuma Domain) clans were both ennobled as princes in 1884 for their role in the Meiji Restoration; the Yamauchi (Tosa Domain) clan was given the rank of marquess. The heads of the main Asano (Hiroshima Domain), Ikeda (Okayama and Tottori Domains), Kuroda (Fukuoka Domain), Satake (Kubota Domain), Nabeshima (Saga Domain), Hachisuka (Tokushima Domain), Hosokawa (Kumamoto Domain) and Maeda (Kaga Domain) clans became marquesses in 1884. 

Notably, the head of the main family line of the Date clan, which had formerly ruled the extensive Sendai Domain, was only ennobled as a count and was thus denied a hereditary seat in the House of Peers; this was likely due to the domain&#x27;s prominent role as the leader of a coalition against the Imperial forces during the Boshin War. In 1891, the head of the Date-Uwajima family (Uwajima Domain), a cadet branch of the clan which had remained loyal to the Emperor during the conflict, was raised to the rank of marquess, having been ennobled as a count in 1884.

Many of those who had significant roles in the Meiji Restoration, or their heirs, were ennobled. Ito Hirobumi and Yamagata Aritomo were ennobled as counts in 1884, promoted to marquesses in 1895 and finally became princes in 1907. The heirs of Okubo Toshimichi and Kido Takayoshi, two of the three great nobles of the Meiji Restoration, were ennobled as marquesses in 1884, followed by the heirs of samurai general-politician Saigō Takamori in 1902.

==Succession and numbers==

As in the British peerage, only the actual holder of a title and his consort were considered members of the . The holders of the top two ranks, prince and marquess, automatically became members of the House of Peers in the Diet of Japan upon their succession or upon majority (in the case of peers who were minors). Counts, viscounts and barons elected up to 150 representatives from their ranks to sit in the House of Peers.

Under the Peerage Act of 7 July 1884, pushed through by Home Minister and future first Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi after visiting Europe, the Meiji government expanded the hereditary peerage with the award of status to persons regarded as having performed distinguished public services to the nation. The government also divided the into five ranks explicitly based on the British peerage, but with titles deriving from the ancient Chinese nobility.

Usually, though not always, titles and hereditary financial stipends passed according to primogeniture. Unlike in European peerage systems, but following traditional Japanese custom, illegitimate sons could succeed to titles and estates. To prevent their lineages from dying out, heads of houses could (and frequently did) adopt sons from collateral branches of their own houses, whether in the male or female lines of descent, and from other houses whether related or not. 

Unlike European custom, the adopted heir of a peer could succeed to a title ahead of a more senior heir in terms of primogeniture. A 1904 amendment to the 1889 Imperial Household Law allowed minor princes () of the imperial family to renounce their imperial status and become peers (in their own right) or heirs to childless peers.
Initially there were 11 non-imperial princes, 24 marquesses, 76 counts, 324 viscounts and 74 barons, for a total of 509 peers. By 1928, through promotions and new creations, there were a total of 954 peers: 18 non-imperial princes, 40 marquesses, 108 counts, 379 viscounts and 409 barons. The reached a peak of 1016 families in 1944.

The 1947 Constitution of Japan abolished the and ended the use of all titles of nobility or rank outside the immediate Imperial Family. Since the end of the war, many descendants of the families continue to occupy prominent roles in Japanese society and industry.

The , or Peers&#x27; Club, was the association of the high nobility. It had its headquarters in the building. After 1947 it was renamed the and is located in the Kasumigaseki Building in Kasumigaseki.

== Life ==
Although &quot;kazoku&quot; families were supposed to live in a style that matched their status, living standards varied significantly from family to family. &quot;Kuge&quot; families, long having been seen as a spent force since the samurai class became the de facto ruling class in the 11th century, tended to be significantly worse off than &quot;daimyo&quot; families. The &quot;Nara kazoku&quot; (奈良華族), consisting of 26 monk families from Kofukuji, who descended from kuge families (22 of which belonged to the Fujiwara clan), were all made barons under the &quot;kazoku&quot; system. They were regarded as the poorest and received extra stipends to support their living. A 1915 survey found that a kazoku family had around 13 servants on average, while the grandest families had hundreds. 

Almost all kazoku heirs raised in Japan attended Gakushuin for their primary and secondary education. For higher education, the most preferred institutions included the University of Tokyo (called Tokyo Imperial University 1897-1947) (e.g., Prince Iemasa Tokugawa, Count Yoriyasu Arima) and the naval and army academies (e.g., Viscount Naganari Ogasawara, Marquess Toshinari Maeda). Some opted to be educated overseas, such as at Eton College (e.g., Prince Iesato Tokugawa) and Cambridge University (e.g., Marquess Masauji Hachisuka, Baron Koayata Iwasaki). After completing their education, they pursued varied careers such as statesmen at the House of Peers, diplomats (e.g., Prince Iemasa Tokugawa, Marquess Naohiro Nabeshima), and scholars (e.g., Marquess Yoshichika Tokugawa, Prince Tomohide Iwakura). Those who followed rather unusual career paths included Marquess Hijikata Yoshi, who became a communist and fled to Soviet Russia, and Meiho Ogasawara, an heir to a viscountcy who pursued his passion for films and was disinherited in 1935.

&quot;Kazoku&quot; usually married within their class. The Imperial Household Law of 1889 prohibited Imperial Princes from marrying commoners, hence their options were limited to Princesses and daughters of &quot;kazoku&quot; families. &quot;Kazoku&quot; daughters who married into the Imperial family include Kikuko, Princess Takamatsu (née Tokugawa), Yuriko, Princess Mikasa (née Takagi), and Setsuko, Princess Chichibu (née Matsudaira).

<text>James Busby (7 February 1802 – 15 July 1871) was the British Resident in New Zealand from 1833 to 1840. He was involved in drafting the 1835 Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand and the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. As British Resident, he acted as New Zealand&#x27;s first jurist and the &quot;originator of law in Aotearoa&quot;, to whom New Zealand &quot;owes almost all of its underlying jurisprudence&quot;. Busby is regarded as the father of the Australian wine industry, as he brought the first collection of vine stock from Spain and France to Australia.

==Life==
He was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, the son of English engineer John Busby and mother Sarah Kennedy. His parents and he emigrated from Britain to Sydney, New South Wales, in 1824.

Busby received a Grant of Land from the Governor of New South Wales and after much careful deliberation chose a block of 2,000 acres in the Coal River area of the Hunter Valley, where he began growing grapes. At the same time, he took employment at the Male Orphans School at Bald Hills near Liverpool where he was in charge of the farm and taught viticulture. When the trustees of the Church and School Corporation took over control of the school in 1827, Busby lost the job. He was then appointed collector of internal revenue temporarily, until 1829. The government made him a new job offer but he was not happy with it nor with the terms of his severance from the orphan school, and returned to England in 1831 to petition the Colonial Office. He also visited Spain and France to further his study in viticulture. He wrote a number of reports that he presented to the Colonial Office and one on the state of New Zealand earned him appointment as British Resident in New Zealand in March 1832. Busby returned to Sydney on 16 October 1832.

===In New Zealand===
Busby married Agnes Dow at Segenhoe, in the Hunter Region, on 1 November 1832. He left for New Zealand on HMS &quot;Imogene&quot; in April 1833 and arrived in the Bay of Islands on 5 May. Agnes followed him, arriving in July. A house (which still stands) was completed for him at Waitangi, where he planted some of the vine stock he had collected in Europe, from which vineyard wine was being made before his vines were productive in Australia. His duties were to protect British commerce, control, and to mediate between the unruly European settlers and Māori in New Zealand. However, he was not provided with any resources to impose this authority.

After an unregistered New Zealand ship was seized in Australia, Busby proposed that New Zealand should have a national flag. A selection of three or four designs was sent from Australia, and Māori chiefs chose one at a meeting at his residency on 20 March 1834; see United Tribes of New Zealand.

====Independence and Treaty of Waitangi====
In 1835 Busby learned that Baron Charles de Thierry, a Frenchman, was proposing to declare French sovereignty over New Zealand. He drafted the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand and at a meeting in October signed it together with 35 chiefs from the northern part of New Zealand.

After the arrival of William Hobson in 1840, Busby co-authored with him the Treaty of Waitangi. It was first signed on 5 and 6 February 1840 on the lawn outside his residence. Busby and his family left Waitangi that year. He declined an offer for a position in the new colonial government, and instead focused on farming interests, but became entangled in litigation over his own land titles: the New Zealand Banking Company seized his Waitangi property without giving Busby&#x27;s debtors an opportunity to pay what they owed, and Governor Grey expropriated Busby&#x27;s land at Whangārei. He also edited a newspaper and in 1853 was elected a member of the Auckland Provincial Council. As a member of the provincial council, he became an outspoken supporter of establishing Auckland as a separate colony to the rest of New Zealand. Popular opinion at the time went against Busby, and some newspapers claimed his arguments for Auckland&#x27;s separation were due to his inability to settle land claims with the colonial government.

He contested the 1860 general election for a seat in the House of Representatives for the Bay of Islands electorate, but was unsuccessful.

===Later life===
He died in 1871 in Anerley, England, after travelling back for an eye operation, and is buried at West Norwood Cemetery in London. His wife returned to New Zealand where she died, at Pakaraka, in 1889, and is buried at Paihia. James and Agnes had six children. Daughter Sarah married John William Williams, son of missionary Henry Williams.

The Waitangi property, on which the Treaty was signed, was derelict until the 1930s, when it was purchased by the Governor-General of the day, Viscount Bledisloe and donated to the nation.

<doc id="277409" wikidata="Q7893237" url="?curid=277409" title="United States v. Butler">
<text>United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1 (1936), is a U.S. Supreme Court case that held that the U.S. Congress has not only the power to lay taxes to the level necessary to carry out its other powers enumerated in Article I of the U.S. Constitution, but also a broad authority to tax and spend for the &quot;general welfare&quot; of the United States. The decision itself concerned whether the processing taxes instituted by the 1933 Agricultural Adjustment Act were constitutional.

==Tax for impermissible regulatory purpose==

The main issue of the case was whether certain provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 conflicted with the U.S. Constitution. The Act imposed a tax on processors of farm products, the proceeds of which to be paid to farmers who would reduce their area under cultivation and consequently their crops yields. The Act was intended to increase the prices of certain farm products by decreasing the supply of quantities produced. This increased the cotton price paid for Hoosac Mills in North Adams, Massachusetts who brought the case.

The Court held that the so-called tax was not a true tax since the payments to farmers were coupled with unlawful and oppressively-coercive contracts, and the proceeds were earmarked for the benefit of farmers complying with the prescribed conditions. The Court also held that making the payment of a government subsidy to a farmer conditional on the reduction of the planned crops went beyond the powers of the national government.

Specifically, Justice Roberts said:
The act invades the reserved rights of the states. It is a statutory plan to regulate and control agricultural production, a matter beyond the powers delegated to the federal government. The tax, the appropriation of the funds raised, and the direction for their disbursement, are but parts of the plan. They are but means to an unconstitutional end.

==Taxing and spending for general welfare==
The Court struck down the Act but dealt positively with taxation and the expenditure of funds to advance the general welfare as specified in Article 1, Section 8, of the Constitution. The Court stated that the issue &quot;presents the great and the controlling question in the case.&quot; After comparing expansive and restrictive interpretations of the Spending Clause, the Court adopted this philosophy:
The clause confers a power separate and distinct from those later enumerated[,] is not restricted in meaning by the grant of them, and Congress consequently has a substantive power to tax and to appropriate, limited only by the requirement that it shall be exercised to provide for the general welfare of the United States... It results that the power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public moneys for public purposes is not limited by the direct grants of legislative power found in the Constitution.

The fact that the Court struck down the Act despite an expansive interpretation of the Spending Clause reflected the turmoil in the Court at the critical time. It was accepted that Chief Justice Hughes did not agree with the majority opinion&#x27;s argument that the law&#x27;s government subsidy regulations went beyond the powers of national government and was about to write a separate opinion to uphold the Act&#x27;s subsidy provision and to strike down the Act&#x27;s tax provision on the grounds that it was a coercive regulation, rather than a tax measure, until Roberts convinced Hughes that he would side with him and the court&#x27;s three liberal justices in future cases on agriculture that involved the Constitution&#x27;s General Welfare Clause if he agreed to join his opinion.

An indication that turmoil and the fact that &quot;Butler&quot; was a turning point in the Court&#x27;s thinking is that in later jurisprudence, the case has been referenced to support expansion of authority under the Spending Clause (such as &quot;Steward Machine Company v. Davis&quot;, , and &quot;Helvering v. Davis&quot; ) and to dissent from such expansion (such as in &quot;South Dakota v. Dole&quot;, ). In her dissent to &quot;Dole&quot;, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor noted that &quot;Butler&quot; had been the last case in which the Supreme Court struck down an Act of Congress as an over-extension of its spending power. That was part of a series of cases decided by the conservative Supreme Court of the time, which struck down as unconstitutional parts of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal legislation.

<doc id="277416" wikidata="Q1409441" url="?curid=277416" title="Prince Johnson">
<text>Prince Yormie Johnson (6 July 1952 – 28 November 2024) was a Liberian warlord and politician, who served as a senator for Nimba County from 2006 to 2024. Once a rebel leader, Johnson played a prominent role in the First Liberian Civil War.

After previously serving as an officer in the Armed Forces of Liberia, Johnson allied himself with Charles Taylor&#x27;s National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) rebel group when it launched the First Liberian Civil War in 1989 to overthrow President Samuel Doe. Due to a rift with Taylor, Johnson soon formed an NPFL splinter group, the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL), which captured, tortured and executed Doe in 1990. Following continued clashes with Taylor and the pro-Doe ULIMO group, the INPFL was disbanded and Johnson was forced into exile in Nigeria in 1992, where he converted to Christianity and reconciled with the Doe family.

Johnson returned to Liberia in 2004 following the end of the Second Liberian Civil War and was elected to the Senate of Liberia in the 2005 Liberian general election. He founded a political party, the National Union for Democratic Progress (NUDP) in 2010, before being expelled from it in 2014. 
He then founded a new party, Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction (MDR) in 2016. He was thereafter re-elected to the Senate in 2014 and 2023. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for President in 2011 and 2017, respectively finishing in third and fourth place in the first round.

==Early life ==
Johnson was born in Tapeta, Nimba County, in the east-central interior of the country, and was brought up by an uncle in the capital city of Monrovia. In 1971, while living in Monrovia, he joined the Liberian National Guard (LNG), which was transformed into the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) in the aftermath of Samuel Doe&#x27;s 1980 overthrow of President William R. Tolbert.

He rose to the rank of Lieutenant, receiving military training in both Liberia and the United States, where he was instructed in military police duties in South Carolina. A stern, often draconian, disciplinarian, he served as aide-de-camp to Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa, the Commanding General of the Armed Forces of Liberia, and accompanied him into exile in 1983, after Quiwonkpa was accused of plotting a coup against Doe.

== Liberia&#x27;s civil war and warlordship ==
Johnson later allied with Charles Taylor as part of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), serving as the NPFL&#x27;s Chief Training Officer. Taylor&#x27;s fighters crossed the border from Ivory Coast and began operations in Liberia on Christmas Eve, 1989.

=== Formation of the INPFL ===
An internal power struggle resulted in Johnson breaking off from the Taylor-led NPFL and forming the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL). Despite intervention in the civil war by the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), INPFL forces captured most of Monrovia in the late summer of 1990.

During the civil war, Johnson was notorious for killing anyone who opposed or criticised his actions. When Hare Krishna devotees, who were distributing food to starving people in Monrovia in the midst of the chaos of the civil war, sent him a letter begging him to stop killing people, he personally orchestrated the murder of Hladini devi dasi—born Linda Jury—and five of her students on the bank of the Saint Paul River on the night of Thursday, 13 September 1990.

=== Killing of President Doe ===
On 9 September 1990, Johnson&#x27;s supporters abducted President Samuel Doe from ECOMOG headquarters in the Monrovia port district. Doe was tortured and executed in Johnson&#x27;s custody on 9 September, with the spectacle videotaped and broadcast around the world. The video showed Johnson sipping a Budweiser beer and being fanned by an assistant as his men cut off Doe&#x27;s ear.

Johnson later denied killing Doe.

=== Claim to power ===
After Doe&#x27;s death Johnson briefly claimed the presidency of Liberia. Johnson&#x27;s claim to power ended following the consolidation of rebel power under Charles Taylor. In an attempt by the weak national government to reconstruct Liberian politics, the INPFL was recognised at a conference held in Guinea, where Amos Sawyer was elected president.

=== Flight to Nigeria ===
Johnson was forced to flee to Nigeria to avoid capture by rebel forces supporting Taylor and was not involved in the Second Liberian Civil War. He lived in Nigeria for 12 years.

While in Nigeria, Johnson became a Christian and reconciled with the Doe family through the intervention of Nigerian pastor T. B. Joshua.

== Return and public office ==
Johnson returned to Liberia in March 2004, following the resignation of Taylor as president and the installation of a transitional government. He stated his intention to return to politics, though he briefly left Liberia again on 7 April due to death threats he had received from the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) rebel group. In the 2005 general elections, Johnson contested and won a Senate seat representing Nimba County. For a period he served as the chair of the Senate&#x27;s defence committee.

In 2008, Johnson stated that he and Charles Taylor had been solicited to assassinate Thomas Sankara, naming Blaise Compaoré as the instigator, with the surety of Félix Houphouët-Boigny. The investigation conducted since 2015 to clarify the circumstances of this assassination, however, seems to rule out this hypothesis, although doubts persist.

In the June 2009 final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was established as part of the 2003 peace deal, the TRC recommended Johnson&#x27;s inclusion on a list of 50 people who should be &quot;specifically barred from holding public offices; elected or appointed for a period of thirty (30) years&quot; for &quot;being associated with former warring factions.&quot; Johnson labelled the recommendation a &quot;joke,&quot; noting the absence of several other combatants from the list, and vowed to resist any charges brought as a result of the report.

In January 2011, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Williams v. Tah&quot;, a case brought by another person recommended for disqualification in the TRC report, that the TRC&#x27;s recommendation was an unconstitutional violation of the listed individuals&#x27; right to procedural due process, and that it would be unconstitutional for the government to implement the proposed bans.

Johnson ran in Liberia&#x27;s 2011 presidential election as the candidate of the newly formed National Union for Democratic Progress party. He placed third, with 11.6% of the vote; the election was won by the country&#x27;s previous president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

Ahead of the 2014 Senate election, Johnson was expelled from the NUDP. Johnson won re-election to the Senate as an independent. 

By 2017, Johnson formed a new party, the Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction (MDR). Johnson contested the presidency with the party in the 2017 election. Johnson supported Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) candidate George Weah in the subsequent run-off election. Weah was ultimately elected president. 

On 9 December 2021, Johnson was sanctioned by the United States Department of Treasury for alleged political corruption, claiming he would sell votes in elections for financial gains.

Towards the ending of 2022, Johnson withdrew his support for President Weah and the CDC. Johnson cited the lack of Nimba County representation in top appointed positions. In December 2022, Johnson resigned as head of the MDR. In an MDR convention on 22 December, Senator Jeremiah Koung was elected standard bearer. As standard bearer, Koung continued Johnson&#x27;s policy of opposing the CDC.

In the 2023 Senate election, Johnson was re-elected with the MDR.

== Death ==
Johnson died in a hospital in Paynesville, Montserrado on 28 November 2024, at the age of 72. He was granted a five-day state funeral and was buried at the PYJ Polytechnic University named after him in Ganta, Nimba County on 18 January 2025. Current Liberian President Joseph Boakai and former Liberian President George Weah attended his funeral.

<text>Aero Virgin Islands was an airline based in St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands.

==History==

Aero Virgin Islands Corp. began operating in the Caribbean during the late 1970s. Operations specifications issued by the Federal Aviation Administration under the Federal Aviation Regulations, part 121 issued on March 2, 1977, specialized in inter-island flights to and from St. Thomas Harry S Truman Airport, Alexander Hamilton Airport on Saint Croix and Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The names of some of these airports have been changed over the years. 
The airline had scheduled flights to the three above Islands, plus charter flights to many points in the Caribbean. The airline used DC-3-202 airplanes in the early years for their flights. Around 1984, they began using the DC-3 A, B and C&#x27;s (C-47). The aircraft, DC-3 A, B and C&#x27;s were leased out of Puerto Rico and were formally Air BVI&#x27;s fleet of aircraft.

Aero Virgin Islands&#x27; main competitor was the Puerto Rico based airline, Prinair, until 1984, when Prinair went bankrupt. Aero Virgin Islands was the major mover of passengers for the next few years. However, by middle 1989, most of the fleet was nonoperational with no engines on the aircraft. In September 1989, with only two DC-3 operating, Aero Virgin Islands suffered a setback when N28346 was destroyed in St. Thomas Cyril E. King Airport by Hurricane Hugo. Only the N5117X DC-3 (C-47) was able to be repaired of the damage it suffered during the hurricane and returned to service; it had been put in the hangar at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport. The rest of the fleet outside on the ramp in San Juan Int&#x27;l Airport were totally destroyed by Hurricane Hugo.

In 1986, Aero Virgin Islands Corp. recruited four pilots with DC-3 experience to fly for the airline while they tried unsuccessfully to upgrade their FAA part 135 certificate back to a part 121 certificate and place a Martin 404 on the certificate. The four pilots would be used to offset other pilots who were to be pulled off the line to train on the 404, which they did get. Mr. Peter Pess and Mr. James Beekman were unsuccessful in transitioning Aero Virgin Islands back to be the flag carrier of the Caribbean. Mr. Pess was supposed to supply engines for the DC-3s.
Increased competition from such airlines as LIAT, and American Eagle forced Aero Virgin Islands out of operations by 1990.

==Key people==

Joseph A. Cranston is listed as general manager in the manual issued on March 21, 1978. Mark K. Odiorne was also one of founders, and he has since died. Mark was listed as vice president of maintenance. James H. Masters was director of operations in one the memos dated March 1980. He was born on the island of St. Croix and grew up on that island. For a short period of time during 1982–1983, Melvin R. Mann (formerly with Peat Marwick Mitchell CPAs in Miami) served as financial VP. Reuben B. Wheatley was the president of Aero Virgin Islands Corp. from the beginning to the end of the airline.

==Fleet==
*Douglas DC-3

==Accidents and incidents==
*On January 2, 1978, Douglas DC-3 N15598 ditched in the sea off San Juan. The aircraft was on an international scheduled passenger flight from Saint Thomas Airport, United States Virgin Islands to San Juan. All five people on board survived. The cause of the accident was pilot mismanagement of the fuel system, running the starboard tanks dry when there was fuel available in the port tanks.

*On September 17, 1989, Douglas DC-3 N4425N, Douglas C-47s N100SD, N4471J and N4577Z, were damaged beyond economic repair by Hurricane Hugo at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan Puerto Rico. Douglas C-49J N28346 was damaged beyond economic repair at Cyril E. King Airport, Charlotte Amalie, United States Virgin Islands by Hurricane Hugo.

<doc id="277440" wikidata="Q864947" url="?curid=277440" title="Hundred Schools of Thought">
<text>The Hundred Schools of Thought () were philosophies and schools that flourished during the late Spring and Autumn period and Warring States period (221 BC). The term was not used to describe these different philosophies until Confucianism, Mohism, and Legalism were created. The era in which they flourished was one of turbulence in China, fraught with chaos and mass militarization, but where Chinese philosophy was developed and patronized by competing bureaucracies. This phenomenon has been called the Contention of a Hundred Schools of Thought.

The philosophies that emerged during this period have profoundly influenced East Asian culture and societies. The intellectual landscape of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars, who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the way of government, war, and diplomacy. Often, members and traditions of the same school had little in common other than the same influential figure that their beliefs were based on. This period ended with the rise of the imperial Qin dynasty and the subsequent burning of books and burying of scholars as part of an ideological suppression effort by Qin Shi Huang and Li Si.

==In the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;==

A traditional source for this period is the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; by Sima Qian. Its autobiographical section describes several schools of thought.

===Confucianism===

Confucianism is arguably the most enduring body of thought on Chinese life. Its written legacy lies in the Confucian classics, which later became the foundation of traditional society. Confucius (551–479 BC) looked back to the earlier days of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties for an ideal sociopolitical order.

He believed that the only effective system of government necessitated prescribed relationships for each individual: &quot;Let the ruler be a ruler and the subject a subject.&quot; He contended that a king must be virtuous in order to rule the state properly. To Confucius, the functions of government and social stratification were facts of life to be sustained by ethical values. His ideal human was the &quot;junzi&quot;, which is translated as &#x27;gentleman&#x27; or &#x27;superior person&#x27;.

Mencius (371–289 BC) formulated his teachings directly in response to Confucius. The effect of the combined work of Confucius, the codifier and interpreter of a system of relationships based on ethical behavior, and Mencius, the synthesizer and developer of applied Confucianist thought, was to provide traditional Chinese society with a comprehensive framework by which to order virtually every aspect of life.

There were many accretions to the body of Confucian thought, both immediately and over the millennia, from within and without the Confucian school. Interpretations adapted to contemporary society allowed for flexibility within Confucianism, while the fundamental system of modeled behavior from ancient texts formed its philosophical core.

Diametrically opposed to Mencius, in regards to human nature, was the interpretation of Xunzi (237 BC), another Confucian follower. Xunzi preached that man is not innately good; he asserted that goodness is attainable only through training one&#x27;s desires and conduct.

===Legalism===

Legalist doctrine was formulated by Li Kui, Shang Yang (), Han Fei (), and Li Si (), who maintained that human nature was incorrigibly selfish; accordingly, the only way to preserve the social order was to impose discipline from above, and to see to a strict enforcement of laws. The Legalists exalted the state above all, seeking its prosperity and martial prowess over the welfare of the common people.

Legalism greatly influenced the philosophical basis for the imperial form of government. During the Han dynasty, the most practical elements of Confucianism and Legalism were taken to form a sort of synthesis, marking the creation of a new form of government that would remain largely intact until the late 19th century, with continuing influence into the present.

===Taoism===

Taoism developed into the second most significant stream of Chinese thought. Its formulation is often attributed to the legendary sage Laozi. The focus of Taoism is on the individual within the natural realm, rather than the individual within society. Accordingly, the goal of life for each individual is seeking to adjust oneself and adapting to the rhythm of nature (and the Fundamental) world, to follow the Way (Tao) of the universe, and to live in harmony.

In many ways the opposite of Confucian morality, Taoism was for many of its adherents a complement to their ordered daily lives. A scholar serving as an official could usually follow Confucian teachings, but in retirement might seek harmony with nature as a Taoist recluse. Politically, Taoism advocates for rule through inaction, and avoiding excessive interference.

===Mohism===

Mohism was developed by followers of Mozi (). Though the school did not survive through the Qin dynasty, Mohism was seen as a major rival of Confucianism in the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought. Its philosophy rested on the idea of : Mozi believed that &quot;everyone is equal before heaven&quot;, and that people should seek to imitate heaven by engaging in the practice of collective love.

This is often translated and as &#x27;universal love&#x27;, which is misleading as Mozi believed that the essential problem of human ethics was an excess of partiality in compassion, not a deficit in compassion as such. His aim was to re-evaluate behavior, not emotions or attitudes. His epistemology can be regarded as primitive materialist empiricism. He believed that human cognition ought to be based on one&#x27;s perceptionsone&#x27;s sensory experiences, such as sight and hearinginstead of imagination or internal logic, elements founded on the human capacity for abstraction.

Mozi advocated frugality, condemning the Confucian emphasis on ritual and music, which he denounced as extravagant. He regarded offensive warfare as wasteful and advocated pacifism or at the most, defensive fortification. The achievement of social goals, according to Mozi, necessitated the unity of thought and action. His political philosophy bears a resemblance to divine-rule monarchy: the population ought always to obey its leaders, as its leaders ought always to follow the will of heaven.

Mohism might be argued to have elements of meritocracy: Mozi contended that rulers should appoint officials by virtue of their ability instead of their family connections. Although popular faith in Mohism had declined by the end of the Qin dynasty, its views are said to be strongly echoed in Legalist thought.

===School of Naturalists===

The School of Naturalists was a philosophy that synthesized the concepts of yin and yang and the Five Elements; Zou Yan is considered the founder of this school. His theory attempted to explain the universe in terms of basic forces in nature: the complementary agents of yin (dark, cold, wet, passive, contracting, negative) and yang (light, hot, dry, active, expanding, positive) and the Five Elements or Five Phases (water, fire, wood, metal, and earth).

In its early days, this theory was most strongly associated with the states of Yan and Qi. In later periods, these epistemological theories came to hold significance in both philosophy and popular belief. This school was absorbed into Taoism&#x27;s alchemic and magical dimensions as well as into the Chinese medical framework. The earliest surviving recordings of this are in the Mawangdui Silk Texts and &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot;.

===School of Names===

The School of Names grew out of Mohism, and focused on definitions and logic. It is said to have parallels with that of the Ancient Greek sophists or dialecticians. Its most notable member was Gongsun Long.

==In the &quot;Book of Han&quot;==
In addition to the above six major philosophical schools within the Hundred Schools of Thought, the &quot;Yiwenzhi&quot; of the &quot;Book of Han&quot; adds four more into the Ten Schools (十家; &quot;Shijia&quot;).

===School of Diplomacy===
===Agriculturalism===

Agriculturalism was an early agrarian social and political philosophy that advocated peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. The philosophy is founded on the notion that human society originates with the development of agriculture, and societies are based upon &quot;people&#x27;s natural propensity to farm.&quot;

The Agriculturalists believed that the ideal government, modeled after the semi-mythical governance of Shennong, is led by a benevolent king, one who works alongside the people in tilling the fields. The Agriculturalist king is not paid by the government through its treasuries; his livelihood is derived from the profits he earns working in the fields, not his leadership.

Unlike the Confucians, the Agriculturalists did not believe in the division of labour, arguing instead that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon an egalitarian self sufficiency. The Agriculturalists supported price fixing, in which all similar goods, regardless of differences in quality and demand, are set at exactly the same, unchanging price. For example, Mencius once criticized its chief proponent Xu Xing for advocating that rulers should work in the fields with their subjects. One of Xu&#x27;s students is quoted as having criticized the duke of Teng in a conversation with Mencius by saying:

===Syncretism===

Syncretism integrated teachings from different schools; for instance, Lü Buwei found scholars from different schools to write a book called &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot; cooperatively. This school tried to integrate the merits of various schools and avoid their perceived flaws. The &quot;Shizi&quot; () is the earliest textual example of the Syncretic School.

==Unlisted schools==

These schools were not listed in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, but had substantial influence.

===School of the Military===
The School of the Military () that often studied and discussed what westerners called the philosophy of war. Some of them studied warfare and strategy, others focused on kinds and skills of weapons. Sun Tzu and Sun Bin were influential leaders. Some of their famous works are &quot;The Art of War&quot; and Sun Bin&#x27;s &quot;Art of War&quot;.

&quot;The Art of War&quot; ascribes supernatural elements to good generalship, such as the intertwining of the four seasons with &quot;Tian&quot;, which is also yin and yang.

Their theories later influenced China and East Asia more broadly. These classical texts have received great interest among contemporary interpreters, some of whom have applied it to military strategy, the martial arts, and modern business.

===Yangism===
Yangism was a form of ethical egoism founded by Yang Zhu. It was once widespread but fell to obscurity before the Han dynasty. Due to its stress on individualism, it influenced later generations of Taoists.

===School of the Medical Skills===
The School of the Medical Skills () is a school which studied medicine and health. Bian Que and Qibo were well-known scholars. Two of the earliest and existing Chinese medical works are the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; and the Han-era &quot;Shanghan Lun&quot;.

===Five Agents School===
The Five Agents School was another predecessor to the School of Naturalists (or the School of Yin-yang), which incorporated its ideas.

&quot;The Five Agents schooled viewed five primal elements as active cosmic agents engaged in interaction and change.&quot; These five elements were the &quot;wuxing&quot;, a force that &quot;integrated life and the universe.&quot;
