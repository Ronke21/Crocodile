<text>Revolution Software Limited is a British video game developer based in York, founded in 1989 by Charles Cecil, Tony Warriner, David Sykes and Noirin Carmody. Its most popular line of games is that of &quot;Broken Sword&quot;, a series which began in 1996 with &quot;Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars&quot;. As of 2024, there have been a further four iterations in the series: &quot;The Smoking Mirror&quot; (1997), &quot;The Sleeping Dragon&quot; (2003), &quot;The Angel of Death&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Curse&quot; (2013).

==Company history==
===1992–1994: &quot;Lure of the Temptress&quot; and &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky&quot;===
The company&#x27;s logo was inspired by the 1981 film &quot;Excalibur&quot; and designed in collaboration with a graphic design firm in Hull.

Released in 1992 for the Amiga, Atari ST and DOS platforms, &quot;Lure of the Temptress&quot; was both critically and commercially a success which helped set the company up for their future game releases. Revolution released the game as freeware on 1 April 2003.

Their next game was released in 1994; &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky&quot; became a hit on the Amiga and IBM PC compatibles. The game focused on protagonist Robert Foster&#x27;s abduction and subsequent search for answers in a dystopian city of the future. In that period they also ported Sierra&#x27;s &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow&quot; to the Amiga. Virtual Theatre system was used instead of Sierra&#x27;s Creative Interpreter because of its much better performance.

===1996–1997: &quot;Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars&quot; and &quot;Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror&quot;===
Despite the success of &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky&quot;, it was the company&#x27;s next game that they would become best known for, and which would have both the biggest critical and commercial success. &quot;Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars&quot; was released for PC and PlayStation in 1996 and was later ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2002. The game revolves around the story of George Stobbart, an American tourist whose holiday in Paris is rudely interrupted by a bombing. Investigating, he runs into photo-journalist Nicole Collard, and the two embark on a globe-trotting adventure. The hand drawn graphics, story and characters, and gameplay helped cement the company&#x27;s reputation for story driven games. The game was quickly followed by a well-received sequel, &quot;Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror&quot;. According to Charles Cecil, each of the first two &quot;Broken Sword&quot; games sold around 1,000,000 copies in the mid-1990s.

===2000: &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; and &quot;Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado&quot;===
In July 2000, the company released their first 3D game &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; for the PlayStation (later released for Microsoft Windows in October 2000). Set in the near future, the game featured John Cord, an MI6 agent. Sent to the fictional, former Soviet region of Volgia, the player embarks on a mission to investigate a newly discovered substance, Blue Nephrine. However, Cord is betrayed and must work out by whom, while simultaneously trying to work out what plans the dictator of Volgia, General Nagarov, has for this mysterious new chemical and the implications for the world.

In December 2000, the company also released a children&#x27;s adventure game &quot;Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado&quot; to coincide with the release of the film &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot;.

===2001–2002: &quot;Good Cop Bad Cop&quot; cancellation===
The company then started work on &quot;Good Cop Bad Cop&quot;, an action game for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube. However the game was eventually cancelled so that the company could concentrate on &quot;Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon&quot;.

===2003–2006: &quot;Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon&quot; and &quot;Broken Sword: The Angel of Death&quot;===
Released in November 2003, &quot;Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon&quot; featured 3D graphics, and moved away from the 2D point-and-click style of older games. As the game was developed for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and Xbox simultaneously, they decided to implement a direct control mechanism for the protagonist, instead of mouse control clicking on hot spots, as this was easier to convert to console game pads.

Revolution released &quot;Broken Sword: The Angel of Death&quot; on 15 September 2006. At the start of the game, George is working as a bail bonds clerk when he falls in love with Anna-Maria, a woman who asks George to help her find an artifact.

===2009–2011: Director&#x27;s Cut and Remasters===
On 1 March 2009, Revolution Software released a director&#x27;s cut version of their first &quot;Broken Sword&quot; series, titled &quot;Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars – Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, for Wii and Nintendo DS platforms (later on iOS, Microsoft Windows and OS X). According to a Charles Cecil interview with Pocket Gamer, the iOS version of the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; sold around 160,000 copies by December 2010. The company also announced that &quot;The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; is coming soon to Android.

In October 2009, &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky – Remastered&quot; was made available on the Apple App Store. &quot;The Remastered Edition&quot; sold around 20,000 copies in its first month and expected to hit 70,000 sales in the first year and 100,000 lifetime sales.

The company announced the remastered edition of the second game in the &quot;Broken Sword&quot; series on 9 December 2010, called &quot;Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror – Remastered&quot;. The game was released in late 2010 on iPhone, April 2011 on OS X and May 2011 on Microsoft Windows.

===2012–present: &quot;Broken Sword 5: The Serpent&#x27;s Curse&quot;, &quot;Beyond a Steel Sky&quot; and &quot;Broken Sword 6&quot; ideas===
On 25 July 2012, Charles Cecil posted on his personal Facebook account: &quot;Totally focused on the announce video for our next game. I am thrilled by how it&#x27;s looking, and can&#x27;t wait to talk publicly, but completing the video for end of the month – as originally promised – now seems somewhat ambitious.&quot; After a short delay, the game was officially announced to be a fifth entry in the series: &quot;Broken Sword 5: The Serpent&#x27;s Curse&quot;. The game was announced with a Kickstarter campaign and a video, showing some of the game&#x27;s graphics and hinting at its storyline.

After the release of &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky – Remastered&quot;, Charles Cecil and Dave Gibbons stated that a sequel could be likely and that iPhone would be the ideal platform. During the &quot;Broken Sword 5&quot; crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, the company originally put &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky 2&quot; as a $1,000,000 bonus stretch goal if the new Broken Sword game raises enough money, but it only raised $820,000 (including PayPal donations). On 24 September 2012, after failing to reach the bonus stretch goal, the company&#x27;s co-founder Tony Warriner said that &quot;after the huge success of the &quot;Broken Sword 5&quot; crowdfunding campaign on Kickstater, it inspired us to begin work on &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky 2&quot;. Development of the sequel will begin after the release of &quot;Broken Sword 5&quot;. We&#x27;re delighted by the recent level of interest in a sequel to &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky&quot; and are currently discussing design ideas for this project which we plan to go into development following the release of &quot;Broken Sword 5&quot;. We&#x27;re deeply touched that our &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky&quot; fans are as enthusiastic today as they were when the original game released in 1994.&quot; &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky 2&quot; is to be developed for iOS, Android, PC, Linux and OS X. There is also a possibility in looking into a console version release.
In a September 2015 interview, Cecil announced that he was working on a story for &quot;Broken Sword 6&quot; which would involve the main characters travelling to Germany. In a later interview from April 2020, however, Cecil said he was &quot;mulling around&quot; ideas for &quot;Broken Sword 6&quot;, while his focus seemed to be still on &quot;Beyond a Steel Sky&quot;, though he did not exclude the idea that the next &quot;Broken Sword&quot; game may follow the company&#x27;s present project.

Towards the end of 2023, Revolution announced that a sixth instalment of &quot;Broken Sword&quot; was in development, titled &quot;Broken Sword: Parzival&#x27;s Stone&quot;, which is scheduled for release in 2024. In addition, a &quot;Reforged&quot; revamp of the first game, &quot;Shadow of the Templars&quot;, was due for release in 2024, with updated graphics and other minor changes to the original gameplay.

<doc id="290515" wikidata="Q13582" url="?curid=290515" title="Berlin Conference">
<text>The Berlin Conference of the 1884–1885s was a meeting of colonial powers that concluded with the signing of the General Act of Berlin, an agreement regulating European colonisation and trade in Africa during the New Imperialism period. The conference of fourteen countries was organised by Otto von Bismarck, the first chancellor of Germany, at the request of Leopold II of Belgium. It met on 15 November 1884 and, after an adjournment, concluded on 26 February 1885 with the signing of the General Act.

The General Act of Berlin can be seen as the formalisation of the Scramble for Africa that was already in full swing. The conference contributed to ushering in a period of heightened colonial activity by European powers, and is sometimes cited as being responsible for the &quot;carve-up of Africa&quot;. However, some scholars warn against overstating its role in the colonial partitioning of Africa, drawing attention to the many bilateral agreements concluded before and after the conference. A 2024 study found that the only borders set at the conference were those of the Congo region (and these were subsequently revised), and that most of Africa’s borders did not take their final form until over two decades later. Wm. Roger Louis conceded, however, that &quot;the Berlin Act did have a relevance to the course of the partition&quot; of Africa.

Seven of the fourteen countries represented – Austria-Hungary, Russia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden-Norway, the Ottoman Empire, and the United States – came home without any formal possessions in Africa.

==Background==
Prior to the conference, European diplomats approached African rulers and the French leaders had already invaded some parts of Lagos in the same manner as they had in the Western Hemisphere, by establishing a connection to local trade networks. In the early 1800s, the European demand for ivory, which was then often used in the production of luxury goods, led many European merchants into the interior markets of Africa. European spheres of power and influence were limited to coastal Africa at this time as Europeans had only established trading posts (protected by gunboats) up to this point.

In 1876, King Leopold II of Belgium, who had founded and controlled the International African Association the same year, invited Henry Morton Stanley to join him in researching and &quot;civilising&quot; the continent. In 1878, the International Congo Society was also formed, with more economic goals but still closely related to the former society. Leopold secretly bought off the foreign investors in the Congo Society, which was turned to imperialistic goals, with the &quot;African Society&quot; serving primarily as a philanthropic front.

From 1878 to 1885, Stanley returned to the Congo not as a reporter but as Leopold&#x27;s agent, with the secret mission to organise what would become known as the Congo Free State soon after the closure of the Berlin Conference in August 1885. French agents discovered Leopold&#x27;s plans, and in response France sent its own explorers to Africa. In 1881, French naval officer Pierre de Brazza was dispatched to central Africa, travelled into the western Congo basin, and raised the French flag over the newly founded Brazzaville in what is now the Republic of Congo. Finally, Portugal, which had essentially abandoned a colonial empire in the area, long held through the mostly defunct proxy Kingdom of Kongo, also claimed the area, based on old treaties with Restoration-era Spain and the Catholic Church. It quickly made a treaty on 26 February 1884 with its old ally, Great Britain, to block off the Congo Society&#x27;s access to the Atlantic.

By the early 1880s, a lot of the factors including diplomatic successes, greater European local knowledge, and the demand for resources such as gold, timber, and rubber, triggered dramatically increased European involvement in the continent of Africa. Stanley&#x27;s charting of the Congo River Basin (1874–1877) removed the last from European maps of the continent, delineating the areas of British, Portuguese, French and Belgian control. These European nations raced to annex territory that might be claimed by rivals.

France moved to take over Tunisia, one of the last of the Barbary states, using a claim of another piracy incident. French claims by Pierre de Brazza were quickly acted on by the French military, which took control of what is now the Republic of the Congo in 1881 and Guinea in 1884. Italy became part of the Triple Alliance, an event that upset Bismarck&#x27;s carefully laid plans and led Germany to join the European invasion of Africa.

In 1882, realizing the geopolitical extent of Portuguese control on the coasts, but seeing penetration by France eastward across Central Africa toward Ethiopia, the Nile, and the Suez Canal, Britain saw its vital trade route through Egypt to India threatened. Because of the collapsed Egyptian financing and a subsequent mutiny in which hundreds of British subjects were murdered or injured, Britain intervened in the nominally Ottoman Khedivate of Egypt, which it controlled for decades.

==Conference==
The European race for colonies made Germany start launching expeditions of its own, which frightened both British and French statesmen. Hoping to quickly soothe the brewing conflict, Belgian King Leopold II convinced France and Germany that common trade in Africa was in the best interests of all three countries. Under support from the British and the initiative of Portugal, Otto von Bismarck, the Chancellor of Germany, called on representatives of 13 nations in Europe as well as the United States to take part in the Berlin Conference in 1884 to work out a joint policy on the African continent.

The conference opened on 15 November 1884 and closed on 26 February 1885. The number of plenipotentiaries varied per nation, but these 14 countries sent representatives to attend the Berlin Conference and sign the subsequent Berlin Act:

Uniquely, the United States reserved the right to decline or to accept the conclusions of the conference.

==General Act==
The General Act fixed the following points:
* Partly to gain public acceptance, the conference resolved to end slavery by African and Islamic powers. Thus, an international prohibition of the slave trade throughout their respected spheres was signed by the European members. In his novella &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, Joseph Conrad sarcastically referred to one of the participants at the conference, the International Association of the Congo (also called &quot;International Congo Society&quot;), as &quot;the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs&quot;. The first name of this Society had been the &quot;International Association for the Exploration and Civilization of Central Africa&quot;.
* The properties occupied by Belgian King Leopold&#x27;s International Congo Society, the name used in the General Act, were confirmed as the Society&#x27;s. On 1 August 1885, a few months after the closure of the Berlin Conference, Leopold&#x27;s Vice-Administrator General in the Congo, Francis de Winton, announced that the territory was henceforth called &quot;the Congo Free State&quot;, a name that in fact was not in use at the time of the conference and does not appear in the General Act. The Belgian official &quot;Law Gazette&quot; later stated that from that same 1 August 1885 onwards, Leopold II was to be considered Sovereign of the new state, again an issue never discussed, let alone decided, at the Berlin Conference. 
* The 14 signatory powers would have free trade throughout the Congo Basin as well as Lake Malawi and east of it in an area south of 5° N.
* The Niger and Congo rivers were made free for ship traffic.
* The Principle of Effective Occupation (based on effective occupation, see below) was introduced to prevent powers from setting up colonies in name only.
* Any fresh act of taking possession of any portion of the African coast would have to be notified by the power taking possession, or assuming a protectorate, to the other signatory powers.
* Definition of regions in which each European power had an exclusive right to pursue the legal ownership of land

The first reference in an international act to the obligations attaching to spheres of influence is contained in the Berlin Act.

===Principle of effective occupation===

The principle of effective occupation stated that a power could acquire rights over colonial lands only if it possessed them or had effective occupation: if it had treaties with local leaders, flew its flag there, and established an administration in the territory to govern it with a police force to keep order. The colonial power could also make use of the colony economically. That principle became important not only as a basis for the European powers to acquire territorial sovereignty in Africa but also for delimiting their respective overseas possessions, as effective occupation served in some instances as a criterion for settling colonial boundary disputes. However, as the scope of the Berlin Act was limited to the lands that fronted on the African coast, European powers in numerous instances later claimed rights over interior lands without demonstrating the requirement of effective occupation, as articulated in Article 35 of the Final Act.
At the Berlin Conference, the scope of the Principle of Effective Occupation was heavily contested between Germany and France. The Germans, who were new to the continent, essentially believed that as far as the extension of power in Africa was concerned, no colonial power should have any legal right to a territory unless the state exercised strong and effective political control and, if so, only for a limited period of time, essentially an occupational force only. However, Britain&#x27;s view was that Germany was a latecomer to the continent and was assumptively unlikely to gain any possessions beyond those it already held, which were swiftly proving to be more valuable than British territories. That logic caused it to be generally assumed by Britain and France that Germany had an interest in embarrassing the other European powers on the continent and forcing them to give up their possessions if they could not muster a strong political presence. On the other side, Britain had large territorial holdings there and wanted to keep them while it minimised its responsibilities and administrative costs. In the end, the British view prevailed.

The great powers&#x27; disinclination to rule their territories is apparent throughout the protocols of the Berlin Conference but especially in the Principle of Effective Occupation. In line with Germany and Britain&#x27;s opposing views, the powers finally agreed that it could be established by a European power establishing some kind of base on the coast from which it was free to expand into the interior. The Europeans did not believe that the rules of occupation demanded European hegemony on the ground. The Belgians originally wanted to include that effective occupation required provisions that &quot;cause peace to be administered&quot;, but Britain and France were the powers that had that amendment struck out of the final document.

That principle, along with others that were written at the conference, allowed the Europeans to conquer Africa but to do as little as possible to administer or control it. The principle did not apply so much to the hinterlands of Africa at the time of the conference. This gave rise to hinterland theory, which basically gave any colonial power with coastal territory the right to claim political influence over an indefinite amount of inland territory. Since Africa was irregularly shaped, that theory caused problems and was later rejected.

==Agenda==
* Portugal–Britain: The Portuguese government presented a project, known as the &quot;Pink Map&quot;, or the &quot;Rose-Coloured Map&quot;, in which the colonies of Angola and Mozambique were united by co-option of the intervening territory (the land later became Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Malawi). All of the countries attending the conference, except for Britain, endorsed Portugal&#x27;s ambitions, and just over five years later, in 1890, the British government issued an ultimatum that demanded the Portuguese withdraw from the disputed area.
* France–Britain: A line running from Say in Niger to Maroua, on the northeastern coast of Lake Chad, determined which part belonged to whom. France would own territory to the north of the line, and Britain would own territory to the south of it. The basin of the Nile would be British, with the French taking the basin of Lake Chad. Furthermore, between the 11th and 15th degrees north in latitude, the border would pass between Ouaddaï, which would be French, and Darfur in Sudan, which would be British. In reality, a no man&#x27;s land 200 km wide was put in place between the 21st and 23rd meridians east.
* France–Germany: The area to the north of a line, formed by the intersection of the 14th meridian east and Miltou, was designated to be French, and the area to the south would be German, later called German Cameroon.
* Britain–Germany: The separation came in the form of a line passing through Yola, on the Benue, Dekoa, going up to the extremity of Lake Chad.
* France–Italy: Italy was to own what lies north of a line from the intersection of the Tropic of Cancer and the 17th meridian east to the intersection of the 15th parallel north and the 21st meridian east.

==Aftermath==
The conference provided an opportunity to channel latent European hostilities towards one another outward; provide new areas for assisting the European powers expand in the face of rising American, Russian and Japanese interests; and form constructive dialogue to limit future hostilities. In Africa, colonialism was introduced across nearly all the continent. When African independence was regained after World War II, it was in the form of fragmented states.

The Scramble for Africa sped up after the Conference since even within areas designated as their sphere of influence, the European powers had to take effective possession by the principle of effectivity. In central Africa in particular, expeditions were dispatched to coerce traditional rulers into signing treaties, using force if necessary, such as was the case for Msiri, King of Katanga, in 1891. Bedouin- and Berber-ruled states in the Sahara and the Sahel were overrun by the French in several wars by the beginning of World War I. The British moved up from South Africa and down from Egypt and conquered states such as the Mahdist State and the Sultanate of Zanzibar and, having already defeated the Zulu Kingdom in South Africa in 1879, moved on to annex the independent Boer republics of Transvaal and the Orange Free State.

Within a few years, Africa was at least nominally divided up south of the Sahara. By 1895, the only independent states were:

By 1902, 90% of all the land that makes up Africa was under European control. Most of the Sahara was French, but after the quelling of the Mahdi rebellion, the end of the Fashoda crisis and the Voulet–Chanoine Mission, the Sudan remained firmly under joint British–Egyptian rulership, with Egypt being under British occupation before becoming a British protectorate in 1914.

The Boer republics were conquered by the British in the Second Boer War from 1899 to 1902. Libya was conquered by Italy in 1911, and Morocco was divided between the French and Spanish in 1912.

===Motives and David Livingstone&#x27;s crusade===
One of the chief stated justifications &quot;was a desire to stamp out slavery once and for all&quot;. Before he died in 1873, Christian missionary, David Livingstone, called for a &quot;worldwide&quot; crusade to defeat the Arab-controlled slave trade in East Africa. The way to do it was to &quot;liberate Africa&quot; by the introduction of &quot;commerce, Christianity&quot; and civilisation.

Crowe, Craven, and Katzenellenbogen are authors who have attempted to soften the language and therefore the intent of the conference. They warn against an overemphasis on its role in the colonial partitioning of Africa, extensively justifying it by ignoring the motivations and outcomes of the conference by only drawing attention to bilateral agreements concluded before and after the conference, regardless of whether they were finalised and followed in practice. For example, Craven has questioned the legal and economic impact of the conference. 

However, the countries that ultimately participated in the Final Act ignored requirements set forth within it to establish their satellite governments, rights to the land, and trade for the benefit of their national, and domestic economies.

==Analysis by historians==
Historians have long marked the Berlin Conference as the formalisation of the Scramble for Africa but recently, scholars have questioned the legal and economic impact of the conference.

Some have argued the conference central to imperialism. African-American historian W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in 1948 that alongside the Atlantic slave trade in Africans a great world movement of modern times is &quot;the partitioning of Africa after the Franco-Prussian War which, with the Berlin Conference of 1884, brought colonial imperialism to flower&quot; and that &quot;[t]he primary reality of imperialism in Africa today is economic,&quot; going on to expound on the extraction of wealth from the continent.

Other historians focus on the legal implications in international law and argue that the conference was only one of many (mostly bilateral) agreements between prospective colonists, which took place after the conference.

<text>Gamma globulins are a class of globulins, identified by their position after serum protein electrophoresis. The most significant gamma globulins are immunoglobulins (antibodies), although some immunoglobulins are not gamma globulins, and some gamma globulins are not immunoglobulins.

==Use as medical treatment==

Gamma globulin injections are usually given in an attempt to temporarily boost a patient&#x27;s immunity against disease.

Injections are most commonly used on patients having been exposed to hepatitis A or measles, or to make a kidney donor and a recipient compatible regardless of blood type or tissue match. Injections are also used to boost immunity in patients unable to produce gamma globulins naturally because of an immune deficiency, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia and hyper IgM syndrome. Such injections are less common in modern medical practice than they were previously, and injections of gamma globulin previously recommended for travelers have largely been replaced by the use of hepatitis A vaccine.

Gamma globulin infusions are also used to treat some immunological diseases, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), a disease in which the platelets are being attacked by antibodies, leading to seriously low platelet counts. It appears that gamma globulin causes the spleen to ignore the antibody-tagged platelets, thus allowing them to survive and function.

Another theory on how gamma globulin administration works in autoimmune disease is by overloading the mechanisms that degrade gamma globulins. Overloading the degradation mechanism causes the harmful gamma globulins to have a much shorter half of the life in sera.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be used in Kawasaki disease.

In 1953, gamma globulin was shown to prevent paralytic polio.

Being a product derived from bone marrow and lymph gland cells, gamma globulin injections, along with blood transfusions and intravenous drug use, can pass hepatitis C to their recipients. Once hepatitis C was identified in 1989, blood banks began screening all blood donors for the presence of the virus in their bloodstream. However, since hepatitis C is known to have been present since at least the 1940s, a gamma globulin shot received prior to the early 1990s put the recipient at risk of being infected.

Intravenous gamma globulin was FDA-approved in 2004 to reduce antibodies in a patient with kidney failure to allow that person to accept a kidney from a donor with a different blood type (ABO-incompatible), or who is an unacceptable tissue match. Stanley Jordan at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles pioneered this treatment.

==Pathology==
An excess is known as hypergammaglobulinemia. A deficiency is known as hypogammaglobulinemia.

A disease of gamma globulins is called a &quot;gammopathy&quot; (for example, in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance).

Brutton&#x27;s agammaglobulinemia is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by recurrent infections in the early-post natal period attributable to failure of pre-B cells to mature. Unless treated with Intravenous Immunoglobulins, patients often die.

<doc id="290521" wikidata="Q3886924" url="?curid=290521" title="Point of Rocks, Maryland">
<text>Point of Rocks is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Frederick County, Maryland. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 1,466.

Point of Rocks is named for a rock formation on the adjacent Catoctin Mountain, which was formed by the Potomac River cutting through the ridge in a water gap, a typical formation in the Appalachian Mountains. The formation is not visible from the town and can only be seen from boats on the river, or from the southern bank of the river in Virginia.

==History==
===Pre-settlement===
Indigenous peoples inhabited the Point of Rocks regions for centuries prior to European colonization. The Piscataway were one of the indigenous cultures to live in Point of Rocks, inhabiting an island in the Potomac River known today as Heater&#x27;s Island. Eventually, conflicts with neighboring tribes and European settlers forced the migration of the Piscataway from their ancestral homelands of Prince George&#x27;s County to Heater&#x27;s Island around 1699, though their population was severely decreased by an outbreak of smallpox in 1704.

The Piscataways remained on the island for a few more years before migrating north into Pennsylvania and New York.

About a decade after the Piscataway abandoned their settlement on Heater&#x27;s Island, the first European settler in Point of Rocks, Arthur Nelson, received a patent for a tract of land called &quot;Nelson&#x27;s Island.&quot; The Nelson Family retained their status as prominent landholders in Point of Rocks in the early-18th century, developing several plantations on which tobacco was grown. Commercial interests in the region led the Nelsons to petition for a road to be built connecting Frederick and &quot;Nelson&#x27;s Ferry,&quot; the first English-language name assigned to the village that became Point of Rocks. This road was eventually constructed and became known as Ballenger Creek Pike.

===19th and 20th centuries===
In the early-19th century, the arrival of the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&amp;O) Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O) Railroad led to an increase in settlement and industry in the Point of Rocks area. The village became a temporary terminus for both the C&amp;O Canal and the B&amp;O Railroad in 1828 when the companies went to court to determine which would control the right of way through the narrow passage between the Potomac River and Catoctin Mountain immediately west of Point of Rocks. After six years of court battles, the companies agreed to compromise and share the right of way, the B&amp;O Railroad eventually constructing a tunnel through the mountain to broaden its lines through the narrow water gap.

With the construction of the C&amp;O Canal and the B&amp;O Railroad and its strategic location on the Potomac River, Point of Rocks was poised to become a regional transportation hub and center of industrial activity. In 1835, Charles Johnson, the owner of the land on which Point of Rocks was built, had lots surveyed and streets laid out for a new town.

From the earliest days of European settlement in Point of Rocks, forced labor through indentured servitude and enslavement of African Americans drove the local economy. Tobacco plantations in the fertile lands of the lower Monocacy Valley were operated based on the labor of enslaved men and women. The plantation owners also used their slaves to build houses, places of business, and public buildings, such as St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church, completed in 1841 using the labor of enslaved men and women from the Duval Plantation. Nearby Licksville, a small community located near Noland&#x27;s Ferry crossing the Potomac River was the site of an active slave market.

====American Civil War====
Situated on the state line between Maryland and the seceded state of Virginia, Point of Rocks was the site of several small skirmishes and military actions during the Civil War. The B&amp;O Railroad and C&amp;O Canal were important targets for Confederate raiders across the Potomac River. In 1861, then Colonel Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson led a raid at Point of Rocks, shutting off the rail lines east of the town and capturing 56 locomotives and 300 rail cars.

Neighboring Loudoun County, Virginia, was home to several small pockets of Union supporters, including Quakers who lived in villages like Waterford and Lincoln who did not support secession or the Confederate cause for defending the institution of slavery. Point of Rocks became a haven for those families who were forced to flee Virginia.

In 1862, Captain Samuel C. Means, a native of Waterford, Virginia but then living in Point of Rocks where he was a merchant and B&amp;O Railroad station manager, raised a cavalry unit called the Loudoun Rangers, the only organized unit from Virginia to fight for the Union. The Loudoun Rangers spent most of 1862 and 1863 fighting alongside Cole&#x27;s Maryland Cavalry (the First Potomac Home Brigade) to protect the C&amp;O Canal and the B&amp;O Railroad from frequent Confederate raids. Cole&#x27;s Maryland Cavalry encamped at Point of Rocks, occupying St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church where they burned the interior furnishings.

Lt. Col. John S. Mosby and his 43rd Battalion of Virginia Cavalry, known as &quot;Mosby&#x27;s Raiders&quot;, crossed the Potomac and attacked Union garrison forces at Point of Rocks in 1864 in a brief campaign called the &quot;Calico Raid.&quot; The area was also the scene of military maneuvers and brief skirmishes during Valley Campaigns of 1864 and the Battle of Monocacy on July 9, 1864.

After the Civil War, Point of Rocks remained a place of conflict. In 1879, James Carroll was lynched in Point of Rocks after being accused of breaking into the home of Richard Thomas and raping his wife. Having fled down the C&amp;O Canal towpath to Georgetown, Carroll was apprehended on April 16, 1879. While being transported to Frederick for trial, a mob swarmed the train as it approached the station in Point of Rocks, removed Carroll from police custody, and hanged him in an adjacent field. The death of Carroll, whose alleged crimes have never been proven or disproven, was one of three recorded lynchings to take place in Frederick County.

In 1873, the B&amp;O Railroad opened its Metropolitan Branch, connecting Washington D.C. to its Old Main Line in a junction at Point of Rocks. A new station, which has become a noted town landmark, was erected the same year. The Gothic Revival styled brick building was designed by E. Francis Baldwin and is situated in the center of the junction of the two lines.

Several other prominent structures were built in the town during the Victorian era, including the town&#x27;s Methodist Church (1894), Holy Trinity Episcopal Church (1887, replaced in 1912), St. Luke&#x27;s Lutheran Church (1889), and Masonic Temple (1898).

===21st century===
In 2001, Duke Energy filed an application with the Maryland Public Service Commission to construct a power plant on the north edge of town. In November 2002, however, Duke officially canceled its proposal, though it retains property in the area.

The Point of Rocks railroad station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church was listed in 1978.

====Flooding====

Older portions of the town are on the Potomac River floodplain and have been repeatedly inundated. An ongoing Federal Emergency Management Agency program to reduce flood insurance payouts has resulted in the purchase and demolition of a large portion of structures on the lowest-lying properties.

==Geography==
Point of Rocks is located in southern Frederick County, on the north bank of the Potomac River, and is bordered to the west by U.S. Route 15, which here runs along the eastern base of Catoctin Mountain. Via US 15 it is north to Frederick, the county seat, and south across the Potomac River to Leesburg, Virginia. Maryland Route 28 leads east from Point of Rocks through rural Frederick County and Montgomery County to Rockville. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Point of Rocks has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==
==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
The community contains the Point of Rocks Bridge of U.S. Route 15 over the Potomac River into Virginia. The bridge is the first such crossing of the river upstream of the American Legion Memorial Bridge on I-495 in Montgomery County. The only other crossing between them is White&#x27;s Ferry.

Rail service through Point of Rocks began with the 1834 opening of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s main line, which ended at the next stop in Sandy Hook, Maryland, before the Harpers Ferry Crossing across the Potomac and into Virginia opened in 1839.

Point of Rocks is a passenger station stop on the MARC Brunswick Line. The station, designed by Ephraim Francis Baldwin, was built by the Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O) Railroad and completed in 1876. Marking the junction between CSX&#x27;s Metropolitan Subdivision (the current main line) and the Old Main Line Subdivision, it remains one of the former B&amp;O&#x27;s signature landmarks, and is a popular subject of railroad photography.

<text>Saudi Aramco ( ), officially the Saudi Arabian Oil Company or simply Aramco (formerly Arabian-American Oil Company), is a majority state-owned petroleum and natural gas company that is the national oil company of Saudi Arabia. , it is the fourth-largest company in the world by revenue and is headquartered in Dhahran. Saudi Aramco has both the world&#x27;s second-largest proven crude oil reserves, at more than , and largest daily oil production of all oil-producing companies. 

Saudi Aramco operates the world&#x27;s largest single hydrocarbon network, the Master Gas System. In 2024, its oil production total was 12.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, and it manages over one hundred oil and gas fields in Saudi Arabia, including 288.4 trillion standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas reserves. Along the Eastern Province, Saudi Aramco most notably operates the Ghawar Field (the world&#x27;s largest onshore oil field) and the Safaniya Field (the world&#x27;s largest offshore oil field).

On 11 December 2019, the company&#x27;s shares commenced trading on the Saudi Exchange. The shares rose to 35.2 Saudi riyals, giving it a market capitalization of about US$1.88 trillion, and surpassed the US$2 trillion mark on the second day of trading.

==History==

Saudi Aramco&#x27;s origins trace to the oil shortages of World War I and the exclusion of American companies from Mesopotamia by the United Kingdom and France under the San Remo Petroleum Agreement of 1920. The US administration had popular support for an &quot;Open Door policy&quot;, which Herbert Hoover, secretary of commerce, initiated in 1921. Standard Oil of California (SoCal) was among those US companies seeking new sources of oil from abroad.

The Saudi Arabian government granted a concession to SoCal in preference to a rival bid from the Iraq Petroleum Company. The concession allowed SoCal to explore for oil in Saudi Arabia. SoCal assigned this concession to a wholly owned subsidiary, California-Arabian Standard Oil (CASOC). In 1936, with the company having had no success at locating oil, the Texas Company (Texaco) purchased a 50% stake of the concession. After four years of fruitless exploration, the first success came with the seventh drill site in Dhahran in 1938, a well referred to as &quot;Dammam No. 7&quot;. This well immediately produced over , giving the company confidence to continue. On 31 January 1944, the company name was changed from California-Arabian Standard Oil Co. to Arabian American Oil Co. (or Aramco). In 1948, Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as Exxon) purchased 30% and Socony Vacuum (later Mobil) purchased 10% of the company, with SoCal and Texaco retaining 30% each. The newcomers were also shareholders in the Iraq Petroleum Co. and had to get the restrictions of the Red Line Agreement lifted in order to be free to enter into this arrangement.

In 1949, ARAMCO had made incursions into the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, leading to a border dispute between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia.
In 1950, King Abdulaziz threatened to nationalize his country&#x27;s oil facilities, thus pressuring Aramco to agree to share profits 50/50.

A similar process had taken place with American oil companies in Venezuela a few years earlier. The American government granted US Aramco member companies a tax break known as the golden gimmick equivalent to the profits given to King Abdulaziz. In the wake of the new arrangement, the company&#x27;s headquarters were moved from New York to Dhahran. In 1951, the company discovered the Safaniya Oil Field, the world&#x27;s largest offshore field. In 1957, the discovery of smaller connected oil fields confirmed the Ghawar Field as the world&#x27;s largest onshore field.

In 1975, the Saudi Arabia second five-year economic plan included a Master Gas Plan. Natural gas would be used to generate power, rather than flaring the gas. The plan counted on using the associated gas, but by 1985, Aramco was able to include a billion standard cubic foot per day (Bscfd) of non-associated gas. This non-associated gas was produced from the Kuff Formation, which is a limestone layer below the oil producing Arab Zone. In 1994, Aramco discovered more non-associated gas in the deeper Jawf sandstone formation, and built plants in Hawiyah and Haradh to process it. This increased the capacity of the Master Gas System to 9.4 billion scfd.

===Yom Kippur War===
In 1973, following US support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War, the Saudi Arabian government acquired a 25% &quot;participation interest&quot; in Aramco&#x27;s assets. It increased its participation interest to 60% in 1974. Aramco continued to operate and manage the former Aramco assets, including its concessionary interest in certain Saudi Arab oil fields, on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government until 1988. In November 1988, a royal decree created a new Saudi Arab company, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, to take control of the former Aramco assets (or Saudi Aramco) and took the management and operations control of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s oil and gas fields from Aramco and its partners. In 1989–90, high-quality oil and gas were discovered in three areas south of Riyadh: the Raghib area about southeast of the capital.

=== Persian Gulf War===
In September 1990, after the start of the Persian Gulf War, Aramco was expected to replace much of the oil production removed from the global market due to the embargo of Iraq and occupied Kuwait. This amounted to producing an extra 4.8 million barrels per day (Mbpd) to keep the global oil market stable. In addition, Aramco was expected to provide all of the coalition aviation and diesel needs. Aramco recommissioned 146 Harmaliyah, Khurais, and Ghawar oil wells with associated gas oil separation plants, and saltwater treatment pipeline, that had been during the 1980s oil price collapse. Daily production increased from 5.4 Mbpd in July to 8.5 Mbpd in December 1990 after a three-month de-mothball effort.

Starting in 1990, Aramco embarked on an expansion of crude oil sales in the Asian market. Agreements with South Korea, the Philippines, and China resulted. By 2016, about 70% of Aramco&#x27;s crude oil sales were to Asia.

===2000s===
In May 2001, Saudi Arabia announced the Gas Initiative, which proposed forming three joint ventures with eight IOCs for gas exploration on pure upstream acreage. Core Venture 1 included south Ghawar and north Rub&#x27; Al-Khali, Core Venture 2 included the Red Sea, while Core Venture 3 involved Shaybah and Kidan. In 2003, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalEnergies formed a partnership with Saudi Aramco in Core Venture 3. In 2004, Core Venture 1 became three separate joint ventures with Saudi Aramco holding 20%, one with Lukoil, a second with Sinopec, and a third with Repsol.

By 2004, Aramco was producing 8.6 million barrels per day (mbpd) out of a potential 10 mbpd. In 2005, Aramco launched a five-year plan to spend US$50 billion to increase their daily capacity to 12.5 mbpd by increasing production and refining capacity and doubling the number of drilling rigs.

In 2005, Saudi Aramco was the world&#x27;s largest company with an estimated market value of US$781 billion.

In June 2008, in response to crude oil prices exceeding US$130 a barrel, Aramco announced it would increase production to 9.7 million barrels per day (mbpd). Then as prices plummeted, Aramco stated in January 2009, that it would reduce production to 7.7 mbpd.

In 2011, Saudi Aramco started production from the Karan Gas Field, with an output of more than 400 million scf per day.

In January 2016, the Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud, announced he was considering listing shares of the state-owned company, and selling around 5% of them in order to build a large sovereign wealth fund.

On 26 April 2017, Saudi security forces thwarted an attempted attack on an Aramco oil distribution center involving an unmanned boat from Yemen.

The Wall Street Journal reported in September 2018, Aramco was considering a US$1 billion venture-capital fund to invest in international technology firms.

In June 2019, a report by Financial Times claimed that Aramco had been bearing the ministry-related expenses; boosting the finance ministry budget allocation. It also included Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih’s company-related and diplomatic trips, as well as his stays in luxurious hotels. However, an ally mentioned that Falih’s policies have delivered additional oil revenues that far exceeded his expenses.

In September 2019, Saudi Arabia appointed Yasir Al-Rumayyan as the Chairman of Aramco. Al-Rumayyan became head of the country’s sovereign wealth fund by replacing Khalid Al-Falih, who was holding the position since 2015.

===2012 cyber attack===
Aramco computers were attacked by a virus on 15 August 2012. The following day Aramco announced that none of the infected computers were part of the network directly tied to oil production, and that the company would soon resume full operations. Hackers claimed responsibility for the spread of the computer virus. The virus hit companies within the oil and energy sectors. A group named &quot;Cutting Sword of Justice&quot; claimed responsibility for an attack on 30,000 Saudi Aramco workstations, causing the company to spend months restoring their services. The group later indicated that the Shamoon virus had been used in the attack. Due to this attack, the main site of Aramco went down and a message came to the home page apologizing to customers. Computer security specialists said that &quot;The attack, known as Shamoon, is said to have hit &quot;at least one organization&quot; in the sector. Shamoon is capable of wiping files and rendering several computers on a network unusable.&quot; Richard Clarke suggests the attack was part of Iran&#x27;s retaliation for the US involvement in Stuxnet. Security researcher Chris Kubecka, who helped the company establish security after the attack, detailed the level of sophistication in her Black Hat USA 2015 presentation and episode 30 of Darknet Diaries.

===2019 drone attack===

On 14 September 2019, there was a drone attack on two Saudi Aramco plants: the Abqaiq oil processing facility and Khurais oil field. Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack. The attack cut 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of Saudi crude output, over 5% of the world&#x27;s supply. There were discussions by Saudi Arabian officials on postponing Aramco&#x27;s IPO, because the attacks &quot;sidelined more than half of the kingdom&#x27;s output&quot; of oil.

=== 2019 initial public offering (IPO) ===
Since around 2018, Saudi Arabia had been considering to put a portion of Saudi Aramco&#x27;s ownership, up to 5%, onto public trading via a staged initial public offering (IPO), as to reduce the cost to the government of running the company. While the IPO had been vetted by major banks, the IPO was delayed over concerns of Aramco&#x27;s corporate structure through 2018 into 2019. The September 2019 drone attacks on Aramco&#x27;s facilities also delayed the onset of the IPO.

On 9 April 2019, Aramco issued bonds collectively valued at US$12 billion. Its first international bond issue received more than US$100 billion in orders from foreign investors, which breaks all records for a bond issue by an emerging market entity.

Aramco announced on Sunday 3 November 2019 its plan to list 1.5% of its value as an IPO on the Tadawul stock exchange.

On 9 November 2019, Saudi Aramco released a 600-page prospectus giving details of the IPO. According to the specifications provided, up to 0.5% of the shares were locked for individual retail investors.

On 4 December 2019, Saudi Aramco priced its offering at 32 Saudi riyals (approximately US$8.53 at the time) per share. The company generated subscriptions of total amount equals US$119 billion representing 456% of total offer shares. It raised US$25.6 billion in its IPO, making it the world&#x27;s largest IPO, succeeding that of the Alibaba Group in 2014. The company commenced trading on Tadawul on 11 December 2019, with shares rising 10% to 35.2 riyals, giving the company a market capitalization of about US$1.88 trillion, and making Saudi Aramco the world&#x27;s largest listed company. The entire Tadawul has a market capitalization of US$2.22 trillion.

===Global Medium Term Note Programme===

According to a bourse filing made by Aramco, the likes of Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and NCB Capital were hired by the company for organizing investor calls prior to the planned transaction. The document published by one of the other banks said to be involved in the deal showed that the deal included BNP Paribas, MUFG, BofA Securities, SMBC Nikko, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Societe Generale, and BOC International. The company has reported a fall in the net profit of its third-quarter for November 2020, due to increased crude prices and a drop in its demand following the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== 2020s ===
On 10 March 2020 Saudi Aramco announced a global partnership with Formula One landing a multi-year deal.

On 17 June 2020, Saudi Aramco acquired a 70% share in SABIC, a chemicals manufacturing company.

In June 2020, Saudi Aramco laid off nearly 500 of its more than 70,000 employees, as global energy firms reduced their workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the workers who lost their job at Aramco were foreigners.

On 31 July 2020, Saudi Aramco lost its title as the world&#x27;s largest listed company by market capitalization to Apple.

On 9 August 2020, Saudi Aramco reported a 50% fall in net income for the first half of its financial year, as demand for oil and prices continued to fall due to the coronavirus crisis.

On 3 November 2020, Saudi Aramco reported a 44.6% drop in third-quarter net profit amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 14 December 2020, Saudi state TV announced that an oil tanker carrying over 60,000 metric tons of unleaded gasoline from an Aramco refinery at Yanbu, had been attacked by a smaller boat rigged with explosives.

In March 2021, Saudi Aramco announced that earnings in 2020 fell by nearly 45% compared with 2019, as lockdowns around the world following the COVID-19 pandemic curbed demand for oil.

On 19 March 2021, an Aramco refinery was attacked by six bomb-laden drones. The attack, which was claimed by Houthi rebels, started a fire but caused no injuries or damage, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.

On 21 March 2021, Saudi Aramco signed an agreement to secure China&#x27;s energy supplies for the next 50 years, and also to develop new technologies to combat climate change. More recently, they signed a deal with a consortium led by EIG.

In July 2021, Saudi Aramco appointed former HSBC Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver to the company&#x27;s board of directors.

In October 2021, Saudi Aramco announced plans to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from its wholly-owned operations by 2060.

On 20 November 2021, Houthi fighters took credit for launching 14 drones at military targets in Riyadh, Abha, Jizan, Najran, and Jeddah, and Aramco&#x27;s refineries in Jeddah.

In 2021, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Aramco was not trying to diversify at the same rate as other oil companies, such as Shell and BP. Rather, Aramco announced in 2021 that the company intended to increase crude capacity from 12m barrels a day to 13m barrels by 2027.

In February 2022, following crude&#x27;s ascent to nearly $95 per barrel, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Aramco boosted oil prices for clients in Asia, the United States, and Europe.

In March 2022, Houthi fighters attacked an Aramco storage site in Jeddah causing a fire in two storage tanks. The incident occurred during qualifying for the 2022 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.

On 11 May 2022, Saudi Aramco became the largest (most valuable) company in the world by market cap, surpassing Apple Inc.

In August 2022, Saudi Aramco announced that it would acquire Valvoline&#x27;s petroleum unit for $2.65 billion.

In March 2023, Saudi Aramco announced that they had seen record profits of $161 billion as prices of petrol soared following the COVID-19 pandemic. The figures eclipsed the numbers posted by ExxonMobil and Shell, who reported $55.7 and $39.9 billion in profit respectively.

In March 2023, Saudi Aramco announced it was going to acquire a 10% stake in China&#x27;s Rongsheng Petrochemical Co. Ltd, with an estimated purchase price of $3.6 billion, and plans to build a new refining and petrochemical complex in northeast China through a joint venture.

In September 2023, it was announced that Saudi Aramco had reached an agreement with the Latin American private equity fund, Southern Cross Group to acquire the Santiago-headquartered fuel retailer, Esmax Distribución SPA, operator of Petrobras-branded service stations in Chile. The acquisition marks Saudi Aramco&#x27;s entry into the South American fuel retailing market, and beginning in May 2024, the 300 Petrobras service stations in Chile will be gradually converted to Aramco service stations.

In September 2023, Indian engineering and construction giant Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) signed a contract with Saudi Aramco. The Jafoor unconventional gas development expansion project in Saudi Arabia where L&amp;T will build a gas processing plant and major processing facilities is worth $2.9 billion.

In December 2023, Saudi Aramco acquired 40% shares in Gas &amp; Oil Pakistan for an undisclosed amount.

==Operation==
Saudi Aramco is headquartered in Dhahran, but its operations span the globe and include exploration, production, refining, chemicals, distribution and marketing. All these activities of the company are monitored by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources together with the Supreme Council for Petroleum and Minerals. However, the ministry has much more responsibility in this regard than the council.

===Exploration===
A significant portion of the Saudi Aramco workforce consists of geophysicists and geologists. Saudi Aramco has been exploring for oil and gas reservoirs since 1982. Most of this process takes place at the EXPEC Advanced Research Center. Originally, Saudi Aramco used Cray Supercomputers (CRAY-1M) in its EXPEC Advanced Research Center (ECC) to assist in processing the colossal quantity of data obtained during exploration and in 2001, ECC decided to use Linux clusters as a replacement for the decommissioned Cray systems. ECC installed a new supercomputing system in late 2009 with a disk storage capacity of 1,050 terabytes (i.e., exceeding one petabyte), the largest storage installation in Saudi Aramco&#x27;s history to support its exploration in the frontier areas and the Red Sea.

===Refining and chemicals===
While the company did not originally plan on refining oil, the Saudi government wished to have only one company dealing with oil production. Therefore, on 1 July 1993, the government issued a royal decree merging Saudi Aramco with Samarec, the country&#x27;s oil refining company. The following year, a Saudi Aramco subsidiary acquired a 40% equity interest in Petron Corporation, the largest crude oil refiner and marketer in the Philippines. Since then, Saudi Aramco has taken on the responsibility of refining oil and distributing it in the country. In 2008, Saudi Aramco sold its entire stake to the Ashmore Group, a London-listed investment group. Ashmore acquired an additional 11% when it made a required tender offer to other shareholders. By July 2008, Ashmore, through its SEA Refinery Holdings B.V., had a 50.57% of Petron&#x27;s stock. Ashmore&#x27;s payment was made in December 2008. In December 2008, Ashmore acquired PNOC&#x27;s 40% stake. In the same month, San Miguel Corporation (SMC) said it was in the final stages of negotiations with the Ashmore Group to buy up to 50.1% of Petron. In 2010, SMC acquired majority control of Petron Corporation.

Currently, Saudi Aramco&#x27;s refining capacity is (International joint and equity ventures: , domestic joint ventures: 1,900 mpbd, and wholly owned domestic operations: .)

Saudi Aramco&#x27;s downstream operations are shifting emphasis to integrate refineries with petrochemical facilities. Their first venture into it is with Petro Rabigh, which is a joint venture with Sumitomo Chemical Co. that began in 2005 on the coast of the Red Sea. In order to become a global leader in chemicals, Aramco will acquire 50% of Royal Dutch Shell&#x27;s stake in their refiner in Saudi Arabia for US$631 million.

Saudi Aramco at one point had been exploring projects in Pakistan, including a $10 billion refinery project in Gwandar which has since been cancelled. In 2022 it was revealed that Saudi Aramco was creating a joint venture with North Huajin Chemical Industries group to create a new company called Huajin Aramco Petrochemical Company which would develop a 300,000 bpd refining facility with ethylene steam cracking capabilities.

===Shipping===
Saudi Aramco has employed several tankers to ship crude oil, refined oil, and natural gas to various countries. It used to have its own created subsidiary company, Vela International Marine, which was merged with Bahri company, to handle shipping to North America, Europe, and Asia. It is a stakeholder in the King Salman Global Maritime Industries Complex, a shipyard that will be the largest in the world when complete.

=== Global investment ===
Saudi Aramco expanded its presence worldwide to include the three major global energy markets of Asia, Europe, and North America. In April 2019, Aramco has signed a deal to acquire a 13% stake in South Korean oil refiner Hyundai Oilbank for US$1.24 billion. Moreover, on 11 April 2019, Aramco signed an agreement with Poland’s leading oil refiner PKN Orlen to supply it with Arabian Crude Oil.

=== Liquefied natural gas ===
Aramco is planning to be a major producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the world. It sold its first cargo of LNG from Singapore to an Indian buyer. The company is looking globally for potential joint ventures and partnerships to achieve its goal regarding LNG market.

==Saudization==
The original concession agreement included Article 23; as Ali Al-Naimi pointed out, this was a &quot;key building block in the shaping of Saudi society for decades to come.&quot; It reads, &quot;The enterprise under this contract shall be directed and supervised by Americans who shall employ Saudi nationals as far as practicable, and in so far as the company can find suitable Saudi employees it will not employ other nationals.&quot; The first company school was started in May 1940 in the Al-Khobar home of Hijji bin Jassim, company interpreter, translator and first instructor. Al-Naimi pointed out, &quot;From the beginning, the development of Aramco was directly tied to the betterment of Saudi Arabia.&quot; Another school was located in Dhahran in 1941, and was called the Jebel School. Boys hired into entry-level positions attended at 7 AM for four hours, followed by four hours of work in the afternoon. In 1950, Aramco built schools for 2,400 students. In 1959, Aramco sent the first group of Saudi students to college in the States. In 1970, Aramco started hiring its first high school graduates, and in 1979 started offering college scholarships. In 1965, Zafer H. Husseini was named the first Saudi manager and in 1974, Faisal Al-Bassam was named the first Saudi vice president. One of the early students was Al-Naimi, who was named the first Saudi president of Aramco in November 1983. As Al-Naimi states, &quot;The oil company committed itself to developing qualified Saudis to become fully educated and trained industry professionals.&quot; Al-Naimi acknowledged Thomas Barger&#x27;s championing of Saudization, &quot;You, of all of Aramco&#x27;s leaders, had the greatest vision when you supported the training effort of Saudi Arab employees during its early days. That visionary support and effort is bearing fruit now and many executive positions are filled by Saudis because of that effort.&quot; In 1943, 1,600 Saudis were employed at Aramco, but by 1987, nearly two-thirds of Aramco&#x27;s 43,500 strong workforce were Saudis. In 1988, Al-Naimi became CEO and Hisham Nazer became chairman, the first Saudis to hold those positions. The &quot;pinnacle of Saudization&quot; occurred when the Shaybah oil field came on line in July 1998, after a three-year effort by a team consisting of 90% Saudis. The Aramco of 2016 still maintained an expatriate workforce of about 15%, so Aramco can, in the words of Al-Naimi, &quot;be sure it is getting access to the latest innovations and technical expertise.&quot;

Saudi Aramco has emitted 59.26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent since it began operations, accounting for 4.38% of worldwide anthropogenic emissions since 1965.

In a letter sent to nine international banks reportedly hired by Aramco to assist it in arranging its US$2 trillion market debut, ten environmental groups warned about the listing causing a highly possible hindrance in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and end human rights abuses committed by the Saudi regime.

On 6 November 2019, Saudi Aramco joined the World Bank&#x27;s initiative to reduce gas flaring to zero by 2030. The firm reported flaring of less than 1% of its total raw gas production in the first half of 2019.

== Greenhouse gas emissions ==
According to environmentalists Aramco is responsible for more than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions since 1965. Most of this is from the use of the oil they sold, for example burning gasoline in car engines. In greenhouse gas accounting such emissions from use of a product are called &quot;scope 3&quot; emissions. Aramco has no plan to limit scope 3 emissions. However the government says it will have net zero carbon emissions by 2060 within the country. In October 2023, Saudi Aramco announced a direct air capture pilot program in partnership with Siemens Energy to be completed in 2024.

On 9 December, 2024, Aramco along with SLB and Linde signed an agreement to build a carbon capture and storage project in Jubail, Saudi Arabia. Aramco will be owning 60% of the project while SLB and Linde will hold 20% each. The first phase has been estimated to be completed by the end of 2027, while capturing and storing up to 9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year.

== Controversies ==

=== 2007 Haradh gas pipeline explosion ===

On 18 November 2007, reports came out that a natural gas pipeline explosion had taken the lives of several workers, the death toll was later determined to be 34. Aramco asserts it was a purely maintenance-related incident.

=== Organizational culture ===
On 9 December 2020, the Financial Times published an article about an engineer, whose family claims that Saudi Aramco was negligent in handling his COVID-19 infection. According to his family, he had been asking the company and authorities for help, three weeks before his death, but was simply asked to keep his gloves and mask on. Saudi Aramco did not formally contact his family until approximately 14 hours after his death, refused to release his body, and allegedly erased information from his mobile phone. His grieving family had to do without financial support for almost five months, and only received $400,000 in benefits, back pay and insurance after the Financial Times had started asking questions.

In the same article, five whistleblowers accuse Aramco of bullying and mismanagement. One former employee expressed his concerns about the company&#x27;s highly dangerous failure to pressure-test valves and mains units, detailing cracks in the refinery structure and sinking of roads and foundations. The refinery runs a real risk of becoming Aramco&#x27;s Piper Alpha, said another expatriate employee, who also accuses Aramco of lacking a culture of challenge, facilitating ineptitude and laziness.

=== Treatment of workers ===
In March 2020, Saudi Aramco came under fire after photos of a migrant worker dressed as a large hand-sanitizer dispenser went viral on social media. People on Twitter condemned the act as &quot;modern-day slavery,&quot; &quot;humiliating&quot; and &quot;dehumanizing.&quot; According to the company, the display was organized without the approval of Aramco officials.

=== Strong-arming investors ===
In 2019, sources told the Financial Times that wealthy families of Saudi Arabia had been coerced into joining the Saudi Aramco IPO.

== Lobbying and research projects ==

Saudi Aramco has funded almost 500 studies in last five years on energy issues and collaborated with the United States Department of Energy on projects to boost oil production, such as developing more efficient gasoline, enhanced oil recovery and methods to increase the flow of oil from wells. Since 2016, Saudi Arabia has spent around $140 million on lobbying to influence public opinion and policies in the US. In an effort to keep gasoline cars competitive, Saudi Aramco is working on a device which would trap some of the carbon dioxide upon attaching it to cars running on gasoline. Saudi Aramco has partnered with Hyundai to develop a fuel for gas-electric vehicles which will run on petroleum.

<text>Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP or SPE) is a laboratory test that examines specific proteins in the blood called globulins. The most common indications for a serum protein electrophoresis test are to diagnose or monitor multiple myeloma, a monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS), or further investigate a discrepancy between a low albumin and a relatively high total protein. Unexplained bone pain, anemia, proteinuria, chronic kidney disease, and hypercalcemia are also signs of multiple myeloma, and indications for SPE. Blood must first be collected, usually into an airtight vial or syringe. Electrophoresis is a laboratory technique in which the blood serum (the fluid portion of the blood after the blood has clotted) is applied to either an acetate membrane soaked in a liquid buffer, or to a buffered agarose gel matrix, or into liquid in a capillary tube, and exposed to an electric current to separate the serum protein components into five major fractions by size and electrical charge: serum albumin, alpha-1 globulins, alpha-2 globulins, beta 1 and 2 globulins, and gamma globulins.

==Acetate or gel electrophoresis==
Proteins are separated by both electrical forces and electroendoosmostic forces. The net charge on a protein is based on the sum charge of its amino acids, and the pH of the buffer. Proteins are applied to a solid matrix such as an agarose gel, or a cellulose acetate membrane in a liquid buffer, and electric current is applied. Proteins with a negative charge will migrate towards the positively charged anode. Albumin has the most negative charge, and will migrate furthest towards the anode. Endoosmotic flow is the movement of liquid towards the cathode, which causes proteins with a weaker charge to move backwards from the application site. Gamma proteins are primarily separated by endoosmotic forces. The drawing of the electrophoretic bands provided by the laboratory may be difficult to remember, and medical students, residents, nurses, and non-specialized medical practitioners may find visual mnemonics useful to recall the five main bands and the shape of normal serum electrophoresis. 

==Capillary electrophoresis==
In capillary electrophoresis, there is no solid matrix. Proteins are separated primarily by strong electroendosmotic forces. The sample is injected into a capillary with a negative surface charge. A high current is applied, and negatively charged proteins such as albumin try to move towards the anode. Liquid buffer flows towards the cathode, and drags proteins with a weaker charge.
==Serum protein fractions==

===Albumin===
Albumin is the major fraction in a normal SPEP. A fall of 30% is necessary before the decrease shows on electrophoresis. Usually a single band is seen. Heterozygous individuals may produce bisalbuminemia – two equally staining bands, the product of two genes. Some variants give rise to a wide band or two bands of unequal intensity but none of these variants is associated with disease. Increased anodic mobility results from the binding of bilirubin, nonesterified fatty acids, penicillin and acetylsalicylic acid, and occasionally from tryptic digestion in acute pancreatitis.

Absence of albumin, known as analbuminaemia, is rare. A decreased level of albumin, however, is common in many diseases, including liver disease, malnutrition, malabsorption, protein-losing nephropathy and enteropathy.

===Albumin – alpha-1 interzone===
Even staining in this zone is due to alpha-1 lipoprotein (high density lipoprotein – HDL). Decrease occurs in severe inflammation, acute hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Also, nephrotic syndrome can lead to decrease in albumin level; due to its loss in the urine through a damaged leaky glomerulus. An increase appears in severe alcoholics and in women during pregnancy and in puberty.

The high levels of AFP that may occur in hepatocellular carcinoma may result in a sharp band between the albumin and the alpha-1 zone.

===Alpha-1 zone===
Orosomucoid and antitrypsin migrate together but orosomucoid stains poorly so alpha 1 antitrypsin (AAT) constitutes most of the alpha-1 band. Alpha-1 antitrypsin has an SG group and thiol compounds may be bound to the protein altering their mobility. A decreased band is seen in the deficiency state. It is decreased in the nephrotic syndrome and absence could indicate possible alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. This eventually leads to emphysema from unregulated neutrophil elastase activity in the lung tissue. The alpha-1 fraction does not disappear in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, however, because other proteins, including alpha-lipoprotein and orosomucoid, also migrate there. As a positive acute phase reactant, AAT is increased in acute inflammation.

Bence Jones protein may bind to and retard the alpha-1 band. 

===Alpha-1 – alpha-2 interzone===
Two faint bands may be seen representing alpha 1-antichymotrypsin and vitamin D binding protein. These bands fuse and intensify in early inflammation due to an increase in alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, an acute phase protein.

===Alpha-2 zone===
This zone consists principally of alpha-2 macroglobulin (AMG or A2M) and haptoglobin. There are typically low levels in haemolytic anaemia (haptoglobin is a suicide molecule which binds with free haemoglobin released from red blood cells and these complexes are rapidly removed by phagocytes). Haptoglobin is raised as part of the acute phase response, resulting in a typical elevation in the alpha-2 zone during inflammation. A normal alpha-2 and an elevated alpha-1 zone is a typical pattern in hepatic metastasis and cirrhosis.

Haptoglobin/haemoglobin complexes migrate more cathodally than haptoglobin as seen in the alpha-2 – beta interzone. This is typically seen as a broadening of the alpha-2 zone.

Alpha-2 macroglobulin may be elevated in children and the elderly. This is seen as a sharp front to the alpha-2 band. AMG is markedly raised (10-fold increase or greater) in association with glomerular protein loss, as in nephrotic syndrome. Due to its large size, AMG cannot pass through glomeruli, while other lower-molecular weight proteins are lost. Enhanced synthesis of AMG accounts for its absolute increase in nephrotic syndrome. Increased AMG is also noted in rats with no albumin indicating that this is a response to low albumin rather than nephrotic syndrome itself

AMG is mildly elevated early in the course of diabetic nephropathy.

===Alpha-2 - beta interzone===
Cold insoluble globulin forms a band here which is not seen in plasma because it is precipitated by heparin. There are low levels in inflammation and high levels in pregnancy.

Beta lipoprotein forms an irregular crenated band in this zone. High levels are seen in type II hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and in the nephrotic syndrome.

===Beta zone===
Transferrin and beta-lipoprotein (LDL) comprises the beta-1. Increased beta-1 protein due to the increased level of free transferrin is typical of iron deficiency anemia, pregnancy, and oestrogen therapy. Increased beta-1 protein due to LDL elevation occurs in hypercholesterolemia. Decreased beta-1 protein occurs in acute or chronic inflammation.

Beta-2 comprises C3 (complement protein 3). It is raised in the acute phase response. Depression of C3 occurs in autoimmune disorders as the complement system is activated and the C3 becomes bound to immune complexes and removed from serum. Fibrinogen, a beta-2 protein, is found in normal plasma but absent in normal serum. Occasionally, blood drawn from heparinized patients does not fully clot, resulting in a visible fibrinogen band between the beta and gamma globulins.

===Beta-gamma interzone===
C-reactive protein is found in between the beta and gamma zones producing beta/gamma fusion. IgA has the most anodal mobility and typically migrates in the region between the beta and gamma zones also causing a beta/gamma fusion in patients with cirrhosis, respiratory infection, skin disease, or rheumatoid arthritis (increased IgA). Fibrinogen from plasma samples will be seen in the beta gamma region. Fibrinogen, a beta-2 protein, is found in normal plasma but absent in normal serum. Occasionally, blood drawn from heparinized patients does not fully clot, resulting in a visible fibrinogen band between the beta and gamma globulins.

===Gamma zone===
The immunoglobulins or antibodies are generally the only proteins present in the normal gamma region. Of note, any protein migrating in the gamma region will be stained and appear on the gel, which may include protein contaminants, artifacts, or certain medications. Depending on whether an agarose or capillary method is used, interferences vary. Immunoglobulins consist of heavy chains (μ, δ, γ, α, and ε) and light chains (κ and λ). A normal gamma zone should appear as a smooth &#x27;blush&#x27;, or smear, with no asymmetry or sharp peaks. The gamma globulins may be elevated (hypergammaglobulinemia), decreased (hypogammaglobulinaemia), or have an abnormal peak or peaks. Note that immunoglobulins may also be found in other zones; IgA typically migrates in the beta-gamma zone, and in particular, pathogenic immunoglobulins may migrate anywhere, including the alpha regions.

Hypogammaglobulinaemia is easily identifiable as a &quot;slump&quot; or decrease in the gamma zone. It is normal in infants. It is found in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia. IgA deficiency occurs in 1:500 of the population, as is suggested by a pallor in the gamma zone. Of note, hypogammaglobulinema may be seen in the context of MGUS or multiple myeloma.

If the gamma zone shows an increase the first step in interpretation is to establish if the region is narrow or wide. A broad &quot;swell-like&quot; manner (wide) indicates polyclonal immunoglobulin production. If it is elevated in an asymmetric manner or with one or more peaks or narrow &quot;spikes&quot; it could indicate clonal production of one or more immunoglobulins,

Polyclonal gammopathy is indicated by a &quot;swell-like&quot; elevation in the gamma zone, which typically indicates a non-neoplastic condition (although is not exclusive to non-neoplastic conditions). The most common causes of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia detected by electrophoresis are severe infection, chronic liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue diseases.

A narrow spike is suggestive of a monoclonal gammopathy, also known as a restricted band, or &quot;M-spike&quot;. To confirm that the restricted band is an immunoglobulin, follow up testing with immunofixation, or immunodisplacement/immunosubtraction (capillary methods) is performed. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb), also migrate in this region and may be misinterpreted as a monoclonal gammopathy, and may also be identified by immunofixation or immunodisplacement/immunosubtraction as they are structurally comparable to human immunoglobulins. The most common cause of a restricted band is an MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance), which, although a necessary precursor, only rarely progresses to multiple myeloma. (On average, 1%/year.) Typically, a monoclonal gammopathy is malignant or clonal in origin, Myeloma being the most common cause of IgA and IgG spikes. chronic lymphatic leukaemia and lymphosarcoma are not uncommon and usually give rise to IgM paraproteins. Note that up to 8% of healthy geriatric patients may have a monoclonal spike. Waldenström&#x27;s macroglobulinaemia (IgM), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), amyloidosis, plasma cell leukemia and solitary plasmacytomas also produce an M-spike.

Oligoclonal gammopathy is indicated by one or more discrete clones.

Lysozyme may be seen as a band cathodal to gamma in myelomonocytic leukaemia in which it is released from tumour cells.

<doc id="290532" wikidata="Q220650" url="?curid=290532" title="Joseph-Ignace Guillotin">
<text>Joseph-Ignace Guillotin ()(28 May 1738 – 26 March 1814) was a French physician, politician, and freemason who proposed on 10 October 1789 the use of a device to carry out executions in France, as a less painful method of execution than existing methods. Although he did not invent the guillotine and opposed the death penalty, his name became an eponym for it. The actual inventor of the prototype was a man named Tobias Schmidt, working with the king&#x27;s physician, Antoine Louis.

==Early life and education==
Guillotin was born on 28 May 1738 in Saintes, France, the second son of Joseph-Alexandre Guillotin and Catherine Agatha Martin. Legend has it that he was born prematurely because his mother was in distress after hearing the screams of a man being tortured to death on the breaking wheel.

Guillotin&#x27;s early education was by the Jesuits in Bordeaux and he earned a Master of Arts degree at the College of Aquitaine of the University of Bordeaux in December 1761. The essay that he wrote to earn the degree impressed the Jesuits so much that they invited him to become a professor of literature at the Irish College in Bordeaux. However, he left after a few years and travelled to Paris to study medicine, becoming a pupil of Antoine Petit. He gained a diploma from the faculty at Reims in 1768 and his doctorate at the School of Medicine in Paris in 1770, which also gave him the title of Doctor-Regent. This allowed him to teach medicine in Paris.

==Career==
In Paris, Guillotin became a well-known physician. By 1775, he was concerned with issues of torture and death. That year, he wrote a memo proposing that criminals be used as subjects in medical experiments. Although he recognised that as cruel, he considered it preferable to being put to death. In 1784, when Franz Mesmer began to publicize his theory of &quot;animal magnetism&quot;, which was considered offensive by many, Louis XVI appointed a commission to investigate it and Guillotin was appointed a member, along with Jean Sylvain Bailly, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, Antoine Lavoisier, and Benjamin Franklin. The commission declared Mesmer to be a fraud, and this put Guillotin in the public eye.

===Political career and guillotine===
In December 1788, Guillotin drafted a pamphlet entitled &quot;Petition of the Citizens Living in Paris&quot;, concerning the proper constitution of the Estates-General. The French parliament attempted to suppress his pamphlet and summoned him to give an account of his opinions, but the crowd during his testimony was very much in support of him, and he was released, which served to increase his popularity. On 2 May 1789, he became one of 10 Paris deputies in the Estates-General of 1789 and was secretary to the body from June 1789 to October 1791. On 20 June 1789, the National Assembly, as the members were now calling themselves, found itself locked out of its chamber. Guillotin suggested they reconvene in a nearby &quot;jeu de paume&quot; court, where the members swore the Tennis Court Oath, vowing &quot;not to separate and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the Constitution of the kingdom is established&quot;.

As a member of the assembly, Guillotin initially directed his attention towards medical reform. As a member of the Poverty Committee, he toured the Hôtel-Dieu and contributed to the report that exposed the unsanitary conditions there. He also became first chair of the Health Committee and submitted a bill for medical reform in 1791.

At the same time, he was also concerned with criminal law reform. His experiences as a doctor had led him to oppose capital punishment: at first, he attempted to abolish it, but was unsuccessful. At that time, beheading in France was typically by axe or sword, which did not always cause immediate death. Additionally, beheading was reserved for the nobility, while commoners were typically hanged, which could take a long time, as the techniques whereby the victim&#x27;s neck was broken by the noose had not yet been invented. Other methods included burning at the stake, the breaking wheel, death by boiling, and dismemberment. Guillotin realised that, if he could not eliminate executions, he could at least make them more humane.

On 10 October 1789, he proposed that &quot;the criminal shall be decapitated; this will be done solely by means of a simple mechanism.&quot; The &quot;mechanism&quot; was defined as &quot;a machine that beheads painlessly&quot;. His proposal appeared in the Royalist periodical, &quot;Les Actes des Apôtres&quot;. In all, Guillotin proposed six articles:
# All punishments for the same class of crime shall be the same, regardless of the criminal (i.e., there would be no privilege for the nobility)
# When the death sentence is applied, it will be by decapitation, carried out by a machine
# The family of the guilty party will not suffer any legal discrimination
# It will be illegal to anyone to reproach the guilty party&#x27;s family about his/her punishment
# The property of the convicted shall not be confiscated
# The bodies of those executed shall be returned to the family if so requested

Guillotin assumed that, if a fair system was established where the only method of capital punishment was by mechanical decapitation, then the public would feel more appreciative of their rights. Despite this proposal, Guillotin was opposed to the death penalty, and hoped that a more humane and less painful method of execution would be the first step towards total abolition. He also hoped that, as the decapitation machine would kill quickly without prolonged suffering, this would reduce the size and enthusiasm of crowds that often witnessed executions.

On 1 December 1789, Guillotin made a remark during a follow-up speech to the Assembly about capital punishment. He was quoted (or possibly misquoted) as saying, &quot;Now, with my machine, I cut off your head in the twinkling of an eye, and you never feel it!&quot; The statement quickly became a popular joke, and a few days after the debate a comic song about Guillotin and &quot;his&quot; machine circulated, forever tying his name to it, despite the fact that he was not at all involved in its design or construction. The &quot;Moniteur&quot; of 18 December 1789 deplored the joking but repeated Guillotin&#x27;s &quot;twinkling of an eye&quot; statement for posterity.

The articles were fairly controversial as the rights of the criminals and their families had not previously been considered, but they were accepted over the course of several years, with the &quot;decapitation by simple machine&quot; finally being accepted on 3 June 1791, with the result that his proposals became law on 20 March 1792. Meanwhile, the Assembly had commissioned Antoine Louis to build such a device. His proposal was presented on 17 March, and the first executions using it took place on 25 April 1792. However, by October 1791, Guillotin had already retired from the Assembly, returning to practise medicine. During the Reign of Terror, he moved to Arras to become the director of the military hospital there, returning to Paris a year later.

Towards the end of the Reign of Terror, a letter from the Comte de Méré to Guillotin fell into the hands of the public prosecutor, Fouquier-Tinville in which the Count, who was to be executed, commended his wife and children to Guillotin&#x27;s care. The authorities demanded Guillotin inform them of the whereabouts of the Count&#x27;s wife and children. As Guillotin either would not or could not give the information, he was arrested and imprisoned. He was freed from prison in the general amnesty of 9 Thermidor (27 July) 1794 after Robespierre fell from power.

In November 1795, a letter was published in the &quot;Moniteur&quot; claiming that the guillotine&#x27;s victims survived for several minutes after beheading. Guillotin was shocked, and for the remainder of his life, he deeply regretted that the machine was named after him. His continued efforts to abolish the death penalty were hampered by the widespread belief that as the very person who proposed using a decapitation machine he must surely be in favour of it.

===Resumption of medical career===
Guillotin became one of the first French doctors to support Edward Jenner&#x27;s discovery of vaccination, and in 1805 was the chairman of the Central Vaccination Committee in Paris. He also founded one of the precursors of the National Academy of Medicine.

==Personal life==
===Family===
The association with the guillotine so embarrassed Guillotin&#x27;s family that they petitioned the French government to rename it; when the government refused, they instead changed their own family name. By coincidence, another person named Guillotin was indeed executed by the guillotinehe was J.M.V. Guillotin, a doctor of Lyon. This coincidence may have contributed to erroneous statements that J-I Guillotin was put to death on the machine that bears his name; however, in reality, Guillotin died at home in Paris in 1814 of natural causes, aged 75, specifically from a carbuncle, and is now buried in the Père-Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. He was married to Louise Saugrain, sister of the physician and chemist Antoine Saugrain.

===Freemasonry===
Joseph Guillotin was initiated into Freemasonry, in 1765 at &quot;La Parfaite Union&quot; lodge in Angoulême. Very active as a mason, he joined several other lodges. As a deputy of the Grand Lodge from 1772 he took part in the birth of the Grand Orient of France and attended all its conventions until 1790. In 1773, he became Worshipful Master of the lodge &quot;La Concorde Fraternelle&quot; in Paris. In 1776, he founded the &quot;La Vérité&quot; lodge and often attended Les Neuf Sœurs.

==In modern fiction==
Guillotin features in Andrew Miller&#x27;s Costa prize-winning novel &quot;Pure&quot;. He is also a primary character in the 1992 novel &quot;Dr Guillotine&quot;, written by the actor Herbert Lom. He is also the main character in the French drama series &quot;La Révolution&quot;.

<doc id="290534" wikidata="Q729426" url="?curid=290534" title="Ice diving">
<text>Ice diving is a type of penetration diving where the dive takes place under ice. Because diving under ice places the diver in an overhead environment typically with only a single entry/exit point, it requires special procedures and equipment. Ice diving is done for purposes of recreation, scientific research, public safety (usually search and rescue/recovery) and other professional or commercial reasons.

The most obvious hazards of ice diving are getting lost under the ice, hypothermia, and regulator failure due to freezing. Scuba divers are generally tethered for safety. This means that the diver wears a harness to which a line is secured, and the other end of the line is secured above the surface and monitored by an attendant. Surface supplied equipment inherently provides a tether, and reduces the risks of regulator first stage freezing as the first stage can be managed by the surface team, and the breathing gas supply is less limited. For the surface support team, the hazards include freezing temperatures and falling through thin ice.

==Environment==
Ice diving is underwater diving in water partly or completely covered by ice which may be an overhead obstacle to surfacing at some point of the dive, making ice diving a subclass of penetration diving. This can be in fresh or seawater, and the salinity of the water constrains the possible temperature range of the water. In fresh water the coldest water is in contact with the ice, at , and the warmest may be , some distance below the ice, which is the temperature at which fresh water reaches its highest density. In sea water the temperature can be a little lower, around , depending on salinity. Air temperatures can be considerably lower.

==Hazards==
Hazards of ice diving include the general hazards of underwater diving, the specific environmental hazards of penetration diving, in particular the hazard of not finding the exit area, and some hazards that are more specific to the low temperatures. There may also be hazards specific to the particular dive site.
*Low environmental temperatures can cause:
**Frostbite:
**Hypothermia:, which can reduce the mental acuity, reasoning capacity and cognitive function of the diver, possibly leading to accidents and work errors. More severe cases can be incapacitate the diver and are directly life-threatening.
**Non-freezing cold injury
**Regulator freezing:
*Entrapment by moving ice: When diving through a natural gap in ice cover, it may be possible for the separate floes to move relative to each other, under the influence of wind or water movement, which can change the geometry of the entry and exit area, creating a risk of closing the gap through which the diver must exit the water.
*Falling through weak ice cover: The ice layer may be flawed or insufficiently thick to support the load of the dive team.
*Slipping on ice: Diving gear is heavy out of the water, and the water on the diver&#x27;s exposure suit can quickly freeze, reducing mobility and traction, and ice is an inherently slippery material.
*Wild animals like sharks and polar bears:

===Regulator freezing===

Regulator freezing is a malfunction of a diving regulator where ice formation on or in one or both stages causes the regulator to function incorrectly. Several types of malfunction are possible, including jamming of the first or second stage valves in any position from closed to more frequently fully open, which can produce a free-flow capable of emptying the diving cylinder in minutes, ice formation in the exhaust valve opening causing leakage of water into the mouthpiece, and shedding of ice shards into the inhalation air, which may be inhaled by the diver, possibly causing laryngospasm.

When air expands during pressure reduction in a regulator, the temperature drops and heat is absorbed from the surroundings. It is well known that in waters colder than use of a regulator to inflate a lift bag, or to purge a regulator underwater for just a few seconds, will start many regulators free-flowing and they will not stop until the air supply to the regulator is stopped. Some cold water scuba divers install shuttle type (sliding sleeve) shut off valves at each second stage regulator so if the second stage freezes open, the low pressure air can be shut off to the frozen second stage allowing them to switch to the alternative second stage and abort the dive.

The most familiar effect of regulator freezing is where the second stage demand valve starts free flowing due to ice formation around the inlet valve mechanism that prevents the valve from closing after inhalation. Besides the problem of free flow from second stage icing, a less known problem is free ice formation, where ice forms and builds up inside the second stage but does not cause the regulator to free flow, and the diver may not be aware that the ice is there. This free ice build-up inside the second stage can break loose in the form of a sliver or chunk and pose a significant choking hazard because the ice can be inhaled, which may trigger laryngospasm. This can be a particular problem with regulators having ice-shedding internal surfaces that are teflon coated, which allows the ice to break free of the internal surfaces and helps to prevent the regulator from free flowing by clearing the ice. This may be helpful in keeping the demand valve mechanism free to move, but the ice still forms in the regulator and has to go somewhere when it breaks loose.

With most second stage scuba regulators, ice forms and builds up on internal components, and the gap between the valve lever and fulcrum point is reduced and eventually filled by the build-up of ice that forms, preventing the inlet from fully closing during exhalation . Once the valve starts leaking, the second stage components get even colder due to the cooling effect of the continuous flow, creating more ice and sometimes an even greater free flow. With some regulators the refrigerating effect is so great, that water around the exhaust valve freezes, reducing exhaust flow, increasing exhalation effort, and producing positive pressure in the valve body, making it difficult to exhale through the regulator. This may cause the diver to loosen their grip on the mouthpiece and exhale around the mouthpiece.

With some regulators, once the regulator starts free-flowing the flow escalates into a full free-flow, and delivers air to the diver at temperatures cold enough to freeze mouth tissue in a short time, causing frostbite. The effect increases with depth, and the deeper the diver is, the faster the breathing gas will be lost. In some cold water fatalities, by the time the diver&#x27;s body is recovered there is no gas left in the cylinder, and the regulator has warmed up and melted the ice, destroying the evidence, and leading to a finding of death by drowning due to running out of gas.

====Mechanism of icing====

When the high pressure gas passes through the regulator first stage, the pressure drop from cylinder pressure to inter-stage pressure causes a temperature drop as the gas expands. The higher the cylinder pressure the greater the drop in pressure and the colder the gas gets in the low pressure hose to the second stage. An increase in flow will increase the amount of heat lost and the gas will get colder, as heat transfer from the surrounding water is limited. If the breathing rate is low to moderate (15 to 30 lpm) the risk of ice formation is less.

The factors that influence ice formation are:
*Cylinder pressure: - The temperature drop is proportional to the pressure drop. See general gas equation. 
*Breathing or flow rate: - The heat loss is proportional to the mass flow of gas. 
*Depth: - Mass flow is proportional to downstream pressure for a given volumetric flow. 
*Water temperature: - Rewarming of the expanded gas and the regulator mechanism depends on water temperature, and the temperature difference between the gas and the water. 
*Duration of flow:- During high flow rates heat loss is faster than rewarming, and gas temperature will drop. 
*Regulator design and materials: - The materials, arrangement of parts, and gas flow in the regulator affect reheating and deposition of ice. The thermal conductivity of the regulator components will affect the rate of heat transfer. 
*Breathing gas composition: - The amount of heat needed to raise the temperature depends on the specific heat capacity of the gas.

Once the water temperature drops below there is not enough heat in the water to rewarm the components of the second stage being chilled by the cold gas from the first stage, and most second stages start forming ice.

The cold inter-stage air enters the second stage and is reduced to ambient pressure, which cools it further, so it chills the second stage inlet valve components to well below freezing and as the diver exhales, the moisture in the exhaled breath condenses on the cold components and freezes. Heat from the surrounding water may keep the second stage regulator components warm enough to prevent the build-up of ice. The diver&#x27;s exhaled breath at , does not have enough heat to compensate for the cooling effect of the expanding incoming air once the water temperature is much below , and once the water temperature drops below there is not enough heat in the water to rewarm the regulator components fast enough to keep moisture in the divers exhaled breath from freezing if the diver is breathing hard. This is why the CE cold water limit is at which is the point at which many scuba regulators start retaining free ice.

The longer the gas expands at a high rate, the more cold gas is produced, and for a given rate of reheating, the colder the regulator components will get. Keeping high flow rates to as short a time as possible will minimise ice formation.

The air temperature above the ice may be considerably colder than the water under the ice, and the specific heat of air is much less than that of water. As a consequence, there is less warming of the regulator body and inter-stage gas when out of the water, and it is possible for further cooling to occur. This increases the risk of second stage icing, and the gas in the cylinder may be cooled sufficiently for condensation of residual moisture to occur during first stage expansion, as the expanding gas may cool below the dew point specified for high pressure breathing gas, which could cause internal icing of the first stage. This can be avoided by restricting breathing from the set in the cold air to a minimum.

A similar effect occurs with the second stage. Air which has already expanded and cooled through the first stage expands again and cools further at the demand valve of the second stage. This cools the components of the second stage and water in contact with them may freeze. Metal components around the moving parts of the valve mechanism allow heat transfer from the surrounding slightly warmer water, and from exhaled air from the diver, which is considerably warmer than the surroundings.

Second stage freezing can develop quickly from the moisture in the exhaled breath, so regulators that prevent or reduce contact of the diver&#x27;s exhaled breath with the colder components and the area where the cold gas enters will usually build up less ice on critical components. The heat transfer qualities of the materials can also significantly influence ice formation and freezing risk. Regulators with exhaust valves that do not seal well will form ice quickly as ambient water leaks into the casing. All second stages can develop ice when the inlet gas temperature averages below and this can happen in water temperatures up to . The ice that forms may or may not cause a free flow, but any ice inside the regulator casing may present an inhalation hazard.

A second stage freeze is also likely to happen with the valve open, causing a free flow, which may precipitate a first stage freeze if not immediately stopped. If the flow through the frozen second stage can be stopped before the first stage freezes, the process can be halted. This may be possible if the second stage is fitted with a shutoff valve, but if this is done, the first stage must be fitted with an over-pressure valve, as closing the supply to the second stage disables its secondary function as an over-pressure valve.

Cold water function testing is used to compare a regulator&#x27;s performance in cold water against various standards, mainly the U.S. Navy Experimental Diving Unit&#x27;s unmanned cold water test procedures (1994), and European CE open circuit standard EN 250 of 1993. Testing may include failure modes and effects analysis, and other issues relating to manufacturing, quality assurance and documentation. The introduction of a complete computerised breathing simulator system by ANSTI Test Systems Ltd in the UK made possible the accurate breathing simulator testing at all realistic water temperatures that is the current practice.

====Surface supplied breathing equipment====
In most cases surface supplied helmets and full face mask demand valves do not get cold enough to develop ice because the umbilical works as a heat exchanger and warms the air up to the water temperature. If the surface supplied diver bails out to scuba emergency gas supply, then the problems are identical to those for scuba, though the metal gas block and bent tube gas passages before the second stage will provide some warming of inter-stage gas beyond what a scuba set would normally provide.

If the surface air temperatures are well below freezing, (below ) excessive moisture from the volume tank can freeze into ice granules which can then travel down the umbilical and end up in the helmet intake, blocking off air to the demand valve, either as a reduction in flow or a complete blockage if the granules accumulate and form a plug. Ice formation in a surface supplied system can be prevented by use of an effective moisture separation system and regular draining of condensate. Desiccating filters can also be used. Use of HP gas for surface supply is not generally a problem as the HP compressors use a filter system that dries the air sufficiently to keep the dew point below . Keeping the surface section of the umbilical exposed to the cold air as short as possible will also help. The portion in the water is not normally cold enough to be a problem.

====Factors increasing the risk of regulator freeze====
*Unsuitable regulator design and construction
*High flow rates through the regulator
**Purging – affects both regulator stages.
**Buddy breathing – affects both regulator stages.
**Octo breathing – particularly effects the first stage if both second stages are supplied by the same first stage.
**Filling a lift bag or DSMB from the breathing regulator – affects both stages.
**long bursts of dry suit inflation or BC inflation while breathing from the same regulator – affects the first stage, and may cause freezing at the inflation valve.
**High breathing rate due to exertion – affects both stages.
*Low water temperature
**Water directly under the ice is likely to be colder than deeper water in fresh water.
*Breathing through the regulator above the ice in sub-freezing temperatures, where there is no warming of the regulator of interstage gas by ambient water – affects both stages.

====Precautions to reduce risk of regulator freezing====
*Keeping the interior of the second-stage completely dry before entering the water
**Not breathing from the regulator until underwater. When testing the regulator before the dive, the diver can inhale only, avoid exhaling through the regulator as the moisture in the breath will freeze in the demand valve.
*Preventing water from entering the second-stage chamber during or between dives This requires keeping the regulator in the mouth while it is immersed.
*Depressing the purge button for no more than 5 seconds prior to or during the dive, and avoiding even this if possible
*Avoiding heavy work loads that would significantly increase the breathing rate and volume of air moved through the valve with each breathing cycle
*Ensuring that the scuba air is sufficiently moisture-free
*Keeping the regulator in warm surroundings prior to the dive, if possible.

====Mitigation====
Kirby Morgan have developed a stainless steel tube heat exchanger (&quot;Thermo Exchanger&quot;) to warm the gas from the first stage regulator to reduce the risk of second stage scuba regulator freeze when diving in extremely cold water at temperatures down to . The length and relatively good thermal conductivity of the tubing, and the thermal mass of the block allows sufficient heat from the water to warm the air to within one to two degrees of the surrounding water.

====Managing a regulator freeze====
*The diver will close the cylinder valve supplying the frozen regulator and change over to breathing from the standby regulator. This conserves the gas and allows the frozen regulator time to defrost.
*If tethered, the diver can signal to the line tender with the previously agreed emergency signal (usually five or more tugs on the rope) while breathing from free-flowing regulator (less desirable option used if no alternative gas supply is available). Five pulls will usually indicate that the surface tender should pull the diver to the surface, or in this case, the hole in the ice.
*If diving without a tether the diver should follow the guideline back to the hole and avoid leaving the line unless able to use a jump line or can see the ice hole.
*Emergency ascent if directly under the hole in the ice and in visible range. (least desirable option short of drowning)
Protocol for a regulator freeze often includes aborting the dive.

====Low pressure inflator freeze====
It is possible for the dry suit or buoyancy compensator inflation valve to freeze while inflating, for similar reasons to regulator freeze. If this happens it can cause a runaway ascent if it is not dealt with immediately. If possible the low pressure inflator hose should be disconnected before it freezes onto the valve, while dumping air to control buoyancy. Excessive dumping of air may leave the diver too negative so it is preferable to have at least two controllable buoyancy systems, such as a dry suit and BCD, preferably supplied from different first stages. If the dry suit inflation valve freezes open it may allow water to leak into the suit once disconnected, so this usually results in aborting the dive.

Most inflator problems can be avoided by keeping gear maintained and dry before the dive, using a low flow rate for inflation and avoiding long bursts, and having warm water at the dive site to thaw gear since ambient air temperature is usually well below freezing and this usually causes BCD issues before the dive.

=== Wind chill ===

Temperatures above the ice may be considerably lower than water temperature, which is limited by freezing point of the water, and may be further exacerbated by wind chill. This can be a limiting factor on the endurance of the surface team if inadequately insulated and sheltered, and can have an impact on the divers on exiting the water in wet exposure suits.

== Procedures ==


Whether ice diving inherently constitutes technical diving has been debated within the recreational diving community., but since technical diving is legally recreational diving, it is unclear why this matters. For the recreational or professional diver it is a high risk environment requiring additional safety measures.

Ice diving is a team diving activity because each diver&#x27;s lifeline requires a . This person is responsible for paying out and taking in line so that the diver does not get tangled, and for rope signal communications with the diver. Professional teams will also require a and diving supervisor.

Under some circumstances a guide line can be used instead of a lifeline as a reference for the divers to return to the hole at the end of the dive or in an emergency in a similar way to cave diving or wreck penetration. In these cases the divers should be competent in procedures for diving with a guideline.

Polar diving experience has shown that buoyancy control is a critical skill affecting safety.

Typical procedure for a scuba dive under ice:
* A snow shovel is used to clear the snow and ice from the area.
* An ice saw or a chain saw is used to cut a hole in the ice.
* A weatherproof area is used for the divers to suit up.
* The diver and tender on the surface are connected by a rope lifeline and harness. The harness is typically put on over the dry suit but under the BC or other buoyancy device so that the diver remains tethered even if he or she must remove the air cylinder or buoyancy control device. The harness fits over the shoulders and around the back such that the tender on the surface can, in an emergency, haul an unconscious diver back to the hole. The harness should not be able to slide up or down the diver&#x27;s torso when pulled in line with the body.
* Rope signals or voice communications systems must be used.
* A tethered standby diver is ready on the surface.
* One or two divers may dive at the same time from the same hole, each with his or her own rope. Using two ropes runs little risk of getting tangled together, but using three significantly increases this risk.
* If the regulator free-flows and freezes, the diver should close it down and switch to the backup, and terminate the dive.
* When diving in pack ice, the surface team must constantly monitor ice movement to ensure that the exit is not compromised.
* The diver must ensure that there is always a positive indication of the route to the exit area. A tether to a surface tender is usually preferable as it can be used to communicate, but if this is not practicable a reel and distance line is an alternative.
* The risk of attack by predators and aggressive wildlife should be considered. Polar bear, walrus, and leopard seal are potential hazards within their ranges.
* Gas management for an overhead environment is appropriate.
*Deployment of a single tethered scuba diver is a reasonably safe alternative to free-swimming buddy team diving. The tethered scuba diver is equipped with a full-face mask with voice communications, high capacity scuba air supply, and an independent emergency air supply. A lifeline with communications cable is secured to a body harness on the diver and is handled by a surface tender who is in constant voice communication with the diver. A similarly equipped standby diver is available on the surface.

== Equipment ==
Since diving under the ice takes place in cold climates, there is typically a large amount of equipment required. Besides each person&#x27;s clothing and exposure-protection requirements, including spare mitts and socks, there is basic scuba gear, back-up scuba gear, tools to cut a hole in the ice, snow removal tools, safety gear, some type of shelter, lines, and refreshments required.

The diver can use a weight harness, integrated weight buoyancy control device, or a weight belt with two buckles on it so the weights can not be accidentally released which would cause a run-away ascent into the ice sheet.

Dry suits with adequate thermal undergarments are standard environmental protection for ice diving, though in some cases thick wetsuits may suffice. Hoods, boots and gloves are also worn. Full-face masks can provide more protection for the divers&#x27; facial skin.

===Exposure suits===
Because of the water temperature (between 4 °C and 0 °C in fresh water, approximately -1.9 °C for normal salinity sea water), exposure suits are mandatory.
* Pre- and post-dive thermal protection is critical for safety and diver function.
* Hand thermal protection is important to retain functionality and prevent cold injury.
* The diver should be kept warm throughout the dive, but active rewarming by external heating and heavy exercise should be avoided directly after the dive, as the effect of cold on risk of decompression sickness is not fully understood.
Some consider a dry suit mandatory; however, a thick wetsuit may be sufficient for hardier divers. A wetsuit can be pre-heated by pouring warm water into the suit. A hood and gloves (recommended three-finger mitts or dry gloves with rings) are necessary, and dry suit divers have the option of using hoods and gloves that keep their head and hands dry. Some prefer to use a full face diving mask to essentially eliminate any contact with the cold water.
The biggest drawback to using a wet suit is the chilling effect on the diver caused by the water evaporating from the suit after a dive. This can be reduced by using a heated shelter.

===Scuba equipment===
Diving regulators suitable for cold-water are used. All regulators have a risk of freezing and free flowing, but some models fare better than others. Environmentally sealed regulators avoid contact between the surrounding water and the moving parts of the first stage by isolating them in an antifreeze fluid (e.g. Poseidon) or by siting the moving parts behind a diaphragm and transmitting the pressure through a pushrod (e.g. Apeks).

Although there is no universally accepted standard, at least one agency recommends the use of two non-freezing (rated for ice diving) regulators arranged as follows: primary first stage with primary second stage, BCD inflation hose, and submersible pressure gauge (SPG); secondary first stage with secondary second stage (octopus), dry suit inflation hose, and SPG, although only one SPG is needed for a single cylinder or manifolded twins.

The two first stages are mounted on independently closable valves, as a first stage freeze free-flow can only be stopped by shutting off the air supply from the cylinder until the valve has thawed out. The second regulator is there to supply the remaining gas when the first regulator is shut off. A second-stage isolation valve used in conjunction with a first-stage overpressure relief valve may be effective as a quick method to manage demand valve free-flow.
* Regulators should be checked to ensure that they perform effectively at low temperatures before use far from a free surface.
* A minimum of two independent regulators is recommended for diving under ice, as scuba apparatus has a tendency to free-flow under polar conditions Divers must be competent in change-over procedures, including shutdown of the free-flowing equipment.
* Keeping regulators warm and dry before diving, and limiting breathing from the regulator before immersion will reduce the risk of regulator freezing. Purging or any other cause of high flow rate markedly increases the probability of freezing and should be kept to an absolute minimum.

Redundant systems usually typically comprise double cylinders with a primary and alternate regulator. Each of the second stages is supplied its own first stage, which can be shut down at the cylinder valve in an emergency, such as a free flow. The diver&#x27;s buoyancy compensator is on a different first stage to the dry suit so if there is an issue with one the diver can still control their buoyancy.

Some divers use a primary regulator on a 7-foot hose and a secondary on a necklace, this is useful when it may be necessary for the divers to swim in single file, though this is not always relevant for ice diving. The reason for the primary being on a long hose is to ensure the donated regulator is known to be working. The long hose will also allow some additional heat transfer from the water to the gas in the hose.

===Buoyancy and weighting===
* A drysuit should be used with a buoyancy compensator for ice diving unless the diver is exposed to greater risk with a buoyancy compensator than without one.
* A tethered diver, who is deployed to work independently, should preferably be equipped with full face mask, voice communications to the surface and redundant air supply. This is often obligatory for professional divers.
* Most divers prefer to be more negative for ice diving than in open water like in most overhead environments, and ability to disconnect the low pressure inflator on a BCD or drysuit is a critical skill.

===Tethers and guidelines===
When diving under ice it can be easy to become disoriented, and a guideline back to the entry and exit hole is an important safety feature. The choice between using a tether (lifeline) controlled by a surface tender or a reel line deployed by the diver under ice depends on various factors.

A tether connected to the diver and controlled by a surface tender is usually the safest option for most diving under ice, and the only reasonable choice when any significant current is present. The tether will prevent the diver from being swept away by current, and is generally strong enough for the surface party to pull the diver back to the hole unless it gets snagged. It may be the only option permitted by regulation or code of practice for professional divers on scuba.
Recreational divers are not constrained by law or codes of practice, and there are a number of situations where experienced ice divers may choose to use a continuous guideline that is not attached to them, and which they control during the dive. This practice is more favoured for long penetration distances where entanglement and line fouling become greater risks. It is not recommended for divers new to the ice environment or for conditions which do not include very good visibility, no current, no moving ice and places to tie off the guideline along the route.
A guideline may have advantages over a tether if:
*All of the divers have both significant penetration and ice diving skills and experience, and
**The environment is stable, the ice is fast and there are no significant currents or other water movement, or
**The dive is to be deep (below ) or the dive is planned for more than total underwater distance from the entry point, where a long tether may be difficult to manage
Or:
*There is significant risk of entanglement if a tether is used
Divers may also choose to use a guideline for the primary part of the dive and clip on to a tether for decompression as currents are usually strongest near the surface.

===Surface team===
*Adequate thermal protection must be provided to tenders and standby divers.
:* Warm waterproof shoes.
:* Warm anorak for cold weather.
:* Warm cap covering the ears.
:* Sunglasses with a UV filter to protect the eyes in sunny days.
:* Lip-care stick and cream to protect hands and face against cold and wind.
;* A device like crampons to aid in traction on ice. especially when cutting the hole or carrying gear

==Location==
Ice diving is generally done by recreational divers where the dive sites they use in summer freeze over in winter, and by public safety divers when necessary in the course of their occupation, mostly in emergencies. Most of these dives are done in North America and northern Europe where there is a large population of recreational divers, a large area of fresh water that can freeze over in winter, and sufficiently cold winters to form ice strong enough to use as a platform for diving. There is also some scientific diving under ice, mostly for biological and ecological research, and a small amount of extreme adventure ice diving by recreational divers, in exotic locations, like Antarctica.

===Regions===
Regions known for ice diving include the White Sea and Lake Baikal, in Russia, Antarctica, the Tromsø region in Norway, Resolute Bay and Baffin Island in Canada, the fjords and coastal waters around Greenland, and the Åland archipelago in Finland.

== Training and certification==
Training includes learning about how ice forms, how to recognize unsafe ice conditions, dive site preparation, equipment requirements, and safety drills.
* Ice divers should be skilled in the use of drysuits, choice of thermal insulation, buoyancy control and weighting, and should be competent and experienced with the specific equipment they will use.
* If lifelines are used, both divers and tenders must be competent to use them.
Other skills required by the ice diver include:
* How to impact the underside of the surface ice if the diver&#x27;s weight belt falls off for any reason and the diver ascends uncontrollably and rapidly.
* How to deal with a frozen air-supply system using a redundant back-up system.
* What to do in the event the diver loses contact with the line or the line tender does not get feedback from the diver in response to signals given to the diver.
Several agencies offer certification in recreational ice diving.

Specialised ice diving training for public safety divers in planning and executing emergency ice diving operations is available, as their duties may put them in the water under circumstances of greater risk than other professional and recreational divers. A minimum physical and medical fitness level is one of the prerequisites for the training. These divers are also trained in surface support activity necessary for risk management in these situations.

<text>Josep Maria Carreras Coll (; born 5 December 1946), better known as José Carreras (, ), is a Catalan operatic tenor from Spain who is particularly known for his performances in the operas of Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini.

Born in Barcelona, he made his debut on the operatic stage at 11 as Trujamán in Manuel de Falla&#x27;s &quot;El retablo de Maese Pedro&quot;, and went on to a career that encompassed over 60 roles, performing in the world&#x27;s leading opera houses and on numerous recordings. He gained fame with a wider audience as one of the Three Tenors, with Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti, in a series of large concerts from 1990 to 2003. He is also known for his humanitarian work as president of the José Carreras International Leukaemia Foundation (La Fundació Internacional Josep Carreras per a la Lluita contra la Leucèmia), which he established following his own recovery from the disease in 1988.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Carreras was born in Sants, a working-class district in Barcelona. He was the youngest of Antònia Coll i Saigi and Josep Carreras i Soler&#x27;s three children. In 1951, his family emigrated to Argentina in search of a better life. However, this move abroad proved unsuccessful, and within a year they had returned to Sants where Carreras was to spend the rest of his childhood and teenage years.
He showed an early talent for music and particularly singing, which intensified at the age of six when he saw Mario Lanza in &quot;The Great Caruso&quot;. The story recounted in his autobiography and numerous interviews is that after seeing the film, Carreras sang the arias incessantly to his family, especially &quot;La donna è mobile&quot;, often locking himself in the family&#x27;s bathroom when they became exasperated with his impromptu concerts. At that point, his parents, with the encouragement of his grandfather Salvador Coll, an amateur baritone, found the money for music lessons for him. At first he studied piano and voice with Magda Prunera, the mother of one of his childhood friends, and at the age of eight, he also started taking music lessons at Barcelona&#x27;s Municipal Conservatory.

At just eight years old, he also gave his first public performance, singing &quot;La donna è mobile&quot;, accompanied by Magda Prunera on the piano, on Spanish National Radio. A recording of this still exists and can be heard on the video biography, &quot;José Carreras – A Life Story&quot;. On 3 January 1958, at the age of eleven, he made his debut in Barcelona&#x27;s great opera house, the Gran Teatre del Liceu, singing the boy soprano role of Trujamán in Manuel de Falla&#x27;s &quot;El retablo de Maese Pedro&quot;. A few months later, he sang for the last time as a boy soprano at the Liceu in the second act of &quot;La Bohème&quot;.

Throughout his teenage years, he continued to study music, moving on to the Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu and taking private voice lessons, first with Francisco Puig and later with Juan Ruax, whom Carreras has described as his &quot;artistic father&quot;. Following the advice of his father and brother, who felt that he needed a &quot;backup&quot; career, he also entered the University of Barcelona to study chemistry, but after two years he left the university to concentrate on singing.

===1970s and 1980s===

Juan Ruax encouraged Carreras to audition for what was to become his first tenor role at the Liceu, Flavio in &quot;Norma&quot;, which opened on 8 January 1970. Although only a minor role, the few phrases he sang caught the attention of the production&#x27;s leading lady, the eminent soprano and fellow Catalan, Montserrat Caballé. She asked him to sing Gennaro with her in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot;, which opened on 19 December 1970. It was his first principal adult role, and the one which he considers to be his true debut as a tenor. In 1971, he made his international debut in a concert performance of &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; in London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall, again with Caballé singing the title role. Caballé was instrumental in promoting and encouraging his career for many years, appearing in over fifteen different operas with him, while her brother and manager, Carlos Caballé, was also Carreras&#x27;s manager until the mid-1990s.

During the 1970s Carreras&#x27;s career progressed rapidly. In late-1971, he won first prize in Parma&#x27;s prestigious Voci Verdiane competition which led to his Italian debut as Rodolfo in &quot;La bohème&quot; at the Teatro Regio di Parma on 12 January 1972. Later that year he made his American debut as Pinkerton in &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; with the New York City Opera. Other major house debuts followed – the San Francisco Opera in 1973, as Rodolfo; the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company in 1973, as Alfredo in &quot;La traviata&quot;; the Vienna Staatsoper in 1974, as the Duke of Mantua in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;; London&#x27;s Royal Opera House in 1974, as Alfredo; the New York Metropolitan Opera in 1974, as Cavaradossi in &quot;Tosca&quot;; and La Scala, Milan in 1975, as Riccardo in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;. By the age of 28, he had already sung the tenor lead in 24 different operas in both Europe and North America, and had an exclusive recording contract with Philips, which resulted in valuable recordings of several less often performed Verdi operas, notably &quot;Il Corsaro&quot;, &quot;I due Foscari&quot;, &quot;La battaglia di Legnano&quot;, &quot;Un giorno di regno&quot; and &quot;Stiffelio&quot;.

Carreras&#x27;s leading ladies during the 1970s and 1980s included some of the most famous sopranos and mezzo-sopranos of the day: Montserrat Caballé, Birgit Nilsson, Viorica Cortez, Renata Scotto, Ileana Cotrubaş, Sylvia Sass, Teresa Stratas, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Frederica von Stade, Agnes Baltsa, Teresa Berganza, and Katia Ricciarelli. His artistic partnership with Ricciarelli began when they both sang in the 1972 &quot;La bohème&quot; at Parma and lasted for thirteen years, both in the recording studio and on stage. They later made a studio recording of &quot;La bohème&quot; for Philips Classics and can be heard together on over 12 other commercial recordings of both operas and recitals, predominantly on the Philips and Deutsche Grammophon labels.

Of the many conductors he worked with during this period, the one with whom Carreras had the closest artistic relationship and who had the most profound influence on his career was Herbert von Karajan. He first sang under Karajan in the Verdi Requiem at Salzburg on 10 April 1976, with their final collaboration in a 1986 production of &quot;Carmen&quot;, again at Salzburg. With Karajan&#x27;s encouragement, he increasingly moved towards singing heavier lirico-spinto roles, including &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, and &quot;Carmen&quot;, which some critics have said were too heavy for his natural voice and may have shortened his vocal prime. (See the section on Carreras&#x27;s voice.)

The 1980s saw Carreras occasionally moving outside the strictly operatic repertoire, at least in the recording studio, with recitals of songs from zarzuela, musicals and operettas. He also made full-length recordings of two musicals – &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1985) and &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1986) – both with Kiri Te Kanawa as his co-star. The recording of &quot;West Side Story&quot; was unusual in two respects: Carreras was chosen and conducted by Leonard Bernstein. Bernstein was conducting for the first time nearly 30 years after he composed the music, and a full-length documentary was made about the recording sessions. In a now-viral clip, the star tenor had problems with the syncopated rhythms and elocution in his solo on &quot;Something&#x27;s Coming&quot; and was relentlessly corrected by Bernstein. His 1987 Philips recording of the Argentine folk mass, &quot;Misa Criolla&quot;, conducted by its composer, Ariel Ramírez, brought the work to a worldwide audience. Although many of Carreras&#x27;s stage performances are available on video, he also ventured into film. In 1986, he portrayed the 19th century Spanish tenor Julián Gayarre in &quot;Romanza Final&quot; (The Final Romance) and in 1987, he started working on a film version of &quot;La bohème&quot; directed by Luigi Comencini.

It was during the filming of &quot;La bohème&quot; in Paris that he was found to be suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and given a 1 in 10 chance of survival. However, he recovered from the disease after undergoing a gruelling treatment involving chemotherapy, radiation therapy and an autologous bone marrow transplant at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. Following his recovery, he gradually returned to both the operatic and the concert stage, embarking on a tour of come-back recitals in 1988 and 1989 and singing with Montserrat Caballé in &quot;Medea&quot; (Mérida, Spain 1989) and in the world premiere of Balada&#x27;s &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; (Barcelona, 1989).

===1990–present===

The 1990s continued to see Carreras performing on the operatic stage in &quot;Carmen&quot; and &quot;Fedora&quot; and making role debuts in &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; (Peralada, 1990), Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Stiffelio&quot; (London, 1993), and Wolf-Ferrari&#x27;s &quot;Sly&quot; (Zurich, 1998). However, his opera performances became less frequent as he increasingly devoted himself to concerts and recitals. His final operatic performances at the Gran Teatre del Liceu, the opera house where his career began, were in &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; (March 2001). He reprised the title role in &quot;Sly&quot; in Tokyo in 2002 and in 2004 performed at the Vienna State Opera in fully staged versions of the final act of &quot;Carmen&quot; and Act 3 of &quot;Sly&quot;. In April 2014, Carreras returned to the opera stage after a ten-year absence singing the title role of Christian Kolonovits&#x27;s opera, &quot;El Juez&quot; (The Judge) in its premiere at the Arriaga Theatre in Bilbao. He reprised the role in August 2014 at the Festival Erl in Austria and in January 2015 at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg.

In 1990 the first Three Tenors concert took place in the Baths of Caracalla in Rome on the eve of the 1990 FIFA World Cup finals. It was originally conceived to raise money for Carreras&#x27;s leukemia foundation and as a way for his colleagues, Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti, to welcome their &quot;little brother&quot; back to the world of opera. However, it and the subsequent Three Tenors concerts brought Carreras a fame that went far beyond the opera house. It is estimated that over a billion people around the world watched the television broadcast of the 1994 Three Tenors concert in Los Angeles. By 1999, the CD from the first Three Tenors concert in Rome had sold an estimated 13 million copies, making it the best-selling classical recording of all time. Carreras is the center of a subplot in the 1996 episode &quot;The Doll&quot; in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; television series, in which he is never referred to by name but instead as &quot;the other guy&quot; in the Three Tenors; he is erroneously referred to as being Italian (perhaps intentionally). The early 1990s also saw Carreras serving as the Musical Director for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, and performing in a worldwide concert tour in tribute to his first singing hero, Mario Lanza.

By the 2000s Carreras&#x27;s recording and live concert repertoire had moved largely to art song, Neapolitan songs, the light classical genre, and &#x27;easy-listening&#x27;. He has also increasingly performed and recorded with artists from outside the classical music world, such as Diana Ross, Edyta Górniak, Lluís Llach, Peter Maffay, Udo Jürgens, Klaus Meine, Charles Aznavour, Kim Styles, Sarah Brightman, Vicky Leandros, Jackie Evancho, Sissel Kyrkjebø, Debbie Harry, Majida El Roumi, and Giorgia Fumanti. Beginning in 2002, Carreras scaled back his live performances to recitals and orchestral concerts.

In an interview published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 8 May 2009, Carreras announced that he would no longer perform principal opera roles but was still open to recitals.

===Humanitarian work===

Following his own recovery from leukaemia, Carreras sought both to repay the debt he owed to medical science and to improve the lives and care of other leukaemia sufferers. On 14 July 1988, he established the Fundació Internacional Josep Carreras per a la Lluita contra la Leucèmia (known in English as the José Carreras International Leukaemia Foundation) in Barcelona. The foundation, which publishes a tri-monthly magazine on its activities, &quot;Amigos de la Fundación&quot;, concentrates its efforts in four main areas:
*Development of clinical research into the cure and treatment of leukaemia through scholarships and research grants.
*Campaigns to increase bone marrow and cord blood donation for leukaemia patients requiring transplants, along with the operation of REDMO, the Spanish national registry of bone marrow donors.
*Strengthening of the research and clinical infrastructures in both leading international institutions and hospitals and laboratories in the developing world.
*Provision of social services to leukemia patients and their families, including free accommodation near transplant centres.

The José Carreras International Leukaemia Foundation also has affiliates in the U.S., Switzerland, and Germany, with the German affiliate the most active of the three. Since 1995, Carreras has presented an annual live television benefit gala in Leipzig to raise funds for the foundation&#x27;s work in Germany. Since its inception, the gala alone has raised well over €71 million. Carreras also performs at least 20 charity concerts a year in aid of his foundation and other medical related charities. He is an Honorary Member of the European Society for Medicine and the European Haematology Association, an Honorary Patron of the European Society for Medical Oncology, and a Goodwill Ambassador for UNESCO.

===Awards and distinctions===

Carreras has received numerous awards and distinctions for both his artistic and humanitarian work. These include: Knight Grand Cross (First Class) of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant of Thailand (2019); Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur (France); Knight Grand Cross and Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (20 May 1996 and 3 April 1991, respectively); Grand Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria (1999); the Cruz de Oro del Orden Civil de la Solidaridad Social from Queen Sofia of Spain, the Prince of Asturias Prize for Art (joint winner, 1991), the Grand Cross of Merit from the Federal Republic of Germany and the Gold Medal of the Generalitat of Catalonia (June 1984).

Carreras has received the Bavarian Order of Merit, the Steiger Award (2006) and the St. George Order of the Semperoper (Dresden, 2010).

Honorary Medal of the city of Leipzig on the occasion of his Leukemia Fundraiser for 2009 on 17 December 2009; awarded by the Mayor of Leipzig (unanimous decision of the town council of Leipzig).

In 1993 he was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from Loughborough University.

On 23 February 2004, the Austrian Post Office issued a 1€ stamp to commemorate the 30th anniversary of his debut at the Vienna Staatsoper.

In 2004, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2009, he received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.

He has Honorary Doctorates from the University of Barcelona and Miguel Hernández University (Spain); Napier, Loughborough and Sheffield universities (United Kingdom); the Mendeleev Russian University of Chemistry and Technology (Russia); the University of Camerino (Italy); Rutgers University (United States); the University of Coimbra (Portugal); the National University of Music Bucharest (Romania); Philipps-Universität Marburg (Germany, 3 May 2006); University of Saarland (2012); the University of Pécs (Hungary) and most recently, Kyunghee University (Korea) and the University of Porto (Portugal).

In Spain the central plaza in Sant Joan d&#x27;Alacant bears his name, as do two theatres – the Auditori Josep Carreras in Vila-seca (near Tarragona) and The Teatro Josep Carreras in Fuenlabrada.

===Family===

Throughout his childhood in Barcelona, Carreras&#x27;s father, Josep Carreras i Soler, worked as a traffic policeman. He had originally been a French teacher. However, he had fought on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, and when the Franco government came into power in 1939, he was no longer allowed to teach. His mother, Antonia Coll i Saigi, ran a small hair-dressing salon, where, as a child, Carreras often sang to the customers in return for pocket money. He was very close to his mother, who was convinced that he would one day be a great singer, and her death from cancer when he was 18 affected him greatly. In &quot;José Carreras: A Life Story&quot;, he said that &quot;even now, every time I go on stage, I always, always, have a quick thought for her.&quot; In 1971 Carreras married Mercedes Pérez. They had two children: a son, Albert (born in 1972), and a daughter, Julia (born in 1978). The marriage ended in divorce in 1992. In 2006, Carreras married Jutta Jäger, but separated from her in 2011. Carreras&#x27;s nephew, David Giménez Carreras, is a conductor and Director of the Orquestra Simfònica del Vallès. He has conducted many of Carreras&#x27;s concerts since the late 1990s as well as his opera performances in &quot;Sly&quot; at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in June 2000.

==Voice==

In its prime, Carreras&#x27;s voice was considered one of the most beautiful tenor voices of the day. The Spanish critic, Fernando Fraga has described it as a lyric tenor with the generosity of a spinto, having &quot;a noble timbre, richly coloured and sumptuously resonant&quot;. This is particularly true of the middle range of his voice. Fraga also noted, as has Carreras himself, that even in his youth the high notes of the tenor range were always somewhat problematic for him, and became more so as his career progressed. Like his idol, Giuseppe di Stefano, Carreras was also known for the beauty and expressiveness of his phrasing and for his passionate delivery. These qualities are perhaps best exemplified in his 1976 recording of &quot;Tosca&quot; with Montserrat Caballé in the title role and conducted by Sir Colin Davis.

According to several critics his assumption of the heavier spinto roles such as &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;, Don José in &quot;Carmen&quot;, &quot;Don Carlo&quot;, and Alvaro in &quot;La forza del destino&quot; put a strain on his naturally lyric instrument which may have caused the voice to prematurely darken and lose some of its bloom. Nevertheless, he produced some of his finest performances in those roles.

The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote of his 1984 &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; at London&#x27;s Royal Opera House: &quot;Switching effortlessly from the lyric poet Rodolfo in &quot;La Bohème&quot; a few weeks ago to the heroic poet Chenier, the Spanish tenor&#x27;s vocal artistry held us spellbound throughout.&quot; Of his 1985 performance in &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; at La Scala (preserved on DVD), Carl Battaglia wrote in &quot;Opera News&quot; that Carreras dominated the opera &quot;with formidable concentration and a cleverly refined vocal accent that imparts to this spinto role an overlay of intensity lacking in his essentially lyric tenor.&quot; However, Carl H. Hiller&#x27;s review of the La Scala performance in &quot;Opera&quot; also noted that while in the quiet phrases of the score &quot;he could display all the tonal mellowness of which this perhaps most beautiful tenor voice of our time is capable&quot;, he had difficulty with the high loud notes, which sounded strained and uneasily produced.

<text>The April Theses (, transliteration: &quot;&quot;) were a series of ten directives issued by the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin upon his April 1917 return to Petrograd from his exile in Switzerland via Germany and Finland. The theses were mostly aimed at fellow Bolsheviks in Russia and returning to Russia from exile. He called for soviets (workers&#x27; councils) to seize state power (as seen in the slogan &quot;all power to the soviets&quot;), denounced liberals and social revolutionaries in the Provisional Government, called for Bolsheviks not to cooperate with the government, and called for new communist policies. The April Theses influenced the July Days and October Revolution in the next months and are identified with Leninism.

== Background ==
The February Revolution had resulted in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II, the collapse of Imperial Russia, and the establishment of the liberal Provisional Government under Georgy Lvov and later Alexander Kerensky. The Provisional Government was dominated mainly by liberals and moderate socialists who wanted to instigate political reform, creating a democracy with elections for an executive and a constituent assembly.

After the February Revolution, Lenin sought to return to Russia as soon as possible. This was problematic because he was isolated in neutral Switzerland as World War I continued to be fought in neighbouring states. The Swiss communist Fritz Platten managed to negotiate with the German government for the safe passage of Lenin and his company through Germany by rail on the so-called &quot;sealed train&quot;. The German government clearly hoped Lenin&#x27;s return would create political unrest in Russia, which would lead to the capitulation of Russia and the end of Russian participation of the war on the Entente side, ending the war on the Eastern Front and allowing German forces to concentrate their fight against France, Britain, and allied forces on the Western Front. (Indeed, after the October Revolution resulted in the Bolshevik rise to power, this did occur with the Decree on Peace and Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.)

Once through Germany, Lenin continued by ferry to Sweden, and the remainder of the journey through Scandinavia was subsequently arranged by Swedish communists Otto Grimlund and Ture Nerman. On 16 April (3 April according to the old Russian Calendar) 1917, Lenin arrived by train to a tumultuous reception at Finland Station in Petrograd.

== The Theses ==
The April Theses were first published in a speech in two meetings on 17 April 1917 (4 April according to the old Russian Calendar). Some believe he based this on Leon Trotsky&#x27;s Theory of Permanent Revolution. They were subsequently published in the Bolshevik newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot;. In the Theses, Lenin
#condemns the Provisional Government as bourgeois and urges &quot;no support&quot; for it, as &quot;the utter falsity of all its promises should be made clear&quot;. He condemns World War I as a &quot;predatory imperialist war&quot; and the &quot;revolutionary defensism&quot; of foreign social democrat parties, calling for revolutionary defeatism.
#asserts that Russia is &quot;passing from the first stage of the revolution—which, owing to the insufficient class consciousness and organization of the proletariat, placed power in the hands of the bourgeoisie—to its second stage, which must place power in the hands of the proletariat and the poorest sections of the peasants&quot;.
#recognises that the Bolsheviks are a minority in most of the soviets against a &quot;block of all the petty-bourgeois opportunist elements, from the Social-Cadets and the Socialist Revolutionaries down to the Organising Committee (Chkheidze, Tsereteli, etc.), Steklov, etc., etc., who have yielded to the influence of the bourgeoisie and spread that influence among the proletariat&quot;.
#calls for a parliamentary republic not to be established and calls this a &quot;retrograde step&quot;. He calls for &quot;a republic of Soviets of Workers&#x27;, Agricultural Labourers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Deputies throughout the country, from top to bottom&quot;. 
#calls for &quot;abolition of the police, the army, and the bureaucracy&quot; and for &quot;the salaries of all officials, all of whom are elective and displaceable at any time, not to exceed the average wage of a competent worker&quot;.
#calls for &quot;The weight of emphasis in the agrarian programme to be shifted to the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers&#x27; Deputies&quot;, &quot;confiscation of all landed estates&quot;, and &quot;nationalisation of all lands in the country, the land to be disposed of by the local Soviets of Agricultural Labourers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Deputies. The organisation of separate Soviets of Deputies of Poor Peasants. The setting up of a model farm on each of the large estates (ranging in size from 100 to 300 , according to local and other conditions, and to the decisions of the local bodies) under the control of the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers&#x27; Deputies and for the public account.&quot;
#calls for &quot;the immediate union of all banks in the country into a single national bank, and the institution of control over it by the Soviet of Workers&#x27; Deputies&quot;.
#states that &quot;it is not our immediate task to &#x27;introduce&#x27; socialism, but only to bring social production and the distribution of products at once under the control of the Soviets of Workers&#x27; Deputies&quot;.
#lists &quot;party tasks&quot; as &quot;Immediate convocation of a party congress&quot;, &quot;alteration of the party programme, mainly: (1) On the question of imperialism and the imperialist war, (2) On our attitude towards the state and our demand for a &#x27;commune state&#x27;, amendment of our out-of-date minimum programme, and change of the Party&#x27;s name&quot;. Lenin notes that &quot;instead of &#x27;Social Democracy&#x27;, whose official leaders throughout the world have betrayed socialism and deserted to the bourgeoisie (the &#x27;defencists&#x27; and the vacillating &#x27;Kautskyites&#x27;), we must call ourselves the Communist Party&quot;. The name change would dissociate the Bolsheviks from the social democratic parties of Europe supporting participation of their nation in World War I. Lenin first developed this point in his 1915 pamphlet &quot;Socialism and War&quot;, when he first called the pro-war social-democrats &quot;social chauvinists&quot;.
#calls for a new &quot;revolutionary International, an International against the social-chauvinists and against the &#x27;Center&#x27;&quot;. This later became the Communist International (Third International) which was formed in 1919.

== Effects ==
After the February Revolution, Bolshevik leaders returning from exile (such as Lev Kamenev) were arguing a much more moderate line, that Russian involvement in the war could be justified and that there should be cooperation with the liberals in the Provisional Government. However, Lenin&#x27;s arguments reflected those made by the leading Bolsheviks in Petrograd at the time of the February Revolution, such as Alexander Shlyapnikov. Joseph Stalin who had initially supported co operation with the Provisional Government changed his position upon reading the April Theses and spoke in favour of the programme at the Bolshevik city meeting in Petrograd.

After a heated discussion at the VII All-Russian Conference of the RSDLP(b) (April 24–29), with the participation of 133 delegates, the April Theses received the support of the majority of delegates from the field and formed the basis of the policy of the entire party.

<text>Ann Carolyn Telnaes (born November 15, 1960) is a prize-winning American editorial cartoonist. She creates editorial cartoons in various media—animation, visual essays, live sketches, and traditional print. Telnaes worked for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; from 2008 until her resignation on January 3, 2025. She also contributed to The Nib. Telnaes was honored with a solo exhibition at the Great Hall in the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress in 2004. Telnaes was president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists during 2016–2017. In 2020, her work was included in the exhibit &quot;Women in Comics: Looking Forward, Looking Back&quot; at the Society of Illustrators in New York City. She is a member of the advisory board of the Freedom Cartoonists Foundation that is based in Geneva and a former member of the board of directors of Cartoonists Rights Network International. 

== Biography ==
Ann Telnaes was born in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1960. She was graduated from Reno High School in Reno, Nevada in 1979. She is a naturalized citizen of the United States as well as a natal citizen of Sweden. 

Telnaes earned her B.F.A. at the California Institute of the Arts in 1985, specializing in character animation. In 2020, she taught the course &quot;Commentary Through Cartoons&quot; as a visiting faculty member at CalArts.

Before becoming an editorial cartoonist, she worked in the animation field and also as a show designer for Walt Disney Imagineering. She contributed to such films as &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot; and &quot;The Chipmunk Adventure&quot;.

In 2003, while the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was deciding the fate of same-sex marriage, Telnaes created an editorial cartoon criticizing the historical imbalance of gender roles in the United States by which &quot;the traditional view of marriage between a man and a woman has resulted in second class citizenship for many people in America for a long time&quot;. 

Telnaes began working for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2008. In 2015, a Telnaes cartoon was removed by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; from the newspaper&#x27;s website. The cartoon had depicted Ted Cruz as an organ grinder with two monkeys. Telnaes defended her cartoon by tweeting, &quot;Ted Cruz has put his children in a political ad—don&#x27;t start screaming when editorial cartoonists draw them as well.&quot; 

In early January 2025, Telnaes resigned from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; after her cartoon lampooning powerful media and technology billionaires and a corporation mascot performing obeisance before president-elect Donald Trump was rejected by opinions editor David Shipley. Included in the sketch were OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, &quot;Post&quot; owner Jeff Bezos, Meta/Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg offering bags of money, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; publisher Patrick Soon-Shiong, and a prostrate Disney mascot Mickey Mouse (representing Disney subsidiary ABC News). Mr. Shipley stated that his editorial decision was based on the piece&#x27;s redundancy with other content that had recently been published by or been approved for publication in the &quot;Post&quot;. His refusal to publish the cartoon was decried by the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists as &quot;craven censorship&quot; and &quot;political cowardice&quot;. Telnaes responded to the situation with a post to her online newsletter.

== Personal life ==
Telnaes lives with her husband, David Lloyd, in Washington, D.C.

== Awards ==
Telnaes is the second female cartoonist and one of the few freelancers to win the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning. She was the first woman to receive both the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning and the Reuben Award.

<text>Advanced Systems Format (formerly Advanced Streaming Format, Active Streaming Format) is Microsoft&#x27;s proprietary digital audio/digital video container format, especially meant for streaming media. ASF is part of the Media Foundation framework.

==Overview and features==
ASF is based on serialized &quot;objects&quot; which are essentially byte sequences identified by a GUID marker.

The format does not specify how (i.e. with which codec) the video or audio should be encoded; it just specifies the structure of the video/audio stream. This is similar to the function performed by the QuickTime File Format, AVI, or Ogg formats. One of the objectives of ASF was to support playback from digital media servers, HTTP servers, and local storage devices such as hard disk drives.

The most common media contained within an ASF file are Windows Media Audio (WMA) and Windows Media Video (WMV). The most common file extensions for ASF files are extension (audio-only files using Windows Media Audio, with MIME-type codice_1) and (files containing video, using the Windows Media Audio and Video codecs, with MIME-type codice_2). These files are identical to the old files but for their extension and MIME-type. The different extensions are used to make it easier to identify the content of a media file.

ASF files can also contain objects representing metadata, such as the artist, title, album and genre for an audio track, or the director of a video track, much like the ID3 tags of MP3 files. It supports scalable media types and stream prioritization; as such, it is a format optimized for streaming.

The ASF container provides the framework for digital rights management in Windows Media Audio and Windows Media Video. An analysis of an older scheme used in WMA reveals that it is using a combination of elliptic curve cryptography key exchange, DES block cipher, a custom block cipher, RC4 stream cipher and the SHA-1 hashing function.

ASF container-based media are sometimes still streamed on the internet either through the MMS protocol or the RTSP protocol. Mostly, however, they contain material encoded for &#x27;progressive download&#x27;, which can be distributed by any webserver and then offers the same advantages as streaming: the file starts playing as soon as a minimum number of bytes is received and the rest of the download continues in the background while one is watching or listening.

The Library of Congress Digital Preservation project considers ASF to be the &quot;de facto&quot; successor of RIFF. In 2010 Google picked RIFF as the container format for WebP.

==License==
The specification is downloadable from the Microsoft website, and the format can be implemented under a license from Microsoft that however does not allow distribution of sources and is not compatible with open source licenses. The author of the free software project VirtualDub reported that a Microsoft employee informed him that his software violated a Microsoft patent regarding ASF playback.

Certain error-correcting techniques related to ASF were patented in the United States (United States Patent 6,041,345 Levi, et al. March 21, 2000) by Microsoft until August 10, 2019.

<text>Lauterbrunnen () is a village and municipality in the Interlaken-Oberhasli administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. The municipality comprises the other villages of Wengen, Mürren, Gimmelwald, Stechelberg, and Isenfluh, as well as several other hamlets. The population of the village of Lauterbrunnen is less than that of Wengen, but larger than that of the others.

The municipality comprises the Lauterbrunnen Valley (), located at the foot of the Bernese Alps. It is notably overlooked by the Eiger, Mönch, Jungfrau and many other high peaks. The valley, drained by the White Lütschine, comprises the Soustal, the Sefinental and the upper Lauterbrunnen Valley with Untersteinberg. The valley includes several glaciers. Together with the adjacent valley of Grindelwald, the Lauterbrunnen Valley forms part of the Jungfrau Region of the Bernese Oberland, between Interlaken and the main crest of the Bernese Alps.

Similarly to Grindelwald, Lauterbrunnen has become a major tourist destination. It is connected to Interlaken by the Bernese Oberland Railway and is the start of the Wengernalp Railway, leading to Kleine Scheidegg. The latter resort is the start of the Jungfrau Railway, the highest railway in Europe and a gateway to the Jungfrau-Aletsch protected area.

==Toponymy==
Lauterbrunnen was first mentioned in 1240 as &quot;in claro fonte&quot;, a Romance language place name meaning &quot;clear spring&quot;. By 1253, it was known to German speakers as &quot;Liuterbrunnon&quot;; the town had an alternate spelling of &quot;Luterbrunnen&quot; by 1268. While the meaning of &quot;brunnen&quot; is undoubtedly spring or fountain, there is some dispute about the meaning of &quot;lauter&quot;. Some translate it as clear, clean or bright (which compares to the earlier Romance language meaning of the place mentioned above), while others translate it as &quot;many&quot; or &quot;louder&quot;. A local explanation is that the name Lauterbrunnen means &quot;many springs&quot;, using a modern meaning of the word &quot;lauter&quot; in German; however, this could be an example of a folk etymology.

==History==


The oldest trace of a settlement in the area is a single Roman coin which was discovered in the Blumental.

When the Lauterbrunnen Valley first appears in the historic record, during the 13th century, it was owned by the of Wädenswil. In 1240 the Freiherr of Wädenswil sold the Sefinen Valley to Interlaken Monastery. Over the following century, the monastery and other local lords began to expand their power in the Lauterbrunnen and neighboring valleys. However, around 1300, the Lord of Turn began to settle his Walser-speaking people in the nearby Lötschen Valley and into the highlands of the Lauterbrunnen Valley. By 1346, the Walser villages of Lauterbrunnen, Gimmelwald, Mürren, Sichellauenen and Trachsellauenen all had village governments and a certain amount of independence from the monastery. Three years later, much of the Bernese Oberland unsuccessfully rose up against monastery. When the monastery suppressed the rebellion, the Walser villages bore the brunt of the monastery&#x27;s wrath.

By the 15th century, the villages of the valley were part of the large parish of Gsteig bei Interlaken (now part of Gsteigwiler). Between 1487 and 1488, the villagers in Lauterbrunnen built a filial church of the parish. In 1506, the parish appointed a full-time priest for Lauterbrunnen. In 1528, the city of Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and began imposing it on the Bernese Oberland. Lauterbrunnen joined many other villages and the monastery in an unsuccessful rebellion against the new faith. After Bern imposed its will on the Oberland, they secularized the monastery and annexed all the monastery lands. Lauterbrunnen became the center of a new Reformed parish.

Mines were built in the Trachsellauenen area in the upper valley beginning in the late 16th century. An iron smelter was built in Zweilütschinen (now part of Gündlischwand) in 1715 to process the iron ore from Trachsellauenen. Most of the money from the mines went to the noble landowners, and the villagers remained poor. In the 17th and 18th centuries the poverty was so widespread that many of the villagers joined mercenary regiments or emigrated. Many emigrants moved to the Carolinas in the United States. 

Beginning in the late 18th century, foreign mountain climbers began to use Lauterbrunnen as a starting point for their expeditions into the nearby Alps. Initially the climbers stayed in the village rectory. However, as Lauterbrunnen&#x27;s fame grew and with the completion of a road from Interlaken in 1834 and the 1890 Bernese Oberland Railway, more hotels were needed for tourists. As new hotels were built, other tourist infrastructure was also built in the village. Cable cars were built to Mürren in 1891 and to Wengen in 1893. But the most significant piece of infrastructure was the Jungfrau railway, which was built in 1912. The Jungfrau rack railway runs from Kleine Scheidegg to the highest railway station in Europe at Jungfraujoch. The railway runs almost entirely within a tunnel built into the Eiger and Mönch mountains and contains two stations in the middle of the tunnel where passengers can disembark to observe the neighboring mountains through windows built into the mountainside. 

In 1909, the English brothers Walter and Arnold Lunn popularized skiing, curling and bobsledding at Lauterbrunnen. These winter sports provided a whole new group of winter tourists and converted the summer tourist industry into a year-round business. The tourist economy of Lauterbrunnen was devastated by World War I and II and the Great Depression. However, following the end of World War II, tourism rebounded. Many new vacation homes and chalets were built along with ski lifts, chair lifts and a heliport.

On 1 January 1973, the former municipality of Isenfluh merged into the municipality of Lauterbrunnen. On 31 December 2009, Amtsbezirk Interlaken, the municipality&#x27;s former district, was dissolved. On the following day, 1 January 2010, it joined the newly created Verwaltungskreis Interlaken-Oberhasli.

In May 2024, it was reported the local authority had initiated a working group to explore solutions for over-tourism, drawing inspiration from Venice&#x27;s trial entry fee for day trippers. One proposed measure is the introduction of a 5 to 10 Swiss franc entry fee, applicable to visitors arriving by car for the day, excluding those with pre-booked accommodations or arriving by public transport.

==Geography==

Lauterbrunnen lies at the bottom of a U-shaped valley that extends south and then south-westwards from the village to meet the Lauterbrunnen Wall. The Lauterbrunnen Valley (&quot;Lauterbrunnental&quot;) is one of the deepest in the Alpine chain when compared with the height of the mountains that rise directly on either side. It is a true cleft, rarely more than one kilometer in width, between limestone precipices, sometimes quite perpendicular and everywhere of extremely steep. In places the cliff walls are up to high. It is to this form that the valley owes the numerous waterfalls from which it derives its name. The streams descending from the adjoining mountains and, on reaching the verge of the rocky walls of the valley, form cascades so high that they are almost lost in spray before they reach the level of the valley. The most famous of these is Staubbach Falls, less than one kilometer from the village of Lauterbrunnen. The high Staubbach is the highest free-falling waterfall in Switzerland. Also near Lauterbrunnen is the highest waterfall in Switzerland, the Mürrenbach Fall. Finally, the Mattenbachfall (cascade waterfall) with a height of 930 meters is Europe&#x27;s highest waterfall and the third highest in the world.

The Weisse Lütschine river flows through Lauterbrunnen and overflows its banks about once a year. The source of the river comes from melting snow high in the mountains, thus making it a very pure and clean source of water. Trümmelbach Falls is from Lauterbrunnen, connected by bus from the station.

J. R. R. Tolkien hiked from Interlaken to the Lauterbrunnen Valley while on a trip to the Continent in 1911. The landscape of the valley later provided the concept and pictorial model for his sketches and watercolours of the fictitious valley of Rivendell, the dwelling place of Elrond Half-elven and his people.

Lauterbrunnen featured in several scenes from the 1969 James Bond film&quot; On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, including a car chase in which Bond (played for the only time by George Lazenby) was driven away from henchmen of Ernst Stavro Blofeld by his girlfriend Tracy di Vicenzo in a dramatic pursuit which culminated in them shaking off the pursuers in a stock car race. The 360 degree revolving restaurant Piz Gloria which crowns the Schilthorn peak was used to film Blofeld&#x27;s hideout. In the movie Bond escapes from it by skiing down the mountain to reach the village of Mürren at its base.

The location features in the Forza Motorsport series of games, with a fictional track by the name of &#x27;Bernese Alps&#x27; incorporated into the mountainside.

<text>Dschinghis Khan (; &quot;Genghis Khan&quot;) is a German Eurodisco pop band. It was originally formed in Munich in 1979 to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest with their song &quot;Dschinghis Khan&quot;.

The original group consisted of six members: Louis Hendrik Potgieter, Edina Pop, Henriette Strobel, Wolfgang Heichel, Leslie Mándoki, and Steve Bender, performed from 1979 to their first disbandment in 1985.

In 2005, the surviving Dschinghis Khan members reunited to recreate the music group that had been broken up, but years later they separately organized different bands all under the brand name &quot;Dschinghis Khan&quot;.

== History ==
===Beginning: 1979–1985===
Dschinghis Khan was managed by German producer Ralph Siegel and choreographed by Hannes Winkler, one of the most famous German choreographers during that time. Their original eponymous song was written and produced by Siegel with lyrics by Bernd Meinunger and came in fourth place at the Eurovision Song Contest 1979 in Jerusalem. Their name is one of several possible German spellings (the most common is &quot;Dschingis Khan&quot;) of the name of the historical figure Genghis Khan of the Mongol Empire. The only native Germans in the group were the bald-headed Karl-Heinz &quot;Steve&quot; Bender and Wolfgang Heichel, who brought his Dutch-born wife Henriette ( Strobel) with him. Louis Hendrik Potgieter (Genghis Khan) was South African. Edina Pop (Marika Késmárky) was a Hungarian who had started her singing career in West Germany in 1969. Leslie Mándoki, also Hungarian, had left Hungary in 1975.

In 1979, the group released the singles &quot;Dschinghis Khan&quot; and &quot;Moskau&quot;. A year later, the English version of &quot;Moskau&quot; topped the charts in Australia for six weeks, largely thanks to Seven Network using the song as the theme music for coverage of the 1980 Summer Olympics. In an interview with Russian television presenter Alexandra Glotova, the producer of the group Dschinghis Khan, Heinz Gross, said that in the 1980s, the group was banned in the Soviet Union and was accused of anti-communism and nationalism.

Following the success of the singles &quot;Hadschi Halef Omar&quot;, &quot;Rom&quot;, &quot;Pistolero&quot;, and &quot;Loreley&quot;, Dschinghis Khan underwent an image change, with their songs becoming more folk-oriented with their fourth album, &quot;Helden, Schurken &amp; der Dudelmoser&quot;. As a result, their popularity waned. The group released their fifth album, &quot;Corrida&quot;, which served as the soundtrack to the musical of the same name by Siegel and Meinunger. After the release of the single &quot;Mexico&quot;, Dschinghis Khan disbanded in 1985.

===Post-disbandment: 1985–1994===

Following Dschinghis Khan&#x27;s disbandment, the members took different paths. Mándoki became a successful musician and producer while Pop pursued a solo singing career and Bender worked as a music producer. The success of the band eventually led to Wolfgang and Henriette&#x27;s divorce in 1986, with Henriette reverting to her maiden name of Strobel.

In 1986, the group reunited as &quot;Dschinghis Khan Family&quot;, but only with original members Strobel on vocals, Mándoki on drums, and Potgieter on keyboards. The song &quot;Wir gehör&#x27;n zusammen&quot; led them to a national qualifying round of the Eurovision Song Contest, where they finished in second place.

In 1994, Potgieter died of AIDS in South Africa.

===Reunion: 2005–2018===
On 17 December 2005, Dschinghis Khan reunited at the Retro FM Festival in Moscow, with founding members Bender, Pop, Heichel, and Strobel joined by new members Stefan Track, Kaya Ebru, and Daniel Käsling. In May 2006, Bender died of cancer. The song &quot;Wie Feuer im Wind&quot; on the group&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;7 Leben&quot; was dedicated to both Potgieter and Bender.

In 2006, Track left the group and started his own solo project called Rocking Son. On July 15, Strobel, Heichel, and Pop were joined by the dance group The Legacy of Dschinghis Khan in a concert in Mongolia. The dance group consisted of Claus Kupreit, Corinna Günzel, Benjamin Schobel, Evi Weigand, Stefan Sauter, and Angelika Nimbach; Kurpreit would go on to become a permanent member of Dschinghis Khan. In 2014, Heichel left the group due to creative differences.

===Recent developments: 2018–present===
In 2018, Dschinghis Khan re-recorded &quot;Moskau&quot; with new lyrics for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which was hosted in Russia. For the German and English versions, the lead vocals were performed by former US5 member Jay Khan. Alexander Malinin and his daughter Ustinya performed the Russian version, titled &quot;Moskva&quot;. The Spanish version, titled &quot;Moscú&quot;, was performed by Jorge Jiménez and Marifer Medrano. At the same time, Heichel teamed up with Track to record the song &quot;We Love Football&quot;. It was revealed that Heichel gained the rights to the Dschinghis Khan name in Germany and Spain. Strobel, Pop, Kupreit, and producer Heinz Gross also own the rights to the name Dschinghis Khan, with both group patents revealing the use of their own logos. As a result, there are two disco groups operating under the name Dschinghis Khan.

On 12 September 2020, dancer and singer Johannes Kupreit died in a car accident in Germany. Tributes were paid from the members and Dschinghis Khan fans from around the world. By the end of 2020, Pop and Strobel retired from their band. Meanwhile, the Heichel and Track faction of Dschinghis Khan released the studio album &quot;Here We Go&quot;, which is a mix of new songs and self-covers.

In July 2021, Siegel sued Heichel when the latter attempted to bar him from releasing the 2018 FIFA World Cup version of &quot;Moskau&quot; and claimed to have full ownership of the Dschinghis Khan name. The Munich Regional Court ruled in favor of Siegel and awarded him the trademark rights to the group, citing him as the group&#x27;s original creator and producer and the group&#x27;s prior disbandments did not affect his ownership rights.

In January 2022, Wolfgang Heichel posted a statement on his Facebook in regards to his split from Stefan Track&#x27;s iteration of Dschinghis Khan, due to serious creative differences and the claim that Track&#x27;s &quot;Dschinghis Khan&quot; account falsely claims to be the original Dschinghis Khan.

In 2023, the Siegel lineup was revamped with three new members: Marco Matias, Selina Kohl, and Michael Thurner.

<text>The Workers&#x27; Opposition () was a faction of the Russian Communist Party that emerged in 1920 as a response to the perceived over-bureaucratisation that was occurring in Soviet Russia. They advocated for the transfer of national economic management to trade unions. The group was led by Alexander Shlyapnikov, Sergei Medvedev, Alexandra Kollontai and Yuri Lutovinov. It officially existed until March 1921 when it was forced to dissolve by the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and semi-clandestinely until the subsequent 11th Congress in 1922, where its main exponents teetered dangerously on the verge of being purged for fractionist activity. In some aspects, it was close with the German council communist movement, although there is no information about direct contacts between these groups.

==History==
=== Emergence ===
The emergence of the Workers&#x27; Opposition&#x27;s “ideological sources” was linked with a statement by Alexander Shlyapnikov, which appeared on November 4, 1917: in his statement, Shlyapnikov proposed expanding the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars by including representatives “from all Soviet parties”. Their first public appearance as an organized group was at the 9th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), in September 1920, when the faction not only declared its existence, but also summed up the “work to be done”.

=== First appearances ===

One of the first speeches of representatives of the &quot;workers&#x27; opposition&quot; - the name was coined by Lenin - took place in February 1920, during the 2nd Tula Conference of the RCP (B.), after which the group managed to get a majority of seats in the provincial committee of the party, and its leader - I. V. Kopylov - became the chairman of the new composition of the provincial committee. In response to this, the former members of the provincial committee formed the opposition, directing their activities to prove the inability the &quot;workers&#x27; opposition&quot; to manage the affairs of the province; in addition, they began to plan the failure of their political opponents at the next provincial party conference. This confrontation led to an intensification of the struggle within the organization itself: the party&#x27;s Novosilsky District committee opposed the election of Kopylov and called for an extraordinary conference. The demand of the old guard was supported in Moscow by members of the party&#x27;s central committee, who recalled Kopylov at their disposal. The conflict did not end there, because in response, the Zarechensky district committee issued a resolution requesting &quot;to leave Kopylov to work in Tula.&quot; The Central Committee nevertheless decided to convene an extraordinary party conference in the province: a resolution evaluating the work as unsatisfactory was adopted by a majority of 185 votes against 49. In response, representatives of the “workers&#x27; opposition” Severny and Nikitin left the district committee because of their disagreement with the party line. Having been defeated in Tula, Kopylov&#x27;s supporters nevertheless retained their positions in the Zarechensky district organization and the power struggle continued. At that time, support for the workers&#x27; opposition in the lower ranks of the party was quite strong: in particular, the number of Tula party organizations was halved between May and November 1920, mainly due to the exit of the local workers.

From the end of 1919 to the beginning of 1920, the workers&#x27; opposition matured along the periphery of Moscow Oblast and, by March 1920, took shape in the capital with many trade union leaders joining the group. In the same month, at a meeting of the communist faction of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, Shlyapnikov proposed a formula for the separation of powers in the USSR: his simple scheme consisted in the separation of functions of trade unions, Soviets, and the Bolshevik party. According to the leader of the opposition, the party could be the responsible political state leader of the revolutionary struggle and construction, the Soviets - the form of political power, and the trade unions - the only responsible organizations of the national economy and, at the same time, the school of industrial management for workers.

Shlyapnikov&#x27;s theses caused great concern within the Central Committee of the RCP (b), which saw in them the manifestation of tendencies toward syndicalism in the Soviet trade unions - that is, an attempt on the leading role of the party in the economic sphere. On March 8 and 10, 1920, at meetings of the VTsSPS and MGPSS factions, representatives of the Central Committee Nikolai Bukharin and Nikolay Krestinsky sharply criticized Shlyapnikov&#x27;s ideas, accusing him of “syndicalism, guild narrowness, distrust of the Soviets and the party.” In response to such accusations, Lozovsky, who attended the meetings, noted that syndicalists denied the state itself, and Shlyapnikov had a different point of view: the opposition leader did not deny the state and did not encroach on state property; he talked only about the responsibility of trade unions for the economy and the main role of unions in Soviet industry.

In September 1920, at the 9th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), there was a new flash of activity of supporters of the workers&#x27; opposition, which was associated with a discussion about the upper and lower classes of the party. Yuri Lutovinov formulated a number of provisions that later became part of the group&#x27;s opposition program: in his speech he “fervently insisted on the immediate implementation of the broadest possible labor democracy, on the complete abolition of appointment, and on the strictest cleansing of the party.” The Bolshevik conference did not support this proposal: moreover, at the meeting it was decided to create a control commission, whose task was to prevent the factional struggle in the party. Despite such measures, the speeches of the supporters of the workers&#x27; opposition became more frequent throughout the country, and its contradictions with the course of the Central Committee intensified both in the regions and in the center. In particular, in November 1920, the Organizing Bureau of the Central Committee of the RCP (B.) was forced to pay special attention to the conflict in the Tula Provincial Committee of the RCP (B.), which flared up with renewed vigor: to clarify the circumstances, the central committee sent a special commission to the province. At the same time, in Moscow itself, the internal party struggle took on a fierce character. In the fall of 1920, playing on the problem of the upper and lower classes, the workers&#x27; opposition were able to attract the sympathy of many Bolsheviks to their program and form tangible support for their ideas among the party workers. As a result, at the end of November, at the gubernatorial conference, the opposition bloc was able to collect almost half of the delegates&#x27; votes: 124 against 154 people. As indicated in the Central Committee&#x27;s report, &quot;the opposition itself was extremely hostile to the common party line&quot;: subsequently, Lenin noted that it came to the point that &quot;the conference ended in two rooms&quot;.

===Trade-union debate===

====Start of the debate====
The &quot;trade-union debate&quot; marked the rise of the &quot;workers&#x27; opposition.&quot; Relying on the provisions contained in the party program adopted at the 8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1919 - primarily on the part that “trade unions should come to the total concentration of control over the entire national economy&quot; - Shlyapnikov criticized the central committee with his like-minded comrades for “militaristic methods” of working with trade unions, specifically because during the Russian Civil War, unions were massively deprived of independence and absorbed by the government of the RSFSR.

According to Aleksei Semyonovich Kiselyov, serious disagreements with the party leadership among the trade union leaders emerged at the beginning of 1920: he saw them as the main reason for the transition to a policy of militarization of labor. At that time, the majority of trade unions believed that the prospect of the end of active hostilities required, if not a change in policy guidelines, then at least a shift in emphasis in the organization of labor - a transition to economic incentives. In particular, they advocated the improvement of the food situation of the proletariat and the development of &quot;amateur activity&quot; of workers within the framework of trade union organizations. Moreover, the party leadership proceeded from the assumption that in the prevailing conditions at the time of the end of the long war, reliance on conventional methods of industrial management would not be able to prevent the final collapse of the Soviet economy: they believed that emergency measures, including military ones, were necessary.

====Positions of the parties====
Questions about trade unions became key at meetings of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions on March 8, 10 and 15, 1920. According to Kiselyov, by that time in the leading circles of trade union leaders, three political groups could be identified. The first could be attributed to David Riazanov and Mikhail Tomsky, who believed that trade unions should withdraw from economic affairs and deal primarily with the organization of labor. The second group included those workers who advocated the “merging” of trade unions with the state apparatus. And the third group consisted of Shlyapnikov&#x27;s supporters, who believed that trade unions should become the sole responsible organizations in the field of the national economy of the RSFSR. Thus, already in the spring of 1920, a heated discussion about trade unions began in Soviet Russia: it became open only in late 1920 - early 1921. At that time, a five-member “trade union commission” was created for the central committees, the tasks of which included both studying and verifying the practical experience of the trade unions, and developing abstracts that would express the Central Committee&#x27;s point of view on this issue. However, Alexander Shlyapnikov, Yury Lutovinov and Leon Trotsky, initially included in this commission, refused to participate in it - which only aggravated the differences. Under these conditions, on December 24, the Plenum of the Central Committee decided to open a broad discussion on the question of trade unions.

On December 30, 1920, leaders of intra-party groups spoke at an expanded meeting of the communist faction of the 8th All-Russian Congress of Soviets and All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, where they outlined their political platforms. The controversy unfolding at the meeting was accompanied by mutual accusations and almost immediately &quot;acquired a bad character.&quot; From the beginning of January of the following year, party organizations joined in the discussion of issues: in particular, on January 3, at a meeting of the party&#x27;s active in Petrograd, an “Appeal to the Party” was adopted, expressing full support for the Lenin-Zinoviev group, and Trotsky was accused of trying to split the party and professional movement, &quot;in the desire to eliminate unions&quot;. At the same time, the resolution proposed to send representatives to the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in proportion to the number of votes cast in support of each group. In addition, a desire was expressed to send agitators to the province who were obliged to provide propaganda and organizational assistance to local supporters of the Leninist group.

==== Support for the “Workers&#x27; Opposition” Platform====
Almost from the very beginning, the discussion on trade unions went beyond the usual discussion of the theses of various fractions - and &quot;turned into a kind of formal revealing of party opinion.&quot; The question of the future of trade unions was brought up for discussion in district committees and district meetings of the Bolsheviks: usually, after reports of representatives of various platforms, voting was held at meetings. On the whole, the majority of Soviet communists supported the Leninist position; in particular, on January 17, 1921, eight platforms were put to a vote at a meeting of the party&#x27;s Moscow committee: 76 people voted for Lenin&#x27;s wording, 27 for Trotsky&#x27;s ideas, 4 for the theses of the “workers&#x27; opposition”, 11 for the Group of Democratic Centralism (who wanted more Soviet autonomy), 25 for the group of Ignatians, and the remaining platforms received less than two votes. On January 25, in the Tula party organization - where Trotsky, Zinoviev and Shlyapnikov acted as rapporteurs - 582 people voted for Lenin-Zinoviev&#x27;s resolution, 272 for Trotsky&#x27;s and 16 delegates for Shlyapnikov&#x27;s. The Petrograd party organization also supported the Leninist &quot;Platform 10&quot; and it gradually became apparent that the struggle in the capital was waged between the groups of Lenin—Zinoviev and Trotsky.

A more &quot;motley&quot; picture was observed at the county and district meetings: on January 27, in the second Zamoskvoretsky district, 59 votes were cast for &quot;platform 10&quot;, 10 for the theses of the &quot;workers&#x27; opposition&quot;, and seven people supported the Trotskyists; in another district of Moscow - Baumansky - in the central area, 43 people voted for Lenin&#x27;s thesis, 7 for the &quot;workers&#x27; opposition&quot;, and 4 people for Trotsky&#x27;s principles. The trade unions themselves did not go around the discussion: in particular, at the congress of miners in Moscow, the platform of the &quot;workers&#x27; opposition&quot; gathered 61 votes in support, the &quot;platform 10&quot; - 137, and only eight people supported Trotsky&#x27;s theses.

At the Moscow Provincial Party Conference, held on February 19, 1921, and attended by more than three hundred delegates, there was a scandal: E. N. Ignatov declared support for the platform of the “workers&#x27; opposition”, which “caused great concern” among the conference members, since until the last day Ignatov&#x27;s group supported “platform 10”. The subsequent vote ended with the following result: “platform 10” received 217 votes, Trotsky&#x27;s theses - 52, the platform of “workers&#x27; opposition” - 45, and the principles of “democratic centralism” - 13 votes. In the central committee of metalworkers, the “workers&#x27; opposition” generally took first place: they were given eleven out of twenty votes.

====10th Congress====

At the final stage of the &quot;trade-union debate&quot; of the Soviet Communists, to a large extent, the fate of the trade unions was no longer a cause for concern - the question of which fraction would win the upcoming 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) became more important. As a result, the struggle of the factions escalated into a battle for leadership in the party - which significantly affected the course of the discussion. In the event, the congress passed a secret resolution &quot;On Party Unity&quot; which banned factions within the party and ordered the immediate dissolution of the groups that had been previously formed. The resolution put an end to the aspirations of the Workers&#x27; Opposition and the Democratic Centralists.

Another secret resolution specially aimed at the Workers&#x27; Opposition was also passed condemning &#x27;the syndicalist and anarchist deviation in our party&#x27;, which &quot;made further advocacy of the basic tenets of the Workers&#x27; Opposition&#x27;s programme impossible&quot;. Yet the Congress shared some of its peripheral proposals, including conducting a purge of the Party and organizing better supply of workers, to improve workers&#x27; living conditions, and three of its leaders were elected to the Party Central Committee: Shlyapnikov as a full voting member, Medvedev and Kiselyov as candidate members. Nevertheless, Party leaders subsequently undertook a campaign to subordinate trade unions to the Party and to harass and intimidate those who opposed this campaign.

===End of the movement===

Members of the former Workers&#x27; Opposition continued to advocate their views during the period of the New Economic Policy but increasingly became politically . Nonetheless, on 5 July 1921 Kollontai took the floor before the Third Congress of the Comintern, bitterly attacking the policies of the Soviet government and warning that NEP &#x27;threatened to disillusion workers, to strengthen the peasantry and petty bourgeoisie, and to facilitate the rebirth of capitalism&#x27;.

Shlyapnikov and his supporters also conducted discussions with Gavril Myasnikov&#x27;s Workers Group, but unlike Myasnikov, were determined not to leave the ranks of the Communist Party. At the beginning of 1922, former exponents of the Workers&#x27; Opposition, such as Shlyapnikov and Medvedev, and other members of the party of working class origins signed the so-called &quot;Letter of the Twenty Two&quot;, appealing to the Comintern Executive against suppression of dissent within the Russian party and bourgeois infiltrations into the Soviet state and the party itself. Kollontai co-signed the letter, with her best friend Zoya Shadurskaia, as intellectuals of non-working-class extraction, but in February 1922 she was restrained by Trotsky and Zinoviev from speaking before the Comintern Executive on behalf of the views expressed in the appeal. Shlyapnikov, Kollontai, and Sergei Medvedev narrowly escaped expulsion from the Russian Communist Party at the party&#x27;s subsequent Eleventh Congress in 1922, while two other signatories of the appeal, Flor Anisimovich Mitin (1882–1937) and Nikolái Vladimirovich Kuznetsov (1898–1937), were expelled. Kollontai later became an important diplomat and Shlyapnikov wrote memoirs.

In the latter half of the 1930s, Shlyapnikov and his closest comrades (Kollontai was not among them) were charged with involvement in a counterrevolutionary group called &quot;Workers&#x27; Opposition&quot; and with having linked up with the &quot;counterrevolutionary Trotskyist–Zinovievist terrorist bloc&quot;. Despite their proclaiming themselves innocent, both Shlyapnikov and Medvedev, along with many others, were condemned to death and executed in September 1937. In her biography of Shlyapnikov Barbara Allen concludes the last chapter before epilogue, with these words:
After the end of Stalinism, Shlyapnikov was rehabilitated in 1963, Medvedev in 1977. The decision annulling the latter&#x27;s case for lack of evidence emphasized that &quot;None of those judged on the Workers&#x27; Opposition case confessed guilt&quot;.

==Membership==

The Workers&#x27; Opposition was led by Alexander Shlyapnikov, who was also chairman of the Russian Metalworkers&#x27; Union, and it consisted of trade union leaders and industrial administrators who had formerly been industrial workers. Alexandra Kollontai, the famous socialist feminist, was the group&#x27;s mentor and advocate. Other prominent members included Sergei Medvedev and Mikhail Vladimirov (leaders of the Metalworkers&#x27; Union), and Genrikh Bruno (artilleries industry leaders), Mikhail Chelyshev (a member of the Party Control Commission), (chairman of the Textileworkers&#x27; Union), Kirill Orlov (member of the Council of Military Industry and a participant in the 1905 mutiny on the Russian battleship Potemkin), and Aleksei Kiselyov (chairman of the Miners&#x27; Union). Yuri Lutovinov, a leader of the Metalworkers&#x27; Union and of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, sometimes spoke for the group, but sometimes held his own opinion.

==Ideology==
The Workers&#x27; Opposition advocated the role of unionized workers in directing the economy at a time when Soviet government organs were running industry by and trying to exclude trade unions from a participatory role. Specifically, the Workers&#x27; Opposition demanded that unionized workers (blue and white collar) should elect representatives to a vertical of councils that would oversee the economy. At all levels, elected leaders would be responsible to those who had elected them and could be removed from below. The Workers&#x27; Opposition demanded that Russian Communist Party secretaries at all levels cease petty interference in the operations of trade unions and that trade unions should be reinforced with staff and supplies to allow them to carry out their work effectively. Leaders of the Workers&#x27; Opposition were not opposed to the employment of &quot; specialists&quot; in the economy, but did oppose giving such individuals strong administrative powers, unchecked from below. The &quot;Workers&#x27; Opposition&quot; based their ideas on the experience of the first months of Soviet power - a short period when the organization of production was really carried out on the basis of the self-government of the proletarians.

<doc id="290584" wikidata="Q1632769" url="?curid=290584" title="Charles Forte, Baron Forte">
<text>Charles Carmine Forte, Baron Forte (26 November 1908 – 28 February 2007) was an Italian-born Scottish hotelier who founded the leisure and hotels conglomerate that ultimately became the Forte Group.

==Early life==
Charles Forte was born as Carmine Forte in Mortale, now Monforte, Casalattico, in the province of Frosinone, Italy on 26 November 1908, eldest son of Rocco Giovanni Forte and Maria Luigia, daughter of Michelangelo Antonio Forte. His parents were distantly related. He emigrated from Italy to Scotland at the age of four with his family.

He attended Alloa Academy and then St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Dumfries, as a boarder, followed by two years of studies in Rome.

==Early career==

After Rome, Forte rejoined his family, who had moved to Weston-super-Mare, where his father ran a café with two cousins. Charles&#x27; main training at the age of 21 came in Brighton, where he managed the Venetian.

At 26, he set up his first &quot;milk bar&quot; in 1935, the Strand Milk Bar Ltd. Soon he began expanding into catering and hotel businesses. At the outbreak of World War II, Forte was interned in the Isle of Man due to his Italian nationality, but he was released after only three months. After the war, his company became Forte Holdings Ltd and bought the Café Royal in 1954.

In the 1950s, he also opened the first catering facility at Heathrow Airport and the first full motorway service station in the UK for cars at Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on the M1 motorway in 1959. He purchased the Hungaria Restaurant in Lower Regent St. in 1955.

==Later career==

Trust Houses Group Ltd and Forte Holdings were merged in 1970 to become Trust House Forte or THF. Through mergers and expansion, Forte expanded the Forte Group into a multibillion-pound business. His empire included the Little Chef and Happy Eater roadside restaurants, Crest, Forte Grand, Travelodge and Posthouse hotels, as well as the wine merchant Grierson-Blumenthal and a non-controlling majority stake in the Savoy Hotel.

The Grierson-Blumenthal stake became a legally &quot;forced&quot; acquisition by the group. It had been a personal holding of Charles Forte and fellow directors of the group, supplying liquor to Forte restaurants and hotels at substantial personal profit, until the prejudice to shareholders was realised in the late 1970s (including possible prosecution under the Companies Act) which obliged its acquisition as a subsidiary.

Forte was the CEO from 1971 and chairman from 1982 (when his son Rocco took over as CEO) of the Group. Happy Eater and the five Welcome Break major road service outlets were bought from Hanson Trust PLC on 1 August 1986. In the 1990s, the company increased its nominal capital and agreed to the public listed companies compliance regime to become Forte Group plc.

Lord Forte passed full control to his son Rocco in 1993, but soon the plc was faced with a hostile takeover bid from Granada. Ultimately, Granada succeeded with a £3.9 billion tender offer in January 1996, which left the family with about £350 million in cash.

On 28 February 2007, Forte died in his sleep at his home in London, aged 98. He is buried in West Hampstead Cemetery.

==Honours and awards==
Forte was knighted by The Queen Mother in 1970 and created a life peer on 2 February 1982 as Baron Forte, of Ripley in the County of Surrey. He was also a knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.
==Family==
In January 1943, Forte married Irene Mary, daughter of Giovanni Chierico, of Venice; her family ran a delicatessen on Wardour Street, Soho. Lady Forte had been apprenticed to a Mayfair couturier, where she learned sewing and gained an appreciation of quality materials. After her father&#x27;s death when she was 17, she ran the family shop for three months whilst her mother was in Italy; it was destroyed by a bomb during the Blitz in 1940. 

From the 1950s, Forte lived with an extended family including his parents and children at Greenway Gardens in Frognal, Hampstead, London. They attended services at the Roman Catholic St. Mary&#x27;s Church in nearby Holly Lane, Hampstead.

Together, they had six children, five girls and a boy:
* The Hon. Sir Rocco John Vincent Forte (b. 1945), who was knighted in 1995. On 15 February 1986, he married Aliai Giovanna Maria Ricci in Rome. They have three children.
* The Hon. Olga Forte CBE (b. 1947), who was married firstly to the late Count Alessandro Polizzi and secondly, in 1993, to The Hon. William Shawcross. Olga had two children with Alessandro:
** Alexandra Polizzi, a hotelier and the presenter of Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;The Hotel Inspector&quot;
**Charlotte Polizzi (b.1973), who married TV celebrity Oliver Peyton 
* The Hon. Marie Louise Forte (b. 1950), who married Robert Alexander Burness and had two children.
* The Hon. Irene Forte (b. 1956), who married US Ambassador John Danilovich and had three children.
* The Hon. Giancarla Forte (b. 1959), who married Michael Ulic Anthony Alen-Buckley and had two children. 

Irene, Lady Forte died 12 September 2010, and she is buried with her husband.

Lord Forte&#x27;s family came from Mortale (later renamed Monforte in his honour), in the Lazio region of Central Italy, where he retained the family home.

<text>Severus of Antioch (; ), also known as Severus of Gaza, or the Crown of Syrians (; ), was the Patriarch of Antioch and head of the Syriac Orthodox Church from 512 until his death in 538. He is venerated as a saint in the Oriental Orthodox Church, and his feast day is 8 February.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Severus was born in the city of Sozopolis in Pisidia in 459, or , into an affluent Christian family, however, later Miaphysite sources would assert that his parents were pagan. His father was a senator in the city, and his paternal grandfather, also named Severus, was the Bishop of Sozopolis and had attended the Council of Ephesus in 431. According to Severus&#x27; hagiography, he was named after his paternal grandfather as he had received a vision in which he was told, &quot;the child who is for your son will strengthen Orthodoxy, and his name will be after your name&quot;.

After his father&#x27;s death, in 485, Severus travelled to Alexandria in Egypt to study grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy, in both Greek and Latin. At Alexandria, he met Zacharias of Mytilene, a fellow student and friend, who persuaded him to read the works of Gregory of Nazianzus, and Basil of Caesarea, in particular his correspondence with Libanius. According to Zacharias, whilst students at Alexandria, he and Severus discovered and destroyed a hoard of pagan idols at the neighbouring city of Menouthis.

In the autumn of 486, Severus travelled to Berytus in Phoenicia and studied law and philosophy at the law school, where he was later joined by Zacharias in 487. At Berytus, Severus and Zacharias led the expulsion of necromancers and enchanters from the city, and Severus began to dedicate his free time to studying the works of the Fathers of the Church. At this time, he joined a group of students led by a certain Evagrius who prayed together at the Church of the Resurrection every evening. Severus was convinced to be baptised, as he had not yet undergone baptism due to Pisidian custom in which men could not be baptised until they had grown a beard. In 488, he was baptised at the Church of Saint Leontius at Tripolis with Evagrius as his sponsor.

===Monkhood===
Severus subsequently adopted an ascetic life whereby he rejected bathing and adopted fasting. He initially intended to return to Pisidia and practise law, however, after a pilgrimage to the Church of Saint Leontius in Tripolis, the head of John the Baptist at Emesa, and Jerusalem, he resolved to join Evagrius and become a monk. Severus entered the monastery of Peter the Iberian near Maiuma in Palestine, a prominent centre of non-Chalcedonianism, and remained there for several years. He later joined a monastic brotherhood in the desert near Eleutheropolis under the archimandrite Mamas. Severus practised asceticism in the desert until c. 500, at which time he became ill and was convinced to recover at the Monastery of Saint Romanus in Maiuma, where he was ordained a priest by Epiphanius, Bishop of Magydus. At Maiuma, Severus received his inheritance from his parents; he shared the property with his brothers, donated most of his share to the poor, and constructed a monastery.

On a walk outside the city, Severus came upon a hermit who left his cave to call out, &quot;welcome to you Severus, teacher of Orthodoxy, and Patriarch of Antioch&quot;, despite never meeting Severus, the hermit thus prophesied Severus&#x27; ascension to the patriarchal throne. He remained at his monastery until 507/508, at which time Nephalius, a Chalcedonian monk, arrived at Maiuma and preached against Severus and other non-Chalcedonians. In 508, Nephalius wrote an &quot;apologia&quot; of the Council of Chalcedon, to which Severus replied in his two &quot;Orationes ad Nephalium&quot;. In the same year, Patriarch Elias I of Jerusalem commissioned Nephalius to expel non-Chalcedonian monks from their monasteries in Palestine, and Severus was sent to Constantinople to complain to Emperor Anastasius I.

Severus travelled to Constantinople alongside 200 non-Chalcedonian monks, and gained favour with the emperor soon after his arrival. Patriarch Macedonius II of Constantinople attempted to sway Anastasius to support the Council of Chalcedon and presented the emperor with a collection of edited excerpts from the works of Cyril of Alexandria, an important Father of the Church who had died prior to the council. Severus, however, wrote &quot;Philalethes&quot;, and refuted Macedonius as the work of Cyril presented to the emperor was shown to be taken out of context. At Constantinople, Severus became friends with Julian, Bishop of Halicarnassus. Under Severus&#x27; influence, in 510, Anastasius allowed non-Chalcedonians to retake their monasteries, and, in 510/511, the emperor issued a &quot;typos&quot; (edict) that adopted the non-Chalcedonian interpretation of the &quot;Henotikon&quot; as law. After Macedonius&#x27; deposition and his succession by Timothy I of Constantinople, a non-Chalcedonian, in August 511, Severus returned to his monastery in Palestine.

===Patriarch of Antioch===
In 512, Flavian II, Patriarch of Antioch, was deposed by Anastasius, and a synod was held at Laodicea in Syria to elect a successor. Severus was elected on 6 November and consecrated at the Great Church of Antioch on 16 November. The consecration ceremony was attended by the bishops Dionysius of Tarsus, Nicias of Laodicea, Philoxenus of Mabbug, Peter of Beroea, Simeon of Chalcis, Marion of Sura, Eusebius of Gabbula, Silvanus of Urima, Sergius of Cyrrhus, John of Europus, Philoxenus of Doliche, and Iulianus of Salamias. During the consecration ceremony, he affirmed the councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, and Ephesus, and the &quot;Henotikon&quot;. Despite orders from Anastasius to not act or speak against the Council of Chalcedon, Severus condemned the council, as well as Pope Leo&#x27;s Tome, Nestorius, Eutyches, Diodorus of Tarsus, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Ibas of Edessa, Barsauma, and Cyrus and John of Aigai. However, Severus could not be heard due to shouting and commotion, and he signed a declaration of faith at the ceremony&#x27;s conclusion.

Upon his consecration, Severus had the baths at the patriarchal palace destroyed and the cooks sent away, in keeping with his abstinence from luxurious bathing and eating. He was accepted as Patriarch of Antioch by Patriarch Timothy I of Constantinople and Pope John II (III) of Alexandria, but Patriarch Elias I of Jerusalem and other bishops refused to acknowledge him. Couriers taking synodical letters from Severus to Jerusalem were expelled from the city by Sabbas the Sanctified and a crowd congregated at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and chanted, &quot;anathema to Severus and his fellow communicants&quot;. Within Syria, Severus was popular amongst the population of the province of Syria Prima, which had largely adopted non-Chalcedonianism, whereas the province of Syria Secunda, which was home to a large Greek population who favoured Chalcedonianism, was hostile towards Severus.

A synod was held at Tyre in Phoenicia in , at which the Council of Chalcedon and Leo&#x27;s Tome was denounced, and Severus declared that the &quot;Henotikon&quot; had annulled the acts of the Council of Chalcedon. Severus began to exchange letters with Sergius the Grammarian at this time as Sergius had written to Antoninus, Bishop of Aleppo, who had asked Severus to respond. Sergius argued that the Synod of Tyre had made serious concessions to Chalcedonians, to which Severus responded with a treatise against Sergius. As patriarch, Severus and Peter of Apamea, Archbishop of Apamea, were alleged to have hired Jewish mercenaries to kill 250 Chalcedonian pilgrims and leave their bodies unburied by the roadside. Chalcedonians also claimed that the monasteries that the pilgrims had fled to were set alight and the monks that had protected them were also killed. Between 514 and 518, John of Caesarea wrote an &quot;apologia&quot; of the Council of Chalcedon in response to Severus&#x27; &quot;Philalethes&quot;. Severus wrote a treatise in defence of &quot;Philalethes&quot;, and began work on a reply to John of Caesarea.

===Exile and death===
Following Anastasius&#x27; death and his succession by Emperor Justin I in July 518, the bishops of Syria Secunda travelled to Constantinople and clamoured for Severus&#x27; deposition. Justin I demanded Severus affirmed the Council of Chalcedon, to which he refused, and the emperor subsequently ordered Irenaeus, Count of the East, to arrest Severus and cut out his tongue. Theodora, wife of Justinian, Justin I&#x27;s nephew and heir, discovered Justin I&#x27;s orders and warned Severus. On 25 September 518, Severus fled Antioch by boat to Alexandria, where he was well received by Pope Timothy III of Alexandria and the city&#x27;s inhabitants. Severus&#x27; arrival in Egypt is celebrated by the Coptic Orthodox Church on 12 October. Despite his deposition, Severus did not cease to be seen as the legitimate Patriarch of Antioch by non-Chalcedonians.

During his exile in Egypt, Severus resided at the monastery of the Ennaton with Pope Timothy, and is known to have performed a number of miracles. He completed his three volume book, &quot;liber contra impium grammaticum&quot;, against John of Caesarea in . In his exile, Julian of Halicarnassus also took up residence at the monastery of the Ennaton and exchanged letters with Severus on the topic of the body of Christ. Whereas Julian had adopted aphthartodocetism, which argued that the body of Christ was incorruptible, Severus argued that the body of Christ was corruptible until the resurrection. He wrote five treatises against Julian, who responded in &quot;peri aphtharsias&quot; and an &quot;apologia&quot;. The non-Chalcedonian community was quickly divided between &quot;Severians&quot;, followers of Severus, and aphthartodocetae, and divisions remained unresolved until 527. The Severians were also known as the &quot;Pthartolatrae&quot;.

Emperor Justinian, who succeeded his uncle Justin I in 527, held a three-day synod at the Palace of Hormisdas in the spring of 532 at Constantinople to restore unity to the church through dialogue between five Chalcedonians and five or more non-Chalcedonians. The emperor invited Severus and promised immunity, however, he chose not to attend on the grounds of age and as he was accused of corruption and bribery, which he vehemently denied. In , the non-Chalcedonian community faced further division with the separation of the Themistians from the Severians. Their leader, Themistius, a deacon at Alexandria, saw himself as defending the Severan view, nevertheless, a new sect was founded after him advocating a more extreme belief of Christ&#x27;s corruptibility. At the invitation of Justinian, in the winter of 534/535, Severus travelled to Constantinople alongside Peter of Apamea and the monk Zooras. At this time, Anthimus I of Constantinople, Archbishop of Trebizond, was consecrated Patriarch of Constantinople and refused to affirm the Council of Chalcedon. Severus successfully convinced Anthimus I to adopt a position in line with himself and Pope Theodosius I of Alexandria.

Severus&#x27; fortunes were quickly overturned as Pope Agapetus I of Rome arrived at Constantinople in March 536. Agapetus swayed Justinian to adopt a firm Chalcedonian position and Anthimus I was replaced by Menas of Constantinople. Menas held a synod from 2 May to 4 June, at the conclusion of which Severus, Anthimus, Peter of Apamea, and Zooras were excommunicated. On 6 August 536, Justinian issued an edict that charged Severus, Anthimus, Peter, and Zooras with Nestorianism and Eutychianism, banned Severus&#x27; books, and banished them from the capital and all major cities. Severus fled Constantinople with the aid of Empress Theodora and returned to Egypt. He resided at the residence of Dorotheus in the city of Sakha until his death on 5 February 538. Dorotheus had Severus&#x27; body moved to the Zogag Monastery, and the relocation of his body is celebrated on 19 December.

==Manichaeism==
Severus of Antioch&#x27;s 123rd homily is famously anti-Manichaean. It has been lost in its original Greek version but a Syriac translation has been preserved. Parts of Severus&#x27; 123rd homily was translated and presented, together with the original Syriac text, by Kugener and Cumont. In this work he mentions an unnamed book by Mani, which is possibly &quot;The Pragmateia&quot;, a Manichaean work now lost (this is however not certain; see doubts expressed in Baker-Brian 2011, 82-83). Although he opposed the Manichaeans, as he writes &quot;From where did the Manichaeans, who are more wicked than any other, get the idea of introducing two principles, both uncreated and without beginning, that is good and evil, light and darkness, which they also call matter?&quot;, his direct citations and explanations of Manichaean beliefs are considered a valuable source by Western scholarship, as the works he cites from are otherwise lost, and his citations of Manichaean texts are among the longest we possess.

<doc id="290595" wikidata="Q289624" url="?curid=290595" title="Emily Carr">
<text>Emily Carr (December 13, 1871 – March 2, 1945) was a Canadian artist who was inspired by the monumental art and villages of the First Nations and the landscapes of British Columbia. She also was a vivid writer and chronicler of life in her surroundings, praised for her &quot;complete candour&quot; and &quot;strong prose&quot;. &quot;Klee Wyck&quot;, her first book, published in 1941, won the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award for non-fiction and this book and others written by her or compiled from her writings later are still much in demand today. 

Carr&#x27;s keynote paintings, such as &quot;The Indian Church&quot; (1929), were not widely known in Canada at first. But her stature as one of Canada&#x27;s most important artists continued to grow. Today, she is considered a cherished figure of Canadian arts and letters. Scholars and the public alike regard her as a Canadian national treasure and the &quot;Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; describes her as a Canadian icon. She has been designated a National Historic Person and had a Minor planet 5688 Kleewyck named after her anglicized native name. As one scholar in her 2014 book on Carr, put it, &quot;we love her and she continues to speak to us&quot;.

Emily Carr lived most of her life in the city in which she was born and died, Victoria, British Columbia.

== Early life ==

Born in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1871, the year British Columbia joined Canada, Emily Carr was the second youngest of nine children born to English parents Richard and Emily (Saunders) Carr. The Carr home was on Birdcage Walk (now Government Street), in the James Bay district of Victoria, a short distance from the legislative buildings (nicknamed the &#x27;Birdcages&#x27;) and the town itself. Today it is a museum and National Historic Site of Canada called Emily Carr House.

The Carr children were raised in an English tradition. Her father believed it was sensible to live on Vancouver Island, a colony of Great Britain, where he could practice English customs and continue his British citizenship. The family home was made up in lavish English fashion, with high ceilings, ornate moldings, and a parlour. Carr was taught in the Presbyterian tradition, with Sunday morning prayers and evening Bible readings. Her father called on one child per week to recite the sermon, and Emily consistently had trouble reciting it.

Carr&#x27;s mother died in 1886, and her father died in 1888. Her oldest sister Edith Carr became the guardian of the rest of the children.

Carr&#x27;s father encouraged her artistic inclinations, but it was only in 1890, after her parents&#x27; deaths, that Carr pursued her art seriously. She studied at the California School of Design in San Francisco for three years (1890–1893) before returning to Victoria. In 1899, in some ways overcoming her family background, Carr visited Ucluelet on the west coast of Vancouver Island. That same year, Carr traveled to London, where she decided to transform herself into a professional artist and to make it her life&#x27;s calling. 

She began her studies at the Westminster School of Art. She then took art classes from John William Whiteley in Bushey, Hertfordshire and afterwards traveled to an art colony in St Ives, Cornwall, studying with Julius Olsson and Algernon Talmage (1901). In 1902, she returned to Bushey, and studied with Whiteley, till she experienced a nervous breakdown and had to convalesce. 

She returned to British Columbia in 1904. In 1905, she gave children&#x27;s art classes as well as creating political cartoons for the &quot;Week&quot;, a newspaper in Victoria and in 1906, Carr took a teaching position in Vancouver at the Vancouver Studio Club and School of Art for a short time – she was a popular teacher but left to open her own studio and give children&#x27;s art classes.

== First works on Indigenous people ==
In 1898, at age 27, Carr made the first of several sketching and painting trips to Aboriginal villages. She stayed in a village near Ucluelet on the west coast of Vancouver Island, home to the Nuu-chah-nulth people, then commonly known to English-speaking people as &#x27;Nootka&#x27;. Carr was given the Indigenous name of &quot;Klee Wyck&quot; and she also chose it as the title of her first book. She later recalled that her time in Ucluelet made &quot;a lasting impression on me&quot;.

In 1907, Carr made a sightseeing trip to Alaska with her sister Alice and decided on her artistic mission of documenting all she could of what she and many others perceived as the &quot;vanishing totems&quot; and way of life of the First Nations. She may have met an American artist on this trip, likely Theodore J. Richardson (1855-1914), who described his project of documenting Indigenous art and architecture (he travelled with Indigenous guides to produce watercolours and pastels in southeast Alaska documenting the Tlingit culture) and that possibly this encounter inspired Carr to initiate her own five–year project of documenting Indigenous villages and their neighbouring forests in British Columbia.

From 1908 to 1910 she made several trips to First Nations communities to record art and villages.

== Work in France ==
Determined to further her knowledge of evolving artistic trends abroad, in 1910 Carr returned to Europe to study. In Montparnasse with her sister Alice, Emily Carr met modernist painter Harry Phelan Gibb with a letter of introduction. Upon viewing his work, she and her sister were shocked and intrigued by his use of distortion and vibrant colour; she wrote:&quot;Mr Gibb&#x27;s landscapes and still life delighted me — brilliant, luscious, clean. Against the distortion of his nudes I felt revolt.&quot; 

Carr enrolled at the Académie Colarossi in Paris, then transferred to private lessons with John Duncan Fergusson and followed him to the Atelier Blanche. After a bout of illness, she joined Gibb and his wife in the small village of Crécy-en-Brie and then St. Efflam, Brittany. Carr&#x27;s study with Gibb and his techniques shaped and influenced her style of painting, and she adopted a vibrant colour palette rather than continuing with the more modified colours of her earlier training.
In Crecy-en-Brie she fully embraced the Fauve style of bold colour and broad brushwork, then traveled to Concarneau on the coast of Brittany to study with Frances Hodgkins. When she returned to Paris she found that two of her paintings had been selected by the jury and hung in the 1911 Salon d&#x27;Automne.

== Return to Canada ==

In March 1912 Carr opened a studio at 1465 West Broadway in Vancouver. She organized an exhibition of seventy watercolours and oils representative of her time in France, using her radical new style, bold colour palette and lack of detail. She was the first artist to introduce Post-Impressionism to Vancouver.

Later in 1912, Carr took a sketching trip to First Nations&#x27; villages in Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands), the Upper Skeena River, and Alert Bay where she documented the art of the Haida, Gitxsan and Tsimshian. At Cumshewa, a Haida village on Moresby Island, she wrote in &quot;Klee Wyck&quot;,
&quot;Cumshewa seems always to drip, always to be blurred with mist, its foliage always to hang wet-heavy ... these strong young trees ... grew up round the dilapidated old raven, sheltering him from the tearing winds now that he was old and rotting ... the memory of Cumshewa is of a great lonesomeness smothered in a blur of rain&quot;. 

Carr painted a carved raven, which she later developed as her iconic painting &quot;Big Raven&quot;. &quot;Tanoo&quot;, another painting inspired by work gathered on this trip, depicts three totems before house fronts at the village of the same name. On her return to the south, Carr organized a large exhibition of some of this work. She gave a detailed public talk titled &quot;Lecture on Totem Poles&quot; about the Aboriginal villages that she had visited, which ended with her mission statement:

&quot;I glory in our wonderful west and I hope to leave behind me some of the relics of its first primitive greatness. These things should be to us Canadians what the ancient Briton&#x27;s relics are to the English. Only a few more years and they will be gone forever into silent nothingness and I would gather my collection together before they are forever past&quot;.

Her &quot;Lecture on Totems&quot; at Dominion Hall in Vancouver is in the Emily Carr Papers at the British Columbia Provincial Archives in Victoria. In the lecture, she said &quot;every pole shown in my collection has been studied from its own actual reality...&quot; 

While there was some positive reaction to her work, even in the new &#x27;French&#x27; style, Carr perceived that Vancouver&#x27;s reaction to her work and new style was not positive enough to support her career. She recounted as much in her book &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. She was determined to give up teaching and working in Vancouver, and in 1913 she returned to Victoria, where several of her sisters still lived.

During the next 15 years, Carr did little painting. She ran a boarding house known as the &#x27;House of All Sorts&#x27;. It was the namesake and provided source material for her later book. With her financial circumstances straitened and her life in Victoria circumscribed, Carr painted a few works in this period drawn from local scenes: the cliffs at Dallas Road, the trees in Beacon Hill Park. Her own assessment of the period was that she had ceased to paint, which was not strictly true, although &quot;[a]rt had ceased to be the primary drive of her life&quot;.

== Growing recognition ==
Over time Carr&#x27;s work came to the attention of several influential and supportive people, including (through the intervention of Victoria-born artist Sophie Pemberton in 1921) Harold Mortimer-Lamb and Marius Barbeau, a prominent ethnologist at the National Museum in Ottawa. Barbeau in turn persuaded Eric Brown, Director of Canada&#x27;s National Gallery, to visit Carr in 1927. Brown invited Carr to exhibit her work at the National Gallery as part of an exhibition on West Coast art. Carr sent 65 oil paintings east (31 were included), along with samples of her pottery and rugs with Indigenous designs. The exhibition, which was largely of First Nations art, included works by Edwin Holgate and A.Y. Jackson as well as Carr, traveled to Toronto and Montreal.

== Association with the Group of Seven ==

Carr made the trip east for the exhibition on &quot;West Coast art: Native and modern&quot; at the National Gallery of Canada in 1927. She met Frederick Varley in Vancouver and other members of the Group of Seven, at that time Canada&#x27;s most recognized modern painters at the show&#x27;s Toronto venue. 

Lawren Harris of the Group became an important mentor and friend. &quot;You are one of us,&quot; he told Carr, welcoming her into the ranks of Canada&#x27;s leading modernists and along with other members of the Group into the Group of Seven shows as an invited contributor in 1930 and 1931. 

Her encounter with the Group ended the artistic isolation of Carr&#x27;s previous 15 years, leading to one of her most prolific periods, and the creation of many of her most notable works. Through her extensive correspondence with Harris, Carr also became aware of and studied Northern European symbolism.

Carr&#x27;s artistic direction was influenced by Harris&#x27;s work and the advice he gave in his correspondence (he told her to seek an equivalent for the totem poles in west coast landscape, for instance), but also by his belief in Theosophy. She was deeply interested and struggled to reconcile this with her own conception of God. Carr&#x27;s &quot;distrust for institutional religion&quot; pervades much of her art. She thought a great deal about Theosophic thought, like many artists of the time, but in the end, remained unconvinced.

== Influence of the Pacific Northwest school ==
In 1924 and 1925, Carr exhibited at the Artists of the Pacific Northwest shows in Seattle, Washington. She invited fellow exhibitor Mark Tobey to visit her in Victoria in the autumn of 1928 to teach a master class in her studio. Working with Tobey, Carr furthered her understanding of modern art, experimenting with Tobey&#x27;s methods of full-on abstraction and Cubism, but she was reluctant to follow Tobey beyond the legacy of Cubism. 

Although Carr expressed reluctance about abstraction, Doris Shadbolt at the Vancouver Art Gallery, a major curator of Carr&#x27;s work, records Carr in this period as abandoning the documentary impulse and starting to concentrate instead on capturing the emotional and mythological content embedded in the totemic carvings. She jettisoned her painterly and practiced Post-Impressionist style in favour of creating highly stylized and abstracted geometric forms.

== Later developments ==

Carr continued to travel throughout the late 1920s and 1930s away from Victoria. One of her last trips north was in the summer of 1928, when she visited the Nass and Skeena rivers, as well as Haida Gwaii, formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands. She went to Yuquot (also known as Friendly Cove) and the northeast coast of Vancouver Island in 1930, and then to Lillooet in 1933. In the same year she bought a caravan she nicknamed the &quot;Elephant&quot; and had it towed to places she wanted to paint, going to nearby locations such as Goldstream Flats, the Esquimalt Lagoon and elsewhere. 

Recognition of her work grew steadily, and in 1930 she exhibited in Ottawa, Victoria and Seattle, and in 1935, Carr&#x27;s first solo show of her oil on paper works was held in eastern Canada at the Women&#x27;s Art Association of Canada gallery in Toronto.
In 1938 she had her first annual solo exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery as well as success at the Tate Gallery in London, England. Other shows abroad followed. 

She began to meet other artists. In 1930, for instance, Carr travelled to New York and met Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe. In 1933, she was a founding member of the Canadian Group of Painters.

Paintings from Carr&#x27;s last decade reveal her growing anxiety about the environmental impact of industry on British Columbia&#x27;s landscape. Her work from this time reflected her growing concern over industrial logging, its ecological effects and its encroachment on the lives of Indigenous people. In her painting &quot;Odds and Ends&quot;, from 1939 &quot;the cleared land and tree stumps shift the focus from the majestic forestscapes that lured European and American tourists to the West Coast to reveal instead the impact of deforestation.&quot;

== Shift of focus and late life ==
Carr suffered her first heart attack in 1937, and another in 1939, forcing her to move in with her sister Alice to recover. In 1940 Carr suffered serious trouble with her heart, and in 1942 she had another heart attack. With her ability to travel curtailed, Carr&#x27;s focus shifted from her painting to her writing. The editorial assistance of Carr&#x27;s great friend and literary advisor Ira Dilworth, a professor of English, enabled Carr to see her own first book, &quot;Klee Wyck&quot;, published in 1941. Carr was awarded the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award for non-fiction the same year for the work.

In 1942 Carr established the Emily Carr Trust, and donated close to 170 paintings to the Vancouver Art Gallery. She had the only successful commercial show of her career at the Dominion Gallery in Montreal in 1944. She suffered her last heart attack and died on March 2, 1945, at the James Bay Inn in her hometown of Victoria, British Columbia, shortly before she was to have been awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of British Columbia. Carr is buried at Ross Bay Cemetery.

=== Painting ===

Carr is remembered primarily for her painting. She was one of the artists who attempted to capture the spirit of Canada in a modern style. Carr&#x27;s main themes in her mature work were the monumental works of the First Nations and nature: &quot;native totem poles set in deep forest locations or sites of abandoned native villages&quot; and, later, &quot;the large rhythms of Western forests, driftwood-tossed beaches and expansive skies&quot;. She blended these two themes in ways uniquely her own. Her &quot;qualities of painterly skill and vision [...] enabled her to give form to a Pacific mythos that was so carefully distilled in her imagination&quot;.

At the California School of Design in San Francisco, Carr participated in art classes which were focused on a variety of artistic styles. Many of Carr&#x27;s art professors were trained in the Beaux Arts tradition in Paris, France. Though she took classes in drawing, portraiture, still life, landscape painting, and flower painting, Carr preferred to paint landscapes.

Carr is known for her paintings of First Nations villages and Pacific Northwest Indian totems, but Maria Tippett explains that Carr&#x27;s depictions of the forests of British Columbia from within make her work unique. Carr constructed a new understanding of Cascadia. This understanding includes a new approach to the presentation of native people and Canadian landscapes.

After visiting the Gitksan village of Kitwancool in the summer of 1928, Carr became captivated by the maternal imagery in Pacific Northwest Indigenous totem poles. After Carr was exposed to these types of images, her paintings reflected these images of mother and child in Native carvings.

Her painting can be divided into several distinct phases: her early work, before her studies in Paris; her early paintings under the Fauvist influence of her time in Paris; a Post Impressionist middle period before her encounter with the Group of Seven; and her later, formal period, under the cubist and post-cubist influences of Lawren Harris and American artist and friend, Mark Tobey. Carr used charcoal and watercolour for her sketches, and beginning in 1932, house paint thinned with gasoline on manila paper. The greatest part of her mature work was oil on canvas or, when money was scarce, oil on paper.

== Legacy ==
Carr&#x27;s work is still of relevance today to contemporary artists. Her painting &quot;Old Time Coast Village&quot; (1929–30) is referred to in Korean Canadian artist Jin-me Yoon&#x27;s &quot;A Group of Sixty-Seven&quot; (1996). The work is composed of sixty-seven portraits of the Korean Canadian community in Vancouver standing in front of &quot;Old Time Coast Village&quot; and a landscape painting by Group of Seven member Lawren Harris. She is the subject of books and articles by authors such as Greta Moray and many others.

== Recognition ==
Carr&#x27;s life itself made her a &quot;Canadian icon&quot;, according to the &quot;Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;. As well as being &quot;an artist of stunning originality and strength&quot;, she was an exceptionally late bloomer, starting the work for which she is best known at the age of 57 (see Grandma Moses). Carr was also an artist who succeeded against the odds, living in an artistically unadventurous society, and working mostly in seclusion away from major art centres, thus making her &quot;a darling of the women&#x27;s movement&quot; (like Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, whom she met in 1930 in New York City). Emily Carr brought the north to the south; the west to the east; glimpses of the ancient culture of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas to the most newly arrived Europeans on the continent.

However, art historians who write about Carr in depth often respond to their particular points of view: Feminist studies (Sharyn R. Udall, 2000), First Nations scholarship (Gerta Moray, 2006), or the critical study of what an artist says as a tool to analyze the work itself (Charles C. Hill, Ian M. Thom, 2006).

In 1952, works by Emily Carr along with those of David Milne, Goodridge Roberts and Alfred Pellan represented Canada at the Venice Biennale.
On February 12, 1971, Canada Post issued a 6¢ stamp &#x27;Emily Carr, painter, 1871–1945&#x27; designed by William Rueter based on Carr&#x27;s &quot;Big Raven&quot; (1931), held by the Vancouver Art Gallery. On May 7, 1991, Canada Post issued a 50¢ stamp &#x27;Forest, British Columbia, Emily Carr, 1931–1932&#x27; designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on &quot;Forest, British Columbia&quot; (1931–1932), also from the Vancouver Art Gallery collection.

In 1978, she was awarded the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts Medal. In 2014–2015, the Dulwich Picture Gallery in south London hosted a solo exhibition, the first time such show was held in Britain. In 2020, a travelling exhibition organized by the Audain Art Museum in Whistler, B.C. and co-curated by Kiriko Watanabe and Dr. Kathryn Bridge and titled &quot;Emily Carr: Fresh Seeing – French Modernism and the West Coast&quot; explored this aspect of Carr&#x27;s work in detail.

<text>Benjamin Paul Akers (July 10, 1825 – May 21, 1861) was an American sculptor from Maine.

==Early life==
He was born in 1825 in rural Saccarappa, Maine, into a large and indigent family. When his father, Deacon Akers, moved the family from Saccarappa to Salmon Falls on the Saco River, he started a wood-turning mill. For six years the young Akers worked in his father&#x27;s mill, where he invented beautiful patterns and &quot;turned&quot; toys. His brother, Charles &quot;Carl&quot; Akers, was also a sculptor and crayon portrait artist. He wrote articles on art for the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; and also &quot;The Crayon&quot;, a short-lived New York art magazine in the mid-19th century. Akers spent the winter of 1849 in Boston learning the art of plaster casting with the sculptor Joseph Carew. In 1850 he opened a studio in Portland, Maine. He received a &quot;Commemorative Silver Medal&quot; in the 1854 Exhibition and Fair of the Maine Charitable Mechanic Association. The award was for his bas relief called &quot;Peace&quot;. In 1855, at age 30, he went to Rome, Italy where he worked for several years.

His experience in Italy and its revelation to his immature art-spirit he discloses in a letter written in 1853:
:&quot;I was thrown at once from a world where not in all my life had I seen art, although I lived there with my own shadowy creations—not strong, for I knew not the mighty or the feeble—thrown at once into a world where all was art. All around me, on earth, in the far heavens, were multitudes of forms, all silent but all demanding place; and none might help me, none to say &#x27;here&#x27; or &#x27;there&#x27;; I only in this mighty realm to appoint, to assign. I was set down in the Louvre a boy from the woods of that new world, no idle spectator.&quot;

==Career==
Patron John Neal claimed Akers was &quot;the first person, man or woman, that ever tried to model anything in the shape of a head&quot; in Portland, Maine. Neal provided Akers a studio space and commissioned his first bust. Among his works are busts of Edward Everett and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a head of John Milton and &quot;The Dead Pearl Diver&quot;, on display at the Portland Museum of Art. Nathaniel Hawthorne described &quot;Dead Pearl Diver&quot; as an important work of the protagonist, Kenyon, in his novel &quot;The Marble Faun&quot;, acknowledging his debt to Akers in the introduction. Neal lamented his passing, claiming that &quot;had he lived a few years longer, he would have built up a reputation for himself and his beloved country, well worth coveting.

He planned a free gallery of art for New York, to contain copies in marble of the chief works of ancient art, but in the midst of his work and plans his health failed and he returned home in 1858, and the next year started for Rome, where after his arrival he entered upon the execution of a commission from August Belmont of a statue of Commodore Perry for Central Park, New York, which was left unfinished.

==Marriage and children==
In 1858 Akers met Elizabeth Taylor Allen a young mother, journalist and poet, and they married in August 1860 in Hollis. Their only child, Gertrude Rothermel, died in infancy. Akers died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 21, 1861, from tuberculosis. He is buried in Portland&#x27;s Evergreen Cemetery.

<doc id="290608" wikidata="Q2266831" url="?curid=290608" title="Tusken Raiders">
<text>Tusken Raiders are a fictional alien race in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. They first appeared in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977).

==Depiction==
The Tusken Raiders are depicted as xenophobic and are known to be aggressive in their interactions with other species, though they are capable of compromise and cooperation with outsiders. They dress in heavy cloth robes, and cover their heads with strips of cloth to secure a breath mask and eye protection. They learned to train the Banthas native to Tatooine as mounts, and a marauding group of Tuskens will ride them single file, to hide their numbers.

==&quot;Star Wars&quot; appearances==
Tusken Raiders first appeared in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). Early on in the film, a party of them attack Luke Skywalker and knock him unconscious. However, Obi-Wan Kenobi frightens them off by imitating the call of a local predator and rescues Luke.

Tusken Raiders briefly appear in &quot;Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot;, taking shots at the Boonta Eve Classic podracer pilots, and again in &quot;Episode II: Attack of the Clones&quot;, set 22 years before &quot;Star Wars&quot;; in this film, they kidnap Anakin Skywalker&#x27;s mother, Shmi Skywalker, and torture her for a month. Anakin eventually finds her, but she is mortally injured and dies in his arms. Seized by a violent rage, Anakin slaughters the entire tribe out of revenge, including the women and children. This was referenced by Chancellor Palpatine in &quot;Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&quot; to justify Anakin&#x27;s reasoning for killing Count Dooku, and after he says it, a faint sound of the Tusken Raider&#x27;s braying calls is heard in Anakin&#x27;s mind as he ponders. In &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; Season 3, Episode 20, a group of Tuskens attack Ezra and Chopper when they land on Tatooine to look for Kenobi, successfully destroying their ship. However, Ezra and Chopper escape and the Tuskens are killed by Darth Maul.

Tusken Raiders appear in &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;. In the Season 1 episode &quot;Chapter 5: The Gunslinger&quot;, Din Djarin comes across a small group of Raiders while travelling through their land, in search of a bounty. They are initially hostile until he communicates with them via sign language. In the Season 2 episode &quot;Chapter 9: The Marshal&quot;, a Tusken clan teams up with villagers from Mos Pelgo in order to slay a Krayt dragon.

A tribe of Tusken Raiders appear in various flashbacks in the first three episodes of &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;, where they find Boba Fett after the latter escaped from the Sarlacc, was robbed of his Mandalorian armor, and left for dead. They initially force him to work as a slave digging for black melons in the desert, until he wins their respect and admiration after he kills a large sand creature, saving a Tusken child&#x27;s life in the process. Following this, the Tuskens welcome Fett as one of their own, teaching him their combat style and desert survival skills, and eventually initiating him into their tribe after he passes a trial. In turn, Fett helps the Tuskens raid a Pyke Syndicate spice train that had been attacking their territory, teaching them how to ride speeder bikes in the process, and demands that the Pykes pay a toll to the tribe before entering their territory again in the future. However, after returning from collecting the toll, Fett finds that the tribe has been massacred, seemingly by the Nikto gang he had stolen the speeder bikes from, and holds an impromptu funeral. In the seventh episode, it is revealed that it was the Pykes who killed the tribe and framed the Nikto gang.

==Expanded Universe==

According to the noncanon &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe sources, Tusken Raiders are named after Fort Tusken, an early Old Republic mining settlement in which all of the settlers were overwhelmed, captured, or killed by Tusken Raiders, then referred to as &quot;Sand People&quot;. The attack probably occurred due to the fort&#x27;s placement over one of the Raiders&#x27; holy wells.

Although the Sand People are aggressive and violent by nature, they have deep-seated traditions that they cling to tightly. Young raiders are required to prove their adulthood in various physical activities. While the Sand People have no written language, the most revered member of a Tusken clan is the storyteller. He knows the life-story of every member of his clan, and also knows of the clan&#x27;s history. The storyteller is required to memorize the histories word-for-word, eliminating any chance for misinterpretation or distortion. Apprentice storytellers often are more hard-pressed to prove themselves than warriors, for a single mistake in reciting the histories means instant death by decapitation. As violent as their nature is, Sand People stay as far from the moisture farmers as the farmers do them. There are occasional skirmishes with the more outlying settlements.

The comic book series &quot;Star Wars: Republic&quot; explains that exiled Jedi Sharad Hett and his son A&#x27;Sharad Hett lived among the Tusken Raiders for many years. Hett was one of the few non-Tuskens to be accepted into their ranks and was even given the title of &quot;warlord&quot;. Although A&#x27;Sharad Hett believed he was half-Tusken for the better part of his life, during his training on Coruscant he learned that Humans and Tusken Raiders were genetically unable to interbreed. This leads him to believe that his mother must have been a human, captured by the Tusken Raiders at a young age and raised as a Tusken. The series &quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot;, set some 200 years later, reveals that A&#x27;Sharad eventually turned to the dark side of the Force and, as the Sith Lord Darth Krayt, briefly conquered the galaxy.

In the &quot;Junior Jedi Knights&quot; and &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; series, it is revealed that Jedi Knight Tahiri Veila was raised by the Tusken Raiders after they killed her parents.

A Tusken Raider named &quot;Hoar&quot; appears as a playable character in the PlayStation fighting game &quot;Star Wars: Masters of Teräs Käsi&quot;. In the Xbox Original game &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront II&quot; players are allowed to play as Tusken Raiders in a special game mode called &quot;hunt&quot;.

Tusken Raiders appear in &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot; and &quot;The Old Republic&quot; when players visit Tatooine. 
In &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, it is suggested that humans, Jawas, and Tusken Raiders share a common ancestry and that Tusken Raiders refer to themselves as the &quot;ghorfa&quot;.

==Concept and creation==

&quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas said that the Tuskens&#x27; design was inspired by the Bedouin, an Arab tribe from the desert regions of North Africa.

=== Tusken Sign Language ===
In his script for &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; episode &quot;Chapter 5: The Gunslinger&quot;, Dave Filoni mentioned that the Tusken Raiders should use some form of sign language. Deaf actor Troy Kotsur was hired as a consultant. When developing the sign language, he attempted to avoid American Sign Language and suit the Tuskens&#x27; cultural and environmental context. A lifelong &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan, Kotsur also played a Tusken scout in the episode. The sign language later appeared to a greater extent in &quot;Chapter 9: The Marshal&quot;, as well as the first three episodes of &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;.

&quot;Chapter 5: The Gunslinger&quot; was the first time that Tuskens had communicated on-screen. Media outlets praised the sign language for humanizing the Tuskens and moving away from their characterization as indigenous &quot;savages&quot;. Fans, especially deaf viewers, were similarly enthusiastic about the inclusion of an alien sign language in &quot;Star Wars&quot; and started a Facebook group to further develop the Tusken language.

== Reception and cultural impact ==

Tusken Raiders have been criticized as an Arab or Islamic stereotype.
Further cultural criticism compares the representation of the Tusken Raiders to stereotypes of Indigenous people.

<text>Eat a Peach is an album by the American rock group the Allman Brothers Band. Produced by Tom Dowd, it was released by Capricorn Records on February 12, 1972. It was the band&#x27;s fourth album. A double album, it contains a mix of live and studio recordings. Following their artistic and commercial breakthrough with the July 1971 release of the live album &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;, the Allman Brothers Band got to work on what was originally intended to be their third studio album. But on October 29, 1971, lead and slide guitarist Duane Allman, group leader and founder, was killed in a motorcycle accident in the band&#x27;s adopted hometown of Macon, Georgia, making it the final album to feature him. 

&quot;Eat a Peach&quot; contains studio recordings from September–December 1971 at Criteria Studios, Miami—both with and without Duane Allman—and live recordings from several of the band&#x27;s 1971 performances at the Fillmore East. The album includes the extended half-hour-long &quot;Mountain Jam&quot;, which was long enough to take up two full sides of the original double-LP. Other highlights include vocalist Gregg Allman&#x27;s performance of his brother&#x27;s favorite song, &quot;Melissa&quot;, plus Dickey Betts&#x27; &quot;Blue Sky&quot;, which went on to become a classic rock radio staple. The album artwork was created by W. David Powell and J. F. Holmes at Wonder Graphics, and depicts the band&#x27;s name on a peach truck, in addition to a large gatefold mural of mushrooms and fairies. The album&#x27;s title came from a quote by Duane Allman: &quot;You can&#x27;t help the revolution, because there&#x27;s just evolution ... Every time I&#x27;m in Georgia, I eat a peach for peace&quot;.

On release &quot;Eat a Peach&quot; was an immediate commercial success and peaked at number four on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 Pop Albums chart. The album was later certified platinum and remains a top seller in the band&#x27;s discography.

==Background==
The Allman Brothers Band had struggled to achieve commercial success in their two and a half years on the touring circuit; their first two studio albums, &quot;The Allman Brothers Band&quot; (1969) and &quot;Idlewild South&quot; (1970), had debuted to only modest sales. Despite this, they had achieved significant acclaim due to their live performances, which included extended jam renditions of songs. The band&#x27;s third release was a live album, titled &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;, and represented their artistic and commercial breakthrough: it immediately received solid sales upon its July 1971 release and went gold some months later. In about a &quot;three-or-four-week period&quot;, the band quite literally went from &quot;rags to riches&quot;, and were able to pay their debts to manager Phil Walden and record label Capricorn Records.

Although suddenly wealthy and successful, much of the band and its entourage now struggled with substance abuse, which included instances of heroin addiction. Four individuals—group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Joseph &quot;Red Dog&quot; Campbell—checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. Their addictions had begun to affect their performances and matters seemed to only be getting worse, according to many involved. The clinic was deemed a &quot;joke&quot; and a &quot;nuthouse&quot; by Payne and Red Dog, and was later described as more of a psychiatric ward, as true rehabilitation clinics were several years away. All involved (including Duane) struggled to keep off the substance in the ensuing days. Despite his struggles, Duane fueled the band&#x27;s passion to get better and end their addictions: &quot;Duane was so happy and full of positive energy. He was always like that unless he was just totally wasted. He was the leader, the great soul, and he kept saying, &#x27;We are on a mission and it&#x27;s time for this thing to happen,&#x27;&quot; said Linda Oakley. &quot;He was moving forward, and that energized everyone else. Everyone fed off of that.&quot;

On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, aged 24, was killed in a motorcycle accident a day after returning to the band&#x27;s home of Macon, Georgia from an extended tour of concert gigs. Allman was exceeding a safe speed at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a flatbed lumber crane approached. The flatbed truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either the back of the truck or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle. The motorcycle bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another with him pinned underneath, crushing several internal organs. Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery he died several hours later from massive internal injuries. The loss devastated all who knew him, just as &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; climbed into the top 15 of the national album charts.

==Recording and production==

Several weeks before the gold certification of &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; and their rehabilitation, the band headed to Miami&#x27;s Criteria Studios to work on their third studio album. Once again they&#x27;d be working with producer Tom Dowd, whom had been instrumental in the successful recording and production of &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;. The band laid down the initial tracks for &quot;Blue Sky&quot;. The band saved money on studio time by writing and debuting songs on the road. The band worked on three songs: &quot;Blue Sky&quot;, an instrumental titled &quot;The Road to Calico&quot; (which would eventually develop into &quot;Stand Back&quot;, with added vocals) and &quot;Little Martha&quot;, the only song solely credited to Duane Allman. The band laid down these three songs and went back on the road for a short run of shows, and at this point several checked into rehab. After Duane&#x27;s death, the band held a meeting on their future; it was clear all wanted to continue, and after a short period, they returned to the road. Drummer Butch Trucks later said, &quot;We all had this thing in us and Duane put it there. He was the teacher and he gave something to us—his disciples—that we had to play out.&quot;

Following Duane&#x27;s death, which severely impacted his younger brother, organist/lead vocalist/songwriter Gregg Allman, lead guitarist Dickey Betts gradually took over as group leader. The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on the album. Twiggs Lyndon, the band&#x27;s former head roadie, joined them; he had just completed a stay in a psychiatric hospital stemming from his 1970 arrest for the murder of a concert promoter at one of the band&#x27;s shows. Lyndon became the band&#x27;s production manager. The band recorded three more tracks with Dowd, including &quot;Melissa&quot;, &quot;Les Brers in A Minor&quot;, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Wastin&#x27; Time No More&quot;. Allman&#x27;s death provided the band with motivation: &quot;We were all putting more into it, trying so hard to make it as good as it would have been with Duane. We knew our driving force, our soul, the guy that set us all on fire, wasn&#x27;t there and we had to do something for him,&quot; said Trucks. The heroin addictions had taken their toll on the band members; Gregg Allman later said, &quot;We were taking vitamins, we had doctors coming over and sticking us in the ass with B12 shots every day. Little by little by little, we crawled back up to the point where we were standing erect.&quot;

The other material on &quot;Eat a Peach&quot; comes from live recordings. Dowd later said, &quot;When we recorded &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;, we ended up with almost a whole other album&#x27;s worth of good material, and we used [two] tracks on &quot;Eat a Peach&quot;. Again, there was no overdubbing&quot;. Dowd started the mixing process for &quot;Eat a Peach&quot; but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, &quot;As I mixed songs like &quot;Blue Sky,&quot; I knew, of course, that I was listening to the last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there&#x27;s not going to be any more from him&quot;. He was particularly proud of his mixing work on the album, but was angry because he did not receive credit, only a &quot;special thanks&quot;.

Completing the recording of &quot;Eat a Peach&quot; raised each members&#x27; spirits. Said Allman, &quot;The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing &quot;Eat a Peach&quot;&quot;. &quot;Those last three songs ... just kinda floated right on out of us ... The music was still good, it was still rich, and it still had that energy—it was still the Allman Brothers Band.&quot;

==Composition==
Much of the music on &quot;Eat a Peach&quot; that was recorded after Duane&#x27;s death directly dealt with the tragedy. &quot;Ain&#x27;t Wastin&#x27; Time No More&quot; was written by Gregg Allman for his brother immediately following his death. The song was composed when Duane was still alive, on a 110-year-old Steinway piano in Studio D of Criteria, but the lyrics deal with his passing, as well as veterans coming home from the Vietnam War. The song relates to the theme that &quot;death is an inescapable inevitability—that every day is precious.&quot; &quot;Les Brers in A Minor&quot; is an instrumental written by Dickey Betts, and its title is &quot;bad French&quot; for &quot;less brothers&quot;. When rehearsing the song, all in the band felt something was familiar about it—which turned out to be a solo of Betts&#x27;s from live renditions of &quot;Whipping Post&quot; that resurfaced many years later on a bootleg recording. Recording of &quot;Les Brers&quot; began in the newly constructed Studio C of the recording complex at Criteria, but the band disliked the sound captured in the room and moved to Studio A. As a result, the recording contains a slight pitch variation due to the difficulty of matching the original speed of the instruments when the intro was spliced onto the master tape.

Gregg Allman recorded &quot;Melissa&quot; primarily as a tribute to his brother, who adored the song; the song was written in 1967 while staying in a hotel in Pensacola, Florida, and was one of the first he saved after dozens of writing attempts. Allman had previously not shown it to other members of the band (&quot;I thought it was too soft for the Allman Brothers,&quot; he said), and was saving it for a possible solo album he assumed he would one day record. &quot;One Way Out&quot; was recorded on June 27, 1971, the final night of concerts at the Fillmore East, which the band, a favorite of the famed venue&#x27;s promoter Bill Graham, headlined; &quot;Trouble No More&quot; and &quot;Mountain Jam&quot; were culled from the band&#x27;s March performances there. &quot;Mountain Jam&quot; was always intended for inclusion on the band&#x27;s next album; the band teased its appearance by including the opening seconds on the fade-out of the final song on &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;. The band considered it a signature song of the group, but they deemed the performance that was recorded relatively mediocre.

==Artwork and title==
The album&#x27;s artwork was created by W. David Powell at Wonder Graphics. He had seen old postcards at a drugstore in Athens, Georgia, one depicting a peach on a truck and a watermelon on a rail car. Believing them perfect for an Allman Brothers album, he purchased them and &quot;bought cans of pink and baby-blue Krylon spray paint and created a matted area to make the cards on a twelve-by-twenty-four LP cover.&quot; He envisioned the album having &quot;an early-morning-sky feel&quot;. He hand-lettered the band name and photographed it with a small Kodak camera, developing the photos at the drugstore. He then cut and pasted the letters on the side of the truck, underneath the peach.

The album includes an elaborate gatefold mural featuring a fantasy landscape of mushrooms (referencing the psychedelic drug, a band favorite in its early days) and fairies, drawn by Powell and J. F. Holmes. There was very little planning involved in the piece, which was created when the duo were in Vero Beach, Florida. When one would be drawing or painting the image, another would be swimming in the ocean. &quot;We swapped off this way with virtually no conversation about the drawing, just fluid trade-offs,&quot; said Powell. The art was created on a large illustration board, &quot;on a one-to-one scale—it was the size of the actual spread,&quot; according to Powell. Holmes&#x27; work is featured largely on the left, with Powell&#x27;s on the right. Both were &quot;profoundly influenced&quot; by Early Netherlandish painter Hieronymous Bosch on the piece.

At the time the artwork was finalized, Duane Allman was still alive and the title had not been finalized. As a result, the album lacks a title on the cover, which was an unusual approach for bands at the time. Powell later said, &quot;When we showed it to someone at the label, he said, &#x27;They are so hot right now, we could sell it in a brown paper bag&#x27;&quot;. Atlantic initially intended to title the album &quot;The Kind We Grow in Dixie&quot;, the label of the postcard series Powell had seen in Athens, but the band refused. Trucks suggested they name the album &quot;Eat a Peach for Peace&quot;, after a quote from Duane Allman. When the writer Ellen Mandel asked him what he was doing to help the revolution, he replied:

Drummer Butch Trucks considered Allman&#x27;s comment a sly reference to the poem &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; by T. S. Eliot, one of Allman&#x27;s favorite poets. An untrue story persisted for many years after the album&#x27;s release that it was named after the truck Allman crashed into, purported to be a peach truck. The album art was later selected by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 1991 as one of the 100 greatest album covers of all time.

==Release==

Before the release of &quot;Eat a Peach&quot;, industry talk suggested the demise of the group after the death of Duane Allman. The record&#x27;s promotional campaign was coordinated by Dick Wooley, the former head of promotion for Atlantic Records. He had recently quit his position there and was contacted by Walden to help Capricorn in its efforts. (Capricorn Records had recently separated from Atlantic Records as well; &quot;Eat a Peach&quot; would be among the first Capricorn albums released under a new distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records.) &quot;They needed help because the buzz in the record business and on the street was that the ABB was finished as a band and would never survive without Duane,&quot; said Wooley. After being played some songs from &quot;Eat a Peach&quot; by Sandlin, Wooley was &quot;blown away&quot; and accepted the offer at half his usual salary. He arranged to have the band&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve performance at New Orleans&#x27; Warehouse live simulcast on radio. &quot;I took a gamble and cobbled together a network of radio stations in the Southeast via Ma Bell phone lines,&quot; said Wooley. The stunt helped launch &quot;Eat a Peach&quot;, which was issued by Capricorn in February 1972 and became an instant success. The album shipped enough copies to be certified by the RIAA as gold and peaked at number four on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 Pop Albums chart. &quot;We&#x27;d been through hell, but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever,&quot; said Gregg Allman.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Tony Glover wrote that, even without their leader, &quot;the Allman Brothers are still the best goddamned band in the land ... I hope the band keeps playing forever—how many groups can you think of who really make you believe they&#x27;re playing for the joy of it?&quot; In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau called side three &quot;a magnificent testament&quot;, but was relatively unimpressed by the rest of the album, especially the low-tempo &quot;Mountain Jam&quot; sides: &quot;I know the pace of living is slow down there, but this verges on the comatose. And all the tape in the world isn&#x27;t going to bring Duane back.&quot; In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the record a showcase of &quot;the Allmans at their peak&quot;. David Quantick of BBC Music also considered it their &quot;creative peak&quot;, praising the album&#x27;s &quot;well-played, surprisingly lean bluesy rock&quot;. The album is mentioned as the band&#x27;s top studio recording in the 2008 book &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot; (2008), with author Tom Moon praising the record&#x27;s &quot;sedate, beautifully contemplative studio material&quot;.

&quot;Melissa&quot; was the album&#x27;s most successful single, peaking at number 65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Ain&#x27;t Wastin&#x27; Time No More&quot; and &quot;One Way Out&quot; were also singles, charting at numbers 77 and 86, respectively.

==Touring==
Biographer Alan Paul notes that the band&#x27;s members &quot;all profoundly felt the absence of their guiding light&quot; during the touring cycle for &quot;Eat a Peach&quot;. Dickey Betts had to convince the band members to tour, since all other members were reluctant. Despite rumors, the band did not replace Duane Allman, and simply toured as a five-piece. The Allman Brothers Band played 90 shows in 1972 in support of the record. &quot;We were playing for him and that was the way to be closest to him,&quot; said Trucks. Allman and Oakley took turns introducing songs, which was traditionally Duane&#x27;s role. Betts learned Duane&#x27;s slide guitar parts, but put his own spin on them. Oakley had a downward spiral following Duane&#x27;s death and was significantly inebriated for many shows on the tour. &quot;He wasn&#x27;t playing like he used to—instead, he&#x27;d hit maybe every fifth note,&quot; recalled Allman. Occasionally, the band would have bassist Joe Dan Petty, later of Grinderswitch, cover for Oakley for the show. After nearly a year of severe depression, Oakley was killed in a motorcycle accident not dissimilar from his friend&#x27;s in November 1972.

Many label mates on Capricorn opened for the band, including Wet Willie, Cowboy, and Dr. John.

<doc id="290610" wikidata="Q326302" url="?curid=290610" title="Ouray (Ute leader)">
<text>Ouray (, c. 1833 – August 20, 1880) was a Native American chief of the Tabeguache (Uncompahgre) band of the Ute tribe, then located in western Colorado. Because of his leadership ability, Ouray was acknowledged by the United States government as a chief of the Ute and he traveled to Washington, D.C. to negotiate for the welfare of the Utes. Raised in the culturally diverse town of Taos, Ouray learned to speak many languages that helped him in the negotiations, which were complicated by the manipulation of his grief over his five-year-old son, abducted during an attack by the Sioux. Ouray met with Presidents Lincoln, Grant, and Hayes and was called the &quot;man of peace&quot; because he sought to make treaties with settlers and the government.

Following the Meeker Massacre (White River War) of 1879, he traveled in 1880 to Washington, D.C. He tried to secure a treaty for the Uncompahgre Ute, who wanted to stay in Colorado; but, the following year, the United States forced the Uncompahgre and the White River Ute to the west to reservations in present-day Utah.

==Early life and education==

Ouray was born in 1833 near the Taos Pueblo in Nuevo México, now in the state of New Mexico. His father, Guera Murah, also called Salvador, was a Jicarilla Apache adopted into the Ute, and his mother was Uncompahgre Ute.

His parents had another son named Quench, and then his mother died soon after. His father remarried and his stepmother left Ouray and his brother to live on a ranch with a Spanish-speaking couple around 1843 or 1845. His father returned to Colorado and became a leader of the &quot;Tabeguache&quot; Ute band and the boys remained in Taos. Ouray received a Catholic education and was raised in the Catholic faith. Living in a culturally diverse location, he learned Ute and Apache languages, sign language, Spanish, and English, which he found helpful later in life in negotiating with whites and Native Americans. He spent much of his youth working for Mexican sheepherders. He also hauled wood and packed mules that were bound for the Santa Fe Trail.

In 1850, Ouray and his brother left Taos to join their father, who died soon after. Ouray was the band&#x27;s best rider, hunter, and fighter, and he became an enforcer (like a chief of police) and then sub-chief of the band. He fought both the Kiowa and the Sioux while living among the Tabeguache.

==Chief and negotiator==

===Chief===
In 1860, Ouray became chief of the band at the age of 27. That year, he engaged in a &quot;fact-finding tour&quot; to determine the number of whites that were settling in the Uncompahgre and Gunnison River valleys and was alarmed by the number of miners and settlers on ancestral lands of the Utes. He understood, though, that fighting the whites would not turn back the tide of immigrants. Instead, he believed that the solution was to engage in treaty negotiations to protect their interests.

===Treaty negotiation===

Ouray was known as the &quot;White man&#x27;s friend,&quot; and his services were almost indispensable to the government in negotiating with his tribe, who kept in good faith all treaties that were made by him. He protected their interests as far as possible, and set them the example of living a civilized life.

It might be added that Ouray himself, who pronounced his name as &#x27;You-ray&#x27;, never seemed to have objected to being called &#x27;Chief of all the Utes&#x27; and he did not hesitate to sign documents by that title. 

Although Ouray sought reconciliation between different peoples, with the belief that war with the whites likely meant the demise of the Ute tribe, other more militant Utes considered him a coward for his propensity to negotiate. Disturbed by the treaties that Ouray entered into, his brother-in-law &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; tried to kill him with an axe during his near-daily visit to the Los Piños Indian Agency in 1874.

====Treaty of Conejos of 1863====
Colorado Territory was established on February 28, 1861. In 1862, he convinced Utes to negotiate with the government to enter into a treaty to ensure the protection of hereditary lands of the Tabeguache. Kit Carson had noticed in 1862 that prospectors were mining and settling in areas that had been traditional hunting grounds for the Utes and game was becoming scarce. Carson helped him draft a treaty. Ouray was part of the delegation and was the translator in a meeting with the new Territorial Governor John Evans, after which he traveled to Washington, D.C. to meet with President Abraham Lincoln.
Ouray negotiated with the U.S. government for the Treaty of Conejos (1863), which reduced their lands to 50% of what it had been, losing all lands east of the Continental Divide that included healing waters at Manitou Springs and the sacred land on Pikes Peak. It guaranteed that they would have the western one third of the state of the Colorado. The Utes agreed that they would allow roads and military forts to be built on the land. As an encouragement to take up farming, they were given sheep, cattle, and $10,000 in goods and provisions over ten years. The government generally did not provide the goods, provisions, or livestock mentioned in the treaty, and since game was scarce many Ute continued to hunt on ancestral Ute lands until they were removed to reservations in 1880 and 1881.
====Treaty of 1868====
Around 1866, there were some Native Americans who had stolen livestock and otherwise upset new settlers. Following an uprising by Chief Kaniatse, Colonel Kit Carson successfully negotiated a treaty with the Ouray and other Ute leaders in 1867. In the meantime, the government became interested in obtaining some more Ute land. Since the government had not lived up to its agreement to provide provisions for the winter months, Ouray was reluctant to give the government more land. Many Native Americans, though, were &quot;in dire straits&quot; and he agreed to be part of a delegation.

In 1868, Ouray, Nicaagat, with Kit Carson were among a delegation to negotiate a treaty that would result in the creation of a reservation for the Ute, served by an Indian Agencies at White River and near Montrose with a school, blacksmith shop, sawmill, and warehouse. They lost a little land in the treaty, but Ouray hoped that having a government presence would mean that their lands would be protected. The treaty was signed by 47 Ute chiefs.

====Brunot Treaty of 1873====
Silver deposits were found in the San Juan Mountains in 1872 and the government wanted again to negotiate for more land. Feeding on his grief due to the unknown status of his son after the Utes were attacked by the Sioux, U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs Felix Brunot had a 17-year-old orphan brought by Arapaho Chief Powder Face to meet Ouray and Chipeta in Washington, D.C. ten years after the abduction. This was the first of many attempts by Brunot to find his son and was conducted so that Ouray would relinquish mining property and keep treaty talks open. The boy was clearly not Ouray&#x27;s son, he did not know anything from the Ute language, did not want to go with Ouray, and the details of his capture did not match the experience of Ouray&#x27;s son. Tribal historians have stated that this meeting was upsetting to Ouray, but author Richard E. Wood states that the chief was impressed by the effort taken by the government. In 1873, with Ouray&#x27;s help, the Brunot Agreement was ratified and the United States acquired the mineral-rich property they had been seeking. In exchange, the Native Americans were to receive provisions over time. Ouray was given land and a house in the Uncompahgre Valley near the Indian Agency. The government, though, was again reluctant to provide provisions. His negotiations had included a meeting with President Ulysses S. Grant.

===Meeker Massacre===

Tensions increased in the area following the Meeker Massacre (1879) at the White River Indian Agency. Not understanding the Utes&#x27; love of horses, Nathan Meeker had their race track plowed and tried to force the nomadic hunters and gatherers to farm, and Meeker sought military help. Seeking peace, a tribe of Ute men led by Chief Douglas asked Meeker for peace, but a fight ensued. This made further negotiations for peace between Native Americans and whites very difficult. Local settlers demanded that the Utes be moved. When Ouray found out about the massacre, he asked, as head of the Utes, for the warriors to disperse and release hostages to him. The hostages, including Josephine Meeker, were delivered to Ouray&#x27;s house at the Los Piños Indian Agency and were cared for by Chipeta.

===Final treaty===

The U.S. government appointed a commission to determine a reservation for the Ute and Ouray and Chipeta went to Washington, D.C. in 1880 for the final treaty for the Utes. Members of the commission were Alfred B. Meacham, former U.S. Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon; Otto Mears, a railroad executive, and George W. Manypenny, former Commissioner of Indian Affairs. When President Rutherford B. Hayes met Ouray in Washington, DC, he said that the Ute was &quot;the most intellectual man I&#x27;ve ever conversed with.&quot;

When he had returned to Colorado, and while dying with Bright&#x27;s disease, Ouray traveled to the Ignacio Indian Agency office to have the treaty signed by the Southern Utes.

Utes were later put on a reservation in Utah, Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation, as well as two reservations in Colorado: Ute Mountain Ute Tribe and Southern Ute Indian Reservation.

==Personal life==

Ouray&#x27;s first wife, Black Mare, died after the birth of their only child, a boy named Queashegut, also known as Pahlone, and called &quot;Paron&quot; (apple) by his father because of his round, dimpled face. In 1859, Ouray married the sixteen-year old Chipeta (Ute meaning: White Singing Bird), who had been caring for Ouray&#x27;s son since Black Mare&#x27;s death earlier that year.

When Queashegut was five years old, Ouray took him along on a buffalo hunt with a total party of 31 men in 1860 or 1863. Their hunting camp, near Fort Lupton, was attacked by 300 Sioux warriors and Queashegut left the tepee where he sought shelter with Chipeta to follow Ute warriors. After the fight, they were unable to find him. He had been captured and traded to an Arapaho band. Ouray never saw his son again and remained in deep grief. He tried to find his son for the rest of his life and feared &quot;he was raised to fight against his own.&quot; While visiting Kit Carson at Fort Garland in 1866, Ouray and Chipeta met and adopted two girls and two boys.

Ouray&#x27;s sister, Shawsheen (also Tsashin and Susan), was in Big Thompson Canyon in 1861 or 1863 when she was abducted by the Arapaho. Soldiers from Fort Collins found her two years later in 1863 or 1865, but she was afraid of them and escaped. She was later found by Utes and returned to Ouray&#x27;s tribe.

He had several homes in Colorado, one of them by the town of Ouray. For twenty years, Ouray lived with Chipeta on a farm on the Uncompahgre River near Montrose. The 300-acre farm had pasture land and 50 acres of irrigated farm land. The six-room adobe house was well-furnished, including a piano and fine china. The Ute Indian Museum is located on their original 8.65 acre homestead in Montrose. Chipeta was a member of a Methodist church; Ouray was an Episcopalian. Ouray never cut his long Ute-fashion hair, though he often dressed in the European-American style.
Ouray died on August 24, 1880, near the Los Piños Indian Agency in Colorado. His people secretly buried him near Ignacio, Colorado. Forty-five years later, in 1925, his bones were re-interred in a full ceremony led by Buckskin Charley and John McCook at the Ignacio cemetery.

A 1928 article in the &quot;Denver Post&quot; reads in part, &quot;He saw the shadow of doom on his people&quot; and a 2012 article writes, &quot;He sought peace among tribes and whites, and a fair shake for his people, though Ouray was dealt a sad task of liquidating a once-mighty force that ruled nearly 23 million acres of the Rocky Mountains.&quot;

==Legacy and honors==
Ouray&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Denver Tribune&quot; stated:
In the death of Ouray, one of the historical characters passes away. He has figured for many years as the greatest Indian of his time, and during his life has figured quite prominently. Ouray is in many respects...a remarkable Indian...pure instincts and keen perception. A friend to the white man and protector to the Indians alike.

<text>Banner Records was an American record company and label in the 1920s and 1930s. It was created primarily for the S.S. Kresge Company, though it was employed as a budget label in other discount stores.

==History==
Banner was formed in January 1922 as the flagship label of the Plaza Music Company of New York City. Plaza Music produced several cheap labels targeted at discount houses and hired bandleader Adrian Schubert as musical director. At the beginning, Banner concentrated on popular dance hits, though it also recorded comedy, semi-classical music, and a small number of country and blues records. In its first years Banner also leased masters from Paramount Records and Emerson Records.

In July 1929 Plaza merged with Cameo-Pathé and the Scranton Button Company to form the (ARC). ARC dropped Pathé and Scranton Button&#x27;s label Emerson but kept active all of the other labels belonging to the combined company, including Banner. After ARC acquired the rights to Brunswick Records, Banner&#x27;s product lines began to reflect the general ARC product, and this added more African-American and country music to its catalogue. As part of the ARC-BRC combination, it no longer enjoyed a flagship status accorded to Melotone among the budget labels. Although ARC-BRC dropped some of the dime-store labels, it kept Banner until December 1938, when the CBS Broadcasting Network bought ARC-BRC and liquidated all of the dime-store labels.

In December 1946, entrepreneur Sam Selsman formed a new Banner Records label, devoted to Jewish music and Yiddish-language comedy routines; although this later Banner Records no longer actively records, its catalogue continues. There is no relationship between the Hebrew Banner label and the earlier products of Plaza Music or ARC/BRC; nor is there is a relationship to a dime-store label put out by Leeds and Caitlin in the early 1900s, though the label&#x27;s design is similar.

==Label series==
Banner debuted with two concurrent label series in January 1922: a popular 1000 series side by side with a &quot;Standard&quot; 2000 series of semi-classical music, comedy, and some Jewish material. Reaching Banner 1999 in the main series in mid-1927, Banner skipped ahead to 6000 and terminated the Standard series at the end of the year at Banner 2183. At this point, Banner also stopped the 6000 series at Banner 6167 and moved again to a 7000 series starting at Banner 7001. This ended in early 1929 at Banner 7265 and then reverted to the old series, starting at Banner 6200. The series survived the merger into ARC, but was ended at the start of 1930 at Banner 6566 and restarted at 0500 until it reached 0872 later in the year. The number series was then started again at 32001 and the price changed from 25 cents to 35 cents in order to bring Banner in line with other dime-store labels being sold 3 for a dollar. This lasted until 1935, when the dime-store labels were all married to a central numbering system. But releases were not necessarily unified; for example, Robert Johnson, who did have some releases on Melotone, did not appear on Banner.

==Legacy==
Banner discs are found throughout the United States, indicating their popularity as Plaza&#x27;s flagship label. The audio fidelity of the records was average to slightly below average for the time, but as Banner was a cheap label they were pressed from cheaper materials that did not withstand repeated playing with the heavy phonograph players of the time. Most Banner discs found today exhibit considerable wear and surface noise, but they are still valued by virtue of the selections.

In keeping with their low-price production, it is common for a current hit song on the A-side and a lesser-known song as the B side. Many of these B side songs are eccentric tunes not recorded elsewhere (but, of course, found on the other Plaza/ARC labels). Also scattered around these B sides are tunes by Luis Russell, Duke Ellington, small groups from the Ben Pollack orchestra, among others.

<text>John Newlove (June 13, 1938 – December 23, 2003) was a Canadian poet who was considered to be one of the dominant voices of prairie poetry, though he lived most of his adult life in British Columbia and Ontario.

==Life==
Born in Regina, Saskatchewan, Newlove lived in a variety of small Saskatchewan towns, in particular Kamsack. He attended the University of Saskatchewan for a year, worked briefly as a social worker, a teacher and at a radio station before embarking on a cross-Canada trip which eventually landed him in Vancouver, British Columbia.

He came to prominence in the 1960s as various collections of his poetry were published to critical acclaim. He left Vancouver in May 1967 and took his family to Deep Springs College in California where composer friend Barney Childs was a professor. After several more moves, he and his family ended up in Toronto by 1970 where he worked as senior editor for McClelland and Stewart. It was during this period that he won the 1972 Governor General&#x27;s Award for &quot;Lies.&quot;

Various writer-in-residence stints followed his 1974 departure from McCelland and Stewart, including at Concordia University in Montreal, the University of Toronto and University of Western Ontario in London. He lived for several years in Regina in the early 1980s where he served as writer-in-residence at the public library, then in Nelson, British Columbia, where he taught at David Thompson University. Finally, he moved to Ottawa in 1986 and took a position as an editor with the federal Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages; he would spend the rest of his life in that city.

His 1986 collection, &quot;The Night the Dog Smiled&quot;, was short-listed for that year&#x27;s English language poetry Governor General&#x27;s Award, and he won the 1984 Saskatchewan Writers&#x27; Guild Founders Award.

Newlove suffered a stroke in 2001 and died in 2003.

Newlove was the subject of two documentaries: &quot;New Canadian Writers: John Newlove&quot; (1971) which was broadcast on TVO, and &quot;What to Make of It All? The Life and Poetry of John Newlove&quot; (2006) which was broadcast on Bravo! in 2007.

<text>The Norwegian railway system comprises 4,109 km of (standard gauge) track of which 2,644 km is electrified and 274 km double track. There are 697 tunnels and 2,760 bridges.

The Norwegian Railway Directorate manages the railway network in Norway on behalf of the Ministry of Transportation. Bane NOR is a state enterprise which builds and maintains all railway tracks, while other companies operate them. These companies include Vy and subsidiaries Vy Gjøvikbanen and CargoNet, Flytoget, Go-Ahead, SJ Norge, Green Cargo, Grenland Rail and Hector Rail.

Norway is a member of the International Union of Railways (UIC). The UIC Country Code for Norway is 76.

==History==
The first railway in Norway was the Hoved Line between Oslo and Eidsvoll and opened in 1854. The main purpose of the railway was to move lumber from Mjøsa to the capital, but passenger service was also offered. In the period between the 1860s and the 1880s Norway saw a boom of smaller railways being built, including isolated railways in Central and Western Norway. The predominant gauge at the time was (narrow gauge), but some lines were built in (standard gauge). The height of the era came in 1877 when the Røros Line connected Central Norway to the capital. In 1883 the entire main railway network was taken over by Norwegian State Railways (NSB), though a number of industrial railways and branch lines continued to be operated by private companies.

Three urban railways, in Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim, were started as in 1875 (Oslo), 1897 (Bergen) and Trondheim (1901). Oslo&#x27;s system, as the only one, started with horse cars, the others were electrified from the beginning. Electric cars were introduced in Oslo in 1894 and the last horse car operated in 1900.

Bergen closed down its first generation system between 1944 and 1965, but (re-)introduced light rail transit (LRT) in 2006.

The second construction boom of the main railway arose in the 1910s and included the Bergen Line across Finse to Bergen, connecting Eastern and Western Norway. A number of other larger projects were also built in the 1920s, including a second line, the Dovre Line, to Trondheim. This period also saw the first electrified railways and a steady conversion from narrow gauge to standard gauge. Norway chose to electrify its network at .

During World War II there was a massive construction by the German Forces as part of creating Festung Norwegen, including large sections of the Nordland Line and the completion of the Sørland Line. After the war the main effort was to complete the Nordland Line (which reached Bodø in 1962) and the decision to electrify 50% of the network, a task not completed until 1970. This allowed the retirement of steam locomotives, which were replaced with electric engines like the El 11 and El 13 or the diesel powered Di 3. In 1966 Norway&#x27;s only rapid transit, Oslo T-bane was opened, but in the same decade the Bergen tramway was closed. In the 1970s and 80s many branch lines were also abandoned.

In 1980 the massive project of connecting the eastern and western railway networks around Oslo was completed with the opening of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station. In 1996 NSB was split into the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate, Jernbaneverket and an operating company NSB BA. Since then, the companies have been split into 10 separate corporations. In 1998 the first new line in 36 years was opened when the high-speed Gardermoen Line was opened to allow travel at 210 km/h between Oslo, Oslo Airport and Eidsvoll. The 1990s also saw the massive introduction of multiple units on passenger trains. In the 2000s the freight segment was deregulated and a number of freight companies have started competing with the NSB subsidiary CargoNet.

The national main routes in Norway are considered to be among the slowest in Europe, and slower than parts of East Africa, with average speeds below 80 km/h.

==Network==

===Track===
The main railway network consists of 4,087 km of lines, of which 262 km is double track and 60 km high-speed rail (210 km/h). In addition there is 225 km of urban railways, of which 218 km is double track. In addition there are some industrial tracks and minor branch lines and some abandoned and heritage railways. The entire main network is (standard gauge), as are the urban railways in Oslo and Bergen. Of the operational railways in Norway, only the Trondheim Tramway has a different gauge, the meter gauge, . Some heritage railways, though, operate with various kinds of narrow gauge.

The Kirkenes–Bjørnevatn Line used to be the northernmost railway in the world, but was in 2010 beaten by the Obskaya–Bovanenkovo Line in Russia. Still, Narvik is one of the northernmost towns in the world to have a railway connection, as the terminus for the Ofoten Line. It connects to Kiruna, Sweden, but not to Bodø, the northern terminus of the Norwegian railway network. Kiruna is, however, connected to the Swedish railway network, which again is connected to the Norwegian network at the Swedish stations of Charlottenberg, Storlien and Kornsjø.

===Traction===
2,622 km (64%) of the railway network is electrified, all of it at with overhead wires. The only sections that are not electrified are the lines north of Mjøsa, with the sole exception of the Dovre Line and the Ofoten Line. On non-electrified sections diesel locomotives are used. All of the urban railways use 600 or 750 V DC, via overhead wires on the tramways and via third-rail on the Oslo T-bane.

===Future expansion plans===
In its plans, Bane NOR will concentrate its expansions primarily on the cramped network around Oslo and the larger cities.

*New tunnel under Oslo city center.
*Vestfold Line: A new alignment between Larvik and Porsgrunn ca 23 km, cut 22 minutes of travel time. Double track between Drammen and Tønsberg is under construction and due by 2025. The plan is to make the whole line double tracked from Drammen to Porsgrunn.
*Sørland Line: Plans may include between Porsgrunn and Skorstøl, which would realign trains to southern Norway via Vestfold.
*Østfold Line: The Østfold Line is today double track both north and south of Moss, but in Moss 10 km remains as a single track bottleneck. Plans is to realign the railway through Moss, with double track through two tunnels.
*Ringerike Line is a planned railway between Sandvika and Hønefoss that will reduce travel time between Oslo and Hønefoss/Bergen by 50 minutes. Construction is postponed indefinitely.
*Bergen Line: Double track from Bergen to Arna. Later plans call for double track further east to Stanghelle and Voss.
*Dovre Line: Expanding the rest of the line between Eidsvoll and Hamar to double track by 2027. Realignment of Dovrebanen south of Trondheim may be done together with relocating of Trondheims freight terminal.
*Nordland Line/Meråker Line: Electrifying of the Meråker Line and the Nordland Line up to Stjørdal is planned to be finished by 2024. Later plans may include double tracking between Trondheim and Stjørdal, and a new tunnel between Stjørdal and Levanger.
*The Bergen Light Rail was opened in 2010, and extensions are being built.
*The Oslo T-bane will be expanded, as will the Trondheim tramway.

;High speed rail

The question about building a high-speed railway between the largest Southern Norwegian cities has been discussed at political level, and a report was ready by the end of 2007. Advocates for rail transport and environmentalists have wanted to build high speed railways, including upgrades to 250 km/h on the Sørland Line, Bergen Line, and Dovre Line while others, including Norsk Bane, have suggested construction of a new line through Haukeli to Stavanger, Haugesund and Bergen.

;Platform heights
There are current proposed figures:
* above rail for long-distance trains
* above rail for commuter trains
* above rail for shared platforms
*For or broad gauge lines, passenger platforms shall be as low to above rail should be allowed.

===Heritage===
There are also several operational museum railways in Norway, including the Krøder Line, Setesdal Line, Urskog–Høland Line, Thamshavn Line, Rjukan Line, Valdres Line, Nesttun–Os Railway and Old Voss Line. The Norwegian Railway Museum is located in Hamar and includes exhibits of train hardware, related objects, as well as document and photography archives.

== Railway links with adjacent countries ==
Sweden is the only country with which Norway shares railway borders. Sweden and Norway share gauge, loading gauge, signaling system, electric system, GSM-R and automatic trains stop systems. Most rolling stock can cross the border. There are four border crossings: the Østfold Line–Norway/Vänern Line, the Kongsvinger Line–Värmland Line, the Meråker Line–Central Line and the Ofoten Line–Iron Ore Line. All crossings have electric traction on the Swedish side, but the Meråker Line lacks it on the Norwegian side. There have previously been operational train ferries to Denmark.

There are proposals to connect Northern Norway to Finland (the planned Arctic Railway) and Russia. At Kirkenes, the Kirkenes–Bjørnevatn Line is proposed to be connected to Russia&#x27;s Murmansk–Nikel Railway, and the line is also proposed for connection to the Finnish network in Rovaniemi (there has been a line between Rovaniemi and the Murmansk railway). Russia has generally dismissed this proposal in favour of using Russian ports instead of Kirkenes. Another proposal has been to build a line from Kolari to Skibotn and Tromsø, even if connecting to the existing line to Narvik is the main suggestion.

==Operation==

===Railway companies===
Traditionally, all trains were operated by Vy (formerly NSB), but the deregulation in the 2000s has led to the introduction of a number of new freight operators, including CargoNet, Hector Rail, Tågåkeriet and Ofoten Line. The conservative-liberal government tried to introduce public service obligation bids on subsidized passenger routes in 2005, but the contract was won by the NSB subsidiary NSB Anbud and the following red-green government has cancelled further PSO contracting. Also the Airport Express Train has been made a separate company.

In 2017 Norway&#x27;s Ministry of Transport and Communications decided to develop tenders for the operation of passenger rail services. On 4 February 2018, it launched a tender to deliver Traffic Package 1 that will commence on 15 December 2019, comprising long-distance services on the Sørlandet Line from Oslo to Stavanger. In October 2018 this package was awarded to Go-Ahead Nordic.

In March 2018, the Norwegian Railway Directorate launched tenders for Traffic Package 2, passenger services on the Røros Line, Meråker Line, Rauma Line, and Nordland Line, plus regional services in Trøndelag county. SJ will commence operating the package on 7 June 2020.

On 21 December 2018, the Norwegian Railway Directorate launched tenders for Traffic Package 3, passenger services on the Oslo to Bergen line starting on 13 December 2020.
===Passenger services===


===Passenger rolling stock===
Until the 1990s only commuter and regional trains were operated with multiple units, but since then Vy has ordered numerous multiple units for its regional and express lines. Express trains are operated with 16 BM 73 units with tilting technology, regional trains with 16 BM 70, 6 BM 73b (both electric) and 15 BM 93 (diesel) units while the local trains are operated by 71 BM 69 and 36 BM 72 (both electric) while the local trains around Trondheim, Trøndelag Commuter Rail, uses 14 BM 92 diesel multiple unit. The Airport Express Train uses 16 BM 71 and Vy Gjøvikbanen operates 9 BM 69g units. The Ofoten Line operates three BM 68 electric multiple units.

Vy still uses locomotive hauled passenger trains on a few of the long-distance lines. For this task they use 22 El 18s and 5 Di 4s in addition to six El 17 on the Flåm Line. Most of the cars are B7 on long-distance services and B5 on regional services. Most of the locomotives have been transferred to the freight division CargoNet.

===Freight rolling stock===
CargoNet uses a combination of 30 El 14, 15 El 16, 19 Di 8 and 6 CD66. The other companies use stock retired by NSB, including the Ofoten Line&#x27;s 7 El 13, 5 Di 3 and 2 T43, HectorRail&#x27;s 6 El 15 (now known as 161) and Tåkåkeriet&#x27;s Rc2.

<text>Biometrics are body measurements and calculations related to human characteristics and features. Biometric authentication (or realistic authentication) is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control. It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under surveillance.

Biometric identifiers are the distinctive, measurable characteristics used to label and describe individuals. Biometric identifiers are often categorized as physiological characteristics which are related to the shape of the body. Examples include, but are not limited to fingerprint, palm veins, face recognition, DNA, palm print, hand geometry, iris recognition, retina, odor/scent, voice, shape of ears and gait. Behavioral characteristics are related to the pattern of behavior of a person, including but not limited to mouse movement, typing rhythm, gait, signature, voice, and behavioral profiling. Some researchers have coined the term behaviometrics (behavioral biometrics) to describe the latter class of biometrics.

More traditional means of access control include token-based identification systems, such as a driver&#x27;s license or passport, and knowledge-based identification systems, such as a password or personal identification number. Since biometric identifiers are unique to individuals, they are more reliable in verifying identity than token and knowledge-based methods; however, the collection of biometric identifiers raises privacy concerns. 

==Biometric functionality==
Many different aspects of human physiology, chemistry or behavior can be used for biometric authentication. The selection of a particular biometric for use in a specific application involves a weighting of several factors. Jain &quot;et al.&quot; (1999) identified seven such factors to be used when assessing the suitability of any trait for use in biometric authentication. Biometric authentication is based upon biometric recognition which is an advanced method of recognising biological and behavioural characteristics of an Individual. 
* Universality means that every person using a system should possess the trait.
*Uniqueness means the trait should be sufficiently different for individuals in the relevant population such that they can be distinguished from one another.
* Permanence relates to the manner in which a trait varies over time. More specifically, a trait with &quot;good&quot; permanence will be reasonably invariant over time with respect to the specific matching algorithm.
* Measurability (collectability) relates to the ease of acquisition or measurement of the trait. In addition, acquired data should be in a form that permits subsequent processing and extraction of the relevant feature sets. 
* Performance relates to the accuracy, speed, and robustness of technology used (see performance section for more details). 
* Acceptability relates to how well individuals in the relevant population accept the technology such that they are willing to have their biometric trait captured and assessed. 
* Circumvention relates to the ease with which a trait might be imitated using an artifact or substitute.

Proper biometric use is very application dependent. Certain biometrics will be better than others based on the required levels of convenience and security. No single biometric will meet all the requirements of every possible application.

The block diagram illustrates the two basic modes of a biometric system. First, in verification (or authentication) mode the system performs a one-to-one comparison of a captured biometric with a specific template stored in a biometric database in order to verify the individual is the person they claim to be. Three steps are involved in the verification of a person. In the first step, reference models for all the users are generated and stored in the model database. In the second step, some samples are matched with reference models to generate the genuine and impostor scores and calculate the threshold. The third step is the testing step. This process may use a smart card, username, or ID number (e.g. PIN) to indicate which template should be used for comparison. &quot;Positive recognition&quot; is a common use of the verification mode, &quot;where the aim is to prevent multiple people from using the same identity&quot;.
Second, in identification mode the system performs a one-to-many comparison against a biometric database in an attempt to establish the identity of an unknown individual. The system will succeed in identifying the individual if the comparison of the biometric sample to a template in the database falls within a previously set threshold. Identification mode can be used either for &quot;positive recognition&quot; (so that the user does not have to provide any information about the template to be used) or for &quot;negative recognition&quot; of the person &quot;where the system establishes whether the person is who she (implicitly or explicitly) denies to be&quot;. The latter function can only be achieved through biometrics since other methods of personal recognition, such as passwords, PINs, or keys, are ineffective.

The first time an individual uses a biometric system is called &quot;enrollment&quot;. During enrollment, biometric information from an individual is captured and stored. In subsequent uses, biometric information is detected and compared with the information stored at the time of enrollment. Note that it is crucial that storage and retrieval of such systems themselves be secure if the biometric system is to be robust. The first block (sensor) is the interface between the real world and the system; it has to acquire all the necessary data. Most of the times it is an image acquisition system, but it can change according to the characteristics desired. The second block performs all the necessary pre-processing: it has to remove artifacts from the sensor, to enhance the input (e.g. removing background noise), to use some kind of normalization, etc. In the third block, necessary features are extracted. This step is an important step as the correct features need to be extracted in an optimal way. A vector of numbers or an image with particular properties is used to create a &quot;template&quot;. A template is a synthesis of the relevant characteristics extracted from the source. Elements of the biometric measurement that are not used in the comparison algorithm are discarded in the template to reduce the file size and to protect the identity of the enrollee. However, depending on the scope of the biometric system, original biometric image sources may be retained, such as the PIV-cards used in the Federal Information Processing Standard Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors (FIPS 201).

During the enrollment phase, the template is simply stored somewhere (on a card or within a database or both). During the matching phase, the obtained template is passed to a matcher that compares it with other existing templates, estimating the distance between them using any algorithm (e.g. Hamming distance). The matching program will analyze the template with the input. This will then be output for a specified use or purpose (e.g. entrance in a restricted area), though it is a fear that the use of biometric data may face mission creep.
Selection of biometrics in any practical application depending upon the characteristic measurements and user requirements. In selecting a particular biometric, factors to consider include, performance, social acceptability, ease of circumvention and/or spoofing, robustness, population coverage, size of equipment needed and identity theft deterrence. The selection of a biometric is based on user requirements and considers sensor and device availability, computational time and reliability, cost, sensor size, and power consumption.

==Multimodal biometric system==
Multimodal biometric systems use multiple sensors or biometrics to overcome the limitations of unimodal biometric systems. For instance iris recognition systems can be compromised by aging irises and electronic fingerprint recognition can be worsened by worn-out or cut fingerprints. While unimodal biometric systems are limited by the integrity of their identifier, it is unlikely that several unimodal systems will suffer from identical limitations. Multimodal biometric systems can obtain sets of information from the same marker (i.e., multiple images of an iris, or scans of the same finger) or information from different biometrics (requiring fingerprint scans and, using voice recognition, a spoken passcode).

Multimodal biometric systems can fuse these unimodal systems sequentially, simultaneously, a combination thereof, or in series, which refer to sequential, parallel, hierarchical and serial integration modes, respectively.
Fusion of the biometrics information can occur at different stages of a recognition system. In case of feature level fusion, the data itself or the features extracted from multiple biometrics are fused. Matching-score level fusion consolidates the scores generated by multiple classifiers pertaining to different modalities. Finally, in case of decision level fusion the final results of multiple classifiers are combined via techniques such as majority voting. Feature level fusion is believed to be more effective than the other levels of fusion because the feature set contains richer information about the input biometric data than the matching score or the output decision of a classifier. Therefore, fusion at the feature level is expected to provide better recognition results.

Furthermore, the evolving biometric market trends underscore the importance of technological integration, showcasing a shift towards combining multiple biometric modalities for enhanced security and identity verification, aligning with the advancements in multimodal biometric systems.

Spoof attacks consist in submitting fake biometric traits to biometric systems, and are a major threat that can curtail their security. Multi-modal biometric systems are commonly believed to be intrinsically more robust to spoof attacks, but recent studies have shown that they can be evaded by spoofing even a single biometric trait.

One such proposed system of Multimodal Biometric Cryptosystem Involving the Face, Fingerprint, and Palm Vein by Prasanalakshmi The Cryptosystem Integration combines biometrics with cryptography, where the palm vein acts as a cryptographic key, offering a high level of security since palm veins are unique and difficult to forge. The Fingerprint Involves minutiae extraction (terminations and bifurcations) and matching techniques. Steps include image enhancement, binarization, ROI extraction, and minutiae thinning. The Face system uses class-based scatter matrices to calculate features for recognition, and the Palm Vein acts as an unbreakable cryptographic key, ensuring only the correct user can access the system. The cancelable Biometrics concept allows biometric traits to be altered slightly to ensure privacy and avoid theft. If compromised, new variations of biometric data can be issued.
The Encryption fingerprint template is encrypted using the palm vein key via XOR operations. This encrypted Fingerprint is hidden within the face image using steganographic techniques. Enrollment and Verification for the Biometric data (Fingerprint, palm vein, face) are captured, encrypted, and embedded into a face image. The system extracts the biometric data and compares it with stored values for Verification. The system was tested with fingerprint databases, achieving 75% verification accuracy at an equal error rate of 25% and processing time approximately 50 seconds for enrollment and 22 seconds for Verification. High security due to palm vein encryption, effective against biometric spoofing, and the multimodal approach ensures reliability if one biometric fails. Potential for integration with smart cards or on-card systems, enhancing security in personal identification systems.

==Performance==
The discriminating powers of all biometric technologies depend on the amount of entropy they are able to encode and use in matching. 
The following are used as performance metrics for biometric systems:
* False match rate (FMR, also called FAR = False Accept Rate): the probability that the system incorrectly matches the input pattern to a non-matching template in the database. It measures the percent of invalid inputs that are incorrectly accepted. In case of similarity scale, if the person is an imposter in reality, but the matching score is higher than the threshold, then he is treated as genuine. This increases the FMR, which thus also depends upon the threshold value.
* False non-match rate (FNMR, also called FRR = False Reject Rate): the probability that the system fails to detect a match between the input pattern and a matching template in the database. It measures the percent of valid inputs that are incorrectly rejected.
* Receiver operating characteristic or relative operating characteristic (ROC): The ROC plot is a visual characterization of the trade-off between the FMR and the FNMR. In general, the matching algorithm performs a decision based on a threshold that determines how close to a template the input needs to be for it to be considered a match. If the threshold is reduced, there will be fewer false non-matches but more false accepts. Conversely, a higher threshold will reduce the FMR but increase the FNMR. A common variation is the &quot;Detection error trade-off (DET)&quot;, which is obtained using normal deviation scales on both axes. This more linear graph illuminates the differences for higher performances (rarer errors).
* Equal error rate or crossover error rate (EER or CER): the rate at which both acceptance and rejection errors are equal. The value of the EER can be easily obtained from the ROC curve. The EER is a quick way to compare the accuracy of devices with different ROC curves. In general, the device with the lowest EER is the most accurate.
* Failure to enroll rate (FTE or FER): the rate at which attempts to create a template from an input is unsuccessful. This is most commonly caused by low-quality inputs.
* Failure to capture rate (FTC): Within automatic systems, the probability that the system fails to detect a biometric input when presented correctly.
* Template capacity: the maximum number of sets of data that can be stored in the system.

==History==
An early cataloguing of fingerprints dates back to 1885 when Juan Vucetich started a collection of fingerprints of criminals in Argentina. Josh Ellenbogen and Nitzan Lebovic argued that Biometrics originated in the identification systems of criminal activity developed by Alphonse Bertillon (1853–1914) and by Francis Galton&#x27;s theory of fingerprints and physiognomy. According to Lebovic, Galton&#x27;s work &quot;led to the application of mathematical models to fingerprints, phrenology, and facial characteristics&quot;, as part of &quot;absolute identification&quot; and &quot;a key to both inclusion and exclusion&quot; of populations. Accordingly, &quot;the biometric system is the absolute political weapon of our era&quot; and a form of &quot;soft control&quot;. The theoretician David Lyon showed that during the past two decades biometric systems have penetrated the civilian market, and blurred the lines between governmental forms of control and private corporate control. Kelly A. Gates identified 9/11 as the turning point for the cultural language of our present: &quot;in the language of cultural studies, the aftermath of 9/11 was a moment of articulation, where objects or events that have no necessary connection come together and a new discourse formation is established: automated facial recognition as a homeland security technology.&quot;

==Adaptive biometric systems==
Adaptive biometric systems aim to auto-update the templates or model to the intra-class variation of the operational data. The two-fold advantages of these systems are solving the problem of limited training data and tracking the temporal variations of the input data through adaptation. Recently, adaptive biometrics have received a significant attention from the research community. This research direction is expected to gain momentum because of their key promulgated advantages. First, with an adaptive biometric system, one no longer needs to collect a large number of biometric samples during the enrollment process. Second, it is no longer necessary to enroll again or retrain the system from scratch in order to cope with the changing environment. This convenience can significantly reduce the cost of maintaining a biometric system. Despite these advantages, there are several open issues involved with these systems. For mis-classification error (false acceptance) by the biometric system, cause adaptation using impostor sample. However, continuous research efforts are directed to resolve the open issues associated to the field of adaptive biometrics. More information about adaptive biometric systems can be found in the critical review by Rattani &quot;et al.&quot;

==Recent advances in emerging biometrics==
In recent times, biometrics based on brain (electroencephalogram) and heart (electrocardiogram) signals have emerged. An example is finger vein recognition, using pattern-recognition techniques, based on images of human vascular patterns. The advantage of this newer technology is that it is more fraud resistant compared to conventional biometrics like fingerprints. However, such technology is generally more cumbersome and still has issues such as lower accuracy and poor reproducibility over time.

On the portability side of biometric products, more and more vendors are embracing significantly miniaturized biometric authentication systems (BAS) thereby driving elaborate cost savings, especially for large-scale deployments.

===Operator signatures===
An operator signature is a biometric mode where the manner in which a person using a device or complex system is recorded as a verification template. One potential use for this type of biometric signature is to distinguish among remote users of telerobotic surgery systems that utilize public networks for communication.

=== Proposed requirement for certain public networks ===
John Michael (Mike) McConnell, a former vice admiral in the United States Navy, a former director of U.S. National Intelligence, and senior vice president of Booz Allen Hamilton, promoted the development of a future capability to require biometric authentication to access certain public networks in his keynote speech at the 2009 Biometric Consortium Conference.

A basic premise in the above proposal is that the person that has uniquely authenticated themselves using biometrics with the computer is in fact also the agent performing potentially malicious actions from that computer. However, if control of the computer has been subverted, for example in which the computer is part of a botnet controlled by a hacker, then knowledge of the identity of the user at the terminal does not materially improve network security or aid law enforcement activities.

===Animal biometrics===
Rather than tags or tattoos, biometric techniques may be used to identify individual animals: zebra stripes, blood vessel patterns in rodent ears, muzzle prints, bat wing patterns, primate facial recognition and koala spots have all been tried.

==Issues and concerns==
===Human dignity===
Biometrics have been considered also instrumental to the development of state authority (to put it in Foucauldian terms, of discipline and biopower). By turning the human subject into a collection of biometric parameters, biometrics would dehumanize the person, infringe bodily integrity, and, ultimately, offend human dignity.

In a well-known case, Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben refused to enter the United States in protest at the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator (US-VISIT) program&#x27;s requirement for visitors to be fingerprinted and photographed. Agamben argued that gathering of biometric data is a form of bio-political tattooing, akin to the tattooing of Jews during the Holocaust. According to Agamben, biometrics turn the human persona into a bare body. Agamben refers to the two words used by Ancient Greeks for indicating &quot;life&quot;, &quot;zoe&quot;, which is the life common to animals and humans, just life; and &quot;bios&quot;, which is life in the human context, with meanings and purposes. Agamben envisages the reduction to bare bodies for the whole humanity. For him, a new bio-political relationship between citizens and the state is turning citizens into pure biological life (&quot;zoe&quot;) depriving them from their humanity (&quot;bios&quot;); and biometrics would herald this new world.

In Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness, surveillance scholar Simone Browne formulates a similar critique as Agamben, citing a recent study relating to biometrics R&amp;D that found that the gender classification system being researched &quot;is inclined to classify Africans as males and Mongoloids as females.&quot; Consequently, Browne argues that the conception of an objective biometric technology is difficult if such systems are subjectively designed, and are vulnerable to cause errors as described in the study above. The stark expansion of biometric technologies in both the public and private sector magnifies this concern. The increasing commodification of biometrics by the private sector adds to this danger of loss of human value. Indeed, corporations value the biometric characteristics more than the individuals value them. Browne goes on to suggest that modern society should incorporate a &quot;biometric consciousness&quot; that &quot;entails informed public debate around these technologies and their application, and accountability by the state and the private sector, where the ownership of and access to one&#x27;s own body data and other intellectual property that is generated from one&#x27;s body data must be understood as a right.&quot;

Other scholars have emphasized, however, that the globalized world is confronted with a huge mass of people with weak or absent civil identities. Most developing countries have weak and unreliable documents and the poorer people in these countries do not have even those unreliable documents. Without certified personal identities, there is no certainty of right, no civil liberty. One can claim his rights, including the right to refuse to be identified, only if he is an identifiable subject, if he has a public identity. In such a sense, biometrics could play a pivotal role in supporting and promoting respect for human dignity and fundamental rights.

===Privacy and discrimination===

It is possible that data obtained during biometric enrollment may be used in ways for which the enrolled individual has not consented. For example, most biometric features could disclose physiological and/or pathological medical conditions (e.g., some fingerprint patterns are related to chromosomal diseases, iris patterns could reveal sex, hand vein patterns could reveal vascular diseases, most behavioral biometrics could reveal neurological diseases, etc.). Moreover, second generation biometrics, notably behavioral and electro-physiologic biometrics (e.g., based on electrocardiography, electroencephalography, electromyography), could be also used for emotion detection.

There are three categories of privacy concerns:
# Unintended functional scope: The authentication goes further than authentication, such as finding a tumor.
# Unintended application scope: The authentication process correctly identifies the subject when the subject did not wish to be identified.
# Covert identification: The subject is identified without seeking identification or authentication, i.e. a subject&#x27;s face is identified in a crowd.

===Danger to owners of secured items===
When thieves cannot get access to secure properties, there is a chance that the thieves will stalk and assault the property owner to gain access. If the item is secured with a biometric device, the damage to the owner could be irreversible, and potentially cost more than the secured property. For example, in 2005, Malaysian car thieves cut off a man&#x27;s finger when attempting to steal his Mercedes-Benz S-Class.

===Attacks at presentation===
In the context of biometric systems, presentation attacks may also be called &quot;spoofing attacks&quot;.

As per the recent ISO/IEC 30107 standard, presentation attacks are defined as &quot;presentation to the biometric capture subsystem with the goal of interfering with the operation of the biometric system&quot;. These attacks can be either impersonation or obfuscation attacks. Impersonation attacks try to gain access by pretending to be someone else. Obfuscation attacks may, for example, try to evade face detection and face recognition systems.

Several methods have been proposed to counteract presentation attacks.

===Surveillance humanitarianism in times of crisis===
Biometrics are employed by many aid programs in times of crisis in order to prevent fraud and ensure that resources are properly available to those in need. Humanitarian efforts are motivated by promoting the welfare of individuals in need, however the use of biometrics as a form of surveillance humanitarianism can create conflict due to varying interests of the groups involved in the particular situation. Disputes over the use of biometrics between aid programs and party officials stalls the distribution of resources to people that need help the most. In July 2019, the United Nations World Food Program and Houthi Rebels were involved in a large dispute over the use of biometrics to ensure resources are provided to the hundreds of thousands of civilians in Yemen whose lives are threatened. The refusal to cooperate with the interests of the United Nations World Food Program resulted in the suspension of food aid to the Yemen population. The use of biometrics may provide aid programs with valuable information, however its potential solutions may not be best suited for chaotic times of crisis. Conflicts that are caused by deep-rooted political problems, in which the implementation of biometrics may not provide a long-term solution.

===Cancelable biometrics===
One advantage of passwords over biometrics is that they can be re-issued. If a token or a password is lost or stolen, it can be cancelled and replaced by a newer version. This is not naturally available in biometrics. If someone&#x27;s face is compromised from a database, they cannot cancel or reissue it. If the electronic biometric identifier is stolen, it is nearly impossible to change a biometric feature. This renders the person&#x27;s biometric feature questionable for future use in authentication, such as the case with the hacking of security-clearance-related background information from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in the United States.

Cancelable biometrics is a way in which to incorporate protection and the replacement features into biometrics to create a more secure system. It was first proposed by Ratha &quot;et al.&quot;

&quot;Cancelable biometrics refers to the intentional and systematically repeatable distortion of biometric features in order to protect sensitive user-specific data. If a cancelable feature is compromised, the distortion characteristics are changed, and the same biometrics is mapped to a new template, which is used subsequently. Cancelable biometrics is one of the major categories for biometric template protection purpose besides biometric cryptosystem.&quot; In biometric cryptosystem, &quot;the error-correcting coding techniques are employed to handle intraclass variations.&quot; This ensures a high level of security but has limitations such as specific input format of only small intraclass variations.

Several methods for generating new exclusive biometrics have been proposed. The first fingerprint-based cancelable biometric system was designed and developed by Tulyakov &quot;et al.&quot; Essentially, cancelable biometrics perform a distortion of the biometric image or features before matching. The variability in the distortion parameters provides the cancelable nature of the scheme. Some of the proposed techniques operate using their own recognition engines, such as Teoh &quot;et al.&quot; and Savvides &quot;et al.&quot;, whereas other methods, such as Dabbah &quot;et al.&quot;, take the advantage of the advancement of the well-established biometric research for their recognition front-end to conduct recognition. Although this increases the restrictions on the protection system, it makes the cancellable templates more accessible for available biometric technologies

===Proposed soft biometrics===
Soft biometrics are understood as not strict biometrical recognition practices that are proposed in favour of identity cheaters and stealers.

Traits are physical, behavioral or adhered human characteristics that have been derived from the way human beings normally distinguish their peers (e.g. height, gender, hair color). They are used to complement the identity information provided by the primary biometric identifiers. Although soft biometric characteristics lack the distinctiveness and permanence to recognize an individual uniquely and reliably, and can be easily faked, they provide some evidence about the users identity that could be beneficial. In other words, despite the fact they are unable to individualize a subject, they are effective in distinguishing between people. Combinations of personal attributes like gender, race, eye color, height and other visible identification marks can be used to improve the performance of traditional biometric systems. Most soft biometrics can be easily collected and are actually collected during enrollment. Two main ethical issues are raised by soft biometrics. First, some of soft biometric traits are strongly cultural based; e.g., skin colors for determining ethnicity risk to support racist approaches, biometric sex recognition at the best recognizes gender from tertiary sexual characters, being unable to determine genetic and chromosomal sexes; soft biometrics for aging recognition are often deeply influenced by ageist stereotypes, etc. Second, soft biometrics have strong potential for categorizing and profiling people, so risking of supporting processes of stigmatization and exclusion.

===Data protection of biometric data in international law===
Many countries, including the United States, are planning to share biometric data with other nations.

In testimony before the US House Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on Homeland Security on &quot;biometric identification&quot; in 2009, Kathleen Kraninger and Robert A Mocny commented on international cooperation and collaboration with respect to biometric data, as follows:
According to an article written in 2009 by S. Magnuson in the National Defense Magazine entitled &quot;Defense Department Under Pressure to Share Biometric Data&quot; the United States has bilateral agreements with other nations aimed at sharing biometric data. To quote that article:
===Likelihood of full governmental disclosure===
Certain members of the civilian community are worried about how biometric data is used but full disclosure may not be forthcoming. In particular, the Unclassified Report of the United States&#x27; Defense Science Board Task Force on Defense Biometrics states that it is wise to protect, and sometimes even to disguise, the true and total extent of national capabilities in areas related directly to the conduct of security-related activities. This also potentially applies to Biometrics. It goes on to say that this is a classic feature of intelligence and military operations. In short, the goal is to preserve the security of &#x27;sources and methods&#x27;.

===Data security===
The frequent use of biometric authentication for security and the permanence of an individuals biometrics make the security of biometric data crucial. 
====Events where biometric data was compromised====
* Office of Personnel Management data breach in 2015
* Biostar 2 fingerprints leak in 2019
* Taliban seizure of US biometric data in 2021 
* Afghan &amp; Iraqi Fingerprints and Iris database
====Legislation and governmental Action====
Biometrics are considered personal information/data under multiple laws
* GDPR in the European Union became law in 2018
* LGPD in Brazil became law in 2020
* Protection of Personal Information Act in South Africa came into force in 2020
* Personal Data Protection Act in Sri Lanka implementation started in 2023
=====United States=====
The United States does not have a nationwide data privacy law that includes biometrics. Several states and local governments, led by the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, have legislation regarding biometric data. The FTC has also taken actions to protect biometric data including against Facebook in 2019, charging they misrepresented their uses of facial recognition technology. 

==Countries applying biometrics==

Countries using biometrics include Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Greece, China, Gambia, Germany, India, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States and Venezuela.

Among low to middle income countries, roughly 1.2 billion people have already received identification through a biometric identification program.

There are also numerous countries applying biometrics for voter registration and similar electoral purposes. According to the International IDEA&#x27;s ICTs in Elections Database, some of the countries using (2017) Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) are Armenia, Angola, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chad, Colombia, Comoros, Congo (Democratic Republic of), Costa Rica, Ivory Coast, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Gambia, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Iraq, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somaliland, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Uruguay, Venezuela, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

=== India&#x27;s national ID program ===
India&#x27;s national ID program called Aadhaar is the largest biometric database in the world. It is a biometrics-based digital identity assigned for a person&#x27;s lifetime, verifiable online instantly in the public domain, at any time, from anywhere, in a paperless way. It is designed to enable government agencies to deliver a retail public service, securely based on biometric data (fingerprint, iris scan and face photo), along with demographic data (name, age, gender, address, parent/spouse name, mobile phone number) of a person. The data is transmitted in encrypted form over the internet for authentication, aiming to free it from the limitations of physical presence of a person at a given place.

About 550 million residents have been enrolled and assigned 480 million Aadhaar national identification numbers as of 7 November 2013. It aims to cover the entire population of 1.2 billion in a few years. However, it is being challenged by critics over privacy concerns and possible transformation of the state into a surveillance state, or into a Banana republic.§ The project was also met with mistrust regarding the safety of the social protection infrastructures. To tackle the fear amongst the people, India&#x27;s supreme court put a new ruling into action that stated that privacy from then on was seen as a fundamental right. On 24 August 2017 this new law was established.

=== Malaysia&#x27;s MyKad national ID program ===
The current identity card, known as MyKad, was introduced by the National Registration Department of Malaysia on 5 September 2001 with Malaysia becoming the first country in the world to use an identification card that incorporates both photo identification and fingerprint biometric data on a built-in computer chip embedded in a piece of plastic.

Besides the main purpose of the card as a validation tool and proof of citizenship other than the birth certificate, MyKad also serves as a valid driver&#x27;s license, an ATM card, an electronic purse, and a public key, among other applications, as part of the Malaysian Government Multipurpose Card (GMPC) initiative, if the bearer chooses to activate the functions.

Scribus is written in Qt and released under the GNU General Public License. There are native versions available for Unix, Linux, BSD, macOS, Haiku, Microsoft Windows, OS/2 (including ArcaOS and eComStation) operating systems.

==General feature overview==
Scribus supports most major bitmap formats, including TIFF, JPEG, and PSD. Vector drawings can be imported or directly opened for editing. The long list of supported formats includes Encapsulated PostScript, SVG, Adobe Illustrator, and Xfig. Professional type/image-setting features include CMYK colors and ICC color management. It has a built-in scripting engine using Python. It is available in 60 languages.

High-level printing is achieved using its own internal level 3 PostScript driver, including support for font embedding and sub-setting with TrueType, Type 1, and OpenType fonts. The internal driver supports full Level 2 PostScript constructs and a large subset of Level 3 constructs.

PDF support includes transparency, encryption, and a large set of the PDF 1.5 specification including layers (OCG), as well as PDF/X-3, including interactive PDFs form fields, annotations, and bookmarks.

The current file format, called SLA, is XML. Old versions of SLA were based on XML. Text can be imported from OpenDocument (ODT) text documents (such as from LibreOffice Writer), OpenOffice.org XML (OpenOffice.org Writer&#x27;s SXW files), Microsoft Word&#x27;s DOC, PDB, and HTML formats (although some limitations apply). ODT files can typically be imported along with their paragraph styles, which are then created in Scribus. HTML tags which modify text, such as bold and &quot;italic&quot;, are supported. Word and PDB documents are only imported as plain text.

ScribusGenerator is a mail merge-like extension to Scribus.

===Scribus 1.6 (and the 1.5 development branch)===
Scribus 1.5.1 added PDF/X-4 support.

Initially, Scribus did not properly support complex script rendering and so could not be used with Unicode text for languages written in Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, and Southeast Asian writing systems, even though it supported Unicode character encoding. In August 2012, it was announced that a third party had developed a system to support complex Indic scripts. In May 2015 it was announced that the ScribusCTL project had started to improve complex layout by integrating the OpenType text-shaping engine HarfBuzz into the official Scribus 1.5.1svn branch. In July 2016 it was announced that the text layout engine had been rewritten from scratch in preparation for support of complex scripts coming in Scribus 1.5.3 and later. In December 2016 Scribus announced they got support for OpenType advanced feature in 1.5.3svn, as well as complex script and RTL direction.

Scribus 1.4.7 did not have OpenType alternative glyph support, so ligatures, for example, were not inserted automatically; this became available from v1.5.3.

==Support for other programs and formats==
Scribus cannot read or write the native file formats of other desktop publishing programs such as QuarkXPress or InDesign; the developers consider that reverse engineering those file formats would be prohibitively complex and could risk legal action from the makers of those programs.

Due to licensing issues, the software package does not include support for the Pantone color matching system (PMS), which is included in some commercial desktop publishing applications. Pantone colors can be obtained and incorporated within Scribus without licensing issues. Scribus is shipped with more than 100 color palettes, most donated by various commercial color vendors, but also including scientific, national, and government color standards.

===Scribus 1.6 (and the 1.5 development branch)===
Support for importing Microsoft Publisher is incorporated into version 1.5, and QuarkXPress Tag files, InDesign&#x27;s IDML, as well as InCopy&#x27;s ICML formats were added to the development branch.

Scribus 1.5.3 onwards contains more than 300 color palettes.

German Organisation freieFarbe e.V. built last HLC Colour Atlas for real colours based on CIELAB. This free Colour Palette is also available in Scribus 1.5.4+.

Scribus 1.5.6 supports native PDF export with embedded open type fonts and PDF 1.6. Python 3 is now default in scripts.
Scribus 1.5.7 improves undo and redo action. Qt 5.14 is new base for compilation and 3rd party components have newer versions.
Next version is 1.5.8 as perhaps last step before 1.6.0.

From view of developers Version 1.5.7 is stable. There are no new versions in pipe with backports for the 1.4 tree with the near end of Qt4 support in most systems.

Scribus 1.5.8 supports full Python 3 support also for MacOS and modern UI features like Dark Mode.

==Books==
Books about Scribus are available in several languages, as is a manual for using Scribus 1.3 in desktop publishing.

==Significant users==
&quot;Janayugom&quot;, a Malayalam daily newspaper in Kerala, India, migrated all desktop publishing to Scribus and Gimp in November 2019, saving over 10 million Indian rupees (approximately US$130,000).

<doc id="290626" wikidata="Q7160455" url="?curid=290626" title="Peerless Records">
<text>Peerless Records was a record label based in Mexico.

Peerless was founded in 1921 in Mexico City by E. Baptista. Early pressings of their gramophone record were made under contract by Gennett Records. By 1933, Peerless was pressing its own records in Mexico. The Peerless label mostly released popular Mexican music; some popular dance bands and tunes from the United States of America also appeared on Peerless in the 1920s.

In addition to Mexico, Peerless Records were sold in other parts of Latin America and in some communities in the Southwest United States. The labels sometimes have text in both English and Spanish.

Peerless was considered a &quot;major label&quot; in Mexico during the 1940s and 1950s.

Peerless issued long-playing vinyl records starting in 1951. During the years, Peerless has been the record label for many well-known artists, such as Pedro Infante, Los Apson, Los Baby&#x27;s, Lola Beltran and David Záizar. It also secured Mexican distribution for some artists from beyond Mexico, such as Los Corraleros de Majagual, Celia Cruz, Tom Jones and The Rolling Stones. Peerless remained an independent label until 2001, when it merged with its subsidiary MCM (Metro Casa Musical), becoming Peerless-MCM S.A. de C.V., which was later bought by Warner Music Mexico.

<text>U.S. Route 93 (US 93) is a major north–south U.S. Numbered Highway in the western United States, that connects U.S. Route 60 (US 60) in Wickenburg, Arizona, with British Columbia Highway 93 at the Canadian border (north of Eureka, Montana). The highway passes through Kingman, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; Twin Falls, Idaho; and Missoula, Montana.

==Route description==

===Arizona===
US 93 begins at US 60 in Wickenburg, a small town approximately northwest of Phoenix. northwest of Wickenburg, US 93 passes through a large forest of Joshua trees and is thus labeled the Joshua Forest Parkway of Arizona until it reaches Wikieup.

From there, it heads north, eventually merging with Interstate 40 (I-40) to head west to Kingman. US 93 then splits from I-40 in Kingman and heads north to the Hoover Dam. Chloride is located off this highway, and Santa Claus is on the western side, about before the Chloride Road intersection.

This highway was known to be one of the deadliest routes in America until recently. The years of improvements have made it a much safer road to travel, according to the Federal Highway Administration.

===Nevada===

US 93 enters Nevada where Interstate 11 (I-11) currently begins: on the Hoover Dam Bypass. I-11 / US 93 then winds its way west-southwest through Boulder City before merging with U.S. Route 95 (US 95) past the interchange with Nevada State Route 173. These three routes (I-11 / US 93 / US 95) then curve northwest toward Las Vegas. US 93 exits at the Las Vegas Spaghetti Bowl interchange just northwest of downtown, heading northbound concurrently with Interstate 15 (I-15). Those two routes then run in a northeasterly direction through North Las Vegas until they exit the metro area, where US 93 diverges from I-15 at Apex to head north toward Great Basin National Park. Near there, the highway joins with the combined US Routes U.S. Route 6 / U.S. Route 50 (US 6 / US 50) to run northwest toward Ely. In Ely, US 6 first departs and heads west toward Tonopah. Then, shortly thereafter, US 50 departs US 93 to continue west toward Fallon and Reno (via U.S. Route 50 Alternate west, U.S. Route 95 Alternate north, and Interstate 80 [I-80] west) and Carson City. Upon reaching Lages Station, U.S. Route 93 Alternate (US 93 Alt) splits off in a northeasterly direction toward West Wendover. The main route of US 93 continues north from Lages Station, intersecting I-80 at Wells before crossing the Idaho state line on the north edge of Jackpot.

Between State Route 318 and Majors Junction (US 6 / US 50), US 93 is designated a Nevada Scenic Byway. From Ely to Schellbourne Ranch, US 93 is part of the Lincoln Highway, the first road across the United States.

===Idaho===

Shortly after entering Idaho, US 93 crosses U.S. Route 30 as it before running through the northern edge Twin Falls. North of here, the highway crosses the Snake River Canyon via the Perrine Bridge en route to an interchange with Interstate 84. US 93 passes through Shoshone and runs concurrently with U.S. Route 20 / U.S. Route 26 (US 20 / US 26) before reaching Arco. The highway then turns northwest (leaving US 20 / US 26) to enter the Big Lost River valley through Mackay.

Just south of Challis, US 93 becomes the northern leg of the &quot;Salmon River Scenic Byway&quot; as it heads toward the town of Salmon. From there, the highway follows portions of the Lewis and Clark Trail and passes through the Salmon-Challis National Forest before entering Montana.

===Montana===

US 93 enters Montana from Idaho at Lost Trail Pass and travels north descending through the Bitterroot National Forest. The highway continues along the Lewis and Clark Trail into the Bitterroot Valley towards Missoula, passing through Darby and Hamilton. At Lolo, U.S. Route 12 (US 12) joins from the west and they run concurrently northeast for , where US 93 heads due north on Reserve Street in Missoula. US 93 then joins Interstate 90 (I-90) and runs concurrently westward for to Wye, where it heads north.

From Wye, US 93 continues north through the Flathead Indian Reservation, where its signage includes the historic Salish and Kutenai names for towns, rivers, and streams. Portions of this section run along the CSKT Bison Range. North of the reservation, US 93 traverses the western shore of Flathead Lake, the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River. North of the lake the highway runs through the cities of Kalispell and Whitefish, traveling through the Flathead National Forest and the Stillwater State Forest before reaching its terminus at the Canada–US border near Eureka. On entering Canada, the roadway becomes British Columbia Highway 93. 

The portion north of Hamilton travels through one of the most densely populated areas in Montana. This section also serves as a popular north–south connection between Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park. As a result, the road tends to become more congested between Hamilton and Whitefish. A popular bumper sticker in Montana reads, &quot;Pray for me, I drive Hwy 93!&quot;
Total US 93 mileage in Montana as of 2013 is : from the Idaho line to Reserve Street in Missoula via corridor N-7 (C000007) (includes concurrency with US 12), via corridor N-92 (C000092) (Reserve Street), concurrent with I-90 and MT 200 (C000090) and from Wye to the Canadian border via corridor N-5 (C000005) (includes concurrency with Montana Highway 200).

==History==
US 93 was not one of the original U.S. highways proposed in the 1925 Bureau of Public Roads plan. However, the revised numbering plan approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) on November 11, 1926, established US 93 from the Canada–US border north of Eureka, Montana, south through Montana and Idaho to a southern terminus at Wells, Nevada.

US 93&#x27;s original northern terminus was a few miles west of its current terminus, along the Kootenai River at the Gateway Port of entry. This was the case until around 1934, when US 93 was routed along its current route.

AASHO, at its June 8, 1931, meeting, approved a southerly extension of US 93 south to Glendale, Nevada. By 1932, the Nevada Department of Highways had marked the continuation of the highway using the routing of several preexisting state highways.

At the request of the Arizona State Highway Department, the AASHO route numbering committee approved another extension of US 93 in 1935. This shifted the southern terminus south to Kingman, Arizona, by way of Las Vegas. Nevada officials again extended the route along preexisting highways; however, they may not have signed the extension right away as it was not shown on Nevada&#x27;s state-published maps until 1939.

Until 1993, US 93 ended a short distance north of Wickenburg, Arizona, at a junction with U.S. Route 89. When US 89 was decommissioned in the area, the US 93 designation was carried on into Wickenburg.

A highway segment opened on October 19, 2010, in the area of Hoover Dam; the Hoover Dam Bypass replaces a segment of US 93 over the dam that had been closed to truck traffic due to security concerns since the September 11 attacks in 2001. The bypass crosses the Colorado River on a bridge downstream of the dam. The bypass eliminated the permanent truck detour through either Laughlin, Nevada, or Needles, California, that had been in place since 2001.

==Future==
US 93 (with US 60 to the southeast of Wickenburg) is currently the shortest and most direct route between Las Vegas and Phoenix, two of the fastest-growing cities in the United States. Upgrades of US 60 and US 93 to expressway status are scheduled between Las Vegas and Phoenix. Most recently, in the 2012 Fixing America&#x27;s Surface Transportation Act, the United States Congress officially designated a new Interstate freeway corridor between the two cities as Interstate 11, which would mostly or completely replace US 93 in Arizona.

A new U.S. Route 93 Alternate was built to bypass through traffic around downtown Kalispell, Montana, from 2010 to 2016.

<doc id="290633" wikidata="Q1545178" url="?curid=290633" title="The Object of My Affection">
<text>The Object of My Affection is a 1998 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Nicholas Hytner, and starring Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd alongside Alan Alda, Nigel Hawthorne, John Pankow, and Tim Daly. The film was adapted from novel of the same name by Stephen McCauley and the screenplay was written by Wendy Wasserstein. The story focuses on a pregnant New York social worker who develops romantic feelings for her gay new friend and decides to raise her child with him, and the complications that ensue.

It was filmed in 1997 in various locations around New York City, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The film received mixed reviews and was a moderate box office success grossing $46.9 million against a production budget of $15 million.

==Plot==
Social worker Nina Borowski is a bright young woman living in a cozy Brooklyn apartment. Nina attends a party given by her stepsister Constance and her husband, Sidney. There Nina meets George Hanson, a young, handsome first-grade teacher who is gay. Nina tells George that her stepsister is constantly trying to fix her up with somebody from higher society, completely ignoring the fact that Nina has a boyfriend, Vince. During the conversation, Nina offers George a room in her apartment as she has just heard from his boyfriend, Dr. Robert Joley, that George is looking for somewhere to live. George, not knowing Robert&#x27;s plans, is taken aback and heartbroken, and after the party, the two split up. George accepts Nina&#x27;s offer and moves into her apartment.

The two soon become best friends; watching films together and going ballroom dancing. Everything is great until Nina announces that she is pregnant. Vince, the baby&#x27;s father, wants to marry her, but his constant control drives Nina crazy; she leaves him and George offers to help raise the child. For some time, they live together in her apartment in Brooklyn. Everything is perfect again until Nina finds that her love for George is growing every day, especially after he tells her he had a girlfriend in high school, leading her to believe they might develop a romantic relationship.

One afternoon, George and Nina are about to have sex when George gets a phone call from Robert, telling George he has missed him and invites him away for the weekend. George is confused but agrees to go. Nina feels threatened and jealous. George and Robert do not re-establish their relationship, but George meets Paul James, a young actor, and the two are attracted to each other. Meanwhile, Nina stays with Constance at a vacation mansion and is extremely moody. She has a horrible time, decides to head back home, and asks George to return as well. Her purse is snatched on the way and a friendly police officer, Louis, gives her a ride home.

Nina invites Paul and his older acting mentor with whom he lives, Rodney, for Thanksgiving after a rather prickly brunch with a late arriving George, his brother Frank, and his brother&#x27;s latest fiancée. After the evening winds down, Paul stays the night with George, resulting in a heated argument between George and Nina, and heartache for Rodney.

At Frank&#x27;s wedding, they continue their discussion as Nina begins to realize the reality of the situation. Nina fully explains to George her feelings for him. George, who loves Nina as his best friend, tells her that, ultimately, he wants to be with Paul. A few hours later, Nina gives birth to a baby girl she names Molly. Vince, ecstatic, visits her in the hospital, but when he leaves to complete paperwork, Nina and George remain alone with Molly. Nina asks George when he plans to move out to which he replies that he doesn&#x27;t know. She asks him to move out of her apartment before she gets home from the hospital, stating that it would hurt her too much to have him stay any longer knowing that he doesn&#x27;t love her the same way she does him.

Eight years later at George&#x27;s school, everyone goes to see Molly in a musical production that George has directed. George is now the principal of the school. Nina is now in a relationship with Louis, and George is still with Paul, both of them are now happy. Rodney is also there, still considered &#x27;one of the family&#x27; by Louis and Nina. Nina, George, and young Molly (who refers to George as her &quot;Uncle George&quot;) walk together, hand-in-hand, on their way to get coffee and talk.

==Cast==
==Production==
Paramount Pictures optioned McCauley&#x27;s book in the late 1980s. In 1993, Nicholas Hytner was brought in as director. Winona Ryder was offered the role of Nina, but turned it down so Uma Thurman was cast opposite Keanu Reeves. Paramount dropped the project in November 1996 and later Reeves and Thurman also dropped out. Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd were cast instead.

The shooting took place from June to July 1997, in New York.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;The Object of My Affection&quot; was released in US theaters on April 17, 1998, and took in $9,725,855 during its opening weekend, coming in at No. 2 at the box office in 1,890 theaters, averaging $5,146 per theater. The film went on to gross $29,187,243 in the United States alone, over a span of five weekends. The film continued to open in European countries throughout the fall and winter of 1998, and ultimately grossed $17,718,646 outside of the United States.

===Critical reception===
Critical reaction to the film was mixed. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars, saying: &quot;&quot;The Object of My Affection&quot; deals with some real issues and has scenes that work, but you can see the wheels of the plot turning so clearly that you doubt the characters have much freedom to act on their own.&quot;
Ruthe Stein of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said the film &quot;occasionally borders on being too clever. But that&#x27;s a small quibble about a movie that gets so much right.&quot;

The film holds a rating of 53% on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 59 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Despite heartfelt performances from Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd, &quot;The Object of My Affection&quot; suffers from too many plot contrivances and frequent turns into rom-com sappiness.&quot;
Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 51% based on 18 critics.

=== Accolades ===
In efforts of the film it received a GLAAD Media award nomination for Outstanding Film (Wide Release), and won the London Critics Circle Film award for British Supporting Actor of the Year awarded to actor Nigel Hawthorne.

<doc id="290634" wikidata="Q5093316" url="?curid=290634" title="Chess as mental training">
<text>There are efforts to use the game of chess as a tool to aid the intellectual development of young people. Chess is significant in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence (AI) studies, because it represents the domain in which expert performance has been most intensively studied and measured.

New York–based Chess-In-The-Schools, Inc. has been active in the public school system in the city since 1986. It currently reaches more than 30,000 students annually. America&#x27;s Foundation for Chess has initiated programs in partnership with local school districts in several U.S. cities, including Seattle, San Diego, Philadelphia, and Tampa. The Chess&#x27;n Math Association promotes chess at the scholastic level in Canada. Chess for Success is a program for at-risk schools in Oregon. Since 1991, the U.S. Chess Center in Washington, D.C. teaches chess to children, especially those in the inner city, &quot;as a means of improving their academic and social skills.&quot;

==Research==
Research has shown that chess can have a positive impact on meta-cognitive ability and mathematical problem-solving in children, which is why several local governments, schools, and student organizations all over the world are implementing chess programs.

There are a number of experiments that suggest that learning and playing chess aids the mind. The Grandmaster Eugene Torre Chess Institute in the Philippines, the United States Chess Federation&#x27;s chess research bibliography, and English educational consultant Tony Buzan&#x27;s Brain Foundation, among others, continuously collect such experimental results. The advent of chess software that automatically record and analyze the moves of each player in each game and can tirelessly play with human players of various levels, further helped in giving new directions to experimental designs on chess as mental training.

== History ==

As early as 1779 Benjamin Franklin, in his article &quot;The morals of chess&quot;, advocated such a view, saying:

Alfred Binet demonstrated in the late 19th century that good chess players have superior memory and imagination. Adriaan de Groot concurred with Alfred Binet that visual memory and visual perception are important attributors and that problem-solving ability is of paramount importance. Thus, since 1972, at the collegiate level, the University of Texas at Dallas and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County both recruit chessplayer-scholars and run scholastic outreach programs in their respective communities.

Broadcasters from thirty-seven countries have taken part since the first contest in .

Performers between the ages of 16 and 21 appointed by the participating broadcasters, compete as solo of couples to dance routines of their choice. Professional jury members each representing the elements of ballet, contemporary, and modern dancing, score each of the performances. The two participants which receive the most overall points advance to a televised &#x27;dance-off&#x27; final, where the winner is decided by the jury.

On 16 December 2017, the fifteenth and most recent edition took place in Prague, Czech Republic, and was won by Paulina Bidzińska repsesenting , with Patricija Crnkovič repsesenting placing second (runner-up).

==History==

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) holds two biennial youth competitions in alternate years, with Eurovision Young Dancers taking place in odd-numbered years and Eurovision Young Musicians in even-numbered years. The inaugural Eurovision Young Dancers contest –then known as Eurovision Competition for Young Dancers–, took place in Reggio Emilia, Italy, on 16 June 1985. EBU member broadcasters from twelve countries competed in the first contest. won that first edition, with Arantxa Argüelles. with by Arne Fagerholt, and with Mia Stagh and Göran Svalberg, came second and third respectively.

Broadcasters from a total of thirty-seven countries have competed at least once since 1985. is the only non-European country that has been represented in the contest (as well as the only country in the Americas to have ever participated in a Eurovision event), however their broadcaster, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), is an associate member of the EBU. Eurovision Young Dancers is also the only Eurovision event to feature a country whose broadcaster is neither a full nor associate member of the EBU, as Radio Television of Kosovo (RTK) made their sole appearance in 2011 representing (although it has broadcast other Eurovision events for many years). &#x27;s debut and only appearance in 1991 also marked the first participation of a former Warsaw Pact country in a Eurovision event, as well as the longest gap between a country&#x27;s debut at another Eurovision event prior to appearing at the Eurovision Song Contest (with fourteen years separating their Young Dancers debut and their Song Contest debut).

In the entire history of the event, only three contests (2007, 2009 and 2019) have never occurred. Eurovision Young Dancers 2007 was cancelled to allow the Prix de Lausanne, a similar event organised by Swiss broadcaster SRG SSR idée suisse to take place at the same venue. The decision to cancel the contest was mutually agreed between the host broadcaster and the EBU. The following contest was due to be held on 19 June 2009 at the Dance House in Oslo, however was eventually cancelled due to a lack of interest from broadcasters. The contest would eventually be held again in 2011 when the format was revived as a prime time show.

On 23 January 2017, the EBU announced that Maltese broadcaster Public Broadcasting Services (PBS), who agreed to host the event in July 2015, had been forced to cancel their staging of the competition. The EBU also stated it was looking for another host broadcaster but should one not be found in time the competition would not take place this year and is expected to return in 2019. On 18 May 2017, Czech broadcaster Česká televize (ČT) confirmed that they would host the contest for a second time.

On 20 December 2018, the contest was cancelled due to the absence of a broadcaster willing to host the competition. As of that time, and were the only eligible countries to have confirmed their intention to participate in the contest. In October 2020, the EBU ruled out bringing the contest back until further notice.

==Format==

The format has been roughly the same since the 1985 inauguration of the competition. All competing dancers are to be non-professional and between the ages of 16–21. Participants may consist of solo or couples, with each performing a dance routine of their choice, which they have prepared in advance of the competition. All of the acts then take part in a choreographed group dance during &#x27;Young Dancers Week&#x27;.

From 1989 to 2003, a semi-final round took place a few days before the contest, and the jury decided as well which countries qualified for the televised final. In the 2003 contest, the professional jury voted electronically, immediately following each act, awarding points for technique and artistry. For the 2005 contest, the traditional format was changed. A week of dance master classes replaced the semi-final round. Florence Clerc, Irek Mukhamedow, Christopher Bruce and Piotr Nardelli were the dance teachers selected to work with the participants and tasked to select the ten finalists out of the 13 participating countries.

In 1989 and 2003, the contest awarded two sets of first prize, one for classical and one for contemporary dance. Two jury&#x27;s special prizes were also handed out in 1989 and an additional &quot;Youth Jury&quot; prize was awarded in 2003, chosen by a panel of dance enthusiasts in the audience.

The format was revamped in 2011 to include a &#x27;final duel&#x27; round and the semi-finals are removed due to the low number of participating countries. Jury members of a professional aspect and representing the elements of ballet, contemporary, and modern dancing styles, score each of the competing individual and group dance routines. Once all the jury votes have been counted, the two participants which received the highest total of points progress to a final round. The final round consists of a 90-second &#x27;dual&#x27;, were each of the finalists perform a 45-second random dance-off routine. The overall winner upon completion of the final dances is chosen by the professional jury members.

==Participation==

Eligible participants include primarily active member broadcasters (as opposed to associate members) of the EBU. Active members are located in countries that fall within the European Broadcasting Area, or are member states of the Council of Europe.

The European Broadcasting Area is defined by the International Telecommunication Union:

:&quot;The &quot;European Broadcasting Area&quot; is bounded on the west by the western boundary of Region 1, on the east by the meridian 40° East of Greenwich and on the south by the parallel 30° North so as to include the northern part of Saudi Arabia and that part of those countries bordering the Mediterranean within these limits. In addition, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and those parts of the territories of Iraq, Jordan, Syrian Arab Republic, Turkey and Ukraine lying outside the above limits are included in the European Broadcasting Area.&quot;

The western boundary of Region 1 is defined by a line running from the North Pole along meridian 10° West of Greenwich to its intersection with parallel 72° North; thence by great circle arc to the intersection of meridian 50° West and parallel 40° North; thence by great circle arc to the intersection of meridian 20° West and parallel 10° South; thence along meridian 20° West to the South Pole.

Active members are broadcasting organisations whose transmissions are made available to at least 98% of households in their own country which are equipped to receive such transmissions. If an EBU active member broadcaster wishes to participate, it must fulfil conditions as laid down by the rules of the contest (of which a separate copy is drafted annually).

Eligibility to participate is not determined by geographic inclusion within the continent of Europe, despite the &quot;Euro&quot; in &quot;Eurovision&quot; – nor does it have any relation to the European Union. , a partially recognised state in Southeastern Europe, is the only country in Europe who does not yet have EBU members, but has participated once in .

<text>Meritt Records was an American jazz and blues record company and label that existed from 1925 to 1929. It was founded in Kansas City by Winston Holmes, the owner of a music store. Records were made in his studio and sold only in his store.

Holmes produced about 20 double-sided acoustically recorded phonograph records in the mid and late 1920s. Most of the sides are of locally based jazz and blues performers, plus some gospel music and sermons.

<doc id="290669" wikidata="Q1092408" url="?curid=290669" title="Cinelerra">
<text>Cinelerra is a video editing and track-based digital compositing program (an NLE, Non-Linear Editor) designed for Linux. It is free software distributed under the open source GNU General Public License. In addition to editing, it supports advanced composition operations such as keying and mattes, including a title generator, many effects to edit video and audio, keyframe automation, and many other professional functions depending on the variant. It processes audio in 64 floating-point form. Video is processed in RGBA or YUVA color spaces, in 16-bit integer or floating-point form. It is resolution and image refresh rate independent. The HV &amp; GG variants support up to 8K video. The GG variant can also create DVDs and Blu-rays. 

==History==
In 1996 Adam Williams of Heroine Virtual, lead developer of Cinelerra, released a Unix audio editor called Broadcast 1.0 which could handle 2G audio files. In 1997 Broadcast 2.0 was released, still audio only but unlimited tracks. 1999 saw Broadcast2000, which included video. See the History of Cinelerra versions section for more detail.

Because of UI limitations, Williams rewrote significant parts and released that as Cinelerra on August 12, 2002, while Broadcast2000 was withdrawn by Heroine Virtual in September 2001. Cinelerra became the first 64-bit media production application when it was rewritten to work with the AMD Opteron processor in June 2003 and was presented at SIGGRAPH 2004 in San Diego. Since then, many versions have been released.

The original version is still being produced by Adam Williams. There have been several spin-offs made by the open source community, Cinelerra-GG and Cinelerra-CVE (a fork of Cinelerra-CV) are presently under active development. For a complete overview of versions, see the Variants section below. Even though the different variants look the same, there are considerable functional differences between them. 

An overview of the different variants that released more than one version:
==Interface==
Cinelerra&#x27;s interface is similar to that of other Non-linear editing systems, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, and Avid Media Composer. However, because it includes a compositing engine, it may also be likened to compositing software such as Adobe After Effects, Smoke on Linux or Shake. The user is by default presented with four windows (clockwise from lower left in picture at top right):
# The &quot;timeline&quot;, which gives the user a time-based view of all video and audio tracks in the project, as well as keyframe data for e.g. camera movement, effects, or opacity.
# The &quot;viewer&quot;, which gives the user a method of &quot;scrubbing&quot; (manually moving the playhead forwards or backwards to locate a specific cue or word) through footage.
# The &quot;compositor&quot;, which presents the user with a view of the final project as it would look when rendered. The compositor is interactive in that it allows the user to adjust the positions of video objects; it also updates in response to user input.
# The &quot;resource window&quot;, which presents the user with a view of all audio and video resources in the project, as well as available audio and video effects and transitions.

Cinelerra uses its own widget toolkit Guicast (the Cinelerra GUI library), not conforming to the human interface guidelines of major Linux desktops such as GNOME and KDE. This has the advantage that it looks and works the same no matter which distribution or desktop is used, and removes being dependent on a changing version of the desktop (for instance GNOME 2 / GNOME 3). Guicast was written by Adam Williams. The repository of Guicast is available on GitHub 

==Usage and awards==
Cinelerra has gained ground among some Linux enthusiasts looking for a native video editing system. Professional use was mostly promoted by Linux Media Arts, which sold an integrated hardware and software package for video production that includes Cinelerra. However, the company does not seem to be active in the Cinelerra field anymore.

At the National Association of Broadcasters&#x27; 2004 Electronic Media Show, Cinelerra received Bob Turner&#x27;s &quot;Making the Cut&quot; award, given to &quot;the best and most exciting post-production products seen at the convention&quot;.

In December 2018 Libre Graphics World included Cinelerra in its comparison of the sustainability of video editors for Linux.

==Cinelerra.org==
The cinelerra.org website was originally registered by a member of Cinelerra-CV Community Richard Baverstock on Jan 10 2004. Around January 2014 the Cinelerra-CV Community overlooked the renewal of cinelerra.org. The domain was then taken over by a different project managed by Michael Collins, one of the founders of Cinelerra. The project was following commercial interests, aiming at offering professional support to its users. It was organized to merge all existing Cinelerra projects while also providing additional fixes and enhancements.

Since early 2015, Cinelerra.org has an open Git repository on Google Code for analysis and for input; however, that platform is read-only since 2015-08-24. At the present time, this repository does not contain source code. The project released a studio centric version 5.0 of Cinelerra. The goal of Cinelerra.org was to develop a more professional value to the product as of 2016.

In January 2016, the main developer of the project William Morrow working behind cinelerra.org (&quot;Good Guy&quot;) left cinelerra.org, continuing to work on Cinelerra 5.0, then on Cinelerra-GG 5.1 with help from the Cinelerra-CV Community.

At the present time, Cinelerra.org supports Cinelerra-HV work. Its website links in the download section to both the HV and GG versions.

==Variants==
===Cinelerra-HV===
Heroine Virtual (HV), the producer of the original Cinelerra, generates a new release of Cinelerra annually, available as source code and a binary for Ubuntu in the HV-repo on SourceForge and as source code in the HV-repo on GitHub. A new rolling repository for Cinelerra-HV was published on Feb. 2024 in the HV-repo on GitHub. This repo contains the binaries (continuous builds) for Ubuntu. These continuous builds contain the latest features and bug fixes for testing purposes. After each update to the source code repository on GH, Adam Wiiliams builds/provides a binary file for testing (in the binary repo on GH).

HV has used SourceForge since the beginning (first source 2001-09-09), but does not react to bugs, patches and feature requests on that platform. The source on SourceForge is only made available as complete download for each release. Intermediate access to source files on SF is not possible. Any bugs and usability issues found and resolved by the community that are submitted to Heroine Virtual often result in no immediate response, and it is not until a new release that there is any indication that Heroine Virtual has incorporated these changes.

Intermediate access to source files as well as an immediate response is possible in the HV-repo on GitHub. The developer responds to bug reports, requests for fixes or additional features through this platform. Use GitHub Issues to track ideas, feedback, bugs, or usability issues.

To distinguish between the different variants of the software, the releases made by Heroine Virtual are also called Cinelerra-HV.

===Cinelerra-CV / Cinelerra-CVE===

Because of both the latency in development and the distribution-specific nature of the original Cinelerra from Heroine Virtual, a group of software developers created their own version of Cinelerra referred to as Cinelerra-CV (where CV stands for &quot;community version&quot;).

Cinelerra-CV allows the community to contribute to an open repository where changes to the code are accessible to everyone. Mailing list exist where more experienced users and developers can provide support to less experienced users, and developers can hold technical discussions. Cinelerra-CV is also packaged for a wider range of distributions. It also has a different compilation system: system libraries are used extensively, and the autoconf/automake tools are used to configure the compilation system.

Although Cinelerra-CV may technically be called a fork, the relationship between Heroine Virtual and Cinelerra-CV is rather friendly. Heroine Virtual at times contributes to discussions on the mailing lists, and incorporates many of the changes made in the repository.

Heroine Virtual posted the following message on their website describing the relationship:
Up until Cinelerra 2.1 the versioning of Cinelerra-CV followed that of Heroine Virtual. After Heroine Virtual released a new version, Cinelerra-CV merged relevant code from the new HV variant and into their variant. &quot;CV&quot; was appended to the end of the version number to indicate the community version (For example, after the 2.1 merger the CV version was labeled &quot;2.1CV&quot;).

Starting with release 2.2, Cinelerra-CV uses its own versioning scheme, but still merges code from Cinelerra-HV. Following the 26th June 2019, the official web pages were taken offline and the URL redirects to the website for Cinelerra-GG.

The new official site of Cinelerra-CV was published on July 1 2020. The source code of Cinelerra-CV is available from the new official repo on GitHub . The new official Cinelerra-CV Mailing List is available here. The Cinelerra-CV Mailing list from 2001 is archived. The complete collection of old (previous) Cinelerra-CV Mailing List archives is referenced/linked from this page of the new official Cinelerra-CV site.

Cinelerra-CVE is a Cinelerra-CV fork created for experimenting with Cinelerra&#x27;s code. The fork was created by the main Cinelerra-CV developer (2012-2018) Einar Rünkaru in June 2008 and published in the middle of March 2010.

The repository of Cinelerra-CVE is available on GitHub and shows frequent updates. To know more about Cinelerra-CVE, visit this page on the new official
Cinelerra-CV site.

===Lumiera===

In April 2008, the Cinelerra community engaged into a rework and rewrite of the Community Version.
Initially called Cinelerra3, it was soon separated into an independent project. The name Lumiera was chosen by the community through a collaborative selection
and vote.

The project maintained active development ever since, yet there is no usable application as of October 2023, since the core team decided to build the engine and infrastructure bottom-up, while the UI is developed to match the capabilities of the core.

Lumiera is not a fork of Cinelerra. Not a single line of Cinelerra code is now used in Lumiera. Lumiera is built from scratch, starting with the engine core, yet pursuing a similar vision and expanding on some of the ideas and approaches found in Cinelerra. The project grew out of an effort to amend long standing problems present in the Cinelerra-CV code base at that time. The actual technology however is built ground-up, using contemporary methods.

The project remains in a pre-alpha status of development with a yearly development news update Lumiera news.

Lumiera&#x27;s native interface will be written in GTK+, although other interfaces will be possible, since the user interface is loaded as a plug-in.

The goal of the Lumiera project is to build a free open-source nonlinear video editing and compositing application (NLE).

===Cinelerra-GG Infinity===
Cinelerra-GG, a separate variant of Cinelerra by William Morrow and Phyllis Smith, started with merged code from Cinelerra-HV and Cinelerra-CV but quickly grew. It was first developed within Cinelerra.org (Cinelerra 4.6-mod, Cinelerra 5.0), then within the site of Cinelerra-cv.org (Cinelerra 5.0, Cinelerra 5.1, Cinelerra GG 5.1), and since December 2018 with its own website cinelerra-gg.org as Cinelerra-GG Infinity. William died on 11/2020 during a bicycle ride, but Phyllis continues to work on Cinelerra-GG. A new developer is now making frequent updates.

An important issue is that Cinelerra-GG reduces reliance on system libraries by including them where practical, like ffmpeg and OpenEXR. This makes it more predictable on different platforms, and also allows it to pick up new versions before the platform does.

Cinelerra-GG is determined to get as close as possible to what can be expected from professional level video editing software (NLE) for the Linux platform.

Its software features include support for recent versions of ffmpeg, extensive color correction tools, Ultra HD up to 8K, more than 400 video- and audio effects, two interfaces for audio plug-ins (LADSPA, and LV2 such as Calf Studio Gear), multiple denoisers and motion stabilizers, multi-camera editing, proxies, smart folders media filtering, 8, 10 and 12 bit color spaces, advanced trim, live preview of resources, shared tracks, group edits, horizontal and/or vertical timeline split, rendering pre-configuration options, and the ability to save workspace layouts. It supports over 400 video/picture formats for decoding, and over 140 for encoding, including Apple ProRes, AV1, and WEBP. It has a ¨Sketcher&quot; plug-in for free-hand drawing, supports creating HD Blu-ray, and DVDs, and some OpenCV plugins like FindObj. It allows nested clips, and clip sharing between projects (&quot;file-by-reference&quot;).

Its hardware support is for jog-wheels ShuttlePRO V.2 and ShuttleXpress from Contour Design, multiple monitors, HiDPI, and hardware-supported decoding/encoding via VAAPI/VDPAU/CUDA.

Like the other Cinelerra variants Cinelerra-GG uses its own GUI. It has eleven GUI themes to cater to user preferences.

The GG variant is under active development, with regular stable releases. It is supplied as a 64 or 32 bit AppImage for Linux. The source code is available as (manual) monthly download or from its git.

Before 2021, it was supplied as a multi user program pre-packaged for eight different Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, OpenSuse, Slackware, Fedora, Centos, Mint), and FreeBSD. When the applicable repository was added to a distribution&#x27;s update manager, the monthly updates would appear automatically. In addition, there were single-user builds for the eight Linux distributions plus Gentoo, as tar files. All those builds are available in 64-bit, for Debian 9, Slackware and Ubuntu 14 there are also 32-bit single user builds. As a proof-of-concept, with the 2020-01 release was a Windows version with limited functionality; for details see the manual&#x27;s chapter 1.

In addition to the GG variant&#x27;s monthly releases, it is also available in two Linux variants dedicated to multimedia: AVLinux, and Bodhi Linux Media. It is also included in DeLinuxCo, and in lightweight Elive, of which the 32 bit version is usable on older computers.

Cinelerra-GG communicates with it users and developers through three platforms: its forum (user oriented), a bug tracker (feature requests, bugs, roadmap), and a mailing list (developers discussions). Each monthly release has a significant number of changes resulting from discussions and exchanges of information on these platforms.

Cinelerra-GG has an extensive, actively maintained manual in both PDF and HTML form, which is also accessible from within the Cinelerra-GG program. The manual is helpful for both beginners (e.g. Quickstart section) and professionals. There is also a YouTube channel with tutorials.

The differences between the GG and other Cinelerra variants can be found in .

<doc id="290679" wikidata="Q33637" url="?curid=290679" title="Marcel Reich-Ranicki">
<text>Marcel Reich-Ranicki (; 2 June 1920 – 18 September 2013) was a Polish-born German literary critic and member of the informal literary association Gruppe 47. He was regarded as one of the most influential contemporary literary critics in the field of German literature and has often been called &quot;Literaturpapst&quot; (&quot;Pope of Literature&quot;) in Germany.

==Life==

===Early life===
Marcel Reich was born on 2 June 1920 in Włocławek, Poland, to David Reich, a Polish Jewish merchant, and his wife, Helene (née Auerbach) Reich, who came from a German Jewish family (his cousin is the painter Frank Auerbach). Reich and his family moved to Berlin in 1929. He attended a German school there, but was later sent to Berlin to study.

Reich dedicated himself to the reading of German classics and practicing the theatre. The literary critic Volker Weidermann wrote that &quot;he found his salvation in literature&quot;. As a Jew he was unable to enroll at university and was then expelled back to Poland in 1938. After being denied at the University of Berlin, he was arrested and deported to Poland. In his 1999 autobiography, &quot;The Author of Himself&quot;, Ranicki affirmed, &quot;I had a ticket for [a] première that evening – I wouldn&#x27;t be needing it.&quot;

In November 1940, Reich and his parents found themselves in the Warsaw Ghetto, during which time he worked for the Judenrat as a chief translator, and contributed to the collaborative newspaper &quot;Gazeta Żydowska&quot; (&quot;The Jewish Newspaper&quot;) as a music critic. Reich&#x27;s translation work made him an eyewitness to meetings between the Jewish and Nazi authorities.

Ranicki survived the Jewish deportation in the Warsaw Ghetto, where he married his wife Teofila, whereas his parents were murdered in the Treblinka extermination camp. In 1943, Reich and his wife escaped the Ghetto. His parents and brother were murdered in the Holocaust. His sister survived, having escaped to England shortly before the war.

In 1944, he joined the Polish People&#x27;s Army, and became an officer in Urząd Bezpieczeństwa, the Soviet-controlled Polish secret police, known for using torture and human rights violations, where he worked in the censorship department. He joined the communist Polish Workers&#x27; Party after the war.

From 1948 to 1949, he was a Polish diplomat and intelligence worker (operating under the pseudonym &quot;Ranicki&quot;) in London. The couple&#x27;s only child, Andrew Ranicki, a topologist and mathematics professor, was born in London in 1948. Reich was recalled from London in 1949, sacked from the intelligence service, and expelled from the Party on charges of &quot;ideological estrangement&quot;, for which he was also jailed for a short time.
Subsequently, he developed a career as an editor, publisher of East German authors, and freelance writer for newspapers and radio with a focus on German literature.

===Life in Germany===

Frustrated by the curtailment of his liberty in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland he emigrated in 1958 with his wife and son to the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), living in the city of Hamburg. Here he began writing for leading West German periodicals, including &quot;Die Welt&quot; and the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;. In Poland, he had published under the pseudonym &quot;Ranicki&quot; (his intelligence codename). On the advice of the arts editor of the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine&quot;, he adopted the name Marcel Reich-Ranicki professionally. From 1963 to 1973, he was literary critic for the West German weekly &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, published in Hamburg.

In 1973, he moved to Frankfurt, where, from 1973 to 1988, he was head of the literature staff at the daily &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;. Reich-Ranicki would go on to write and edit for the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; for the rest of his life. In 1969 he taught at Vermont. From 1971 to 1975, he held visiting professorships at Stockholm and Uppsala.

In 1974, he was awarded an honorary professorship at the University of Tübingen, West Germany. In 1990 and 1991, he received the Heinrich-Hertz visiting professorship of the University of Karlsruhe, and in 1991 and 1992, he received the Heinrich-Heine visiting professorship at the University of Düsseldorf.

From 1988 to 2001, Reich-Ranicki hosted the literary talk show &quot;Literarisches Quartett&quot; on German public television. He became a household name in Germany; according to a survey, 98% of Germans knew his name. In Summer 2000, fellow panelist Sigrid Löffler left the panel, complaining that Reich-Ranicki had put forward Haruki Murakami&#x27;s erotic novel &quot;South of the Border, West of the Sun&quot; for discussion, which Löffler disliked. Reich-Ranicki answered that she had a problem with erotic literature in general. Although differences over Murakami provided a catalyst for Löffler&#x27;s widely publicised departure from the programme, it does appear that tensions between Löffler and Reich-Ranicki were more broadly based and longstanding, having indeed nourished the programme&#x27;s dynamic over the years. In 2002, the show was followed by a similar but short-lived programme, &quot;Reich-Ranicki Solo&quot;, which consisted of him talking about old and new books in front of a studio audience. Jack Zipes wrote: &quot;On his television show, Reich-Ranicki often played the clown, a mixture of Milton Berle and Jack Benny, but you always had to take him seriously because his knowledge of German culture was so comprehensive.&quot;

In 1993, the weekly &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; gave him a dossier of about fifteen pages, under the title &quot;The Lord of Books&quot;, tracing his career, first to &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, then to the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;. Many writers, and readers too, disagreed with some traits of his complex personality, while universally recognizing his culture and passion for German literature.

Having written about German literature for most of his life, he also published books on American and Polish literature. After cutting down on his television appearances. Reich-Ranicki&#x27;s wife and son encouraged him to write an autobiography &quot;before it was too late&quot;. Published in 1999, &quot;The Author of Himself: The Life of Marcel Reich-Ranicki&quot; was a bestseller in Germany, cementing his status. Mainly dealing with life and survival during the war, the book was adapted for television and broadcast starring Matthias Schweighöfer as Reich-Ranicki in April 2009.

In February 2006, he received an honorary doctorate from Tel Aviv University, which later that year established an endowed chair for German literature named after him. In February 2007, the Humboldt University in Berlin awarded him an honorary degree. This is the same university that Reich-Ranicki applied to in 1938, when his application was turned down because of his Jewish ancestry.

In October 2008, he was awarded a lifetime achievement award at the German Television Awards telecast for &quot;Literarisches Quartett&quot;. He made headlines with his acceptance speech, in which he spurned the prize and criticized the state of German television. He also declared he would have paid any monetary award back, had the prize been associated with a monetary reward.

In 2012, Reich-Ranicki made a speech at the Bundestag on International Holocaust Remembrance Day. He continued to write a weekly column in the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; until shortly before his death.

The autobiography &quot;The Author of Himself&quot;, published in 1999, begins with Reich-Ranicki reporting a conversation in 1958 with Günter Grass asking him: &quot;Are you German, or Polish, or what?&quot;. The answer was: &quot;Half German...&quot;.

===Death ===
Reich-Ranicki died on 18 September 2013 in Frankfurt, having previously been diagnosed with prostate cancer. German Chancellor Angela Merkel paid tribute: &quot;We lose in him a peerless friend of literature, but also of freedom and democracy. I will miss this passionate and brilliant man.&quot; The &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; described Reich-Ranicki as &quot;the man who taught us how to read.&quot;

Marcel&#x27;s son, Andrew Ranicki (1948–2018), was a professor of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. Marcel&#x27;s wife, Teofila Reich-Ranicki, predeceased her husband by two years, dying in 2011. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;He appreciated Jewish culture, especially its way with words, but found religion pointless and, after Warsaw, God inconceivable.&quot;

==Relationships with authors==
As a tough critic, Reich-Ranicki had a difficult relationship with other authors. Following the publication of &quot;Too Far Afield&quot; by his fellow Gruppe 47 member Günter Grass, Reich-Ranicki appeared on the cover of the magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, tearing the novel apart. The magazine included his unfavorable review of the book. Reich-Ranicki praised Grass&#x27; next book, &quot;Crabwalk&quot;. Another frequent target of Reich-Ranicki was writer Martin Walser. In 2002, Walser published the crime novel &quot;Death of a Critic&quot; (Tod eines Kritikers) as a revenge against Reich-Ranicki. In the book, a prominent, bigoted critic named &quot;André Ehrl-König&quot; – who shares many similarities with Reich-Ranicki – is murdered. The novel became a hot topic of debate in Germany.

Australian writer Clive James stated: &quot;Every living German writer wants his praise, but it has always been hard to get: the reason, of course, why they would like to have it.&quot;

<doc id="290681" wikidata="Q981847" url="?curid=290681" title="Richard Bruton">
<text>Richard Bruton (born 15 March 1953) is an Irish former Fine Gael politician who served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for Dublin Bay North from 2016 to 2024, and previously from 1982 to 2016 for the Dublin North-Central constituency. He was the Chair of the Fine Gael parliamentary party from July 2020 to September 2023. He previously served as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment from 2018 to 2020, Minister for Education and Skills from 2016 to 2018, Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation from 2011 to 2016, Deputy leader of Fine Gael from 2002 to 2010, Minister for Enterprise and Employment from 1994 to 1997 and Minister of State for Energy Affairs from 1986 to 1987. He was a Senator for the Agricultural Panel from 1981 to 1982.

==Early and private life==
Bruton was born in Dublin in 1953, but grew up in Dunboyne, County Meath. He is a son of Joseph and Doris Bruton. He was educated at Belvedere College, Clongowes Wood College, University College Dublin and Nuffield College, Oxford. At Oxford, he graduated with a MPhil in Economics, his thesis being on the subject of Irish public debt. He is a research economist by profession. After university he worked at the Economic and Social Research Institute. This was followed by two years in the tobacco company P. J. Carroll, before moving on to his final private sector job at CRH.

He is the younger brother of John Bruton, who was Taoiseach from 1994 to 1997.

Bruton is married to Susan Meehan; they have four children, two sons and two daughters.

==Early political career: 1979–1992==
Bruton was elected to Meath County Council in 1979 and was elected to Seanad Éireann in 1981, as a Senator for the Agricultural Panel. At the February 1982 general election, he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael TD for the Dublin North-Central constituency. After an initial period on the backbenches, Bruton was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Energy, following the dismissal of Edward Collins in September 1986. In opposition after 1987, Bruton served in a number of front bench positions including, Energy, Natural Resources, Health, Enterprise and Employment and Director of Policy. He was also the campaign manager for his brother John Bruton&#x27;s successful party leadership bid in 1990.

==Minister for Enterprise and Employment: 1994–1997==
Following the 1992 general election, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party formed a coalition government, which collapsed in 1994. Bruton then helped to negotiate the Rainbow Coalition between Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left. In that government, his brother John Bruton became Taoiseach. Bruton was appointed as Minister for Enterprise and Employment.

==Return to Opposition: 1997–2011==
A return to opposition in 1997 saw Bruton become opposition spokesperson on Education and Science, a position he held until he was appointed Director of Policy and Press Director in a reshuffle in 2000. After losing the 2002 party leadership election to Enda Kenny, Bruton was retained on the front bench and promoted to deputy leader as well as spokesperson on Finance. After an unsuccessful leadership challenge in 2010, he was demoted to spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.

===Dublin City Council: 1999–2003===
He was elected to Dublin City Council in 1999, representing the Artane local electoral area. He relinquished this seat when dual mandates were banned in 2003.

===Fine Gael leadership election: 2002===
Fine Gael had a disastrous election result at the 2002 general election; Bruton was one of the few frontbench Fine Gael TDs to retain his seat. The party lost 23 of its 54 TDs; party leader Michael Noonan soon resigned following the poll. Bruton stood as a candidate in the subsequent leadership election. He was defeated by Enda Kenny, but he was appointed deputy leader of Fine Gael and spokesperson for Finance, posts he maintained until 2010.

===Deputy leader and spokesperson on Finance: 2002–2010===
Bruton was appointed Finance spokesperson in 2002. In that role, he was a consistent critic of government economic policy. In particular, he warned about the government&#x27;s overreliance on the property sector and said that the government was ignoring the erosion of competitiveness and the loss of export market share as a growing construction sector temporarily insulated the economy from their effects.
In 2006, he told the Dáil that the government had &quot;doubled its dependence on the construction sector to support its revenue. A total of 25% of every tax euro spent by the government comes from the construction sector. We are not in a strong position; we are, in fact, in a vulnerable position&quot;.

Bruton raised concerns about the payment of benchmarking awards. In 2003, on behalf of Fine Gael, he proposed a motion that the payment of the remaining phases of benchmarking be suspended pending implementation of a serious reform package so that the €1.3 Billion cost of benchmarking would be matched by commensurate improvements in public services.

===Fine Gael leadership challenge: 2010===
On 14 June 2010, Bruton was sacked as deputy leader and spokesperson on Finance, by his leader Enda Kenny, after he informed his colleagues that he would be proposing a leadership challenge against Kenny. Kenny explained that he and Bruton had had a series of discussions in which Bruton said he had lost confidence in him. Kenny later told the media that &quot;Richard&#x27;s decision leaves me with no option but to relieve him of all his responsibilities&quot;. He also said that &quot;some unnamed people have done huge damage to Fine Gael through their anonymous comments to the media which has resulted in an opinion poll dominating the news agenda&quot;. He then assigned responsibility for the Finance portfolio to Deputy Kieran O&#x27;Donnell.

The first TD to come out in support of Bruton before his sacking was frontbencher Fergus O&#x27;Dowd from County Louth. Nine other members of the front bench publicly expressed no confidence in Kenny&#x27;s leadership. These included Leo Varadkar, Simon Coveney, Brian Hayes and Olivia Mitchell.

On 17 June 2010, a meeting of the parliamentary party was held and the 70 members cast their vote. The outcome was that the parliamentary party voted confidence in Enda Kenny as leader. Bruton then declined to comment as to whether he would serve in Kenny&#x27;s front bench, despite saying earlier that it would be hypocritical to do so. On 1 July 2010, he was appointed by Kenny as spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.

==Return to Government: 2011–2020==
===Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation: 2011–2016===
Bruton was appointed by the new Taoiseach Enda Kenny as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on 9 March 2011.

Bruton launched the first annual Action Plan for Jobs in 2012. The Plan&#x27;s high-level target was to create 100,000 net new jobs by 2016. Bruton announced in May 2015, that the target to create 100,000 additional new jobs had been hit almost two years early. The Action Plan is based on setting realistic targets and focusing on them until the measures required are in place. In &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in early 2014, Stephen Collins wrote approvingly that &quot;hundreds of commitments in the programme are steadily being delivered by Minister for Jobs Richard Bruton&quot; and a year later described the annual plan which is &quot;driven by Minister for Jobs Richard Bruton&quot; as being &quot;one of the outstanding success stories of the Coalition’s term&quot;. In an editorial the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; said that Bruton deserves credit for the manner in which the Action Plan for Jobs has been crafted and implemented across a range of government departments over the last three years. A review of the Action Plan for Jobs by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) concluded it had led to two significant developments in Irish public governance. One is a concerted whole of government policy implementation with political backing and oversight at the highest level. The other important development noted by the OECD is the rigorous quarterly monitoring and reporting system modelled on the Troika programme.

While campaigning for the government before the European Fiscal Compact referendum on 17 May 2012, Bruton admitted on live radio the possibility of there being a second referendum if the Irish people voted &quot;No&quot;.

===Minister for Education and Skills: 2016–2018===
Following the 2016 general election, there was a delay in government formation. On 9 May 2016, after talks had concluded on forming a new government, Enda Kenny appointed Bruton as Minister for Education and Skills. Bruton launched the first Action Plan for Education in September 2016. The Plan&#x27;s high-level ambition is to make Ireland&#x27;s education and training system the best in Europe by 2026. Following the election of Leo Varadkar as Taoiseach, Bruton was reappointed as Minister for Education and Skills on 14 June 2017.

===Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment: 2018–2020===
After Minister Denis Naughten&#x27;s resignation from government due to controversy surrounding the National Broadband Plan, Bruton became Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on 11 October 2018.

<doc id="290687" wikidata="Q191702" url="?curid=290687" title="Semyon Timoshenko">
<text>Semyon Konstantinovich Timoshenko (; ; – 31 March 1970) was a Soviet military commander, Marshal of the Soviet Union, and one of the most prominent Red Army commanders during the Second World War.

Born to a Ukrainian family in Bessarabia, Timoshenko was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army and saw action in the First World War as a cavalryman. On the outbreak of the Russian Revolution he joined the Red Army. He served with distinction during the Russian Civil War and the subsequent Polish–Soviet War, which brought him into Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s and Joseph Stalin&#x27;s favour. Rapidly rising through the ranks, Timoshenko held several regional commands throughout the 1930s and survived the Great Purge. He led the Ukrainian Front during the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. In early 1940, Timoshenko took over the command of the Winter War in Finland from Kliment Voroshilov and turned the tide for the Soviets. In May 1940, he was named a Marshal of the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Commissar for Defence. In the latter capacity, he took steps to modernise the Red Army and prepare for a likely war with Nazi Germany.

On the outbreak of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Timoshenko was named chairman of the Stavka. Replaced by Stalin himself a month later, he went on to hold a series of important commands in the following year. In late 1941, he organised a major counter-offensive in Rostov, which brought him international renown. His fortunes had faltered by mid-1942, in particular after the overwhelming Soviet defeat at the Second Battle of Kharkov, and he was relieved from the command of the newly formed Stalingrad Front. He was recalled later that year and appointed commander of the Northwestern Front, and as a Stavka representative he oversaw and coordinated the activities of several fronts in various times during the last phase of the war, including the Leningrad, Volkhov, and North Caucasus Fronts and the Black Sea Fleet, and the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian fronts.

After the war, Timoshenko held commands in several Soviet military districts until his effective retirement in 1960. He died in 1970 at the age of 75.

==Early life==
Born in Orman in the Akkerman uezd, Bessarabia Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Furmanivka, Odesa Oblast, Ukraine), to an ethnic Ukrainian family.

==Military career==

===First World War===
In 1914, he was drafted into the army of the Russian Empire and served as a cavalryman on Russia&#x27;s western front in the First World War. Upon the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in 1917, he sided with the Bolsheviks, joining the Red Army in 1918 and the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1919.

===Russian Civil War===
During the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923, Timoshenko served on various fronts. He fought against Polish forces in Kiev and then against Pyotr Wrangel&#x27;s White Army and Nestor Makhno&#x27;s Black Army. His most important encounter occurred at Tsaritsyn, where he commanded a cavalry regiment and met and befriended Joseph Stalin, who was responsible for the city&#x27;s defense. The personal connection would ensure his rapid advancement after Stalin gained control of the Communist Party by the end of the 1920s. In 1920–1921, Timoshenko served under Semyon Budyonny and Kliment Voroshilov in the 1st Cavalry Army; Budyonny and Voroshilov became the core of the &quot;Cavalry Army clique&quot; which, under Stalin&#x27;s patronage, would dominate the Red Army for many years. In April 1920, he was given command of the Sixth Division of the Red Cavalry, which was the first to attack the Polish army during the &#x27;May offensive&#x27; launched by the Red Army during the Polish-Soviet War. On 29 May, the Sixth Division charged Polish trenches, taking heavy casualties for no gain, which convinced the Soviet commanders that charging trenches was pointless.

===The 1930s===

By the end of the civil and Polish–Soviet wars, Timoshenko had become the commander of the Red Army cavalry forces. Thereafter, under Stalin, he became Red Army commander in Byelorussia (1933); in Kiev (1935); in the northern Caucasus and then Kharkov (1937); and Kiev again (1938). In 1939, he was given command of the entire western border region and led the Ukrainian Front during the Soviet invasion of eastern Poland. He also became a member of the Communist Party&#x27;s Central Committee. Due to being a loyal friend of Lenin and Stalin, Timoshenko survived the Great Purge to become the Red Army&#x27;s senior professional soldier.

===World War II: The Winter War===
In January 1940, Timoshenko took charge of the Soviet armies fighting Finland in the Soviet-Finnish War. This began the previous November, under the disastrous command of Kliment Voroshilov. Under Timoshenko&#x27;s leadership, the Soviets succeeded in breaking through the Finnish Mannerheim Line on the Karelian Isthmus. His reputation increased, Timoshenko was made the People&#x27;s Commissar for Defence and a Marshal of the Soviet Union in May, replacing Marshal Voroshilov as the Minister of Defence.

British historian John Erickson has written:

Although by no means a military intellectual, Timoshenko had at least passed through the higher command courses of the Red Army and was a fully trained &#x27;commander-commissar&#x27;. During the critical period of the military purge, Stalin had used Timoshenko as a military district commander who could hold key appointments while their incumbents were liquidated or exiled.
Timoshenko was a competent but traditionalist military commander who nonetheless saw the urgent need to modernise the Red Army if, as expected, it was to fight a war against Nazi Germany. Overcoming the opposition of other more conservative leaders, he undertook the mechanisation of the Red Army and the production of more tanks. He also reintroduced much of the traditional harsh discipline of the Tsarist Russian Army.

In June 1940, Timoshenko ordered the formation of the Baltic Military District in the occupied Baltic states.

===World War II===

==== 1941–1942 ====
In the weeks before the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Timoshenko and Zhukov were worried by reports that German planes were crossing the Soviet border at least 10 times a day, and on 13 June, they asked Stalin for permission to put the troops on the western border on high alert, but were overruled because Stalin was convinced that there would be no German invasion before spring 1942.

General Ivan Boldin, deputy commander on the western front, recounted in memoirs published 20 years later that early in the morning of the invasion, on 22 June, when several towns in Belarus, including Grodno, were being bombed, aircraft destroyed on the ground, troops were being strafed, and German paratroopers were landing behind Red Army lines, Timoshenko rang him with an instruction that &quot;no action is to be taken against the Germans without our knowledge ... Comrade Stalin has forbidden to open artillery fire against the Germans&quot;.
On 23 June, Timoshenko was named chairman of Stavka, the Soviet Armed Forces High Command. In July 1941, Stalin replaced Timoshenko as Defense Commissar and Stavka&#x27;s chairman. At the same time, the Western Front was divided into three sectors, with Timoshenko put in command of the Central Front to supervise a fighting retreat from the border to Smolensk. The Northern Front was commanded by Voroshilov, and the Southwestern Front by Budyonny, both of whom were removed by Stalin for incompetence after only a few weeks. Timoshenko was transferred to Ukraine in September to replace Budyonny and restore order at the gates of Kiev. On 23 October, the Soviets made Timoshenko command the entire southern half of the Eastern Front and Georgy Zhukov command the northern half. In November and December 1941, Timoshenko organized major counter offensives in the Rostov region, as well as carving a bridgehead into German defenses south of Kharkiv in January 1942.

In May 1942, Timoshenko, with 640,000 men, launched a counter-offensive (the Second Battle of Kharkov), which was the first Soviet attempt to gain initiative in the springtime war. After initial Soviet successes, the Germans struck back at Timoshenko&#x27;s exposed southern flank, halting the offensive, encircling Timoshenko&#x27;s armies, and turning the battle into a major Soviet defeat.

The fact that he was the most senior Soviet army officer with a front-line command during most of the first year after the German invasion turned Timoshenko, briefly, into an international celebrity, lionised in the US and UK in particular as a supposed military genius. According to an account written later in the war:
 
General Georgy Zhukov&#x27;s success in defending Moscow during December 1941 had persuaded Stalin that he was a better commander than Timoshenko. On 22 July 1942, Stalin replaced Timoshenko with Vasily Gordov as Commander of the Stalingrad Front due to his failures up to that point in the war, making him &quot;Chairman of the High Command&quot;. He was called back into service as overall commander of the Northwestern Front between October 1942 and March 1943.

==== 1943–1945 ====
Nonetheless, Timoshenko continued active military action in the later phase of the war. From March 1943, he was appointed as a representative of the Stavka to coordinate the actions of a number of fronts. He took part in the development and conduct of some operations. From March to June 1943, Timoshenko coordinated the Volkhov and Leningrad fronts during the battles at the Leningrad sector. By December 1943, he had coordinated the North Caucasian Front and the Black Sea Fleet, oversaw the liberation of the North Caucasus and Novorossiysk, the landing operation in Kerch Peninsula, paving the way for the liberation of Crimea later. From February to June 1944, he oversaw the actions of 2nd and 3rd Baltic fronts, including the Starorussko-Novorzhevskaya operation. From August 1944 until the end of the war, he coordinated the actions of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Ukrainian fronts.

Timoshenko was awarded his first Order of Suvorov, 1st class, due to the achievements in the Caucasus and the bridgehead in Crimea. After the Red Army liberated Chișinău on 25 August during the Jassy–Kishinev offensive, Timoshenko sent a telegram to Stalin that praised the achievement of the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian fronts under his coordination and requested the promotion of their respective commanders, Malinovsky and Tolbukhin, to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union. The commanders were indeed promoted, and Timoshenko was also awarded another Order of Suvorov, 1st class. On 4 June 1945, Timoshenko was awarded the Order of Victory for his contributions in the war.

In 1945, Timoshenko attended the Yalta Conference. A rumor started in the Western press that Stalin had attacked Timoshenko, but this was later disproved.

Between 15 August 1945 and 15 September 1945, Timoshenko travelled alone to review the Starye Dorogi displaced persons camp where Auschwitz concentration camp survivors recuperated after their liberation. Later, the author Primo Levi (Prisoner 174517) wrote in &quot;The Truce&quot; of how the extremely tall Timoshenko &quot;unfolded himself from a tiny Fiat 500A Topolino&quot; to announce that the liberated survivors would soon begin their final journey home.

===Postwar and death===
After the war, Timoshenko was reappointed commander of the Baranovichi Military District (Byelorussian Military District since March 1946), then of the South Urals Military District (June 1946); and then the Byelorussian Military District once again (March 1949). In 1960, he was appointed Inspector-General of the Defence Ministry, a largely honorary post. From 1961 he chaired the State Committee for War Veterans.

Timoshenko died at Moscow on 31 March 1970 at the age of 75. He was honoured with a state funeral and was cremated on 3 April. The urn containing his ashes was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

== Assessment ==

Timoshenko was highly praised by his contemporary Marshal Georgy Zhukov. During a discussion with Stalin in 1941, Zhukov praised Timoshenko&#x27;s conducts at Smolensk sector, claimed that he had done everything he could and gained the trust of the soldiers. After the war, Zhukov repeated his praise during an interview with Konstantin Simonov, claimed that Timoshenko was a strong-willed, educated and experienced military man. He was removed from the frontline duty not because of his capability, but mainly because people were upset with his defeat at Kharkov and Timoshenko himself did not attempt to curry favour with his superior.

General A.P. Pokrovsky, also in an interview with Simonov, gave a more multidimensional assessment of Timoshenko. Pokrovsky praised Timoshenko as a well-trained, hard-working commander and was proficient in military matters. However, Timoshenko had a deep distrust of the personnel of the Stavka, therefore he also worked with a separated group of trusted associates and double-checked the data gathered by both the Stavka group and his own group. Pokrovsky commented that Timoshenko&#x27;s method was &quot;abnormal&quot; although his desire for accurate information was reasonable. Sergei Shtemenko in his memoirs also recounted Timoshenko&#x27;s hostile attitude towards High Command&#x27;s personnel including Shtemenko himself, however, their mutual relationship finally improved after some time working together.

There was a Marshala Tymoshenko Street in (the capital of Ukraine) Kyiv&#x27;s Obolonskyi District. On 27 October 2022 the Kyiv City Council renamed this street to Levko Lukianenko Street.

During the war with Poland, Isaac Babel rode with a cavalry unit commanded by Timoshenko, who was then aged 25, and who appeared as a named character in at least two of the stories that Babel wrote about his war experiences, one of which was originally published in Odessa under the title &quot;Timoshenko and Melnikov&quot;. When the stories were republished, his name was changed to Savitsky, after Budyonny had denounced Babel&#x27;s work as &quot;slander&quot; by a &quot;literary degenerate&quot;. Babel&#x27;s story &quot;My First Goose&quot; opens with this description:

In Babel&#x27;s &quot;The Story of a Horse&quot;, originally &quot;Timoshenko and Melnikov&quot;, &quot;Savitsky&quot; is described as having been removed from his command, and living with a Cossack woman, and is accused of having taken a white stallion that belonged a rival officer, who tries in vain to get it back.

In the Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;Russian Rhapsody&quot;, a caricature of Adolf Hitler referred to Timoshenko as &quot;that Irish general, Tim O&#x27;Shenko&quot;.

<doc id="290690" wikidata="Q3586370" url="?curid=290690" title="2003 Nova Scotia general election">
<text>The 2003 Nova Scotia general election was held on August 5, 2003, to elect members of the 59th House of Assembly of the Province of Nova Scotia, Canada. The ruling Progressive Conservative Party, led by Premier John Hamm, was reduced to a minority government.

==Campaign==
The election was called by Progressive Conservatives, who decided to hold a rare summer election in the hope of strengthening their hold on the legislature. Running against them were the New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Darrell Dexter, and the Liberal Party, led by Danny Graham.

Hamm&#x27;s party ran on a policy of fiscal management, tax cuts, and on their record of fulfilling most of their promises. While the NDP agreed in principle to tax cuts, their main cause was the creation of a public auto insurance company. The Liberals were the only party to criticize the tax cuts.

For the most part, the campaign was quiet and uneventful. Hamm received criticism for a great number of spending programs, including a $150 tax rebate cheque sent to Nova Scotians right before the election. The party was also criticized for holding an election in the summer when most people have other concerns. Darrell Dexter&#x27;s friendly, non-confrontational style, was popular with many voters, and was a marked change from his party&#x27;s usually strident socialism. Danny Graham, a young leader, was popular, but failed to make much of a mark.

The election was considered a mild failure for the Liberals and Progressive 
Conservatives, and something of a success for the NDP.

This election is also notable for being one of the last Canadian provincial elections in which British subjects could vote (a tiny number can still vote provincially in Saskatchewan if they were qualified in 1971).

<text>Lu Muzhen (30 July 18677 September 1952) was the first wife of Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen. A traditional Chinese housewife, she had two daughters, Wan and Yan, and one son, Fo, with his husband. Sun divorced with her after 30 years of marriage, in order to marry Soong Ching-ling in 1915. Since their divorce, Lu began living in Portuguese Macau until her death in 1952.

==Early life==
Lu Muzhen was born on 30 July 1867 into a wealthy family in Waibo Village, Xiangshan County, Guangdong, China. Her father, Lu Yaoxian, was a successful businessman in Honolulu, Hawaii. Raised as a traditional Chinese woman, Lu Muzhen had bound feet, excelled in needlework, and upheld strong filial piety. She married Sun Yat-sen on 26 May 1885, under the arrangement of their parents. Initially, Sun was displeased with the arrangement but changed his view in 1888 when Lu devotedly cared for his gravely ill father. This act of kindness moved Sun, and the couple grew closer, eventually having one son and two daughters.

During Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s revolutionary pursuits, Lu Muzhen remained in China to care for their parents and children. In November 1895, after the Guangzhou Uprising plot was uncovered by the Qing government, Sun&#x27;s family faced political persecution. Lu Muzhen took their children and Sun&#x27;s mother, Madam Yang, to Honolulu to seek refuge with her brother-in-law, Sun Mei. When Sun Mei declared bankruptcy due to his financial support for the revolution, the family relocated to Ngau Chi Wan in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Sun Fo was left alone in Honolulu to continue his study.

On 19 July 1910, the mother of Sun Yat-sen, Madame Yang, died in Hong Kong. In August 1910, Sun began planning the Second Guangzhou Uprising in Penang, Malaya. Lu Muzhen brought their two daughters to join him in Penang. However, three months later, Sun was expelled by the local authorities, leaving Lu and the children behind. Struggling without an income, they relied on donations from overseas Chinese communities to survive.

== First Lady ==
After the 1911 Revolution, Sun Yat-sen was elected the Provisional President of the new Chinese republic in early 1912. Lu Muzhen travelled from Penang to Shanghai and Nanjing, hoping to reunite with Sun Yat-sen. She was warmly received during her journey and honoured as the &quot;Mother of the Nation.&quot; However, Sun Yat-sen’s political commitments left little time for their family life. 

Lu left Sun and their daughters in Nanjing and returned to their hometown in Cuiheng. In May, Sun returned to Cuiheng, after which the couple toured Guangzhou and Beijing. Starting from 1912, Lu settled in Macau alongside Chen Cuifen, Sun’s concubine. In June 1913, Sun visited Macau to see their ailing daughter, Sun Wan.

In 1913, Sun Yat-sen left for Japan to inspect railway construction, and Lu followed and met him in March. After Sun began plotting a new revolution against Yuan Shikai, Lu left him and returned to Macau. She became a Christian in Honolulu, Hawaii on 14 April 1915.

== Divorce ==
Sun Yat-sen fell in love with Soong Ching-ling during their stay in Japan. Soong was born to a prestigious family, so she did not agree to be a mistress only. Therefore, Sun wrote to Lu, requesting her permission to divorce. Most people disagreed with Sun&#x27;s marriage with Soong Ching-ling. However, Lu agreed and remarked,

In late 1915, Lu left Macau for Tokyo to discuss divorce with Sun. She believed that she was a foot-bound illiterate woman, who was far less capable than college-educated Soong Ching-ling. Therefore she agree to end their 32-year marriage. 

== After divorce ==

After the divorce, she returned to Macau via Penang and lived in Macau ever since. When Sun Yat-sen died in 1925, although she was not invited to the official funeral, she mourned him with traditional Chinese funeral services at her home. In August 1930, her residence suffered from an arsenal explosion, which the Macau government made compensation. Sun Fo thus rebuilt the residence for his mother. 

She died in Macau on 7 September 1952. 

== Memorial ==
After her death, her residence was first handed over the Macau Post and then the Mainland Affairs Council of Taiwan and currently managed by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Macau as the Sun Yat Sen Memorial House.

Moroni means &quot;at the river&quot; (&quot;mroni&quot; in Shingazidja). Moroni is the capital of the semi-autonomous island of Ngazidja, the largest of the three main islands of the republic. The city&#x27;s estimated population in 2003 was 41,557 residents. Moroni, which lies along the Route Nationale 1, has a port and several mosques such as the Badjanani Mosque.

==History==

The early history of Moroni is uncertain. The earliest written evidence for settlement in the Comoros Islands comes no earlier than the 7th century, possibly by Arab navigations and Bantu-speaking agriculturalists, while ceramic finds from the 7th to 10th century demonstrate that the Islands were part of the developing Swahili civilization, but when Moroni itself was first settled is not known.

By the middle of the second millennium, however, Moroni was a well-established town, engaged in trade networks throughout the Indian Ocean, and the Badjanani mosque, built in 1427, is a testament to the city&#x27;s wealth, contemporary with the golden ages of other Swahili cities. Together with neighbouring port and royal capital Ikoni, Moroni was one of two centres of economic and political power of the kingdom of Bambao. Nevertheless, until the end of the nineteenth century, it was just one of many large towns on the island, and it wasn&#x27;t until the Sultan of Bambao, Said Ali ibn Said Omar, negotiated a treaty of Protectorate with France in 1886 that his town became the seat of the colonial administration.

Moroni grew slowly through the twentieth century for, although it was now the capital of Ngazidja, it was not the seat of the territorial administration, which was located at Dzaoudzi on Mayotte, and in 1958 its population was still only 6,545. However, in that same year the decision was taken to move the capital of the archipelago from Dzaoudzi to Moroni, and the town slowly grew to become the largest in the country.

An agreement on broad autonomy to the three islands was refused by the Anjouan representatives which resulted in an eruption of violence affecting Moroni in April 1999, during which Colonel Azali Assoumani assumed power in a coup d&#x27;état. In December 2003, the Moroni Agreement on Transition Agreements was signed by the island presidents of the Union of Comoros. In the run-up to the 2006 elections, the government-owned Radio Ngazidja and private station Moroni FM were raided by armed assailants and forced off the air temporarily. In 2010, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Seabees constructed Hamramba School in Moroni as a humanitarian project, in partnership with the local military and Comoros&#x27; federal government; construction methods included mixing concrete by hand before using buckets and wheelbarrows to move the concrete to the school site.

== Geography ==

The city is on the western coast of Ngazidja. Moroni has a rocky volcanic coastline, mostly without beaches. Settlements to the north of Moroni include Itsandra, Ntsoudjini, Ouellah, Bahani, Batsa, Vanambouani and Vanadjou, and to the south are Ikoni, Mvouni, Daoueni and Selea.

=== Landmarks ===
The historic town centre, the Medina, contains a maze of narrow alleys and ancient buildings but is poorly maintained. The old city centre is similar to but smaller than the old town of Lamu. There are many mosques, notably the Badjanani Mosque or &quot;Ancienne Mosquée de Vendredi&quot; (old Friday mosque), which is the oldest mosque in the Medina. It was originally built in 1427, and a minaret was added in 1921. The 300-seat theatre of the Alliance Franco-Comorienne serves as a venue for national and international performances, ceremonies, conferences, film screenings, and seminars. Other venues include the 700-seat Al-Kamar, the 500-seat Palais du Peuple, and the 300-seat Foyer des Jeunes de Foumbouni. 

Moroni has a few hotels and nightclubs. The nearby Karthala volcano is also an attraction for hiking when the volcano is dormant.

=== Climate ===
Moroni features a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;), with generally heavy precipitation throughout the year—only October sees on average less than of rain (roughly ). The average annual rainfall is and it rains during all months of the year. The monsoon season lasts from November to April. Humidity is in the range of 69 to 79 per cent. Moroni&#x27;s average temperatures throughout the year are relatively constant with a high in the range of and a low in the range of . The region experiences frequent cyclones and as the islands are located more than 10 degrees below the equator in the western part of the Indian Ocean, the climate is generally termed as &quot;maritime tropical&quot;.

==== Mount Karthala ====

Moroni is situated at the foot of Mount Karthala, northwest of the volcano&#x27;s crater. The high active volcano is reported to be one of the largest active volcanoes in the world, with a diameter of about , and erupting approximately every eleven years over the past two hundred years. The eruption of 2005 caused displacement of a large number of people due to volcanic ash.

==== Wildlife ====
The volcano which forms the backdrop of Moroni city has numerous bird species including Comoro pigeon, Karthala scops owl, Comoro cuckoo-roller, Comoro drongo, Comoro thrush, Comoro bulbul, Humblot&#x27;s flycatcher, Comoro cuckoo-shrike, Kirk&#x27;s white-eye, Karthala white-eye, Comoro brush-warbler, Comoro green sunbird, and Comoro fody. 

== Demographics ==
, Moroni had a population of about 54,000. Sunni Muslims account for 98%, and there is a minority of Roman Catholics. The official languages of the Comoros are Shikomori (a Bantu language closely related to Swahili), Arabic and French.

== Places of worship == 
Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples : Apostolic Vicariate of the Comoros Archipelago (Catholic Church), Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.

== Economy ==
Goods produced on the island are vanilla, soft drinks, processed and distilled essential oils, metal and wood products, and processed pozzolana (cement); these are exported from the port. The tourist infrastructure is poorly developed. Financial institutions include Banque Centrale des Comores, Banque de Development des Comores, and Banque pour Industries et le Commerce. There are several markets in Moroni, including the old market and the larger market at Volo Volo in the north of the city.

== Transport ==
The country&#x27;s civil aviation authority, Ministère des Postes et Télécommunications de la Promotion des Nouvelles Technologies de l&#x27;Information et de la Communication chargé des Transports et du Tourisme, is located in Moroni, as is the National Agency of Civil Aviation and Meteorology. 
Moroni is served by the Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport, located at Hahaya, about north of the town. However, there are no direct flights to Europe. It is a civilian airport at an elevation of and has a paved runway which has dimensions of . Airlines which operate international flights to this airport are Ethiopian airlines, Air Tanzania, Air Austral and Kenya Airways. However, between the islands, the local airlines, Int&#x27;Air Iles and AB Aviation operate.

On 30 June 2009, Yemenia Flight 626, en route from Yemen to Moroni, crashed into the Indian Ocean with 153 passengers and crew on board, many from France.

There is a major harbour though small in size with regular transport to the African mainland and the other islands in the Comoros archipelago, as well as Madagascar and other Indian Ocean islands. The port is a small quay of with a draught of , and hence is not suitable for large ships to enter as coral reefs pose a threat to safety. It supports a maximum vessel size of . The channel depth is , with an anchorage depth of , a cargo pier depth of and a terminal depth of . Within the harbour&#x27;s mini industrial zone, a local container terminal was managed by Gulfcom Port Management SA between 2006 and 2012, after which Bolloré Africa Logistics won the concession and will partner with Cofipri, a Luxembourg investment company. Storage facilities such as warehouses have been established to facilitate imports and exports and also for petroleum storage.

<doc id="290720" wikidata="Q3544059" url="?curid=290720" title="Peter Dodds McCormick">
<text>Peter Dodds McCormick (28 January 183330 October 1916) was an Australian schoolteacher and songwriter, known for composing the Australian national anthem, &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;. He published under the pseudonym Amicus, Latin for &quot;friend&quot;.

==Early life==
Peter Dodds McCormick was born to Peter McCormick and Janet () at Port Glasgow, Scotland in 1833.

== Biography ==
Peter completed an apprenticeship as a joiner in Scotland before emigrating to Sydney (at that time the principal city of the British colony of New South Wales) on 21 February 1855. He initially worked as a joiner for &quot;some years&quot;.

McCormick spent most of his work life employed by the NSW Education Department. In 1863 he was appointed teacher-in charge at St Mary&#x27;s National School. McCormick married Emily Boucher, a sewing teacher, on 16 July 1863, who died on 11 March 1866, aged 22. He remarried, to Emma Elizabeth Dening, on 22 December 1866. He also taught at the Presbyterian Denominational school in the Sydney suburb of Woolloomooloo in 1867. McCormick then moved to Dowling Plunkett Street Public School in 1878 where he remained until 1885.

McCormick was heavily involved in the Scottish Presbyterian Church and was active in a number of community and benevolent organisations. He began his involvement with Sydney&#x27;s St Stephen&#x27;s Church as a stonemason, working on the now demolished Phillip Street Church (where Martin Place now stands). The Rev Hugh Darling was so impressed with his singing on the job he asked him to join the choir. McCormick&#x27;s musical ability led him to becoming the precentor of the Presbyterian Church of NSW, which gave him the opportunity to conduct very large massed choirs. He was also convenor of the Presbyterian Church Assembly&#x27;s Committee on Psalmody.

Also a talented composer, he published around 30 patriotic and Scottish songs, some of which became very popular. Included in his collected works was &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, which was first performed in public by Andrew Fairfax at the St Andrew&#x27;s Day concert of the Highland Society on 30 November 1878.

&quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; became quite a popular patriotic song. The &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; described the music as bold and stirring, and the words &quot;decidedly patriotic&quot; – it was &quot;likely to become a popular favourite&quot;. Later under the pseudonym &quot;Amicus&quot; (which means &#x27;friend&#x27; in Latin), he had the music and four verses published by W. H. Paling &amp; Co. Ltd. The song quickly gained popularity and an amended version was sung by a choir of 10,000 at the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901. In 1907, the New South Wales Government awarded McCormick £100 for his patriotic composition which he registered for copyright in 1915.

In a letter to R. B. Fuller Esq., dated 1 August 1913, McCormick described the circumstances that inspired him to pen the lyrics of his famous song:

==Death==

McCormick died in 1916, aged 83, at his home, Clydebank, in the Sydney suburb of Waverley and he was buried at Rookwood Cemetery. He had no children; he was survived by his second wife Emma. His obituary in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; stated: &quot;Mr. McCormick established a reputation with the patriotic song, &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, which ... has come to be recognised as something in the nature of an Australian National Anthem&quot;.

The song was performed by massed bands at the Federal capital celebrations in Canberra in 1927. In 1984 it was formally declared as the Australian national anthem, replacing God Save the Queen.

<doc id="290728" wikidata="Q245774" url="?curid=290728" title="John Stevens (inventor, born 1749)">
<text>Col. John Stevens, III (June 26, 1749 – March 6, 1838) was an American lawyer, engineer, and inventor who constructed the first U.S. steam locomotive, first steam-powered ferry, and first U.S. commercial ferry service from his estate in Hoboken. He was influential in the creation of U.S. patent law.

==Early life==
Stevens was born June 26, 1749, in New York City, New York. He was the only son of John Stevens Jr. (1715–1792), a prominent state politician who served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, and Elizabeth Alexander (1726–1800). His sister, Mary Stevens (d. 1814), married Robert R. Livingston, the first Chancellor of the State of New York.

His maternal grandparents were James Alexander (1691–1756), the Attorney General of New Jersey, and Mary (née Spratt) Provoost Alexander (1693–1760), herself a prominent merchant in New York City. His paternal grandfather, John Stevens, emigrated from London England around 1695, and was married to Mary Campbell.

He graduated King&#x27;s College (which became Columbia University) in May 1768.

==Career==
After his graduation from King&#x27;s College, he studied law and was admitted to the bar of New York City in 1771. He practiced law in New York and lived across the river. At public auction, he bought from the state of New Jersey a piece of land which had been confiscated from a Tory landowner. The land, described as &quot;William Bayard&#x27;s farm at Hoebuck&quot; comprised approximately what is now the city of Hoboken. Stevens built his estate at Castle Point, on land that would later become the site of Stevens Institute of Technology (bequeathed by his son Edwin Augustus Stevens). During the 1830s, he developed the land around his estate into the Elysian Fields, a popular weekend recreational and entertainment destination for New Yorkers during the 19th century.

Stevens bought a farm in Dutchess County, New York from John Armstrong Jr. Armstrong had converted a barn into a two-story Federal style dwelling with twelve rooms. Stevens made improvements to the estate, including a half-mile race track. He later sold the property to John Church Cruger (1807–1879), husband of Euphemia Van Rensselaer, daughter of Stephen Van Rensselaer. The Crugers named the estate &quot;Annandale&quot;.

In 1776, at age 27, he was appointed a captain in Washington&#x27;s army in the American Revolutionary War. During the War, he was promoted to colonel and became Treasurer of New Jersey, serving from 1776 to 1779.

In 1789, Stevens was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

In 1790, Stevens petitioned Congress for a bill that would protect American inventors. Through his efforts, his bill became a law on April 10, 1790, which introduced the patent system as law in the United States, patent law.

In 1799, Stevens was named to the Board of Directors of the Manhattan Company. As one of the original stockholders and directors of The Manhattan Company, Stevens was appointed to a three-person committee, along with John B. Coles and Samuel Osgood, to explore the best ways to supply water to New York City. He ultimately became the company&#x27;s consulting engineer and succeeded in convincing his fellow directors that steam pumping engines should be used and installed.

===Steamboats===
In 1802, Stevens designed and a built a single screw steamboat using a rotary steam engine, a primitive single stage turbine. However, due to poor sealing, the design was abandoned and he would switch to using more conventional reciprocating engines for future steamboats.

In 1804, Stevens built the &quot;Little Juliana&quot;, a twin screwed steamboat. She was one of the first steamboats to incorporate twin screws and a high pressure steam engine. She successfully sailed down the Hudson in May 1804.

In 1806, he built the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, a steamboat that ultimately sailed from Hoboken to Philadelphia in 1809, thereby becoming the first steamship to successfully navigate the open ocean.

In October 1811, Stevens&#x27; ship the &quot;Juliana&quot; began operation as the first steam-powered ferry (service was between New York City, and Hoboken, New Jersey).

The first railroad charter in the U.S. was given to Stevens and others in 1815 for the New Jersey Railroad. The charter essentially gave Stevens and his partners, through the Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad, a monopoly on railroads in the state of New Jersey. In 1825, he designed and built a steam locomotive, which he operated on a circle of track at his estate in Hoboken, New Jersey.

==Personal life==

On October 17, 1782, he married Rachel Cox (1761–1839), the daughter of John Cox. She was a descendant of the Langeveldts (or Longfields) who originally settled New Brunswick, New Jersey. Together, they had thirteen children of which seven were sons. The children included:

* John Cox Stevens (1785–1857), first commodore of the New York Yacht Club who married Maria C. Livingston in 1809.
* Robert Livingston Stevens (1787–1856), applied the &quot;wave line&quot; to shipbuilding, and president of Camden and Amboy Railroad, the first railroad built in New Jersey.
* James Alexander Stevens (1790–1873)
* Richard Stevens (1792–1835)
* Francis Bowes Stevens (1793–1812)
* Edwin Augustus Stevens (1795–1868), the founder of Stevens Institute of Technology who married Mary Barton Picton and, after her death, Martha Bayard Dod
* Elizabeth Juliana Stevens (1797–1881), who married Thomas Anderson Conover (1791–1864)
* Mary Stevens (1799–1825), the first wife of Rear Admiral Joshua R. Sands (1795–1883)
* Harriet Stevens (1801–1844), the second wife of Joshua R. Sands
* Esther Bowes Stevens (b. 1804)
* Catherine Sophia Van Cortlandt Stevens (b. 1806)

Stevens died on March 6, 1838, at his estate in Hoboken, New Jersey.

<text>John Stevens Jr. (c. 1715 – May 10, 1792) was a prominent colonial American landowner, merchant, and politician.

==Early life==
Stevens was born in 1715 at Perth Amboy in the Province of New Jersey in what was then British America. He was the son of John Stevens Sr., who came to America in 1699 at the age of 17 as an indentured clerk, and his wife Ann Campbell.

==Career==

With his brother Richard, he owned mercantile vessels and commanded them on voyages to Madeira and the Caribbean between 1739 and 1743. He then settled in Perth Amboy, where he was a vestryman at St. Peter&#x27;s Church from 1749 to 1752. He was a large landowner in the New Jersey counties of Hunterdon, Union, and Somerset, and he owned a copper mine at Rocky Hill that was later abandoned.

===Colonial politics===
Stevens was a member of the New Jersey General Assembly in 1751. He served as paymaster of the 1st New Jersey Regiment (the &quot;Jersey Blues&quot;) under Colonel Peter Schuyler from 1756 to 1760. In 1758, he was appointed by the Assembly of New Jersey to serve as a commissioner to the state&#x27;s Indian tribes. In 1762, he was named a member of the New Jersey Provincial Council, a position that he resigned in 1770.
Stevens was a vocal opponent of the Stamp Act. When the act went into effect in 1765, he was one of a committee of four (with Robert Livingston, John Cruger Jr., and Beverly Robinson) to prevent the issue of stamps in New York City. In 1770, he was appointed a commissioner, along with Walter Rutherfurd, to establish the partition line between New York and New Jersey.

===Post-independence politics===
In 1776, after the Provincial Congress had become the New Jersey Legislature under the state&#x27;s first Constitution, Stevens was elected Vice-President of Council of New Jersey, holding the office of chairman of the joint meetings of the legislature until 1782, representing Hunterdon County. He was a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1784. He was president of the convention of New Jersey when the state ratified the United States Constitution on December 18, 1787.

==Personal life==
In 1748, he married Elizabeth Alexander (1720–1800), daughter of James Alexander (1691–1756), Surveyor General of New Jersey and New York and counsel for Peter Zenger, and Mary Spratt Alexander, a merchant in her own right. Together, they were the parents of two children:

* John Stevens III (1749–1838), who married Rachel Cox, a descendant of the Langeveldts who originally settled New Brunswick, New Jersey. Rachel was the daughter of John Cox, Esq. of Bloomsbury, New Jersey, and the sister of Elizabeth Cox, who married Horace Binney.
* Mary Stevens (1751–1814), who married Chancellor Robert R. Livingston (1746–1813), negotiator of the Louisiana Purchase.

His later years were spent with his son at Hoboken, where he died in May 1792. He was buried at the Frame Meeting House in Bethlehem Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey.

===Descendants===
Through his son John, he was the grandfather of thirteen grandchildren, including John Cox Stevens (1785–1857), first commodore of the New York Yacht Club, Robert Livingston Stevens (1787–1856), the president of Camden and Amboy Railroad, James Alexander Stevens (1790–1873), Richard Stevens (1792–1835), Francis Bowes Stevens (1793–1812), Edwin Augustus Stevens (1795–1868), founder of Stevens Institute of Technology, Elizabeth Juliana Stevens (1797–1821), Mary Stevens (1799–1825), who was the first wife of Rear Admiral Joshua R. Sands, Harriet Stevens (1801–1844), who was the second wife of Joshua R. Sands, Esther Bowes Stevens (b. 1804), and Catherine Sophia Van Cortlandt Stevens (b. 1806).

<doc id="290749" wikidata="Q62792" url="?curid=290749" title="Conch">
<text>Conch ( , ) is a common name of a number of different medium-to-large-sized sea snails. Conch shells typically have a high spire and a noticeable siphonal canal (in other words, the shell comes to a noticeable point on both ends).

Conches that are sometimes referred to as &quot;true conches&quot; are marine gastropods in the family Strombidae, specifically in the genus &quot;Strombus&quot; and other closely related genera. For example, &quot;Lobatus gigas&quot;, the queen conch, is a true conch. True conch are identified by their long spire. 

Many other species are also often called &quot;conch&quot;, but are not at all closely related to the family Strombidae, including &quot;Melongena&quot; species (family Melongenidae) and the horse conch &quot;Triplofusus papillosus&quot; (family Fasciolariidae). Species commonly referred to as conches also include the sacred chank or &quot;shankha&quot; shell (&quot;Turbinella pyrum&quot;) and other &quot;Turbinella&quot; species in the family Turbinellidae. The Triton&#x27;s trumpet (family Charoniidae) may also be fashioned into a horn and referred to as a conch.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;conch&quot; is attested in Middle English, coming from Latin (shellfish, mussel), which in turn comes from Greek (same meaning) ultimately from Proto-Indo-European root , cognate with Sanskrit word .

== General description ==
Conch are species of sea snail in the phylum Mollusca. Their shells consist of about 95% calcium carbonate and 5% organic matter. Conch are harvested for their edible meat and decorative shell. The shells are often used for decoration and as a musical instrument.

==Culinary use==

The meat of conches are often eaten raw in salads or cooked in burgers, chowders, fritters, and gumbos. Conch is indigenous to the Caribbean and West Indies. Conch is particularly popular in the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, and Jamaica. In Bahamas, conch is often cooked into fritters. In Jamaica conch is eaten in stews and curries. In the Dominican Republic, Grenada, and Haiti, conch is commonly eaten in curries or in a spicy soup. It is locally referred to as &quot;lambi&quot;. In Puerto Rico, conch is served as a &quot;ceviche&quot;, often called &quot;ensalada de carrucho&quot; (conch salad), consisting of raw conch marinated in lime juice, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, green peppers, and onions. It is also used to fill &quot;empanadas&quot;.

In Panama, conch is known as &quot;cambombia&quot; and is often served as &quot;ceviche de cambombia&quot;, consisting of raw conch marinated in lime juice, chopped onions, finely chopped habaneros, and often vinegar.

Conch is very popular in Italy and among Italian Americans. Called &quot;sconcigli&quot;, it is eaten in a variety of ways, but most often in salads or cooked in a sauce for pasta. It is often included as one of the dishes prepared for the Feast of the Seven Fishes.

In East Asian cuisines, conch is often cut into thin slices and then steamed or stir-fried.

Eighty per cent of the queen conch meat in international trade is imported into the United States. The Florida Keys were a major source of queen conches until the 1970s, but the conches are now scarce and all harvesting of them in Florida waters is prohibited and individuals who have harvested them have been punished by law enforcement.

===Festival===
In the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Conch Festival is held in November each year at the Three Queens Bar/Restaurant in Blue Hills. Local restaurateurs compete for the best and most original conch dishes, which are then judged by international chefs. Other competitions, events, and music performances occur.

==Musical instruments==

Conch shells can be used as wind instruments. They are prepared by cutting a hole in the spire of the shell near the apex and then blowing into the shell as if it were a trumpet, as a blowing horn. Sometimes a mouthpiece is used, but some shell trumpets are blown without one. Pitch is adjusted by moving one&#x27;s hand in and out of the aperture; the deeper the hand, the lower the note.

Various species of large marine gastropod shells can be turned into blowing shells, but some of the best-known species used are the sacred chank or &quot;shankha&quot; &quot;Turbinella pyrum&quot;, the Triton&#x27;s trumpet &quot;Charonia tritonis&quot;, and the queen conch &quot;Strombus gigas&quot;.

One of the most famous musical instruments was found in the Marsoulas cave in the Pyrenees Mountains, in France, in 1932. CT scans showed how ancient humans adapted the Concho to make it a musical instrument, such as creating a mouthpiece that was held together by an organic matter like clay or wax. Researchers from the Sorbonne, together with a professional horn player, were able to use it again as a musical instrument and play it.

Examples of this practice in the Americas can be seen in the form of historical artifacts at the Museo Larco in Lima, Peru, and Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City, Mexico.

==Pearls==

Many kinds of molluscs can produce pearls. Pearls from the queen conch, &quot;S. gigas&quot;, are rare and have been collectors&#x27; items since Victorian times. Conch pearls occur in a range of hues, including white, brown, and orange, with many intermediate shades, but pink is the colour most associated with the conch pearl, such that these pearls are sometimes referred to simply as &quot;pink pearls&quot;. In some gemological texts, non-nacreous gastropod pearls used to be referred to as &quot;calcareous concretions&quot; because they were porcellaneous (shiny and ceramic-like in appearance), rather than nacreous (with a pearly luster). The Gemological Institute of America and World Jewellery Confederation now use the simple term &quot;pearl&quot;—or, where appropriate, the more-descriptive term &quot;non-nacreous pearl&quot;—for such items, and, under Federal Trade Commission rules, various mollusk pearls may be referred to as &quot;pearls&quot; without qualification.

Although not nacreous, the surfaces of fine conch pearls have a unique appearance. The microstructure of conch pearls comprises partly aligned bundles of microcrystalline fibers that create a shimmering, slightly iridescent effect known as flame structure. The effect is a form of chatoyancy, caused by the interaction of light rays with the microcrystals in the pearl&#x27;s surface, and it somewhat resembles &quot;moiré&quot; silk.

==Other uses==

* Conch shells are used as biologically grown calcium carbonate fertilizer. 
* Conch shells are sometimes used as decoration, as decorative planters, and in cameo making.
* In the Aztec culture, the conch played an important role in rituals, war, art, music, mythology, festivals, and even the calendar.
* In India, some artisans make souvenirs, deity idols and other crafts by carving natural conch shells by hands.
* Conch shells have been used as shell money in several cultures.
* Some American Aboriginals used cylindrical conch columella beads as part of breastplates and other personal adornment.
* In India, the Bengali bride-to-be is adorned with conch shell and coral bangles called &quot;shakha paula&quot;. It is a traditional wedding ritual for every Bengali bride.
* In India and Bangladesh, the conch is blown every day in the evening in Bengali houses as a daily ritual.
* In some Afro-Caribbean and African-American cemeteries, conch shells are placed on graves.
* In some Caribbean countries such as Jamaica and the Bahamas, cleaned queen conch shells, or polished fragments, are sold, mainly to tourists, as souvenirs or in jewellery. Responding to a 2003 recommendation from CITES, some countries in the Caribbean have banned the export of queen conch shells. CITES has also asked all countries to ban import of these shells from countries that are not complying with CITES recommendations for managing the fishery. Queen conch fisheries have been closed in several countries. Conch shells or fragments taken home by tourists from noncomplying countries may be confiscated on return to the tourist&#x27;s home country while clearing customs. In the UK, conch shells are the 9th-most seized import.
*Conch shells have been used as a building material since ancient times, and new research is being conducted, to replicate their material for practical uses such as bone replacement, and also in architecture, to construct stronger structures.
* In Grenada, fishermen use the conch shell as a trombone to announce to the community that fish is available for sale. Conchs are used at carnival times in the Jouvert Jump where Diab Diab (Jab Jab) blow conch shells as part of the festivities. Especially in Guadeloupe, hearing conch shells being blown near ports at dawn and during Carnival times, too, is not uncommon. Many bands and trumpeters like Steve Turre use the conch shell in their performances.
* In the Caribbean, broken or up-turned conch shells are embedded into the tops of outdoor walls in an effort to maintain home security.
* In Tamil Nadu, India, the conch horn is blown during funerals as an acoustic indication of the funeral and to ward off evil spirits.
* In Key West, Florida, US, a native-born resident is affectionately called a &quot;conch&quot;.
* In Japan, a conch is &quot;horagai&quot; (or &quot;jinkai&quot;). It was used as a trumpet in special ceremonies such as a royal cremation during the Edo period.
*Conch shells, (&quot;pu&quot; in Hawaiian) have been historically used as a method of communication, a tradition that is still observed in parts of modern life in Hawai&#x27;i.

Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec god of wind and learning, wears around his neck the &quot;wind breastplate&quot; &quot;ehecailacocozcatl&quot;, &quot;the spirally voluted wind jewel&quot; made of a conch shell. Blowing a conch was considered a religious act.

===Hinduism===

A &quot;shankha&quot; shell (the shell of a &quot;T. pyrum&quot;, a species in the gastropod family Turbinellidae) is often referred to in the West as a conch shell or a chank shell. This shell is used as an important ritual object in Hinduism. The shell is used as a ceremonial trumpet, as part of religious practices, for example &quot;puja&quot;. The chank trumpet is sounded during worship at specific points, accompanied by ceremonial bells and singing. As it is an auspicious instrument, it is of purity and brilliance (Om, Devas, Brahman the Almighty Supreme creator, referred to in mantras, the Gayatri mantra explains a meditation on the brilliance of the sun), it is often played in a &quot;Lakshmi puja&quot; in temple or at home.

In the story of Dhruva, the divine conch plays a special part. The warriors of ancient India blew conch shells to announce battle, as is described in the beginning of the war of Kurukshetra, in the Hindu epic the Mahabharata.

The god of preservation, Vishnu, is said to hold a special conch, Panchajanya, that represents life, as it has come out of life-giving waters. According to Hindu mythology, Devas (gods) and Asuras (demons) once decided to churn the ocean to get a special divine nectar. This divine nectar, also known as &quot;amrit&quot;, was known to give immortality to whoever drank it. All the gods were on one side of it and the demons were on the other end. The churning (&quot;samudra manthan&quot;) produced a number of things from the ocean. One of the first things to come out of it was lethal poison called &quot;halahala&quot;. Everyone was terrified, as the poison was potent enough to destroy entire creation, so they went to Lord Shiva for protection and he consumed the poison to safeguard the universe. Lord Shiva took the poison in his mouth, but did not swallow it. &quot;Shankha&quot; also was one of divine objects that was obtained from &quot;samudra manthan.&quot;

Also, the sound of the conch is believed to drive away the evil spirits.

The blowing of the conch or &quot;the &quot;shankha&quot;&quot; needs a tremendous power and respiratory capacity. Hence, blowing it daily helps keep the lungs healthy.

A newlywed Bengali bride wears bangles called &quot;shakha paula&quot;, made from coral and conch-shell powder. They have been a part of Bengali custom and tradition. In an ancient era, the Bengali farming community is thought to have resided near the river. They collected conch shells and powdered them to create bangles. They also used red coral for the bangles. They gave these beautiful bangles to their wives, as they could not afford ivory bangles. They were also known as poor-man&#x27;s ivory, as they were cheap substitute for ivory bangles.

==Literature and the oral tradition==
* In the Hindu tradition, the conch shell is used in ceremony as the sound it makes is said to correspond with higher frequency universal sounds associated with music of the spheres.

<text>JumpStart (known as Jump Ahead in the United Kingdom) is an educational media franchise created for children, primarily consisting of educational games. The franchise began with independent developer Fanfare Software&#x27;s 1994 video game &quot;JumpStart Kindergarten&quot;. The series was expanded into other age groups and beyond games to include workbooks, direct-to-video films, mobile apps, and other media under the ownership of Knowledge Adventure, which later assumed the name JumpStart Games.

A &quot;JumpStart&quot; online virtual world was officially launched in March 2009, offering a blend of educational content and entertainment experiences. JumpStart Games later ended support for both their &quot;JumpStart&quot; and &quot;Math Blaster&quot; series and the studio was closed in July 2023.

== History ==
The origin of the &quot;JumpStart&quot; franchise can be traced back to its inaugural game, &quot;JumpStart Kindergarten&quot;, developed in 1994 by the independent developer Fanfare Software and published by Knowledge Adventure. This marked the inception of a series aimed at merging education and entertainment. Fanfare Software, recognized for developing &quot;JumpStart Kindergarten&quot;, along with subsequent titles such as &quot;JumpStart Preschool&quot; and &quot;JumpStart 1st Grade&quot;, was acquired by Knowledge Adventure in 1995. This acquisition expanded the franchise&#x27;s scope, enabling it to include higher-grade levels and subjects, fostering its educational growth.

The franchise embraced the digital landscape with the launch of &quot;JumpStart 3D Virtual World&quot; in 2009. This marked a significant shift, allowing the franchise to expand into online worlds, mobile apps, and other digital formats.
