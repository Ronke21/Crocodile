<text>John Martin Feeney (February 1, 1894 – August 31, 1973), better known as John Ford, was an American film director and producer. He is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers during the Golden Age of Hollywood, and was one of the first American directors to be recognized as an auteur. In a career of more than 50 years, he directed over 130 films between 1917 and 1970 (although most of his silent films are now lost), and received six Academy Awards including a record four wins for Best Director for &quot;The Informer&quot; (1935), &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940), &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941), and &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952).

Ford is renowned for his Westerns, such as &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939), &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; (1946), &quot;Fort Apache&quot; (1948), &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956), and &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; (1962); though he worked in many other genres, including comedies, period dramas, and documentaries. He made frequent use of location shooting and wide shots, in which his characters were framed against a vast, harsh, and rugged natural terrain. He is credited with launching the careers of some of Hollywood&#x27;s biggest stars during the 1930s, &#x27;40s, and &#x27;50s, including John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Maureen O&#x27;Hara and James Stewart.

Ford&#x27;s work was held in high regard by his contemporaries, with Akira Kurosawa, Orson Welles, Frank Capra, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Ingmar Bergman naming him one of the greatest directors of all time. Subsequent generations of directors, including many of the major figures of the New Hollywood movement, have cited his influence. The Harvard Film Archive writes that &quot;the breadth and measure of Ford&#x27;s major contributions to the Golden Age of Hollywood cinema, and to film language in general, remains somewhat difficult to discern... Rarely recognized in full are Ford&#x27;s great achievements as a consummate visual stylist and master storyteller.&quot;

==Early life==
Ford was born John Martin &quot;Jack&quot; (though he later often gave his given names as Seán Aloysius, sometimes with surname O&#x27;Feeny or Ó Fearna; an Irish language equivalent of Feeney) in Cape Elizabeth, Maine, to John Augustine Feeney and Barbara &quot;Abbey&quot; Curran, on February 1, 1894, (though he occasionally said 1895 and that date is erroneously inscribed on his tombstone). His father, John Augustine, was born in Spiddal, County Galway, Ireland, in 1854. Barbara Curran was born in the Aran Islands, in the town of Kilronan on the island of Inishmore (Inis Mór). John A. Feeney&#x27;s grandmother, Barbara Morris, was said to be a member of an impoverished branch of a family of the Irish nobility, the Morrises of Spiddal (headed at present by Lord Killanin).

John Augustine and Barbara Curran arrived in Boston and Portland respectively in May and June 1872. They filed their intentions to marry on July 31, 1875, and became American citizens five years later on September 11, 1880. The John Augustine Feeney family resided on Sheridan Street, in the Irish neighborhood of Munjoy Hill in Portland, Maine, and his father worked a variety of odd jobs to support the family—farming, fishing, a laborer for the gas company, saloon keeping, and an alderman. In interviews John Ford said that his family was well off, he said that they had a farm and his father fished. John and Barbara had eleven children: Mamie (Mary Agnes), born 1876; Delia (Edith), 1878–1881; Patrick; Francis Ford, 1881–1953; Bridget, 1883–1884; Barbara, born and died 1888; Edward, born 1889; Josephine, born 1891; Hannah (Joanna), born and died 1892; John Martin, 1894–1973; and Daniel, born and died 1896 (or 1898).

Feeney attended Portland High School, Portland, Maine, where he played fullback and defensive tackle. He earned the nickname &quot;Bull&quot; because, it is said, of the way he would lower his helmet and charge the line. A Portland pub, named &quot;Bull Feeney&#x27;s&quot; in his honor, was open from 2002 to 2023. He later moved to California, and in 1914 began working in film production as well as acting for his older brother Francis, adopting &quot;Jack Ford&quot; as a professional name. In addition to credited roles, he appeared uncredited as a Klansman in D. W. Griffith&#x27;s 1915 &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;.

He married Mary McBride Smith on July 3, 1920, and they had two children. His daughter Barbara was married to singer and actor Ken Curtis from 1952 to 1964. The marriage between Ford and Smith lasted for life despite various issues, one being that Ford was Catholic while she was a non-Catholic divorcée. What difficulty was caused by this is unclear as the level of Ford&#x27;s commitment to the Catholic faith is disputed. Another strain was Ford&#x27;s many extramarital relationships.

==Directing career==
Ford began his career in film after moving to California in July 1914. He followed in the footsteps of his multi-talented older brother Francis Ford, twelve years his senior, who had left home years earlier and had worked in vaudeville before becoming a movie actor. Francis played in hundreds of silent pictures for filmmakers such as Thomas Edison, Georges Méliès and Thomas Ince, eventually progressing to become a prominent Hollywood actor-writer-director with his own production company (101 Bison) at Universal.

Ford started out in his brother&#x27;s films as an assistant, handyman, stuntman and occasional actor, frequently doubling for his brother, whom he closely resembled. Francis gave his younger brother his first acting role in &quot;The Mysterious Rose&quot; (November 1914). Despite an often combative relationship, within three years Jack had progressed to become Francis&#x27; chief assistant and often worked as his cameraman. By the time Jack Ford was given his first break as a director, Francis&#x27; profile was declining and he ceased working as a director soon after.

Ford&#x27;s films used a &#x27;stock company&#x27; of actors, far more so than many directors. Many famous stars appeared in at least two or more Ford films, including Harry Carey Sr., (the star of 25 Ford silent films), Will Rogers, John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Maureen O&#x27;Hara, James Stewart, Woody Strode, Richard Widmark, Victor McLaglen, Vera Miles and Jeffrey Hunter. Many of his supporting actors appeared in multiple Ford films, often over a period of several decades, including Ben Johnson, Chill Wills, Andy Devine, Ward Bond, Grant Withers, Mae Marsh, Anna Lee, Harry Carey Jr., Ken Curtis, Frank Baker, Dolores del Río, Pedro Armendáriz, Hank Worden, John Qualen, Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Shields, John Carradine, O. Z. Whitehead and Carleton Young. Core members of this extended &#x27;troupe&#x27;, including Ward Bond, John Carradine, Harry Carey Jr., Mae Marsh, Frank Baker, and Ben Johnson, were informally known as the John Ford Stock Company.

Likewise, Ford enjoyed extended working relationships with his production team, and many of his crew worked with him for decades. He made numerous films with the same major collaborators, including producer and business partner Merian C. Cooper, scriptwriters Nunnally Johnson, Dudley Nichols and Frank S. Nugent, and cinematographers Ben F. Reynolds, John W. Brown and George Schneiderman (who between them shot most of Ford&#x27;s silent films), Joseph H. August, Gregg Toland, Winton Hoch, Charles Lawton Jr., Bert Glennon, Archie Stout and William H. Clothier. Most of Ford&#x27;s postwar films were edited by Jack Murray until the latter&#x27;s 1961 death. Otho Lovering, who had first worked with Ford on &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939), became Ford&#x27;s principal editor after Murray&#x27;s death.

===Silent era===
During his first decade as a director Ford worked on dozens of features (including many westerns) but only ten of the more than sixty silent films he made between 1917 and 1928 still survive in their entirety. However, prints of several Ford &#x27;silents&#x27; previously thought lost have been rediscovered in foreign film archives over recent years—in 2009 a trove of 75 Hollywood silent films was rediscovered in the New Zealand Film Archive, among which was the only surviving print of Ford&#x27;s 1927 silent comedy &quot;Upstream&quot;. The print was restored in New Zealand by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences before being returned to America, where it was given a &quot;Re-Premiere&quot; at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills on August 31, 2010, featuring a newly commissioned score by Michael Mortilla.

Throughout his career, Ford was one of the busiest directors in Hollywood, but he was extraordinarily productive in his first few years as a director—he made ten films in 1917, eight in 1918 and fifteen in 1919—and he directed a total of 62 shorts and features between 1917 and 1928, although he was not given a screen credit in most of his earliest films.

There is some uncertainty about the identity of Ford&#x27;s first film as director—film writer Ephraim Katz notes that Ford might have directed the four-part film &quot;Lucille the Waitress&quot; as early as 1914—but most sources cite his directorial début as the silent two-reeler &quot;The Tornado&quot;, released in March 1917. According to Ford&#x27;s own story, he was given the job by Universal boss Carl Laemmle who supposedly said, &quot;Give Jack Ford the job—he yells good&quot;. &quot;The Tornado&quot; was quickly followed by a string of two-reeler and three-reeler &quot;quickies&quot;—&quot;The Trail of Hate&quot;, &quot;The Scrapper&quot;, &quot;The Soul Herder&quot; and &quot;Cheyenne&#x27;s Pal&quot;; these were made over the space of a few months and each typically shot in just two or three days; all are now presumed lost. &quot;The Soul Herder&quot; is also notable as the beginning of Ford&#x27;s four-year, 25-film association with veteran writer-actor Harry Carey, who (with Ford&#x27;s brother Francis) was a strong early influence on the young director, as well as being one of the major influences on the screen persona of Ford&#x27;s protege John Wayne. Carey&#x27;s son Harry &quot;Dobe&quot; Carey Jr., who also became an actor, was one of Ford&#x27;s closest friends in later years and featured in many of his most celebrated westerns.

Ford&#x27;s first feature-length production was &quot;Straight Shooting&quot; (August 1917), which is also his earliest complete surviving film as director, and one of only three survivors from his twenty-six film collaboration with Harry Carey. In making the film Ford and Carey ignored studio orders and turned in five reels instead of two, and it was only through the intervention of Carl Laemmle that the film escaped being cut for its first release, although it was subsequently edited down to two reels for re-release in the late 1920s. Ford&#x27;s last film of 1917, &quot;Bucking Broadway&quot;, was long thought to have been lost, but in 2002 the only known surviving print was discovered in the archives of the French National Center for Cinematography and it has since been restored and digitized. Similarly, &quot;The Scarlet Drop&quot;, his 1918 film once thought lost, was rediscovered in a warehouse in Santiago, Chile.

Ford directed around 36 films over three years for Universal before moving to the William Fox studio in 1920; his first film for them was &quot;Just Pals&quot; (1920). His 1923 feature &quot;Cameo Kirby&quot;, starring screen idol John Gilbert—another of the few surviving Ford silents—marked his first directing credit under the name &quot;John Ford&quot;, rather than &quot;Jack Ford&quot;, as he had previously been credited.

Ford&#x27;s first major success as a director was the historical drama &quot;The Iron Horse&quot; (1924), an epic account of the building of the First transcontinental railroad. It was a large, long and difficult production, filmed on location in the Sierra Nevada. The logistics were enormous—two entire towns were constructed, there were 5000 extras, 100 cooks, 2000 rail layers, a cavalry regiment, 800 Native Americans, 1300 bison, 2000 horses, 10,000 cattle and 50,000 properties, including the original stagecoach used by Horace Greeley, Wild Bill Hickok&#x27;s derringer pistol and replicas of the &quot;Jupiter&quot; and &quot;119&quot; locomotives that met at Promontory Summit when the two ends of the line were joined on May 10, 1869.
Ford&#x27;s brother Eddie was a crew member and they fought constantly; on one occasion Eddie reportedly &quot;went after the old man with a pick handle&quot;. There was only a short synopsis written when filming began and Ford wrote and shot the film day by day. Production fell behind schedule, delayed by constant bad weather and the intense cold, and Fox executives repeatedly demanded results, but Ford would either tear up the telegrams or hold them up and have stunt gunman Edward &quot;Pardner&quot; Jones shoot holes through the sender&#x27;s name. Despite the pressure to halt the production, studio boss William Fox finally backed Ford and allowed him to finish the picture and his gamble paid off handsomely—&quot;The Iron Horse&quot; became one of the top-grossing films of the decade, taking over US$2 million worldwide, against a budget of $280,000.

Ford made a wide range of films in this period, and he became well known for his Western and &quot;frontier&quot; pictures, but the genre rapidly lost its appeal for major studios in the late 1920s. Ford&#x27;s last silent Western was &quot;3 Bad Men&quot; (1926), set during the Dakota land rush and filmed at Jackson Hole, Wyoming and in the Mojave Desert. It would be thirteen years before he made his next Western, &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, in 1939.

During the 1920s, Ford also served as president of the Motion Picture Directors Association, a forerunner to today&#x27;s Directors Guild of America.

===Talkies: 1928–1939===
Ford was one of the pioneer directors of sound films; he shot Fox&#x27;s first song sung on screen, for his film &quot;Mother Machree&quot; (1928) of which only four of the original seven reels survive; this film is also notable as the first Ford film to feature the young John Wayne (as an uncredited extra) and he appeared as an extra in several of Ford&#x27;s films over the next two years. Moreover, &quot;Hangman&#x27;s House&quot; (1928) is notable as it features John Wayne&#x27;s first confirmed onscreen appearance in a Ford film, playing an excitable spectator during the horse race sequence. 

Just before the studio converted to talkies, Fox gave a contract to the German director F. W. Murnau, and his film &quot;&quot; (1927), still highly regarded by critics, had a powerful effect on Ford. Murnau&#x27;s influence can be seen in many of Ford&#x27;s films of the late 1920s and early 1930s—&quot;Four Sons&quot; (1928), was filmed on some of the lavish sets left over from Murnau&#x27;s production.

In November that year, Ford directed Fox&#x27;s first all-talking dramatic featurette &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Barber&quot; (1928), a 3-reeler which is now considered a lost film. &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Barber&quot; was followed by his final two silent features &quot;Riley the Cop&quot; (1928) and &quot;Strong Boy&quot; (1929), starring Victor McLaglen; which were both released with synchronised music scores and sound effects, the latter is now lost (although Tag Gallagher&#x27;s book records that the only surviving copy of &quot;Strong Boy&quot;, a 35 mm nitrate print, was rumored to be held in a private collection in Australia). &quot;The Black Watch&quot; (1929), a colonial army adventure set in the Khyber Pass starring Victor McLaglen and Myrna Loy is Ford&#x27;s first all-talking feature; it was remade in 1954 by Henry King as &quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot;.

Ford&#x27;s output was fairly constant from 1928 to the start of World War II; he made five features in 1928 and then made either two or three films every year from 1929 to 1942, inclusive. Three films were released in 1929—&quot;Strong Boy&quot;, &quot;The Black Watch&quot; and &quot;Salute&quot;. His three films of 1930 were &quot;Men Without Women&quot;, &quot;Born Reckless&quot; and &quot;Up the River&quot;, which is notable as the debut film for both Spencer Tracy and Humphrey Bogart, who were both signed to Fox on Ford&#x27;s recommendation (but subsequently dropped). Ford&#x27;s films in 1931 were &quot;Seas Beneath&quot;, &quot;The Brat&quot; and &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;; the last-named, adapted from the Sinclair Lewis novel and starring Ronald Colman and Helen Hayes, marked Ford&#x27;s first Academy Awards recognition, with five nominations including Best Picture.

Ford&#x27;s efficiency and his ability to craft films combining artfulness with strong commercial appeal won him increasing renown. By 1940 he was acknowledged as one of the world&#x27;s foremost movie directors. His growing prestige was reflected in his remuneration—in 1920, when he moved to Fox, he was paid $300–600 per week. As his career took off in the mid-Twenties his annual income significantly increased. He earned nearly $134,000 in 1929, and made over $100,000 per annum &quot;every year&quot; from 1934 to 1941, earning a staggering $220,068 in 1938—more than double the salary of the U.S. president at that time (although this was still less than half the income of Carole Lombard, Hollywood&#x27;s highest-paid star of the 1930s, who was earning around $500,000 per year at the time).

With film production affected by the Depression, Ford made two films each in 1932 and 1933—&quot;Air Mail&quot; (made for Universal) with a young Ralph Bellamy and &quot;Flesh&quot; (for MGM) with Wallace Beery. In 1933, he returned to Fox for &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; and &quot;Doctor Bull&quot;, the first of his three films with Will Rogers.

The World War I desert drama &quot;The Lost Patrol&quot; (1934), based on the book &quot;Patrol&quot; by Philip MacDonald, was a superior remake of the 1929 silent film &quot;Lost Patrol&quot;. It starred Victor McLaglen as The Sergeant—the role played by his brother Cyril McLaglen in the earlier version—with Boris Karloff, Wallace Ford, Alan Hale and Reginald Denny (who went on to found a company that made radio-controlled target aircraft during World War II). It was one of Ford&#x27;s first big hits of the sound era—it was rated by both the National Board of Review and &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of the Top 10 films of that year and won an Oscar nomination for its stirring Max Steiner score. It was followed later that year by &quot;The World Moves On&quot; with Madeleine Carroll and Franchot Tone, and the highly successful &quot;Judge Priest&quot;, his second film with Will Rogers, which became one of the top-grossing films of the year.

Ford&#x27;s first film of 1935 (made for Columbia) was the mistaken-identity comedy &quot;The Whole Town&#x27;s Talking&quot; with Edward G. Robinson and Jean Arthur, released in the UK as &quot;Passport to Fame&quot;, and it drew critical praise. &quot;Steamboat Round The Bend&quot; was his third and final film with Will Rogers; it is probable they would have continued working together, but their collaboration was cut short by Rogers&#x27; untimely death in a plane crash in May 1935, which devastated Ford.

Ford confirmed his position in the top rank of American directors with the Murnau-influenced Irish Republican Army drama &quot;The Informer&quot; (1935), starring Victor McLaglen. It earned great critical praise, was nominated for Best Picture, won Ford his first Academy Award for Best Director, and was hailed at the time as one of the best films ever made, although its reputation has diminished considerably compared to other contenders like &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, or Ford&#x27;s own later &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956).

The politically charged &quot;The Prisoner of Shark Island&quot; (1936)—which marked the debut with Ford of long-serving &quot;Stock Company&quot; player John Carradine—explored the little-known story of Samuel Mudd, a physician who was caught up in the Abraham Lincoln assassination conspiracy and consigned to an offshore prison for treating the injured John Wilkes Booth. Other films of this period include the South Seas melodrama &quot;The Hurricane&quot; (1937) and the lighthearted Shirley Temple vehicle &quot;Wee Willie Winkie&quot; (1937), each of which had a first-year US gross of more than $1 million. During filming of &quot;Wee Willie Winkie&quot;, Ford had elaborate sets built on the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Calif., a heavily filmed location ranch most closely associated with serials and B-Westerns, which would become, along with Monument Valley, one of the director&#x27;s preferred filming locations, and a site to which Ford would return in the next few years for &quot;Stagecoach&quot; and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;.

The longer revised version of &quot;Directed by John Ford&quot; shown on Turner Classic Movies in November 2006 features directors Steven Spielberg, Clint Eastwood, and Martin Scorsese, who suggest that the string of classic films Ford directed during 1936 to 1941 was due in part to an intense six-month extramarital affair with Katharine Hepburn, the star of &quot;Mary of Scotland&quot; (1936), an Elizabethan costume drama.

===1939–1941===
&quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939) was Ford&#x27;s first western since &quot;3 Bad Men&quot; in 1926, and it was his first with sound. Orson Welles claimed that he watched &quot;Stagecoach&quot; forty times in preparation for making &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. It remains one of the most admired and imitated of all Hollywood movies, not least for its climactic stagecoach chase and the hair-raising horse-jumping scene, performed by the stuntman Yakima Canutt.

The Dudley Nichols–Ben Hecht screenplay was based on an Ernest Haycox story that Ford had spotted in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine and he purchased the screen rights for just $2500. Production chief Walter Wanger urged Ford to hire Gary Cooper and Marlene Dietrich for the lead roles, but eventually accepted Ford&#x27;s decision to cast Claire Trevor as Dallas and a virtual unknown, his friend John Wayne, as Ringo; Wanger reportedly had little further influence over the production.

In making &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, Ford faced entrenched industry prejudice about the now-hackneyed genre which he had helped to make so popular. Although low-budget western features and serials were still being churned out in large numbers by &quot;Poverty Row&quot; studios, the genre had fallen out of favor with the big studios during the 1930s and they were regarded as B-grade &quot;pulp&quot; movies at best. As a result, Ford shopped the project around Hollywood for almost a year, offering it unsuccessfully to both Joseph Kennedy and David O. Selznick before finally linking with Walter Wanger, an independent producer working through United Artists.

&quot;Stagecoach&quot; is significant for several reasons—it exploded industry prejudices by becoming both a critical and commercial hit, grossing over US$1 million in its first year (against a budget of just under $400,000), and its success (along with the 1939 Westerns &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; with James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich, Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;Union Pacific&quot; with Joel McCrea, and Michael Curtiz&#x27;s &quot;Dodge City&quot; with Erroll Flynn), revitalized the moribund genre, showing that Westerns could be &quot;intelligent, artful, great entertainment—and profitable&quot;. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won two Oscars, for Best Supporting Actor (Thomas Mitchell) and Best Score. &quot;Stagecoach&quot; became the first in the series of seven classic Ford Westerns filmed on location in Monument Valley, with additional footage shot at another of Ford&#x27;s favorite filming locations, the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Calif., where he had filmed much of &quot;Wee Willie Winkie&quot; two years earlier. Ford skillfully blended Iverson and Monument Valley to create the movie&#x27;s iconic images of the American West.

John Wayne had good reason to be grateful for Ford&#x27;s support; &quot;Stagecoach&quot; provided the actor with the career breakthrough that elevated him to international stardom. Over 35 years Wayne appeared in 24 of Ford&#x27;s films and three television episodes. Ford is credited with playing a major role in shaping Wayne&#x27;s screen image. Cast member Louise Platt, in a letter recounting the experience of the film&#x27;s production, quoted Ford saying of Wayne&#x27;s future in film: &quot;He&#x27;ll be the biggest star ever because he is the perfect &#x27;everyman.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Stagecoach&quot; marked the beginning of the most consistently successful phase of Ford&#x27;s career—in just two years between 1939 and 1941 he created a string of classics films that won numerous Academy Awards. Ford&#x27;s next film, the biopic &quot;Young Mr Lincoln&quot; (1939) starring Henry Fonda, was less successful than &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, attracting little critical attention and winning no awards. It was not a major box-office hit although it had a respectable domestic first-year gross of $750,000, but Ford scholar Tag Gallagher describes it as &quot;a deeper, more multi-leveled work than &quot;Stagecoach&quot; ... (which) seems in retrospect one of the finest prewar pictures&quot;.

&quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; (1939) was a lavish frontier drama co-starring Henry Fonda, Claudette Colbert and John Carradine; it was also Ford&#x27;s first movie in color and included uncredited script contributions by William Faulkner. It was a big box-office success, grossing $1.25 million in its first year in the US and earning Edna May Oliver a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her performance.

Despite its uncompromising humanist and political stance, Ford&#x27;s screen adaptation of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (scripted by Nunnally Johnson and photographed by Gregg Toland) was both a big box office hit and a major critical success, and it is still widely regarded as one of the best Hollywood films of the era. Noted critic Andrew Sarris described it as the movie that transformed Ford from &quot;a storyteller of the screen into America&#x27;s cinematic poet laureate&quot;. Ford&#x27;s third movie in a year and his third consecutive film with Fonda, it grossed $1.1 million in the US in its first year and won two Academy Awards—Ford&#x27;s second &#x27;Best Director&#x27; Oscar, and &#x27;Best Supporting Actress&#x27; for Jane Darwell&#x27;s tour-de-force portrayal of Ma Joad. During production, Ford returned to the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Calif., to film a number of key shots, including the pivotal image depicting the migrant family&#x27;s first full view of the fertile farmland of California, which was represented by the San Fernando Valley as seen from the Iverson Ranch.

&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; was followed by two less successful and lesser-known films. &quot;The Long Voyage Home&quot; (1940) was, like &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, made with Walter Wanger through United Artists. Adapted from four plays by Eugene O&#x27;Neill, it was scripted by Dudley Nichols and Ford, in consultation with O&#x27;Neill. Although not a significant box-office success (it grossed only $600,000 in its first year), it was critically praised and was nominated for seven Academy Awards—Best Picture, Best Screenplay, (Nichols), Best Music, Original Score (Richard Hageman), Best Photography (Gregg Toland), Best Editing (Sherman Todd), Best Effects (Ray Binger &amp; R.T. Layton), and Best Sound (Robert Parrish). It was one of Ford&#x27;s personal favorites; stills from it decorated his home and O&#x27;Neill also reportedly loved the film and screened it periodically.

&quot;Tobacco Road&quot; (1941) was a rural comedy scripted by Nunnally Johnson, adapted from the long-running Jack Kirkland stage version of the novel by Erskine Caldwell. It starred veteran actor Charley Grapewin and the supporting cast included Ford regulars Ward Bond and Mae Marsh, with Francis Ford in an uncredited bit part; it is also notable for early screen appearances by future stars Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews. Although not highly regarded by some critics—Tag Gallagher devotes only one short paragraph to it in his book on Ford—it was fairly successful at the box office, grossing $900,000 in its first year. The film was banned in Australia.

Ford&#x27;s last feature before America entered World War II was his screen adaptation of &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941), starring Walter Pidgeon, Maureen O&#x27;Hara and Roddy McDowall in his career-making role as Huw. The script was written by Philip Dunne from the best-selling novel by Richard Llewellyn. It was originally planned as a four-hour epic to rival &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;—the screen rights alone cost Fox $300,000—and was to have been filmed on location in Wales, but this was abandoned due to the heavy German bombing of Britain. A search of Southern California locations resulted in the set for the village being built on the grounds of the Crags Country Club (later the Fox ranch, now the core of Malibu Creek State Park). Another reported factor was the nervousness of Fox executives about the pro-union tone of the story. William Wyler was originally engaged to direct, but he left the project when Fox decided to film it in California; Ford was hired in his place and production was postponed for several months until he became available. Producer Darryl F. Zanuck had a strong influence over the movie and made several key decisions, including the idea of having the character of Huw narrate the film in voice-over (then a novel concept), and the decision that Huw&#x27;s character should not age (Tyrone Power was originally slated to play the adult Huw).

&quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; became one of the biggest films of 1941. It was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Supporting Actress (Sara Allgood), Best Editing, Best Script, Best Music and Best Sound and it won five Oscars—Best Director, Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Donald Crisp), Best B&amp;W Cinematography (Arthur C. Miller) and Best Art Direction/Interior Decoration. It was a huge hit with audiences, coming in behind &quot;Sergeant York&quot; as the second-highest-grossing film of the year in the US and taking almost $3 million against its sizable budget of $1,250,000. Ford was also named Best Director by the New York Film Critics, and this was one of the few awards of his career that he collected in person (he generally shunned the Oscar ceremony).

During World War II, Ford served as head of the photographic unit for the Office of Strategic Services and made documentaries for the Navy Department. He was commissioned as a commander in the United States Navy Reserve. According to Searching for John Ford, &quot;Ford and his men concentrated largely on secret photographic missions for the OSS.&quot; In 1961 Ford told a magazine, &quot;Our job was to photograph both for the records and for our intelligence assessment, the work of guerrillas, saboteurs, Resistance outfits.&quot; He won two more Academy Awards during this time, one for the semi-documentary &quot;The Battle of Midway&quot; (1942), and one for the propaganda film &quot;December 7: The Movie&quot; (1943). Ford filmed the Japanese attack on Midway from the power plant of Sand Island and was wounded in the left arm by a machine gun bullet.

Ford was also present on Omaha Beach on D-Day. He crossed the English Channel on the , which anchored off Omaha Beach at 0600. He observed the first wave land on the beach from the ship, landing on the beach himself later with a team of Coast Guard cameramen who filmed the battle from behind the beach obstacles, with Ford directing operations. The film was edited in London, but very little was released to the public. Ford explained in a 1964 interview that the US Government was &quot;afraid to show so many American casualties on the screen&quot;, adding that all of the D-Day film &quot;still exists in color in storage in Anacostia near Washington, D.C.&quot; Thirty years later, historian Stephen E. Ambrose reported that the Eisenhower Center had been unable to find the film. A film partially matching Ford&#x27;s description was unearthed by the U.S. National Archives in 2014. Other researchers assert that Ford did not personally land on Omaha Beach on D-Day (arriving rather a day or two later) and that John Ford&#x27;s D-Day footage is by and large a &quot;tall tale.&quot;

Ford eventually rose to become a top adviser to OSS head William Joseph Donovan. According to records released in 2008, Ford was cited by his superiors for bravery, taking a position to film one mission that was &quot;an obvious and clear target&quot;. He survived &quot;continuous attack and was wounded&quot; while he continued filming, one commendation in his file states. In 1945, Ford executed affidavits testifying to the integrity of films taken to document conditions at Nazi concentration camps.

His last wartime film was &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; (MGM, 1945), an account of America&#x27;s disastrous defeat in the Philippines, told from the viewpoint of a PT boat squadron and its commander. Ford created a part for the recovering Ward Bond, who needed money. Although he was seen throughout the movie, he never walked until they put in a part where he was shot in the leg. For the rest of the picture, he was able to use a crutch on the final march. Ford repeatedly declared that he disliked the film and had never watched it, complaining that he had been forced to make it, although it was strongly championed by filmmaker Lindsay Anderson. Released several months after the end of the war, it was among the year&#x27;s top 20 box-office draws, although Tag Gallagher notes that many critics have incorrectly claimed that it lost money.

===Post-war career===
After the war, Ford remained an officer in the United States Navy Reserve. He returned to active service during the Korean War, and was promoted to Rear Admiral the day he left service.

Ford directed sixteen features and several documentaries in the decade between 1946 and 1956. As with his pre-war career, his films alternated between (relative) box office flops and major successes, but most of his later films made a solid profit, and &quot;Fort Apache&quot;, &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;, &quot;Mogambo&quot; and &quot;The Searchers&quot; all ranked in the Top 20 box-office hits of their respective years.
Ford&#x27;s first postwar movie &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; (Fox, 1946) was a romanticized retelling of the primal Western legend of Wyatt Earp and the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, with exterior sequences filmed on location in the visually spectacular (but geographically inappropriate) Monument Valley. It reunited Ford with Henry Fonda (as Earp) and co-starred Victor Mature in one of his best roles as the consumptive, Shakespeare-loving Doc Holliday, with Ward Bond and Tim Holt as the Earp brothers, Linda Darnell as sultry saloon girl Chihuahua, a strong performance by Walter Brennan (in a rare villainous role) as the venomous Old Man Clanton, with Jane Darwell and an early screen appearance by John Ireland as Billy Clanton. In contrast to the string of successes in 1939–1941, it won no major American awards, although it was awarded a silver ribbon for Best Foreign Film in 1948 by the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists, and it was a solid financial success, grossing $2.75 million in the United States and $1.75 million internationally in its first year of release.

====Argosy years====

Refusing a lucrative contract offered by Zanuck at 20th Century Fox that would have guaranteed him $600,000 per year, Ford launched himself as an independent director-producer and made many of his films in this period with Argosy Pictures Corporation, which was a partnership between Ford and his old friend and colleague Merian C. Cooper. Ford and Cooper had previously been involved with the distinct Argosy Corporation, which was established after the success of &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939); Argosy Corporation produced one film, &quot;The Long Voyage Home&quot; (1940), before the Second World War intervened. &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1947), again starring Fonda, was the first project of Argosy Pictures. It was a loose adaptation of Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot;, which Ford had originally intended to make at Fox before the war, with Thomas Mitchell as the priest. Filmed on location in Mexico, it was photographed by distinguished Mexican cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa (who later worked with Luis Buñuel). The supporting cast included Dolores del Río, J. Carrol Naish, Ward Bond, Leo Carrillo and Mel Ferrer (making his screen début) and a cast of mainly Mexican extras. Ford reportedly considered this his best film but it fared relatively poorly compared to its predecessor, grossing only $750,000 in its first year. It also caused a rift between Ford and scriptwriter Dudley Nichols that brought about the end of their highly successful collaboration. Greene himself had a particular dislike of this adaptation of his work.

&quot;Fort Apache&quot; (Argosy/RKO, 1948) was the first part of Ford&#x27;s so-called &#x27;Cavalry Trilogy&#x27;, all of which were based on stories by James Warner Bellah. It featured many of his &#x27;Stock Company&#x27; of actors, including John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen, Mae Marsh, Francis Ford (as a bartender), Frank Baker, Ben Johnson and also featured Shirley Temple, in her final appearance for Ford and one of her last film appearances. It also marked the start of the long association between Ford and scriptwriter Frank S. Nugent, a former &quot;New York Times&quot; film critic who (like Dudley Nichols) had not written a movie script until hired by Ford. It was a big commercial success, grossing nearly $5 million worldwide in its first year and ranking in the Top 20 box office hits of 1948.

During that year Ford also assisted his friend and colleague Howard Hawks, who was having problems with his current film &quot;Red River&quot; (which starred John Wayne) and Ford reportedly made numerous editing suggestions, including the use of a narrator. &quot;Fort Apache&quot; was followed by another Western, &quot;3 Godfathers&quot;, a remake of a 1916 silent film starring Harry Carey (to whom Ford&#x27;s version was dedicated), which Ford had himself already remade in 1919 as &quot;Marked Men&quot;, also with Carey and thought lost. It starred John Wayne, Pedro Armendáriz and Harry &quot;Dobe&quot; Carey Jr (in one of his first major roles) as three outlaws who rescue a baby after his mother (Mildred Natwick) dies giving birth, with Ward Bond as the sheriff pursuing them. The recurrent theme of sacrifice can also be found in &quot;The Outcasts of Poker Flat&quot;, &quot;Three Godfathers&quot;, &quot;The Wallop&quot;, &quot;Desperate Trails&quot;, &quot;Hearts of Oak&quot;, &quot;Bad Men&quot;, &quot;Men without Women&quot;.

In 1949, Ford briefly returned to Fox to direct &quot;Pinky&quot;. He prepared the project but worked only one day before being taken ill, supposedly with shingles, and Elia Kazan replaced him (although Tag Gallagher suggests that Ford&#x27;s illness was a pretext for leaving the film, which Ford disliked).

His only completed film of that year was the second installment of his Cavalry Trilogy, &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; (Argosy/RKO, 1949), starring John Wayne and Joanne Dru, with Victor McLaglen, John Agar, Ben Johnson, Mildred Natwick and Harry Carey Jr. Again filmed on location in Monument Valley, it was widely acclaimed for its stunning Technicolor cinematography (including the famous cavalry scene filmed in front of an oncoming storm); it won Winton Hoch the 1950 Academy Award for Best Color Cinematography and it did big business on its first release, grossing more than $5 million worldwide. John Wayne, then 41, also received wide praise for his role as the 60-year-old Captain Nathan Brittles.

====1950s====
Ford&#x27;s first film of 1950 was the offbeat military comedy &quot;When Willie Comes Marching Home&quot;, starring Dan Dailey and Corinne Calvet, with William Demarest, from Preston Sturges &#x27;stock company&#x27;, and early (uncredited) screen appearances by Alan Hale Jr. and Vera Miles. It was followed by &quot;Wagon Master&quot;, starring Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr, which is particularly noteworthy as the only Ford film since 1930 that he scripted himself. It was subsequently adapted into the long-running TV series &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (with Ward Bond reprising the title role until his sudden death in 1960). Although it did far smaller business than most of his other films in this period, Ford cited &quot;Wagon Master&quot; as his personal favorite out of all his films, telling Peter Bogdanovich that it &quot;came closest to what I had hoped to achieve&quot;.

&quot;Rio Grande&quot; (Republic, 1950), the third part of the &#x27;Cavalry Trilogy&#x27;, co-starred John Wayne and Maureen O&#x27;Hara, with Wayne&#x27;s son Patrick Wayne making his screen debut (he appeared in several subsequent Ford pictures including &quot;The Searchers&quot;). It was made at the insistence of Republic Pictures, who demanded a profitable Western as the condition of backing Ford&#x27;s next project, &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;. A testament to Ford&#x27;s legendary efficiency, &quot;Rio Grande&quot; was shot in just 32 days, with only 352 takes from 335 camera setups, and it was a solid success, grossing $2.25 million in its first year.

Republic&#x27;s anxiety was erased by the resounding success of &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (Republic, 1952), a pet project which Ford had wanted to make since the 1930s (and almost did so in 1937 with an independent cooperative called Renowned Artists Company). It became his biggest grossing picture to date, taking nearly $4 million in the US alone in its first year and ranking in the top 10 box office films of its year. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won Ford his fourth Oscar for Best Director, as well a second Best Cinematography Oscar for Winton Hoch. It was followed by &quot;What Price Glory?&quot; (1952), a World War I drama, the first of two films Ford made with James Cagney (&quot;Mister Roberts&quot; was the other) which also did good business at the box office ($2 million).

&quot;The Sun Shines Bright&quot; (1953), Ford&#x27;s first entry in the Cannes Film Festival, was a western comedy-drama with Charles Winninger reviving the Judge Priest role made famous by Will Rogers in the 1930s. Ford later referred to it as one of his favorites, but it was poorly received, and was drastically cut (from 90 mins to 65 mins) by Republic soon after its release, with some excised scenes now presumed lost. It fared poorly at the box office and its failure contributed to the subsequent collapse of Argosy Pictures.

Ford&#x27;s next film was the romance-adventure &quot;Mogambo&quot; (MGM, 1953), a loose remake of the celebrated 1932 film &quot;Red Dust&quot;. Filmed on location in Africa, it was photographed by British cinematographer Freddie Young and starred Ford&#x27;s old friend Clark Gable, with Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly (who replaced an ailing Gene Tierney) and Donald Sinden. Although the production was difficult (exacerbated by the irritating presence of Gardner&#x27;s then husband Frank Sinatra), &quot;Mogambo&quot; became one of the biggest commercial hits of Ford&#x27;s career, with the highest domestic first-year gross of any of his films ($5.2 million); it also revitalized Gable&#x27;s waning career and earned Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress Oscar nominations for Gardner and Kelly (who was rumored to have had a brief affair with Gable during the making of the film).

In 1955, Ford made the lesser-known West Point drama &quot;The Long Gray Line&quot; for Columbia Pictures, the first of two Ford films to feature Tyrone Power, who had originally been slated to star as the adult Huw in &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; back in 1941. Later in 1955, Ford was hired by Warner Bros to direct the Naval comedy &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, starring Henry Fonda, Jack Lemmon, William Powell, and James Cagney, but there was conflict between Ford and Fonda, who had been playing the lead role on Broadway for the past seven years and had misgivings about Ford&#x27;s direction. During a three-way meeting with producer Leland Hayward to try and iron out the problems, Ford became enraged and punched Fonda on the jaw, knocking him across the room, an action that created a lasting rift between them. After the incident Ford became increasingly morose, drinking heavily and eventually retreating to his yacht, the &quot;Araner,&quot; and refusing to eat or see anyone. Production was shut down for five days and Ford sobered up, but soon after he suffered a ruptured gallbladder, necessitating emergency surgery, and he was replaced by Mervyn LeRoy.

Ford also made his first forays into television in 1955, directing two half-hour dramas for network TV. In the summer of 1955 he made &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; (Hal Roach Studios) for the TV series &quot;Studio Directors Playhouse&quot;; scripted by Frank S. Nugent, it featured Ford regulars John and Pat Wayne, Vera Miles and Ward Bond, with Ford himself appearing in the introduction. In November he made &quot;The Bamboo Cross&quot; (Lewman Ltd-Revue, 1955) for the &quot;Fireside Theater&quot; series; it starred Jane Wyman with an Asian-American cast and Stock Company veterans Frank Baker and Pat O&#x27;Malley in minor roles.

Ford returned to the big screen with &quot;The Searchers&quot; (Warner Bros, 1956), the only Western he made between 1950 and 1959, which is now widely regarded as not only one of his best films, but also by many as one of the greatest westerns, and one of the best performances of John Wayne&#x27;s career. Set in 1868 Texas but shot on location in Monument Valley Utah-Arizona, it tells of the embittered Civil War veteran Ethan Edwards who spends years tracking down his niece, kidnapped by Comanches as a young girl. The supporting cast included Jeffrey Hunter, Ward Bond, Vera Miles and rising star Natalie Wood. It was Hunter&#x27;s first film for Ford. It was very successful upon its first release and became one of the top 20 films of the year, grossing $4.45 million, although it received no Academy Award nominations. However, its reputation has grown greatly over the intervening years—it was named the Greatest Western of all time by the American Film Institute in 2008 and also placed 12th on the institute&#x27;s 2007 list of the Top 100 greatest movies of all time. &quot;The Searchers&quot; has exerted a wide influence on film and popular culture—it has inspired (and been directly quoted by) many filmmakers including David Lean and George Lucas, Wayne&#x27;s character&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;That&#x27;ll be the day&quot; inspired Texans Buddy Holly and his drummer Jerry Allison to pen their famous hit song of the same name, and the British pop group The Searchers also took their name from the film.

&quot;The Searchers&quot; was accompanied by one of the first &quot;making of&quot; documentaries, a four-part promotional program created for the &quot;Behind the Camera&quot; segment of the weekly &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot; TV show, (the studio&#x27;s first foray into TV) which aired on the ABC network in 1955–56. Presented by Gig Young, the four segments included interviews with Jeffrey Hunter and Natalie Wood and behind-the-scenes footage shot during the making of the film.

&quot;The Wings of Eagles&quot; (MGM, 1957) was a fictionalized biography of Ford&#x27;s old friend, aviator-turned-scriptwriter Frank &quot;Spig&quot; Wead, who had scripted several of Ford&#x27;s early sound films. It starred John Wayne and Maureen O&#x27;Hara, with Ward Bond as John Dodge (a character based on Ford himself). It was followed by one of Ford&#x27;s least known films, &quot;The Growler Story&quot;, a 29-minute dramatized documentary about the USS &quot;Growler&quot;. Made for the US Navy and filmed by the Pacific Fleet Command Combat Camera Group, it featured Ward Bond and Ken Curtis alongside real Navy personnel and their families.

Ford&#x27;s next two films stand somewhat apart from the rest of his films in terms of production, and he notably took no salary for either job. &quot;The Rising of the Moon&quot; (Warner Bros, 1957) was a three-part &#x27;omnibus&#x27; movie shot on location in Ireland and based on Irish short stories. It was made by Four Province Productions, a company established by Irish tycoon Lord Killanin, who had recently become Chair of the International Olympic Committee, and to whom Ford was distantly related. Killanin was also the actual (but uncredited) producer of &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;. The film failed to recoup its costs, earning less than half ($100,000) its negative cost of just over $256,000 and it stirred up some controversy in Ireland.

Both of Ford&#x27;s 1958 films were made for Columbia Pictures and both were significant departures from Ford&#x27;s norm. &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Day&quot; (titled &quot;Gideon of Scotland Yard&quot; in the US) was adapted from the novel by British writer John Creasey. It is Ford&#x27;s only police genre film, and one of the few Ford films set in the present day of the 1950s. It was shot in England with a British cast headed by Jack Hawkins, whom Ford (unusually) lauded as &quot;the finest dramatic actor with whom I have worked&quot;. It was poorly promoted by Columbia, who only distributed it in B&amp;W, although it was shot in color, and it too failed to make a profit in its first year, earning only $400,000 against its budget of $453,000.

&quot;The Last Hurrah&quot;, (Columbia, 1958), again set in present-day of the 1950s, starred Spencer Tracy, who had made his first film appearance in Ford&#x27;s &quot;Up The River&quot; in 1930. Tracy plays an aging politician fighting his last campaign, with Jeffrey Hunter as his nephew. Katharine Hepburn reportedly facilitated a rapprochement between the two men, ending a long-running feud, and she convinced Tracy to take the lead role, which had originally been offered to Orson Welles (but was turned down by Welles&#x27; agent without his knowledge, much to his chagrin). It did considerably better business than either of Ford&#x27;s two preceding films, grossing $950,000 in its first year although cast member Anna Lee stated that Ford was &quot;disappointed with the picture&quot; and that Columbia had not permitted him to supervise the editing.

&quot;Korea: Battleground for Liberty&quot; (1959), Ford&#x27;s second documentary on the Korean War, was made for the US Department of Defense as an orientation film for US soldiers stationed there.

It was followed by his last feature of the decade, &quot;The Horse Soldiers&quot; (Mirisch Company-United Artists, 1959), a heavily fictionalised Civil War story starring John Wayne, William Holden and Constance Towers. Although Ford professed unhappiness with the project, it was a commercial success, opening at #1 and ranking in the year&#x27;s Top 20 box-office hits, grossing $3.6 million in its first year, and earning Ford his highest-ever fee—$375,000, plus 10% of the gross. The production was reportedly a difficult one for director and cast, and it incurred significant cost overruns, exacerbated by the unprecedented salaries awarded to Holden and Wayne ($750,000, plus 20% of the overall profit, each). Mirroring the on-screen tensions between Wayne and Holden&#x27;s characters, the two actors argued constantly; Wayne was also struggling to help his wife Pilar overcome a barbiturate addiction, which climaxed with her attempted suicide while the couple were on location together in Louisiana. Ford&#x27;s problems peaked with the tragic death of stuntman Fred Kennedy, who suffered a fatal neck fracture while executing a horse fall during the climactic battle sequence. Ford was devastated by the accident and lost interest in the film, moving the production back to Hollywood. He also scrapped the planned ending, depicting the Marlowe&#x27;s triumphant entry into Baton Rouge, instead concluding the film with Marlowe&#x27;s farewell to Hannah Hunter and the crossing and demolition of the bridge.

===Last years, 1960–1973===
In his last years Ford was dogged by declining health, largely the result of decades of heavy drinking and smoking, and exacerbated by the wounds he suffered during the Battle of Midway. His vision, in particular, began to deteriorate rapidly and at one point he briefly lost his sight entirely; his prodigious memory also began to falter, making it necessary to rely more and more on assistants. His work was also restricted by the new regime in Hollywood, and he found it hard to get many projects made. By the 1960s he had been pigeonholed as a Western director and complained that he now found it almost impossible to get backing for projects in other genres.

&quot;Sergeant Rutledge&quot; (Ford Productions-Warner Bros, 1960) was Ford&#x27;s last cavalry film. Set in the 1880s, it tells the story of an African-American cavalryman (played by Woody Strode) who is wrongfully accused of raping and murdering a white girl. It was erroneously marketed as a suspense film by Warners and was not a commercial success. During 1960, Ford made his third TV production, &quot;The Colter Craven Story&quot;, a one-hour episode of the network TV show &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, which included footage from Ford&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Master&quot; (on which the series was based). He also visited the set of &quot;The Alamo&quot;, produced, directed by, and starring John Wayne, where his interference caused Wayne to send him out to film second-unit scenes which were never used (nor intended to be used) in the film.

&quot;Two Rode Together&quot; (Ford Productions-Columbia, 1961) co-starred James Stewart and Richard Widmark, with Shirley Jones and Stock Company regulars Andy Devine, Henry Brandon, Harry Carey Jr, Anna Lee, Woody Strode, Mae Marsh and Frank Baker, with an early screen appearance by Linda Cristal, who went on to star in the Western TV series &quot;The High Chaparral&quot;. It was a fair commercial success, grossing $1.6m in its first year.
&quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; (Ford Productions-Paramount, 1962) is frequently cited as the last great film of Ford&#x27;s career. Starring John Wayne and James Stewart, the supporting cast features leading lady Vera Miles, Edmond O&#x27;Brien as a loquacious newspaper publisher, Andy Devine as the inept marshal Appleyard, Denver Pyle, John Carradine, and Lee Marvin in a major role as the brutal Valance, with Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin as his henchmen. It is also notable as the film in which Wayne most often used his trademark phrase &quot;Pilgrim&quot; (his nickname for James Stewart&#x27;s character). The picture was very successful, grossing over $3 million in its first year, although the lead casting stretched credibility—the characters played by Stewart (then 53) and Wayne (then 54) could be assumed to be in their early 20s given the circumstances, and Ford reportedly considered casting a younger actor in Stewart&#x27;s role but feared it would highlight Wayne&#x27;s age. Though it is often claimed that budget constraints necessitated shooting most of the film on soundstages on the Paramount lot, studio accounting records show that this was part of the film&#x27;s original artistic concept, according to Ford biographer Joseph McBride. According to Lee Marvin in a filmed interview, Ford had fought hard to shoot the film in black-and-white to accentuate his use of shadows. Still, it was one of Ford&#x27;s most expensive films at US$3.2 million.

After completing &quot;Liberty Valance&quot;, Ford was hired to direct the Civil War section of MGM&#x27;s epic &quot;How The West Was Won&quot;, the first non-documentary film to use the Cinerama wide-screen process. Ford&#x27;s segment featured George Peppard, with Andy Devine, Russ Tamblyn, Harry Morgan as Ulysses S. Grant, and John Wayne as William Tecumseh Sherman. Wayne had already played Sherman in a 1960 episode of the television series &quot;Wagon Train&quot; that Ford directed in support of series star Ward Bond, &quot;The Coulter Craven Story&quot;, for which he brought in most of his stock company. Also in 1962, Ford directed his fourth and last TV production, &quot;Flashing Spikes&quot; a baseball story made for the &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot; series and starring James Stewart, Jack Warden, Patrick Wayne and Tige Andrews, with Harry Carey Jr. and a lengthy surprise appearance by John Wayne, billed in the credits as &quot;Michael Morris&quot;, as he also had been for the &quot;Wagon Train&quot; episode directed by Ford.

&quot;Donovan&#x27;s Reef&quot; (Paramount, 1963) was Ford&#x27;s last film with John Wayne. Filmed on location on the Hawaiian island of Kauai (doubling for a fictional island in French Polynesia), it was a morality play disguised as an action-comedy, which subtly but sharply engaged with issues of racial bigotry, corporate connivance, greed and American beliefs of societal superiority. The supporting cast included Lee Marvin, Elizabeth Allen, Jack Warden, Dorothy Lamour, and Cesar Romero. It was also Ford&#x27;s last commercial success, grossing $3.3 million against a budget of $2.6 million.

&quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot; (Warner Bros, 1964) was Ford&#x27;s epic farewell to the West, which he publicly declared to be an elegy to the Native American. It was his last Western, his longest film and the most expensive movie of his career ($4.2 million), but it failed to recoup its costs at the box office and lost about $1 million on its first release. The all-star cast was headed by Richard Widmark, with Carroll Baker, Karl Malden, Dolores del Río, Ricardo Montalbán, Gilbert Roland, Sal Mineo, James Stewart as Wyatt Earp, Arthur Kennedy as Doc Holliday, Edward G. Robinson, Patrick Wayne, Elizabeth Allen, Mike Mazurki and many of Ford&#x27;s faithful Stock Company, including John Carradine, Ken Curtis, Willis Bouchey, James Flavin, Danny Borzage, Harry Carey Jr., Chuck Hayward, Ben Johnson, Mae Marsh and Denver Pyle. William Clothier was nominated for a Best Cinematography Oscar and Gilbert Roland was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Cheyenne elder Dull Knife.

In 1965 Ford began work on &quot;Young Cassidy&quot; (MGM), a biographical drama based upon the life of Irish playwright Seán O&#x27;Casey, but he fell ill early in the production and was replaced by Jack Cardiff.

Ford&#x27;s last completed feature film was &quot;7 Women&quot; (MGM, 1966), a drama set in about 1935, about missionary women in China trying to protect themselves from the advances of a barbaric Mongolian warlord. Anne Bancroft took over the lead role from Patricia Neal, who suffered a near-fatal stroke two days into shooting. The supporting cast included Margaret Leighton, Flora Robson, Sue Lyon, Mildred Dunnock, Anna Lee, Eddie Albert, Mike Mazurki and Woody Strode, with music by Elmer Bernstein. Unfortunately, it was a commercial flop, grossing only about half of its $2.3 million budget. Unusual for Ford, it was shot in continuity for the sake of the performances and he, therefore, exposed about four times as much film as he usually shot. Anna Lee recalled that Ford was &quot;absolutely charming&quot; to everyone and that the only major blow-up came when Flora Robson complained that the sign on her dressing room door did not include her title (&quot;Dame&quot;) and as a result, Robson was &quot;absolutely shredded&quot; by Ford in front of the cast and crew.

Ford&#x27;s next project, &quot;The Miracle of Merriford&quot;, was scrapped by MGM less than a week before shooting was to have begun. His last completed work was &quot;Chesty: A Tribute to a Legend&quot;, a documentary on the most decorated U.S. Marine, General Lewis B. Puller, with narration by John Wayne, which was made in 1970 but not released until 1976, three years after Ford&#x27;s death.

Ford&#x27;s health deteriorated rapidly in the early 1970s; he suffered a broken hip in 1970 which put him in a wheelchair. He had to move from his Bel Air home to a single-level house in Palm Desert, California, near Eisenhower Medical Center, where he was being treated for stomach cancer. The Screen Directors Guild staged a tribute to Ford in October 1972, and in March 1973 the American Film Institute honored him with its first Lifetime Achievement Award at a ceremony which was telecast nationwide, with President Richard Nixon promoting Ford to full Admiral and presenting him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

According to Ford&#x27;s longtime partner and friend, John Wayne, Ford could have continued to direct movies. He told Roger Ebert in 1976: Up until the very last years of his life ... Pappy could have directed another picture, and a damned good one. But they said Pappy was too old. Hell, he was never too old. In Hollywood these days, they don&#x27;t stand behind a fella. They&#x27;d rather make a goddamned legend out of him and be done with him.Ford died on August 31, 1973, at Palm Desert and his funeral was held on September 5 at Hollywood&#x27;s Church of the Blessed Sacrament. He was interred in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

==Personality and directing style==

===Personality===
Ford was renowned for his distinct and forceful personality, and his many idiosyncrasies and eccentricities. From the early Thirties onwards, he always wore dark glasses and a patch over his left eye, which was only partly to protect his poor eyesight. He was an inveterate pipe-smoker and while he was shooting he would chew on a linen handkerchief—each morning his wife would give him a dozen fresh handkerchiefs, but by the end of a day&#x27;s filming the corners of all of them would be chewed to shreds. He always had music played on the set and would routinely break for tea (Earl Grey) at mid-afternoon every day during filming. He discouraged chatter and disliked swearing on set; its use, especially in front of a woman, would typically result in the offender being thrown off the production. He rarely drank during the making of a film, but when a production wrapped he would often lock himself in his study, wrapped only in a sheet, and go on a solitary drinking binge for several days, followed by routine contrition and a vow never to drink again. He was extremely sensitive to criticism and was always particularly angered by any comparison between his work and that of his elder brother Francis. He rarely attended premieres or award ceremonies, although his Oscars and other awards were proudly displayed on the mantel in his home.

There were occasional rumors about his sexual preferences, and in her 2004 autobiography &quot; &#x27;Tis Herself&quot;, Maureen O&#x27;Hara recalled seeing Ford kissing a famous male actor (whom she did not name) in his office at Columbia Studios.

He was untidy, and his study was always littered with books, papers, and clothes. He bought a brand new Rolls-Royce in the 1930s, but never rode in it because his wife, Mary, would not let him smoke in it. His own car, a battered Ford roadster, was so dilapidated and messy that he was once late for a studio meeting because the guard at the studio gate did not believe that the real John Ford would drive such a car, and refused to let him in.

Ford held antipathy towards studio executives. On one early film for Fox he is said to have ordered a guard to keep studio boss Darryl F. Zanuck off the set, and on another occasion, he brought an executive in front of the crew, stood him in profile and announced, &quot;This is an associate producer—take a good look, because you won&#x27;t be seeing him on this picture again&quot;. While shooting &quot;Rio Grande&quot; in 1950, producer Herbert Yates and Republic executive Rudy Ralston visited the location and when Yates pointed out the time (it was 10am) and asked when Ford intended to start shooting, Ford barked: &quot;Just as soon as you get the hell off my set!&quot; At dinner, Ford reportedly recruited cast member Alberto Morin to masquerade as an inept French waiter, who proceeded to spill soup over them, break plates and cause general mayhem, but the two executives apparently didn&#x27;t realize they were the victims of one of Ford&#x27;s practical jokes.

He greatly enjoyed spending time on his yacht, &quot;Araner&quot;, which he bought in 1934 and on which he lavished hundreds of thousands of dollars in repairs and improvements over the years; it became his chief retreat between films and a meeting place for his circle of close friends, including John Wayne and Ward Bond.

Ford was highly intelligent, erudite, sensitive and sentimental, but to protect himself in the cutthroat atmosphere of Hollywood he cultivated the image of a &quot;tough, two-fisted, hard-drinking Irish sonofabitch&quot;. One famous event, witnessed by Ford&#x27;s friend, actor Frank Baker, strikingly illustrates the tension between the public persona and the private man. During the Depression, Ford—by then a very wealthy man—was accosted outside his office by a former Universal actor who was destitute and needed $200 for an operation for his wife. As the man related his misfortunes, Ford appeared to become enraged and then, to the horror of onlookers, he launched himself at the man, knocked him to the floor and shouted &quot;How dare you come here like this? Who do think you are to talk to me this way?&quot; before storming out of the room. However, as the shaken old man left the building, Frank Baker saw Ford&#x27;s business manager Fred Totman meet him at the door, where he handed the man a cheque for $1,000 and instructed Ford&#x27;s chauffeur to drive him home. There, an ambulance was waiting to take the man&#x27;s wife to the hospital where a specialist, flown in from San Francisco at Ford&#x27;s expense, performed the operation. Sometime later, Ford purchased a house for the couple and pensioned them for life. When Baker related the story to Francis Ford, he declared that the incident illustrated his brother&#x27;s personality very well:

Any moment, if that old actor had kept talking, people would have realized what a softy Jack is. He couldn&#x27;t have stood through that sad story without breaking down. He&#x27;s built this whole legend of toughness around himself to protect his softness.

In the book &quot;Wayne and Ford, The Films, the Friendship, and the Forging of an American Hero&quot; by Nancy Schoenberger, the author dissects the cultural impact of the masculinity portrayed in Ford&#x27;s films. In an interview with &quot;Portland Magazine&quot;, Schoenberger states, &quot;Regarding Ford and Wayne &quot;tweaking the conventions of what a &#x27;man&#x27; is today,&quot; I think Ford, having grown up with brothers he idolized, in a rough-and-tumble world of boxers, drinkers, and roustabouts, found his deepest theme in male camaraderie, especially in the military, one of the few places where men can express their love for other men. But he was concerned with men acting heroically, thus the most macho guy was not always the most heroic. McLaglen often presented the comic side of blustery masculinity. Ford brought out Wayne&#x27;s tenderness as well as his toughness, especially in &quot;Stagecoach&quot;.&quot;

===General style===
Ford had many distinctive stylistic trademarks and a suite of thematic preoccupations and visual and aural motifs recurs throughout his work as a director. Film journalist Ephraim Katz summarized some of the keynote features of Ford&#x27;s work in his Collins &quot;Film Encyclopedia&quot; entry:

In contrast to his contemporary Alfred Hitchcock, Ford never used storyboards, composing his pictures entirely in his head, without any written or graphic outline of the shots he would use. Script development could be intense but, once approved, his screenplays were rarely rewritten; he was also one of the first filmmakers to encourage his writers and actors to prepare a full back story for their characters. He hated long expository scenes and was famous for tearing pages out of a script to cut dialogue. During the making of &quot;Mogambo&quot;, when challenged by the film&#x27;s producer Sam Zimbalist about falling three days behind schedule, Ford responded by tearing three pages out of the script and declaring &quot;We&#x27;re on schedule&quot; and indeed he never filmed those pages. While making &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot;, Ford neatly sidestepped the challenge of shooting a large and expensive battle scene—he had Henry Fonda improvise a monologue while firing questions from behind the camera about the course of the battle (a subject on which Fonda was well-versed) and then simply editing out the questions.

He was relatively sparing in his use of camera movements and close-ups, preferring static medium or long shots, with his players framed against dramatic vistas or interiors lit in an Expressionistic style, although he often used panning shots and sometimes used a dramatic dolly in (e.g. John Wayne&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Stagecoach&quot;). Ford is famous for his exciting tracking shots, such as the Apache chase sequence in &quot;Stagecoach&quot; or the attack on the Comanche camp in &quot;The Searchers&quot;.

Recurring visual motifs include trains and wagons—many Ford films begin and end with a linking vehicle such as a train or wagon arriving and leaving—doorways, roads, flowers, rivers, gatherings (parades, dances, meetings, bar scenes, etc.); he also employed gestural motifs in many films, notably the throwing of objects and the lighting of lamps, matches or cigarettes. If a doomed character was shown playing poker (such as Liberty Valance or gunman Tom Tyler in &quot;Stagecoach&quot;), the last hand he plays is the &quot;death hand&quot;—two eights and two aces, one of them the ace of spades—so-called because Wild Bill Hickok is said to have held this hand when he was murdered. Many of his sound films include renditions or quotations of his favorite hymn, &quot;Shall We Gather at the River?&quot;, such as its parodic use to underscore the opening scenes of &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, when the prostitute Dallas is being run out of town by local matrons. Character names also recur in many Ford films—the name Quincannon, for example, is used in several films including &quot;The Lost Patrol&quot;, &quot;Rio Grande&quot;, &quot;She Wore A Yellow Ribbon&quot; and &quot;Fort Apache&quot;, John Wayne&#x27;s character is named &quot;Kirby Yorke&quot; in both &quot;Fort Apache&quot; and &quot;Rio Grande&quot;, and the names Tyree and Boone are also recur in several Ford films.

Recent works about Ford&#x27;s depictions of Native Americans have argued that contrary to popular belief, his Indian characters spanned a range of hostile to sympathetic images from &quot;The Iron Horse&quot; to &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot;. His depiction of the Navajo in &quot;Wagon Master&quot; included their characters speaking the Navajo language. The distinguishing mark of Ford&#x27;s Indian-themed Westerns is that his Native characters always remained separate and apart from white society.

Ford was legendary for his discipline and efficiency on-set and was notorious for being extremely tough on his actors, frequently mocking, yelling and bullying them; he was also infamous for his sometimes sadistic practical jokes. Any actor foolish enough to demand star treatment would receive the full force of his relentless scorn and sarcasm. He once referred to John Wayne as a &quot;big idiot&quot; and even punched Henry Fonda. Henry Brandon (who played Chief Scar from &quot;The Searchers&quot;) once referred to Ford as &quot;the only man who could make John Wayne cry&quot;. . He likewise belittled Victor McLaglen, on one occasion reportedly bellowing through the megaphone: &quot;D&#x27;ya know, McLaglen, that Fox are paying you $1200 a week to do things that I could get any child off the street to do better?&quot;. Stock Company veteran Ward Bond was reportedly one of the few actors who were impervious to Ford&#x27;s taunting and sarcasms. Sir Donald Sinden, then a contract star for the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios when he starred in &quot;Mogambo&quot;, was not the only person to suffer at the hands of John Ford&#x27;s notorious behaviour. He recalls &quot;Ten White Hunters were seconded to our unit for our protection and to provide fresh meat. Among them was Marcus, Lord Wallscourt, a delightful man whom Ford treated abysmally—sometimes very sadistically. In Ford&#x27;s eyes the poor man could do nothing right and was continually being bawled out in front of the entire unit (in some ways he occasionally took the heat off me). None of us could understand the reason for this appalling treatment, which the dear kind man in no way deserved. He himself was quite at a loss. Several weeks later we discovered the cause from Ford&#x27;s brother-in-law: before emigrating to America, Ford&#x27;s grandfather had been a labourer on the estate in Ireland of the then Lord Wallscourt: Ford was now getting his own back at his descendant. Not a charming sight.&quot; &quot;We now had to return to the MGM-British Studios in London to shoot all the interior scenes. Someone must have pointed out to Ford that he had been thoroughly foul to me during the entire location shoot and when I arrived for my first day&#x27;s work, I found that he had caused a large notice to be painted at the entrance to our sound stage in capital letters reading BE KIND TO DONALD WEEK. He was as good as his word—for precisely seven days. On the eighth day he ripped the sign down and returned to his normal bullying behaviour.&quot;

Ford usually gave his actors little explicit direction, although on occasion he would casually walk through a scene himself, and actors were expected to note every subtle action or mannerism; if they did not, Ford would make them repeat the scene until they got it right, and he would often berate and belittle those who failed to achieve his desired performance. On &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot;, Ford ran through a scene with Edmond O&#x27;Brien and ended by drooping his hand over a railing. O&#x27;Brien noticed this but deliberately ignored it, placing his hand &quot;on&quot; the railing instead; Ford would not explicitly correct him and he reportedly made O&#x27;Brien play the scene forty-two times before the actor relented and did it Ford&#x27;s way.

Despite his often difficult and demanding personality, many actors who worked with Ford acknowledged that he brought out the best in them. John Wayne remarked that &quot;Nobody could handle actors and crew like Jack.&quot; Dobe Carey stated that &quot;He had a quality that made everyone almost kill themselves to please him. Upon arriving on the set, you would feel right away that something special was going to happen. You would feel spiritually awakened all of a sudden.&quot; Carey credits Ford with the inspiration of Carey&#x27;s final film, &quot;Comanche Stallion&quot; (2005).

Ford&#x27;s favorite location for his Western films was southern Utah&#x27;s Monument Valley. Although not generally appropriate geographically as a setting for his plots, the expressive visual impact of the area enabled Ford to define images of the American West with some of the most beautiful and powerful cinematography ever shot, in such films as &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, &quot;The Searchers&quot;, and &quot;Fort Apache&quot;. A notable example is the famous scene in &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; in which the cavalry troop is photographed against an oncoming storm. The influence on the films of classic Western artists such as Frederic Remington and others has been examined. Ford&#x27;s evocative use of the territory for his Westerns has defined the images of the American West so powerfully that Orson Welles once said that other film-makers refused to shoot in the region out of fears of plagiarism.

Ford typically shot only the footage he needed and often filmed in sequence, minimizing the job of his film editors. In the opinion of Joseph McBride, Ford&#x27;s technique of cutting in the camera enabled him to retain creative control in a period where directors often had little say on the final editing of their films. Ford noted:

I don&#x27;t give &#x27;em a lot of film to play with. In fact, Eastman used to complain that I exposed so little film. I do cut in the camera. Otherwise, if you give them a lot of film &#x27;the committee&#x27; takes over. They start juggling scenes around and taking out this and putting in that. They can&#x27;t do it with my pictures. I cut in the camera and that&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s not a lot of film left on the floor when I&#x27;m finished.

Ford hated the zoom lens and as a rule wouldn&#x27;t allow them on his sets nor camera cranes. However, his last film, &quot;&quot;, features a zoom shot.

==Awards and honors==
Ford won a total of four Academy Awards with all of them being for Best Director, for the films &quot;The Informer&quot; (1935), &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940), &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1941), and &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952)—none of them Westerns (also starring in the last two was Maureen O&#x27;Hara, &quot;his favorite actress&quot;). He was also nominated as Best Director for &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939). He later directed two documentaries, &quot;The Battle of Midway&quot; and &quot;December 7&quot;, which both won Best Documentary, although the award was not won by him. To this day Ford holds the record for winning the most Best Director Oscars, having won the award on four occasions. William Wyler and Frank Capra come in second having won the award three times. Ford was the first director to win consecutive Best Director awards, in 1940 and 1941. This feat was later matched by Joseph L. Mankiewicz exactly ten years later, when he won consecutive awards for Best Director in 1950 and 1951. As a producer, he also received a nomination for Best Picture for &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;. In 1955 and 1957, Ford was awarded the George Eastman Award given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film. He was the first recipient of the American Film Institute Life Achievement Award in 1973. Also in that year, Ford was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon.

Ford directed 10 different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Victor McLaglen, Thomas Mitchell, Edna May Oliver, Jane Darwell, Henry Fonda, Donald Crisp, Sara Allgood, Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly and Jack Lemmon. McLaglen, Mitchell, Darwell, Crisp and Lemmon won an Oscar for one of their roles in one of Ford&#x27;s movies.

In 1998, a statue of Ford was unveiled in Portland, Maine, across the street from where his father once owned a pub. Sculpted by artist George Kelly, the statue is surrounded by a memorial containing facts about Ford&#x27;s life and his films.

A television special featuring Ford, John Wayne, James Stewart, and Henry Fonda was broadcast over the CBS network on December 5, 1971, called &quot;The American West of John Ford&quot;, featuring clips from Ford&#x27;s career interspersed with interviews conducted by Wayne, Stewart, and Fonda, who also took turns narrating the hour-long documentary.

In 2007, Twentieth Century Fox released &quot;Ford at Fox&quot;, a DVD boxed set of 24 of Ford&#x27;s films. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Corliss named it one of the &quot;Top 10 DVDs of 2007&quot;, ranking it at No. 1.

In 2019 Jean-Christophe Klotz released the documentary film &quot;John Ford, l&#x27;homme qui inventa l&#x27;Amérique&quot; (&quot;the man who invented America&quot;), about his influence in the legend of the American West in films like &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939), &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940), &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; (1962) and &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot; (1964).

==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive has preserved a number of John Ford&#x27;s films, including &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;, &quot;The Battle of Midway&quot;, &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot;, &quot;Sex Hygiene&quot;, &quot;Torpedo Squadron 8&quot;, and &quot;Four Sons&quot;.

As of 2024, eleven films directed or co-directed by Ford have been added to the National Film Registry, tying with Howard Hawks for the most.

==Politics==
Early in life, Ford&#x27;s politics were conventionally progressive; his favorite presidents were Democrats Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Republican Abraham Lincoln. But despite these leanings, many thought he was a Republican because of his long association with actors John Wayne, James Stewart, Maureen O&#x27;Hara, and Ward Bond.

Ford&#x27;s attitude to McCarthyism in Hollywood is expressed by a story told by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. A faction of the Directors Guild of America, led by Cecil B. DeMille, had tried to make it mandatory for every member to sign a loyalty oath. A whispering campaign was being conducted against Mankiewicz, then President of the Guild, alleging he had Communist sympathies. At a crucial meeting of the Guild, DeMille&#x27;s faction spoke for four hours until Ford spoke against DeMille and proposed a vote of confidence in Mankiewicz, which was passed. His words were recorded by a stenographer:
Mankiewicz&#x27;s version of events was contested in 2016, with the discovery of the court transcript, which was released as part of the Mankiewicz archives. Mankiewicz&#x27;s account gives sole credit to Ford in sinking DeMille. The account has several embellishments. DeMille&#x27;s move to fire Mankiewicz had caused a storm of protest. DeMille was basically on the receiving end of a torrent of attacks from many speakers throughout the meeting and at one point looked like being solely thrown off the guild board.

At this point, Ford rose to speak. His opening was that he rose in defense of the board. He claimed a personal role in a vote of confidence for Joseph Mankiewicz. He then called for an end to politics in the Guild and for it to refocus on working conditions. Ford told the meeting that the guild was formed to &quot;protect ourselves against producers.&quot; Ford argued against &quot;putting out derogatory information about a director, whether he is a Communist, beats his mother-in-law, or beats dogs.&quot; Ford wanted the debate and the meeting to end as his focus was the unity of the guild. He said that Mankiewicz had been vilified and deserved an apology. His final section was to support DeMille against further calls for his resignation. Ford&#x27;s words about DeMille were, &quot;And I think that some of the accusations made here tonight were pretty UnAmerican. I mean a group of men have picked on probably the dean of our profession. I don&#x27;t agree with C. B. DeMille. I admire him. I don&#x27;t like him, but I admire him. Everything he said tonight he had a right to say. I don&#x27;t like to hear accusations against him.&quot; He concluded by &quot;pleading&quot; with the membership to retain DeMille.

Ford feared that DeMille&#x27;s exit might have caused the body to disintegrate. His second move was to have the entire board resign, which saved face for DeMille and allowed the issue to be settled without forced resignations. The next day, Ford wrote a letter supporting DeMille and then telephoned, where Ford described DeMille as &quot;a magnificent figure&quot; so far above that &quot;goddamn pack of rats.&quot;

At a heated and arduous meeting, Ford went to the defense of a colleague under sustained attack from his peers. He saw the dangers of expelling DeMille. Ford stared down the entire meeting to ensure that DeMille remained in the guild. He then later offered his own resignation—as part of the entire board—to ensure that the guild did not break and allowed DeMille to go without losing face.

As time went on, however, Ford became more publicly allied with the Republican Party, declaring himself a &quot;Maine Republican&quot; in 1947. He said he voted for Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election and supported Richard Nixon in 1968 and became a supporter of the Vietnam War. In 1973, he was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Nixon, whose campaign he had publicly supported.

In 1952, Ford hoped for a Robert Taft/Douglas MacArthur Republican presidential ticket. When Dwight Eisenhower won the nomination, Ford wrote to Taft saying that like &quot;a million other Americans, I am naturally bewildered and hurt by the outcome of the Republican Convention in Chicago.&quot;

In 1966, he supported Ronald Reagan in his governor&#x27;s race and again for his reelection in 1970.

Ford scholar Tag Gallagher asserts that Ford was &quot;essentially apolitical&quot;, although he also notes that the director became an ardent supporter of the Irish Republican Army after his first visit to Ireland in the 1920s, and that he channelled funds to the IRA for the rest of his career.

==Influence==
Ford is widely considered to be among the most influential of Hollywood&#x27;s filmmakers. He was listed as the sixth most influential director of all time by Flickside. Below are some of the people who were directly influenced by Ford, or greatly admired his work:
* Georgy Avenarius – the film critic was a Soviet major in charge of UFA GmbH Babelsberg Studio in Soviet Berlin. He allowed Budd Schulberg and the men of the OSS Field Photographic Branch access to Nazi newsreels and propaganda upon learning that they worked for Ford.
* Ingmar Bergman – Said of Ford, &quot;the best director in the world&quot;.
* Bahram Beyzai wrote a laudatory critical review of Ford&#x27;s more famous films in 1961, which is anthologized in Massoud Farasati&#x27;s 2014 collection of writings by and about Ford in Persian
* Peter Bogdanovich – &quot;Directed by John Ford&quot; (1971)
* Frank Capra – Referred to Ford as the &quot;king of directors&quot;
* Michael Cimino
* Federico Fellini
* Jean-Luc Godard – Once compared the ending of &quot;The Searchers&quot; to &quot;Ulysses being reunited with Telemachus&quot;
* Howard Hawks
* Alfred Hitchcock – &quot;A John Ford film was a visual gratification&quot;
* Elia Kazan
* Satoshi Kon took inspiration from Ford&#x27;s &quot;3 Godfathers&quot; for his animated film &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot;, a riff on Ford&#x27;s western, set in contemporary Tokyo.
* Stanley Kubrick
* Akira Kurosawa – &quot;I have respected John Ford from the beginning. Needless to say, I pay close attention to his productions, and I think I am influenced by them.&quot;
* David Lean took inspiration from &quot;The Searchers&quot; for his film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;
* Sergio Leone
* George Lucas
* Sam Peckinpah
* Satyajit Ray – &quot;A hallmark is never easy to describe, but the nearest description of Ford&#x27;s would be a combination of strength and simplicity. The nearest equivalent I can think of is a musical one: middle-period Beethoven.&quot;
* Jean Renoir – After seeing &quot;The Informer&quot;, he reportedly told George Seaton: &quot;I learned so much today ... I learned how to not move my camera.&quot;
* Martin Scorsese
* Steven Spielberg – Once encountered Ford on a studio lot in the 1960s, an event he dramatized in the 2022 film &quot;The Fabelmans&quot;, with David Lynch as Ford and Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy Fabelman, a character loosely based on Spielberg who meets Ford during the final scene.
* Jean-Marie Straub praised Ford as &quot;the most Brechtian of all filmmakers&quot;
* Bertrand Tavernier
* Andrei Tarkovsky cited Ford as one of his favorite film directors in an interview with critic Kazuo Yamada.
* François Truffaut
* John Wayne
* Orson Welles – When asked to name the directors who most appealed to him, he replied: &quot;I like the old masters, by which I mean John Ford, John Ford and John Ford.&quot;
* Wim Wenders
* Pedro Costa – &quot;It makes me dream and it makes me come back. I felt so right when I saw a film by John Ford and I was in front of those people. It was a dream thing. It was a real thing.&quot;

==John Ford Ireland==

In December 2011 the Irish Film &amp; Television Academy (IFTA), in association with the John Ford Estate and the Irish Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, established &quot;John Ford Ireland&quot;, celebrating the work and legacy of John Ford. The Irish Academy stated that through John Ford Ireland, they hope to lay the foundations for honoring, examining and learning from the work and legacy of John Ford, who is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers of his generation.

===Symposium===
The first John Ford Ireland Symposium was held in Dublin, Ireland from June 7 to 10, 2012. The Symposium, designed to draw inspiration from and celebrate Ford&#x27;s ongoing influence on contemporary cinema, featured a diverse program of events, including a series of screenings, masterclasses, panel discussions, public interviews, and an outdoor screening of &quot;The Searchers&quot;.

Guests who attended included Dan Ford, grandson of John Ford; composer Christopher Caliendo conducted the acclaimed RTÉ Concert Orchestra performing his score to Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Iron Horse&quot;, opening the four-day event; author and biographer Joseph McBride gave the Symposium&#x27;s opening lecture; directors Peter Bogdanovich, Stephen Frears, John Boorman, Jim Sheridan, Brian Kirk, Thaddeus O&#x27;Sullivan and Sé Merry Doyle participated in a number of events; Irish writers Patrick McCabe, Colin Bateman, Ian Power and Eoghan Harris examined Ford&#x27;s work from a screenwriters perspective; Joel Cox delivered an editing masterclass; and composers and musicians, among whom David Holmes and Kyle Eastwood, discussed music for film.

The John Ford Ireland Film Symposium was held again in Dublin in Summer 2013.

===John Ford Award===
Clint Eastwood received the inaugural John Ford Award in December 2011. It was presented at a reception in Burbank, California, by Michael Collins, Irish Ambassador to the United States, Dan Ford, grandson of John Ford, and Áine Moriarty, Chief Executive of the Irish Film &amp; Television Academy (IFTA).

Accepting the Award, Eastwood said: &quot;Any kind of association with John Ford is most directors&#x27; dream, as he was certainly a pioneer of American filmmaking and I grew up on his films. His Westerns had a great influence on me, as I think they had on everybody. When I worked with Sergio Leone years ago in Italy, his favorite Director was John Ford and he spoke very openly about that influence. I want to thank everybody who is here from the Irish Academy, the John Ford family and thank you to John Ford Ireland.&quot;

<text>John Milo &quot;Mike&quot; Ford (April 10, 1957 – September 25, 2006) was an American science fiction and fantasy writer, game designer, and poet.

A contributor to several online discussions, Ford composed poems, often improvised, in both complicated forms and blank verse; he also wrote pastiches and parodies of many other authors and styles. At Minicon and other science fiction conventions he would perform &quot;Ask Dr. Mike&quot;, giving humorous answers to scientific and other questions in a lab coat before a whiteboard.

==Life==
Ford was born in East Chicago, Indiana, and raised in Whiting, Indiana. In the mid-1970s he attended Indiana University Bloomington, where he was active in the IU science fiction club and Society for Creative Anachronism (using the name Miles Atherton de Grey); while there, he published his first short story &quot;This, Too, We Reconcile&quot; in the May 1976 &quot;Analog&quot;.

Ford left IU and moved to New York to work on the newly founded &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot;, where, starting in mid-1978, he published poetry, fiction, articles, and game reviews. Although his last non-fiction appeared there in September 1981, he was tenth most frequent contributor for the 1977–2002 period. About 1990, he moved to Minneapolis. In addition to writing, he worked at various times as a hospital orderly, computer consultant, slush pile reader, and copy editor.

Ford suffered from complications related to diabetes since childhood and also had renal dysfunction which required dialysis and, in 2000, a kidney transplant, which improved his quality of life considerably. He was found dead from natural causes in his Minneapolis home on September 25, 2006, by his partner since the mid-1990s, Elise Matthesen. He was a prominent member of the &quot;Friends of the Minneapolis Public Library&quot;, which established a &quot;John M. Ford Book Endowment&quot; after his death with the donations to be used as interest-generating capital for yearly purchase of new books.

==Work==
Ford&#x27;s works were varied in setting and style. Several were of the Bildungsroman (coming-of-age) type: in &quot;Web of Angels&quot;, &quot;The Final Reflection&quot;, &quot;Princes of the Air&quot;, &quot;Growing Up Weightless&quot;, and &quot;The Last Hot Time&quot;, Ford wrote variations on the theme of growing up, learning about one&#x27;s world and one&#x27;s place in it, and taking responsibility for it – which involves taking on the power and wisdom to influence events, to help make the world a better place.

Ford spent part of his career working in other people&#x27;s universes. His 1983 book &quot;The Klingons&quot; for FASA&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek: The Role Playing Game&quot; had an influence on subsequent productions from Paramount. He also wrote a comedic novel set in the Star Trek universe called &quot;How Much for Just the Planet?&quot;, where the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew compete with a Klingon crew for control of a planet whose unhappy colonists defend their peace in inventive and farcial ways. The book includes song lyrics that satirize many 20th century stage musicals.

Ford authored the award-winning adventure &quot;The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues&quot; (1985) for West End Games&#x27; &quot;Paranoia&quot; role-playing game.

Ford used a variety of styles to suit the world, characters, and situations he chose to write about. Author and critic John Clute wrote in the 1993 &quot;Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; that &quot;two decades into his career, there remains some sense that JMF remains unwilling or unable to create a definitive style or mode; but his originality is evident, a shifting feisty energy informs almost everything he writes, and that career is still young.&quot;

Ford was much respected by his fellow writers, editors, critics and fans. Robert Jordan, Ford&#x27;s lifelong close friend, called Ford &quot;the best writer in America – bar none.&quot; Neil Gaiman called Ford &quot;my best critic... the best writer I knew.&quot; Patrick Nielsen Hayden said, &quot;Most normal people had the slight sense that something large and super-intelligent and trans-human had sort of flown over... There would be a point where basically the plot would become so knotted and complex he would lose all of us.&quot;

After his death, almost all of Ford&#x27;s work was out of print. The rights to his work had reverted to his legal heirs, but no one had managed to get in touch with them. After an investigation by a journalist, Isaac Butler, Ford&#x27;s editors at Tor Books were able to reconnect with his family, and in November 2019 an agreement was reached to reissue all his published works, starting in 2020 with &quot;The Dragon Waiting.&quot;

<text>Tage Fritjof Erlander (; 13 June 1901 – 21 June 1985) was a Swedish politician and statesman who served as the prime minister of Sweden and leader of the Social Democratic Party from 1946 to 1969. Previously, he served as minister of education from 1945 to 1946, and was a member of the Riksdag from 1932 to 1973. During his premiership, Sweden developed into one of the world&#x27;s most advanced welfare states, with the &quot;Swedish Model&quot; at the peak of its acclaim and notoriety. His uninterrupted tenure of 23 years as head of the government is the longest ever in Sweden and in any modern Western democracy.

Born to a poor family in Ransäter, Erlander later studied at Lund University. He was elected to Lund&#x27;s municipal council in 1930, and in 1932 he was elected as a member of the Riksdag. Becoming a member of the World War II coalition government in 1944, Erlander rose unexpectedly to the leadership upon the death of Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson in October 1946, maintaining the position of the Social Democrats as the dominant party in the country. Known for his moderation, pragmatism and self-irony, Erlander often sought approval from the liberal-conservative opposition for his policies, &quot;de facto&quot; dropping all pretences of wide-scale nationalizations whilst introducing reforms such as universal health insurance, pension additions and a growing public sector, although stopping short of raising tax levels above the average OECD levels at the time. Until the 1960s, income taxes were lower in Sweden than in the United States.

For most of his time in power, Erlander ran a minority government of the Social Democrats. From 1951 to 1957, he instead ran a coalition with the Farmers&#x27; League. The Social Democrats held a majority of seats in the upper house for most of this time and this allowed Erlander to remain in power after the 1956 general election, when the right-wing parties won a majority. A snap election in 1958 then reversed this result.

In foreign policy, he initially sought an alliance of Nordic countries, but without success, instead maintaining strict neutrality while spending heavily on the military (but ultimately rejecting nuclear capability and signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 1968). Erlander&#x27;s mandate coincided with the post–World War II economic expansion, in Sweden known as the record years, in which Sweden saw its economy grow to one of the ten strongest in the world, and subsequently joined the G10.

In the 1968 general election, he won his seventh and most successful victory, with the Social Democrats winning an absolute majority of the popular vote and seats in the lower chamber. Erlander resigned the following year during a process of major constitutional reform, and was succeeded by his long-time protégé and friend Olof Palme. He continued to serve as a member of the Riksdag until he resigned in 1973. Afterwards, Erlander continued to speak on political matters and published his memoirs. He died in 1985. He was considered one of the most popular leaders in the world by the end of the 1960s, and one of the most popular prime ministers in the history of Sweden.

==Early life and education==
Tage Fritjof Erlander was born in Ransäter, Värmland County on June 13, 1901, on the top floor of the house today known as . His parents were Alma Erlander (née Nilsson) and Erik Gustaf Erlander. Erik Gustaf was a teacher and cantor who married Alma Nilsson in 1893. Erlander had an older brother, Janne Gustaf Erlander (born 1893), an older sister, Anna Erlander (born 1894), and a younger sister, Dagmar Erlander (born 1904). Erlander&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Anders Erlandsson, worked as a smith at an ironworks, and his maternal grandfather was a farmer who held a public office in his home municipality. On his maternal grandmother&#x27;s side, Erlander descended from Forest Finns, who migrated to Värmland from the Finnish province of Savonia in the 17th century.

According to Erlander, his father was very religious, supportive of universal suffrage, pro-free market, anti-trade union, and liberal. Erlander also said that his father became increasingly anti-socialist as he aged, speculating that his father was unhappy with his son&#x27;s eventual election to parliament as a member of a socialist party.

The Erlander family was initially poor, although Erik Gustaf was able to make money through selling homemade furniture and exporting lingonberries to Germany. As a child, Erlander lived on the second floor of Erlandergården, and attended school on the first floor. He later attended schools in Karlstad, living in a boarding house for children of clergymen. He was reportedly a good student in high school.

From 1921 to 1922, Erlander carried out his mandatory military service at a machine gun factory in Malmslätt. In September 1920, his father enrolled him at Lund University rather than Uppsala University, as he felt Lund was more affordable. As a student at Lund, Erlander was heavily involved in student politics and met many politically radical students. He was exposed to societal and economic injustices, and began to identify with socialism. Beginning in autumn of 1923, Erlander read the writings of Karl Marx. He met his future wife, fellow student Aina Andersson. They began working together in the chemistry department in 1923. He also met and studied natural sciences with fellow student and future physicist Torsten Gustafson, who would later serve as an advisor on nuclear affairs to Erlander during his premiership. In addition to his scientific studies, Erlander also read some economics, and was an active member of Wermlands Nation, where he was elected Kurator (head executive) in 1922. In 1926, he led student opposition to celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the Battle of Lund. He graduated with a degree in political science and economics in 1928.

From 1928 to 1929 he completed his compulsory military service in the Signal Corps and eventually went on to become a reserve Lieutenant. Erlander&#x27;s first major job was a member of the editorial staff of the encyclopedia &quot;Svensk upplagsbok&quot; from 1928 to 1938. In 1930 Tage and Aina married, although in his memoirs he stated that they both opposed the institution. They spent their first few years of marriage apart, as Erlander was working in Lund while Aina was working in Karlshamn, and they only saw each other on holidays. Their first son, Sven Bertil Erlander, was born on May 25, 1934, in Halmstad, and their second son, Bo Gunnar Erlander, was born in Lund on May 16, 1937.

==Early political career==
===MP and state secretary===
Erlander joined the Social Democratic Party in 1928, and was elected to the Lund municipal council in 1930. He was involved in improving poor city housing, lowering unemployment, and installing a new bathhouse. He served on the council until 1938.

He was elected as a member of the Riksdag (parliament) in 1932, representing Fyrstadskretsen, which he would represent until 1944. He began making political connections, and attracted the attention of prominent Social Democratic politician and Minister for Social Affairs Gustav Möller. In 1938, Möller appointed Erlander as a state secretary at the Ministry of Social Affairs. After Erlander became a state secretary, he and Aina, with their children, moved to Stockholm. In 1941, Sweden&#x27;s Population Commission was created under Erlander&#x27;s leadership. He served as its chairman, and it put forward proposals on grants and regulations of daycare centers and play schools.

As a state secretary, Erlander was one of the most senior officials responsible for the establishment of internment camps in Sweden during World War II. Various types of camps were set up, primarily to house and detain refugees and foreigners arriving to Sweden, to house interned German and Allied military personnel (e.g. pilots who had crashed in Sweden), and to replace the military draft for pro-Soviet Communists and others who were viewed as unreliable and hostile to Sweden&#x27;s political system; instead of being stationed in the armed forces, they were conscripted to work camps organized to build infrastructure. Writing in his memoirs in the 1970s, Erlander downplayed his knowledge of the camps, as, according to journalist Niclas Sennerteg, Erlander knew about their existence long before he claimed and was integral to their design and function.

In 1942, Erlander and Möller initiated a nationwide census of the Swedish Travelers, a branch of the Romani people.

===In Hansson&#x27;s government===

Erlander ascended to Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson&#x27;s World War II coalition cabinet in 1944 as a minister without portfolio, a post he held until the next year. Following the 1944 general election, he began representing the Malmöhus County.

In the summer of 1945, as part of Hansson&#x27;s post-war cabinet, he became minister of education and ecclesiastical affairs. It has been suggested that Erlander was chosen for the position due to his lack of experience with educational policies, as he was not associated with factional divides regarding debates over Sweden&#x27;s educational system. Erlander was initially skeptical about accepting the role, but he eventually grew accustomed to it, despite not holding the office very long.

Erlander largely left ecclesiastical matters to other politicians, instead focusing on tangible educational reforms. Influenced by his experiences at Lund University, he proposed larger investments in research and higher education. He was a major driving force behind successful laws providing free school lunches and textbooks. On October 29, 1945, Erlander was visited by Austro-Swedish nuclear physicist Lise Meitner, to discuss Sweden investing in nuclear physics and technology following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1946, Möller introduced a new pension proposal, a uniform one which would lift all pensioners above the poverty line, which Erlander and Minister for Finance Ernst Wigforss opposed, but it passed in the Riksdag.

At the 1945 Social Democratic party conference, Per Nyström presented a motion to update Swedish schooling. The conference was split on how much schooling should be mandatory, with some arguing it should only extend to elementary school. Despite the disagreements, the conference requested the party executive create a special committee to develop school programs. The committee was divided on whether students should be separated by abilities, a practice known as streaming. It never reached a consensus, but finished a draft for a new school program requiring nine years of universal mandatory education, although it was never submitted to the party. In 1946, Erlander, as minister of education, created a second committee, the Schools Commission, despite the first one being still active. This new committee, chaired by Erlander, was composed mainly of appointed party members. By 1948, after Erlander had become prime minister, the second committee also proposed nine years of mandatory schooling, but the question of when to begin streaming was still debated.

===Succeeding Hansson===
Prime Minister Hansson suddenly died on October 6, 1946. Foreign Minister Östen Undén was chosen to serve as interim prime minister until a successor could be chosen. Erlander and his wife were in Lund when Hansson died, and when they returned to the Grand Hôtel, they were informed of his death by Minister of Defense Allan Vougt.

On October 6, Hansson&#x27;s cabinet and the Social Democrat executive committee met, and the executive committee scheduled a full board party meeting for October 9, as did the Social Democratic party caucus. Erlander first learned of his possible selection as prime minister and party leader on October 7. Erlander himself was reluctant and had little interest in becoming prime minister, saying he would only do so if the desire from the party was strong enough.

At the October 9 meeting, the board voted 15 to 11 in favor of Erlander becoming prime minister, and the caucus voted 94 to 72 to make Erlander party leader. The choice was considered surprising and controversial, and some believed Gustav Möller, who received the 72 remaining votes, was Hansson&#x27;s obvious successor, including Möller himself. The choice of Erlander has been attributed to younger party members wanting a younger generation to lead and Erlander being viewed as a greater figure of change, as he was experienced in areas seen as important to Social Democrats such as social and educational policies, and was able to foster cooperation between people with differing views.

==Premiership and party leadership==
===First government: 1946–1951===
====Ascension and first actions====
After Erlander was chosen as prime minister, Hansson&#x27;s cabinet all submitted their resignations, as was routine. King Gustaf V met Erlander on October 13, asking him to form a new government. Erlander asked all cabinet members to withdraw their resignations.

Upon meeting Erlander at Drottningholm and asking him to form a new government, Gustaf encouragingly told Erlander that times were difficult, and that a younger man serving as prime minister was best for Sweden. He also assured Erlander that &quot;things would work out well&quot;, and that the two of them would get along as initially he had some disagreements with Per Albin Hansson, who was ideologically a republican.

In the two years leading up to the 1948 election, Erlander visited numerous Social Democratic organizations across the country to solidify his support and explain party policies. Within his first 365 days in office, he made between seventy to eighty public appearances outside of Stockholm. Social Democratic newspapers began writing positively about Erlander‘s speaking events. Nonsocialist newspapers became more critical of Erlander, first casting him as an irrelevant figure, then as an unreliable and uninspiring tactician. These perceived attacks made Erlander more popular within the party.

====First cabinet====

Erlander inherited 14 ministers from Hansson. Overall, Erlander allowed his cabinet ministers a great deal of freedom, as he did not want to become overly involved in coordinating them daily, but he did monitor them. Over his premiership, Hansson&#x27;s ministers slowly left the government. Minister of Commerce Gunnar Myrdal implemented policies such as selling the Soviet Union machinery on a fifteen-year credit and a 17% appreciation of the Swedish krona. The former, conceived by his predecessor, was viewed as less economically attractive due to stronger trading partners existing post-war, and the latter worsened Sweden&#x27;s trade deficit. Due to the backlash, he resigned in 1947, becoming the first minister to leave Erlander&#x27;s government.

Erlander appointed to replace him as minister of education and ecclesiastical affairs. In 1947, Karin Kock became the first woman in Swedish to hold a cabinet position when she became a minister without portfolio, and in 1948 she became minister of supply. Kock was suggested by Riksdag member Ulla Wohlin, who would serve in Erlander&#x27;s third cabinet as Sweden&#x27;s third female cabinet minister. Kock left the post in 1949, and the office was abolished the following year.

Weijne died in office in 1951, and Erlander appointed Hildur Nygren to succeed him, making her the second woman in Sweden to become a cabinet minister.

====Election of 1948====

Going into the 1948 election, Erlander&#x27;s first as party leader and prime minister, many Social Democrats expected their party to lose, including Erlander&#x27;s future protégé and later prime minister Ingvar Carlsson. The Liberal People&#x27;s Party was becoming a major opposition party their new leader, Bertil Ohlin. During the World War II coalition government, Ohlin had served as Hansson&#x27;s minister of commerce, but he opposed Hansson&#x27;s various social policy proposals During Erlander&#x27;s government he generally came to support many of the Social Democrats&#x27; policies. Despite this, Erlander, still partially influenced by Ohlin&#x27;s opposition to the Hansson government, harbored a strong dislike of the Liberals and their leader. In speeches and during Riksdag debates, Erlander frequently attacked the Liberals with accusations including irresponsibility, opportunism, and irreconcilability. Erlander viewed Ohlin as &quot;stiff, self-righteous, arrogant, bossy, and lacking in principles&quot;, while Ohiln wrote in his memoirs that Erlander was &quot;evasive, ungenerous, uncertain, quick to take offense, and a somewhat unfair debater.&quot; Their political rivalry is considered one of the most notable in modern Swedish history.

Despite fears, the Social Democrats won 46.13%. In the Andra kammaren (&quot;Second chamber&quot; or lower house) of the Riksdag, the Social Democrats secured 112 out of 230 total seats. The Liberals came in second with 22.8% of the vote, one of their largest victories. Erlander himself had now been elected as a representative of Stockholm County, following his four years a Malmöhus representative.

Following this election, the Social Democrats remained in power, but desired to maintain a long-term majority, so they offered to form a coalition government with the Centre Party. They declined, but this had no impact on Erlander&#x27;s ability to form a government on time, as the talks were public but informal.

===Coalition government: 1951–1957===

====Socialist–Centrist cabinet====
In 1951, Erlander formed a coalition with the Centre Party. He added four Centrists to his cabinet that year. His working relationship with the party&#x27;s leader, Gunnar Hedlund, is known to have been good. Erlander and Hedlund, while disagreeing on some issues, shared a common desire to outmaneuver the Liberals and the Moderate Party. The voter bases of both parties are also considered to have been similar. Under the coalition, Hedlund became minister for home affairs.

One of the positions that the Centrists demanded be given to one of their own was the minister of education, which had been held by Hildur Nygren since earlier that year. Erlander did not get along with Nygren, and used the negotiations as an excuse to remove her. The coalition government was formed on October 1, 1951.

====Election of 1952====

In the 1952 general election, the Social Democrats won 46%, a slight decrease from the previous election. The Centrists obtained 10.7%, which was also a decrease for them. The Liberals gained 24.4%, an increase from their previous percentage.

====Gustaf VI Adolf and Haijby scandal====

Erlander served under King Gustaf V for 4 years, and the two had a mutual respect. Gustaf, aged 88 upon Erlander&#x27;s ascension to the premiership, was not very politically active. In 1950, upon the death of his father, Crown Prince Gustaf VI Adolf became king. Erlander was also on good terms with Gustaf VI, but at times disapproved of the new king&#x27;s more hands-on involvement in political matters than his father, and during Gustaf VI&#x27;s time as Crown Prince, Erlander saw him as a &quot;rather stiff individual who lacked perspective&quot;.

In 1947, Kurt Haijby, who had previously been arrested multiple times on suspected homosexual acts, wrote a memoir about his experiences, which included previous claims that he had a sexual relationship with Gustaf V. The Stockholm police bought most of the stock to prevent distribution, and the government took charge of the affair. According to Erlander, Minister of the Interior Eije Mossberg opened a cabinet meeting by stating, &quot;The King is homosexual!&quot; to which Wigforss replied, &quot;At his age? How vigorous!&quot; One of the only copies that got out was read by Erlander. He reportedly believed the allegations. According to journalist , Erlander later told her of how he was tormented for decades by the &quot;Haijbyskiten&quot; ().

====Election of 1956====

In the 1956 general election, the party won 44.58%, a larger decrease than the previous one. Erlander at one point stated that the setback was due to, among other things, &quot;Christian anti-socialist agitation.&quot; Their coalition partners, the Centrists, garnered 9.45%.

====Pension referendum and coalition collapse====
Despite the ideological similarities between the Social Democrats and the Centrists, a major issue was Sweden&#x27;s proposed pension system. Erlander desired a system that was mandatory for all citizens, while Hedlund wanted the pensions to be voluntary. A referendum on the issue in 1957 included three proposals for pensions systems, one by the Social Democrats, another by the Centrists, and the third by the right. The Social Democrats&#x27; proposal won with 45.8% of the vote, while the right&#x27;s garnered 35.3% and the Centrists&#x27; 15%.

As a result of the pension referendum, the coalition dissolved that year. Following this, the king facilitated inter-party dialogue, specifically asking about the possibility of the Social Democrats forming a coalition with the three non-socialist parties. Erlander was appointed formateur/informateur, but was very reluctant to create a four-party government. The king then designated the Liberals and Moderates as formateurs, and asked them to explore creating a non-socialist government. The Centrists stated that they were unwilling to join the other two parties in a coalition, and the plans failed. Erlander was thus allowed to remain prime minister and formateur, leading a minority government into the next election.

===Final government: 1957–1969===
====Third cabinet and &quot;the boys&quot;====
Nine of the ten cabinet ministries Erlander inherited from Hansson&#x27;s cabinet existed by the end of Erlander&#x27;s premiership. Three additional ministries were created, with Erlander&#x27;s final cabinet having twelve ministries by 1968. Altogether, 57 people served in Erlander&#x27;s cabinets.

In August 1953, Erlander hired Olof Palme to serve as his personal secretary. In 1963, he ascended to the cabinet as a minister without portfolio. Palme became Minister of Communications in 1965, and in 1967 became Minister of Education. Beginning with Palme, Erlander began to hire a larger group of personal staff, including typists and stenographers, consisting of young Social Democrats such as Palme, Ingvar Carlsson, and Bengt K. Å. Johansson. In the 1960s, Erlander began to call his group of young aides &quot;the boys&quot;. Erlander frequently consulted the boys on speeches he planned to make, although according to , he was rarely satisfied with the speeches they wrote.

====Election of 1958 and ATP====

Social Democratic efforts for a universal pension system continued. In 1958, a bill was proposed that would provide uniform, state-administered pensions to all Swedes over the age of 67. Left wing parties supported the bill, while right wing parties opposed it. It was defeated in a vote of 117 against to 111 for. Following this loss, Erlander asked the king to temporarily dissolve the Riksdag and called for a snap election. In the ensuing election, the party won 46.2%, an increase from the 1956 election. This was the third, and, as of 2024, last snap election in Swedish history.

In the spring of 1959, the Social Democratic pension system was again being voted on in the Riksdag. In the second chamber, the vote was evenly split, 115 for and 115 against. Ture Königson, a Liberal, chose to vote in support of the Socialist&#x27;s proposal. Königson preferred his party&#x27;s pension plan, but desired a secure future for Sweden&#x27;s older workers, and reasoned that the Socialists&#x27; plan was better than a permanent political stalemate. Through his vote, the smallest possible margin, the pension plan passed. The system, called Allmän tilläggspension () or ATP for short, was successful implemented in 1960.

====Election of 1960====

In the 1960 general election, the Social Democrats&#x27; percentage of the vote was up to 47.79%, another increase from the previous election. Erlander described the election as an &quot;ideological breakthrough&quot;, which allowed the Social Democrats to pursue further reform.

====Wennerström scandal====

On June 20, 1963, Col. Stig Wennerström was arrested on his way to work, and charged with espionage. He soon admitted to spying for the Soviet Union for 15 years, and it was later estimated that had sold around 160 Swedish defense secrets to the Soviet government. Minister of Defence Sven Andersson had been informed of suspicions against Wennerström four years earlier and had become personally suspicious of him two years earlier, as had Foreign Minister Undén. Erlander, however, had not known about the suspicions until the day Wennerström was arrested. Undén&#x27;s successor, Foreign Minister Torsten Nilsson informed him via telephone the day of the arrest while Erlander was in a restaurant in Italy on vacation with his wife, and asked him to return to Sweden immediately.

Upon returning to Sweden, in response to criticism over the lack of government coordination, Erlander stated on television that, &quot;It is impossible for the government to be informed of every person who is under suspicion. We need more proof in a democratic society before we can take action.&quot; It later surfaced that twice in 1962, meetings were scheduled with Erlander to discuss Wennerström, but the first was canceled due to the minister of Justice being ill, and the second was canceled due to Erlander&#x27;s schedule being full. Opposition parties demanded a parliamentary investigation, and Bertil Ohlin led the opposition&#x27;s push for the censure of Sven Andersson and Östen Undén for negligence. In 1964, after two days of debate in the Riksdag, Andersson was not found guilty of gross negligence, and Ohlin dropped plans for a vote of censure. Simultaneously, the lower chamber voted 116 to 105 to clear Undén of negligence charges. Erlander stated that he would regard votes of censure as a question of confidence in his entire cabinet, and that it was &quot;a tragedy&quot; that Wennerström&#x27;s arrest and trial became a political issue.

Also in 1964, Wennerström was found guilty on three counts of gross espionage, was stripped of his rank, and was ordered to pay the government $98,000 of the $200,000 he was paid by the Soviet government. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. The entire arrest, trial, investigation, and scandal took up much of Erlander&#x27;s energy for almost a year.

====Election of 1964====
In the 1964 general election, the Social Democrats won 47.27% of the vote, a slight decrease overall from 1960, but the party now obtained a majority in the second chamber. The Social Democratic campaign slogan was, &quot;You never had it so good&quot;. The Left Party made larger gains that year, as they won 3 new seats in the second chamber (in addition to the 5 they previously won) and were the only party to increase their percentage from the previous election.

====Traffic change====

In a 1955 referendum, a proposal was put forward to switch Sweden from left-handed driving to right-handed driving. The referendum results overwhelmingly rejecting the proposal, with 82.9 percent of voters voting no to the switch and only 15.5% in support, although the voter turnout was considered low. Despite the general lack of support, efforts continued well into the next decade. In 1963, the Riksdag voted in a majority to switch traffic to the right side, despite the public&#x27;s rejection of the idea in the 1955 referendum. This sparked backlash, and in response, Erlander stated, &quot;The referendum was only advisory, after all.&quot;

Following the 1963 Riksdag vote, the project began to go underway. Olof Palme, now Minister for Communications (Transport), oversaw the project, which was often seen as a way to bring Sweden in line with the driving standards of most of Europe.

Debates were held over the proposed change, with pro-switch politicians arguing the change would reduce the number of traffic accidents. A massive advertising campaign was carried out to shift public opinion. On September 3, 1967, an event known as Dagen H, Sweden began the drastic change, with an estimated 360,000 street signs needing to be changed overnight. The final cost was expected to exceed 800 million Swedish krona. Initially the number of accidents went down, but the number reached pre-1967 levels by 1969.

====Unicameral Riksdag====
In 1954, Erlander met Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Winston Churchill, and the two discussed different electoral systems. Churchill was surprised to learn that Sweden did not have a system of majority voting in single-member constituencies. Erlander explained the reason was because that system would benefit the Social Democrats. Churchill replied, &quot;A statesman must not hesitate to do the right thing, even if it benefits his own party.&quot;

In March 1967, Sweden&#x27;s political parties finally agreed to replace the bicameral Riksdag with a unicameral chamber that would be directly elected. The Första kammaren (&quot;First chamber&quot; or upper house) voted to abolish itself on May 17, 1968, 117 for and 13 against. The Riksdag would fully become unicameral in 1971, after Erlander had retired from the premiership.

====Republic of Jamtland====
In 1963, actor Yngve Gamlin humorously declared himself president of the Republic of Jamtland, a breakaway state in Swedish territory. In 1967, Erlander invited Gamlin to Harpsund. However, when discussions did not go the way he hoped they would, Gamlin stole the plug from Erlander&#x27;s boat, .

====Election of 1968====

In the 1968 general election, Erlander&#x27;s final election as prime minister, his party won 50.1%, the Social Democrats&#x27; largest victory under his leadership. They had also obtained a proper majority. This would be the last bicameral election in Sweden.

===Popularity and public image===
Erlander was initially somewhat controversial, paritially because he was not considered an obvious successor to Per Albin Hansson. When he became prime minister, many Swedes didn&#x27;t know who he was, and he was often seen as being in Hansson&#x27;s shadow politically during the early years of his premiership. He was initially both praised and criticized for having been a university graduate. Critics believed he had not risen as far as Hansson, and he had not been a traditional worker. Liberal newspapers were optimistic, as Erlander had more education and administrative experience than Hansson, which was seen as beneficial to the party. His youth also won him both praise and concern. He was seen as a figure whose youth and stronger left-leaning ideals could bring new energy to the party. However, as he was younger than several members in his cabinet, it was feared that he would be unable to maintain party unity.

Despite initial fears about party instability, throughout his premiership, Erlander became increasingly known as a unifying figure within his party, as he came to be viewed as a centrist who would sometimes utilized both left-leaning and right leaning policies, although overall the party moved more towards the left. Erlander&#x27;s nationwide support during his premiership was at its strongest in the 1960s. While making radio broadcasts, he was criticized for his &quot;unpleasant&quot; voice. His popularity increased as television began to play an important role in Swedish politics, as Erlander&#x27;s amiable and humorous personality was more apparent. Historian Dick Harrison cites a 1962 appearance on Lennart Hyland&#x27;s popular talk show &quot;Hylands hörna&quot; where Erlander told a humorous story about a priest as the beginning of his growing popularity among the Swedish public. Also attributed to his rise in popularity was an increased emphasis on his poverty-ridden childhood and less emphasis was placed on his time at university, improving his image as a &quot;man of the people&quot;.

Erlander&#x27;s debating style was controversial, and was criticized by many, including writer . During debates, Erlander was often known to change between serious and comical tones, and those he debated were often frustrated as they could not keep pace with him.

In 1967, standard public opinion polls began in Sweden. In February, 65 percent of Social Democrats approved of his party leadership, 25 percent were unsure, and 10 percent thought his leadership was poor. In November of that same year, his approval ratings had reached 77 percent, and reached 84 percent in May 1968. After the 1968 general election, his approval within the party was 95 percent. In 1969, 54% of the general population polled showed approval of him as prime minister, while 80% approved of his leadership of the Social Democratic Party.

Erlander garnered a number of nicknames during his tenure as prime minister. He became known as &quot;Sweden&#x27;s longest Prime Minister&quot; referring to both his physical stature – – and his record tenure of 23 years (the Swedish word meaning both &#x27;long&#x27; and &#x27;tall&#x27;). Political cartoons often mocked Erlander by exaggerating his height. By the 1960s, he become generally affectionately referred to as &quot;Tage&quot; (as opposed to Erlander, Mr. Erlander, Prime Minister Erlander, etc.) within the Social Democratic Party, similar to how Per Albin Hansson had become known more as &quot;Per Albin&quot;.

===Resignation and succession===
On 1 October 1969, Erlander resigned as prime minister at 68, with an absolute majority for the Social Democrats in the second chamber since 1968. Erlander was succeeded by 42-year-old Olof Palme, who, although more radical and more controversial, had in many ways been Erlander&#x27;s student and protégé, and was endorsed by Erlander. Palme was later asked when Erlander first hinted to him that he wanted him as his successor. Palme stated, &quot;It never happened.&quot; Prior to the announcement of Palme, President of Finland Urho Kekkonen asked Erlander who his successor would be, and Erlander did not give a concrete answer. Kekkonen then asked if it would be Palme, to which Erlander responded, &quot;Never, he is far too intelligent for a Prime Minister&quot;.

==Domestic policy==
===Million programme===

Following World War II, Sweden increasingly developed a housing shortage in larger cities. In response, at the 1964 Social Democratic Party conference, the party adopted the Million Programme, a plan to build one million homes in the span of ten years. The proposal successfully passed through the Riksdag in 1965. The motto for the program was, &quot;A good home for everyone.&quot;

In 1966, during the early period of the project, during a debate he was asked what a young couple should do if they wanted to buy an apartment and start a family in Stockholm. Erlander answered, &quot;stand in the housing queue.&quot; It was intended as an honest answer, but was unpopular, as the wait for an apartment in Stockholm was found to be ten years long, and it is said to have been the cause of Social Democratic losses in the municipal elections that year.

Additionally, critics argued that the Million Programme created a form of segregation, with more recent evidence indicating that creating uniformity and separating this housing from more high-quality housing was part of the plan. In 1965, in response to this criticism, Erlander defended the program by arguing that American racial tensions and segregation didn&#x27;t exist in and couldn&#x27;t be reproduced in Sweden. Erlander stated, &quot;We Swedes live in an infinitely more fortunate situation. The population of our country is homogeneous, not only in regard to race, but also in many other aspects.&quot; Critics also argued that the new housing was somewhat ugly and visually monotonous.

Despite this, the goal of 1,000,000 homes was successfully reached by 1974, with 1,006,000 homes built, which, at the time, solved most of the problem, though not all of it. The Social Democrats were eventually able to recover from the municipal losses.

===Economic policy===
In 1947, a tax reform was carried out that reduced income taxes in low-income brackets, introduced an inheritance tax, and raised the marginal tax rate for higher tax brackets. Also in 1947, a special law was passed “setting up principles governing the construction and operation of homes for the aged.”

In 1959, Erlander&#x27;s government proposed raising the previously lowed income taxes, partially to provide funding for recent welfare programs. Conservative parties opposed the proposal, and the Left Party abstained from voting in the Second Chamber, allowing the proposal to go into law.

In 1962, Sweden joined the G10, being one of ten countries that agreed to provide an additional $6 billion each in funding to the International Monetary Fund.

In 1964, Erlander&#x27;s government proposed a new budget that would begin on July 1 of that year. The total budget would be $4.858 billion (in 1964), an increase from the previous budget by $475 million. The expected deficit was $180 million, and to prevent it from increasing, Erlander&#x27;s government proposed ending deductions of old-age pension fees from taxable income. About half the budget was expected to be spent on welfare-related benefits and programs.

On average, during Erlander&#x27;s premiership, Sweden&#x27;s GNP increased roughly 2.5% a year. It rose 5% in 1963 and 6% in 1964.

===Social policy===

Under Erlander, the central pillars of the Swedish welfare state were enacted between 1946 and 1947, a period known as the Social Democratic &quot;Harvest Time.&quot; In 1946 and 1947, three major reforms were enacted that introduced a basic pension, general child allowances and sickness cash benefits. The National Housing Board was set up as the central authority providing subsidized loans and rent controls, while the National Labor Market Board was established to coordinate the nationalized local employment offices and supervise the union-controlled but state-subsidized unemployment insurance funds. From 1946 onwards, an extensive system of scholarships and fellowships was provided for higher education, along with free lunches, school books and writing materials for all primary and elementary school children.

In 1948, a general child allowance was made payable to all persons in Sweden with at least one child under the age of 16. In 1947, housing allowances for families with children were introduced. In 1954, housing allowances were introduced for pensioners. In 1960, the income-test for the children&#x27;s pension was abolished. In 1950, a ten-year experimental period was established to build up a nine-year compulsory comprehensive school to replace the old parallel system. A law of 1955 provided state subsidies for municipally organized vocational schools, while a law of 1958 provided state subsidies for adult education centers. In 1962, a final decision was made on nine-year comprehensive school; implemented over a ten-year period. A law of 1964 revised upper secondary school; introduced special preparatory vocational school () to complement the high school (&quot;gymnasium&quot;). A law of 1964 expanded higher education; new decentralized universities and colleges. A law of 1967 instituted municipal adult education (). In 1955, medical insurance that provided earnings-related benefits was introduced, and the following year the Social Democrats sponsored a law on &quot;social help&quot; which further extended social services. A maternity allowance was introduced in 1962 that provided a six-month period of paid leave to new mothers, and a reform of unemployment benefits in 1968 doubled the maximum duration of such benefits from 30 to 60 weeks. In addition, a number of laws concerning vacations, worker&#x27;s safety and working hours were introduced.

Erlander coined the phrase &quot;the strong society&quot;, describing a society with a growing public sector taking care of the growing demand on many services that an affluent society creates. The public sector, particularly its welfare state institutions, grew considerably during his tenure as Prime Minister, while nationalizations were rare. In order to maintain employment for his vast electorate and Swedish sovereignty as a non-NATO member, the armed forces was greatly expanded, reaching an impressive level by the 1960s, while nuclear capability was ultimately dropped after outcries, not least from the Social Democratic Women&#x27;s League.

===Nuclear weapons===

The question of nuclear weapons as a means to deter a possible attack remained a divisive factor in Swedish society and among Social Democrats and prompted diplomatic agreements with the United States, guaranteeing intervention in the case of an invasion. Erlander was initially in favor of acquiring nuclear weapons as a means of defense, but received criticism for this position. Following a 1954 report by Supreme Commander Nils Swedlund, who advocated for Sweden acquiring nuclear weapons to maintain neutrality, Erlander sought to avoid public debate on the issue so his party could develop a unified position and then collaborate with the opposition. However, the Social Democrats became split on the issue while the Moderates publicly pushed for nuclear weapons. The largest opposition within Erlander&#x27;s party came from the Social Democrat Women&#x27;s Organization (SSKF).

The first government meeting on the issue occurred in November 1955, and the Social Democratic Party held a discussion in February 1956. Erlander had his anti-nuclear foreign minister Östen Undén discuss ongoing UN nuclear disarmament talks. Erlander also proposed delaying the decision until 1958, because, according to him, the government lacked sufficient knowledge about the technical prerequisites to have nuclear weapons, and that he did not want to complicate the disarmament talks by producing nuclear weapons at that time. After Undén&#x27;s presentation, SSKF chair Inga Thorsson declared that her organization publicly opposed nuclear weapons, but the board ultimately followed Erlander&#x27;s proposed postponement.

During a March 1959 debate in the Riksdag, Erlander implied that he did not want to add to the &quot;limited number of countries&quot; with atomic weapons, pending the results of a nuclear summit. Sweden signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 1968, dropping all pretenses of developing a nuclear weapon. However, some nuclear reactors were kept secret from IAEA until 1994, and small teams of theoretical physicists continued researching nuclear weapons after Erlander&#x27;s premiership. Some international observers speculated that Erlander and future Swedish leaders maintained interest in a hypothetical nuclear system for defense, but did not take action to develop one. According to Erlander&#x27;s memoirs, Swedish military chiefs believed in limited nuclear war, inspired by Henry Kissinger&#x27;s advocation of the policy, as it was a &quot;defense strategy that appeared to be made for a small state&#x27;s defense&quot;.

==Foreign policy==
===Cold War neutrality and international alliances===
Under Erlander, Sweden had to navigate the challenges of the Cold War. Sweden did not officially side with either the United States or the Soviet Union, although Sweden&#x27;s official position has been described as a &quot;non-alliance&quot;, rather than &quot;neutral&quot;, and Erlander once stated that Sweden shared an &quot;ideological affinity with the Western democracies.&quot; Sweden&#x27;s firm stance on neutrality was supported by Erlander and his foreign minister Undén, who were seen as the two leading figures of the Social Democratic Party.

Erlander represented Sweden at the funerals of several foreign heads of state, such as those of United States President John F. Kennedy in 1963 and West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in 1967.

Negotiations for a Scandinavian defence union began in 1948, with Erlander and Danish Prime Minister Hans Hedtoft being its strongest proponents. The proposal fell apart and was shelved in January 1949 due to Norwegian resistance and the country&#x27;s acceptance of membership in NATO, with Denmark and Iceland following suit. In Erlander&#x27;s 1952 United States tour, he stated that Sweden would not join NATO. Erlander was generally considered a pro-Western leader despite this, and wrote that America was doing Europe a great service by allowing itself to increase their arms for defense against the Soviet Union. 

In 1961, Erlander and President John F. Kennedy advocated for the West to strengthen the United Nations and its Secretary General, Swedish politician Dag Hammarskjöld. Erlander was a strong supporter of the proposed Nordic economic community Nordek, and held meetings on the subject with Finnish President Urho Kekkonen and Prime Minister Mauno Koivisto in 1969.

===United States and Vietnam War===
In 1952, as part of his U.S. tour, Erlander visited United States President Harry S. Truman, which was the first time a Swedish Prime Minister and a U.S. president met. Erlander would later meet Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson.

In 1958, Sweden recognized South Vietnam. They established diplomatic relations in Saigon in 1960, but did not establish an official ambassador there.

In the 1960s, Erlander and the Swedish government became critical of the Vietnam War. Despite Erlander&#x27;s personal opposition to the war and the uneasy nature of U.S.-Sweden relations at that point, William Womack Heath, the U.S. ambassador to Sweden during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, found Erlander to be &quot;completely pro-American&quot; from 1967 until early 1968.

On February 21, 1968, Olof Palme participated in a torchlight parade through Stockholm with North Vietnam&#x27;s ambassador to Moscow, Nguyễn Thọ Chân, to protest the Vietnam War, an event which soured Swedish relations with the United States and stirred controversy worldwide, and led to Heath being recalled for &quot;consultations&quot;, with no immediate successor appointed. Moderate leader Yngve Holmberg called for Palme&#x27;s resignation from the cabinet, but the demand was not met. By March 1968, Sweden had accepted 79 draft-dodgers from the United States, and Erlander, soon followed by opposition party leaders, publicly stated his opposition to the Vietnam War.

===Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact===
In 1950, Erlander condemned the aggression of North Korea that began the Korean War, deeming it, &quot;a deed of violence calculated to imperil world peace&quot;. Sweden then dispatched a field hospital in South Korea. In June 1952, during the war, the Soviet Union shot down two Swedish military aircraft, an event known as the Catalina affair.

Erlander and Hedlund planned a visit the Soviet Union in 1956 to ease tensions, the first time a Swedish prime minister visited the country. However, Erlander was willing to cancel the trip should the Soviet government have refused to accept the information the Swedish government had collected on Raoul Wallenberg, a businessman and humanitarian who had served as Sweden&#x27;s special envoy in Budapest. Wallenberg disappeared during the Siege of Budapest after his arrest by Soviet forces in 1945. Since 1952, the Swedish government had demanded Wallenberg&#x27;s return, but the Soviet Union insisted it was unfamiliar with him. During the visit, which occurred as expected, Erlander questioned Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev about Wallenberg&#x27;s status, and presented Khrushchev with a large file of evidence that showed the Soviet Union&#x27;s connection to Wallenberg&#x27;s disappearance. Khrushchev examined it and stated that Swedish-Soviet relations would be positive if the Wallenberg affair was dropped. Soviet documents stated that Wallenberg died in a cell in 1947 of a heart attack, but Erlander, the Swedish government, and international observers were skeptical. Wallenberg biographer Ingrid Carlberg noted that Soviet documents declassified after the fall of the Soviet Union about Wallenberg existed, which Khrushchev had denied, and that on Wallenberg&#x27;s official Soviet prison card the crime he was arrested for was unspecified.

In 1959, Khrushchev planned to visit Scandinavia and Finland, but the Swedish press and opposition reacted negatively to the idea, causing Khrushchev to &quot;postpone&quot; it. Erlander and Undén expressed disappointment in Khrushchev&#x27;s decision, to which he responded during a speech in Moscow that the decision was because of the Swedish government taking no steps to counter the negative press. Erlander stated that the government could not polemicize against these opinions, as he felt that it would give them undue importance. The government then avoided appointing the anti-Khrushchev leader of the Conservatives, Jarl Hjalmarson, to Sweden&#x27;s UN delegation. While travelling for his United States visit, Khrushchev sent Erlander a message of &quot;friendship&quot; to ensure the postponed visit was still possible.

In 1963, after the arrest of Stig Wennerström, Erlander stated that the case had seriously disturbed relations between Sweden and the Soviet Union. Nikita Khrushchev had planned a goodwill tour of Scandinavia in 1964, which was to begin 10 days after Wennerström had been given a life sentence. Erlander declined to state how the sentencing might affect Khrushchev&#x27;s visit.

During that 1964 visit, while receiving Khrushchev at Harpsund, Erlander took Khrushchev and his interpreter in an eka rowing boat called the Harpsundseka across the 300-yard lake nearby. It has since become tradition for Swedish prime ministers and foreign heads of state to row across the lake in the Harpsundseka when they visit Harpsund. In that same visit, Erlander was once again unable to get information out of Khrushchev relating to Raoul Wallenberg. Khrushchev continued denying that Wallenberg was in the Soviet Union, and Erlander and the government expressed &quot;deep disappointment&quot; over the lack of development in the case. There were anti-Khrushchev protests in Sweden from Soviet exiles upon his visit, and the Swedish press criticized him as a liar relating to his discussions over Wallenberg and the stringent security (3000 police officers upon his arrival) around him. Both Khrushchev and Erlander ultimately stated they were pleased with the visit, and Khrushchev left for Norway on June 27 as part of his Scandinavian goodwill tour. Khrushchev did not mention the Wallenberg controversy or the negative press he received in his farewell address. After visiting the Soviet Union in 1965, Erlander stated that the case had to be closed.

In 1968, tensions rose between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union due to the former&#x27;s implementation of political reforms. The Swedish public expected their government to support Czechoslovakia given its opposition to the Vietnam War, but the government wished to maintain neutrality. In July, Soviet politician Alexei Kosygin visited Stockholm, which caused the Liberal leader Sven Wedén to give a speech rebuking Erlander&#x27;s perceived neglect of Czechoslovak self-determination. In response, Erlander and Foreign Minister Torsten Nilsson cited as a reason for their caution a secret report by Agda Rössel, the ambassador in Belgrade, who stated that Czechoslovak leaders desired Western silence. Although the government&#x27;s response was not as strong as it had been to the Vietnam War, when the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia began, Erlander, the Social Democrats, and all opposition parties condemned it. The Social Democrats&#x27; opposition to the invasion likely helped them electorally in 1968.

===South Africa and Apartheid===

In the 1960s, after Erlander finished giving a speech to students at Lund University, South African Lund student and anti-apartheid activist Billy Modise personally asked Erlander to impose sanctions on South Africa in response to apartheid. Erlander stated that he did not have the power to do so, but advised Modise to publicly lobby for the policy. Olof Palme was also an advocate for sanctions against South Africa, and became more outspoken on his opposition to aparthied after he joined Erlander&#x27;s cabinet in 1963.

The Swedish South Africa Committee was created in 1961. In 1963, the National Council of Swedish Youth launched a boycott against South African goods. Erlander and Palme were among the sponsors of the committee.
Swedish donations to the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa (IDAF) increased around 140,000 SEK. The number continued to go up when, in 1964, Sweden became the first industrialized Western country to donate public funds to the IDAF, the equivalent of $100,000. In the end, Sweden was the largest donar by far.

===Israel===

In 1947, Sweden voted in favor of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. In 1948, Sweden recognized Israel. Sweden established an embassy in Israel in 1951.

In 1962, Erlander became the first Swedish prime minister to visit Israel. During his visit, Erlander was famously photographed swimming in the Dead Sea. He spoke to Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. According to Erlander, no specific policies were discussed, although he stated he hoped the visit would strengthen Israeli-Swedish relations. Erlander stated that he was &quot;fascinated&quot; by the country, and he invited Premier Ben-Gurion to visit Sweden. Ben-Guiron visited Sweden later that year.

==Later life and death==
After his resignation, Erlander and his wife lived in a house constructed at Bommersvik by the Social Democrats to honor him, and was owned by the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League.

Erlander remained in the Riksdag for several years after it became unicameral. Following the 1970 general election, he once again changed constituencies, now representing Gothenburg, which followed 22 years as a Stockholm representative. He resigned from the Riksdag in 1973, after holding seats there for over forty years.

After leaving leadership roles, Erlander began sorting through his personal papers, and chose to use them to help write his political memoirs. He wrote an article for Svenska Dagbladet in 1972 explaining his motives for doing so. The memoirs were published in six volumes from 1972 to 1982. In the 1980s, Erlander allowed writer unlimited access to his diaries, which would serve as a source for Ruin&#x27;s biography of Erlander.

Erlander died on 21 June 1985 in Stockholm at the age of 84 from pneumonia and heart failure. Erlander&#x27;s coffin was covered with a socialist flag and blue and yellow flowers (the colors of the Swedish flag), and was carried through Stockholm. An estimated 45,000 Swedes lined the streets to pay respects to him. A large, secular ceremony was held in Stockholm, wherein Olof Palme delivered Erlander&#x27;s eulogy. At the end of the service, the audience sang the socialist hymn &quot;The Internationale&quot;. After the Stockholm ceremony, his funeral crossed the country and returned to his home town of Ransäter, Värmland, in a triumphant procession for the final rest. His wife, who died in 1990, is buried beside him.

==Ideology and political positions==

Despite Erlander being familiar with the writings of Karl Marx and identifying as a socialist, he did not subscribe to full Marxism and did not support nationalization, instead believing in a strong public sector under well-regulated capitalism with social welfare programs. Based on his university studies, Erlander believed that Keynesian economics and Stockholm School economics were compatible with social democracy, and could be useful in ending economic slumps. Unlike many other left-leaning intellectuals, Erlander did not sympathize with the Soviet Union, although he did attempt to maintain positive Swedish-Soviet relations.

On the role of politicians, Erlander reportedly stated that, &quot;A politician&#x27;s job is to build the dance floor, so that everyone can dance as they please.&quot;

Erlander acknowledged the need for women to play a larger role in politics and hold cabinet positions. However, he had disputes or grievances with all the women who actually did serve in his cabinet.

Erlander had a good relationship with Moderate Party leader Jarl Hjalmarson, although he viewed Hjalmarson as a &quot;political lightweight.&quot; Erlander hoped in 1968 that later Moderate leader Yngve Holmberg would remain in office due to the disorganization of the opposition parties and Holmberg&#x27;s perceived &quot;clunkiness&quot;. Erlander admired the writings of Adlai Stevenson II, because Stevenson &quot;expressed his views more deftly than he could himself&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Family &amp; living situation===
He met his future wife Aina Andersson while they were both students at Lund University. They married in 1930. Their marriage has been described as &quot;deeply harmonious&quot; and &quot;full of mutual trust&quot;, and Erlander&#x27;s family life as &quot;remarkably happy&quot;. Their son Sven was a mathematician who published much of the content of his father&#x27;s diaries from 2001 on. Erlander&#x27;s mother, Alma, died in 1961, at age 92, during her son&#x27;s premiership.

Through one Erlander&#x27;s Finnish ancestors, Simon Larsson (née Kauttoinen) (c.1605-1696), he is a distant relative of Stefan Löfven, the Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden from 2014 to 2021.

 gave Harpsund to the Swedish government as a country retreat for prime ministers in 1953. Erlander starting using it as a vacation home that year, and all prime ministers since have continued this practice. Erlander and his wife often spent Christmases, Easters, weekends, and summers at vacationing at Harpsund. For most of his career, the Erlander family lived in an apartment in Bromma, Stockholm, until the summer of 1964, when they moved to an apartment in a high-rise complex in Stockholm&#x27;s Gamla stan (Old Town) district. Earlier in his career, Erlander traveled via subway to and from work rather than use a car, although eventually he and Aina bought one. After getting the car, Aina would usually drive him to work, as he did not have a driver&#x27;s license, dropping him off and then driving to the school where she worked. When Aina was unable to take him, neighbors in Bromma usually offered him rides. Erlander did not have an official car to travel in, and visiting foreign heads of state were often surprised to see that he usually arrived at events alone.

===Personality, interests, &amp; habits===
Erlander was known to be a dedicated diarist, often writing daily entries, with his diaries serving as key sources for his memoirs. Erlander wrote on a variety of subjects, and initially wrote to help him remember things related to his work, such as occurrences, arguments, and decisions, going into greater detail on matters he thought were controversial. He also wrote about matters including his family, his health at the time, plays he saw and books he read, and his impressions of other people. Erlander would later frequently note that his diaries contained many exaggerations.

Erlander was often described as a &quot;fatherly&quot; or &quot;avuncular&quot;. Ingvar Carlsson stated that to him, Erlander became like a second father or a guide. Biographers Harrison and Ruin note that although Erlander was in power longer than any other Swedish leader, he didn&#x27;t seek power for himself, which Carlsson affirmed.

Erlander was an avid lover of literature and theatre, which often served as a source of recreation. Erlander&#x27;s favorite novel was John Steinbeck&#x27;s Cannery Row. Many contemporary Swedish writers were often surprised to learn that their prime minister had read their work.

During his premiership, Erlander often visited his former college Lund University, meeting the Värmland Student Association. At one of these meetings, Student Association members and proposed that Erlander should give annual speeches to Lund students, to which Erlander agreed. In total, he gave fourteen of these student addresses.

==Legacy==
Erlander served as prime minister for 23 years, making him the longest-serving one in Swedish history. His uninterrupted tenure as head of the government is also the longest ever in any modern Western democracy. Two of Erlander&#x27;s closest advisors, Olof Palme and Ingvar Carlsson, also became prime ministers of Sweden, and together their tenures equal more than 40 years.

Upon his death, The Washington Post described Erlander as &quot;one of the most popular political leaders&quot;. Erlander has been dubbed a &quot;political giant&quot; who transformed Sweden&#x27;s political climate and brought the nation together. He has been compared to other notable Swedish &quot;political giants&quot; such as Palme and Dag Hammarskjöld. Biographer Dick Harrison and journalist Per Olov Enquist have described Erlander as a &quot;father of the country&quot; (). Ruin notes that as Sweden encountered difficulties in the 1970s, nostalgia sometimes influenced positive views of Erlander, and that his time as leader was looked upon by some as a &quot;golden age&quot; of Swedish history. During his premiership, despite disagreements between parties, particularly the Liberals and Moderates supporting lower taxes, Sweden&#x27;s major political parties began to increasingly agree on the goal of developing Sweden as a welfare state.

Some conservative and liberal analysts have argued that during Erlander&#x27;s premiership an air of Sweden becoming a de facto one-party state developed. Critics of Olof Palme have also criticized Erlander for his role in Palme&#x27;s ascension to the premiership. In general, following Sweden&#x27;s economic crises in the 1970s, the Swedish Model, and to some extent Erlander&#x27;s premiership, was scrutinized more.

Left Party leader Nooshi Dadgostar praised Erlander in 2022, citing him as an inspiration who passed reforms laying the foundation of Sweden&#x27;s welfare state.

The building that served as Erlander&#x27;s childhood home and schoolhouse in Ransäter is now a museum named centered around him and his life.

The Tage Erlander Prize, given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, is a prize for research in natural sciences, technology, and mathematics which is named after Erlander.

== Awards ==
Erlander was a nominee for the 1971 Nobel Peace Prize, although he didn&#x27;t win.

Erlander was awarded the Illis quorum in 1984.

==In popular culture==
In the 2013 comedy film &quot;The Hundred-Year Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared&quot;, Erlander was portrayed by Swedish actor Johan Rheborg.

In the 2021 series &quot;&quot;, which depicted the Haijby scandal, Erlander was portrayed by Swedish actor Emil Almén.

In the 2022 Netflix series &quot;Clark&quot;, which depicted the life of Swedish criminal Clark Olofsson, Erlander was portrayed by Swedish actor Claes Malmberg.

<text>International Women&#x27;s Day (IWD) is a holiday celebrated annually as a focal point in the women&#x27;s rights movement. IWD gives focus to issues such as gender equality, reproductive rights, and violence and abuse against women. Spurred by the universal female suffrage movement, IWD originated from labor movements in Europe and North America during the early 20th century, with the modern holiday, March 8th, being declared by Vladimir Lenin.

The earliest version reported was a &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; organized by the Socialist Party of America in New York City on February 28, 1909. This inspired German delegates at the 1910 International Socialist Women&#x27;s Conference in Copenhagen to propose &quot;a special Women&#x27;s Day&quot; be organized annually, albeit with no set date; the following year saw the first demonstrations and commemorations of International Women&#x27;s Day across Europe. Vladimir Lenin declared March 8th as IWD in 1922 to honour the women&#x27;s role in 1917 Russian Revolution; it was subsequently celebrated on that date by the socialist movement and communist countries. The holiday became a mainstream global holiday following its promotion by the United Nations in 1977.

International Women&#x27;s Day is a public holiday in several countries. 
The UN observes the holiday in connection with a particular issue, campaign, or theme in women&#x27;s rights.

==History==
===Origins===

The earliest reported Women&#x27;s Day event, called &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot;, was held on February 28, 1909, in New York City. It was organized by the Socialist Party of America at the suggestion of activist Theresa Malkiel. There have been claims that the day was commemorating a protest by women garment workers in New York on March 8, 1857, but researchers have described this as a myth.

In August 1910, an International Socialist Women&#x27;s Conference was organized ahead of the general meeting of the Socialist Second International in Copenhagen, Denmark. Inspired in part by the American socialists, German delegates Clara Zetkin, Käte Duncker, Paula Thiede, and others proposed the establishment of an annual &quot;Women&#x27;s Day&quot;, although no date was specified. The 100 delegates, representing 17 countries, agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights, including women&#x27;s suffrage.

The following year, on March 19, 1911, the first International Women&#x27;s Day was marked by over a million people in Austria-Hungary, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland. In Austria-Hungary alone, there were 300 demonstrations, with women parading on the Ringstrasse in Vienna, carrying banners honoring the martyrs of the Paris Commune. Across Europe, women demanded the right to vote and to hold public office, and protested against employment sex discrimination.

IWD initially had no set date, though it was generally celebrated in late February or early March. Americans continued to observe &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; on the last Sunday in February, while Russia observed International Women&#x27;s Day for the first time in 1913, on the last Saturday in February (albeit based on the Julian calendar, as in the Gregorian calendar, the date was March 8). In 1914, International Women&#x27;s Day was held on March 8 for the first time in Germany, possibly because that date was a Sunday. As elsewhere, Germany&#x27;s observance was dedicated to women&#x27;s right to vote, which German women did not win until 1918. Concurrently, there was a march in London in support of women&#x27;s suffrage, during which Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested in front of Charing Cross station on her way to speak in Trafalgar Square.

===The Russian Revolution and Communist countries===
On March 8, 1917, in Petrograd (February 23, 1917, on the Julian calendar), women textile workers began a demonstration that eventually engulfed the whole city, demanding &quot;Bread and Peace&quot;—an end to World War I, to food shortages, and to Tsarism. This marked the beginning of the February Revolution, which alongside the October Revolution, made up the Russian Revolution. Revolutionary leader Leon Trotsky wrote, &quot;23 February (8th March) was International Woman&#x27;s Day and meetings and actions were foreseen. But we did not imagine that this &#x27;Women&#x27;s Day&#x27; would inaugurate the revolution. Revolutionary actions were foreseen but without a date. But in the morning, despite the orders to the contrary, textile workers left their work in several factories and sent delegates to ask for the support of the strike… which led to mass strike... all went out into the streets.&quot; Seven days later, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated, and the provisional Government granted women the right to vote.

After the Russian Revolution, Bolsheviks began to celebrate the International Women&#x27;s Day on 8 March as it marked the beginning of revolutionary changes in 1917 in Russia. However, it was not officially declared as such for some time. For example, the first congress of the newly founded Communist International could only adopt a very brief &quot;Resolution on the Role of Working Women&quot; submitted by Alexandra Kollontai on 6 March 1919, which made no mention of 8 March or IWD. The second congress convened next year couldn&#x27;t even find time for it, although it began holding an &quot;International Conference of Communist Women&quot; (organized by a newly created &quot;International Secretariat on Work Amongst Women&quot;) under its auspices. It was only during the third world congress of Communist International in 1921 that an important document titled &quot;Methods and Forms of Work Among Communist Party Women: Theses&quot; was adopted as a result of the work of the Second International Conference of Communist Women held in parallel to this congress. The theses mentioned &quot;organizing an annual International Working Women&#x27;s Day&quot; among the tasks of central women&#x27;s department of communist parties.

After its adoption in Soviet Russia, IWD was predominantly celebrated in communist countries and by the communist movement worldwide. In the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, huge Soviet-style celebrations were held annually. 
Chinese communists observed the holiday beginning in 1922, though it soon gained traction across the political spectrum. In 1927, Guangzhou saw a march of 25,000 women and male supporters, including representatives of the Kuomintang, the YWCA, and labor organizations. After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on October 1, 1949, the State Council proclaimed on December 23 that March 8 would be made an official holiday, with women given a half-day off.

Hujum (; in Turkic languages, &quot;storming&quot; or &quot;assault&quot;, from ) was a series of policies and actions taken by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, initiated by Joseph Stalin on International Women&#x27;s Day in 1927, to remove all manifestations of gender inequality, especially the systems of female veiling and seclusion practiced in Central Asia. On May 8, 1965, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet issued a decree to make March 8, International Women&#x27;s Day, a non-working public holiday &#x27;in honor of the outstanding achievements of the Soviet women in building communism, defending the motherland during the Great Patriotic War, their heroism and selflessness both at the front and at home, and for their great contribution to the strengthening of friendship among peoples, and to the struggle for peace&#x27;. 

===Other countries, 1920s to 1960s===
In 1928, Australia first observed International Women&#x27;s Day, a rally in Sydney&#x27;s Domain organized by the Militant Women&#x27;s Group of the Communist Party. At that rally, held on March 25, women rallied in support of fully paid annual holidays, equal pay for equal work, female store clerks having eight-hour days, an end to piece work, and a basic wage for those without employment. Later, the first International Women&#x27;s Day marches happened in Sydney and Melbourne, in 1931. The Sydney march featured approximately sixty women leading three hundred to five hundred marchers. The Melbourne march consisted of fifty women leading one hundred and fifty marchers, with a banner in front stating, &quot;Long Live International Women&#x27;s Day&quot;. In 1938, the first major International Women&#x27;s Day meeting in Perth was held; in attendance were women from the Association of University Women, Jewish Women, Mothers Union, Movement Against War and Fascism, National Council of Women, Spanish Relief Committee, Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom, Women&#x27;s Section of Primary Producers, Women&#x27;s Service Guilds, Young Labor League, and YWCA.

Communist leader Dolores Ibárruri led a women&#x27;s march in Madrid in 1936 on the eve of the Spanish Civil War.

The Congress of American Women was an American women&#x27;s rights organization founded in New York on International Women&#x27;s Day in 1946, following the 1945 founding conference of the Women&#x27;s International Democratic Federation in Paris, to which it affiliated. Its primary organizer was Elinor S. Gimbel (wife of Louis S. Gimbel, Jr., grandson of Adam Gimbel of Gimbels department store.) In 1948 the organization was attacked as a communist front organization by the House Un-American Activities Committee and was forced to register as a &quot;subversive&quot; organization. The organization was finally dissolved in 1950. The congress was an official US branch of the Women&#x27;s International Democratic Federation, which though an antifascist organization was pro-Soviet. The organization supported progressive policies giving women full rights and equality both in the home and economically. They supported labor organizing and civil rights and were against anticommunist attacks on liberals. Though many members were communists or part of the popular front, membership in the organization included a broad mix of liberal, middle-class women.

In 1956 in Singapore, Chan Choy Siong, along with Ho Puay Choo and Oh Siew Chen, created the Women&#x27;s League within the People&#x27;s Action Party, and that year, to recognize International Women&#x27;s Day, the League organized four rallies across Singapore, which attracted more than 2,000 people in total.

In 1958, Christina F. Lewis organized the first International Women&#x27;s Day observance in Trinidad and Tobago.

In 1965, Anahita Ratebzad along with other members of the Democratic Organisation of Afghan Women (DOAW) organized a protest march on March 8 in Kabul, which was the first observance of International Women&#x27;s Day in Afghanistan.

===Second–wave feminism===

IWD remained predominantly a communist holiday until circa 1967 when it was taken up by second-wave feminists. The day re-emerged as a day of activism, and is sometimes known in Europe as the &quot;Women&#x27;s International Day of Struggle&quot;. In the 1970s and 1980s, women&#x27;s groups were joined by leftists and labor organizations in calling for equal pay, equal economic opportunity, equal legal rights, reproductive rights, subsidized child care, and the prevention of violence against women.

International Women&#x27;s Day had been largely forgotten in the United States by the late 1960s, before an activist called Laura X organized a march in Berkeley, California, on International Women&#x27;s Day in 1969. The march led to the creation of The Women&#x27;s History Research Center, a central archive of the women&#x27;s movement from 1968 to 1974. Laura X also thought it unfair for half the human race, meaning women, to have only one day a year and called for National Women&#x27;s History Month to be built around International Women&#x27;s Day. The Women&#x27;s History Research Center collected nearly one million documents on microfilm, and provided resources and records of the women&#x27;s liberation movement that are now available through the National Women&#x27;s History Alliance, which carried on their ideas, including successfully petitioning Congress to declare March as Women&#x27;s History Month.

In Australia, 1972 was when large IWD marches began.

Announced in 1978 on International Women&#x27;s Day, the Women&#x27;s Work Committee in Palestine came to represent an association willing to develop a strategy to combine national liberation and women&#x27;s liberation. The founders of the committee were disappointed in the actions of previous charitable societies as they failed to educate the general population; to rectify this issue, they launched programs promoting literacy, health education, and classes teaching embroidery. Further aiding those of a working-class background, they started daycare centers to allow them to continue working as their children were being cared for.

On International Women&#x27;s Day in 1979, a women&#x27;s march took place in Tehran in Iran. The march was originally intended to celebrate International Women&#x27;s Day, but transformed into massive protests against the changes taking place in women&#x27;s rights during the Iranian revolution, specifically the introduction of mandatory hijab (veiling), which had been announced the day before. The protests lasted for six days, from 8 March to 14 March 1979, with thousands of women participating. The protests resulted in a temporary retraction of the decree of mandatory veiling. When the left and the liberals were eliminated, and the conservatives secured sole control, however, veiling was enforced on all women.
On March 8, 1984 in Argentina, the first International Women&#x27;s Day demonstrations since the end of the country&#x27;s military regime took place in the Congressional Plaza, in what is now considered a landmark. The event was organized by the Multisectorial de la Mujer (English: Multisectorial of Women), an organization formed by members of women&#x27;s groups, feminists, housewives and representatives of political parties and unions. An emblematic moment of the protests was when activist María Elena Oddone climbed up the stairs of the Monument of the Two Congresses and raised a banner that read &quot;No to motherhood, yes to pleasure&quot;. Her banner, as well as those held by other radical feminists that day, was harshly criticized by the press for being too provocative. Oddone was also repudiated within the feminist movement. Elena Tchalidy, president of the Alicia Moreau de Justo Foundation, said: &quot;March 8 was the first public act and she walked with [that sign]. It came out in the magazine that today would be &quot;Caras&quot; or &quot;Gente&quot;. Then she said to me: &#x27;Oh, three girls came to me.&#x27; &#x27;Yes&#x27;, I told her, &#x27;and you distanced a few thousand.&#x27; Oddone recalled the meeting with the Multisectorial de la Mujer that took place two days after the event in her autobiography, claiming she replied to their &quot;lapidary critics&quot;: &quot;I am not a feminist to please anyone but to tell the truth about our condition. I did not write those banners to be liked. If they caused scandal, it is because the truth is always scandalous. We received Dr. Justo with admiration and affection. Eighty years ago, she and her companions who asked for the right to vote were called &#x27;crazy&#x27;. I am willing to wait the same number of years for my banners to be understood.&quot;

===Adoption by United Nations===

The United Nations began celebrating International Women&#x27;s Day in 1975, which had been proclaimed the International Women&#x27;s Year. In 1977, the United Nations General Assembly invited member states to &quot;proclaim in accordance with their historical and national traditions and customs, any day of the year as United Nations Day for Women&#x27;s Rights and International Peace&quot;. In common with most countries, March 8 has been traditionally recognised as the day for International Women&#x27;s Days by the UN for women&#x27;s rights and world peace. It has since been commemorated annually by the UN and much of the world, with each year&#x27;s observance centered on a particular theme or issue within women&#x27;s rights.

===Adoption by corporations===
By the twenty-first century, IWD had been criticized as heavily diluted and commercialized, particularly in the West, where it is sponsored by major corporations and used to promote general and vague notions of equality, rather than radical social reforms. The website internationalwomensday.com was established in 2001. The website was being managed by the British marketing firm Aurora Ventures with corporate sponsorship. The website began to promote hashtags as themes for the day, unconnected with the UN theme, which became used internationally. The day was commemorated by business breakfasts and social media communications that were deemed by some social critics as reminiscent of Mother&#x27;s Day greetings.

The march was held at the same time of year as the first event in 2017 and held in conjunction with International Women&#x27;s Day. Protestors took to the streets to demand that the government put a stop to systematic violence against women and pass the sexual assault eradication bill. The demands of the coalition included the establishment of a system of laws that protect women and the abolishment of discriminatory regulations.

Mexico saw women take to the streets on International Women&#x27;s Day 2020 to demand that the government be held accountable for their inability to acknowledge gender violence as an issue. They demanded that murderers be held accountable for their crimes, and that awareness be brought to the sexual and physical harassment experienced by women daily. On the day of the protest, an estimated 80,000 people took part in Mexico City. The following day, &quot;Brujas del Mar&quot;, a group of women from Veracruz led the charge of another protest. On March 9, the protest was dubbed &quot;Un Día Sin Mujeres&quot; (A Day Without Women). The aim of this subsequent protest was to simulate a world in which women did not exist. The protest encouraged women to stay home and withdraw from activities that they would normally be involved in. Women stayed home from work, school, social media and refrained from making online purchases.

Witches of Scotland was a campaign launched on International Women&#x27;s Day in 2020, led by Claire Mitchell QC and writer Zoe Venditozzi, seeking legal pardons and justice for the people, primarily women, convicted of witchcraft and executed in Scotland between 1563 and 1736. A pardon and an apology was made on International Women&#x27;s Day 2022.

The Women&#x27;s Party (Korean: 여성의당), a South Korean single-issue political party, was founded on International Women&#x27;s Day 2020 and advocates for feminism. The party calls for greater representation of women and equality in politics and an end to all forms of violence, discrimination and inequality against women in the workplace.

===2021===
On International Women&#x27;s Day 2021, politician Dave Sharma of Australia was criticized for handing out flowers to women while the Morrison Government faced ongoing scrutiny over how it had handled allegations of rape and sexual misconduct by government ministers and staffers. The gesture was seen by some as &quot;failing to read the room&quot;, and was held up as evidence of the government being out of touch on women&#x27;s rights issues.

In Guatemala City a thousand women and men marched demanding an end to violence against women on International Women&#x27;s Day 2021.

An Antimonumenta was installed next to the Fuente de las Tarascas, along in Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico, on International Women&#x27;s Day 2021, during the annual Mexican march of women protesting against gender violence. The sculpture, symbolically named Antimonumenta, was inspired by other similar anti-monuments like the one in Mexico City. The erection of an antimonumenta symbolizes the demand for justice for women who suffer from violence in the country. The original work was destroyed a few hours after its installation, but a replica was installed the following month. The original Antimonumenta was painted completely in purple and it was represented with a symbol of the feminist struggle, which is based on the symbol of Venus with a raised fist in the center. In feminism, the color purple often represents &quot;loyalty, constancy towards a purpose [and] unwavering firmness towards a cause&quot;. The Antimonumenta was a metal sculpture whose upper part had, written in Spanish, in violet capital letters: &quot;Alive, free and happy&quot;, while on the arm of the cross it was written, &quot;Not one more!&quot;. On the opposite side, the Antimonumenta had written the same phrases. The replica is painted in purple and pink, and has written on it the same slogans but now written in white. According to the installers, the Antimonumenta represents the victims of femicide, as well as a method to invoke compassion, empathy and solidarity towards their cause. Another anti-monument in Mexico was installed in Orizaba the same year the day before International Women&#x27;s Day, during International Women&#x27;s Day protests, and another was installed in Veracruz City the same year on International Women&#x27;s Day, also during International Women&#x27;s Day protests.

On International Women&#x27;s Day 2021, 5,000 women marched in San Salvador demanding decriminalization of abortion and an end to violence against women.
In the early hours of International Women&#x27;s Day 2021, the Concepción Feminist Mural in Spain was vandalized by extreme right-wing groups who erased its message and covered the faces of the 15 women in the mural with black paint, and also used banners that read &#x27;Terrorist&#x27;, &#x27;Abortionist&#x27; and &#x27;Communist&#x27;. Madrid City Council condemned the attack on the work and pledged to restore the mural.

Burger King was criticized after a tweet from Burger King UK on International Women&#x27;s Day 2021 stated, &quot;Women belong in the kitchen.&quot; The tweet was labeled as sexist by thousands of Twitter users and dozens of news publications. Burger King UK followed up, stating &quot;We&#x27;re on a mission to change the gender ratio in the restaurant industry.&quot; Eventually, after severe backlash, Burger King deleted the original tweet 12 hours later and posted an apology stating, &quot;We got our initial tweet wrong and we&#x27;re sorry.&quot;

On International Women&#x27;s Day 2021, it was announced that India and England would play a one-off women&#x27;s cricket Test later in the year. The Test was played at Bristol County Ground, between 16 and 19 June 2021.

This caused critics to accuse Suluhu of releasing Mbowe on condition of support for Western feminist policies.

===2023===
In Japan in 2023 there was a rally recognizing International Women&#x27;s Day at which a statement was delivered to lawmakers by representatives from many women&#x27;s rights groups; the statement was in favor of changing the Japanese civil code, which requires married couples to choose one last name, &quot;the surname of the husband or wife&quot;. As of 2023, 95% of Japanese women take their husbands&#x27; last name, due to sexist family values and women being considered to be marrying into their husband&#x27;s household.

In the capital of Kosovo, hundreds of ethnically Albanian women threw smoke bombs at the headquarters of the police while protesting domestic violence.

In the Philippines, there was a rally in Manila at which protestors from different women&#x27;s groups gathered in Manila to protest for good jobs and better wages.

In Tanzania, there was an International Women&#x27;s Day rally arranged by an opposition party opposed to Samia Suluhu Hassan, the first female President of Tanzania; she stated, &quot;The opposition is lucky that it is a woman president in charge because if a misunderstanding occurs, I will stand for peace and make the men settle their egos&quot;.

In Turkey, a march was officially banned, but women still tried to protest in favor of women&#x27;s rights and against the suffering of many people due to an earthquake in Turkey that year, made worse by unsafe buildings. Police detained some people and used tear gas.

===2024===

The Fortieth Amendment of the Constitution (Care) Bill 2023 proposed to replace a reference to women&#x27;s &quot;life within the home&quot; and a constitutional obligation to &quot;endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home&quot; with a gender-neutral article on supporting care within the family. However, both referendums were defeated, so the constitution was not amended.

Six couples recognized International Women&#x27;s Day by suing the government of Japan for the right of a wife and husband to have different last names.

In Pakistan, there were rallies in major cities to bring attention to debt bondage, the scarcity of women in Parliament, and street harassment.

==Around the world==

IWD is an official holiday in many countries worldwide, including Afghanistan, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, China (for women only), Cuba, Georgia, Germany (Berlin and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania only), Guinea-Bissau, Eritrea, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Madagascar (for women only), Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nepal, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Zambia.

In some countries, such as Australia, Cameroon, Croatia, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Vietnam, Chile, and Ghana, IWD is not an official public holiday, but is widely observed, nonetheless.

Several countries, including Algeria, France, Italy, Spain, and Uruguay, have squares or other public spaces named after 8 March in reference to International Women&#x27;s Day.

Regardless of legal status, in much of the world, it is customary for women and men to give their female colleagues and loved ones flowers and gifts on the day. In some countries (such as Bulgaria and Romania) it is also observed as an equivalent of Mother&#x27;s Day, where children also give small presents to their mothers and grandmothers.

In the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, huge Soviet-style celebrations were held annually. After the fall of Communism, the holiday, generally considered to be one of the major symbols of the old regime, fell into obscurity. International Women&#x27;s Day was re-established as an official &quot;important day&quot; by the Parliament of the Czech Republic in 2004 on the proposal of the Social Democrats and Communists. This has provoked some controversy as a large part of the public as well as the political right see the holiday as a relic of the nation&#x27;s Communist past.

IWD is widely celebrated in France as the (literally &quot;International Women&#x27;s Day&quot;).

In Italy, the holiday is observed by men giving yellow mimosas to women. This originated with communist politician Teresa Mattei, who chose the mimosa in 1946 as the symbol of IWD at the request of Luigi Longo. Mattei felt that the French symbols of IWD, violets and lilies of the valley, were too scarce and expensive to be used in poor, rural Italian areas, so she proposed the mimosa as an alternative.

In the United States, since the 1980&#x27;s actress and human rights activist Beata Pozniak worked with the Mayor of Los Angeles and the Governor of California to lobby members of the US Congress and proposed the first official IWD bill in the history of US Congress. In 1994, per Pozniak&#x27;s suggestion H. J. Res. 316 bill was introduced by Representative Maxine Waters, to recognize March 8 as International Women&#x27;s Day.

In Pakistan, the first Aurat Marches were begun by women&#x27;s collectives in parallel with the Pakistani #MeToo movement on International Women&#x27;s Day. The first march was held on 8 March 2018 in Karachi. The Aurat March is now an annual socio-political demonstration in Pakistani cities such as Lahore, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Faisalabad, Multan, Quetta, Karachi, Islamabad and Peshawar to observe International Women&#x27;s Day.

International Women&#x27;s Day sparked violence in Tehran, Iran on March 4, 2007, when police beat hundreds of men and women who were planning a rally. A previous rally for the occasion was held in Tehran in 2003. Police arrested dozens of women, and some were released after several days of solitary confinement and interrogation. Shadi Sadr, Mahbubeh Abbasgholizadeh and several more community activists were released on March 19, 2007, ending a fifteen-day hunger strike.

<doc id="280753" wikidata="Q43961" url="?curid=280753" title="Hedwig of Saxony">
<text>Hedwig of Saxony (; – after 958-959) was a member of the Ottonian dynasty and wife of the Robertian duke Hugh the Great. Upon her husband&#x27;s death in 956, she ruled the Robertian estates as a regent during the minority of their son Hugh Capet, the founder of the Elder House of Capet.

==Life==
Hedwig was a younger daughter of the Saxon duke Henry the Fowler ( – 936), elected king of East Francia in 919, and his second wife, Matilda of Ringelheim ( – 968). Her siblings were Otto I, who succeeded his father as king and was crowned emperor in 962; Duke Henry I of Bavaria; Gerberga of Saxony, who married King Louis IV of France in 939; and Archbishop Bruno the Great of Cologne.

After her brother Otto I came to power in 936, an alliance and marriage was arranged with the West Frankish duke Hugh the Great, who sought support in his struggles with King Louis IV. Hedwig was Hugh&#x27;s third wife. They married probably in May 937.

When Hedwig&#x27;s husband died in 956, her son Hugh Capet was still underage. Although Hugh inherited his father&#x27;s estates, he did not rule independently from the beginning. Along with her brother, Archbishop Bruno, Hedwig acted as Hugh&#x27;s regent and administrator of the Robertian estates until he came of age. Bruno also held guardianship over his nephew King Lothair of France, son of his sister Gerberga, and temporarily raised to one of the most powerful nobles in West Francia. Hedwig backed her brother in his conflict with Count Reginar III of Hainaut and arbitrated in the rivalry between her son Hugh Capet and King Lothair.

Hedwig is last mentioned in 958 by the West Frankish chronicler Flodoard of Reims and may have died soon afterward; a 965 entry by Sigebert of Gembloux seems doubtful.

==Issue==
Hedwig had five children with her husband Hugh the Great:
*Beatrice of France married Frederick I, Duke of Upper Lorraine. 
*Hugh Capet (c. 941 – 996), who was crowned King of France in 987.
*Emma of Paris (943–968), who married Duke Richard I of Normandy in 960. 
*Otto, Duke of Burgundy (945–965).
*Henry I, Duke of Burgundy (946–1002).

<doc id="280761" wikidata="Q2005272" url="?curid=280761" title="Stonewall Book Award">
<text>The Stonewall Book Award is a set of three literary awards that annually recognize &quot;exceptional merit relating to the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender experience&quot; in English-language books published in the U.S. They are sponsored by the Rainbow Round Table (RRT) of the American Library Association (ALA) and have been part of the American Library Association awards program, now termed ALA Book, Print &amp; Media Awards, since 1986 as the single Gay Book Award.

The three award categories are fiction and nonfiction in books for adults, distinguished in 1990, and books for children or young adults, from 2010. The awards are named for Barbara Gittings, Israel Fishman, and (jointly) Mike Morgan and Larry Romans. In full they are the Stonewall Book Award-Barbara Gittings Literature Award, the Stonewall Book Award-Israel Fishman Non-Fiction Award, and the Stonewall Book Awards – Mike Morgan &amp; Larry Romans Children&#x27;s &amp; Young Adult Literature Award.

Finalists have been designated from 1990, and termed &quot;Honor Books&quot; from 2001. Currently a panel of librarians selects five finalists in each award category and subsequently selects one winner. The winners are announced in January and each receives a plaque and $1000 cash prize during the ALA Annual Conference in June or July. Winners are expected to attend and to give acceptance speeches.

The ALA solicits book suggestions each to be accompanied by a brief statement in favor of the book. Anyone may suggest a title for consideration. However, the publisher of a proposed title, agents or representatives of the author, or anyone else who may stand to gain directly from the nomination of the book should disclose this information via the online form.

Eligible books should be original works published in the U.S. and Canada during the preceding year, including &quot;substantially changed new editions&quot; and &quot;English-language translations of foreign-language books&quot;.

==History==
The Gay Book Award was inaugurated in 1971 at the ALA annual meeting in Dallas, by the newly created Task Force on Gay Liberation (TFGL) The ceremony, attended by only 9 people, recognized &quot;Patience and Sarah&quot;, a historical novel by Alma Routsong (writing as Isabel Miller), which had been self-published by Routsong in 1969. A &quot;grassroots acknowledgment&quot; of GLBT publishing, there were &quot;only a handful&quot; of books to consider annually. The ALA officially started granting the award in 1986, and by 1995, there were more than 800 books considered for the award.

In 2002, the awards, then two, were jointly named after the site of the 1969 Stonewall riots as well as two of the founding members of the TFGL, Barbara Gittings and Israel Fishman.

<doc id="280762" wikidata="Q1050800" url="?curid=280762" title="Helpmate">
<text>A helpmate is a type of chess problem in which both sides cooperate in order to achieve the goal of checkmating Black. In a helpmate in &quot;n&quot; moves, Black moves first, then White, each side moving &quot;n&quot; times, to culminate in White&#x27;s &quot;nth&quot; move checkmating Black. (In a helpmate in 2 for example, sometimes abbreviated &quot;h#2&quot;, the solution consists of a Black move, a White move, a second Black move, then a second White move, giving checkmate.) Although the two sides cooperate, all moves must be legal according to the rules of chess.

The example problem illustrated is a helpmate in 8 (or &quot;h#8&quot;) by Zdravko Maslar, published in &quot;Die Schwalbe&quot; in 1981. The solution is (&quot;recall that in helpmate solutions, Black&#x27;s move is given first&quot;):
:1. Kf3 Kd3 2. Bb3 Kc3 3. Ke4+ Kd2 4. Kd4 Ke2 5. Kc3 Sb4 6. Kb2 Kd2 7. Ka1 Kc1 8. Ba2 Nc2
== History ==
The first helpmate problem was by the German chess master Max Lange, published in &quot;Deutsche Schachzeitung&quot;, December 1854. The problem had White to move and White could play in a number of different ways to achieve the same mate (&quot;&quot;), considered a serious flaw today.

In &quot;The Chess Monthly&quot;, November 1860, American puzzle inventor Sam Loyd published the first helpmate with Black to move as is now standard, one intended main line, and an attractive but false solution (a &#x27;) to mislead solvers. However, this problem too had a minor dual, and also had the major flaw (or &#x27;) of having a second, completely separate solution, not noted by the author. Even so, it was a much better problem than Lange&#x27;s and its presentation, incorporating a story written by D. W. Fiske, established the genre.

The first completely sound helpmate was by A. Barbe of Leipzig, published in &quot;105 Leipziger Ill. Familien-Journal&quot;, 1861.

The term &quot;help-mate&quot; originated in &quot;The Problem Art&quot; by T. B. and F. F. Rowland (Kingstown, 1897). The helpmate problem task has since increased in popularity to be second only to the directmate and is no longer considered to be part of fairy chess.
== Varieties of helpmate problems ==

=== Multiple solutions ===

Because the nature of helpmates sees Black and White cooperating, the play in helpmates may seem to be a great deal simpler than in directmates (the most common type of problem, where White tries to checkmate Black, and Black tries to avoid being mated). In directmates, a great variety of play can be found in the solution because although White has only one move at each juncture which will solve the problem, Black can choose between several to try to thwart White&#x27;s efforts. In helpmates, however, both White&#x27;s and Black&#x27;s moves are limited to just one at each juncture; this may seem simple, but a well-constructed helpmate also shows thematic play, and the cooperating moves should not always be easy to find. It has been noted by Jean Oudot that &quot;helpmates are the purest form of all the chess arts&quot;.

In order to introduce more lines of play into a problem, various devices can be employed. Most straightforwardly, a problem can have more than one solution. The solutions will usually complement each other in some thematic and aesthetically pleasing way. Each solution can be considered a different phase of play. If there is more than one solution, the composer will state this; if there is no such statement, the problem has only one solution. The example to the right is a helpmate in 2 (h#2) with two solutions. It was published in the June 1975 issue of &quot;Schach&quot; and is by the helpmate specialist Chris J. Feather.

The two solutions are 1. Bxb8 Bd5 2. Nc7 Bxg5# and 1. Rdxd8 Bc6 2. Nd7 Rxb3#. These lines are very closely linked, with both exhibiting the same basic pattern: first, Black takes the white piece that gives mate in the other solution (this is known as a Zilahi), at the same time opening the line on which mate is eventually given, then White moves a bishop to close a line so that Black&#x27;s next move will not give check. Black&#x27;s second move closes another line so that after White&#x27;s last move, giving check, Black will not be able to interpose one of his pieces.

=== Twinning ===

Another way of giving variety to the play of a helpmate is &quot;twinning&quot;. Here, more than one problem is wrought from a single diagram by making small changes to it, such as moving a piece from one square to another, adding or removing a piece, turning the board round or some other device. Twinning is occasionally found in other types of problems, but is particularly common in helpmates. The example shown is a helpmate in 2 by Henry Forsberg (published in 1935 in &quot;Revista Romana de Şah&quot;). The twins are created by substituting the black queen on a6 with a different piece. The solutions are:

:a) diagram position: 1. Qf6 Nc5 2. Qb2 Ra4#
:b) with black rook at a6: 1. Rb6 Rb1 2. Rb3 Ra1#
:c) with black bishop at a6: 1. Bc4 Ne1 2. Ba2 Nc2#
:d) with black knight at a6: 1. Nc5 Nc1 2. Na4 Rb3#
:e) with black pawn at a6: 1. a5 Rb3+ 2. Ka4 Nc5#
=== Duplex ===

A further variation is the &quot;duplex&quot;, another way of getting two problems for the price of one. The first problem is a normal helpmate; the second starts from the same position but has White moving first and helping Black to checkmate him. Again, duplex problems have been composed with other types of problems, but the vast majority are helpmates. To the right is an example by Milan Vukcevich (from &quot;CHM avec 6 pieces Bad Pyrmont&quot;, 1996).

The solution with Black moving first is 1. Ng6 f8=Q 2. Ne5 d8=N#. With White moving first, it is 1. f8=R Nf7 2. d8=B Nd6#. These two lines are closely linked, with two white pawn promotions covering the black king&#x27;s flight squares in the first part and promoted pieces blocking White&#x27;s flight squares in the second. This problem is an Allumwandlung, a problem in which pawns are promoted to each of knight, bishop, rook and queen.

=== Unorthodox helpmate problems ===
Very popular today also are helpmates where White moves first; then the stipulation contains a &quot;½&quot;, for example a helpmate in 2½ moves. Helpmates, like other problems, can be composed with fairy chess pieces or with fairy conditions (chess variant rules), such as Circe chess, Grid chess, or Patrol chess. All of these variations can be, and have been, combined. (So it is possible to have, for instance, a series-helpmate in 7, twinned with two solutions in each phase, using nightriders and Madrasi chess.) Problems related to helpmates can have other kinds of stipulations involving cooperation between White and Black, in particular seriesmover problems, like seriesmates, serieshelpmates, serieshelpstalemates, etc.

<text>The Bolivarian Revolution is a social revolution and ongoing political process in Venezuela that was started by Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, the founder of the Fifth Republic Movement and later the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), and his successor Nicolás Maduro. The Bolivarian Revolution is named after Simón Bolívar, an early 19th-century Venezuelan revolutionary leader, prominent in the Spanish American wars of independence in achieving the independence of most of northern South America from Spanish rule. According to Chávez and supporters, the Bolivarian Revolution seeks to build an inter-American coalition to implement Bolivarianism, nationalism and a state-led economy.

On his 57th birthday, while announcing that he was being treated for cancer, Chávez announced that he had changed the slogan of the Bolivarian Revolution from &quot;Motherland, socialism, or death&quot; to &quot;Motherland and socialism. We will live, and we will come out victorious.&quot;

As of 2018, the vast majority of mayoral and gubernatorial offices are held by PSUV candidates, while the opposition Democratic Unity (MUD) coalition won two thirds of parliamentary seats in 2015. Political hostility between the PSUV and MUD have led to several incidents where both pro-government and opposition demonstrations have turned violent, with an estimated 150 dead as a result in 2017. Several opposition figures have been subject to politically motivated detentions.

Following the death of Chávez in 2013, the revolution has gone into social decline and the political and economic situation in Venezuela has rapidly deteriorated.

== Background ==
Simón Bolívar has left a long lasting imprint on Venezuela&#x27;s history in particular and South America in general.

As a military cadet, Hugo Chávez was &quot;a celebrant of the Bolivarian passion story&quot;. Chávez relied upon the ideas of Bolívar and on Bolívar as a popular symbol later in his military career as he put together his MBR-200 movement which would become a vehicle for his 1992 coup-attempt. A fall in oil prices in the mid-1980s caused an economic crisis to take hold in Venezuela, and the country had accrued significant levels of debt. Nevertheless, the administration of the left-leaning President Jaime Lusinchi was able to restructure the country&#x27;s debt repayments and offset an economic crisis but allow for the continuation of the government&#x27;s policies of social spending and state-sponsored subsidies. Lusinchi&#x27;s political party, the Democratic Action, was able to remain in power following the 1988 election of Carlos Andrés Pérez as president.

Pérez proposed a major shift in policy by implementing economic reforms recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Measures taken by Pérez included privatizing state companies, tax reform, reducing customs duties, and diminishing the role of the state in the economy. He also took measures to decentralize and modernize the Venezuelan political system by the direct election of state governors, who had previously been appointed by the president. The most controversial part of the economic reform package was the reduction of the gasoline subsidies, which had long maintained domestic gasoline prices far beneath international levels and even the production costs. In response to the government&#x27;s economic reforms and the resulting increase in the price of gasoline and transportation, a wave of protests and riots known as El Caracazo started on 27 February 1989 in Guarenas, spreading to Caracas and surrounding towns. The weeklong clashes resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people, mostly at the hands of security forces and the military.

Chávez and his Fifth Republic Movement party won the 1998 elections and initiated the constituent process that resulted in the Venezuelan Constitution of 1999.

== Policies ==
=== Domestic ===
&quot;Chavismo&quot; policies include nationalization, social welfare programs (Bolivarian missions) and opposition to liberalization reforms (particularly the policies of the IMF and the World Bank). According to Hugo Chávez, Venezuelan socialism accepts private property, but this socialism seeks to promote social property too. In January 2007, Chávez proposed to build the communal state, whose main idea is to build self-government institutions like communal councils, communes and communal cities.

=== International ===
According to the United States Army Combined Arms Center: A few year after Chávez rose to power in 1999, he began implementing a political-strategic plan he called the &#x27;Bolivarian Revolution,&#x27; which threatened North American rule by promising a Latin American liberation from the Monroe doctrine. Chávez&#x27;s plan was characterized by a hostile and confrontational posture toward the United States, actions designed to export Chávez&#x27;s autocratic, socialist model to other countries of the region, and a foreign policy that embroiled Venezuela in international-level conflicts.

Chávez was seen as a leader of the &quot;pink tide&quot;, a turn towards left-wing governments in Latin American democracies. Analysts have pointed out additional anti-American, populist and authoritarian-leaning traits in those governments.

Chávez refocused Venezuelan foreign policy on Latin American economic and social integration by enacting bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements, including his so-called &quot;oil diplomacy&quot;, making Venezuela more dependent on using oil (its main commodity) and increasing its longterm vulnerability. Though Chávez inspired other movements in Latin America to follow his model of &quot;chavismo&quot; in an attempt to reshape South America, it was later seen as being erratic and his influence internationally became exaggerated, with the pink tide beginning to subside in 2009.

== Bolivarian missions ==
The social programs (called &quot;missions&quot; in Venezuela) that came into being during the term of Hugo Chávez sought to reduce social disparities and were funded in large part by oil revenues. The sustainability and design of the welfare programs have been both praised and criticized. Specific examples of social programs are listed below.

=== Plan Bolívar 2000 ===

Plan Bolívar 2000 was the first of the Bolivarian Missions enacted under of administration of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. According to the United States Department of State, Chávez wanted to &quot;send the message that the military was not a force of popular repression, but rather a force for development and security&quot;. The United States State Department also commented that this happened &quot;only 23 days after his inauguration&quot; and that he wanted to show his closest supporters &quot;that he had not forgotten them&quot;. Several scandals affected the program as allegations of corruption were formulated against Generals involved in the plan, arguing that significant amounts of money had been diverted.

=== Mission Barrio Adentro ===

The mission was to provide comprehensive publicly funded health care, dental care and sports training to poor and marginalized communities in Venezuela. &quot;Barrio Adentro&quot; featured the construction of thousands of iconic two-story medical clinics—&quot;consultorios&quot; or doctor&#x27;s offices—as well as staffing with resident certified medical professionals. &quot;Barrio Adentro&quot; constitutes an attempt to deliver a &quot;de facto&quot; form of universal health care, seeking to guarantee access to quality and cradle-to-grave medical attention for all Venezuelan citizens. As of 2006, the staff included 31,439 professionals, technical personnel, and health technicians, of which 15,356 were Cuban doctors and 1,234 Venezuelan doctors. The Latin American branch of the World Health Organization and UNICEF both praised the program. Although positive outcomes have come from the mission, there have been some struggles as well. In July 2007, Douglas León Natera, chairman of the Venezuelan Medical Federation, reported that up to 70% of the modules of Barrio Adentro were either abandoned or were left unfinished. In 2014, residents in Caracas also complained of the service despite large funding from the Venezuelan government.

=== Mission Habitat ===

Mission Habitat&#x27;s goal is the construction of thousands of new housing units for the poor. The program also seeks to develop agreeable and integrated housing zones that make available a full range of social services—from education to healthcare—which likens its vision to that of New Urbanism. According to Venezuela&#x27;s &quot;El Universal&quot;, one of the Chávez administration&#x27;s outstanding weaknesses is the failure to meet its goals of construction of housing. Chávez promised to build 150,000 houses in 2006, but in the first half of the year completed only 24 percent of that target, with 35,000 houses.

=== Mission Mercal ===

The Mission involves a state-run company called Mercados de Alimentos, C.A. (MERCAL), which provides subsidised food and basic goods through a nationwide chain of stores. In 2010 Mercal was reported as having 16,600 outlets, &quot;ranging from street-corner shops to huge warehouse stores&quot;, in addition to 6,000 soup kitchens. Mercal employs 85,000 workers. In 2006, some 11.36 million Venezuelans benefited from Mercal food programs on a regular basis. At least 14,208 Mission Mercal food distribution sites were spread throughout Venezuela and 4,543 metric tons of food distributed each day. In recent times, customers who had to wait in long lines for discounted products say that there were a lack of products in Mercal stores and that items available at the stores change constantly. Some customers complained about rationing being enforced at Mercal stores due to the lack of products. In some cases, protests have occurred due to the shortages in stores.

=== Mission Robinson ===

The program uses volunteers to teach reading, writing and arithmetic to the more than 1.5 million Venezuelan adults who were illiterate prior to Chávez&#x27;s election to the presidency in 1999. The program is military-civilian in nature and sends soldiers to—among other places—remote and dangerous locales in order to reach the most undereducated, neglected and marginalized adult citizens to give them regular schooling and lessons. On 28 October 2005, Venezuela declared itself a &quot;Territory Free of Illiteracy&quot;, having raised in its initial estimates the literacy rate to around 99%, although the statistic was changed to 96%. According to UNESCO standards, a country can be declared &quot;illiteracy-free&quot; if 96% of its population over age 15 can read and write.

According to Francisco Rodríguez and Daniel Ortega of IESA, there has been &quot;little evidence&quot; of &quot;statistically distinguishable effect on Venezuelan illiteracy&quot;. The Venezuelan government claimed that it had taught 1.5 million Venezuelans to read, but the study found that &quot;only 1.1m were illiterate to begin with&quot; and that the illiteracy reduction of less than 100,000 can be attributed to adults that were elderly and died. David Rosnick and Mark Weisbrot of the Center for Economic and Policy Research responded to these doubts, finding that the data used by Rodríguez and Ortega was too crude a measure since the Household Survey from which it derived was never designed to measure literacy or reading skills and their methods were inappropriate to provide statistical evidence regarding the size of Venezuela&#x27;s national literacy program. Rodríguez responded to Weisbrot&#x27;s rebuttal by showing that Weisbrot used biased, distorted data and that the illiteracy argument Weisbrot used showed the exact opposite of what Weisbrot was attempting to convey.

== Decline ==

Following the death of Hugo Chávez, his successor Nicolás Maduro faced the consequences of Chávez&#x27;s policies, with Maduro&#x27;s approval declining and protests in Venezuela beginning in 2014. The Chávez and Maduro administrations often blamed difficulties that Venezuela faced on foreign intervention in the country&#x27;s affairs.

As of 2016, Bolivarian Venezuela suffered from hyperinflation and a dramatic loss of jobs and income (consumer prices rose 800% and the economy contracted by 19% during 2016), widespread hunger (the &quot;Venezuela&#x27;s Living Conditions Survey&quot; (ENCOVI) found nearly 75% of the population had lost an average of at least 8.7 kg in weight due to a lack of proper nutrition) and a soaring murder rate (90 people per 100,000 had been murdered in Venezuela in 2015 compared to 5 per 100,000 in the United States according to the Observatory of Venezuelan Violence).

According to Human Rights Watch To silence critics, the government has conducted widespread arrests and other repression. Since 2014, we have been documenting the violent response of security forces to protests, with beatings and arrests of peaceful demonstrators and even bystanders and torture in detention. The Venezuelan Penal Forum, a nongovernmental group that provides legal assistance to detainees, counts more than 90 people it considers political prisoners.According to the &quot;International Policy Digest&quot;, &quot;[t]he Bolivarian revolution is a failure not because its ideals were unachievable but because its leaders were as corrupt as those they decry&quot;, with the Bolivarian government relying on oil for its economy, essentially suffering from Dutch disease. As a result of the Bolivarian government&#x27;s policies, Venezuelans suffered from shortages, inflation, crime and other socioeconomic issues, with many Venezuelans resorting to leave their native country to seek a better life elsewhere.

=== Venezuelan refugee crisis ===

Following the Bolivarian Revolution, initially many wealthy Venezuelans sought residence in other countries. According to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, the &quot;Bolivarian diaspora is a reversal of fortune on a massive scale&quot; where the reversal is a comparison to when in the 20th century &quot;Venezuela was a haven for immigrants fleeing Old World repression and intolerance&quot;. &quot;El Universal&quot; explains how the Venezuelan migrant crisis in Venezuela has been caused by the &quot;deterioration of both the economy and the social fabric, rampant crime, uncertainty and lack of hope for a change in leadership in the near future.&quot;

In 1998, the year Chavez was first elected, only 14 Venezuelans were granted asylum in the United States. In just twelve months in September 1999, 1,086 Venezuelans were granted asylum according to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. It has been calculated that from 1998 to 2013 over 1.5 million Venezuelans, between 4% and 6% of the Venezuela&#x27;s total population, left the country following the Bolivarian Revolution. Many of former Venezuelan citizens studied gave reasons for leaving Venezuela that included lacking of freedom, high levels of insecurity and lacking opportunity in the country. It has also been stated that some parents in Venezuela encourage their children to leave the country in protection of their children due to the insecurities Venezuelans face. This has led to human capital flight occurring in Venezuela. 

In November 2018, UNHCR (the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) and the IOM (International Organization for Migration) said the number of refugees had risen to 3 million, most of which had gone to other Latin American countries and the Caribbean.

== Impact on other countries ==
Bolivarianism was emulated in Bolivia and Ecuador, which experienced crises of political parties. According to a 2017 study, Bolivarianism failed to spread further through Latin America and the Caribbean &quot;in nations where political parties and democratic institutions remained functioning, and where the left and civil society valued democracy, pluralism, and liberal rights due to brutal autocratic experiences&quot;. The study also found that &quot;the fear of Bolivarianism also led to a coup against president Zelaya in Honduras&quot;.

Aspects of Bolivarianism were adopted by the Spanish political party Podemos.

<text>Studland is a village and civil parish on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset, England. The village is located about north of the town of Swanage, over a steep chalk ridge, and south of the South East Dorset conurbation at Sandbanks, from which it is separated by Poole Harbour. The parish includes Brownsea Island within the harbour. In the 2011 census the parish had 182 households and a population of 425, though many of the houses in the village are holiday homes, second homes, or guest houses, and the village&#x27;s population varies depending upon the season.

Studland is famous for its beaches and nature reserve.

== Description ==

Studland is sited in the lee of Ballard Down, close to the east-facing Studland Bay, a long curved sweep of sandy beaches backed by dunes and heathland. The beaches are named South Beach, Middle Beach and Knoll Beach, with another at Shell Bay to the north.

Although a coastal village, the houses in Studland are mostly sited a few hundred metres inland. At the start of the twentieth century Sir Frederick Treves described the village as &quot;a medley of country lanes, lost among trees, with a few thatch-roofed cottages dotted about in a wild garden of brambles, ferns, and gorse&quot;. He noted that Studland had &quot;no pretence to a quay&quot;, but rather &quot;turns its face from the sea to bury it among its myrtles and fuchsia bushes&quot;. He lamented the arrival of tourists and the construction of villas in the village however, commenting that &quot;The red brick epidemic ... has seized upon it mercilessly.&quot;

Since Treves&#x27; time the village has expanded with more buildings filling in gaps along its streets, much of the construction taking place in the early and mid 20th century, plus some more recently. Few ancient buildings remain in the village today, with the notable exception of the parish church, which is largely unaltered from Norman times, construction dating probably from around 1180. Close to the church is a modern Celtic cross, which was erected in 1976 and uses the old Saxon cross foundation as its base.

== Geography ==

=== Studland Bay and beach management ===

Studland Bay is protected from the prevailing southwesterly winds and storms by Ballard Down and Handfast Point, the chalk headland that separates Studland from Swanage Bay to the south. In the 17th century there began a process of sand accumulation in the bay and along the South Haven Peninsula stretching north, resulting in natural land reclamation and the creation or expansion of the bay&#x27;s beaches and its psammosere (sand dune system).

The beaches at Studland Bay are amongst the most popular in the country, and on hot summer weekends they fill up with thousands of people. The South East Dorset Conurbation lies on the other side of Poole Harbour, resulting in the beaches being relatively accessible to a large population. North of the visitor centre the beach and dunes are owned and managed by the National Trust, who have restricted parking provision at the site to prevent overcrowding. A short northern stretch of beach is reserved as a naturist beach.

Since the early 20th century the supply of sand to the bay has depleted and erosion is occurring so that, if natural processes are uninterrupted, the coastline may in time retreat back to its previous line, visible as a line of higher ground between Redend Point and the hill east of the Knoll House Hotel. In January 2004 the BBC television series &quot;The National Trust&quot; investigated the conflicts between different groups of people who use the beach and heath at Studland. The series particularly covered the debate about coastal management, with the Trust proposing to remove defensive walls to allow natural processes to shape the coastline, though this would result in loss of some land and property.

The final stage of the South West Coast Path (if walked in the conventional anti-clockwise direction, starting at Minehead, Somerset) follows Studland Bay and ends at South Haven Point, where a sculpture marks the end.

=== Heathland and nature reserve ===

Behind the sand dunes there is a large area of heathland, named Studland Heath to the north of the village and Godlingston Heath to the west. This area is also owned and managed by the National Trust. Within Studland Heath is an acidic freshwater lake called Little Sea, which was cut off from the sea by the development of the dunes, and is a haven for birds and other wildlife. Studland and Godlingston Heath NNR has been a national nature reserve since 1946, and the site is on English Nature&#x27;s list of &quot;Spotlight Reserves&quot;, the 31 most important reserves in England. The site is also a protected Site of Special Scientific Interest, and is within the Dorset National Landscape area, part of the Purbeck Heritage Coast, and a gateway to the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site.

Standing on a mound on Godlingston Heath is the high Agglestone Rock, estimated to weigh . The rock is also known as the Devil&#x27;s Anvil, and local myth states that the devil threw it there from The Needles on the Isle of Wight, reputedly aiming for Corfe Castle, Bindon Abbey, Stonehenge or Salisbury Cathedral. In truth, it is more than likely part of a band of rocks that ran across the whole of Godlingston Heath. The sandy earth was eroded around the firmer rock and left it standing proud. &quot;Aggle&quot; was taken into the old Dorset dialect as meaning &quot;to wobble&quot;. In September 1970 the rock fell to one side, resulting in it losing its distinctive inverted-cone &#x27;anvil&#x27; appearance. Other lumps in the landscape can be seen across the heath, including the Puckstone which, in years to come, may be another standing rock similar to the Agglestone.

=== Oilfield ===

The heath and harbour are home to Britain&#x27;s largest onshore oil field, and Perenco&#x27;s Wytch Farm gathering station is hidden amongst a pine forest to the west of the heath.

== History ==

The existence of salt pans and salt workers at Studland is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. St Nicholas&#x27; Church, dedicated to the patron saint of sailors, is built on the site of an earlier Saxon building which was destroyed by the Danes in the 9th century, and had itself been constructed on an earlier, possibly pre-Christian foundation. Records from 1340 show that fishing was an important industry in Studland in the 14th century. In 1381 records show a castle existed on the cliffs at Handfast Point to the east of the village. By the 16th century this had been replaced with another castle, which existed until at least the 18th century when a blockhouse was added to it. Today nothing remains as the buildings were lost into the sea as a result of coastal erosion of the cliffs. The Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck stationed a lifeboat at Studland in 1826, but it was withdrawn in 1848.

=== World War II ===

In 1940, the coastline at Studland Bay was one of the two stretches of Dorset coast where a German invasion was considered most likely and it was fortified as a part of British anti-invasion preparations of World War II. In 1942 the hamlet of Goathorn was evacuated and the area taken over by the military. The hamlet was subsequently lost to heathland but the pier, which once boasted a tramway, remains.

The village and beach were used as a training area before the D-Day landing in the Second World War. On top of Redend Point, a small sandstone cliff which splits the beach in two at high tide, is Fort Henry. Built in 1943 by Canadian engineers, it is long, with walls and an recessed observation slit. Seven Valentine tanks fitted with duplex drive equipment sank in the bay during Exercise Smash in April 1944, resulting in the death of six soldiers. On 18 April 1944, King George VI, General Sir Bernard Montgomery and General Dwight D. Eisenhower, met here (at the Knoll House Hotel) to observe the training troops and discuss the plans for the coming battle.

== Ecology ==

The Studland and Godlingston Heath National Nature Reserve has a variety of habitats including heathland, bogs, woodland, alder and willow carr, sand dunes, scrub and freshwater, which support a variety of wildlife including large populations of wildfowl and insects. Studland Bay is particularly good for sighting rarer grebes and divers in winter, with up to 20 black-necked grebe and 5 great northern diver recorded. The Studland Peninsula is one of the best places to see Dartford warbler in the UK with around 130 pairs nesting on the heath; this is about 7% of the UK population. The nature reserve is one of only a few places (mostly in Dorset) in Britain which is home to all six native reptile species.

Two species of seahorse (the spiny seahorse, &quot;Hippocampus guttulatus&quot; and the short-snouted seahorse, &quot;Hippocampus hippocampus&quot;) have been discovered in Studland Bay, specifically a seagrass meadow at the southern end of the beach. Anecdotal evidence from residents reported in the Studland Parish Magazine indicates that both types of seahorse have been found in the bay since at least the 1970s, possibly encouraged by the reputed growth in the seagrass beds.

Embryo sand dunes are bound together by colonies of salt-resistant couch grass (&quot;Elymus repens&quot;) and lyme-grass (&quot;Leymus arenarius&quot;), which permit the gradual expansion of the dune until long-rooted marram grass (&quot;Ammophila&quot; (Poaceae)) can establish itself once the sand reaches approximately a metre in height.
Moving away from the shoreline, beyond the embryo dunes are found a ridge of &quot;mobile dunes&quot; which may have been in situ for over 50 years; &quot;semi-fixed&quot; dunes bound with grasses, mosses and wild flowers; and &quot;fixed dunes&quot; capable of supporting bracken and saplings.

Nutrient-poor acidic bogs occur within the vicinity of the Agglestone in particular, a result of a lack of carbonate in the rock strata and pockets of clay trapping surface water. These bogs support specialised plant species such as insectivorous sundews.

== Politics ==
Studland is covered by the South Dorset constituency.

After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Studland is part of the South East Purbeck ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

== Studland in popular culture ==

* Egdon Heath, which figures prominently in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s celebrated novel &quot;The Return of the Native&quot;, is a fictionalised version of the Poole basin heaths, most prominently the current Black Heath, Duddle Heath and Puddletown Heath around his birthplace, but including elements from Studland and Godlingston heaths.
* Mr Plod the Toyland policeman in Enid Blyton&#x27;s Noddy stories is reportedly based on PC Christopher Rhone, a Studland police constable.
* The beach, with Bournemouth in the background, was the setting of the opening scene from the first episode of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; with Michael Palin staggering out of the shallow sea and collapsing on the beach before saying &quot;It&#x27;s...&quot;
* The video for the Coldplay single &quot;Yellow&quot; was filmed on the beach.
* The beach scene set in Spain in the Only Fools and Horses episode &quot;It Never Rains...&quot; was filmed on Studland beach.

<doc id="280781" wikidata="Q7628328" url="?curid=280781" title="Studland and Godlingston Heath National Nature Reserve">
<text>The Studland and Godlingston Heaths NNR is located on the Isle of Purbeck in the English county of Dorset. It borders Studland Bay on the south side of Poole Harbour, between the settlements of Swanage and Sandbanks. Extending to 631ha, it is owned and managed by the National Trust following the Bankes bequest of the Kingston Lacy estate. Studland &amp; Godlingston Heath is designated as one of only 35 &quot;spotlight reserves&quot; in England by Natural England in the list of national nature reserves in England and is listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

==International importance==
The reserve predominantly consists of internationally important lowland heath but also has a wide range of habitats including sand dune, peat bog, alder and willow carr, freshwater lagoons such as the &quot;Little Sea&quot;, and 5 km of sandy beach. All six species of native British reptiles are found here including the rare and nationally endangered sand lizard and smooth snake.

The reserve is a notable stronghold of the rare Dartford warbler which successfully survived in this corner of Dorset when nearly wiped out elsewhere in southern England by prolonged periods of extreme winter cold.

==Ancient history==
The reserve features many prehistoric remains of man&#x27;s activity in the area pre-dating Roman times, indicated on the OS maps as Tumulus. The reserve also contains the mysterious standing stone known as the Agglestone Rock.

==Fire risk==
The reserve is notoriously prone to catching fire during hot, dry spells in summer, and large areas have been successively devastated and regenerated in the past.
The area was also used in the run-up to D-Day as a training area for the assault troops and as a bombing and strafing range by the Royal Air Force.

==Access==
The reserve is open to visitors all the year round. By road the reserve can be reached either via the Sandbanks Ferry from Poole and Bournemouth to the north, or via the A351 and B3351 roads from Wareham to the west. There is a mainline rail service by South Western Railway to Wareham station, and during the summer the Swanage Railway steam rail service operates from Wareham to Swanage via Corfe Castle. Local bus services on the Wareham - Swanage - South Haven Point circuit are provided by Wilts &amp; Dorset. There is accommodation and other visitor facilities in Studland village on the edge of the reserve.

==Other nature reserves on the Purbeck Peninsula==
Natural England has its local base at Slepe Farm near Wareham, and from there also administers the Stoborough Heath NNR and the adjacent Hartland Moor NNR.

The RSPB owns and manages a large nature reserve at Arne and the Dorset Wildlife Trust has two reserves at East Creech and also manages the unique Purbeck Marine Wildlife Reserve at Kimmeridge. The National Trust also owns the great chalk grassland ridge of Ballard Down to the south of Studland, and manages it as a nature reserve.

<text>Jean François Sarrazin (; c. 1611 – 5 December 1654), or Sarasin, was a French writer.

==Biography==
Sarrazin was born at Hermanville, near Caen, the son of Roger Sarasin, treasurer-general at Caen.

He was educated at Caen, and later settled in Paris. As a writer of &quot;vers de société&quot; he rivalled Voiture, but he was never admitted to the inner circle of the hôtel de Rambouillet. He was on terms of intimate friendship with Scarron, with whom he exchanged verses, with Ménage, and with Pellisson. In 1639 he supported Georges de Scudéry in his attack on Corneille with a &quot;Discours de la tragédie&quot;. He accompanied Léon Bouthillier, comte de Chavigny, secretary of state for foreign affairs, on various diplomatic errands. He was to have been sent on an embassy to Rome, but spent the money allotted for the purpose in Paris. This weakened his position with Chavigny, from whom he parted in the winter of 1643–1644.

To restore his fallen fortunes he married a rich widow, but the alliance was of short duration. He joined in the pamphlet war against Pierre de Montmaur, against whom he directed his satire, &quot;Bellum parasiticum&quot; (1644). He was accused of writing satires on Mazarin, and for a short time gave up the practice of verse. In 1648, supported by the cardinal de Retz and Madame de Longueville, he entered the household of Armand de Bourbon, prince de Conti, whose marriage with Mazarin&#x27;s niece he helped to negotiate. He died of fever at Pézenas, in Languedoc on 5 December 1654.

His biographers have variously stated on inadequate evidence that his death was caused by the prince de Conti in a moment of passion, or that he was poisoned by a jealous husband. The most considerable of his poems were the epic fragments of &quot;Rollon conquérant, la guerre espagnole&quot;, with &quot;Dulot vaincu&quot; and the &quot;Pompe funèbre&quot; in honour of Voiture. As a poet he was overrated, but he was the author of two excellent pieces of prose narration, the &quot;Histoire du siége de Dunkerque&quot; (1649) and the unfinished &quot;Conspiration de Walstein&quot; (1651). The &quot;Walstein&quot; has been compared for elegance and simplicity of style to Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Charles XII&quot;.

His &quot;Œuvres&quot; appeared in 1656, &quot;Nouvelles Œuvres&quot; (2 vols.) in 1674. His &quot;Poésies&quot; were edited in 1877 by Octave Uzanne with an introductory note. Much of his correspondence is preserved in the library of the Arsenal, Paris. See Albert Mennung&#x27;s &quot;Jean François Sarasins Leben und Werke&quot; (2 vols., Halle, 1902–1904).

<doc id="280800" wikidata="Q935857" url="?curid=280800" title="Hungarian alphabet">
<text>The Hungarian alphabet (, ) is an extension of the Latin alphabet used for writing the Hungarian language.

The alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet, with several added variations of letters, consisting 44 letters. Over the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet it has five letters with an acute accent, two letters with an umlaut, two letters with a double acute accent, eight letters made up of two characters, and one letter made up of three characters. In some other languages, characters with diacritical marks would be considered variations of the base letter, however in Hungarian, these characters are considered letters in their own right.

One sometimes speaks of the &quot;smaller&quot; (or basic) and &quot;greater&quot; (or &quot;extended&quot;) Hungarian alphabets, differing by the inclusion or exclusion of the letters &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, which can only be found in foreign words and traditional orthography of names. (As for Y, however, it exists as part of four digraphs.)

As an auxiliary letter sometimes Ë is used in academic documents to show different pronunciation of spoken dialects, though it is not part of the alphabet.

== Description ==
Each sign shown above counts as a letter in its own right in Hungarian. Some, such as the letter ⟨ó⟩ and ⟨ő⟩, are inter-filed with the letter preceding it when sorting words alphabetically, whereas others, such as ⟨ö⟩, have their own place in collation rather than also being inter-filed with ⟨o⟩.

While long vowels count as different letters, long (or geminate) consonants do not. Long consonants are marked by duplication: e.g. ⟨tt⟩, ⟨gg⟩, ⟨zz⟩ (&quot;ette&quot; &#x27;he ate&#x27; (det.obj.), &#x27;it hangs&#x27;, &#x27;with that&#x27;). For the di- and tri-graphs a simplification rule normally applies (but not when the compound is split at the end of a line of text due to hyphenation), only the first letter being duplicated, e.g.
:⟨sz⟩ + ⟨sz⟩ → ⟨ssz⟩ ( &#x27;woman&#x27;), 
:⟨ty⟩ + ⟨ty⟩ → ⟨tty⟩ ( &#x27;swan&#x27;),
:⟨dzs⟩ + ⟨dzs⟩ → ⟨⟩ ( &#x27;with bridge (playing game)&#x27;). 

An exception is made at the joining points of compound words, for example: &quot;jegygyűrű&quot; &#x27;engagement ring&#x27; ( + ) rather than .

Hyphenation of individual letters ⟨Dz⟩ and ⟨dzs⟩ were changed in the 11th edition of Hungarian orthography (1984). Prior to that, they were allowed to separate as two-letter combinations ⟨d⟩+⟨z⟩ and ⟨d⟩+⟨zs⟩.

== Pronunciation ==
The pronunciation given for the following Hungarian letters is that of &quot;standard Hungarian&quot;.
The letter &quot;ë&quot; is not part of the Hungarian alphabet; however, linguists use this letter to distinguish between the two kinds of short &quot;e&quot; sounds of some dialects. This letter was first used in 1770 by György Kalmár, but has never officially been part of the Hungarian alphabet, as the standard Hungarian language does not distinguish between these two sounds. However, the &quot;ë&quot; sound is pronounced differently from the &quot;e&quot; sound in 6 out of the 10 Hungarian dialects and the sound is pronounced as &quot;ö&quot; in 1 dialect. It is also used in names. Other letter for this sound is &quot;Ėė&quot; (rarely).

A more open variety of , close to , may be denoted as &quot;Ää&quot; in the Hungarian linguistics literature.

The digraph &quot;ch&quot; also exists in some words (&quot;technika&quot;, &quot;monarchia&quot;) and is pronounced the same as &quot;h&quot;. In names, however, it is pronounced like &quot;cs&quot; as well as like &quot;h&quot; or &quot;k&quot; (as in German) (see below).

The letter Y is only used in loanwords and several digraphs (gy, ly, ny, ty), and thus in a native Hungarian word, Y never comes as the initial of a word, except in loanwords. So, for native Hungarian words, the capital Y only exists in all caps or small caps formats, such as the titles of newspapers.

=== Historic spellings used in names and historical documents===
Old spellings (sometimes similar to German orthography) used in some Hungarian names and their corresponding pronunciation according to modern spelling include the following:


On áá: 

Generally, y in historic spellings of names formed with the &quot;-i&quot; affix (not to be confused with a possessive -i- of plural objects, as in &quot;szavai&quot;!) can exist after many other letters (e.g.: &quot;Teleky&quot;, &quot;Rákóczy&quot;, &quot;Dézsy&quot;). Here are listed only examples which can be easily misread because of such spelling.

Examples:
=== Historic spellings of article and conjunctions ===
In early editions the article &quot;a/az&quot; was written according to the following rules:
* before &quot;vowels&quot; and h — &quot;az&quot;: &quot;az ember&quot;, az híd
* before &quot;consonants&quot; — &quot;a: &quot;a&#x27; cs&quot;&#x27;illag&quot;.

The abbreviated form of the conjunction &quot;és&quot; (and), which is always written today as &quot;s&quot;, was likely to be written with an apostrophe before — ’s (e.g. &quot;föld ’s nép&quot;).

== Capitalisation ==
The di- and the trigraphs are capitalised in names and at the beginning of sentences by capitalising the first glyph of them only.
*Csak jót mondhatunk Székely Csabáról.

In abbreviations and when writing with all capital letters, however, one capitalises the second (and third) character as well.

Thus (&quot;The Rules of Hungarian Orthography&quot;, a book edited by the &quot;Hungarian Academy of Sciences&quot;):
*A magyar helyesírás szabályai
*MHSZ (not MHSz)
*A MAGYAR HELYESÍRÁS SZABÁLYAI (not SzABÁLyAI)

== Alphabetical ordering (collation) ==
While the characters with diacritical marks are considered separate letters, vowels that differ only in length are treated the same when ordering words. Therefore, for example, the pairs O/Ó and Ö/Ő are not distinguished in ordering, but Ö follows O. In cases where two words are differentiated solely by the presence of an accent, the one without the accent is put before the other one. (The situation is the same for lower and upper-case letters: in alphabetical ordering, &quot;varga&quot; is followed by &quot;Varga&quot;.)

The polygraphic consonant signs are treated as single letters.
The simplified geminates of multigraphs (see above) such as &lt;nny&gt;, &lt;ssz&gt; are collated as &lt;ny&gt;+&lt;ny&gt;, &lt;sz&gt;+&lt;sz&gt; etc., &quot;if&quot; they are double geminates, rather than co-occurrences of a single letter and a geminate.
:&quot;könnyű&quot; is collated as &lt;k&gt;&lt;ö&gt;&lt;ny&gt;&lt;ny&gt;&lt;ű&gt;. &quot;tizennyolc&quot; of course as &lt;t&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;z&gt;&lt;e&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;ny&gt;&lt;o&gt;&lt;l&gt;&lt;c&gt;, as this is a compound: &quot;tizen&quot;+&quot;nyolc&quot; (&#x27;above ten&#x27; + &#x27;eight&#x27; = &#x27;eighteen&#x27;).
Similar &#x27;ambiguities&#x27;, which can occur with compounds (which are highly common in Hungarian) are dissolved and collated by sense.
:e.g. &quot;házszám&quot; &#x27;house number (address)&#x27; = &quot;ház&quot; + &quot;szám&quot; and of course not *&quot;házs&quot; + *&quot;zám&quot;.
These rules make Hungarian alphabetic ordering algorithmically difficult (one has to know the correct segmentation of a word to sort it correctly), which was a problem for computer software development.

== Keyboard layout ==
The standard Hungarian keyboard layout is German-based (QWERTZ). This layout allows direct access to every character in the Hungarian alphabet.

The letter &quot;Í&quot; is often placed left of the space key, leaving the width of the left Shift key intact. &quot;Ű&quot; may be located to the left of Backspace, making that key smaller, but allowing for a larger Enter key. Ű being close to Enter often leads to it being typed instead of hitting Enter, especially when one has just switched from a keyboard that has Ű next to backspace. The German &quot;Ä&quot; and &quot;ß&quot;, the Polish &quot;Ł&quot;, and the Croatian &quot;Đ&quot; are also present.

== Letter frequencies ==
The most common letters in Hungarian are &quot;e&quot; and &quot;a&quot;.

The list below shows the letter frequencies for the &quot;smaller&quot; Hungarian alphabet in descending order (sample: 9620 letters).
==The spelling alphabet==
Note that some letters were omitted (notably, Dz, Dzs, Gy, Í, Ly, Ny, Ty, Ú, Ű).

== Old Hungarian script ==
The Old Hungarian script is a writing system formerly used for the Hungarian language. It was derived from the Old Turkic script. Its usage began to decline after the Kingdom of Hungary adopted the Latin alphabet. 

Epigraphic evidence for the use of the Old Hungarian script in medieval Hungary dates to the 10th century. At the turn of the 11th century, with the coronation of Stephen I of Hungary, Hungary became a kingdom and the Latin alphabet was adopted as official script.

The runic script was first mentioned in the 13th century Chronicle of Simon of Kéza, where he stated that the Székelys may use the script of the Blaks. Johannes Thuróczy wrote in the Chronica Hungarorum that the Székelys did not forget the Scythian letters and these are engraved on sticks by carving.

Its usage between the 11th and 19th centuries is believed to have been limited, although it featured in folk art of the Early Modern period. The script experienced a revival in the 20th century. Beginning with Adorján Magyar in 1915, the script has been promulgated as a means for writing modern Hungarian.

<doc id="280812" wikidata="Q551725" url="?curid=280812" title="Paul Scarron">
<text>Paul Scarron (; – 6 October 1660) (a.k.a. Monsieur Scarron) was a French poet, dramatist, and novelist, born in Paris. Though his precise birth date is unknown, he was baptized on 4 July 1610. Scarron was the first husband of Françoise d&#x27;Aubigné, who later became Madame de Maintenon and secretly married King Louis XIV of France.

==Life==
Scarron was born and died in Paris. He was the seventh child of Paul Scarron, a noble of the robe and member of the Parlement of Paris, and Gabrielle Goguet. Paul became an abbé when he was nineteen. He lived in Le Mans from 1632 to 1640, and in 1635 traveled to Rome with his patron, Charles de Beaumanoir, the bishop of Le Mans. Finding a patron in Marie de Hautefort, maîtresse-en-titre of Louis XIII, he became a well-known figure in literary and fashionable society.
In 1638, Scarron became disabled. One source (Laurent Angliviel de la Beaumelle, &quot;Memoires... de Mme de Maintenon&quot;) attributed Scarron&#x27;s deformities to rheumatism contracted from spending time in a swamp. According to this story, Scarron, while residing at Le Mans, once tarred and feathered himself as a carnival freak and was obliged to hide in a swamp to escape the wrath of the townspeople. Another story has Scarron falling into an ice-water bath during the Carnival season. It seems more likely, seeing the connection with water, that he was disabled by polio.

Whatever the cause, Scarron began to suffer from hardships and pain. His upper body became permanently twisted and his legs were paralyzed; he was obliged to use a wheelchair, and began taking copious amounts of opium to relieve his pain. Adding to his misfortunes, he became involved in a series of lawsuits with his stepmother over his father&#x27;s property, as well as being obliged to support his sisters financially.

Scarron returned to Paris in 1640. In 1643, he published &quot;Recueil de quelques vers burlesques&quot; (&quot;A Collection of Some Burlesque Verses&quot;), and the next year published &quot;Typhon ou la gigantomachie&quot;. At Le Mans he had conceived the idea of his &quot;Roman comique&quot; (&quot;Comic Novel&quot;), the first part of which was printed in 1651.

In 1645, his comedy &quot;Jodelet, ou le maître valet&quot; (&quot;Jodelet, or the Valet as Master&quot;) – the actor who played the leading role was also called Jodelet. &quot;Jodelet&quot; was the first of many French comedies about a servant who takes on the role of master, an idea that Scarron borrowed from the Spanish.

Scarron became employed by the bookseller Quinet and called his works his &quot;marquisat de Quinet.&quot; He had also a pension from Nicolas Fouquet, and one from the queen. Scarron had initially dedicated &quot;Typhon&quot; to Mazarin, who was not impressed with the work; Scarron then changed it to a burlesque on Mazarin. In 1651 he expressed his allegiance to the Fronde by writing a violent anti-Mazarin pamphlet, and lost his pensions due to this.

In his early years, Scarron was something of a libertine. In 1649 a penniless lady of good family, Céleste de Palaiseau, kept his house in the Rue d&#x27;Enfer, and tried to reform the habits of Scarron and his circle.

In 1652, he married the impoverished but beautiful Françoise d&#x27;Aubigné, afterwards famous as Madame de Maintenon, second wife of Louis XIV. He died in Paris on 6 October 1660.

==Epitaph==
Scarron wrote his own epitaph, which makes reference to the terrible physical pain he suffered during the last years of his life:

:&quot;Celui qui cy maintenant dort&quot;
:&quot;Fit plus de pitié que d&#x27;envie,&quot;
:&quot;Et souffrit mille fois la mort&quot;
:&quot;Avant que de perdre la vie.&quot;
:&quot;Passant, ne fais ici de bruit
:&quot;Garde bien que tu ne l&#x27;éveilles :&quot;
:&quot;Car voici la première nuit&quot;
:&quot;Que le pauvre Scarron sommeille.&quot;

:&quot;He who sleeps here now
:Deserved more pity than envy,
:And suffered death a thousand times
:Before losing his life.
:Passer-by, do not make noise here
:Be careful not to wake him
:Because this is the first night
:That poor Scarron slumbers.&quot;

==Works==

Scarron was very prolific as an author. The piece most famous in his own day was his &quot;Virgile travesti&quot; (1648–1653), a parody of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, but the reputation of this work later declined. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot;, the &quot;Virgile travesti&quot; &quot;is now thought a somewhat ignoble waste of singular powers for burlesque&quot; and the &quot;Roman comique&quot; (1651–1657) is Scarron&#x27;s best work: &quot;This history of a troupe of strolling actors... is almost the first French novel...which shows real power of painting manners and character, and is singularly vivid. It is in the style of the Spanish picaresque romance, and furnished Théophile Gautier with the idea and with some of the details of his &quot;Capitaine Fracasse&quot;.&quot;

Scarron also wrote some shorter novellas, including &quot;La Precaution inutile&quot;, which inspired Sedaine&#x27;s &quot;Gageure imprévue; Les Hypocrites&quot; and may also have inspired Molière&#x27;s &quot;Tartuffe&quot;. His plays include &quot;Jodelet&quot; (1645), &quot;Don Japhet d&#x27;Arménie&quot; (1653), &quot;L&#x27;Écolier de Salamanque&quot; (1654), &quot;Le Marquis ridicule ou la comtesse faite à la hâte&quot; (1655), &quot;La Fausse Apparence&quot; (1657), &quot;Le Prince corsaire&quot; (1658).

Most of his works were adapted from Spanish sources, particularly Tirso de Molina and Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla.

Scarron is a character in the D&#x27;Artagnan romance &quot;Twenty Years After&quot; by Alexandre Dumas.

== The &quot;Roman Comique&quot; ==

The &quot;Roman Comique&quot; tells the adventures of a company of strolling players in a realistic setting, thus providing much information concerning the customs of these companies of actors. The main plot tells the misadventures of Destin&#x27;s acting company and presents us with an intrusive narrator who disappears when some of the characters tell their life stories such as Destin, La Caverne and La Garouffiere. These stories have a higher tone than the main plot since they tell of past loves among the nobility. In the end the reader is able to unveil many of the mysteries of the novel and the relationship between the heroic material from the past and the comic adventures of the present since L&#x27;Estoile is the noble Leonore in disguise. The novel also borrows some of its humor (partially embodied in Ragotin) from Miguel de Cervantes&#x27;s Don Quixote as well as from Menippean satire. It also contains four interpolated tales, taken mainly from Spanish sources. The most famous is the novella of the &quot;Invisible Mistress,&quot; a comic adaptation of the more serious tale by Alonso de Castillo Solorzano. This tale, which includes a number of comic narrative intrusions, would be reworked by a number of English authors such as Thomas Otway and Eliza Haywood.

The earliest English translation was in 1665 by John Bulteel, titled &quot;The Comical Romance&quot;. The &quot;Brown-Savage&quot; translation was published in 1700. In 2012, it was newly translated by Jacques Houis as &quot;The Comic Romance&quot;.

<doc id="280819" wikidata="Q1685608" url="?curid=280819" title="Jean Jules Jusserand">
<text>Jean Adrien Antoine Jules Jusserand (18 February 1855 – 18 July 1932) was a French author and diplomat. He was the French Ambassador to the United States 1903-1925 and played a major diplomatic role during World War I.

== Birth and education ==
Born into a rich Lyonnais family, Jean Jules Jusserand spent his childhood between his familial residence in Saint-Haon-le-Châtel and Chalon&#x27;s boarding school in Lyon. After his father&#x27;s death in 1870, he was determined to honour him by learning new cultures and excelling in his international and bicultural career.

After his scholarship in Chartreux, he continued his studies at the University of Lyon, not knowing where these studies would lead him. He also wanted to increase his knowledge, which he judged insufficient. He studied literature, science, law and history, where he became an excellent student in all the subjects. He received two licenses, history and law, and, despite the worries his family had about him not completing his studies, he obtained a doctorate in history. Jusserand continued travelling across the world, learning languages and discovering new horizons. He completed his studies in 1875 and pursued an international career.

== Career ==
His career started in 1878 when he applied to the Foreign Affairs national competition, at the age of 23. He first started as a student-consul, and he was then kept as a help-consul in London under the direction of Mr. Langlet, who congratulated him on his remarkable work. In 1880, he became sous-chef of the &#x27;cabinet de Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire&#x27;, where he worked as minister of foreign affairs. His literary work enabled him to reach a higher status as Paul Cambon&#x27;s partner, the Minister of France in Tunisia, in 1882. During this time Jusserand was in charge of the administrative organisation of the protectorate. He became known as a respected diplomat, thanks to his contributions to the great humanization of the protectorate. Jusserand came back to the Quai d’Orsay In 1887, in a delicate moment, where he worked in the political sector. In 1898 he exercised in the role of emissary near Saint-Siège, then Minister of France in Copenhagen. In 1902 Jusserand was named Ambassador to the United States, under the presidency of Loubet.

== Ambassador in Washington ==
=== Before the war ===
As the new French ambassador in Washington, Jean Jules Jusserand succeeded Jules Cambon who, in Madrid, was replacing his brother Paul Cambon, himself nominated in London. Jusserand took up his position on 7 February 1903.

Jusserand was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1907.

In 1911, he was admitted as an Honorary Member of the Society of the Cincinnati in the State of New Jersey.

He was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1912.

He soon won Roosevelt&#x27;s sympathy, in addition to the President&#x27;s successors&#x27;. Thus, during 22 years, Jusserand was the French politic spokesperson alongside 5 presidents of the United States (Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson, Harding and Coolidge), especially he had served as Dean of the Diplomatic Corps from May 1913 to January 1925.

As in June 1905, the French and German concurrence over Morocco&#x27;s domination nearly lead to a war. Jusserand used his influence on Roosevelt in order to play an efficient role in the Algeciras Conference. The support that was brought by the United States and the United Kingdom to France helped the French access to the Cherifian Empire (known today as the Moroccan Empire.). Everything happened in a very friendly and courteous manner, several American and French personalities considered that the ambassador had &quot;saved the peace&quot;.

=== During the war ===
Jean Jules Jusserand played an important role in the United States&#x27;s entry into the war. As early as 1914, he campaigned for the entry of the United States to support France. It was a period of anguish and concern for Jusserand because the American public&#x27;s opinion was very divided. It took the Americans more than three years to enter the war, being triggered by the submarine campaign launched by Germany.

On 12 March 1917, the House of Representatives authorised the arming of commercial vessels. Following the attack on two US ships by German U-boats, the US president realised on 20 March that the US was in fact at war with Germany. The United States would not be able to limit its intervention to the naval domain alone. On 2 April, he announced to Congress that he wished to go to war alongside the Entente, sending troops on French soil, thus directly entering the conflict. The US Senate approved this resolution by 82 votes to 6. On 6 April 1917, the US was officially at war. On 28 June 1917, the first American division landed at Saint-Nazaire. Jean Jules Jusserand said on this occasion: &quot;For the first time, a neutral nation has decided to enter the conflict without prior bargaining, without having laid down a condition.&quot;

On 10 May 1917, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau sent him a telegram to congratulate him on his action, saying &quot;All you have said is excellent.&quot; On 5 September, the United States of America participated in their first offensive against Germany. On 11 November, during an allied offensive, the armistice was signed, thus ending the First World War.

He helped to support of professor Thomas Garrigue Masaryk legions especially in Russia and in negotiation for independent Czechoslovak state in America from May to October 1918.

For the Versailles negotiations, President Wilson was accompanied in France by Jean Jules Jusserand, whom he trusted. As a matter of fact, Wilson was the first incumbent US president to come to Europe. The Paris Peace Conference, beginning on 18 January 1919, culminated in the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June, establishing a seemingly definitive peace.

After a brief period of harmony lasting only 22 years, another world conflict ensued in 1939. However, Jusserand had no influence on this Second world war, passing away in 1932.

=== After the war ===

Even after the First World War, Jean Jules Jusserand was still fighting to maintain the peace obtained after so many efforts and sacrifices. He accompanied the American President Woodrow Wilson to the Paris Peace Conference (1919), during which was signed the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919. When the Polish army invaded Ukraine, a Russian counter-attack reached Warsaw, where there was a rise in revolutionary ideas. France sent Jusserand at the head of a diplomatic and military mission to save the Polish.

He remained the French ambassador to Washington for the next five years under presidents Warren G Harding and Calvin Coolidge. During this time, he published a dozen books in French and English, on various subjects. Later on he returned to France, where he spent some time with his wife in Saint-Haon-le-Châtel, their property in Forez.

In 1923, Jean Jules Jusserand presided and delivered a speech during the inauguration ceremony for the American war memorial.

At the age of seventy, he retired. Émile Daeschner succeeded him in 1924, followed by Henry Bérenger on 1 January 1925.

On 10 January 1925, a farewell banquet was organised in his honour by the American government in order to express their esteem and gratitude. This ceremony brought together the most important political, scientific and cultural figures of the United States. He was also awarded a medal for his deeds.

In 1930, Jean Jules Jusserand published his last book, &quot;The evolution of the American sentiment during the war&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;évolution du sentiment américain pendant la guerre&quot;).

He died in 1932 in Paris at the age of 77, following a lengthy bout of kidney disease. His national funeral took place in Notre-Dame, and his body rests in the family home in Saint-Haon-le-Châtel.

== Alliance Française ==

In 1884, Jean Jules Jusserand took part in the foundation of the Alliance Française. The Alliance Française is a French organisation which aims to promote French culture and language, especially after France&#x27;s defeat by Germany in 1870.

This association is not subject to any political or religious influence.

The Fondation de l’Alliance Française is the &quot;moral and juridic reference&quot; for the other Alliances Françaises. It is she whom approves the formation of new Alliances françaises by approving their status. It helps the Alliances to form employees, and guide them in the extension of their activities or even when they go through tough times.

The Alliance Française has buildings all around the world and is today the biggest cultural Non-Governmental Organisation of the world with around 1000 establishments in more than 136 countries. The Alliance Française in Lyon was created in 1984 and has received many Labels since then. Nowadays, it is the first French language school in Lyon and the third Alliance Française in France. Within it, there is a multicultural team of 40 people, who welcome 2500 students per year and more than 130 nationalities. The 2,500 m2 of modern locals dedicated to the study and learning of languages with 17 classrooms. It perpetuates the founders&#x27; spirit, including Jusserand&#x27;s.

==Legacy==
Even today, different monuments exist in France and the United States in order to commemorate Jusserand&#x27;s diplomatic role.

A pink granite bench in Rock Creek Park honoring Jusserand was dedicated by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on 7 November 1936. It is the first memorial erected on Federal property to a foreign diplomat. In 2014 &quot;Washington City Paper&quot; called it the &quot;best obscure memorial&quot; in D.C.

==Literary work==
He wrote a series of articles published in &quot;&quot; on the history of French reactions to Shakespeare.
Jusserand was a close student of English literature who produced some lucid and vivacious books on comparatively little-known subjects:

<doc id="280822" wikidata="Q3427997" url="?curid=280822" title="Battle of Ratan">
<text>The Battle of Ratan was the last battle fought on Swedish soil during the Russian-Swedish War of 1808 - 1809. It took place a day apart from the Battle of Sävar, on 20 August 1809. Having conquered Finland from Sweden, the Russians had a small force in the northern areas of Sweden, which the Swedes sought to eliminate through a combined assault from land and sea. The Russians moved rapidly to defend, defeating the Swedish force landed at Ratan at Sävar on 19 August. The next day, on 20 August, the Swedish riflemen was attacked and pushed out of Ratan, turning to the flotilla and starting the evacuation. At the same time, artillery fire from Swedish warships kept the Russians at bay. Peace negotiations followed the heavy fighting.

== Prelude to the battle ==

The Russians had successfully captured the city of Umeå and driven the Swedish army commanded by Sandels south, to Härnösand. Tsar Alexander I of Russia demanded that Sweden cede all of Finland. To achieve a better negotiating position, the Swedish army command planned to land troops north of the Russian positions in Umeå to attack the Russian army from the rear, while the mainland army of 3,400 men under Fabian Wrede attacked them from the front.

Chosen to lead the sea-borne task force was Lieutenant-General Gustav Wachtmeister. Battle proven in the Prussian army, in the Russo-Swedish War 1789-1790, and in the Pomeranian War just two years earlier. There was talk on giving the command to von Döbeln, but Wachtmeister was chosen.

There was no threat from the Russians possible on the waters, as the combined force of the Swedish navy and the Royal Navy had the Russian fleet at bay. The task force left Stockholm on 8 August and sailed north towards Ratan 45 km north from Umeå. To avoid detection by the Russian army in Umeå, the task force sailed east of Holmön. It arrived at Ratan 16 August. The attack was planned for 19 August.

The Swedish task force sent was included the following vessels from both the navy and the archipelago fleet:
* 2 ships of the line (&quot;Adolf Fredrik&quot; and &quot;Försiktigheten&quot;)
* 1 frigate (&quot;Jarramas&quot;)
* 44 gunboats and bomb vessels
* 6 galleys
* 20-40 troop transport ships
* 6,800 soldiers

On 17 August the Swedish army disembarked from their ships in Ratan. Later the same day, they destroyed a small Russian detachment in Djäkneboda. The Russian commander, Lieutenant-General Nikolay Mikhailovich Kamensky, was marching south when he learned of the Swedish task force. He quickly wheeled around and marched north to face Wachtmeister&#x27;s army before Wrede&#x27;s arrived.

The Swedish force under Wachtmeister was delayed at Sävar 20 km north of Umeå. The Russians attacked Wachtmeister&#x27;s force in Sävar at 07:30 on 19 August. The Russian force took possession of high ground immediately and the Swedes counterattacked the Russians uphill. A fierce battle broke out and despite Swedish success in the fighting, Wachtmeister ordered his forces to retreat back to Ratan. The Battle of Sävar was over at 15:00. Although the Battle of Sävar turned out as a Russian victory, the Russian army was too damaged to dare face Wrede advancing from the south.

At Sävar, Sweden suffered casualties of 396 men dead and around 450 wounded, the Russians suffered around 600 men dead and around 1000 wounded.

== Description of the battle ==
After the Battle of Sävar, the Swedish force fell back to the village of Ratan, in which they immediately prepared for another battle. On 20 August Kamensky ordered his army to attack the Swedes in a delaying battle to secure the Russian supply wagons&#x27; retreat north. This time Sweden had support from their artillery, not only the ground-based, but also the cannons loaded on the Swedish fleet. Altogether, around 100 cannons were available for the Swedish army. The artillery barrage destroyed large parts of the village and its surroundings.

During the Battle of Ratan, Wachtmeister, due to support of the flotilla, managed to hold off Kamensky, who afterwards retreated north towards Piteå. Shortly after, Swedish troops entered Umeå.

Casualties at Ratan numbered 150 to 181 Swedes (26 dead, 2 prisoners). About 150 Russians were lost according to Kamensky, while Swedish reports mention 500–700 Russian casualties.

== Aftermath ==

The Russians managed to take Ratan, but then were forced to abandon it due to Swedish flotilla fire. The Russian cannonballs did not reach the Swedish fleet. A forward line of Russian jägers stood in the woods. The Swedish field force was not defeated thanks to the fleet, boarded the ships unhindered, and sailed away to safety. The Russian army could not stay with the enemy advancing from the south having just suffered so many casualties. Instead it retreated north after the battle, easing the situation for the Swedish army. It has also been argued that the outcomes of the battles helped Sweden to achieve a better position in the peace negotiations with Russia. Czar Alexander of Russia had demanded all of Österland, Åland, the parts of Norrland in present-day Finland and parts of Norrland in present-day Sweden. The Czar&#x27;s demand was for the border to be drawn at the Kalix River. The engagements in Sävar and Ratan have been argued to have helped move the border north to the Tornio and Muonio rivers in the peace talks.

Having the border further north than demanded by the Russians in the initial talks turned out to be fortunate for Sweden in the long run as major findings of iron ore were discovered in these areas later.

<doc id="280856" wikidata="Q230670" url="?curid=280856" title="Françoise d'Aubigné, Marquise de Maintenon">
<text>Françoise d&#x27;Aubigné (27 November 1635 – 15 April 1719), known first as Madame Scarron and subsequently as Madame de Maintenon (), was a French noblewoman and the second wife of Louis XIV of France from 1683 until his death in 1715. Although she was never considered queen of France, as the marriage was carried out in secret, Madame de Maintenon had considerable political influence as one of the King&#x27;s closest advisers and the governess of the royal children.

Born into an impoverished Huguenot noble family, Françoise married the poet Paul Scarron in 1652, which allowed her access to the Parisian high society. She was widowed in 1660, but later saw her fortunes improve through her friendship with Louis XIV&#x27;s mistress, Madame de Montespan, who tasked her with the upbringing of the king&#x27;s extramarital children. She was made royal governess when the children were legitimised, and in 1675 Louis XIV granted her the title Marquise de Maintenon. By the late 1670s, she had essentially supplanted Montespan as the king&#x27;s &quot;maîtresse-en-titre&quot;.

After the death of Queen Maria Theresa in 1683, Madame de Maintenon married Louis in a private ceremony. She came to be regarded as the second most powerful person in France, and her piety had a strong influence on her husband, who became firmer in his Catholic faith and had no more open mistresses. In 1686, she founded the &quot;Maison royale de Saint-Louis&quot;, a school for girls from impoverished noble families, which had a significant influence on female education under the Ancien Régime. After Louis XIV&#x27;s death in 1715, Madame de Maintenon retired to Saint-Cyr, where she died four years later at the age of 83.

==Childhood==

=== Birth at Niort ===

Françoise d&#x27;Aubigné was born on 27 November 1635, in Niort, France. A plaque suggests her birthplace was at the Hotel du Chaumont, but some sources indicate she was born in or just outside the local prison, where her Huguenot father Constant d&#x27;Aubigné was incarcerated for conspiring against King Louis XIII&#x27;s powerful chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu. Her mother, Jeanne de Cardilhac, was the daughter of the prison director and was probably seduced by the incarcerated Constant. She was a fervent Catholic and had her child baptised in her religion. Her paternal grandfather was Agrippa d&#x27;Aubigné, a former intimate servant of the late king Henry IV well known for his roles as Protestant general and propagandist. Her godmother was the nine-year-old Suzanne de Baudéan, daughter of the comtesse de Neuillant and the governor of Niort, and her godfather was the duc de la Rochefoucauld, father of François de La Rochefoucauld, the author of the famous &quot;Maxims&quot;.

=== Protestant upbringing ===
In 1639, Constant was released from prison and went with Jeanne and Françoise to the French island colony of Martinique in the West Indies. Jeanne was a strict mother, allowing her children few liberties. She gave them a Protestant education despite their Catholic baptism. Constant returned to France, leaving his family behind in Martinique, causing Jeanne to try to be &quot;mother and father&quot; to their children until they also returned to France, in 1647. Within months of the family&#x27;s return, both parents died, and the children went to the care of their paternal aunt, Madame de Villette. The Villettes&#x27; home, Mursay, became a happy memory for Françoise, who had been in the care of her aunt and uncle before leaving for Martinique. The de Villettes were wealthy and took good care of the children, but were ardent Protestants and continued to school their nieces and nephews in their beliefs. When this became known to the family of Françoise&#x27;s godmother, an order was issued that she had to be educated in a convent.

=== Education ===
Françoise disliked convent life, mainly because she received only limited education and freedom. Her lessons included basic mathematics, French, Latin, and domestic work. The main emphasis was on religion and liturgy, with no opening onto the secular world. Despite her disgust, Françoise grew to love one of the nuns there, Sister Céleste, who persuaded the young girl to receive her first communion. In her older days, Maintenon would say, &quot;I loved [Sister Céleste] more than I could possibly say. I wanted to sacrifice myself for her service.&quot; Françoise would also prove adept in the art of writing, going on to send more than 90,000 letters in her lifetime.

Madame de Neuillant, the mother of Françoise&#x27;s godmother, then brought the girl to Paris and introduced her to sophisticated people, who became vital contacts that she would use in the future. 

==Arrival at the court==

=== Marriage ===

In her excursion with Madame de Neuillant, Françoise met accomplished poet Paul Scarron, 
who was 25 years her senior, and began to correspond with him. He counted King Louis XIII&#x27;s favourites among his patrons and offered her marriage or pay her dowry so that she might enter a convent. Although Scarron suffered from chronic and crippling pain, Françoise accepted his proposal and the two married in 1652. The match permitted her to gain access to the highest levels of Parisian society, something that would have otherwise been impossible for a girl from an impoverished background. For nine years, she was more a nurse than a wife to Paul who, in turn, gave her exposure to education and a vocation as a teacher.

=== Royal governess ===
After Paul Scarron&#x27;s death in 1660, the Queen Mother Anne of Austria continued his pension to his widow and even increased it to 2,000 livres a year, thus enabling Françoise to remain in literary society. After his mother&#x27;s death in 1666, Louis XIV suspended the pension. Once again in straitened circumstances and having spent several years living off the charity of her friends, Madame Scarron prepared to leave Paris for Lisbon as a lady-in-waiting to the new queen of Portugal, Marie-Françoise de Nemours. Before setting off, however, she met Madame de Montespan, who was secretly already the king&#x27;s mistress. Montespan took such a fancy to Scarron that she had the king reinstate her pension, which enabled the latter to stay in Paris.

In 1669, Madame de Montespan placed her second child by Louis XIV with Madame Scarron in a house on Rue de Vaugirard, provided with a large income and staff of servants. Scarron took care to keep the house well-guarded and discreet, doing many duties as secretary and caretaker. Her care for the infant Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine (born 1670) first brought her to the attention of Louis XIV, though he was initially repelled by her strong temper and strict religious practice. After Louis Auguste and his siblings were legitimised on 20 December 1673, she moved to the Château de Saint-Germain and became the Governess of the Children of France, one of the very few people permitted to speak candidly with the king as an equal. Madame de Sévigné observed that Louis XIV was charmed by having someone who would speak to him in this way.

Due to her hard work, the king rewarded Scarron with 200,000 livres, which she used to purchase the property at Maintenon in 1674. In 1675, Louis XIV gave her the title of Marquise de Maintenon after the name of her estate. Such favours incurred the jealousy of Madame de Montespan, who began to spar frequently over the children and their care. In 1680, the king made Madame de Maintenon the second mistress of the robes to his daughter-in-law, the Dauphine. Soon after the Affair of the Poisons, Montespan left the court and was unofficially replaced by de Maintenon, who proved to be a good influence on Louis XIV. His wife, Queen Marie Thérèse, who for years had been rudely treated by Madame de Montespan, openly declared she had never been so well-treated as at this time.

==Uncrowned queen of France==

=== Secret marriage to Louis XIV ===

&quot;Madame de Maintenon knows how to love. There would be great pleasure in being loved by her,&quot; said the king, Louis XIV. He probably asked her to become his mistress at that time. Though she later claimed she didn&#x27;t yield to his advances (&quot;Nothing is so clever as to conduct one&#x27;s self irreproachably,&quot;) the king spent much of his spare time with the royal governess by the late 1670s, discussing politics, economics, and religion. After the death of Marie-Thérèse, Françoise married Louis in a private ceremony by François de Harlay de Champvallon, archbishop of Paris. It is believed that in attendance were Père la Chaise, the king&#x27;s confessor, the Marquis de Montchevreuil, the Chevalier de Forbin and Alexandre Bontemps, a valet with whom the groom was very close. Owing to the disparity in their social status, the marriage was morganatic, meaning that Madame de Maintenon wasn&#x27;t openly acknowledged as the king&#x27;s wife and didn&#x27;t become queen. No official documentation of the marriage exists, but that it took place is nevertheless accepted by historians. Biographers have dated the wedding to 9 October 1683 or January 1684.

In his memoirs, the duc de Saint-Simon (himself only a boy at the time of the event) wrote the following:
&quot;But what is very certain and very true, is, that some time after the return of the King from Fontainebleau, and in the midst of the winter that followed the death of the Queen (posterity will with difficulty believe it, although perfectly true and proved), Père de la Chaise, confessor of the King, said mass at the dead of night in one of the King&#x27;s cabinets at Versailles. Bontemps, governor of Versailles, chief valet on duty, and the most confidential of the four, was present at this mass, at which the monarch and La Maintenon were married in presence of Harlay, Archbishop of Paris, as diocesan, of Louvois (both of whom drew from the King a promise that he would never declare this marriage), and of Montchevreuil...&lt;br&gt;
The satiety of the honeymoon, usually so fatal, and especially the honeymoon of such marriages, only consolidated the favour of Madame de Maintenon. Soon after, she astonished everybody by the apartments given to her at Versailles, at the top of the grand staircase facing those of the King and on the same floor. From that moment the King always passed some hours with her every day of his life; wherever she might be she was always lodged near him, and on the same floor if possible.&quot;

The Marquise of Montespan wrote the following in her memoirs about the marriage between her former friend and ex-lover:
&quot;The following week, Madame de Maintenon... consented to the King&#x27;s will, which she had opposed in order to excite it, and in the presence of the Marquis and Marquise de Montchevreuil, the Duc de Noailles, the Marquis de Chamarante, M. Bontems and Mademoiselle Ninon, her permanent chambermaid, was married to the King of France and Navarre in the chapel of the château. The Abbé de Harlay, Archbishop of Paris, assisted by the Bishop of Chartres and Père de la Chaise, had the honour of blessing this marriage and presenting the rings of gold. After the ceremony, which took place at an early hour, and even by torchlight, there was a slight repast in the small apartments. The same persons, taking carriages, then repaired to Maintenon, where the great ceremony, the mass, and all that is customary in such cases were celebrated. At her return, Madame de Maintenon took possession of an extremely sumptuous apartment that had been carefully arranged and furnished for her. Her people continued to wear her livery, but she scarcely ever rode anymore except in the great carriage of the King, where we saw her in the place, which had been occupied by the Queen. In her interior, the title of Majesty was given her, and the King, when he had to speak of her, only used the word Madame, without adding Maintenon, that having become too familiar and trivial.&quot;

=== Political influence ===
Historians have often remarked upon Madame de Maintenon&#x27;s political influence, which was considerable. She was regarded as the next most powerful person after the king, considered the equivalent of a prime minister after 1700. Without an official position as queen, she was more easily approached by those wishing to have an audience with the king. However, her judgment wasn&#x27;t infallible and some mistakes were undoubtedly made; replacing the military commander Nicolas Catinat by the Duke of Villeroi in 1701 may be attributed to her, but certainly not the Spanish Succession.

As a strongly religious person, Madame de Maintenon had a strong influence on her husband, who no longer had open mistresses and banned operas during Lent. Some have accused her of responsibility for the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and for the &quot;dragonnades&quot;, but recent investigations have shown that she opposed the cruelties of the &quot;dragonnades&quot;, though she was pleased with the conversions they produced. She told her confessor that in view of her own Protestant upbringing, she feared that a plea for tolerance on behalf of the Huguenots might lead her enemies to claim that she was still a secret Protestant. In 1692, Pope Innocent XII granted her the right of visitation over all the convents in France. Unlike what others believed, Madame de Maintenon mainly used her power for personal patronage- for example, in the frequent economical assistance she gave to her brother Charles d&#x27;Aubigné, Comte d&#x27;Aubigné. In the latter years of her life, she encouraged her husband to promote her previous charges, the children of the king by Madame de Montespan, to high positions at court intermediate between the prince and princesses du sang and the peers of the realm.

==Educational efforts==
Madame de Maintenon founded the &quot;Maison royale de Saint-Louis&quot;, a school for girls of impoverished noble families, who were becoming increasingly numerous because many provincial noblemen died in wars or expended their fortunes in the King&#x27;s service. The school began at Rueil and moved to Noisy-le-Roi until the King endowed Saint-Cyr, a village 5 km west of Versailles, at her request by using the funds of the Abbey of St. Denis. According to her wishes, the education would be different from that traditionally practised in convents, where education was minimal and principally centred on religion: her students were educated to be ladies of the nobility, receiving an education that was severe but showed proof of the era&#x27;s modernity. Madame de Maintenon was considered a born teacher and a friendly, motherly influence on her pupils, who included Dauphine Marie-Adélaïde of Savoy.

Madame de Maintenon drew up the rules of the institution and attended to every detail. The school buildings housed 250 students, cared for by 36 lay female educators or &quot;professes&quot;, 24 &quot;converses&quot; sisters carrying out domestic tasks, and some priests. The students, aged 7 to 20, were divided by their uniform colour: red for 7 to 10 years old; green for 11 to 14; yellow for 15–16; blue for 17–20, and black for the most talented and disciplined from the &quot;blues&quot;. Each class had a timetable appropriate to its students&#x27; age: the &quot;reds&quot; learned arithmetic, geometry, reading and writing, along with receiving the rudiments of Catechism, Latin, and religious history; the &quot;greens&quot; continued in these subjects, along with geography and history; the &quot;yellows&quot; also learned drawing and dancing; the &quot;blues&quot; were initiated into heraldry, the history of the Catholic Church and more detailed teaching in morality; and the blacks were in charge of helping the teachers in classes, accounts, hospital, refectory, and sewing clothes for their fellow students or the teachers. Leisure time was also important for Maintenon, who encouraged the students to play intellectual games such as chess and checkers, though card games were banned. She asked Jean Racine to write &quot;Esther&quot; and &quot;Athalie&quot; for the girls at Saint-Cyr.

=== Influence in education ===
&quot;Maison royale de Saint-Louis&quot; is considered to have greatly influenced the demands of the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, the first women&#x27;s political interest group founded in 1793. Their successful attempt to link gender equality through the educational system&#x27;s reformation and the enforcement of the 1724 royal ordinance that imposed compulsory universal primary education, was inspired by the 17th-century treatises by Madame de Maintenon and François Fénelon. In the Revolutionary context, Madame de Maintenon&#x27;s ideas were used by local officials and philanthropists who successfully established neighbourhood primary schools that accepted many young poor girls. Her work had a lasting impact on the original feminist movement, which gathered in Parisian salons and during the Age of Enlightenment, one aim of which was to promote educational equality between sexes to both improve society with more capable workers and help lower-class women escape their condition and prostitution.

==Later life==
After her husband&#x27;s death in 1715, Françoise retired to the Maison royale de Saint-Louis at Saint-Cyr-l&#x27;École with a pension of 48,000 livres by the Duc d&#x27;Orléans and regent of France. She continued to receive visitors at Saint-Cyr, including Tsar Peter the Great of Russia. He was seated at a chair by the foot of her bed and asked what her illness was, to which she replied, &quot;Old age&quot;. She asked what brought him to her room, to which he replied, &quot;I came to see everything worthy of note that France contains.&quot; He later remarked to his aides that she had rendered a great service to the King and nation.

Françoise died on 15 April 1719, at the age of 83. Her will expressed her wishes to be buried in the choir at Saint-Cyr and bequeath her Château de Maintenon to her niece, Françoise Charlotte d&#x27;Aubigné, Duchess of Noailles and her brother Charles&#x27; only daughter. In her honour, a small island, off the coast of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada, which at that time was known as &quot;L&#x27;Île Royale&quot;, was attributed to her; this island was named Isle Madame (first noted as l&#x27;Isle de la Marquise).

<doc id="280865" wikidata="Q453571" url="?curid=280865" title="François de Neufville, 2nd Duke of Villeroy">
<text>François de Neufville, 2nd Duke of Villeroy (7 April 164418 July 1730) was a French Royal Army officer and nobleman.

==Biography==
Villeroy was born in Lyon into noble family which had risen into prominence in the reign of Charles IX. His father Nicolas V de Neufville, Marquis of Villeroy, Marshal of France (1598–1685) was governor of the young King Louis XIV who later made him a duke.

François was brought up in close relations with Louis XIV and became a member of his inner circle. As a young child, he played with the King and his younger brother the Prince Philippe in the Palais Royal (home of Louis XIV and his mother Anne of Austria) and the nearby Hôtel de Villeroy (the home of the young François de Villeroy and his father the governor Nicolas V de Villeroy, the historic Hôtel de Villeroy is a 500 m walk from the Palais-Royal on 34 rue des Bourdonnais or 9 rue des Déchargeurs). Even though Francois de Villeroy was six years younger than Louis XIV, they were friends, probably because the young Louis XIV enjoyed the role of protector to a younger child.

An intimate of the king, a finished courtier, and leader of society and a man of great personal gallantry, Villeroy was marked out for advancement in the French Royal Army, which he loved, but career soldiers had a more just appreciation of his abilities than Louis. In 1693, without having exercised any really-important or responsible command, he was made Marshal of France. In 1695, when François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg died, he obtained the command of the army in Flanders (see War of the Grand Alliance); William III found him a far easier opponent than the &quot;little hunchback&quot; (the duc de Luxembourg). Villeroy was responsible for the senseless bombardment of Brussels in 1695, which occasioned its reconstruction in the 18th century by giving it the regularity and unity of architecture seen today although it was again damaged in both World Wars.

In 1701, Villeroy was sent to Italy to supersede Nicolas Catinat and was soon beaten by the inferior army of Prince Eugene of Savoy at the Battle of Chiari (see War of the Spanish Succession). In February 1702 he was made prisoner at the surprise of the Battle of Cremona.

In the following years he was pitted against John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough in the Low Countries. Marlborough&#x27;s own difficulties with the Dutch and other allied commissioners, rather than Villeroy&#x27;s own skill, put off the inevitable disaster for some years, but in 1706 Marlborough attacked him and thoroughly defeated him at the Battle of Ramillies. Louis consoled his old friend with this remark: &quot;At our age, one is no longer lucky&quot;. However, Louis superseded Villeroy in the command, and Villeroy lived the life of a courtier and, although suspected of being involved in plots, maintained his friendship with Louis. During this time, his secretary was Pierre-François Godard de Beauchamps.

Under the Régence Villeroy was governor of the child King Louis XV and held several other high posts between 1717 and 1722, when he fell in disgrace for plotting against Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Orléans, Regent of France (regent for Louis XV) and was sent to be governor of Lyon, virtually in exile. His family suffered a further disgrace when two younger members, the duc de Retz and the marquis d&#x27;Alincourt were exiled for having homosexual relations in the gardens at Versailles. Louis XV recalled Villeroy into high office when he came of age.

Villeroy died in Paris in 1730.

== Marriage and children ==

He married on March 28, 1662 with Marguerite Marie de Cossé (1648–1708), and had 7 children: 
# Louis Nicolas de Neufville (1663–1734), Duke of Villeroy, who married Marguerite Le Tellier, daughter of the Marquis of Louvois;
# Camille de Neufville
# François Paul de Neufville (1677–1731), Archbishop of Lyon (1714) ;
# François Catherine de Neufville (died 1700) ;
# Madeleine Thérèse de Neufville (1666–1723), a nun ;
# Françoise Madeleine de Neufville, married João de Sousa, 3rd Marquis of Minas ;
# Catherine Anne de Neufville (1674–1715), a nun ;

<text>Nicolas Catinat (, 1 September 1637 – 22 February 1712) was a French military commander and Marshal of France under Louis XIV.

== Life ==
The son of a magistrate, Catinat was born in Paris on 1 September 1637. He entered the Gardes Françaises at an early age and distinguished himself at the Siege of Lille in 1667.

He became a brigadier ten years later, &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; in 1680, and lieutenant-general 1688. He served with great credit in the campaigns of 1676–1678 in Flanders during the Franco-Dutch War, and was later employed in the persecution of the Vaudois in 1686. After taking part in the Siege of Philippsburg at the opening of the Nine Years War, he was appointed to command the French troops in the south-eastern theatre of war. In 1691 he crossed into the County of Nice, and captured the towns Nice and Villefranche.

His victories against Victor Amadeus of Savoy at the Battle of Staffarda in 1690, and the Battle of Marsaglia in 1693, were amongst his greatest achievements, (Victor Amadeus II later abandoned the Allied coalition and concluded peace with King Louis by signing the Treaty of Turin on 29 August 1696). In 1693 Catinat was made a marshal of France and in 1697 he led the French forces in the victorious Siege of Ath.

At the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession, Catinat was placed in charge of operations in northern Italy, but he was much hampered by the orders of the French court and the weakness of his forces. Outmanoeuvred by Prince Eugene of Savoy, Catinat suffered a reverse at Carpi and was soon afterwards superseded by Marshal Villeroi. With Catinat acting as Villeroi&#x27;s second-in-command, French forces were again defeated by Eugene&#x27;s Imperialists at the Battle of Chiari. Catinat died at Saint-Gratien in 1712. His memoirs were published in 1819.

The British historian Geoffrey Treasure sums up Catinat:

Catinat was not the typical soldier of this period. He had begun life as a lawyer, with no advantage of birth, and made his way by sheer merit. He was a careful general, thorough and sparing of the lives of his men, unambitious and something of a philosopher. After his failure in the Italian campaign of the next war [i.e., the War of the Spanish Succession], he retired to the country to cultivate his garden.

== Legacy ==

The aphorism &quot;No man is a hero to his valet&quot; is sometimes attributed to Catinat, as well as other sources, including Michel de Montaigne and Madame de Sévigné.

Prince Edward has held the title of Duke of Kent for over years, making him the longest-serving duke in British history. He inherited the title at the age of six in 1942, following his father&#x27;s death in a plane crash. Edward carried out engagements on behalf of Elizabeth II and is involved with over 140 charitable organisations. He was president of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, presenting the trophies to the Wimbledon champion and runner-up, and served as the United Kingdom&#x27;s Special Representative for International Trade and Investment, retiring in 2001. He is joint president of The Scout Association, and president of the Royal United Services Institute and the Royal Institution of Great Britain, and since 1967 Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England. The Duke of Kent has been Chancellor of the University of Surrey since June 1976. Much of his charity work revolves around war remembrance, technology, and the growth of British industry.

==Early life and education==
Prince Edward was born on 9 October 1935, at No. 3 Belgrave Square, London, to Prince George and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, the Duke and Duchess of Kent. Home Secretary Sir John Simon was present to verify the birth. His father was the fourth son of King George V and Queen Mary. His mother was the daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia. He was baptised in the Private Chapel of Buckingham Palace on 20 November 1935 by Archbishop of Canterbury Cosmo Lang. His godparents were his grandparents, King George V, Queen Mary and Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark; as well as the Prince of Wales; the Princess Royal, the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (whose son, Prince Arthur of Connaught, stood proxy); and the Duchess of Argyll.

Prince Edward began his education at Ludgrove, a preparatory school in Berkshire, before going on to Eton College and then Le Rosey in Switzerland. After school he entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where he won the Sir James Moncrieff Grierson prize for foreign languages. Edward speaks fluent French, having been raised in a house where, according to the words of his younger brother, Prince Michael of Kent, his mother and aunts spoke French as a matter of preference.

On 25 August 1942, Prince Edward&#x27;s father, the Duke of Kent, was killed when his plane crashed in bad weather in Caithness. Prince Edward, at six years old, succeeded his father as Duke of Kent, Earl of St Andrews and Baron Downpatrick. As a member of the royal family, Prince Edward began performing engagements at an early age. In 1952, at the age of 16, he walked behind the coffin of his uncle, George VI, at his state funeral. In 1953, he attended the coronation of his cousin, Elizabeth II, and was the third to pay homage at her throne, following the dukes of Edinburgh and Gloucester.

==Military service==
On 29 July 1955, the Duke of Kent graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst as a second lieutenant in the Royal Scots Greys, the beginning of a military career which lasted over 20 years. He was promoted to captain on 29 July 1961.

From 1962 to 1963, the Duke of Kent served in Hong Kong, later serving on the staff in Eastern Command. He was promoted to major on 31 December 1967. In 1970, the Duke commanded a squadron of his regiment in Cyprus as part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. During the early 1970s, the Duke also served briefly in Northern Ireland with his regiment. It was revealed in a 2022 book, that the Queen intervened in 1971 to prevent the kidnapping of her cousin, the Duke of Kent. The then 35-year-old Duke, an Army officer with the Royal Scots Greys, was sent to Northern Ireland with his unit but the Queen alerted Edward Heath, the prime minister, during her private audience, and he relayed a warning to his ministers. Commanding officers were told the Duke was not to be sent to Belfast without special orders. A few weeks later, he was posted back to Britain. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 30 June 1973.

The Duke retired from the army on 15 April 1976. He was subsequently accorded the honorary rank of major-general on 11 June 1983, and of field marshal on 11 June 1993.

==Marriage and personal life==


At York Minster on 8 June 1961 the Duke of Kent married Katharine Worsley, the only daughter of Sir William Worsley, 4th Baronet, by his wife Joyce Morgan Brunner. She converted to Catholicism in 1994, but because the conversion occurred after their marriage, it did not cause the Duke to lose his place in the line of succession, as the Act of Settlement 1701 only applied where the spouse was a Catholic at the time of marriage. The disqualification by marrying a Catholic was removed by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013. 

The couple have three living children:

* George, Earl of St Andrews, born 26 June 1962 at Coppins; married Sylvana Tomaselli
* Lady Helen Taylor, born 28 April 1964 at Coppins; married Timothy Taylor
* Lord Nicholas Windsor, born 25 July 1970 at King&#x27;s College Hospital in London; married, 2006, Paola Doimi de Lupis de Frankopan

Katharine had a miscarriage in 1975 owing to rubella and gave birth to a stillborn son, Patrick, in 1977.

The Duke and Duchess of Kent reside at Wren House, Kensington Palace, in London.

In 2011, close associates of Jonathan Rees, a private investigator connected to the &quot;News International&quot; phone hacking scandal, stated that he had penetrated Edward and Katharine&#x27;s bank accounts.

The Duke had a mild stroke on the morning of 18 March 2013. In April 2015, he suffered from a hip injury and was hospitalised at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for further treatments.

==Activities==

The Duke of Kent performed engagements on behalf of his cousin, the Queen, for over 50 years. The Duke represented the Queen during independence celebrations in the Commonwealth countries of Sierra Leone, Uganda, Guyana, Gambia, and Ghana, to commemorate its 50th independence anniversary celebration. He also acted as Counsellor of State during periods of the Queen&#x27;s absence abroad.

One of the Duke&#x27;s major public roles for many years was vice-chairman of British Trade International, formerly known as the British Overseas Trade Board, and later as the United Kingdom&#x27;s Special Representative for International Trade and Investment. This position saw the Duke travel abroad to represent the British government in fostering trade relations with foreign countries and organisations. Prince Andrew, Duke of York succeeded him in this position, which is today known as UK Trade &amp; Investment (or UKTI), although Prince Andrew resigned from the post in 2011. He was also the vice-chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board. In that capacity, he became the first member of the royal family to visit China in 1979 with his focus being on the British Energy Exhibition in Beijing.

From 1971 to 2000, the Duke of Kent was president of English football&#x27;s governing body, The Football Association. The Duke has served as the president of The Scout Association since 1975. 
Along with Prince William of Wales, the Duke visited the Centenary World Scout Jamboree at Hylands Park, Chelmsford in July 2007. He also served as the president of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club between 1969 and 2021, a position in which he succeeded his late mother, Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent. He was also president of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission from 1970 until 2023. His other roles include president of the RAF Benevolent Fund, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the Stroke Association, the Royal United Services Institute, the Royal Institution, the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club, and patron of the American Air Museum in Britain, Royal West Norfolk Golf Club, Kent County Cricket Club, Opera North, and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance. He is also on the advisory panel for the Mountbatten Medal and presents the medal once the decision has been made. The Duke of Kent is one of the Royal Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

For almost 29 years, the Duke has been the patron of Endeavour, a national youth organisation. He has also served as Royal Patron of The Honourable Society of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn since 2001, a position previously occupied by his father. In 2015, the Duke received the Dresden Peace Prize for &quot;his contribution to British-German reconciliation.&quot;

On 2 June 2022, the Duke appeared alongside the Queen on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the 2022 Trooping the Colour as part of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations.

Upon the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the Duke of Kent became the oldest living descendant of King George V, and the last surviving descendant born in George V&#x27;s lifetime.

The Duke was colonel of the Scots Guards for fifty years from 9 September 1974 to 14 April 2024, being succeeded by the Duke of Edinburgh. At the time of his retirement, he was the regiment&#x27;s longest serving colonel.

==Freemasonry==
The Duke was initiated into Royal Alpha Lodge No. 16 on 16 December 1963, and was elected its Worshipful Master for 1965 and 1966.

Having been appointed Senior Grand Warden in 1966, he was elected as Grand Master the following year, and was installed on 14 June 1967 during United Grand Lodge of England&#x27;s 250th anniversary celebrations at the Royal Albert Hall. He is the 10th, and longest-serving Grand Master of UGLE, the governing body of Freemasonry in England and Wales.

In December 2013, the Duke celebrated 50 years as a freemason. In October 2017 he presided over the tercentenary celebrations of UGLE, marking the 300th anniversary of the founding of the original Grand Lodge, one of two which merged to form UGLE in 1813. The main ceremony was held in the Royal Albert Hall, in the year which also marked the Duke&#x27;s 50th anniversary of installation as Grand Master.

<text>Truman &quot;Mark&quot; Herron (July 8, 1928 – January 13, 1996) was an American actor and the fourth husband of singer and actress Judy Garland. They were married on November 14, 1965, in Las Vegas, Nevada, but they separated after five months of marriage. Seventeen months later, Garland was granted a divorce after testifying that Herron had beaten her. He said he had &quot;only hit her in self-defense.&quot;

Herron appeared in films such as Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; (1963), &quot;Girl in Gold Boots&quot; (1968) and &quot;Eye of the Cat&quot; (1969).

He also appeared on the TV western series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in 1960 as an Army Major in the S5E38&#x27;s &quot;The Deserter&quot;.

Gerald Clarke, in his biography of Garland, &quot;Get Happy,&quot; and in an interview about the book, reported that Herron had an affair with Tallulah Bankhead, prior to meeting Garland.

Garland put Herron to work as producer of her two London Palladium concerts with her daughter Liza Minnelli in 1964, as well as some appearances in Canada in 1965.

Aside from providing Gerold Frank information for his 1975 biography &quot;Judy&quot;, Herron remained silent on the topic of Garland. He continued acting, often appearing in summer stock productions.

Herron had a long-lasting relationship with fellow actor Henry Brandon, which was only briefly interrupted by his marriage to Garland. The two men remained together until Brandon&#x27;s death in 1990.

<text>In frequentist statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is an interval which is expected to contain the parameter being estimated. More specifically, a CI is a random interval which contains the parameter being estimated at a given percentage of the time (under replication). The percentage, denoted formula_1 (95% and 99% are typical values), is a coverage probability, called confidence level, degree of confidence or confidence coefficient; it represents the long-run proportion of CIs (at the given confidence level) that contain the true value of the parameter. For example, out of all intervals computed at the 95% level, 95% of them should contain the parameter&#x27;s true value. Sometimes one has to make do with approximations, hence the confidence level is only approximate

Factors affecting the width of the CI include the sample size, the variability in the sample, and the confidence level. All else being the same, a larger sample produces a narrower confidence interval, greater variability in the sample produces a wider confidence interval, and a higher confidence level produces a wider confidence interval.
== History ==
Methods for calculating confidence intervals for the binomial proportion appeared from the 1920s. The main ideas of confidence intervals in general were developed in the early 1930s, and the first thorough and general account was given by Jerzy Neyman in 1937. 

Neyman described the development of the ideas as follows (reference numbers have been changed):
[My work on confidence intervals] originated about 1930 from a simple question of Waclaw Pytkowski, then my student in Warsaw, engaged in an empirical study in farm economics. The question was: how to characterize non-dogmatically the precision of an estimated regression coefficient? ...

Pytkowski&#x27;s monograph ... appeared in print in 1932. It so happened that, somewhat earlier, Fisher published his first paper concerned with fiducial distributions and fiducial argument. Quite unexpectedly, while the conceptual framework of fiducial argument is entirely different from that of confidence intervals, the specific solutions of several particular problems coincided. Thus, in the first paper in which I presented the theory of confidence intervals, published in 1934, I recognized Fisher&#x27;s priority for the idea that interval estimation is possible without any reference to Bayes&#x27; theorem and with the solution being independent from probabilities &quot;a priori&quot;. At the same time I mildly suggested that Fisher&#x27;s approach to the problem involved a minor misunderstanding.
In medical journals, confidence intervals were promoted in the 1970s but only became widely used in the 1980s. By 1988, medical journals were requiring the reporting of confidence intervals.

== Definition ==
Let formula_2 be a random sample from a probability distribution with statistical parameter formula_3, where formula_4 is a quantity to be estimated and formula_5 represents further quantities which together with formula_4 determine the probability distribution of the sample, if present, but which are not of immediate interest. A confidence interval for the parameter formula_4, with confidence level or coefficient formula_1, is an interval formula_9 determined by random variables formula_10 and formula_11 with the property:
: formula_12

The number formula_1, whose typical value is close to but not greater than 1, is sometimes given in the form formula_14 (or as a percentage formula_15), where formula_16 is a small positive number, often 0.05.

By definition, the bounds formula_10 and formula_11 are to be constructed in such a way that as long as formula_2 is collected randomly, i.e. the model assumption about its probability distribution is satisfied, and we then compute a confidence interval, there will be probability formula_1 that it will contain formula_4, the true value of the parameter being estimated. This should hold true for any actual formula_4 and formula_5.

=== Approximate confidence intervals ===
In many applications, confidence intervals that have exactly the required confidence level are hard to construct, but approximate intervals can be computed. The rule for constructing the interval may be accepted as providing a confidence interval at level formula_1 if

: formula_25

to an acceptable level of approximation. Alternatively, some authors simply require that

: formula_26

which is useful if the probabilities are only partially identified or imprecise, and also when dealing with discrete distributions. Confidence limits of the form

: formula_27   and   formula_28

are called &quot;conservative&quot;; accordingly, one speaks of conservative confidence intervals and, in general, regions.

=== Desired properties ===
When applying standard statistical procedures, there will often be standard ways of constructing confidence intervals. These will have been devised so as to meet certain desirable properties, which will hold given that the assumptions on which the procedure relies are true. These desirable properties may be described as: validity, optimality, and invariance.

Of the three, &quot;validity&quot; is most important, followed closely by &quot;optimality&quot;. &quot;Invariance&quot; may be considered as a property of the method of derivation of a confidence interval, rather than of the rule for constructing the interval. In non-standard applications, these same desirable properties would be sought:

==== Validity ====
This means that the nominal coverage probability (confidence level) of the confidence interval should hold, either exactly or to a good approximation.

==== Optimality ====
This means that the rule for constructing the confidence interval should make as much use of the information in the data-set as possible.

One way of assessing optimality is by the width of the interval so that a rule for constructing a confidence interval is judged better than another if it leads to intervals whose widths are typically shorter.

==== Invariance ====
In many applications, the quantity being estimated might not be tightly defined as such.

For example, a survey might result in an estimate of the median income in a population, but it might equally be considered as providing an estimate of the logarithm of the median income, given that this is a common scale for presenting graphical results. It would be desirable that the method used for constructing a confidence interval for the median income would give equivalent results when applied to constructing a confidence interval for the logarithm of the median income: Specifically the values at the ends of the latter interval would be the logarithms of the values at the ends of former interval.

=== Methods of derivation ===
For non-standard applications, there are several routes that might be taken to derive a rule for the construction of confidence intervals. Established rules for standard procedures might be justified or explained via several of these routes. Typically a rule for constructing confidence intervals is closely tied to a particular way of finding a point estimate of the quantity being considered.

==== Summary statistics ====

This is closely related to the method of moments for estimation. A simple example arises where the quantity to be estimated is the population mean, in which case a natural estimate is the sample mean. Similarly, the sample variance can be used to estimate the population variance. A confidence interval for the true mean can be constructed centered on the sample mean with a width which is a multiple of the square root of the sample variance.

==== Likelihood theory ====
Estimates can be constructed using the maximum likelihood principle, the likelihood theory for this provides two ways of constructing confidence intervals or confidence regions for the estimates.

==== Estimating equations ====
The estimation approach here can be considered as both a generalization of the method of moments and a generalization of the maximum likelihood approach. There are corresponding generalizations of the results of maximum likelihood theory that allow confidence intervals to be constructed based on estimates derived from estimating equations.

==== Hypothesis testing ====
If hypothesis tests are available for general values of a parameter, then confidence intervals/regions can be constructed by including in the confidence region all those points for which the hypothesis test of the null hypothesis that the true value is the given value is not rejected at a significance level of 

==== Bootstrapping ====

In situations where the distributional assumptions for the above methods are uncertain or violated, resampling methods allow construction of confidence intervals or prediction intervals. The observed data distribution and the internal correlations are used as the surrogate for the correlations in the wider population.

==== Central limit theorem ====

The central limit theorem is a refinement of the law of large numbers. For a large number of independent identically distributed random variables formula_29 with finite variance, the average formula_30 approximately has a normal distribution, no matter what the distribution of the formula_31 is, with the approximation roughly improving in proportion to formula_32.

== Example ==
Suppose formula_33 is an independent sample from a normally distributed population with unknown parameters mean formula_34 and variance formula_35 Let

: formula_36

: formula_37

Where formula_38 is the sample mean, and formula_39 is the unbiased sample variance. Then

: formula_40

has a Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot; distribution with formula_41 degrees of freedom. Note that the distribution of formula_42 does not depend on the values of the unobservable parameters formula_34 and formula_44; i.e., it is a pivotal quantity. Suppose we wanted to calculate a 95% confidence interval for formula_45 Then, denoting formula_46 as the 97.5th percentile of this distribution,

: formula_47

Note that &quot;97.5th&quot; and &quot;0.95&quot; are correct in the preceding expressions. There is a 2.5% chance that formula_42 will be less than formula_49 and a 2.5% chance that it will be larger than formula_50 Thus, the probability that formula_42 will be between formula_49 and formula_53 is 95%. formula_54 is the probability measure under the student formula_55 distribution.

Consequently,

: formula_56

and we have a theoretical (stochastic) 95% confidence interval for formula_45 Here formula_58 is the probability measure under unknown distribution of formula_34.

After observing the sample, we find values formula_60 for formula_38 and formula_62 for formula_63 from which we compute the confidence interval

: formula_64

== Interpretation ==
Various interpretations of a confidence interval can be given (taking the 95% confidence interval as an example in the following).
* The confidence interval can be expressed in terms of a long-run frequency in repeated samples (or in resampling): &quot;Were this procedure to be repeated on numerous samples, the proportion of calculated 95% confidence intervals that encompassed the true value of the population parameter would tend toward 95%.&quot;
* The confidence interval can be expressed in terms of probability with respect to a single theoretical (yet to be realized) sample: &quot;There is a 95% probability that the 95% confidence interval calculated from a given future sample will cover the true value of the population parameter.&quot; This essentially reframes the &quot;repeated samples&quot; interpretation as a probability rather than a frequency. 
* The confidence interval can be expressed in terms of statistical significance, e.g.: &quot;The 95% confidence interval represents values that are not statistically significantly different from the point estimate at the .05 level.&quot;
=== Common misunderstandings ===

Confidence intervals and levels are frequently misunderstood, and published studies have shown that even professional scientists often misinterpret them.

* A 95% confidence level does not mean that for a given realized interval there is a 95% probability that the population parameter lies within the interval (i.e., a 95% probability that the interval covers the population parameter). According to the frequentist interpretation, once an interval is calculated, this interval either covers the parameter value or it does not; it is no longer a matter of probability. The 95% probability relates to the reliability of the estimation procedure, not to a specific calculated interval. Neyman himself (the original proponent of confidence intervals) made this point in his original paper:It will be noticed that in the above description, the probability statements refer to the problems of estimation with which the statistician will be concerned in the future. In fact, I have repeatedly stated that the frequency of correct results will tend to &quot;α&quot;. Consider now the case when a sample is already drawn, and the calculations have given [particular limits]. Can we say that in this particular case the probability of the true value [falling between these limits] is equal to &quot;α&quot;? The answer is obviously in the negative. The parameter is an unknown constant, and no probability statement concerning its value may be made...

* A 95% confidence level does not mean that 95% of the sample data lie within the confidence interval.
* A 95% confidence level does not mean that there is a 95% probability of the parameter estimate from a repeat of the experiment falling within the confidence interval computed from a given experiment.

=== Examples of how naïve interpretation of confidence intervals can be problematic ===

==== Confidence procedure for uniform location ====
Welch presented an example which clearly shows the difference between the theory of confidence intervals and other theories of interval estimation (including Fisher&#x27;s fiducial intervals and objective Bayesian intervals). Robinson called this example &quot;[p]ossibly the best known counterexample for Neyman&#x27;s version of confidence interval theory.&quot; To Welch, it showed the superiority of confidence interval theory; to critics of the theory, it shows a deficiency. Here we present a simplified version.

Suppose that formula_65 are independent observations from a uniform formula_66 distribution. Then the optimal 50% confidence procedure for formula_4 is

: formula_68

A fiducial or objective Bayesian argument can be used to derive the interval estimate
: formula_69
which is also a 50% confidence procedure. Welch showed that the first confidence procedure dominates the second, according to desiderata from confidence interval theory; for every formula_70, the probability that the first procedure contains formula_71 is &quot;less than or equal to&quot; the probability that the second procedure contains formula_71. The average width of the intervals from the first procedure is less than that of the second. Hence, the first procedure is preferred under classical confidence interval theory.

However, when formula_73, intervals from the first procedure are &quot;guaranteed&quot; to contain the true value formula_4: Therefore, the nominal 50% confidence coefficient is unrelated to the uncertainty we should have that a specific interval contains the true value. The second procedure does not have this property.

Moreover, when the first procedure generates a very short interval, this indicates that formula_65 are very close together and hence only offer the information in a single data point. Yet the first interval will exclude almost all reasonable values of the parameter due to its short width. The second procedure does not have this property.

The two counter-intuitive properties of the first procedure – 100% coverage when formula_65 are far apart and almost 0% coverage when formula_65 are close together – balance out to yield 50% coverage on average. However, despite the first procedure being optimal, its intervals offer neither an assessment of the precision of the estimate nor an assessment of the uncertainty one should have that the interval contains the true value.

This example is used to argue against naïve interpretations of confidence intervals. If a confidence procedure is asserted to have properties beyond that of the nominal coverage (such as relation to precision, or a relationship with Bayesian inference), those properties must be proved; they do not follow from the fact that a procedure is a confidence procedure.

==== Confidence procedure for &quot;ω&quot;2 ====
Steiger suggested a number of confidence procedures for common effect size measures in ANOVA. Morey et al. point out that several of these confidence procedures, including the one for &quot;ω&quot;2, have the property that as the &quot;F&quot; statistic becomes increasingly small—indicating misfit with all possible values of &quot;ω&quot;2—the confidence interval shrinks and can even contain only the single value &quot;ω&quot;2 = 0; that is, the CI is infinitesimally narrow (this occurs when formula_78 for a formula_79 CI).

This behavior is consistent with the relationship between the confidence procedure and significance testing: as &quot;F&quot; becomes so small that the group means are much closer together than we would expect by chance, a significance test might indicate rejection for most or all values of &quot;ω&quot;2. Hence the interval will be very narrow or even empty (or, by a convention suggested by Steiger, containing only 0). However, this does &quot;not&quot; indicate that the estimate of &quot;ω&quot;2 is very precise. In a sense, it indicates the opposite: that the trustworthiness of the results themselves may be in doubt. This is contrary to the common interpretation of confidence intervals that they reveal the precision of the estimate.

<doc id="280916" wikidata="Q937852" url="?curid=280916" title="David Rose (songwriter)">
<text>David Daniel Rose (June 15, 1910 – August 23, 1990) was a British-born American songwriter, composer, arranger, pianist, and orchestra leader. His best known compositions were &quot;The Stripper&quot;, &quot;Holiday for Strings&quot;, and &quot;Calypso Melody&quot;. He also wrote music for many television series, including &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Life&quot;, &quot;The Tony Martin Show&quot;, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, and &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;, some under the pseudonym Ray Llewellyn.

Rose&#x27;s work as a composer for television programs earned him four Emmys. In addition, he was musical director for &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; during its 21-year run on the CBS and NBC networks. He was a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music.

==Career==
Rose was born in London, England, to Jewish parents, and raised in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The family name was originally Rosenberg. Rose&#x27;s career in music began when he worked with Ted Fio Rito&#x27;s band when he was sixteen. Rose also worked as a standby pianist for NBC Radio. It was there, in the early 1930s, that he first gained a reputation, while arranging for the Frank Trumbauer orchestra, and later leading a house band at station WGN.

He composed several early swing originals, such as &quot;Break It Down&quot;, with Frankie Trumbauer, &quot;Transcontinental,&quot; &quot;Plantation Moods,&quot; and a piece recorded under three different titles: &quot;I&#x27;ve Got It&quot;, &quot;Itchola&quot;, and &quot;Jigsaw Rhythm&quot;, his original version with the WGN band including Louis Prima.

===Radio===
Rose was asked to work in Hollywood, where he formed his orchestra, doing a twice-weekly radio show for Mutual Broadcasting System called &quot;California Melodies&quot;, writing all the broadcast arrangements. He worked his way up to becoming music director of the Mutual network. Rose&#x27;s first try at composing was his hit song &quot;Holiday for Strings&quot;. During World War II, Rose entered the Army, first meeting Red Skelton while both were enlisted. Skelton asked Rose to become the conductor for his &quot;Raleigh Cigarette Program&quot;. Rose joined the cast in 1948 and worked with Skelton on his television show for over 20 years.

In 1942, Rose and his orchestra provided the music for &quot;Tune Up, America!&quot; on Mutual. The program provided &quot;recognition of the efforts of women engaged in war work&quot;.

===Recording===
In 1955, Rose was commissioned by MGM Studios to compose the score for their forthcoming science fiction project &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;. The music was completed and recorded and, based on the surviving track, it combined conventional instrumentation with some electronic elements. Rose was discharged from the project at the end of 1955 after the producers heard the electronic music of Louis and Bebe Barron and hired them to provide the final all-electronic soundtrack. A 7&quot; single of Rose&#x27;s unused theme from the film, backed by Bronislaw Kaper&#x27;s theme for the MGM film &quot;The Swan&quot; (1956), was released during 1956 on MGM Records on which it was credited as being &quot;inspired&quot; by the film. Reportedly, Rose later destroyed all the original session recordings of his &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; music.

In 1957, his rendition of Larry Clinton&#x27;s &quot;Calypso Melody&quot; became Rose&#x27;s second million-selling record and was awarded a gold disc.

&quot;The Stripper&quot;, released in 1962, was composed by Rose in 1958 for a television special saluting burlesque. The song featured especially prominent trombone lines, giving the tune its lascivious signature, evoking the feel of music used to accompany burlesque striptease artists. Four years after the song was recorded, MGM Records wanted to rush-release Rose&#x27;s recording of &quot;Ebb Tide&quot; as a 45-rpm single but needed a B-side. An office boy perused Rose&#x27;s tapes searching for one, and &quot;The Stripper&quot; was chosen. It became a surprise hit, receiving considerable radio play.

&quot;Holiday for Strings&quot; became well known as the theme for Red Skelton&#x27;s programs. A parody version, retitled &quot;Holiday for States&quot;, was recorded as a vocal by Allan Sherman, with the straight melody but with ersatz lyrics consisting of the names of American states.

==Personal life==

Rose was married on October 8, 1938, to actress Martha Raye. The couple divorced on May 19, 1941.

Rose married for a second time, on July 28, 1941, to actress and singer Judy Garland. They had no children, though Garland, according to biographer Gerald Clarke, underwent at least one abortion during the marriage, at the insistence of her mother, her husband, and her motion picture studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Garland and Rose divorced in 1944.

He had two daughters with his third wife, Betty Bartholomew (m. 1948 until his death in 1990). His granddaughter is singer-songwriter Samantha James.

Rose was a live steam hobbyist, with his own backyard railroad.

==Death==
Rose died of a heart attack in Burbank, California, at the age of 80. He was buried in Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Hollywood Hills, California.

<text>Fernand Paul Achille Braudel (; 24 August 1902 – 27 November 1985) was a French historian. His scholarship focused on three main projects: &quot;The Mediterranean&quot; (1923–49, then 1949–66), &quot;Civilization and Capitalism&quot; (1955–79), and the unfinished &quot;Identity of France&quot; (1970–85). He was a member of the Annales School of French historiography and social history in the 1950s and 1960s.

Braudel emphasized the role of large-scale socioeconomic factors in the making and writing of history. In a 2011 poll by &quot;History Today&quot; magazine, he was named the most important historian of the previous 60 years.

==Biography==
Braudel was born in Luméville-en-Ornois in the département of the Meuse, France. He grew up in a pre-industrial rural setting with his grandmother until at the age of seven he joined his father in Paris. His father, a mathematics teacher, aided him in his studies. His maternal grandfather had been a Communard, and Braudel was reluctant to mention this side of his family.

Braudel was educated at the Lycée Voltaire (1913–20), where he studied Latin and Greek, and at the Sorbonne, where he was taught by Henri Hauser and gained an &quot;agrégation&quot; in history in 1923. He taught at a &quot;lycée&quot; in Constantine in French Algeria in 1923/24, where he met his future second wife, Paule Pradel, and then at the University of Algiers until 1932, with a break for military service in the French Army of the Rhine in 1925/26. While in Algeria, he became fascinated by the Mediterranean Sea and wrote a paper on the Spanish presence in the country during the 16th century. He also began there his doctoral thesis on the foreign policy of King Philip II of Spain (), with archival research at the General Archive of Simancas in the summer of 1927. He visited several archives around the Mediterranean, including at Venice, and finally Dubrovnik in 1936/37, and microfilmed documents with the help of his wife. From 1932 to 1935 he taught in the Paris &quot;lycées&quot; (secondary schools) of Pasteur, Condorcet and Henri-IV. During this period he first met Lucien Febvre, the co-founder of the &quot;Annales&quot; journal (1929).

By 1900, the French had solidified their cultural influence in Brazil by the establishment of the Brazilian Academy of Fine Arts. São Paulo still lacked a university, however, and in 1934, the francophile Julio de Mesquita Filho invited the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss and Braudel to help develop one. The result was the establishment of the new University of São Paulo on 25 January 1934. Braudel left for Brazil in March 1935, after the birth of his daughter, and took up the post vacated by Émile Coornaert. He worked within the state-promoted ideological framework of Pan-Latinism, part of the French civilizing mission, and helped the São Paulo elites in their project of achieving social and national hegemony. His colleagues included João Cruz Costa, Roberto Simonsen and Caio Prado Júnior. The evening lectures of French professors were attended by the city governor Armando de Sales Oliveira and Marshal Cândido Rondon. Braudel made use of his stay for intellectual experimentation and he later said that the time in Brazil had been the &quot;greatest period of his life&quot;. Braudel was fascinated with Sao Paulo&#x27;s rapid vertical growth in the early Vargas Era and noted the Paulista academics&#x27; claims that &quot;there is no social question&quot; in the new world. Unlike Lévi-Strauss, he did not actively support the Communist-backed National Liberation Alliance, but took a more centrist position. He compared Brazil favourably – on account of its &quot;social malleability&quot; and tabula rasa development as a &quot;young European civilization&quot; – to Algeria and even to the United States in his 1937 &quot;The Concept of a New Country&quot;. He would later call Algeria, with its &quot;uneducable&quot; population, &quot;a failed Brazil&quot;.

In 1937, Braudel returned to Paris from Brazil. He spent the twenty-day sea journey in the company of Febvre and his family as both had booked passage on the same ship. Braudel thus fell under the influence of the &quot;Annales&quot; School. In 1938 he entered the as an instructor in history. He worked with Febvre, who would later read the early versions of Braudel&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; and provide him with editorial advice. He started writing his book on Philip II&#x27;s Mediterranean at Febvre&#x27;s house in the Juras. He only took a stance on current politics when expressing condemnation of the Munich Agreement in 1938.

At the outbreak of war in 1939, he was called up for military service and on 29 June 1940 taken prisoner as lieutenant in the 156th Infantry Regiment by the Germans in the Vosges. He was initially held at a prisoner-of-war camp in Neuf-Brisach and then in the Oflag XII-B in the citadel of Mainz. In Mainz, he became the rector of the camp university, which gained him respectful treatment (per &quot;Magnifizenz&quot;) from the camp authorities and the right to borrow books and journals from the well-provisioned municipal library for his research. Under the Geneva Convention he received his pay, which he used to buy German books (e.g. the works of Werner Sombart and Max Weber), and was able to order material from France, including the full collection of the &quot;Annales&quot;. In June 1942, suspected of &quot;Gaullist&quot; (i.e. French Resistance) involvement, he was transferred to a camp for special category prisoners (Oflag X-C) near Lübeck, where he remained for the rest of the war. In the camp, he befriended some Catholic clerics and the historian . Braudel drafted his great work (&quot;&quot;) without access to his personal collection of books and notes, which forced him to rely in that regard on his prodigious memory. According to his own account, the long-time perspective he took was in part a &quot;direct existential&quot; reaction to the troubling war news. By &quot;choosing the position of God the Father himself as a refuge&quot; he sought to assert the &quot;perdurability and majestic immobility&quot; of the Mediterranean against the &quot;fleeting occurrence&quot; of political events which he associated with the &quot;daily misery&quot; of the camp. He sent completed copy books to Febvre in Paris, first apparently through the International Red Cross, and after obtaining written authorisation from the OKW in November 1942 via the German embassy in Paris. He occasionally dispatched books to Febvre as well. He edited his work after his release in 1945 by checking it against the archival material that survived the war in a metal container in the basement of his Paris house. He cut portions from the copy books and re-arranged the text with new insertions, then destroyed the manuscripts – only a fragment gifted to Febvre has survived. During the war, his wife and children lived in Algeria.

Braudel became the leader of the second generation of &quot;Annales&quot; historians after 1945. He defended his thesis at the University of Paris in 1947. In that year, with Febvre and , he obtained funding from the French government and the Rockefeller Foundation (which had previously supported the wartime exile École libre des hautes études in New York) to set up the &quot;&quot; for economic and social sciences at the (EPHE), which then became the funnel for all historical research in France. In 1948, the &quot;Centre de recherches historiques&quot; was established there, with Braudel as its director. In 1949 he was elected by the professors of the Collège de France as one of their number upon Febvre&#x27;s retirement. He co-founded the academic journal , in 1950. He became the head of the &quot;Sixième section&quot; at EPHE after the death of Febvre in 1956 and attracted scholars such as Roland Barthes and Jacques Lacan to join its activities. He became the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Annales&quot; in 1957, which completed his rise to unrivalled influence on the development of the historical studies in France in the post-war years. He received an additional $1 million from the Ford Foundation in 1960.

In 1962, he and Gaston Berger used the Ford Foundation grant and government funds to create a new independent foundation, the &quot;&quot; (FMSH), which Braudel directed from 1970 to his death. It was housed in the building called . FMSH focused its activities on international networking in order to disseminate the &quot;Annales&quot; approach to the rest of Europe and to the world. In 1972 Braudel gave up all editorial responsibility on the &quot;Annales&quot; journal, but his name remained on the masthead.

In 1962 Braudel wrote &quot;A History of Civilizations&quot; as the basis for a history course, but its rejection of the traditional event-based narrative was too radical for the French Ministry of Education, which in turn rejected it.

He retired in 1968. In 1975, the &quot;Sixième section&quot; was transformed into School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences, a public institution of higher education in its own right. In 1984 he was elected to the and his introduction speech was given by Maurice Druon.

==&quot;La Méditerranée&quot;==
His first book, &quot;La Méditerranée et le monde méditerranéen à l&#x27;époque de Philippe II&quot; (1949) (&quot;The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II&quot;) was his most influential and has been described as a &quot;watershed&quot;.

For Braudel there is no single Mediterranean Sea. There are many seas, indeed a &quot;vast, complex expanse&quot; within which men operate. Life is conducted on the Mediterranean: people travel, fish, fight wars, and drown in its various contexts, and the sea articulates with the plains and islands. Life on the plains is diverse and complex; the poorer south is affected by religious diversity (Catholicism and Islam), as well as by intrusions, both cultural and economic, from the north. In other words, the Mediterranean cannot be understood independently from what is exterior to it. Any rigid adherence to boundaries falsifies the situation.

The first level of time, geographical time, is that of the environment, with its slow, almost imperceptible change, its repetition and cycles. Such change may be slow, but it is irresistible. The second level of time comprises long-term social, economic, and cultural history, where Braudel discusses the Mediterranean economy, social groupings, empires and civilizations. Change at that level is much more rapid than that of the environment. Braudel looks at two or three centuries to spot a particular pattern such as the rise and fall of various aristocracies. The third level of time is that of events (&quot;histoire événementielle&quot;). This is the history of individuals with names. That, for Braudel, is the time of surfaces and deceptive effects. It is the time of the &quot;courte durée&quot; proper and the focus of Part 3 of &quot;The Mediterranean&quot;, which treats of &quot;events, politics and people.&quot;

Braudel&#x27;s Mediterranean is centered on the sea, but just as importantly, it is also the desert and the mountains. The desert creates a nomadic form of social organization where the whole community moves; mountain life is sedentary. Transhumance the movement from the mountain to the plain or vice versa in a given season is also a persistent part of Mediterranean existence.

Braudel&#x27;s vast panoramic view used insights from other social sciences, employed the concept of the &quot;longue durée&quot;, and downplayed the importance of specific events. It was widely admired, but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs. The book firmly launched the study of the Mediterranean and dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the &quot;Annales School.&quot;

In the 1966 second edition to his book, which went further in the direction of seeking scientific precision through economic quantification, Braudel claimed that over the previous twenty to thirty years &quot;the chain of economic events and their short-term conjunctures&quot; had been established as a less obvious alternative to the traditional &quot;chain of political events&quot;.

The second edition appeared in 70,000 copies, in contrast to 2,500 copies of the first edition. It was only with the publishing of the English translation of the second edition of his book that Braudel&#x27;s work began to make an impact on Anglophone scholarship.

==Capitalism==
After &quot;La Méditerranée&quot;, Braudel&#x27;s most famous work is &quot;Civilisation Matérielle, Économie et Capitalisme, XVe-XVIIIe&quot; (&quot;Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century&quot;). The first volume was published in 1967 and was translated to English in 1973. The last of the three-volume work appeared in 1979. The work is a broad-scale history of the pre-industrial modern world focusing on how regular people made economies work. Like all of Braudel&#x27;s other major works, it mixes traditional economic material with thick description of the social impact of economic events on various facets of everyday life, including food, fashion and other social customs.

The third volume, subtitled &quot;The Perspective of the World&quot;, was strongly influenced by the work of German scholars like Werner Sombart. In it, Braudel traces the impact of the centers of Western capitalism on the rest of the world. Braudel wrote the series as a way of explanation for the modern way and partly as a refutation of the Marxist view of history.

Braudel discussed the idea of long-term cycles in the capitalist economy that he saw developing in Europe in the 12th century. Particular cities and later nation-states follow each other sequentially as centres of these cycles: Venice in the 13th through the 15th centuries (1250–1510); Antwerp and Genoa in the 16th century (1500–1569 and 1557–1627, respectively), Amsterdam in the 16th through 18th centuries (1627–1733); and London (and England) in the 18th and 19th centuries (1733–1896). He used the word &quot;structures&quot; to denote a variety of social structures, such as organized behaviours, attitudes, and conventions, as well as physical structures and infrastructures. He argued that the structures established in Europe during the Middle Ages contributed to the successes of present-day European-based cultures. He attributed much of that to the long-standing independence of city-states, which, though later subjugated by larger geographic states, were not always completely suppressed, probably for reasons of utility.

Braudel argues that capitalists have typically been monopolists and not, as is usually assumed, entrepreneurs operating in competitive markets. He argued that capitalists did not specialize and did not use free markets, and he thus diverges from both liberal (Adam Smith) and Marxian interpretations. In Braudel&#x27;s view, the state in capitalist countries has served as a guarantor of monopolists rather than a protector of competition, as it is usually portrayed. He asserted that capitalists have had power and cunning on their side, as they have arrayed themselves against the majority of the population.

An agrarian structure is a long-term structure in the Braudelian understanding of the concept. On a larger scale the agrarian structure is more dependent on the regional, social, cultural and historical factors than on the state&#x27;s undertaken activities.

==&quot;L&#x27;Identité de la France&quot;==
Braudel&#x27;s last and most personal book was &quot;L&#x27;Identité de la France&quot; (&quot;The Identity of France&quot;), which was unfinished at the time of his death in 1985. Unlike in many of Braudel&#x27;s other books, he makes no secret of his profound love of his country in this book and remarks at the beginning that he had loved France as if she were a woman. Reflecting his interest with the &quot;longue durée&quot;, Braudel&#x27;s concern in &quot;L&#x27;Identité de la France&quot; was with the centuries and millennia, instead of the years and decades. Braudel argued that France is the product not of its politics or economics but rather of its geography and culture, a thesis that Braudel had explored in a wide-ranging book that saw the &quot;bourg&quot; and the &quot;patois: histoire totale&quot; integrated into a broad sweep of both the place and the time.

&quot;L&#x27;Identité de la France&quot; was much coloured by a romantic nostalgia, as Braudel argued for the existence of a &quot;France profonde&quot;, a &quot;deep France&quot; based upon the peasant &quot;mentalité&quot;, which despite all of the turmoil of French history and the Industrial Revolution, has survived intact right up to the present.

In this book, he expressed a conviction that economics is &quot;the most scientific of the sciences of man&quot;, while history is merely an imperfect one.

==Historiography==
According to Braudel, before the &quot;Annales&quot; approach, the writing of history was focused on the &quot;courte durée&quot; (short span), or on &quot;histoire événementielle&quot; (a history of events). 

His followers admired his use of the &quot;longue durée&quot; approach to stress the slow and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past. The &quot;Annales&quot; historians, after living through two world wars and massive political upheavals in France, were very uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the &quot;longue durée&quot;, arguing that the continuities in the deepest structures of society were central to history. Upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history, they argued, lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions. A proponent of historical materialism himself, Braudel rejected Marxist dialectical, stressing the equal importance of infrastructure and superstructure, both of which reflected enduring social, economic, and cultural realities. Braudel&#x27;s structures, both mental and environmental, determine the long-term course of events by constraining actions on, and by, humans over a duration long enough that they are beyond the consciousness of the actors involved.

A feature of Braudel&#x27;s work was his compassion for the suffering of marginal people. He articulated the view that most surviving historical sources come from the literate wealthy classes. He emphasised the importance of the ephemeral lives of slaves, serfs, peasants and the urban poor, and demonstrated their contributions to the wealth and power of their respective masters and societies. His work was often illustrated with contemporary depictions of daily life and rarely with pictures of noblemen or kings. He chose to emphasise constraints on human agency – as J. H. Elliott noted in a review of his first book, &quot;Braudel&#x27;s Mediterranean is a world unresponsive to human control&quot; so that &quot;Braudel&#x27;s mountains move his men, but never his men the mountains&quot;. This preference for objective explanations at the expense of human decisions could lead Braudel towards dubious conclusions, as when he asserted that overpopulation was the principal reason for the expulsion of Jews from Spain, Portugal and Sicily at the turn of the fifteenth century.

Braudel is considered a precursor of the world-systems theory.

<doc id="280926" wikidata="Q327547" url="?curid=280926" title="Cool jazz">
<text>Cool jazz is a style of modern jazz music inspired by bebop and big band that arose in the United States after World War II. It is characterized by relaxed tempos and a lighter tone than that used in the fast and complex bebop style. Cool jazz often employs formal arrangements and incorporates elements of classical music. Broadly, the genre refers to a number of post-war jazz styles employing a more subdued approach than that of contemporaneous jazz idioms. As Paul Tanner, Maurice Gerow, and David Megill suggest, &quot;the tonal sonorities of these conservative players could be compared to pastel colors, while the solos of [Dizzy] Gillespie and his followers could be compared to fiery red colors.&quot;

The term &quot;cool&quot; started being applied to this music around 1953, when Capitol Records released the album &quot;Classics in Jazz: Cool and Quiet&quot;. Mark C. Gridley, writing in the &quot;All Music Guide to Jazz&quot;, identifies four overlapping sub-categories of cool jazz:

# &quot;Soft variants of bebop,&quot; including the Miles Davis recordings that constitute &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;; the complete works of the Modern Jazz Quartet; the output of Gerry Mulligan, especially his work with Chet Baker and Bob Brookmeyer; the music of Stan Kenton&#x27;s sidemen during the late 1940s through the 1950s; and the works of George Shearing and Stan Getz.
# The output of modern players who eschewed bebop in favor of advanced swing-era developments, including Lennie Tristano, Lee Konitz, and Warne Marsh; Dave Brubeck and Paul Desmond; and performers such as Jimmy Giuffre and Dave Pell who were influenced by Count Basie and Lester Young&#x27;s small-group music.
# Musicians from either of the previous categories who were active in California from the 1940s through the 1960s, developing what came to be known as West Coast jazz.
# &quot;Exploratory music with a subdued effect by Teddy Charles, Chico Hamilton, John LaPorta, and their colleagues during the 1950s.&quot;

Cool jazz emerged as a reaction to bop, and is characterized by more moderate tempos and &quot;a more reflective attitude&quot;.
Ted Gioia and Lee Konitz have each identified cornetist Bix Beiderbecke and saxophonist Frankie Trumbauer as early progenitors of the cool aesthetic in jazz. Gioia cites Beiderbecke&#x27;s softening of jazz&#x27;s strong rhythmic impact in favor of maintaining melodic flow, while also employing complex techniques such as unusual harmonies and whole tone scales. Trumbauer, through &quot;his smooth and seemingly effortless saxophone work,&quot; greatly affected tenor saxophonist Lester Young, who prefigured – and influenced – cool jazz more than any other musician.

Young&#x27;s saxophone playing employed a light sound, in contrast to the &quot;full-bodied&quot; approach of players such as Coleman Hawkins. Young also had a tendency to play behind the beat, instead of driving it. He more strongly emphasized melodic development in his improvisation, rather than &quot;hot&quot; phrases or chord changes. While Young&#x27;s style initially alienated some observers, the cool school embraced it. (Young would also influence bebop through Charlie Parker&#x27;s emulation of Young&#x27;s playing style.) Tanner, Gerow, and Megill point out that &quot;cool developed gradually, as did previous styles.&quot; In addition to Lester Young&#x27;s approach, cool had other antecedents:

== History ==
Cool jazz emerged in the 1940s. Its stylistic origins can be traced to Claude Thornhill&#x27;s big band, which utilized clarinets, French horns, and tubas.
In 1947, Woody Herman formed a band that included tenor saxophonists Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, and Herbie Steward, and baritone saxophonist Serge Chaloff. The result was the &quot;Four Brothers&quot; sound, in which four strong improvisers could still perform well as a coordinated, blended section. (Jimmy Giuffre composed &quot;Four Brothers&quot;, which highlighted this group.) The Herman band&#x27;s recording of &quot;Early Autumn&quot; launched Getz&#x27;s career. Meanwhile, between 1946 and 1949, baritone saxophonist and arranger Gerry Mulligan, arranger Gil Evans, and alto saxophonist Lee Konitz were all working for the Claude Thornhill Orchestra, whose instrumentation included a French horn and tuba.

In 1948, Miles Davis formed a nonet including Mulligan, Konitz, and Evans from Thornhill&#x27;s orchestra. Capitol Records recorded the group (at arranger Pete Rugolo&#x27;s suggestion) in 1949 and 1950. These recordings, originally issued as 78 rpm records, were later compiled as &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; (1957). Gerry Mulligan explained that the idea behind Davis&#x27;s Nonet was not to get away from bebop, but &quot;just to try to get a good little rehearsal band together. Something to write for... As far as the &#x27;Cool Jazz&#x27; part of it, all of that comes &quot;after&quot; the fact of what it was designed to be.&quot; As for Davis, his concern at the time was simply to play with a lighter sound, which he believed to be more expressive. Also his choice of notes suggested deliberation rather than wild exuberance.

The Miles Davis Nonet&#x27;s existence was brief, consisting only of a two-week September 1948 engagement at the Manhattan&#x27;s Royal Roost and the three recording dates that make up &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;. These recordings were not widely appreciated until some years later. However, they prefigured the work of nonet members John Lewis and Gerry Mulligan.

John Lewis went on to co-found the Modern Jazz Quartet, who incorporated classical forms, such as the fugue, in their music. Tanner, Gerow, and Megill note that the Quartet &quot;played classical forms quite precisely. For example, the fugues they played were truly baroque in form except that the exposition parts were improvised.&quot; While third stream music would combine classical elements with jazz, the Modern Jazz Quartet used these forms &quot;just to play good, swinging, subtle jazz&quot; and in pursuit of &quot;the joy of collective improvisation and counterpoint.&quot;

Gerry Mulligan, with Chet Baker, formed a pianoless quartet that was both innovative and successful. Later, Mulligan formed a &quot;Tentette&quot; that further developed the ideas he had brought to the &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; nonet.

George Shearing&#x27;s quintet, which used a more subtle bebop style, also influenced cool&#x27;s development. Both Thelonious Monk and Dizzy Gillespie praised Shearing&#x27;s approach.

While Davis, Lewis, Mulligan, and Shearing&#x27;s efforts were rooted in bebop, other musicians were less indebted to that style. In New York, pianist Lennie Tristano and saxophonist Lee Konitz developed a &quot;somewhat atonal cerebral alternative to bop which concentrated on linear improvisation and interweaving rhythmic complexities&quot;. In California, Dave Brubeck hired alto saxophonist Paul Desmond, forming a quartet. Both Konitz and Desmond used an approach that ran counter to bebop, in the sense that neither player employed a sound or style heavily indebted to Charlie Parker (or Parker&#x27;s blues elements). In a 2013 interview, Konitz noted that &quot;the blues never connected with me,&quot; and further explained &quot;I knew and loved Charlie Parker and copied his bebop solos like everyone else. But I didn&#x27;t want to sound like him. So I used almost no vibrato and played mostly in the higher register. That&#x27;s the heart of my sound.&quot;

== West Coast jazz ==

In 1951, Stan Kenton disbanded his Innovations Orchestra in Los Angeles. Many of the musicians, some of whom had also played in Woody Herman&#x27;s band, chose to remain in California. Trumpeter Shorty Rogers and drummer Shelly Manne were central figures among this group of musicians. Much of this activity centered on the Hermosa Beach Lighthouse Café, where bassist Howard Rumsey led a house band, the Lighthouse All-Stars.

Drummer Chico Hamilton led an ensemble that – unusually for a jazz group – included a cellist, Fred Katz. Tanner, Gerow, and Megill liken Hamilton&#x27;s music to chamber music, and have noted that Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;subtle rhythmic control and use of different drum pitches and timbres&quot; was well-suited for this style of music.

Tanner, Gerow, and Megill are largely dismissive of the term &quot;West Coast jazz.&quot; As it often refers to Gerry Mulligan and his associates in California, &quot;west coast&quot; merely becomes synonymous with &quot;cool,&quot; although Lester Young, Claude Thornhill, and Miles Davis were based in New York. At the same time, many musicians associated with West Coast jazz &quot;were much more involved in a hotter approach to jazz. Communication being what it is, it is hardly likely that any style of jazz was fostered exclusively in one area.&quot;

== Legacy ==
In 1959, The Dave Brubeck Quartet recorded &quot;Time Out&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; &quot;Pop Albums&quot; chart. The cool influence stretches into such later developments as bossa nova, modal jazz (especially in the form of Davis&#x27;s &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; (1959)), and even free jazz (in the form of Jimmy Giuffre&#x27;s 1961–1962 trio).

Following their work on &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;, Miles Davis and Gil Evans would again collaborate on albums such as &quot;Miles Ahead&quot;, &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, and &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot;.

Some observers saw the subsequent hard bop style as a response to cool and West Coast jazz. Conversely, David H. Rosenthal sees the development of hard bop as a response to both a perceived decline in bebop and the rise of rhythm and blues. Shelly Manne suggested that cool jazz and hard bop simply reflected their respective geographic environments: the relaxed cool jazz style reflected a more relaxed lifestyle in California, while driving bop typified the New York scene.

Ted Gioia has noted that some of the artists associated with the ECM label during the 1970s are direct stylistic heirs of cool jazz. While these musicians may not sound similar to earlier cool artists, they share the same values:clarity of expression; subtlety of meaning; a willingness to depart from the standard rhythms of hot jazz and learn from other genres of music; a preference for emotion rather than mere emoting; progressive ambitions and a tendency to experiment; above all, a dislike for bombast. Gioia also identifies cool&#x27;s influence upon other idioms, such as new-age, minimalism, pop, folk, and world music.

Cool also inspired avant-garde jazz and, later, free jazz.

<text>The Erechtheion (, latinized as Erechtheum ; , ) or Temple of Athena Polias is an ancient Greek Ionic temple on the north side of the Acropolis, Athens, which was primarily dedicated to the goddess Athena.

The Ionic building, which housed the statue of Athena Polias, has in modern scholarship been called the Erechtheion (the sanctuary of Erechtheus or Poseidon) in the belief that it encompassed two buildings mentioned by the Greek-Roman geographer Pausanias: the Temple of Athena Polias and the Erechtheion. However, whether the Erechtheion referred to by Pausanias and other sources is indeed the Ionic temple or an entirely different building has become a point of contention in recent decades, with various scholars ruling out that Athena and Erechtheus were worshipped in a single building. Alternative suggested locations of the true Erechtheion include the structures on the Acropolis conventionally identified as the Arrephorion, the Sanctuary of Zeus Polieus, the Sanctuary of Pandion, and the Dörpfeld foundations. However, while there is no consensus among scholars on this issue, the building continues to be referred to as the Erechtheion by convention.

In the official decrees the Ionic building is referred to as &quot;... το͂ νεὸ το͂ ἐμ πόλει ἐν ο͂ι τὸ ἀρχαῖον ἄγαλμα&quot; (the temple on the Acropolis within which is the ancient statue). In other instances it is referred to as the Temple of the Polias. The joint cult of Athena and Poseidon-Erechtheus appears to have been established on the Acropolis at a very early period, and they were even worshipped in the same temple as may, according to the traditional view, be inferred from two passages in Homer and also from later Greek texts. The extant building is the successor of several temples and buildings on the site. Its precise date of construction is unknown; it has traditionally been thought to have been built from –406 BC, but more recent scholarship favours a date in the 430s, when it could have been part of the programme of works instigated by Pericles.

The Erechtheion is unique in the corpus of Greek temples in that its asymmetrical composition does not conform to the canon of Greek classical architecture. This is attributed either to the irregularity of the site or to the evolving and complex nature of the cults which the building housed, or it is conjectured to be the incomplete part of a larger symmetrical building. Additionally, its post-classical history of change of use, damage, and spoliation has made it one of the more problematic sites in classical archaeology. The precise nature and location of the various religious and architectural elements within the building remain the subject of debate. The temple was nonetheless a seminal example of the classical Ionic style and was highly influential on later Hellenistic, Roman, and Greek Revival architecture.

==History==
The classical Erechtheion is the last in a series of buildings approximately on the mid-north site of the Acropolis of Athens, the earliest of which dates back to the late Bronze Age Mycenaean period. L.B. Holland conjectured that the remains under the Erechtheion was the forecourt of a palace complex similar to that of Mycenae. The scant evidence of the period LHI includes potsherds and scraps of a wall under the foundations of the Ionic temple. From the remainder of the shaft-grave period, there is nothing from LHII-LH IIIA, only from LH IIIB is there evidence of habitation in the form of terracing, children&#x27;s graves, and a limestone column base. Hurwitt, arguing by analogy with population centres elsewhere from the period, maintains that there may have been a cult centre on the acropolis to the armed goddess &quot;a-ta-na-po-ti-ni-ja&quot;, which could represent the primitive origins of the Athenian cult. Additionally, the Mycenaean well and Cyclopean walls, which appear to have been in use between LH IIIB and LH IIIC, attests to attempts to fortify the hill-top as the &quot;strong-built house of Erechtheus&quot; recorded in the Homeric tradition. The well may be an indication of the location of the cult of Erechtheus.The archaeology under the Erechtheion is also poorly evidenced for the archaic and early classical periods. Despite this a number of proposals have been made for a structure on the site immediately before the Achaemenid destruction of Athens in 480 BC. Orlandos reconstructs an obliquely orientated hexastyle amphiprostyle temple, which would have contained the &quot;trident marks&quot; in its pronaos. Others restore a number of &quot;temene&quot; adjacent to the Temple of Athena Polias or a tetrastyle naiskos. To the south of the Erechtheion site would have been the Dörpfeld Foundations Temple, now thought to be the archaic Temple of Athena Polias, the foundations of which are visible on the acropolis today. Examination of the remains of the north edge of this temple by Korres might suggest the boundaries of the pre-Ionic Erechtheion site and therefore determine the shape of the classical &quot;temenos&quot;. Korres argues that a columnar monument marking the kekropeion would have been approximately where the Porch of the Maidens is, and that there was a stoa for the Pandroseion adjacent.

The building accounts for the classical Erechtheion from 409–404 BC have survived, allowing an unusually secure dating of the construction of the temple. Nevertheless, the question remains of when the building project was inaugurated. There is no primary evidence for when construction began; it is conjectured to be either the 430s or in 421 during the Peace of Nikias. The latter is broadly the consensus view, the rationale being that this lull in the long Peloponnesian War would have been the most convenient time to begin a major construction project and that there was a likely hiatus in building during the Sicilian disaster of 413. Alternatively, dates as early as the mid-430s and as late as 412 have been put forward. Work seems to have ended in 406–405, and the last accounts were from 405–404, though some mouldings were never finished and some of the bosses of some stone blocks were not chiselled off.

The names of the architect-overseers (&quot;episkopos&quot;), Philokles and Archilochos, have come down to us. They worked on the site after 409. But the identity of the architect (&quot;architecton&quot;) is unknown. Several candidates have been suggested; namely, Mnesikles, Kallikrates, and Iktinos.

The subsequent history of the building has been one of damage, restoration and change of use, which complicates the task of reconstructing the original structure. The first recorded fire that the classical building suffered was perhaps 377–376, a second more severe fire took hold sometime in 1st century BC or earlier followed by a campaign of repair. The Erechtheion along with the Parthenon suffered a further major destruction at some point in the 3rd or 4th century AD; whether this was due to Herulian or Visigoth attack or a natural disaster is unclear. Julian the Apostate undertook the reconstruction of the Parthenon as a pagan temple in circa AD 361 and 363, at which point the Parthenon was the only attested site of the cult of Athena on the Acropolis, implying that the Erechtheion had been abandoned.

In the post-classical period, the Erechtheion was subject to a number of structural changes that must be assumed to have been prompted by the building&#x27;s adaptation to Christian worship. The first was its conversion to a pillared hall with a groin vaulted roof at some point in the 4th century. In the late 6th or 7th century, the Erechtheion was converted into a three-aisled basilica church with the West Corridor serving as the narthex. The central portion of the east foundations was removed to make room for a curved apse. In the 12th century, the basilica was renovated. The round apse was enlarged and was given straight sides on the exterior. The chancel screen was extended to the North and South Walls. During the Frankish occupation (1204–1458), the Erechteion was deconsecrated and changed to a Bishop&#x27;s residence, probably for the Catholic bishops of Athens who held mass in the Latin Cathedral of Church of Our Lady of Athens. With the advent of Ottoman control and the adaptation of the Acropolis plateau to a garrison, the Erechtheion took on its final incarnation as the Dizdar&#x27;s harem. However, new research questions whether the building was actually in use as a harem, as this is not found in Turkish sources. This final period of the building&#x27;s use also witnessed the beginning of traveller&#x27;s accounts and architectural recording of the structure along with its despoliation by antique collectors, including Elgin. This is how one of the caryatids was separated from the rest of the building and ended up in the British Museum. At one moment, Perhaps the greatest damage to the edifice came with the siege of 1826–1827, when the Maiden Porch and west facade were felled by cannon fire and the masonry joints were scavenged for lead. This ruined state is the condition of the site that prompted the first major anastylosis of the Erechtheion, by Kyriakos Pittakis between 1837 and 1840.

==Architecture==

Externally, the temple is an Ionic hexastyle, prostyle pronaos which faces east. The building is in Pentelic marble with a blue Eleusinian limestone frieze. The temple&#x27;s walls were constructed in ashlar isodomic masonry. The east porch doesn&#x27;t exhibit any entasis, but the stylobate is curved. The naos is apparently divided in two, with the floor of the western part of the building three meters lower than the eastern section but with identical ceiling height. The western end of the naos has three entrances. On the north of the western naos is a great door and step leading to the lower Ionic prostyle, dipteral tetrastyle porch of six columns, with a distinctive double anta at the north-west corner. Next to this porch is an outside terrace and steps leading to the east porch. East of the north doorway is an underground opening that leads to a crypt under the north porch with a pit for snakes. On the west end of the north elevation of the western naos, a further door and step lead to a walled &quot;temenos&quot;, the Sanctuary of Pandrosos, where the Pandroseion, tomb of Kekrops, altar of Zeus Herkeios and the sacred olive tree of Athena would have been.
On the south wall of the western naos was an L-shaped staircase which leads to the higher Porch of the Maidens (or Caryatid Porch, or Korai Porch), a prostyle tetrastyle porch, or pteron, having six sculpted female figures as supports, all facing south and standing on a low wall. The only entrance to the Porch of the Maidens was the stairway from the interior of the naos. The western end is a double-height space, and at the second-storey level, the outside west facing wall has an engaged base moulding with four engaged columns topped by Ionic capitals. The spaces between these columns were of open grillwork. From the outside, the western facade would have had the appearance of having a floor at the same level as the eastern naos. The coffered ceiling of the north porch is continued at the Porch of the Maidens.
There is no wholly satisfactory account of the interior layout of the Erechtheion in antiquity since it has over time been entirely erased. The points of contention are whether and where there was an internal dividing wall, and whether the building had two storeys as suggested by Pausanias&#x27; description of it as a διπλοῦν... οἴκημα. The conventional view of the reconstruction of the interior of the Erechtheion naos is that it was divided in two in imitation of the opisthodomos of the archaic temple of Athena Polias and that the altar of Athena was in the west half of the chamber and the altars of Erechtheus, Poseidon and Boutes in the other. Alternatively, that the Erechtheion was a replacement for the east cella of the archaic Temple of Athena and would have had an east cross wall.

==Sculpture==

There are two figural sculptural programmes on the Erechtheion; the frieze and the korai of the Maiden porch.
The entablature of the naos and north porch has a frieze of blue Eleusinian limestone that was decorated with white Pentelic marble figures attached by means of iron dowels. This &quot;cameo-like&quot; effect of the contrasting stones was unique amongst Ionic temples and rare in any other applications. Of the sculpted elements, 112 fragments of the frieze have survived, perhaps 80% of the figures. Attempts to match dowel hole to figure have not been successful, and therefore the order of the figures and overall theme of frieze remains unclear. However, several attempts to identify individual scenes within the sequence of figures have been made. According to Pallat, the north porch had a chariot race with a quadriga on the west face and Athena catching the daughters of Kekrops opening the basket containing Erichthonios on the north and the birth of Ericthonios on the east.

Other suggestions for aspects of the narrative of the frieze include the story of Ion, the sacrifice of Erectheus&#x27; daughters to save Athens and the departure of Erechtheus for the battle with Eumolpos. Peter Schultz&#x27;s recent reinterpretation of the standing god and goddesses on the east porch of the Nike Athena temple as the birth of Athena invites comparison with the birth scene on the Parthenon pediment and has prompted the question of whether there is a tradition of birth scenes in Attic sculpture that was continued on the Erechtheion frieze. As is typical of the Ionic style, there is no pediment sculpture on the Erechtheion.
There are several theories about the function and significance of the Maiden Porch. Kontoleon has argued that it served as a monopteral heroön to the tomb of Kekrops. Scholl has argued that the korai are mourners for Kekrops because of the association of caryatids with tombs. Shear disputes this is a tomb since it does not follow the pattern of other religious tokens. For Shear the architectural supports are derived from the bases of the columns of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus and are typical of the miniaturization of elements of the Ionic style when it was imported from Asia Minor to the Greek mainland. Nor was the use of korai as an architectural support element a novelty, as they were used before in the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi and perhaps the Kore of Lyons and therefore represent the classical expression of an established archaic tradition.

Then there is the problem of the identity of the korai. In the building accounts they are referred to as korai or maidens. The lower arms of all the caryatids have been lost. In 1952 the discovery of copies from Tivoli revealed that the korai carried phiale, suggesting that they might be either the arrephoroi (as &quot;bearers of unmentionable things&quot;) or kanephoroi. The six korai of the porch all exhibit subtle variations, implying that they do not represent a repetition of a single person or deity but a group of individuals. Lesk argues that they may have been intended as a replacement for the (highly individuated) Acropolis korai that were destroyed by the Persians and in this capacity represent the servants of Athena who stood ready to make libation to the cult statue housed inside. Vickers suggests not only a later date for the construction of the Erechtheion but that the korai are actually Vitruvian caryatids and represent a memorial to Athens&#x27;s humiliation in the Peloponnesian War.

The Erechtheion is a &quot;remarkably luxurious&quot; building in the detailing of its mouldings. Lotus-palmette chains (anthemion) decorate the column capitals and epicranitis of the temple. Additionally, egg-and-dart, egg and leaf, bead and reel, lesbian cyma, guilloches, and rosettes are liberally placed around the entablature, door and window frames, and the coffering of the ceilings. The capitals were gilded and the braidings at the column bases were studded with coloured glass.

==Cult objects==
 The Erechtheion potentially served as a reliquary for an assortment of religious items rather than being dedicated to a single deity, as was usually the case. Ludwig Pallat posits that the Erechtheion is the expression of the autochthonic nature of Athenian identity. J.H. Clements argues that the Erechtheion was built to house a diverse collection of religious objects, akin to a &quot;&#x27;museum of curiosities&#x27; for the collections of religious objects&quot;, and that it is problematic to draw an overall theme for the religious purpose of the temple.

The cults of the Erechtheion encompass the birth of Erichthonius from the soil of Attica; the tomb of Kekrops, mythical king and cult hero to the Athenians; and their relationship to the tutelary deities of the city. For many years, the accepted scholarly opinion has been that the Erechtheion fulfilled a triplicate purpose in its interior design: to &quot;replace the Old Temple [of Athena], to house the old image, and to unite in an organized building several shrines and places of religious significance.&quot;

The following may be the product of an attempted syncretism or merely a bricolage of relics accrued over time. On the east porch, immediately before the temple door, was an altar to Zeus Hypatos. Continuing inside in the eastern chamber of the naos would have been the altars to Poseidon and Erechtheus, Hephaistos and Boutes, and thrones of the temple priests. It is here that Athena&#x27;s peplos might have been displayed. In the western section, there may have been the tomb of Erechtheus, the xoanon of Athena Polias and perhaps immediately before that a table. Additionally, this room housed the Lamp of Kallimachos, a Hermes, the saltwater well and a collection of spoils from the Persian War. To the north of this chamber was the north porch whose coffered ceiling was pierced supposedly as the entry point of one of Poseidon&#x27;s thunderbolts; indentations below were thought to be the resulting trident marks. The altar of Thyechoos stood over the trident marks. Continuing outside was the sanctuary precinct, which may have contained the sacred olive tree, the snake pit, the Tomb of Kekrops and the Pandrosieon.

==Scholarship and conservation==

Travellers&#x27; accounts of the Erechtheion are relatively scarce before the 18th century, when relations between the Ottoman Empire and Europe began to improve and access to Greece was opened. Moreover, the building north of the Parthenon was not identified with Pausanias&#x27; description of the Temple of Athena Polias until Spon and Wheler&#x27;s account of the topography of the acropolis published in 1682. Their use of ancient sources in the identification of ancient buildings rather than local folklore, as had been the case before, was innovative and presaged the beginning of scholarship with regard to the Erechtheion.

In this same spirit came the work of Richard Pococke, who published the first reconstruction of the temple in 1745 and who was the first to conjecture the existence of a larger, symmetrical building. Later, Stuart and Revett published the first accurate measured drawings of the Erechtheion in the second volume of their &quot;Antiquities of Athens&quot; in 1787. This book, perhaps more than any other, was influential in disseminating the Ionic style and the form of the Erechtheion amongst architects and an appreciative public in the 18th and 19th centuries.

For a record of the temple&#x27;s condition prior to its destruction during the Greek War of Independence, there are the detailed drawings of William Gell. Gell&#x27;s period of study in 1800–1801 coincided with the activity of Lord Elgin, whose despoliation of the Maiden Porch was, at the time, more controversial than his removal of the Parthenon sculptures.

In the post-revolutionary period, ambitious plans were drawn up to clear the Acropolis and build a royal palace for the newly installed Bavarian king. Although no such palace was built, the plateau was cleared of much of the post-classical accretions, which were thought to obscure the site, and left as a monument and archaeological site.

For the Erechtheion this meant the remnants of the Frankish North Addition, the Venetian vault in the North Porch, the Ottoman masonry structure in the angle of the westward projection of the North Porch and the West Façade, and the Frankish and Ottoman alterations of the interior were removed. The first attempted reconstruction of the damaged building was Pittakis&#x27;s in 1839–40. The second anastylosis was Nikolaos Balanos&#x27;s in 1902–1909. Dissatisfaction with Balanos&#x27;s haphazard placement of the ashlar blocks and his use of steel joints that caused additional damage led to the creation of the interdisciplinary Acropolis Restoration Service in 1975, whose conservation work is ongoing.

<text>Ray Anderson (born October 16, 1952) is an American jazz trombonist. Trained by the Chicago Symphony trombonists, he is regarded as someone who pushes the limits of the instrument, including performing on alto and soprano trombone. He is a colleague of trombonist George E. Lewis. Anderson also plays sousaphone (marching tuba) and sings. He was frequently chosen in &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine&#x27;s Critics Poll as best trombonist throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s.

==Biography==
After studying in California, he moved to New York in 1972 and freelanced. In 1977, he joined Anthony Braxton&#x27;s Quartet (replacing George E. Lewis) and started working with Barry Altschul&#x27;s group. In addition to leading his own groups since the late 1970s including the funk-oriented Slickaphonics, in which he began taking an occasional good-humored vocal, where he shows the ability to sing two notes at the same time (a minor third apart). Anderson has worked with George Gruntz&#x27;s Concert Jazz Band.

Anderson has worked with David Murray, Charlie Haden&#x27;s Liberation Music Orchestra, Dr. John, Luther Allison, Bennie Wallace, Gerry Hemingway, Henry Threadgill, John Scofield, Roscoe Mitchell, Randy Sandke&#x27;s Inside Out Band, Sam Rivers&#x27; Rivbea Orchestra, Bobby Previte, George Russell and others. Anderson is a member of Jim Pugh&#x27;s Super Trombone with Dave Bargeron and Dave Taylor. He received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts for a series of solo trombone concerts.

Anderson has frequently returned to his early love of New Orleans music for inspiration. His Alligatory Band and Pocket Brass Band, featuring tuba player Bob Stewart or sousaphonist Matt Perrine and trumpeter Lew Soloff, are rooted in its tradition. Since 2003 he has taught and conducted at Stony Brook University.

<doc id="280940" wikidata="Q1938640" url="?curid=280940" title="Hobgoblin">
<text>A hobgoblin is a household spirit, appearing in English folklore, once considered helpful, but which since the spread of Christianity has often been considered mischievous. Shakespeare identifies the character of Puck in his &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; as a hobgoblin.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;hobgoblin&quot; comes from &quot;hob&quot;.
The earliest known use of the word can be traced to about 1530, although it was likely in use for some time prior to that.

==Folklore==

Hobgoblins seem to be small, hairy little men who, like their close relatives the brownies, are often found within human dwellings, doing odd jobs around the house while the family is asleep. Such chores are typically small tasks like dusting and ironing. Often, the only compensation necessary in return for these is food.

While brownies are more peaceful creatures, hobgoblins are more fond of practical jokes. They also seem to be able to shapeshift, as seen in one of Puck&#x27;s monologues in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Robin Goodfellow is perhaps the most mischievous and most infamous of all his kind, but many are less antagonizing. Like other fairy folk, hobgoblins are easily annoyed. They can be mischievous, frightening, and even dangerous. Attempts to give them clothing will often banish them forever, though whether they are offended by such gifts or are simply too proud to work in new clothes differs from teller to teller.

;Billy Blind: is a clever hobgoblin or brownie found in several ballads collected by F. J. Child. Billy Blind helps humans in dramatic situations by offering valuable information and advice.

;Blue Burches: is the name of a shapeshifting hobgoblin who played harmless pranks in the home of a shoemaker and his family on the Blackdown Hills in Somerset. His usual form was that of an old man wearing baggy blue breeches but he also took the form of a white horse, a black pig and a wisp of blue smoke. The family took his presence in good stride but some clergymen learned of his existence and banished him from the house.

;Robin Roundcap: (not to be confused with Robin Redcap) haunted Spaldington Hall in Spaldington, East Riding of Yorkshire, and was a hearth spirit of the true hobgoblin type. He helped thresh the corn and performed other domestic chores, but when he was in the mood for mischief he would mix the wheat and chaff again, kick over the milk pail, and extinguish the fire. He is said to have been confined in a well for a stipulated number of years through the prayers of three clergymen. This well is known as Robin Roundcap&#x27;s Well.

;Dobby: is another term for hobgoblin in Lancashire and Yorkshire according to the folklorist Elizabeth Mary Wright, especially one that is a relentless prankster. Much like the boggart, a dobby&#x27;s pranks may become so troublesome that a family decides to move elsewhere, only to find that the dobby has followed them (one version of this tale involves Robin Roundcap). However, one Yorkshire dobby (or hob) lived in a cave and was noted for curing children of the whooping cough. Dobbies could be just as industrious as other hobgoblins and brownies, which led to the expression &quot;Master Dobbs has been helping you&quot; whenever a person has accomplished more work than was expected. The term is also referenced in the character of the house-elf Dobby in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series.

==Variants==
The bauchan is a Scottish domestic hobgoblin that is mischievous and belligerent but also very helpful when the need arises.

The bwbach (or boobach, plural bwbachod) is a Welsh domestic hobgoblin that will perform household chores in return for bowls of cream. They are good-natured but mischievous and have a dislike of clergymen and teetotalers, upon whom they will play relentless pranks.

==Literature==
In the poem &quot;L&#x27;Allegro&quot; (1645) by John Milton a domestic hobgoblin or brownie, known as a Lubbar Fend (or lubber fiend) and described as strong and hairy, threshes the corn then lays by the fireplace enjoying his bowl of cream that he earns as payment. In the earlier play &quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle&quot; (1607) by Francis Beaumont, a similar being is known as &quot;Lob-Lie-by-the-Fire&quot;, described as a giant and the son of a witch. Folklorist K. M. Briggs stated that the two creatures are generally equated. Briggs&#x27;s own fantasy novel, &quot;Hobberdy Dick&quot; (1955), is about a hobgoblin that lives in the home of a 17th century Puritan family.

In a 1684 hymn Bunyan couples the hobgoblin with &quot;a foul fiend&quot;, as two monstrous beings who try (and fail) to &quot;daunt the Pilgrim&#x27;s spirit&quot;.

The term &quot;hobgoblin&quot; is used sometimes to mean a superficial object that is a source of (often imagined) fear or trouble. The best-known example of this usage is probably Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s line, &quot;A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds&quot;, from the essay &quot;Self-Reliance&quot;.

Hobgoblins exist in the works of Tolkien as a larger kind of orc, though they are not prominently featured. In the preface of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, he states that &quot;&quot;Orc&quot; is not an English word. It occurs in one or two places but is usually translated goblin (or hobgoblin for the larger kinds)&quot;.

In &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot;, a hobgoblin
is portrayed as a selfish character, always hungry, insulting to others, and annoyed with always being confused for a goblin.

==In Popular Culture==
in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, the name &quot;hobgoblin&quot; is used for a vaguely ape-faced humanoid species that live in militarized tribal societies or as leaders of goblin tribes.

<text>The Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science (TAMS) is a two-year residential early entrance college program serving approximately 375 high school juniors and seniors at the University of North Texas. Students are admitted from every region of the state through a selective admissions process. TAMS is a member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology.

== History ==
TAMS was established on June 23, 1987 by the 70th Texas Legislature, in order to provide high school students an opportunity to take advanced coursework in math, science, and engineering. It was designed as a residential program at the University of North Texas for high school-aged students gifted in mathematics and science.

The establishment of this innovative program is from national concern among educators about anticipated shortages of students who would be sufficiently well prepared in mathematical and scientific problem solving. Recognizing that American youth would need to compete in an increasingly technological society, several states including Texas opted to create alternative educational programs that would attract students to the fields of mathematics and science as well as offer bright, motivated young people an accelerated education in these areas of study. TAMS differs from other state-supported residential math and science schools in that the academy offers students the opportunity to complete two years of college concurrently with the last two years of high school.

The first TAMS class arrived on August 22, 1988. This graduating Class of 1990 included 65 students, colloquially known as &quot;TAMSters.&quot; The academy has since grown and, in recent years, the graduating classes have been as large as 185 students.

==Admissions==

TAMS is required by &quot;to identify exceptionally gifted and intelligent high school students at the junior and senior levels and offer them a challenging education to maximize their development&quot;.

Applicants are limited to Texas residents in high school. The admissions process for TAMS is holistic and modeled on those of most colleges. Applications are typically accepted between July and mid-May of a student&#x27;s sophomore year of high school, though some freshmen apply. Multiple criteria are assessed, including middle and high school grades, the rigor of classes taken at school (particularly for mathematics classes), letters of recommendation from teachers and an academic counselor or principal, SAT scores from no later than the January of the applicant&#x27;s sophomore year, and an essay. Selected applicants are then invited to interview at one of TAMS&#x27;s &quot;Interview Days.&quot; During Interview Day, applicants take algebra diagnostic tests, tour the campus, and attend group interviews. Out of more than 500 students who apply each year, only around 200 are ultimately accepted into the program.

==Academics==
Due to the selectivity of its admissions process, TAMS has traditionally had a strong academic culture among its students. The class of 2015 alone had 66 National Merit Semifinalists out of a graduating class size of less than 200. In 2013 the average SAT score for TAMS students was 2121, the second highest of any school in Texas and tenth highest in the nation. TAMS students have placed in numerous state, national and global competitions, most notably in research-based competitions such as the Intel Talent Search and Siemens Competition. In the 2013 Siemens Foundation Competition, 2 TAMS students were named regional finalists and 17 more were recognized as semifinalists. In 2014, The Siemens Foundation awarded 7 TAMS students the placement of regional finalists, and 16 more as semifinalists; 2015 saw 16 semifinalists and 3 regionals finalists from TAMS. Most recently, 15 TAMS seniors were awarded semifinalist status in the 2016 Siemens competition; senior Prateek Kalakuntla advanced to regional finalist and subsequently national finalists status, winning $30,000 at national finals in December 2016.

=== Curriculum ===
TAMS operates wholly within the University of North Texas. TAMS students take UNT classes for their two years at TAMS, and graduate with a TAMS high school diploma as well as a UNT college transcript with a minimum of 57 hours of transferable college credits. While at TAMS, they are considered to be concurrently enrolled in high school and college, and attain a college-like experience all while living among same-age peers.

TAMS students essentially follow a college workload and schedule, and take classes alongside regular UNT students. They are officially UNT students with &quot;TAMS&quot; as their major. Core subjects required for graduation include biology or computer science, chemistry, physics (mechanics and electromagnetism), mathematics (precalculus and calculus), English literature, US history, and political science. All courses are UNT university courses and taught by UNT faculty and professors. A wide variety of elective courses may be taken in addition to required classes after the first semester. Students are also required to attend a weekly seminar on Monday afternoons, which includes various presentations covering academic topics like research opportunities and non-academic topics.

All core courses must be taken at TAMS/UNT during the fall and spring semesters, though some elective courses may be taken during the summer. The minimum cumulative GPA required for graduation is 3.0. Students whose GPA drops below this threshold are put on academic probation, and may be dismissed from the academy. During the first semester only, the minimum GPA that a student can have is 2.7. Students whose GPA is below this value will be dismissed within the first semester. Students who have a GPA between 2.7 and 3.0 will be placed on academic probation for the following semester.

===Tuition and fees===
TAMS students are responsible for paying for room and board in McConnell Hall and a mandatory UNT meal plan every semester, as well as a yearly $2,500 program charge and approximately $5,500 tuition fees (after scholarship is applied). About thirty percent of students receive financial aid through programs such as FAFSA to defray costs. Funding for TAMS is provided through a special appropriations bill and with support from the Foundation School Fund.

===Research, scholarships, and awards===
Students at TAMS are encouraged to take the opportunity of conducting research under the guidance of a professor either on or off-campus during the school year as well as during the summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://tams.unt.edu/research&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The TAMS Summer Research Scholarship is offered to about 60 students per year to fund these research pursuits; students performing research throughout the summer typically commit 30 to 40 hours per week to the lab. Students&#x27; research are often recognized by professors listing a student as co-author of a papers or by awards at competitions such as Siemens Westinghouse Competition in Science and Technology and the Intel Science Talent Search. From 1999 to 2016, TAMS students were named semifinalists 84 times in the talent search and finalists 11 times. This was tied the fifth most finalists of any school during this period. A number of students also compete for the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship as university students. TAMS students are frequently quite successful in the competition; in 2016, all four TAMS students nominated by the University of North Texas won the scholarship, making UNT one of the few universities in the country to achieve this feat.

In 2012, while attending TAMS, Monica Thieu became the youngest person ever to win the Jeopardy! College Championship.

==Student life==
TAMS students have created an unofficial Wiki page which has more information regarding student life at TAMS. This page is primarily maintained by current TAMS students.

Because they are technically considered students at the University of North Texas, TAMS students enjoy all of the same benefits as other UNT students including access to and usage of university cafeterias, libraries, recreational facilities and participation in UNT-sponsored activities and competitions. An exception to this is a nightly curfew (see below).

===McConnell Hall===
All TAMS students live in McConnell Hall. In the program&#x27;s early days, TAMS students shared the building with regular UNT students before the program grew too large to share its dormitory with other students. McConnell Hall, originally built in 1961 as an all-female dormitory, consists of four wings (the hall originally had three before a major expansion in 1990) and three floors, segregated by gender and grade level. The hall is furnished with a kitchenette, multiple meeting rooms, laundry rooms, bathrooms and two common rooms. One of the common rooms, the Smitty Study, serves as a public recreation room when it is not functioning as a study area during quiet hours. The other common room, Mac Café, aptly named because it once was home to a university cafeteria, hosts various student activities and serves as a gathering place for both academic and social interaction.

Students reside in pairs in any one of the hall&#x27;s 374 dual-occupancy dormitories, each of which includes two beds, dressers and drawers, desks, a sink, internet access and electrical sockets; some rooms contain a private toilet and shower, while others share a bathroom with adjacent rooms. Community bathrooms are available for the remaining rooms. Because all TAMS students live in the same building and in close proximity, TAMS tends to be a very close-knit community. While students can, for the most part, schedule their own day however they wish, all students have a curfew and must remain inside the hall from 11 p.m. (1.00 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights) to 6 a.m. without special permission. Enforcement includes nightly check-ins with resident assistants, who are regular undergraduate students at UNT. However, students may submit requests to be absent overnight or past curfew.

=== Volunteering ===
The TAMS program allows students to find volunteering opportunities within the Denton, Texas area. Most volunteering activities are coordinated through numerous clubs and organizations within the program as well as through student life. TAMS students participate throughout the academic year. Volunteering ranges from, but not limited to grade school tutoring, hospital and nursing home volunteering, participating in Denton environmental clean up, hosting UNT sponsored charity auctions and service events, etc. Students have also established non-profit start up programs that promote volunteering within the Denton community. PCS 2 Prosper is one of the many notable organizations that have been founded by TAMS students. Volunteers collect donated computers and laptops from the community and some companies, and distributes them to schools and homes in need after repairing and renovating them.

Forward Tutoring is a prominent non-profit start up created by TAMS students with the mission to build a community of mentors and tutors. It is known to be an online tutoring service in which TAMS students volunteer their time to schools in need of academic aid. Student who seek this aid in turn participate in community services for other non-profit organizations. The organization gained recognition for its program and was able to receive a grant in 2011 from the Murphy Entrepreneurship after a generally well received beta launch.

=== Clubs and events ===
TAMS students participate in the UNT community through activities such as community service projects and tutoring. TAMS has a number of student activities and events, ranging from academic competitions to performance and cultural groups. Club meetings and activities are usually coordinated using Facebook. Most clubs at TAMS offer numerous volunteering and community service opportunities. Despite the fact that only hours volunteered during the school year while at TAMS count, in the 2014–2015 school year students at TAMS volunteered an average of over 98 hours per student. In addition to clubs, students may join any UNT clubs outside of TAMS. A selection of currently active clubs (as well as selected competitions entered by TAMS students), many of which offer volunteering opportunities, can be found below:

Frequent workshops featuring guest speakers (often TAMS alumni) are also held for TAMS students covering a variety of topics, from college admissions to working in the industry. College visits take place on a regular basis as well.

<text>Walter Norris (December 27, 1931 – October 29, 2011) was an American pianist and composer.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on December 27, 1931, Norris first studied piano at home with his mother, then with John Summers, a local church organist. His first professional performances were with the Howard Williams Band in and around Little Rock during his junior high and high school years. After graduating from high school, Norris played briefly with Mose Allison, then did a two-year tour in the US Air Force. After his time in the Air Force, Norris played with Jimmy Ford in Houston, Texas, then moved to Los Angeles where he became an integral part of the West Coast Jazz scene. While in Los Angeles, he played on Jack Sheldon&#x27;s first album and on Ornette Coleman&#x27;s first album, &quot;Something Else! The Music of Ornette Coleman&quot; (1958) for Contemporary Records.

In 1960, Norris relocated to New York City and formed a trio with guitarist Billy Bean and bassist Hal Gaylor, and the group made one album. Norris took a job at the New York City Playboy Club in 1963 and in time became the club&#x27;s director of entertainment, remaining there until 1970. From 1970 to 1974, Norris was a freelance performer and taught in the New York area. In 1974, he replaced Roland Hanna in the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Band. After a tour of Scandinavia, he remained in Europe to record a duo album with double bass player George Mraz, titled &quot;Drifting&quot;.

Returning to the states, Norris joined the Charles Mingus Quintet in 1976. In the dressing room prior to a performance, according to Norris, he made the mistake of calling the temperamental Mingus &quot;Charlie&quot; instead of &quot;Charles,&quot; which angered Mingus. At that moment, the stage manager entered the room and told the musicians they were needed onstage immediately, which provided a temporary escape from confrontation. Norris quit the band and accepted a job in Berlin, Germany, as pianist with the Sender Freies Berlin-Orchestra. He moved to Berlin in January 1977 and lived there from that point. He insisted that his fear of Mingus was the primary cause of the move to Europe.

===Later career===
In 1990, Norris signed a five-album contract with Concord Records. The resulting recordings were all significant, but especially &quot;Sunburst&quot; (with saxophonist Joe Henderson), &quot;Hues of Blues&quot; (with George Mraz), and the &quot;Live at Maybeck Recital Hall&quot; solo piano album. In 1998, without a record contract, Norris self-financed the album &quot;From Another Star&quot;, made in New York with bassist Mike Richmond, pressing 1,000 copies.

A documentary film directed by Chuck Dodson, &quot;Walter Norris, a documentary&quot;, was completed in 2010. In 2005 an autobiography, &quot;In Search of Musical Perfection&quot; and method book &quot;Essentials for Pianist Improvisers&quot; were released. In July 2006, Norris recorded at his home in Berlin with Los Angeles bassist Putter Smith.

He died on October 29, 2011, at his home in Berlin, Germany, and is survived by his wife, Kirsten. His other descendants were two daughters from his previous marriage to Mandy, Dinah and Delia (deceased), and two granddaughters, Emily and Holly.

<text>Jack Pepper (born Edward Jackson Culpepper; June 14, 1902 – April 1, 1979) was an American vaudeville dancer, singer, comedian, musician, and later in life a nightclub manager.

Pepper began entertaining on the vaudeville circuit in his youth with his sisters Helen and Winnie Mae. He first came to national prominence in the 1920s as part of the duo Salt and Pepper with Frank Kurtz (Salt). Pepper sang and played ukulele in a style similar to that of Cliff Edwards as well as performed comic and dance bits. Salt and Pepper appeared prominently in Broadway revues, made radio broadcasts, and recorded a number of sides for Cameo Records in the mid-1920s.

After striking out on his own, Pepper teamed with dancer Ginger Rogers as Ginger and Pepper. Rogers and Pepper were married from 1929 to 1931. Although the marriage was short, they continued to speak respectfully of each other all their lives.

The year 1929 marked Pepper&#x27;s film debut in the short subject &quot;After the Show&quot;.

By his second wife, Dawn, Pepper was the father of actress Cynthia Pepper, star of the 1961 TV comedy series &quot;Margie&quot;.

In 1940, he appeared in the Bing Crosby film &quot;Rhythm on the River&quot; and &quot;Road to Singapore&quot;, the first Bob Hope–Bing Crosby &quot;Road&quot; picture. Drafted during World War II, he toured with the USO.

Pepper continued as a film and television character actor into the 1960s. He made three guest appearances during the 1964–1965 final season of &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;. He was seen with Academy Award winner Lee Marvin in the 1965 hit comedy &quot;Cat Ballou&quot;. Throughout his career, Jack Pepper appeared in 10 Bob Hope features, including the 1969 comedy &quot;How to Commit Marriage&quot;, his final role.

He was buried at the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles.

<text>The Cantharellaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. The family contains the chanterelles and related species, a group of fungi that superficially resemble agarics (gilled mushrooms) but have smooth, wrinkled, or gill-like hymenophores (spore-bearing undersurfaces). Species in the family are ectomycorrhizal, forming a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of trees and other plants. Many of the Cantharellaceae, including the chanterelle (&quot;Cantharellus cibarius&quot;), the Pacific golden chanterelle (&quot;Cantharellus formosus&quot;), the horn of plenty (&quot;Craterellus cornucopioides&quot;), and the trumpet chanterelle (&quot;Craterellus tubaeformis&quot;), are not only edible, but are collected and marketed internationally on a commercial scale.

==Taxonomy==

===History===
The family was originally described in 1888 by German mycologist Joseph Schröter to accommodate the chanterelles, which at that time were thought to be an evolutionary link between &quot;primitive&quot; &quot;Thelephora&quot; species with smooth hymenophores (spore-bearing surfaces) and more &quot;advanced&quot; &quot;Agaricus&quot; species with gilled hymenophores. In 1903, French mycologist René Maire proposed a new classification system that emphasized the possession of &quot;stichic&quot; basidia (basidia with nuclear spindles arranged longitudinally), a characteristic of the Cantharellaceae that linked the family to the Hydnaceae and Clavulinaceae. This led Ernst Albert Gäumann to include the genus &quot;Hydnum&quot; (the hedgehog fungi) within the Cantharellaceae. In his 1964 survey of fungal families, Dutch mycologist Marinus Anton Donk limited the Cantharellaceae to &quot;Cantharellus&quot; and &quot;Craterellus&quot; species, together with some close tropical associates, and this disposition was widely accepted.

===Current status===

Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has confirmed Donk&#x27;s circumscription of the Cantharellaceae, though the smaller genera have not yet been sequenced. According to a standard 2008 reference work, the family contains 5 genera and over 90 species worldwide.

==Description==
Fruit bodies of most species in the family are mushroom-like or trumpet-like, with spore-bearing surfaces that are smooth, wrinkled, veined, or gill-like and that are typically decurrent (running down the upper stem). The consistency is fleshy, the hyphal system being monomitic (consisting of generative hyphae only). The basidia are comparatively large and often have more than the standard 4 sterigmata. Spores are smooth and white to yellowish or pinkish in deposit.

==Habitat and distribution==
All species within the Cantharellaceae are believed to be ectomycorrhizal, forming a mutually beneficial relationships with the roots of living trees and other plants. Basidiocarps typically occur on the ground or in leaf litter in woodland. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution, though the majority of species are tropical. &quot;Afrocantharellus&quot;, segregated as a genus distinct from &quot;Cantharellus&quot; in 2012, has four species found only in Africa.

==Economic importance==
Many species of &quot;Cantharellus&quot;, &quot;Craterellus&quot;, and &quot;Goossensia&quot; are edible and several are collected and marketed on a commercial scale. In Europe, the commercial species are &quot;Cantharellus cibarius&quot;, &quot;Craterellus cornucopioides&quot;, and &quot;Craterellus tubaeformis&quot; which are sold fresh, dried, or canned and are either sourced in Europe or imported, mainly from China. Various African &quot;Cantharellus&quot; species (often collected in miombo woodlands) are also imported into Europe and marketed as &quot;chanterelles&quot;. In North America, &quot;Cantharellus formosus&quot; is an additional, widely marketed species. The global trade in species of the Cantharellaceae has been estimated (2005) to be worth over £1bn (US$1.5bn) per year.

<text>The Cantharellales are an order of fungi in the class Agaricomycetes. The order includes not only the chanterelles (Cantharellaceae), but also some of the tooth fungi (Hydnaceae), clavarioid fungi (Aphelariaceae and Clavulinaceae), and corticioid fungi (Botryobasidiaceae). Species within the order are variously ectomycorrhizal, saprotrophic, associated with orchids, or facultative plant pathogens. Those of economic importance include edible and commercially collected &quot;Cantharellus&quot;, &quot;Craterellus&quot;, and &quot;Hydnum&quot; species as well as crop pathogens in the genera &quot;Ceratobasidium&quot; and &quot;Thanatephorus&quot;/&quot;Rhizoctonia&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The order was originally proposed in 1926 by German mycologist Ernst Albert Gäumann to accommodate species within the phylum Basidiomycota having &quot;stichic&quot; basidia (basidia with nuclear spindles arranged longitudinally). On this basis, he included three families within the Cantharellales: the Cantharellaceae (including the Hydnaceae), the Clavulinaceae, and the Exobasidiaceae. The last group are now placed within the Exobasidiales.

By 1995, the order had been amended (based on micromorphological research) to include not only the Cantharellaceae, but also the Aphelariaceae, Clavariaceae, Clavariadelphaceae, Clavulinaceae, Craterellaceae, Hydnaceae, Physalacriaceae, Pterulaceae, Scutigeraceae, Sparassidaceae, and Typhulaceae.

===Current status===
Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has redefined the Cantharellales. As well as the Cantharellaceae (chanterelles and their allies, inclusive of the Craterellaceae), the order currently comprises fungi with morphologically diverse sporocarps (fruit bodies) within the Aphelariaceae (clavarioid fungi), Botryobasidiaceae (corticioid fungi), Ceratobasidiaceae (heterobasidiomycetes), Clavulinaceae (clavarioid fungi), Hydnaceae (tooth fungi), and Tulasnellaceae (heterobasidiomycetes). The Clavariaceae, Physalacriaceae, Pterulaceae, and Typhulaceae, previously included within the order, are now placed within the Agaricales; the Clavariadelphaceae are now in the Gomphales; the Sparassidaceae in the Polyporales. The Scutigeraceae have been replaced by the Albatrellaceae within the Russulales. According to a 2008 estimate, the order contains 7 families, 38 genera, and 544 species.

==Habitat and distribution==
Most fungi within the order are ectomycorrhizal, forming mutually beneficial associations with certain trees, shrubs, and other vascular plants. Species in the Botryobasidiaceae are believed to be saprotrophs of fallen wood and leaf litter. Species in the Ceratobasidiaceae are also saprotrophs, but some are capable of becoming plant pathogens. Species in the Tulasnellaceae are saprotrophic, but are also associated with orchid mycorrhiza, as are some species in the Ceratobasidiaceae. Distribution is cosmopolitan.

==Economic importance==

Sporocarps (fruit bodies) of chanterelles and some &quot;Hydnum&quot; species, particularly &quot;Hydnum repandum&quot;, are edible and widely collected on a commercial scale. They are marketed fresh or processed and traded internationally. Several species in the Ceratobasidiaceae, notably &quot;Rhizoctonia solani&quot;, cause significant diseases of cereals and other commercial crops, as well as turf grass.

==Genera &quot;incertae sedis&quot;==

Some genera of the Cantharellales have not been assigned to any family, i.e., they are &quot;incertae sedis&quot; with respect to familial placement:

* &quot;Bulbilla&quot; – 1 sp.
* &quot;Minimedusa&quot; – 3 spp.
* &quot;Odontiochaete&quot; – 1 sp.
* &quot;Radulochaete&quot; – 2 spp.
* &quot;Schildia&quot; – 1 sp.

<text>Sandy Rass is a British government statistician and a British songwriter/producer of Fast Food Rockers and others, and a singer, dancer and actor.
He was born in London and trained at the Royal Ballet School for 3 years and then at Italia Conti Academy for a further 3 years as a singer/dancer/actor. As a performer, Rass starred in the West End musicals &quot;Starlight Express&quot; and &quot;Cats&quot;, and played leading roles in the UK tours of &quot;42nd Street&quot;, &quot;What a Feeling!&quot; and &quot;Living La Vida Loca&quot;. He was a backing dancer for numerous pop artists, most notably appearing with Diana Ross at Wembley Stadium, and fronting the pop act Reel 2 Real (&quot;I Like to Move It&quot;) on the &quot;Smash Hits Tour&quot; alongside other major British and international pop acts.

During his varied career he also featured appearances in operas such as &quot;The Mikado&quot; with the ENO at the Coliseum, &quot;La Bohème&quot; at the &quot;Royal Albert Hall&quot;, and &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; and &quot;Tales of Hoffmann&quot; with the Royal Opera Company, before making his name as a pop songwriter.

Writing with Mike Stock of Stock Aitken Waterman, Sandy most notably co-wrote and co-produced &quot;The Fast Food Song&quot; by The Fast Food Rockers - one of the biggest hits of 2003.

He is also known for his work as Musical Supervisor and Musical Arranger on the Singapore Repertory Theatre production of &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot;, starring Lea Salonga both in Singapore and Manila in 1999 and 2000, and having radically reworked the musical arrangements of the 1999 London version of Oscar winner Stephen Schwartz&#x27;s &quot;Pippin&quot; at the Bridewell Theatre.

Among others, Sandy worked with Nick Bridges from Ministry of Sound, Jon Pearn of Full Intention and Amanda Wilson from Freemasons - the singer of hits &quot;Love on my Mind, &quot;Watchin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Bromance&quot;, writing and co-producing the classic Hed Kandi club hit &quot;Intoxicated&quot; performed by R.A.W. featuring Amanda Wilson.

<text>Johannes Leo Africanus (born al-Hasan Muhammad al-Wazzan [[Fez, Morocco|al-Fasi]], ; – ) was an Andalusi diplomat and author who is best known for his 1526 book &quot;Cosmographia et geographia de Affrica&quot;, later published by Giovanni Battista Ramusio as &quot;Descrittione dell&#x27;Africa&quot; (&quot;Description of Africa&quot;) in 1550, centered on the geography of the Maghreb and Nile Valley. The book was regarded among his scholarly peers in Europe as the most authoritative treatise on the subject until the modern exploration of Africa. For this work, Leo became a household name among European geographers. He converted from Islam to Christianity and changed his name to Johannes Leo de Medicis (). Leo possibly returned to North Africa in 1528.

==Biography==

Most of what is known about his life is gathered from autobiographical notes in his own work. Leo Africanus was born as al-Hasan, son of Muhammad in Granada around the year 1494. The year of birth can be estimated from his self-reported age at the time of various historical events. His family moved to Fez soon after his birth. In Fez he studied at the University of al-Qarawiyyin (also spelled al-Karaouine). As a young man he accompanied an uncle on a diplomatic mission, reaching as far as the city of Timbuktu (), then part of the Songhai Empire. In 1517 when returning from a diplomatic mission to Constantinople on behalf of the Sultan of Fez Muhammad II he found himself in the port of Rosetta during the Ottoman conquest of Egypt. He continued with his journey through Cairo and Aswan and across the Red Sea to Arabia, where he probably performed a pilgrimage to Mecca.
On his way back to Tunis in 1518 he was captured by Spanish corsairs either near the island of Djerba or more probably near Crete, and imprisoned on the island of Rhodes, the headquarters of the Knights Hospitaller. The usual fate of unransomed Muslim captives was slavery in Christian galleys, but when his captors realized his intelligence and importance, he was moved to the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo in Rome and presented to Pope Leo X. He was soon freed and given a pension to persuade him to stay. He was baptized in the Basilica of Saint Peter&#x27;s in 1520. He took the Latin name &quot;Johannes Leo de Medicis&quot; (&quot;Giovanni Leone&quot; in Italian). In Arabic, he preferred to translate this name as &quot;Yuhanna al-Asad al-Gharnati&quot; (literally means John the Lion of Granada). It is likely that Leo Africanus was welcomed to the papal court as the Pope feared that Turkish forces might invade Sicily and southern Italy, and a willing collaborator could provide useful information on North Africa.

Leo Africanus left Rome and spent the next three or four years traveling in Italy. The death of his patron Leo X in 1521, and suspicions from the new Pope Adrian VI against a Muslim in court, was likely the reason for his leaving Rome. While staying in Bologna he wrote an Arabic-Hebrew-Latin medical vocabulary, of which only the Arabic part has survived, and a grammar of Arabic of which only an eight-page fragment has survived. He returned to Rome in 1526 under the protection of the new Pope Clement VII, a cousin of Leo X who replaced Adrian. According to Leo, he completed his manuscript on African geography in the same year. The work was published in Italian with the title &quot;Della descrittione dell&#x27;Africa et delle cose notabili che ivi sono, per Giovan Lioni Africano&quot; in 1550 by the Venetian publisher Giovanni Battista Ramusio. The book proved to be extremely popular and was reprinted five times. It was also translated into other languages. French and Latin editions were published in 1556 while an English version was published in 1600 with the title &quot;A Geographical Historie of Africa&quot;. The Latin edition, which contained many errors and mistranslations, was used as the source for the English translation.
There are several theories of his later life, but none of them are certain. According to one theory, he spent it in Rome until he died around 1550, the year &quot;Description of Africa&quot; was published. This theory was based on indirect allusion in a later preface to this book. According to another theory, he left shortly before the Sack of Rome by Charles V&#x27;s troops in 1527. He then returned to North Africa and lived in Tunis until his death, some time after 1550. This was based on records by German orientalist Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter, who arrived in Italy and planned (but ultimately failed) to travel to Tunis to meet Leo who had since reconverted to Islam. Yet another theory said that he left Tunis after it was captured by Charles V in 1535 for Morocco, his second home country after Granada where his relatives were still living. This was based on the assumption that Leo, having left Granada, would not have wanted to live under Christian Spanish rule again, and his wish (recorded in &quot;Description of Africa&quot;) that he wanted to ultimately return to his home country &quot;by God&#x27;s assistance&quot;.

=== Veracity of Africa trip ===
It is unlikely that Leo Africanus visited all the places that he describes and he must therefore have relied on information obtained from other travellers. It is doubtful whether he visited Hausaland and Bornu and it is even possible that he never crossed the Sahara but relied on information from other travellers that he met in Morocco. The historian Pekka Masonen has argued that the belief of his further travels was based on misreadings by modern scholars who interpreted his book as an itinerary. At the time Leo visited the city of Timbuktu, it was a thriving Islamic city famous for its learning. Home to many scholars and learned men, Timbuktu also possessed a Great Mosque, renowned for its expansive library. The town was to become a byword in Europe as the most inaccessible of cities. At the time of Leo&#x27;s journey there, it was the centre of a busy trade carried on by traders in African products, gold, printed cottons, slaves and in Islamic books.

== Name ==
In an autograph in one of his surviving manuscripts, a fragment of an Arabic-Hebrew-Latin medical vocabulary he wrote for the Jewish physician Jacob Mantino, he signed his name in Arabic as &quot;Yuhanna al-Asad al-Gharnati&quot; (literally means John the Lion of Granada), a translation of his Christian name, John-Leo, or &quot;Johannes Leo&quot; (Latin), or &quot;Giovanni Leone&quot; (Italian). He was also given the family name Medici after his patron, Pope Leo X&#x27;s family. The same manuscript also contained his original name al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Wazzan al-Fasi. al-Hasan ibn Muhammad was a patronymic name meaning &quot;al-Hasan, son of Muhammad&quot;, and &quot;al-Fasi&quot; is the Arabic demonym for someone from Fez, Morocco.

== Works ==


&quot;Cosmographia et geographia de Affrica&quot;, later published by Giovanni Battista Ramusio as &quot;Description of Africa&quot; in 1550, is Leo&#x27;s most famous work. He wrote an Arabic-Hebrew-Latin medical vocabulary for the Jewish physician Jacob Mantino. He also wrote an Arabic translation of the Epistles of St. Paul, which is dated in January 1521; the manuscript belongs to the Biblioteca Estense in Modena. Another surviving work is a biographical encyclopedia of 25 major Islamic scholars and 5 major Jewish scholars which was completed in Rome before he left the city in 1527 and published for the first time in Latin by Johann Heinrich Hottinger in 1664. Unlike &quot;Description of Africa&quot;, this biographical work was hardly noticed in Europe; the book contains various erroneous information, likely due to his lack of sources when he was in Italy, forcing him to rely on memory. In &quot;Description of Africa&quot;, he referred to plans to write other books. He planned two descriptions of places, one for the Middle East and another for Europe. He also planned to write an exposition of the Islamic faith and a history of North Africa. None of these books survived nor has there been any proof that he completed them, which might have been due to his possible return to North Africa.

== References in media ==
A fictionalized account of his life, &quot;Leo Africanus&quot;, by the Lebanese-French author Amin Maalouf, fills in key gaps in the story and places Leo Africanus in prominent events of his time.

The BBC produced a documentary about his life called &quot;Leo Africanus: A Man Between Worlds&quot; in 2011. It was presented by and directed by Jeremy Jeffs. The film followed in Leo&#x27;s footsteps from Granada, through Fez and Timbuktu, all the way to Rome.

It has been suggested that William Shakespeare may have drawn on Leo Africanus&#x27; book when preparing to write Othello.

<doc id="280976" wikidata="Q865983" url="?curid=280976" title="The Skin Game (1931 film)">
<text>The Skin Game is a 1931 British drama film by Alfred Hitchcock, based on the 1920 play by John Galsworthy and produced by British International Pictures. The story revolves around two rival families, the Hillcrists and the Hornblowers, and the disastrous results of the feud between them.

Edmund Gwenn and Helen Haye reprised their respective roles as Mr. Hornblower and Mrs. Hillcrist from the 1921 silent version.

==Plot==
The plot concerns a feud between the long-established (upper class) Hillcrists, played by C.V. France, Helen Haye, and Jill Esmond, and the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; (formerly working class) Hornblowers, played by Edmund Gwenn, John Longden, Phyllis Konstam, and Frank Lawton. Underlying themes in the story include class warfare and the results of avarice.

For his love of riches, Mr. Hornblower coldly enjoys a &quot;skin game&quot; of buying up land under false pretenses of letting the tenant farmers remain and then booting them out, in order to build factories. The Hillcrists learn of this and regret selling some land to him; in turn Hornblower considers them snobs, and taunts them with his plans to buy the picturesque countryside adjoining their rural estate which is due to be auctioned off. Visions of factories spewing smoke where a magnificent landscape has been maturing for several generations torment the Hillcrists.

At the auction, the Hillcrists are outbid, then learn it was by Hornblower&#x27;s agent. But Hillcrist employee Dawker learns a dark secret about the past life of Hornblower&#x27;s now pregnant daughter-in-law Chloe, wife of Charles Hornblower. The Hillcrists confront Chloe and elder Hornblower together, and prove their case with witnesses. They are prepared to use the information, unless Hornblower agrees to deed the land to them. Reluctantly he agrees, making them swear to silence on a Bible. But now, townspeople are already gossiping and Charles has become suspicious. Chloe, terrified that this secret threatens her marriage, goes to the Hillcrist home to beg them to make up a story to tell Charles.

At that point, Charles is announced and Chloe jumps behind a curtain. Charles has already beaten the secret out of Dawker, and declares that he intends to end his marriage. Off-camera, Chloe had left through a door behind the curtain, and in short order, had drowned herself. Mrs. Hillcrist, although upset with Dawker for breaking the vow of silence, pulls the property deed out of the desk and gives it to him for safekeeping ... he puts it in his outer pocket, clearly visible. The elder Hornblower then arrives in a fury and wrestles the deed from Dawker.

Chloe&#x27;s body is brought in. Hornblower rages that Hillcrist has destroyed him and his family completely, and he will exact revenge. A last brief, poignant scene shows a prominent large tree on the land behind the Hillcrist house being felled by a work crew using a two-man saw.

<doc id="280978" wikidata="Q7733494" url="?curid=280978" title="Fast Food Song">
<text>&quot;Fast Food Song&quot; is a song made famous by British-based band Fast Food Rockers, although it existed long before they recorded it, as a popular children&#x27;s playground song. The chorus is based on the Moroccan folk tune &quot;A Ram Sam Sam&quot; and mentions fast food restaurant chains McDonald&#x27;s, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut.

The song was released on 16 June 2003 as the lead single from their album &quot;It&#x27;s Never Easy Being Cheesy&quot;. The song was highly successful in the United Kingdom, reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart and number one on the Scottish Singles Chart. The song also achieved minor chart success worldwide and reached number 24 on the Irish Charts and number 56 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart. The song was co-written and produced by Mike Stock.

The original version of this song was written and recorded in Dutch by Eric Dikeb, called &quot;Pizza-ha-ha&quot;, even though it is better known as &quot;De Pizza Hut&quot;. &quot;Fast Food Song&quot; is only one of the many adaptations of the Dutch original. Other versions include &quot;De pizza dans&quot; by Dynamite, which was a number-one hit in Belgium&#x27;s Flanders region, and &quot;Burger Dance&quot; by DJ Ötzi and Dikeb, which reached number one in Germany.

<text>Michael Stock (born 3 December 1951) is an English songwriter, record producer, musician, and member of the songwriting and production trio Stock Aitken Waterman. He has been responsible for over a hundred top-40 hits in the UK, including 16 Number One&#x27;s and is recognised as one of the most successful songwriters of all time by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. As part of Stock Aitken Waterman in the 1980s and 90s, he holds the UK record of 11 number one records with different acts. In the UK Singles Chart he has written 54 top-ten hits including 7 number ones.

==Biography==
Stock was born in Margate, Kent, England in 1951 and grew up in Swanley, Kent. He attended White Oak primary school and Swanley comprehensive school. At Swanley school he was involved in several school variety productions. He was self-taught in playing the piano and guitar and began writing songs at the age of seven. Inspired by the Beatles, he soon became fixated with pop music and put together his first band at age 13, playing bass guitar and singing. Fascinated by the popular songwriting styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, and writers such as Irving Berlin and the energy and freshness of the Beatles, he established a deep love of pop music. Stock signed a publishing contract when he was nineteen after earning a reputation as a budding songwriter, although no one had suggested a full-time career in the music world was a possibility.

In 1970 Stock earned a placement at the University of Hull to study Drama and Theology and formed a band with a fellow student, the future film director, Anthony Minghella. Whilst at Hull, Stock met his wife Bobbie and left university when she graduated to concentrate his efforts in making it in music. In 1975 they married and soon after, sold their house in Bury, Lancashire to move back south Stock played his first paid, solo gig at Aveley Working Men&#x27;s Club in Essex in 1976, earning twenty five pounds. By the late 1970s Stock, now living in Blackheath, South London, was performing up and down the country. Performing solo, in a duo or with bands Mirage and Nightwork, Stock gained a good reputation for his live performances and was regularly booked for venues like the Hilton Hotel, Grosvenor House and the Dorchester in Mayfair. Throughout 1979 to 1981 Stock was gigging every night of the week in various bands embracing pop, dance, old standards, rock or funk.

Stock&#x27;s band had gone through several guitar players before he was alerted to Matt Aitken; a guitarist who had been spotted by another member of his band working on a cruise ship. Stock contacted Aitken to offer him a role in the band. Playing on cruise ships and in various bands of his own, Aitken was an accomplished guitarist whose style could adapt to any type of music. In 1982 Stock moved to Abbey Wood, South London where, along with Aitken he acquired a recording desk and tape machine and formed his first record label. During the break of one of Mirage&#x27;s sets on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1983, Stock informed the band he would be leaving and was going into the studio to pursue his career as a songwriter and producer. Aitken agreed to join him and from January 1984 onwards the pair worked exclusively in recording studios.

==Stock Aitken and Waterman==

===Formation and Early Hits: Divine, Hazell Dean, Dead or Alive (1984–1985)===
Stock had briefly worked with Pete Waterman in 1980 when John Milton, Mark Stock and Mike wrote a song – &quot;One Nine for a Lady Breaker&quot; – for a CB radio club. A version of the track found its way to Pete Waterman who managed Peter Collins, then a successful producer with acts like Musical Youth and Nik Kershaw. The track was re-recorded and produced by Collins; Stock sang on the track under the alias Chris Britton. In January 1984 Stock and Aitken arranged to meet Waterman at his office in the Stiff Records building, Camden Town. Waterman was seeking a new partnership and in February 1984 they went into the Marquee Studio in Wardour Street Soho to record the song &quot;The Upstroke&quot; for &#x27;Agents Aren&#x27;t Aeroplanes&#x27;- a front for their concept of a female Frankie Goes To Hollywood. The record was released on Proto Records run by Barry Evangeli and Nick East and distributed by RCA. &quot;The Upstroke&quot; achieved popularity in the gay clubs and discos where many new records were being found and subsequently promoted into the mainstream as Hi-NRG.

In 1983 Stock had been approached by Andy Paul, a Greek Cypriot, to write a song for Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest. &quot;Anna Maria Lena&quot; was voted by the Cypriot public to represent their country in the competition and the re-recorded version would be Stock and Aitken&#x27;s second collaboration with Waterman. The team were then asked to produce a song for Divine and they recorded &quot;You Think You&#x27;re a Man&quot; at the Marquee Studio, which was released by Proto Records in July 1984 reaching number 16 on the UK Singles Chart. Soon after, the team recorded Hazell Dean&#x27;s &quot;Whatever I Do, (Wherever I Go)&quot;. The song became Stock Aitken Waterman&#x27;s first top 10 hit, reaching number 4 in the UK. In September 1984 they were approached by Dead or Alive to produce the song &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot;, which became SAW&#x27;s first UK number 1 in March 1985.

===The Hit Factory: Bananarama, Mel and Kim, Princess (1985–1986)===
In 1985 the trio built a new studio at &#x27;The Vineyard&#x27; recording studio complex, The Borough, that would later be dubbed &#x27;The Hit Factory&#x27;. Whilst working with the band Brilliant, Stock wrote a song for their backing singer Desiree Heslop called &quot;Say I&#x27;m Your Number One&quot;, which became a hit in the UK under her stage name &#x27;Princess&#x27;. Towards the end of 1985 the group Bananarama approached SAW to record a cover of Shocking Blue&#x27;s &quot;Venus&quot;. The track became a huge hit in the UK and went to No. 1 in America in July 1986. Bananarama would continue to enjoy success with SAW with hits such as &quot;Love in the First Degree&quot;, &quot;I Heard a Rumour&quot; and &quot;I Want You Back&quot;. In 1986 Mel and Kim&#x27;s first single &quot;Showing Out (Get Fresh at the Weekend)&quot; went to number 3 in the UK charts and their follow-up &quot;Respectable&quot; reached number 1.

===Rick Astley, Ferry Aid (1987)===
In 1987, Rick Astley recorded what would arguably be the team&#x27;s biggest hit - &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;, though initially Stock and Aitken were unsure of its appeal with Astley&#x27;s strong but unorthodox voice. When it was released by RCA, &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; went straight to No. 1 in 17 different countries including America and the UK where it became the biggest selling record of 1987. Astley&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Together Forever&quot; also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. That year SAW produced &quot;Let It Be&quot; in aid of the victims involved in the Zeebrugge Ferry disaster, and Stock got the chance to work with his musical inspiration Paul McCartney whose original recordings of the Beatles classic were sent to the production team by producer George Martin. &quot;Let It Be&quot; went straight to No. 1 where it stayed for three weeks, knocking Stock&#x27;s own &quot;Respectable&quot; by Mel and Kim off the top spot. Two years later Stock would again collaborate with McCartney on the Gerry and the Pacemakers hit - &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot;, recorded to raise funds for the victims and their families of the Hillsborough Disaster in 1989 which also went straight to No. 1.

===Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Band Aid II (1988–1989)===
In 1987 Pete Waterman formed PWL the in-house label of SAW and one of the first artists to be released on the label was Australian soap star, Kylie Minogue. Stock was informed by Minogue&#x27;s manager, Terry Blamey, that she had been in London for ten days waiting to work with SAW though Waterman had not informed Stock. By the time Minogue entered the studio she was due on a plane back to Australia later that day. In 40 minutes Stock and Aitken had written the song, &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot;, recorded a backing track and Minogue&#x27;s vocals. &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot; was released by PWL in February 1988 and climbed to the No. 1 spot in March where it stayed for five weeks, the joint longest running No. 1 of 1988. It also went to number 1 in 25 other territories including Minogue&#x27;s native Australia. With demand for a follow-up single, Minogue was not keen on returning to England to work with SAW again after the rushed treatment she had received. Stock flew to Australia to meet Minogue and her parents at her home to apologise and successfully convinced her to record a follow-up single &quot;Got to Be Certain&quot;, which reached No. 2 in the UK charts. When her debut album &quot;Kylie&quot; was released in August 1988 it sold 2.8 million copies and she spent more weeks on the singles chart than any other artist. Minogue went on to record three more studio albums with SAW, scoring 15 successive top 10 hits including &quot;Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi&quot;, &quot;Hand on Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t Change a Thing&quot;, &quot;Tears on My Pillow&quot;, &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot; and &quot;Shocked&quot;, among many others.

Soon after, Jason Donovan&#x27;s first single, &quot;Nothing Can Divide Us&quot;, became a top-five hit. Donovan&#x27;s next single, &quot;Especially for You&quot;, a duet with Kylie Minogue, went to number 1 in January 1989. A duet had not initially been planned by SAW until retailer Woolworth&#x27;s had taken huge orders for hundreds of thousands before the song had even been written. Stock wrote &quot;Especially for You&quot;, sang the demo with a SAW backing singer and Aitken flew to Australia to record Minogue and Donovan&#x27;s vocals in time for a Christmas release. Donovan returned to the studio to record the song &quot;Too Many Broken Hearts&quot;, which went to number 1 in March 1989. His debut album &quot;Ten Good Reasons&quot; also held to the top spot for three weeks, selling 1.5 million copies. Donovan went on to have numerous hits with SAW, including the number-one hit &quot;Sealed with a Kiss&quot;, &quot;Every Day (I Love You More)&quot;, and the Christmas number-two record &quot;When You Come Back to Me&quot;, kept off the top spot by the Band Aid II record – &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, also produced by Stock Aitken and Waterman.

===Donna Summer, Cliff Richard and later work (1989–1993)===
1989 became Stock Aitken and Waterman&#x27;s most successful year having helmed seven UK number ones (a feat equalled only by George Martin in 1963) and 15 top 5s. During 1989 Stock wrote and produced over seven albums&#x27; worth of material for artists such as Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Bananarama, Donna Summer, Cliff Richard and Paul McCartney. The team supplied Donna Summer with her most successful hit single since the 1970s with &quot;This Time I Know It&#x27;s for Real&quot; and Cliff Richard&#x27;s No. 3 &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Have the Heart&quot;. SAW also gave 18-year-old singer Sonia a debut No. 1 with &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Stop Me Loving You&quot;. Stock became the first person to receive the Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year three times in a row between 1988 and 1990. In 1990 SAW picked up three &quot;Ivors&quot;: for Songwriter of the Year, Most Performed Work for Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;This Time I Know It&#x27;s for Real&quot; and Best Selling A-Side for Jason Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Too Many Broken Hearts&quot;. They received the Brit Award for Best Producers in 1987, eight &#x27;Ivor Novellos&#x27; many Music Week awards and more. Despite continued success in the &#x27;90s with the likes of Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot;, &quot;Step Back in Time&quot; and &quot;Shocked&quot;, and Lonnie Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Happenin&#x27; All Over Again&quot;, the partnership began to disband. When Aitken left in 1991 Stock stayed with Waterman to write and produce Minogue&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get to It&quot;, Sybil&#x27;s 1993 hits, &quot;The Love I Lost&quot; and &quot;When I&#x27;m Good and Ready&quot;, and Boy Krazy&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s What Love Can Do&quot; went top 20 in the US. Later that year, Stock ended his relationship with Waterman; by the end of their partnership, Stock had written and/or produced over three hundred top 75 hits and over thirty platinum-selling albums.

==Post-SAW==
In 1993 Stock formed &#x27;Love This Records&#x27;, and built a brand new multimillion-pound recording studio in London. The first record released with &#x27;Love This Records&#x27; was a dance cover of the track &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;. It was a worldwide hit for Nicki French, reaching No. 2 in America and No. 1 in seven countries selling over 2 million copies. In 1994 Simon Cowell asked Stock to produce the record for the popular kid&#x27;s TV show &#x27;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&#x27; which was a top 5 hit in the UK. Cowell had worked with Stock on previous occasions with artists such as Sinitta, for whom Stock wrote and produced various hits like &quot;Toy Boy&quot; in 1987. Stock again collaborated with Cowell in 1993 on the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) album &quot;&quot; which spawned the No. 4 hit &quot;Slam Jam&quot;.

In 1994 Stock produced several artists for Simon Cowell including Kym Mazelle, Jocelyn Brown and Robson and Jerome. Their cover of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; produced by Stock and Aitken became the highest selling non-charity single of the decade, remaining at No. 1 for 7 weeks in 1995 selling 2.5 million copies. Stock produced a further two No. 1 singles with Robson and Jerome and two No. 1 albums.

After several years producing hits for Stock&#x27;s own label &#x27;Love This Records&#x27; and with Simon Cowell for BMG/RCA, the structural integrity of Stock&#x27;s studio became compromised by the tunnelling of the Jubilee Line extension, and the damage forced Stock to pursue legal action against London Underground. As a result, Stock was forced to pull out of a joint deal with Cowell and BMG to produce several artists including the band Westlife in 1996.

In 1997, Stock produced a version of &quot;You Can Do Magic&quot; (the biggest of three hit singles Limmie &amp; Family Cookin&#x27; had in the UK charts in the 1970s) under the name The Mojams, for an investigation on ITV programme &quot;The Cook Report&quot; into chart rigging. Fronted by Edwina Currie&#x27;s daughter Debbie (then a trainee journalist for the production company Central Television), the single, credited to The Mojams featuring Debbie Currie, was released by Gotham Records and peaked at number 86 in the UK singles chart. Stock got involved in the investigation after a number of his records&#x27; sales had been disqualified from the UK singles chart with Love This Records having been seen as a company involved in chart hyping/chart rigging by the BPI (in regards to the Top 40 hit &quot;Santa Maria&quot; by Tatjana Šimić).

In 1998 Stock and Aitken teamed up with Steve Crosby who had created the group Steps, to form the band Scooch. Their first single &quot;When My Baby&quot; reached No. 29 and their follow up, &quot;More Than I Needed to Know&quot;, was a top 5 hit in the UK in 2000 and went to No. 1 in Japan. Scooch&#x27;s album &quot;Four Sure&quot; spawned two more top 20 singles. Stock also scored a top 20 with &quot;Airhead&quot; by girl band Girls@Play, with EastEnders&#x27; star Rita Simons that toured with Steps.

In 2003 Stock formed the label Better the Devil Records and had a huge hit with the &quot;Fast Food Song&quot; reaching #2 in the UK Charts and selling 200,000 CD singles. Stock wrote and produced two further singles for the Fast Food Rockers including the top 10 &quot;Smile Please&quot;.

==Recent==
In 2005 Stock briefly teamed up with Pete Waterman to write and produce a single for The Sheilas, a novelty group created by the Sheilas&#x27; Wheels car insurance brand and again in 2010, collaborating on the UK&#x27;s entry in the Eurovision Song Contest, &quot;That Sounds Good To Me&quot;.

Most recently Stock formed the company &#x27;The Show 4 Kids&#x27;. Stock created the pop musical-The Go!Go!Go! Show with Steve Crosby to popular and critical acclaim, featuring new songs written and produced by Stock and Crosby. The Go!Go!Go! Show debuted at the Leicester Square Theatre, London in July 2010 and was performed daily at Alton Towers through the entirety of their 2011 season as their resident attraction. During the summer of 2011 The Go!Go!Go! Show began a regional tour of theatres across the UK finishing at the Garrick Theatre, London in October.

In summer 2012 The Go!Go!Go! Show debuted a new live show at the Empire Cinema in London&#x27;s Leicester Square. It marked the first time in over 50 years that the famous venue has hosted live entertainment. Later that year The Go!Go!Go! Show was commissioned by Nickelodeon for television. It will air on UK channel Nick Jr from April 2013.

In 2013, Stock worked on a cartoon character called The Retrobot, which was an 80&#x27;s robot who was fed up with modern culture. That Christmas, the character released a song called &quot;Christmas Robot&quot; which went viral, but did not compete for the Christmas chart. The Retrobot did parody covers, a Radio 1 Live Lounge version of &quot;Christmas Robot&quot;, and, a short time afterwards, a short lived comedy news channel.

In 2014, Stock worked with Shayne Ward on his comeback album &quot;Closer&quot;. Stock co-wrote and produced all 14 tracks on the album. &quot;Closer&quot; was released on 12 April 2015 reaching number 17 in the UK charts and hit Number 2 on the UK Independent Album Charts.

Summer 2015 also showed renewed work with Nicki French with the single &quot;This Love&quot;.

In December 2015 Stock Aitken Waterman teamed up to produce a remix of Kylie Minogue&#x27;s Every Day&#x27;s Like Christmas in the style of Minogue&#x27;s earlier hits with the trio. It was received very well by fans and critics. Rob Corpsey from The Official Chart Company stated &quot;OK so this is pretty much the Christmas song to end all Christmas songs; a massive sugar rush of classic, candy-coated late 80s pop wrapped up in a big shiny red bow. Oh, and did we mention Kylie&#x27;s singing on it?&quot; He concluded &quot;it&#x27;s no wonder this latest offering is so good, because they&#x27;ve clearly got chemistry. We can&#x27;t get enough of this and we reckon you&#x27;ll feel the same...&quot;

In 2016 Stock confirmed that he was working with young singer Chloe Rose on a single for NSPCC&#x27;s ChildLine 30 year anniversary. Stock agreed to produce the single as he had also written and produced the very first Childline single &quot;You&#x27;ve Got A Friend&quot; by Big Fun &amp; Sonia. The song &quot;For Me&quot; was performed first at England Captain Wayne Rooney&#x27;s testimonial match at Old Trafford on 3 August and released on 9 September in aid of the Wayne Rooney Foundation supporting NSPCC and ChildLine. The music video &quot;For Me&quot; premiered on Rose&#x27;s VEVO channel on 15 August.

In 2017 Stock worked with The Fizz (formerly Bucks Fizz). Stock co-wrote and produced the album &quot;The F-Z of Pop&quot; - the group&#x27;s first studio album in over 33 years. It was released in September 2017 and charted at #25 in the UK charts and #6 in the UK independent Charts.

Stock has subsequently produced two further albums with The Fizz including &quot;Christmas With The Fizz&quot; in 2018 and &quot;Smoke &amp; Mirrors&quot; in 2020. On 6 March 2020 the album was released and entered the overall Official Albums Chart at No.29, the UK Sales Chart at No.6, the UK Vinyl Chart at No.5 and the Independent Chart at No.3. The album also scored the No.6 position on the Official Scottish Album Charts.

Of the album Classic Pop Magazine said &quot;The Fizz are back firing on all cylinders with Smoke &amp; Mirrors – an album of shiny new pop bangers, the latest fruit of a fertile collaboration with legendary hitmaker Mike Stock&quot;. Commenting on the songs, it said that &quot;All We Ever Can Do&quot; and &quot;Boomerang&quot; illustrate the group&#x27;s &quot;extraordinary resilience&quot;, while &quot;The World We Left Behind&quot; sees them &quot;laying to rest a few old ghosts&quot;.

<doc id="280983" wikidata="Q286612" url="?curid=280983" title="Maria, Queen of Sicily">
<text>Maria (2 July 1363 – 25 May 1401) was Queen of Sicily and Duchess of Athens and Neopatria from 1377 until her death.

== Accession to the Sicilian Throne ==

Born in Catania, Maria was the daughter and heir of Frederick the Simple by his first wife Constance of Aragon. After her father&#x27;s death in 1377, she ascended the Sicilian throne. Her government, however, was effectively taken over. She was only thirteen years old at the time, and the four baronial families who claimed her power styled themselves &quot;vicars.&quot;

One of the Vicars, Artale Alagona, was previously named regent by Maria&#x27;s father. In 1360—seventeen years before Queen Maria&#x27;s ascension—Alagona had burnt and razed to the ground Augusta, an important fortified city, using forces from Syracuse and Catania. However, Alagona&#x27;s regency failed because of conflicts between the &quot;Sicilian&quot; and &quot;Aragonese&quot; parties, and he was forced to form a government with three other Vicars instead. The four baronial families were chosen to represent and equally distribute power between the Sicilian and Aragonese factions.

== Unrest during the Vicars&#x27; Reign ==

Starting in 1377, the Kingdom of Sicily was ruled by four Vicars: Artale I Alagona, Count of Mistretta, Francesco II Ventimiglia, Count of Geraci, Manfredi III Chiaramonte, Count of Modica, and Guglielmo Peralta, Count of Caltabellotta. The composition of the College of Vicars was intended to include a parity of exponents of the &quot;Sicilian&quot; and &quot;Aragonese&quot; parties. However, the four men ruled effectively in their separate baronial lands alone. In 1379, Queen Maria was kidnapped by Guglielmo Raimondo III of Moncada, Marquis of Malta and Gozzo, a Sicilian nobleman and member of the Aragonese House of Montcada, who had been specifically excluded from the government by Alagona. Moncada intended to prevent Maria&#x27;s planned marriage to Giangaleazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan, and held her for two years first at Augusta, then at Licata. Moncada&#x27;s actions had been approved by Maria&#x27;s grandfather, King Peter IV of Aragon, but naturally provoked opposition, particularly by his rivals Alagona and Chiaramonte, who proceeded to attack Moncada&#x27;s fortresses. In 1381, Moncada turned Maria over to the envoys of Peter IV, and in 1382 she was rescued from the advancing forces of Chiaramonte by an Aragonese fleet; she was taken first to Sardinia, then, in 1384, to Aragon, where she was married to her cousin Martin of Aragon in 1390.

== Co-reign with Martin the Younger ==

In 1392 Maria and Martin returned with a military force and defeated the opposing barons, ruling jointly until Maria&#x27;s death in 1401. At that time, Martin repudiated the Treaty of Villeneuve (1372) and ruled Sicily alone. She also survived their only son, Peter (1398–1400). The kingdom remained without a crown prince and this caused a succession crisis for Martin, who ruled by right of his wife. Frederick the Simple had named his illegitimate son, Guglielmo, Count of Malta, as heir presumptive in the case of the extinction of his daughter&#x27;s line. Guglielmo had died in c. 1380, but he had a daughter, Giovanna, wife of the Sicilian nobleman Pietro di Gioeni. She, however, cannot have contested her uncle&#x27;s claim since Martin continued to rule unopposed until his death.

Maria of Sicily died at Lentini in 1401.

<text>Sonia Evans (born 13 February 1971), known mononymously as Sonia, is an English pop singer from Liverpool. She had a 1989 UK number one hit with &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Stop Me Loving You&quot; and became the first female UK artist to achieve five top 20 hit singles from one album. She represented the United Kingdom in the 1993 Eurovision Song Contest, where she finished second with the song &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot;. 

Between 1989 and 1993, she had 11 UK top 30 hits, including &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot; (1989), &quot;Counting Every Minute&quot; (1990) and &quot;Only Fools (Never Fall in Love)&quot; (1991). In 1994, she starred as Sandy in a West End revival of the musical &quot;Grease&quot;, while on television she appeared as Bunty in the 1998 BBC comedy series &quot;The Lily Savage Show&quot;.

==Career==
===&quot;Everybody Knows&quot; and breakthrough (1990–1993)===
Sonia was signed to Chrysalis Records after badgering Pete Waterman to listen to her sing outside his recording studio in Liverpool. Waterman called her bluff and asked her to sing live on his weekly radio show. Sonia&#x27;s debut single, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Stop Me Loving You&quot;, composed and produced by the songwriting and music production trio Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman (Stock Aitken Waterman) was released in June 1989. &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Stop Me Loving You&quot; peaked at number 1 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks the following month. At 18, Sonia became one of the youngest female British singers to achieve this feat. The single also topped the Irish chart and reached the top 10 of the US dance chart.

Sonia&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;, was released in April 1990. The album peaked at number 7 in the UK, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. All five singles released from the album became top 20 hits in the UK, making Sonia the first British solo female artist to achieve this. Sonia achieved a sixth top 20 hit in the UK in 1990 with &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;, recorded with the group Big Fun, and released as a charity single for Childline.

Sonia left her record label and released her second, self-titled album in 1991, produced by Nigel Wright. The first single released from it, &quot;Only Fools (Never Fall in Love)&quot; became Sonia&#x27;s third UK top 10 hit, although the album was less successful than her debut. Sonia also contributed to two charity singles, Band Aid II&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; in 1989 (peaked at number 1 in the UK) and Gulf Aid&#x27;s &quot;As Time Stood Still&quot; in 1991.

===Eurovision and &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot; (1992–1993)===

In 1993, Sonia represented the United Kingdom in the 1993 Eurovision Song Contest, singing the Dean Collinson and Brian Teasdale composition &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot;. She was placed second in the contest. Her third album, also titled &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot; was released that year and reached number 32 in the UK. Sonia performed the song again on Saturday, 13 May 2023, during the interval at the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in Liverpool, 30 years after her first appearance. The day before, she also appeared in &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; (see TV appearances below) performing her iconic Eurovision entry to the cast at an on-screen Eurovision party.

In 1994, Sonia replaced singer Debbie Gibson as Sandy in the West End musical &quot;Grease&quot;. A cover of &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; was released as a tie-in single, but it only peaked at number 61 in the UK. In 1995, Sonia released a cover of &quot;Wake Up Everybody&quot;, which did not enter the UK top 100. It was to be the lead single of her fourth album, the soul covers album &quot;Love Train – The Philly Album&quot;, but Sonia was unhappy with it and it only received a promotional release. Sonia performed a vocal part in Italian Eurobeat singer Nuage&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Never Gonna Let You Down and Forget You&quot;, released in Japan in 2004, produced by Dave Rodgers.

===Theatre and acting (1993–2010)===
Prior to her music career, around 1988, Evans appeared as an extra in Channel 4&#x27;s soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot;, and also appeared in an episode of the BBC1 situation comedy &quot;Bread&quot;, where she played Ellia, a short-term girlfriend of Adrian Boswell, in episode 11 of series 4. In 1990, Sonia co-hosted children&#x27;s game show &quot;The Wetter the Better&quot; as a scoreboard person with main quizmaster Ross King, which was part of the Saturday morning children&#x27;s magazine show &quot;8:15 from Manchester&quot;. In 1993, Sonia made her theatre debut in the musical &quot;Slice of Saturday Night&quot;, alongside Dennis Waterman. The following year she replaced singer Debbie Gibson as Sandy in a West End revival of &quot;Grease&quot;, where she stayed for a year. In 1997, she returned to the stage on the musical &quot;What A Feeling!&quot;, which also included fellow 1980s stars Luke Goss and Sinitta. An accompanying soundtrack album was released.

She has also played alongside Lily Savage as her wayward daughter Bunty Savage, both on the BBC series &quot;The Lily Savage Show&quot; and live shows.
Also in 1993, Sonia represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest. It was held in Millstreet, county Cork in Ireland. She sang &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot; and finished second. In 2003, Sonia appeared in the ITV1 reality show &quot;Reborn in the USA&quot;, where former pop stars including Leee John from the band Imagination, Michelle Gayle, Gina G, Elkie Brooks and pop duo Dollar performed American hits. The show saw the artists touring America and each week one artist was eliminated from the show. Sonia came sixth out of the nine participants. In January 2007, she starred in the pantomime &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; as Jack in Horsham, West Sussex, alongside Mark Curry. Sonia also starred in the pantomime &quot;Cinderella&quot; in December 2010 / January 2011 as the Wicked Queen Edwina at the Stiwt Theatre in Wrexham, North Wales, alongside &quot;Big Brother&quot; star Dale Howard.

Late 2007 saw the release of Sonia&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. However, this compilation only featured recordings from Sonia&#x27;s two albums released on BMG. In 2007, prior to Sonia&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; release, she recorded two Motown-influenced songs, &quot;Dancing in the Driver&#x27;s Seat&quot; and &quot;Your Heart or Mine&quot;, both of which were written by Barry Upton and U.S. songwriter Gordon Pogoda. However, her record label decided to include no new songs on &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; so both tracks remained unreleased until 2018. In 2008, Sonia recorded a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;She Loves You&quot; for the &quot;Liverpool – The Number Ones Album&quot;. On 1 June 2009, Sonia released her first single in 14 years, &quot;Fool for Love&quot;.

===Television and re–issues (2010–2023)===

In October 2010, the &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; album was remastered and re-issued in expanded form, containing two additional tracks, extended versions of her first four singles, and a demo version of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Stop Me Loving You&quot;. Also in 2010, Sonia&#x27;s cover version of &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;, a duet with Big Fun, was released on a reissue of the group&#x27;s debut album. On 21 December 2012, Sonia performed at the Stock Aitken Waterman &quot;Hit Factory Live&quot; reunion concert at The O2 in London, along with many other former SAW acts, including Kylie Minogue. In summer 2018, in conjunction with her appearance in the Channel 5 program &quot;Celebrity 5 Go Caravanning&quot;, Sonia&#x27;s recording of &quot;Dancing in the Driver&#x27;s Seat&quot;, written by Barry Upton and Gordon Pogoda, was released. Another song recorded with Upton and Pogoda in 2007, &quot;Your Heart or Mine&quot;, was released in 2018 as its follow-up. Sonia signed a new record deal with Energise Records in 2019, and a new single, &quot;A Night That&#x27;s Never Ending&quot;, was released in November 2019.

She appeared on series 5 of &quot;Hacker Time&quot;. In 2018, Sonia appeared alongside Todd Carty, Tony Blackburn, Colin Baker and Sherrie Hewson in Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity 5 Go Caravanning&quot;. Sonia made a significant guest appearance as herself in Channel 4 soap opera, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, in the episode aired Friday, 12 May 2023. In the storyline, Sonia is an old school friend of Diane O&#x27;Connor, played by Alexandra Fletcher, and the two are part of an in-joke where Sonia remarks Diane &quot;doesn&#x27;t look a day over 50&quot; (a reference to the age discrepancy between the two, Fletcher was born in 1976, and Sonia in 1971), and then Sonia asks Diane if her father is still running &#x27;The Moby&#x27;. This is a reference to Fletcher&#x27;s previous long-running role in &quot;Brookside&quot;, as Jacqui Dixon (from 1990 to 2003, produced by the same production company, and in which, Sonia herself was an extra in 1988), whose father, Ron, ran a mobile mini-market from a blue van with a white whale painted down the side called The Moby Dick. Sonia performed her 1993 Eurovision Song Contest song, &quot;Better The Devil You Know&quot;, at a party while Diane danced as one of her backing singers.

===Eurovision and &quot;Now! Musical&quot; (2023–present)===

Sonia was a prominent advocate and supporter for Liverpool&#x27;s bid to host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest. The city was announced as the winner in October 2022, beating the largest city in Scotland, Glasgow, who finished runner up. Ahead of the 2023 contest, Sonia was a prominent feature in the promotion of the contest being held in Liverpool, including a &quot;Spot Sonia&quot; competition held throughout the city, giving the public a chance to win tickets to the contest. During the Grand Final, Sonia performed her 1993 UK Eurovision entry &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot; as the interval act.

In 2024, it was announced that Sonia was cast as a special guest in the musical theatre production &quot;Now! That&#x27;s What I Call a Musical&quot; which was directed and choreographed by Craig Revel Horwood. She featured as the sole special guest star on the Scottish dates of the production at the King&#x27;s Theatre in Glasgow between 18–22 February 2025. Sonia did not feature as the guest in some of the dates, instead, singer Sinitta was cast as the special guest for some performances.

==Personal life==
Sonia was born on 13 February 1971. She married Mark Moses in 1998 and the couple have a daughter, who was born in 2010.

<text>Martin I of Sicily (c. 1374/1376 – 25 July 1409), called the Younger, was King of Sicily from his marriage to Queen Maria in 1390 until his death in 1409.

Martin&#x27;s father was the future King Martin I of Aragon, and his grandparents were King Peter IV of Aragon and Eleanor of Sicily. In February 1390 he married Maria of Sicily, born in 1362/1363. In 1392 he returned with Maria to Sicily with a military force and defeated a group of opposing barons. In 1394 the couple had their only son Peter, crown prince of Sicily, who died in 1400. He ruled Sicily jointly with Maria until her death at Lentini on 25 May 1401. At that time, he repudiated the Treaty of Villeneuve (1372) and ruled Sicily alone. After his death in 1409 in Cagliari, Sardinia, his father, by then king of Aragon, ruled Sicily as Martin II.

After Maria&#x27;s death Martin I the Younger married at Catania on 21 May 1402 by proxy and on 26 December 1402 in person Blanche of Navarre, who was heiress of the Evreux family and the future queen of Navarre, by whom he had an only son Martin in 1403, who died in Valencia in 1407. No offspring of his two marriages survived childhood; the only issue he left was a bastard son by Sicilian-born Tarsia Rizzari, Fadrique of Aragon, Count of Luna and Ejerica and Lord of Segorbe, born in 1400/1403, whom Martin II tried to make his successor in the Aragonese Empire. But the effort failed, and Fadrique was denied the succession by the Pact of Caspe. Fadrique married Yolande Louise (Violante Luisa) de Mur and died at Urena in 1438 without issue.

He also left a bastard daughter by Sicilian-born Agathe de Pesce, named Violante of Aragon, who died c. 1428. She was married twice: first in 1405 as the second wife (some say she was his mistress) to Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Count de Niebla (1371–1436); and second, she married Enrique&#x27;s cousin Martín de Guzmán.

Martin the Younger led the troops in the conquest of Sardinia in 1409, decisively defeating the ruler of Arborea at the Battle of Sanluri just before his own death.

<text>Stock Aitken Waterman (abbreviated as SAW and also known as the Hit Factory) are an English songwriting and record production trio consisting of Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman. The trio had great success from the mid-1980s through to the early-1990s. SAW is considered one of the most successful songwriting and producing partnerships of all time by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, scoring more than 100 UK Top 40 hits (many of which were also worldwide successes) and earning an estimated £60 million in royalties. The trio had thirteen UK No. 1 singles including three consecutive UK No. 1&#x27;s and three US No. 1 singles. They also had at least one record in the UK Top 100 Singles Chart every week between March 1986 and October 1990.

The group have sold 500 million units globally, and they also received a Brit Award for Best British Producer in 1987 along with nine Ivor Novello Awards between 1988 and 1990. In 1990 SAW picked up three Ivor Novello Awards for Songwriter of the Year, Most Performed Work for Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;This Time I Know It&#x27;s for Real&quot; and Best Selling A-Side for Jason Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Too Many Broken Hearts&quot;.

SAW started producing underground club hits, but earned worldwide success with a mixture of hi-NRG-influenced sound, romantic Motown lyrics and Italo disco melodies with singles from Rick Astley, Bananarama, Mel and Kim, Donna Summer, Sinitta, Dead or Alive, Jason Donovan and Kylie Minogue. During 1984–1989, their musical style was labelled Eurobeat. They also put swing shuffle elements into their songs. The producers&#x27; legacy has been increasingly positively reassessed, with contemporary analysts praising the quality and enduring impact of their music.

==History==
===Formation and early hits: Divine, Hazell Dean, Dead or Alive (1984–1985)===
Musician Mike Stock had briefly worked with DJ Pete Waterman in 1980 when John Milton, Mark Stock and Mike wrote a song – &quot;One Nine for a Lady Breaker&quot; – for a CB radio club. A version of the track found its way to Waterman who managed Peter Collins, then a successful producer with acts like Musical Youth and Nik Kershaw. The track was re-recorded and produced by Collins; Stock sang on the track under the alias Chris Britton. In January 1984, Stock and songwriter Matt Aitken arranged to meet Waterman at his office in the Stiff Records building, Camden Town. Waterman was seeking a new partnership and in February they went into the Marquee Studio in Wardour Street Soho to record the song &quot;The Upstroke&quot; for Agents Aren&#x27;t Aeroplanes - a front for their concept of a female Frankie Goes To Hollywood. The record was released on Proto Records run by Barry Evangeli and Nick East and distributed by RCA and was championed by Radio 1&#x27;s John Peel. It achieved popularity in the gay clubs and discos where many new records were promoted into the mainstream as Hi-NRG.

In 1983, Stock had been approached by Andy Paul, a Greek Cypriot, to write a song for Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest. &quot;Anna Maria Lena&quot; was voted by the Cypriot public to represent their country in the competition and the re-recorded version would be Stock and Aitken&#x27;s second collaboration with Waterman. The team were then asked to produce a song for drag performer Divine and they recorded &quot;You Think You&#x27;re a Man&quot; at the Marquee Studio, which was released by Proto Records in July 1984. The song reached No. 16 on the UK Singles Chart. Soon after, the team recorded Hazell Dean&#x27;s &quot;Whatever I Do, (Wherever I Go)&quot;. The song became Stock Aitken Waterman&#x27;s first Top 10 hit, reaching No. 4 in the UK. This period saw a rapid refining of the core production team and their roles, with a fourth collaborator, Pete Ware, who was co-credited on the team&#x27;s earliest records, leaving after Stock and Aitken objected to him taking a job touring with Dean.

In September 1984, SAW were approached by Dead or Alive frontman Pete Burns to produce the song &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot;, which became SAW&#x27;s first UK No. 1 in March 1985. Although a massive commercial success, the trio were still in dire financial straits and the record set the scene for SAW&#x27;s often fractious creative relationship with those bands and artists who demanded creative involvement in their records. Engineer Phil Harding, who mixed the track, said tensions were running so high between the band members and producers Stock and Aitken during mixing, that it almost escalated to violence. Stock has disputed the seriousness of studio tensions, alleging that Burns, Harding and Waterman have all &quot;exaggerated&quot; what happened in their recounting of events.

===The Hit Factory: Bananarama, Mel and Kim, Princess (1985–1986)===
In 1985, the trio built a new studio at The Vineyard recording studio complex, The Borough, which would later be dubbed &quot;The Hit Factory&quot;. Whilst working with the band Brilliant, Stock wrote a song for their backing singer Desiree Heslop called &quot;Say I&#x27;m Your Number One&quot;, which peaked at No. 7 on the UK Singles Chart. These chart successes and the trio&#x27;s sound attracted the attention of girl group Bananarama towards the end of 1985. Group member Siobhan Fahey wanted to record a cover version of Shocking Blue&#x27;s hit song &quot;Venus&quot;. The result was a pop/hi-NRG reworking which became a worldwide chart hit, reaching No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in July 1986 and reaching the Top 10 in the UK and many other countries.

Bananarama went on to make Stock, Aitken and Waterman their main producers, and would collaborate with them on some of their biggest hits, including &quot;Love in the First Degree&quot; (UK No. 3), &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; (UK No. 20), and &quot;I Heard a Rumour&quot; (UK No. 14). The act were one of only a few who were given co-writing credits with the producers, with Stock describing the creative relationship as challenging; explaining he was obliged to collaborate with them due to a deal with their management. &quot;It&#x27;s very difficult to be creative if someone&#x27;s just going to mock you, or laugh at you,&quot; he said. &quot;With Bananarama it was just awkward, all the time very awkward, and I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable writing with them.&quot; In 1986, Mel and Kim&#x27;s first single &quot;Showing Out (Get Fresh at the Weekend)&quot; went to No. 3 on the UK charts and their follow-up &quot;Respectable&quot; reached No. 1.

===Rick Astley, Ferry Aid (1987)===
In 1987, Rick Astley recorded the team&#x27;s biggest hit – &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; – though initially Stock and Aitken were unsure of its appeal with Astley&#x27;s strong but unorthodox voice. When it was released by RCA, &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; went straight to No. 1 in 17 different countries including America and the UK where it became the biggest selling record of 1987. Astley&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Together Forever&quot; also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. That year SAW produced &quot;Let It Be&quot; in aid of the victims involved in the Zeebrugge Ferry disaster, and Stock got the chance to work with his musical inspiration Paul McCartney whose original recordings of the Beatles were sent to the production team by producer George Martin. &quot;Let It Be&quot; went to No. 1 in the UK where it stayed for three weeks. In 1989, SAW would have another No. 1 with McCartney on the Gerry and the Pacemakers hit – &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; – recorded to raise funds for the victims and their families of the Hillsborough Disaster.

===The assembly line===
Following their early success, SAW&#x27;s style evolved into a more mainstream synthpop, typically performed by attractive singers. Their usual method for creating the music was to write the songs themselves, although some of their early artists wrote or co-wrote their own material. Next they would record the music with extensive use of synthesizers, drum machines (drums were often credited to &quot;A Linn&quot;, a reference to the Linn brand of drum machine) and sequencers; and then finally bring in a singer solely to record the vocal track. Pete Burns would criticise SAW for their methods, describing that &quot;they took our sound and just basically wheeled it off with a load of other imbeciles, and that makes me a bit sour.&quot;

SAW&#x27;s early work was recorded and mixed at Marquee Studios in Wardour Street, where Phil Harding and Rob Waldron worked with them on &quot;Youthquake&quot;. Waldron went to work as an assistant engineer to Harding when Waterman opened his new studio in Borough, London.&lt;ref name=&quot;gov.uk/company/09842765&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ukpostcodecheck/ea5f848f&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Waldron became the chief recording engineer and Linn 9000 programmer (A Linn) and Harding was the mixer/remixer.

The tendency toward interchanging artists and repertoire was well established when Rick Astley&#x27;s breakout album &quot;Whenever You Need Somebody&quot; got its name and title track from a minor hit the trio had produced a year earlier for O&#x27;Chi Brown. Similarly, many of their songs were tried out and recorded by multiple artists; Mel and Kim, Pepsi and Shirlie and Sinitta all recorded the song &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Catch You&quot;, both Kylie Minogue and Mandy Smith recorded &quot;Got To Be Certain&quot;, whilst Mel and Kim, Carol Hitchcock and Hazell Dean gave vocals for &quot;More Than Words Can Say&quot;. Their prodigious, production line–like output and similar song structures led to them being referred to as the Hit Factory, and attracted criticism from many quarters, including &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, who unflatteringly dubbed the team, &quot;Schlock, Aimless and Waterdown&quot;.

===Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Band Aid II (1988–1989)===
In 1987, Waterman formed PWL (the in-house label of SAW) and one of the first artists to be released on the label was Australian soap star, Kylie Minogue. Stock was informed by Minogue&#x27;s manager, Terry Blamey, that she had been in London for ten days waiting to work with SAW though Waterman had not informed Stock. By the time Minogue entered the studio, she was due on a plane back to Australia later that day. In forty minutes Stock and Aitken had written the song, &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot;, recorded a backing track and Minogue&#x27;s vocals. The single was released by PWL in February 1988 and climbed to the No. 1 spot in March where it stayed for five weeks, the joint longest running No. 1 of 1988. It also went to No. 1 in 25 other territories including Minogue&#x27;s native country Australia.

With demand for a follow-up single, Minogue was not keen on returning to England to work with SAW again after the rushed treatment she had received. Stock flew to Australia to meet Minogue and her parents at her Melbourne home to apologise and successfully convinced her to record a follow-up single &quot;Got to Be Certain&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the UK charts. When her debut album &quot;Kylie&quot; was released in August 1988 it sold 2.8 million copies. Minogue spent more weeks on the singles chart that year than any other artist. Minogue went on to record three more studio albums with SAW, scoring fifteen successive Top 10 UK hits including &quot;Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi&quot; (No. 2), &quot;Hand on Your Heart&quot; (No. 1), &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t Change a Thing&quot; (No. 2), &quot;Tears on My Pillow&quot; (No. 1), &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot; (No. 2) and &quot;Shocked&quot; (No. 6).

Soon after, Jason Donovan&#x27;s first single, &quot;Nothing Can Divide Us&quot;, became a Top 5 hit in both England and Australia. Donovan&#x27;s next single, &quot;Especially for You&quot;, a duet with Kylie Minogue, went to No. 1 in January 1989. A duet had not initially been planned by SAW until retailer Woolworth&#x27;s had taken huge orders for hundreds of thousands before the song had even been written. Stock wrote &quot;Especially for You&quot;, sang the demo with a SAW backing singer and Aitken flew to Australia to record Minogue and Donovan&#x27;s vocals in time for a Christmas release. Donovan returned to the studio to record the song &quot;Too Many Broken Hearts&quot;, which went to No. 1 in March 1989. His debut album &quot;Ten Good Reasons&quot; also held to the top spot for three weeks, selling 1.5 million copies. Donovan went on to have numerous successful singles with SAW, including the No. 1 hit &quot;Sealed with a Kiss&quot;, &quot;Every Day (I Love You More)&quot; (No. 2), and the Christmas No. 2 record &quot;When You Come Back to Me&quot;, kept off the top spot by the Band Aid II SAW record &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;.

===Donna Summer, Cliff Richard and later work (1989–1993)===
In 1989, SAW had their most successful year with seven UK No. 1&#x27;s (a feat equalled only by George Martin in 1963) and fifteen Top 5 hits. During that year, SAW wrote and produced over seven albums&#x27; worth of material for artists such as Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Bananarama, Donna Summer, Cliff Richard and Paul McCartney. The team supplied Summer with her &quot;This Time I Know It&#x27;s for Real&quot;, which became her biggest hit in the United Kingdom since 1979, reaching No. 3, and becoming Summer&#x27;s final Top 10 hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In January 1990, SAW had their last UK No. 1 single, Minogue&#x27;s cover of &quot;Tears on My Pillow&quot;. SAW also produced Cliff Richard&#x27;s No. 3 single &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Have the Heart&quot; and gave 18-year-old singer Sonia a debut No. 1 with &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Stop Me Loving You&quot;.

Despite continued success in the early-1990s with Minogue&#x27;s singles and Lonnie Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Happenin&#x27; All Over Again&quot; (No. 4), the partnership began to disband. The week of 13 October 1990 became the first with no SAW-produced singles in the UK Top 75 in over two years. In mid-1991, Aitken left the team due to stress and deep dissatisfaction with business and creative decisions made by Waterman. Stock stayed with Waterman to write and produce Minogue&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get to It&quot;, Sybil&#x27;s 1993 hits, &quot;The Love I Lost&quot; (No. 3) and &quot;When I&#x27;m Good and Ready&quot; (No. 5), and Boy Krazy&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s What Love Can Do&quot; (which made it to No. 18 in the US). Later that year, Stock ended his relationship with Waterman following a disagreement over their finances; by the end of their partnership, SAW had written and/or produced over 300 Top 75 hits and 30 platinum albums.

===Recent times===
In 2005, the three producers reunited again and released a CD+DVD album, &quot;Stock Aitken Waterman Gold&quot;, with some of their best-known and most successful singles. In 2007, SAW released the Sheilas&#x27; single &quot;(I&#x27;m So) Happy Happy (You&#x27;re Mine)&quot;, which reached No. 91 in the UK. A reunion concert event called &quot;Hit Factory Live&quot; took place ion 21 December 2012 at London&#x27;s O2 Arena featuring many of the acts associated with Waterman&#x27;s record labels. In December 2015, SAW made a return producing a remix of the Chris Martin-written Minogue song &quot;Every Day&#x27;s Like Christmas&quot;.

Stock and Waterman collaborated on the UK Eurovision 2010 entry &quot;That Sounds Good to Me&quot;. It was revealed in the final round of &quot;&quot; on BBC One, in which Josh Dubovie eventually earned the right to perform the song at the contest. He finished in 25th place in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010, receiving 10 points in total.

In 2023, the trio reunited for the filming of the Channel 5 documentary &quot;Legends of Pop: Stock Aitken Waterman&quot;, each giving interviews both individually and as a group. On 21 March 2023, it was announced that a musical entitled &quot;I Should Be So 
Lucky&quot;, making use of SAW songs, would premiere at the Manchester Opera House before embarking on a UK tour. The musical is written and directed by the creator of the &quot;Nativity!&quot; franchise, Debbie Isitt, and choreographed by Jason Gilkison, the creative director of Strictly Come Dancing.
