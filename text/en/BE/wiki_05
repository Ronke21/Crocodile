<text>Memory distrust syndrome is a condition first described by Gísli Guðjónsson and James MacKeith in 1982, in which an individual doubts the accuracy of their memory concerning the content and context of events of which they have experienced. Since the individual does not trust their own memory, they will commonly depend on outside sources of information rather than using their ability for recollection. Some believe that this may be a defense or coping mechanism to a preexisting faulty memory state such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, amnesia, or possibly dementia.

The condition is generally considered to be related to source amnesia, which involves the inability to recall the basis for factual knowledge. The main difference between the two is that source amnesia is a lack of knowing the basis of knowledge, whereas memory distrust syndrome is a lack of trust in the knowledge that exists. The latter implies an individual’s reason or belief that would prevent them from trusting their recollections. Cases concerning memory distrust syndrome have led to documented false confessions in court cases.

==Symptoms==
The main symptom of memory distrust syndrome is the lack of belief in one&#x27;s own memory, and, a reliance on outside sources for information as a side effect. The individual may have their own memory, but will readily change it depending on chosen outside sources. Individuals may alter their recollections when contrary information is suggested, even though their memory may be true, due to the distrust in their memory.

For example, a person has a memory of a house and recalls it to be white. Then, a trusted family member begins talking with them and suggests that it was red instead. The afflicted individual will then believe the house was red despite their recollection of it being white. It is unknown if the person&#x27;s memory of the house is permanently altered; however, they will say that the house was red regardless of the memory&#x27;s condition.

Also, this does not necessarily allow for confabulatory memory fabrication. Currently it is not believed that an afflicted individual will readily believe an outside source on a memory of which the person is not involved, such as a randomly shared story. This further suggests that memory distrust syndrome solely alters the individual&#x27;s currently retrievable memories, and not randomized information.

==Causes==

It is normal to have some level of memory distrust, or the lack of trusting in one&#x27;s own memory. This may occur when speaking with your parents about your childhood, for example. However it seems that everyone has their own level of memory distrust, and memory distrust syndrome seems to be a severe case.

The direct cause is unknown; however, it is possibly a defense or coping mechanism to a preexisting condition that would alter one&#x27;s memory. This could involve frontal lobe lesions, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, amnesia, dementia, or other conditions. Any condition that would alter either existing memories or the formation of new memories could cause a coping scheme such as memory distrust syndrome. Alternatively, an individual may have learned over time to not trust their own memory from conditioning, and as such the individual would develop a defense mechanism to remove themselves from potential abuse.

==Mechanisms==
Not to be confused with false memory syndrome which involves the creation of memory which are factually incorrect, but strongly believed by the individual. Memory distrust syndrome (MDS) is the doubt of one&#x27;s own memory surrounding the content and context of events. Because of this, individuals rely on external sources of information as opposed to assuming their recollection is correct. It would seem as though some individuals have a tendency toward memory distrust to some degree naturally; however, MDS is a form of memory distrust heightened to the point that the individual will reject their own memory completely if provided with conflicting information. It has been connected to obsessive-compulsive disorder in that repeated checking of information would result in a distrust of the individual&#x27;s confidence of their memory.

The suggestibility of memory alteration provides the potential for radical mood alterations and feelings of inadequacy or futility. Typically, however, the individual will be aware of their condition and will be prepared for situations that may be difficult. A tendency to avoid memory recollection is possible due to the desire to avoid embarrassment or ridicule.

==Types of false memory==

===Spontaneous confabulation===

These occur typically in cases of amnesia and frontal lobe disorders. In &quot;spontaneous&quot; confabulations, there is a persistent, unprovoked outpouring of false memories in which intrusion errors or distortions are seen in response to a challenge to memory. They occur most commonly during autobiographical recall, but can occur other times as well. These errors occur in one of two ways: either there is an &quot;editing error&quot; or there is a &quot;source&quot; error.

There are several ideas as to why this editing error may occur.

*an issue with the rules of plausibility and association during memory retrieval, leaving the retrieved memory to be &quot;uninhibited&quot; or &quot;suppressed&quot;.
*a failure in the evaluation process of accessed memories. This is similar to Moscovitch&#x27;s idea, although his focuses on one&#x27;s capability of judgment while this one focuses on the judgment itself.
*spontaneous confabulation occurred due to &quot;the completely incoherent and context-free retrieval of memories and associations.”
*a deficit in three processes (description, editing, and mediator) which all contributed to confabulations in different ways.

Source errors are focused around the creation of the original memory or the memory storage process rather than the processes discussed above. These are less studied because they involve several variables including how an individual learns and perceives their environment, the environment itself, distractions, the individual&#x27;s weighing of important information, etc.

===Delusional memories and delusions===

These occur in psychiatric patients or individuals with psychiatric conditions. Delusional memories consist of either a true memory that gives rise to a deluded interpretation These can closely resemble spontaneous confabulations resulting from frontal lobe disease. They are also an absolute conviction and not up for debate. The individual believes the memory is completely true and accurate, and has a tendency toward being bizarre.

Similarly, delusions are a held conviction that the individual holds; however, it may not be due to a recollection of any specific event. Instead the conviction is rooted in beliefs based on related delusional memories or misconceptions. For example, an individual who has a conspiracy theory based on junk or mislabeled mail could have a delusion involving the mail and the government. However, there wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be any delusional memories to support it. It is simply a belief that has been created due to unhindered perception of events.

==Diagnostic tests==

Since the cause of memory distrust syndrome is unknown, there is no ultimate test to determine diagnosis. However, the following tests all involve memory accuracy, memory trust, and suggestibility.

===Squire Subjective Memory Questionnaire===

The Squire Subjective Memory Questionnaire if a self-report scale consisting of 18 items tapping subjective evaluations of one&#x27;s own memory. Items are scored on a 9-point scale (−4=disastrous; 4=perfect). Sample items are &#x27;My ability to
remember things that have happened more than a year ago is...&#x27; and &#x27;My ability to recall things when I really try is...&#x27; Scores are summed to obtain a total SSMQ score varying from −72 to 72, with negative scores corresponding with pessimistic judgments about one&#x27;s own memory and positive scores reflecting optimistic memory evaluations.

===Cognitive Failures Questionnaire===

The Cognitive Failures Questionnaire is a self-report scale that taps failures in everyday actions, perception and attention, and memory over the last month. It consists of 25 items that are scored on a 5-point scale (0=never; 4=very often). Illustrative items are &#x27;Do you fail to notice signposts on the road?&#x27; and &#x27;Do you forget where you put something
like a newspaper or a book?&#x27; Scores are summed to obtain a total CFQ score varying from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more self-reported cognitive failures.

===Gudjonsson Compliance Scale===

The Gudjonsson Compliance Scale is a self-report instrument that measures peoples&#x27; levels of compliance. It focuses on two types of behavior, namely eagerness to please others, and avoidance of conflicts. The scale consists of 20 items using
a true/false format. Examples are &#x27;I give in easily to people when I am pressured&#x27; and &#x27;I try hard to do what is expected of me&#x27;. After recoding items 17 to 19, a total GCS score varying from 0 to 20 can be obtained by summing the number of true responses, with higher scores indexing more compliant behavior.

===Gudjonsson suggestibility scale===

The Gudjonsson suggestibility scale (GSS) is used to measure interrogative suggestibility. The GSS consists of a story that is read out loud by a test administer. Participants then have to answer 20 questions of which 15 are misleading and 5 are neutral and address factual details of the story. After participants have answered the questions, they receive negative feedback about their performance. They are asked to answer the questions one more time and to be more accurate this time. Thus, all questions are answered twice and in this way several GSS parameters can be calculated. First, yield 1 refers to the number of misleading questions that the participant accepts during the first round (range 0–15). Second, yield 2 refers to the number of misleading questions accepted during the second round (range 0–15). Third, shift refers to the number of changes that participants make in their answers after having received negative feedback (range 0–20). Finally, the total GSS score is the sum of yield 1 and shift, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of interrogative suggestibility (range 0–35).

==Society and culture==
Memory distrust disorder has been shown to cause false confessions in court cases. This occurs when the suggestible individual is asked a question which leads them to believe that their recollection is incorrect. Due to their suggestibility and lack of trust in their own memory, they will either alter their own memory or be unsure of specific details.

A similar situation can occur while being interrogated by the authorities. The court system assumes that everyone is innocent until proven guilty; however, many times individuals are arrested for suspicion, which would simply require a motive and the lack of an alibi. The goal of an interrogator may be to increase and use a subject&#x27;s suggestibility. This would cause the capability of several inaccuracies to occur during the interrogation.

Studies have been performed on undiagnosed individuals and they have shown that minor detail alterations can and do easily go unnoticed. In a specific study, individuals were asked to watch a tape of a robbery and then recall details about it. A week later they were brought back in and read over a supposed copy of their written statement. However, this statement included minor alterations such as the number of people in the store at the time or what type of headgear the thief was wearing. Sometimes this individuals would notice the alterations, but other details went unnoticed, suggesting that undiagnosed individuals have a level of memory distrust. Details had been altered that were accepted as truth, regardless of what actual memory the individual could recall.

<doc id="273189" wikidata="Q7103172" url="?curid=273189" title="Orlando Renegades">
<text>The Orlando Renegades were a professional American football team that played in Orlando, Florida, in the United States Football League (USFL) for a single season in 1985. Before its season in Orlando, the franchise played in Washington, D.C., as the Washington Federals for two seasons, in 1983 and 1984.

The franchise was the worst in the USFL in terms of both game play – a combined record of 7-29-0 – and attendance during its two seasons in Washington, prompting the move to Orlando. In Orlando, attendance was better and the team&#x27;s performance on the field began to improve over the course of the season despite a 5–13 record, but the USFL folded before the team could play a second season in Orlando.

==In Washington==

===Creation of the franchise===
United States Football League founder Donald Dixon was a strong proponent of a USFL franchise in Washington, D.C., and insisted on one despite the dominance of the National Football League′s Washington Redskins in the Washington market. Real estate magnate Marvin Warner originally was slated to own the Federals, but when the USFL announced it was fielding a team in his hometown of Birmingham, Alabama – the team which became the Birmingham Stallions – Warner opted to take that franchise instead. The USFL then turned to prominent Washington attorney Berl Bernhard. He stood atop a murky ownership structure. The franchise was held by a limited partnership, Washington Football Partners, which was organized in the District of Columbia on August 20, 1982, with Bernhard&#x27;s Capital City Sports Management as general partner. In turn, Washington Football Partners was owned by a joint venture that was operated by three corporations.

Financial projections submitted to potential investors in Washington Football Partners foresaw the Federals losing $1.12 million during the 1983 season, with anticipated revenues of $4.13 million – including $2.6 million in ticket sales – and expenses of just over $5.25 million. The Federals&#x27; efforts were severely hobbled when the Redskins won Super Bowl XVII on January 30, 1983 – their first NFL championship since 1942 – only 36 days before the Federals′ first game. The Federals&#x27; already sluggish ticket sales dried up almost completely.

The Federals played in Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C. However, under pressure from the Redskins, the city refused to grant the Federals full access to its facilities. They were forced to practice on a small practice field across the street from a prison.

===1983 season===
The team lured Ray Jauch to be its head coach; he had previously guided the Edmonton Eskimos and Winnipeg Blue Bombers to success in the Canadian Football League. At the time he was the fourth-winningest coach in CFL history. The Federals initially made a splash by signing running back Craig James, one half of the famous &quot;Pony Express&quot; backfield at SMU.

More than any other team in the league, the Federals seemed dogged by inconsistency, bad timing, and terrible luck. A week before the season even began, their player personnel expert bolted to the NFL&#x27;s New York Jets. The team changed quarterbacks almost weekly, with in-game quarterback changes in a number of games. Jauch&#x27;s biggest mistake was probably giving the opening day starter, NFL veteran Kim McQuilken, the quick hook for rookie quarterback Mike Hohensee. From there the team never seemed to settle in with a quarterback for more than a few games in a row, and when McQuilken did play, he often pressed, forcing his throws into coverage. The team alternated between McQuilken and Hohensee, with occasional appearances by former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback &quot;Jefferson Street&quot; Joe Gilliam, who was far past his prime; he had last played a meaningful professional down in 1975, and he only threw for 673 yards. The only other quarterback on the team was rookie Mike Forslund, who never played.

Injuries also dogged the team. James was sidelined for five games with a fractured vertebra. Hohensee only played in nine games all season. At one point, all of the Federals′ receivers had leg injuries. The Federals had good linebackers in Joe Harris, Dan Lloyd, and Jeff McIntyre, who was Washington&#x27;s best outside linebacker and could cover receivers downfield and stop the run. McIntyre lead the team in tackles and sacks until an ankle injury sidelined him for the final six games.

The first game in franchise history was a portent of things to come; the Federals were drilled at RFK Stadium 28–7 by the Chicago Blitz, the preseason title favorites coached by former Washington Redskins coach George Allen. The game was played on March 6, 1983. The Blitz, led by former Detroit Lions and Baltimore Colts quarterback Greg Landry, raced out to a 28–0 lead. The Blitz held Washington to only one first down and a mere 24 yards total offense in the first half; Chicago led 21–0 before the Federals even recorded a second first down. By that time, Landry had hit 15 of his first 17 pass attempts, including a 23-yard touchdown pass to Trumaine Johnson. McQuilken had a horrible debut as the Federals quarterback, and was replaced by back-up Hohensee; Hohensee accounted for the Federals only score, a 19-yard pass to Walker Lee. (The only positive was the attendance of 38,007; unfortunately, this was more than double what the Feds would draw in any of their 17 other games played in Washington.)

The next week went even worse for Washington, as quarterback Hohensee, James, and wide receiver Reggie Smith all were injured. McQuilken could only muster three points of offense, while throwing two more interceptions.

In Week 3, the Federals led the Boston Breakers 16–9 with less than five minutes to go in regulation. However, two bad snaps on special teams led to a 19–16 loss.

Playing at home in Week 4, the Federals finally got a victory. They managed to defeat the Michigan Panthers, one of the better teams in the USFL and the eventual 1983 league champions. The Panthers were led by future NFL quarterback Bobby Hebert, and wide receiver Anthony Carter, one of the fastest players in the league. Federals quarterback Kim McQuilken had one of his better games, completing 24 of 48 passes and throwing for 324 yards. He threw three touchdown passes and gave up only one interception, by Panthers linebacker Robert Pennywell; it led to a game-tying score on a pass from Hebert to Derek Holloway. The game went into overtime, during which Washington won on a 22-yard pass from McQuilken to Joey Walters.

In Week 6, the Federals led the Arizona Wranglers 21–16, only to have a potential game-sealing drive stall on the Wranglers′ 2-yard-line. The Wranglers&#x27; first play from scrimmage after that was a 98-yard touchdown pass – the longest in USFL history.

The Federals saved their best game for last in the 1983 season, playing at home against the Philadelphia Stars. The Stars, who entered the game with a record of 15–2, were a dominant team who had crushed Washington 34–3 earlier in the season. At first, it seemed like it was going to be another blow-out loss for the Federals, who entered the game with a record of 3–14. The Stars, led by all-league quarterback Chuck Fusina, built a 14–0 lead in the first half, but McQuilken hit Stan Rome with a 19-yard touchdown pass to cut Philadelphia&#x27;s lead to 14–6 at halftime. In the second half, Federals rookie linebacker Mike Corvino helped stop two late Stars drives with a sack and an interception. Former New York Giants running back Billy Taylor got in on the scoring for Washington with a six-yard run in the third quarter, and the Federals added two points on the conversation. McQuilken scored his first touchdown as a pro with a one-yard run for the go-ahead score in the fourth quarter. Lane had his best day ever as a professional, catching 17 passes for 170 yards, and the Federals shocked the league by defeating the Stars 21–14.

The Federals finished with a record of 4–14, in last place in the USFL&#x27;s Atlantic Division and tied with the Arizona Wranglers – against whom they finished 1–1–0 for the year – for the worst record in the league. The only USFL all-star on the team was reserve running back Eric Robinson, whose kickoff return for touchdown vs. the Tampa Bay Bandits at RFK Stadium was the only kickoff return for a touchdown in the USFL in 1983.

Despite initial fears at the season&#x27;s start that they had little going for them other than James – who rushed for 823 yards during the season – the Federals were far more competitive in 1983 than their 4–14 record indicated. Eight of their losses were by a touchdown or less. They had a fair amount of offensive talent and skill players with comparatively good depth, and they finished the season third in the league in passing attempts. The Federals had pulled off an upset win over the Atlantic Division champion Philadelphia Stars to complete the season and had defeated both teams – Philadelphia and Michigan – who played in the 1983 USFL championship game. In spite of a tremendous number of on-field mistakes, the Federals might have been almost a .500 team – and perhaps even a 12–6 team – with just a few lucky breaks. The Federals had started the season 1–13, but they had a strong finish going 3–1 in the last four games, and it appeared that the Federals had finally learned how to turn a close game into a win. The franchise had grounds for optimism as it considered its prospects for its second season in 1984.

The Federals&#x27; marketing efforts were crippled by the Redskins&#x27; Super Bowl victory only 36 days before the Federals′ first game. Washington-area fans largely viewed the Federals with indifference, and the Federals averaged only 13,800 fans per game in 1983 in a 56,000-seat stadium. Revenue from ticket sales amounted to no more than a third of the $2.6 million projected before the season. Even after taking on several investors who had initially tried to get a USFL franchise for Cleveland, the Federals were still starved for capital. Years later, Bernhard said that he had seriously underestimated the expenses associated with pro football.

===1984 season===

Despite losing millions of dollars in 1983, Bernhard was committed to another season in Washington. The Federals had a lot of reasons for optimism in 1984. The 1983 team had played with heart under Jauch, taking better teams down to the wire even at the end of the season. The USFL added six new teams for the 1984 season, and with the league-wide talent pool expected to be diluted by expansion, the 1984 schedule seemed likely to include a number of very winnable games. With McQuilken&#x27;s post-season retirement, the team had an undisputed and seemingly capable starter at quarterback in Hohensee. The Birmingham Stallions&#x27; acquisition of Cliff Stoudt made their 1983 quarterback Reggie Collier available, and the Federals added him for depth in 1984 alongside Hohensee and rookie Lou Pagley. Star running back Craig James had recovered from his 1983 injury and was healthy for 1984. It seemed like the pitfalls that Jauch had fallen into in the first season might be missed this time around. Player familiarity with the system and their teammates and having a proven winner like Jauch as a coach suggested the Federals were bound to deliver better results in 1984.

Unfortunately, the 1984 season unraveled in a hurry. The league scheduled the Federals to open against the expansion Jacksonville Bulls, probably in an effort to help the get the Federals off to a good start with an easy win. Unfortunately, that plan backfired; hours before the game, the Federals hobbled their defense by cutting all three of their starting linebackers, and the Bulls crushed the Federals 53–14. &quot;We played like a group of untrained gerbils,&quot; Bernhard said after the game. In an effort to save face, Bernhard fired Jauch three days after the game and replaced him with his offensive coordinator, former Maryland Terrapins and Dallas Cowboys running back Dick Bielski.

In Week 2 James suffered a season-ending injury. His frequent injuries had disappointed the Federals. For his part, James wanted to play before larger crowds than the Federals could draw. A little over a month into the season, the Federals granted James his release to allow him to sign with the NFL&#x27;s New England Patriots.

Although the defense was awful throughout the season, the offense was respectable in the last 12 games or so. Hohensee played fairly well for a second-year starter and finished the season with a very respectable – by USFL standards – passer rating of 72.2. Halfback Curtis Bledsoe replaced James as the team&#x27;s featured running back, rushing for a respectable 1,080 yards and seven touchdowns in 1984. Wide receiver Joey Walters caught 98 passes for 1,410 yards and seven touchdowns and made &quot;The Sporting News&quot; 1984 USFL All-Star Team, becoming the Federals&#x27; main star.

Despite the successes of Hohensee, Bledsoe, and Walters, Washington opened the season with eight straight losses and suffered humiliating defeats at the hands of all six expansion teams; among their season lowlights were two losses to the expansion Pittsburgh Maulers, who won only three games all season. The Federals finished with a record 3–15, tied with the Maulers for both last place in the USFL&#x27;s Atlantic Division and the worst record in the league.

Fan support dwindled further; the Federals only averaged 7,700 fans per game in 1984, well below 1983&#x27;s disappointing average. The home opener drew almost 26,000 fewer fans than the 1983 opener; it nonetheless was the biggest home crowd of the season. On April 14 the Federals offered free T-shirts to the first 10,000 fans through the turnstiles for a game against the Oklahoma Outlaws, but only 6,075 showed up, and the crowd of 4,432 who came to RFK Stadium to watch the Federals play the Memphis Showboats on May 6 during a day-long rainstorm was the smallest crowd in USFL history at the time.

==Moving the franchise==

In March 1984, with the Federals failing on the field and at the gate for a second straight season, Bernhard decided to sell the franchise. Florida real estate developer Sherwood &quot;Woody&quot; Weiser agreed in principle to buy the Federals for $5.5 million and made plans to relocate the team to Miami as The Spirit of Miami for the 1985 season. In anticipation of the deal, the USFL executed a lease agreement for the Spirit to play at the Miami Orange Bowl. At a meeting on May 9, 1984, the USFL&#x27;s team owners unanimously approved the sale of the Federals to Weiser.

Weiser signed up University of Miami head coach Howard Schnellenberger as part-owner, president, general manager, and head coach for the 1985 season. Schnellenberger was to assume his new posts as soon as the 1984 USFL season ended. Weiser envisioned closing the deal to purchase the Federals soon after the end of the 1984 USFL season, with Schnellenberger in the interim hiring assistant coaches and joining them in evaluating player talent on the Federals and elsewhere in the USFL and preparing a plan of action for the team after Weiser concluded the purchase. USFL owners openly discussed their expectation that a USFL championship game would take place at the Orange Bowl in the near future.

In June 1984, Bernhard&#x27;s Washington Football Partners entered into a preliminary agreement to sell the Federals to American Sports, Ltd., a company controlled by Weiser. However, by this time there were persistent rumors that the USFL was considering moving to a fall schedule in 1986. Knowing that he could not even begin to compete with the NFL&#x27;s Miami Dolphins for Miami&#x27;s professional football market in the fall, Weiser insisted on writing an escape clause into the purchase agreement that allowed him to cancel the sale if the USFL switched to a fall schedule. On August 22, 1984, the USFL team owners voted to move to a fall schedule in 1986. Weiser promptly canceled the deal to purchase the Federals, and American Sports, Ltd., relinquished the franchise to Washington Football Partners two days later.

This left Bernhard in a desperate situation. Even without the impossible task of competing with the Redskins once the USFL moved to the fall, he had no intention of sticking it out for 1985 even if the USFL had stuck with playing in the spring. Years later, he said Washington fans had very little tolerance for losers, and had spoiled by the Redskins&#x27; resurgence in the 1970s and early 1980s.

Shortly thereafter, hospital magnate Donald Dizney, who had been a minority owner of the Tampa Bay Bandits before briefly joining Weiser&#x27;s group, stepped in to end Bernhard&#x27;s suffering. Dizney quickly reached a deal on the same terms that Bernhard had reached with Weiser. In a deal agreed to on August 28, 1984, and announced on September 1, 1984, Dizney bought the Federals, moved them to Orlando, Florida, and renamed them the Orlando Renegades.

Orlando Football Partners, Inc., was incorporated in Florida on September 10, 1984, as the general partnership which owned the Orlando Renegades. On December 31, 1984, Orlando Football Partners, Ltd., was organized as a limited partnership to hold the franchise, with Orlando Football Partners, Inc., as the general partner.

The Renegades played at the Florida Citrus Bowl. Orlando lay within the territory of the Bandits, which drew many fans from the Orlando area. Rather than resist the franchise&#x27;s move to Orlando, however, Bandits owner John F. Bassett embraced it. Although Bassett had claimed nearly all of Florida south of the Jacksonville area as his home territory, he readily surrendered those rights when the Federals initially made plans to move to Miami, and did the same when they ultimately moved to Orlando.

Unlike Schnellenberger and Weiser of the stillborn Miami franchise, Dizney did not have the benefit of several months of research of coaching and player possibilities. With Schnellenberger opting not to follow the team to Orlando, Dizney turned to Lee Corso, a Florida State University alumnus and a longtime college head coach best known for his tenure at Indiana. Corso had a clear plan that involved building the team around third-year quarterback Reggie Collier. After starting out looking much like the 1984 Federals, opening the season with six straight losses, the Renegades were fairly competitive in their remaining 12 games, winning five of them as the mobile and talented Collier, who had been an abysmal failure in Birmingham and Washington in his first two seasons, began to develop. (Collier later went on to play briefly for the Dallas Cowboys in the NFL). Backup quarterbacks Jerry Golstyen and Steve Pisarkiewicz also played. The team&#x27;s offense also featured running back Curtis Bledsoe and wide receiver Joey Walters. The Renegades finished with a record of 5–13 and a seventh-place finish.

The Renegades drew far better than the Federals, averaging about 25,000 fans per game over their nine regular-season home dates, and the crowd of 26,847 that attended the June 1 game against Tampa Bay, which included many Bandits fans who traveled to Orlando from the Tampa area for the game as part of a growing Tampa Bay-Orlando rivalry, was a highlight of the season. Dizney had hoped to draw more Orlando-area fans away from the Bandits than the Renegades did in 1985 and for bigger crowds overall at Renegades home games. He nonetheless decided to move forward with the team in Orlando for the 1986 USFL season. One of his limited partners, Charles Givens, told NPR that he knew that the Renegades would not be included in any potential merger with the NFL, and contented himself with the likelihood that the Renegades and any other teams left out of a merger would automatically receive $14 million.

After the conclusion of the 1985 season, the USFL considered contraction of the league to focus on its more successful franchises. At a meeting on July 2, 1985, league owners discussed a possible merger of the league&#x27;s three Florida teams. Dizney rejected the idea of the Renegades being involved in any merger, fearing he would lose credibility in Orlando if he agreed to move the Renegades out of the Orlando area. Ultimately, the Renegades were one of eight teams selected to continue operations in the 1986 season, when the USFL planned to switch to a fall schedule. However, the entire league collapsed before any games were played in 1986. Orlando Football Partners, Ltd., was dissolved on January 25, 1988, and the franchise&#x27;s existence as a corporate entity came to an official end when Orlando Football Partners, Inc., was dissolved on September 26, 1997.

<text>The Chicago Blitz was a professional American football team that played in the United States Football League (USFL) in the mid-1980s. They played at Soldier Field in Chicago, Illinois.

== Team history ==

The Blitz were one of the twelve charter franchises of the USFL. The owner was originally slated to be J. Walter Duncan, an Oklahoma oil magnate who had grown up in Chicago. However, league founder David Dixon persuaded Duncan to take on ownership of the New York City franchise–which became the New Jersey Generals–after its original owner, Donald Trump, pulled out.

With Duncan&#x27;s withdrawal, legendary NFL coach George Allen and Southern California developer Willard Vernon Harris, Jr. applied for the vacant Chicago franchise. A search for capital led them to renowned heart surgeon Dr. Ted Diethrich, who had originally expressed interest in a franchise for his hometown of Phoenix. Allen and Diethrich had been friends since the 1970s, when Diethrich gave a talk on heart disease to Allen&#x27;s Washington Redskins. However, he agreed to join Allen and Harris&#x27; group in return for controlling interest. Diethrich served as president, with Harris as executive vice president and Allen as chairman of the board and head coach.

===George Allen===
Allen had been out of coaching since 1977; he had been a candidate for the vacant head coaching position with the Chicago Bears a year earlier; he&#x27;d made his mark in the NFL a quarter-century earlier as the Bears&#x27; de facto defensive coordinator. However, Bears owner George Halas had never forgiven Allen for defecting to the Los Angeles Rams in 1965. The feeling was mutual; Allen relished the chance to get the better of the rival Bears. Allen immediately became the &quot;face&quot; of the new team, and set about putting together the best 40-man roster he could find. The result was a team loaded with NFL veterans that was the early favorite to be the new league&#x27;s first champion.

===1983 season===
The Blitz finished in a tie for the Central Division title with the Michigan Panthers. However, the Panthers were awarded the division title after sweeping the Blitz in the regular season, and would go on to become the league&#x27;s first champions.

In the playoffs, the Blitz blew a 21-point lead over the Philadelphia Stars, losing 44–38 in overtime.

====Struggling at the gate====
The Blitz was one of the strongest teams in the league. Indeed, some suggested that the Blitz and the two finalists, the Stars and Panthers, could have been competitive in the NFL. However, they struggled at the gate, averaging only 18,100 fans—a total that looked even smaller in the relatively spacious configuration of Soldier Field. These numbers were very similar to the gates for the Stars and Panthers in their first year. Both of those franchises would see dramatically higher attendance numbers in their second season based on their on-field success in their first year.

Diethrich lost millions of dollars in 1983. Although he, like most of the other owners, knew that he could expect years of losses until the USFL established itself, he soon tired of flying between his home in Phoenix (he was the founder of the Arizona Heart Institute) and Chicago. Indeed, he had actually sought a team in Phoenix when the USFL initially took shape, but backed out when he could not hammer out a stadium deal. Years later, he said that spending three days a week in Chicago or wherever the Blitz were playing made it difficult to continue his heart research, and led him to conclude he could not be an absentee owner in the long run.

====Franchise swap with Arizona Wranglers====
As it turned out, Arizona Wranglers owner Jim Joseph had lost almost as much money as Diethrich, and was looking to sell the Wranglers. Diethrich was willing to take over in Arizona if he could bring Allen and his NFL veteran-loaded roster with him. Joseph readily agreed. Soon afterward, Diethrich found a buyer for the Blitz in Milwaukee-based heart surgeon James Hoffman.

This resulted in one of the most unusual transactions in sports history. On September 20, 1983, Diethrich sold the Blitz to Hoffman for $7.2 million, then bought the Wranglers from Joseph. Hoffman and Diethrich then engineered a swap of assets in which Allen, the Blitz coaching staff and most of the Blitz players moved to Phoenix while most of the Wranglers roster moved to Chicago. Over 100 total players changed hands. The most notable exception was that Wrangler quarterback Alan Risher stayed in Arizona to back up Greg Landry.

Diethrich initially wanted to take the Blitz name with him to Arizona, but Hoffman insisted on keeping the Blitz name in Chicago. However, little else was left. As soon as the deal closed, Allen sent virtually everything of value at Blitz headquarters in Des Plaines to Phoenix, including typewriters and mirrors. Nearly everything with a Blitz logo or even the team name was thrown into the dumpster. Allen also sent some $100,000 worth of equipment that should have stayed in Chicago as part of the purchase, but Diethrich promised it would be returned.

The deal transformed the Wranglers from a cellar-dweller to a powerhouse almost overnight, while turning the Blitz from the third-best team in the league into a lesser version of a team that finished 4–14, tied for the worst record in the league. However, Hoffman claimed that he would not have even considered buying the team had he been required to keep the expensive player contracts. Nonetheless, the transaction raised serious questions about the USFL&#x27;s credibility—especially in Chicago.

The USFL considered the 1983 and 1984 Wranglers to be the same franchise, even though almost all the players were different.

===The Hoffman Era===
Hoffman spent heavily in promoting the new Blitz. He hired NFL veteran, future Pro Football Hall of Famer and Chicago native Marv Levy as coach: Levy reportedly thought he would be taking over George Allen&#x27;s team when he took the job.

Bears backup QB Vince Evans was brought in to be the new Blitz starting quarterback. Evans signed in November 1983 to a 4-year, $5 million deal in spite of owning a rather unimpressive 57.31 QB rating in seven previous NFL seasons. Evans&#x27; accuracy was always an issue in the NFL. His most accurate season up to that point was 1980 when he completed 53.2% of his passes. He entered the USFL with a career NFL competition percentage of 48.7% and a 31-53 TD to INT ratio.

In January 1984, the Blitz tendered an offer that would have been the largest contract in football, $2 million a year for 3 years, to Bears star running back Walter Payton. Payton promised to consider the offer, but would not be rushed. The Blitz 1984 season was scheduled to start on February 27 and the new ownership had little success selling season tickets. As the Blitz needed Payton quickly to help sales, so they put a deadline on the offer of February 9. In the event, before Payton made his decision, the Blitz withdrew the offer realizing they simply did not have the finances.

After this failure, Hoffman aggressively marketed the Blitz, pouring much money into advertising. It was to no avail; with a less talented team and no big names to attract fans, ticket sales flatlined. Fans were unhappy that Hoffman had jettisoned the core of a near NFL-quality team in favor of an also-ran.

At the outset, the USFL had made much of the fact that it required potential owners to submit to a detailed due diligence and meet strict capitalization requirements. However, it subsequently emerged that USFL officials had largely dispensed with these procedures after Hoffman made an offer for the Blitz. They had been so desperate to get an apparently solid owner in the nation&#x27;s third-largest market that they never took a close look at Hoffman&#x27;s finances. He only paid $500,000 at signing, with the remainder of the purchase price due in installments.

When Hoffman realized that he had grossly underestimated the cost of running a professional football team, he scrambled to find minority investors, but not before falling behind in paying several bills. After the second preseason game, Hoffman abruptly walked away and nominally left the team in the hands of his minority partners. However, Hoffman&#x27;s now-former partners returned the franchise to the league soon afterward when they could not even begin to secure the financing needed to take the field.

The USFL now had a major problem, as they could not simply shut down the Blitz. Its contract with ABC required the league to have teams in the New York, Los Angeles and Chicago markets, which were home to ABC&#x27;s strongest-performing stations.

The league was forced to take over the franchise, with league personnel director Carl Marasco taking over as team president, and future Hall of Famer Bill Polian becoming player personnel director. Soon after taking control, Marasco fired nearly all of Hoffman&#x27;s front office staff in a cost-cutting move.

===The 1984 season===
Although the 1984 Blitz had many of the same players as the 1983 Wranglers, they were a weaker team due to two reasons.

First, there was an expansion draft and its requirements. All of the initial 12 teams were required to make players available for the six new expansion teams. Secondly, Evans was not a capable replacement for Risher, the league&#x27;s 6th-ranked passer in 1983.

Levy kept the &quot;new&quot; Blitz competitive at first. While they lost their first five games, two came as a result of late field goals and one came in overtime. They managed consecutive wins over Washington and San Antonio, but won only three more times after that, finishing with the third-worst record in the league. The 1983 Wrangler defense gave up a league worst 442 points and the 1984 Blitz were equally as challenged defensively, finishing second to last in the league with 466 points allowed.

Evans was the quarterback many fans expected—a flashy talent with little accuracy or consistency and a penchant for turnovers. For the season, he completed 48.7% of his passes with 14 TDs and 22 INTs for a rating of 58.29. Featured HB Larry Canada was solid, running for 915 yards and 7 TDs and adding 48 catches. WR Marcus Anderson led the team with 50 catches for 940 yards with 5 TDs. All-Pro punter Jeff Gossett led the USFL with a 42.5-yard avg.

Matters were little better off the field. The league only pumped the bare minimum into the team to keep it on the field through the season. With their promotional efforts derailed by the firing of the front office staff the Blitz attracted only 7,500 people per game, the second-lowest average gate in the league. The inability to draw even 10,000 per game would dramatically affect the team&#x27;s bottom line.

===Shutting down===
With four games to go, a press conference was held announcing that the Blitz would be shut down. At the same time, the USFL awarded a new Chicago franchise to Chicago White Sox minority owner Eddie Einhorn. While it was stressed that Einhorn&#x27;s franchise was not the Blitz, Einhorn retained the rights to all Blitz players and coaching staff—strongly implying the team would play in the 1985 season. ABC had no objections to this move, probably due to the USFL&#x27;s anemic ratings in Chicago.

Einhorn was a strong proponent of the USFL&#x27;s planned move to the fall in 1986 (so as not to compete with his own White Sox or their crosstown rivals the Chicago Cubs for fans), and focused his efforts on getting a new television deal for the team. He was only willing to field a team in the USFL&#x27;s final spring lame duck season of 1985 if he could merge with another team and was allowed to select players in an expansion draft. When the league refused to agree to these terms, he opted to sit out the 1985 season. He decided to sit out 1986 as well and concentrate instead on getting a new television deal. It wound up being academic when the USFL suspended operations after only winning three dollars in damages in an antitrust suit against the NFL.

===Players who went on to the National Football League===
The Blitz had a number of players who had played in the National Football League or would go on to play there. Some of them were Vince Evans, Tim Spencer, Trumaine Johnson, Greg Landry, Jeff Gossett, Vagas Ferguson, Richard Holland, Joe Ehrmann, Tim Wrightman, Larry Canada, Tom Thayer, Frank Minnifield, Jim Fahnhorst, Marc May, Brian Glasgow, Walter Easley, Luther Bradley, Troy Thomas, Robert Cobb, Ed Smith, Stan White, Eddie Brown, Kevin Long, and Mark Keel.

There are currently two coaches in the Pro Football Hall of Fame that coached in the USFL, both whom coached the Blitz: George Allen (1983) and Marv Levy (1984).

<text>Francisco Largo Caballero (15 October 1869 – 23 March 1946) was a Spanish politician and trade unionist who served as the prime minister of the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War. He was one of the historic leaders of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) and of the Workers&#x27; General Union (UGT). Although he entered politics as a moderate leftist, after the 1933 general election in which the conservative CEDA party won the majority, he took a more radical turn and began to advocate for a socialist revolution, materialized with the failed Revolution of 1934 in Asturias.

After the victory of the Popular Front in the 1936 Spanish general election and following the July coup, Caballero served as prime Minister of Spain during the Spanish Civil War from 4 September 1936 until 17 May 1937. Exiled in France following the republican defeat in 1939, Caballero was imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp after the Nazi invasion of France.

== Early life ==
Born in Madrid, as a young man he made his living stuccoing walls. He participated in a construction workers strike in 1890 and joined the PSOE in 1894. Upon the death in 1925 of party founder Pablo Iglesias, Largo Caballero became head of the party and of the UGT.

== Political career ==
Moderate in his positions at the beginning of his political life, he advocated maintaining a degree of UGT cooperation with the dictatorial government of General Miguel Primo de Rivera, which permitted the union to continue functioning under his military dictatorship (which lasted from 1923 to 1930). This cooperation was the start of Largo Caballero&#x27;s political conflict with Indalecio Prieto, who opposed all collaboration with Primo de Rivera.

Largo Caballero was Minister of Labor Relations between 1931 and 1933 in the first governments of the Second Spanish Republic, headed by Niceto Alcalá-Zamora, and in that of his successor Manuel Azaña. Caballero attempted to improve the conditions of landless labourers (&quot;braceros&quot;) in the rural south. On 28 April 1931 he introduced a decree of municipal boundaries to prevent the importation of foreign labour while there remained unemployed workers within the municipality. In May he established mixed juries (&quot;jurados mixtos&quot;) to arbitrate in agrarian labour disputes, and introduced an eight-hour working day in the countryside. Alongside these, a decree on obligatory cultivation prevented owners from using their land however they wanted. He enjoyed great popularity among the masses of workers, who saw their own austere existences reflected in his way of life.

In the elections of 19 November 1933, the right-wing Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) won power in Spain. The government nominally led by the centrist Radical Alejandro Lerroux was dependent on CEDA&#x27;s parliamentary support. Responding to this reversal of fortune, Largo abandoned his moderate positions and became more openly far left. In the January 3, 1934 edition of &quot;El Socialista&quot;, the PSOE newspaper, he wrote &quot;Harmony? No! Class war! Hatred for the criminal bourgeoise to the death!&quot; A few weeks later, the PSOE compiled a new platform that called for the nationalization of all land, dissolution of all religious orders and the confiscation of their property, and the dissolution of the army, to be replaced by socialist militias. In early October 1934, after three CEDA ministers entered the government, he was one of the leaders of the failed armed rising of workers (mainly in Asturias) which was forcefully put down by the CEDA-dominated government.

He defended the pact of alliance with the other workers&#x27; political parties and trade unions, such as the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and the anarchist trade union, the Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). Once again, this placed him at odds with Prieto. He declared, that he, Largo Caballero &quot;shall be the second Lenin&quot;, whose aim is the union of Iberian Soviet republics.
After the Popular Front won the elections in February 1936, president Manuel Azaña proposed that Prieto join the government, but Largo blocked these attempts at collaboration between PSOE and the Republican government. Largo dismissed fears of a military coup, and predicted that, were it to happen, a general strike would defeat it, opening the door to the workers&#x27; revolution.

In the event, the coup attempt by the colonial army and the right came on 17 July 1936. While not immediately successful, further actions by rebellious army units sparked the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), in which the republic was ultimately defeated and destroyed.

=== Prime Minister of Spain ===
A few months into the civil war, after the Republican Left Party government of José Giral resigned on 4 September 1936, President Manuel Azaña asked Largo Caballero to form a new government.
There resulted a broader-based Popular Front cabinet.
Largo Cabellero served as Prime Minister
and also took the post of Minister of War. Besides conducting the war, he also focused on maintaining military discipline and government authority within the Republic. On 4 November 1936 Largo Caballero persuaded the anarchist &quot;Confederación Nacional del Trabajo&quot; (CNT; &quot;National Confederation of Labour&quot;) to join the government, with four members assigned to junior ministries including Justice, Health and Trade. The decision was controversial with the CNT members.

The Barcelona May Days of 3 to 8 May 1937 led to a governmental crisis that forced Caballero to resign on 17 May 1937. Juan Negrín, also a member of the PSOE, was appointed prime minister in his stead.

Largo Cabellero&#x27;s cabinet, formed on 4 September 1936 and reshuffled on 4 November 1936, consisted of:
=== Exile, death, and legacy ===
Upon the defeat of the Republic in 1939, he fled to France. Arrested during the German occupation of France, he spent most of World War II imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg concentration camp, until the liberation of the camps at the end of the war.

He died in exile in Paris in 1946; his remains were returned to Madrid in 1978 after Franco&#x27;s death in 1975.

<text>The Arizona Wranglers were a professional American football team in the United States Football League (USFL) that existed from late 1982 to mid-1985. They played at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona.

==History==

===Founding===
The team that would eventually become the Arizona Wranglers was originally supposed to be the USFL&#x27;s Los Angeles franchise. The team&#x27;s planned original owner, Alex Spanos, pulled out of his USFL commitment and instead bought a minority stake in the NFL&#x27;s San Diego Chargers.

The owners of the Oakland Invaders, Bay Area real estate executives Jim Joseph and Tad Taube, flipped a coin to decide who would take action to become the new owner of the USFL&#x27;s Los Angeles franchise. Joseph won the flip and got the USFL rights to Los Angeles, selling his stake in the Invaders to Taube.

A few months later, fate shuffled the deck. The owners of the USFL&#x27;s San Diego franchise, cable television pioneers Bill Daniels and Alan Harmon, could not secure access to Jack Murphy Stadium. (Due to pressure from the Chargers, the USFL would never be able to successfully negotiate a lease to Jack Murphy Stadium, a situation that would force a second USFL team, the Outlaws, to leave San Diego before playing a down.)

USFL officials felt that Daniels and Harmon&#x27;s ties to the cable industry would be better suited for the country&#x27;s second-largest market; David Dixon&#x27;s blueprint depended on heavy television exposure. The league forced Joseph to surrender rights to Los Angeles to Daniels and Harmon, whose franchise became the Los Angeles Express. Joseph finally settled on a move to Phoenix, bringing professional football to the city for the first time.

===1983 season===

Joseph appeared to hold fast to the USFL&#x27;s original blueprint. He aggressively marketed the team in Arizona while keeping a tight rein on spending (including player salaries). The results were a mixed bag. The roster was a young team with some talent at the skill positions, but fewer quality starters in the starting lineup and less depth of talent than their opponents. Due to a weaker product, the ticket sales were only in line with most other teams in the league.

The Wranglers were quite competitive at first, posting a 4–4 record and moving into a four-way tie for first in their division. However, they lost their last 10 games—tied for the longest losing streak in league history—finishing in a tie for the worst record in the league.

The 1983 Wranglers featured some talent on offense including the League&#x27;s 6th ranked passer in rookie QB Alan Risher, 12th ranked rusher in 3rd year vet Leon Calvin Murray, and the league&#x27;s #7, #10, #11 receivers (1983 rookies TE Mark Keel, WR Jackie Flowers, and WR Neil Balholm, respectively).

Their defense was not as strong, although it looked fairly strong on paper before the season. The Wranglers signed San Francisco 49er ILB Jeff McIntyre and ILB Glen Perkins from the University of Arizona. But during the pre-season McIntyre, who had a personal services contract with Joseph, asked to be traded because of contract issues. Perkins suffered a knee injury that slowed his play and development.

The Wranglers probably benefited early on from the league&#x27;s decision not to have a preseason. When the rest of their opponents reached mid-season form, the undermanned Wrangler defense appeared to have trouble keeping the games within reach of the offense. The Wranglers gave up 442 points, easily the most in the league. The Wranglers only scored more than 23 points once all season—in their week 2 upset of George Allen&#x27;s Chicago Blitz.

In hopes of avoiding Arizona&#x27;s often-oppressive summer heat, the league scheduled 6 Wranglers home games in the first half of the season. The team only played 3 of their last 9 games at home.

====1983 Schedule====

===1983 USFL Draft===


===Transaction with the Chicago Blitz===
Joseph lost millions of dollars in the 1983 season. Like most of the other owners, he had bought into the league knowing to expect years of losses. However, he was disappointed in the team&#x27;s attendance and unwilling to stick it out in Arizona.

In a stroke of luck for Joseph, Chicago Blitz owner Dr. Ted Diethrich (a Phoenix resident and founder of the Arizona Heart Institute) wanted a chance to move closer to his business interests in the Phoenix area. Despite fielding a team that had come up one game short of the USFL title game, the Blitz&#x27; attendance had been lackluster at best. Diethrich had lost millions of dollars, and did not believe those losses justified an investment that far from home.

Diethrich thought he had a solution to both his and Joseph&#x27;s problems—an unprecedented swap of franchises. Diethrich sold the Blitz to fellow surgeon James Hoffman, then bought the Wranglers from Joseph. Allen, who had been chairman and head coach of the Blitz, took the same posts in Arizona. and his entire coaching staff moved to Phoenix as well. Hoffman and Diethrich then engineered a swap of assets in which most of the Blitz players moved to Phoenix while most of the Wranglers roster moved to Chicago. (The most notable exception was that Wrangler quarterback Alan Risher stayed in Arizona to back up former Blitz quarterback Greg Landry). The deal allowed Allen to keep virtually all of the NFL veteran-loaded roster that he had painstakingly assembled for the Blitz in 1983. It also allowed Diethrich to get a team in his hometown; he had originally sought a USFL franchise for Phoenix in 1983, only to buy controlling interest in the (original) Blitz after being unable to get a lease for Sun Devil Stadium

Diethrich wanted to take the Blitz name with him to Arizona, but Hoffman rebuffed him. As a result, Diethrich rebranded his team as the &quot;New&quot; Arizona Wranglers. While the USFL was active, the league considered the 1983 and 1984 Wranglers to be the same franchise, even though almost all the players were different.

The deal transformed the Wranglers from a cellar-dweller to a league powerhouse almost overnight. However, trading a team that had been, at worst, the third-best team in the league for a lesser version of one of the worst teams in the league raised questions about the USFL&#x27;s credibility—especially in Chicago. The Blitz would never recover, and would be effectively euthanized at the end of the season (Eddie Einhorn was awarded a replacement Chicago franchise, but it never played a down).

===1984 season===
The 1984 Wranglers finished in a tie for first in the Western Division. In the playoffs, they upset the powerful Houston Gamblers, then defeated the Los Angeles Express for the conference title. Although the Express had a better record, the game was played at Sun Devil Stadium because the Express&#x27; home field, Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, was being readied for the 1984 Summer Olympics. To accommodate the oppressive summer heat in the state, as well as the ABC Sports television schedule, the game kicked off at 8:30 p.m. local time (11:30 p.m. Eastern time).

The Wranglers&#x27; run ended in the championship game with a 23–3 defeat by the Philadelphia Stars in what would be Allen&#x27;s last game as a professional coach. Quarterback Greg Landry retired after the season. Allen retired as coach in September 1984, but remain involved with the team. Allen named assistant coach Paul Lanham as head coach. 

The Wranglers intended to change to red jerseys for the 1984 season, but the league office had put in a rule that stated any team changing jersey colors (in this case, blue to red) had to wait one season before doing so.

===1984 Arizona Wranglers Roster===


===Merger with the Oklahoma Outlaws===
Despite making it to the championship game, Diethrich was bleeding in red ink. He expected his all-star team&#x27;s attendance to be much greater than the 25,776 fans per game the no-name Wranglers averaged in 1983. However, as had been the case a year earlier, Phoenix-area fans viewed the Wranglers mostly with indifference. Despite fielding a winning team, the Wranglers&#x27; 1984 attendance figures (25,568 fans per game) were lower than the 1983 numbers, as fans were slow to warm to the new players. It did not help matters that Hoffman had walked away from the Blitz during the preseason and had stopped payment on the installment plan he had brokered with Diethrich.

After losing millions for the second year in a row and realizing that he would never see the remainder of the $7.2 million that Hoffman had promised to pay him for the Blitz, Diethrich decided to get out. He found a willing buyer in Oklahoma Outlaws owner William Tatham, who was looking for a larger market with an acceptable stadium. The two men reached a deal in which the two teams would be merged as the Arizona Outlaws. The Outlaws would be the nominal survivor; the Tathams would own a 75 percent controlling interest with Diethrich retaining 25 percent. However, ex-Wranglers were to make up a majority of the offseason roster. When Diethrich suggested that the merged team might have to file for bankruptcy, the merger fell apart, and Diethrich decided to get out of the league altogether. As a result, the deal was restructured so that the Wranglers folded and the Outlaws took their place in Phoenix. However, since Tatham acquired all the Wranglers&#x27; player contracts–including almost all of the 1984 Wranglers defense–the deal was still widely reported as a merger.

<text>The Arizona Outlaws were a professional American football team that played in the United States Football League in the mid-1980s. They were owned by Fresno banker and real estate magnate William Tatham Sr., who had briefly owned the Portland Thunder of the World Football League.

During their first season, the team played as the Oklahoma Outlaws. They became the Arizona Outlaws for their second season.

== History ==

=== 1984 Oklahoma Outlaws ===

The Outlaws were originally slated to play in San Diego. However, under pressure from baseball&#x27;s Padres, the NFL&#x27;s Chargers and the NASL&#x27;s Sockers, the city refused to grant Tatham a lease for Jack Murphy Stadium. Scrambling for a home, Tatham seriously considered playing in Honolulu for its inaugural 1984 season. However, he settled on Tulsa, Oklahoma—even though the city had not even been included in a list of possible expansion sites for the USFL.

Tatham was initially skeptical about basing a team in Tulsa. It was only the 60th-largest television market, which would have made it by far the smallest market in the league. Moreover, the only viable facility, the University of Tulsa&#x27;s Skelly Stadium, needed major renovations in order to bring it to something approaching professional standards.

However, Tatham had roots in Oklahoma, and eventually concluded that putting his team there would give something back to the state. He christened his team the Oklahoma Outlaws. The club was the second major-league sports team to play in the state, after the North American Soccer League&#x27;s Tulsa Roughnecks.

On July 7, 1983, at the same time the USFL announced the expansion team, Tatham introduced Hall of Fame member Sid Gillman, who came out of retirement at age 71 to serve as the Director of Operations. Gillman signed a roster of players, but was fired by Tatham in December in a dispute over finances.

In what proved to be a harbinger of things to come, Tatham and his son, Bill Jr.–who was tapped as general manager despite being fresh out of law school–discovered soon after the ink dried on his lease with TU that school officials had vastly inflated attendance figures for Tulsa Golden Hurricane football games in hopes of maintaining their Division I-A status. The Tathams had been led to believe that the Hurricane drew 35,000–40,000 people per game, which would have been more than respectable by USFL standards. However, business manager Bill Wall, TU&#x27;s former athletic director, told them after the season opener that the Hurricane actually drew 17,000 per game.

Fortunately for the Tathams, they had a lifeline in Gillman&#x27;s highest-profile signing, former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Doug Williams, who bolted to the upstart league when the Bucs rejected his offer for a significant pay raise out of hand. Years later, Williams said that he was won over when the Tathams &quot;treated me like a human,&quot; rather than &quot;a piece of cattle in a stockyard.&quot; They signed him to a $3 million contract, along with a $1 million signing bonus, which made him easily one of the highest-paid players in either league. By comparison, while with the Bucs, he made less than several backups, and their offer for 1984 would have still made him one of the lowest-paid starters in the league. Williams was not a very refined, efficient, or consistent passer at that point in addition to being a little rusty, but had a big arm and a knack for making plays.

Along with Williams, the Outlaws roster included rookie Oklahoma State star RB Ernest Anderson. Former Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator Woody Widenhofer coached the team. A young out-of-work oil worker, defensive end and part-time musician named Toby Covel played during the Outlaws&#x27; preseason but failed to make the team and played that season with the Oklahoma City Drillers, an unofficial farm team; under his middle name Toby Keith, he eventually emerged as a major country music star.

The team only drew 15,937 to their first game, a home opener versus the expansion Pittsburgh Maulers on a rainy and cold spring day. (Home openers in the USFL for most teams were the highest attendance games of the season.) Two weeks into the season, Bill Jr. announced that Skelly Stadium was inadequate for the Outlaws&#x27; needs and that they would be playing elsewhere in 1985.

The Outlaws were competitive for much of the first half of the season, starting out 6–2 off the strength of Williams&#x27; arm. Unfortunately, the team could not consistently run the ball. (The Outlaws finished with a league worst total of 1537 total rushing yards --- almost 200 yards less than the 17th ranked team.) Two blowout losses sent the team into a downward spiral. They did not win another game that season, dropping 10 straight to finish 6–12.

In spite of those factors, the Outlaws averaged 21,038 fans (in a 40,000-seat stadium), 14th in the league. It might have been even higher if not for brutally cold and wet early-season weather and what amounted to season-long lame duck status. While Tulsa as a USFL host city had a number of legitimate problems, fan turnout was surprisingly respectable, especially compared to the unsustainable attendance numbers seen by USFL teams in Chicago (7,455), Washington (7,694) and Los Angeles (15,361). They were also one of eight teams whose average attendance was 45 percent or more of listed capacity. The Outlaws would draw decent crowds of 25,403, 21,625, 22,017 and 29,324 later in the season.

During the team&#x27;s season in Tulsa, all six of their wins came during inclement weather, 4 at home. Wins against Pittsburgh, Michigan, Houston, at Washington, and San Antonio came in rainy conditions, and a win against Chicago came in a Chicago snow storm.

=== Leaving Oklahoma ===
The Tathams were not exaggerating about Skelly Stadium&#x27;s inadequacy as a professional venue. There was virtually no parking around the stadium, which would have held down attendance even without the weather problems. With no other facility in the Tulsa area suitable even for temporary use, they started searching for a new home. They initially planned to move to the University of Oklahoma&#x27;s Owen Field while a new stadium was being built in Oklahoma City. However, when the USFL voted to move to the fall for the 1986 season, OU officials backed out of the deal. Bill Jr. then worked out a deal to play at Honolulu&#x27;s Aloha Stadium, but Bill Sr. vetoed it.

The Tathams nearly had a deal to merge the Outlaws with the Oakland Invaders. However, the deal collapsed at the last minute because Invaders owner Tad Taube was unwilling to give control of the team to the younger Tatham. The Invaders ultimately merged with the Michigan Panthers.

Homeless and looking for options, the Tathams would turn to the 1984 Western Conference Champion Arizona Wranglers. Despite advancing all the way to the USFL title game after essentially trading rosters with the Chicago Blitz, the Wranglers&#x27; 1984 attendance figures—although respectable—were not enough to cover expenses. In fact, they were actually slightly below those of the 1983 Wranglers team. Owner Dr. Ted Diethrich, who had swapped the Blitz for the Wranglers in the 1983–84 offseason, had anticipated much higher attendance after bringing most of a team reckoned as an NFL-caliber unit to Phoenix. Additionally, he never was paid in full for selling the Chicago franchise rights after the new Blitz owner, James Hoffman, saw his finances collapse. After losing millions for the second year in a row, Diethrich wanted out.

Ultimately, Diethrich agreed to merge the Wranglers with the Outlaws. The merged team was to be known as the Arizona Outlaws, and would take the Wranglers&#x27; place at Arizona State University&#x27;s Sun Devil Stadium. Initially, the Tathams owned 75 percent of the merged team, with Diethrich retaining 25 percent. However, Diethrich quickly decided to get out altogether. Since the Tathams inherited the Wranglers&#x27; player contracts, the deal was still widely reported as a merger. As a result, Phoenix received what amounted to its third USFL team in as many seasons.

=== Arizona Outlaws ===
Under the terms of the deal with Diethrich, the offseason roster for the new Arizona Outlaws comprised 20 players from the 1984 Wranglers, and 13 from the 1984 Outlaws. The Tathams retained many of the better players off both rosters, but not all of them. With few exceptions, they retained the 1984 Wranglers&#x27; defensive players and coaches, while bringing Williams and most of the 1984 Outlaws offense with them to Arizona. Rather than retaining the majority of the 1984 Western Conference Champion Wranglers and simply replacing retiring Wranglers QB Greg Landry with Williams, for the second year in a row little effort was made to retain players in which Phoenix fans felt a vested interest.

The Tathams did, however, name former Sun Devils coach Frank Kush as head coach. Kush was a hard-nosed, run-oriented coach who had struggled as coach of the NFL&#x27;s Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts, largely because he had little luck handling professional quarterbacks. The Tathams may have been looking to the future by hiring Kush. By this time, they had become strong proponents of moving to the fall, and ultimately forcing a merger with the NFL (in which case their investment would have more than doubled). They knew Kush, who was still very much an icon in the region due to his successful 21-year tenure at ASU, would lend them instant credibility. However, he was a surprising choice to team with Williams.

In part due to Kush&#x27;s reputation as a harsh taskmaster who frequently abused his players physically and emotionally, the players boycotted his press conference announcing his return to Phoenix after a six-year absence. However, Kush appeared to have mellowed considerably when training camp began. He complemented players and coaches and was friendly to the media. Years later, defensive line coach John Teerlinck claimed that Kush told him not to worry too much about winning, since it was very likely that the Outlaws would be one of the surviving teams in any merger with the NFL &quot;and our owners will make a lot of money.&quot; Kush did, however, show flashes of his old heavy-handed self during film sessions, often calling his players unflattering nicknames.

In the instance of mergers, the league ran allocation drafts to send players to other teams. The Tathams allowed several of the better players on the Wranglers to be dispersed. In this way Wrangler star HB Tim Spencer, for example, ended up starting for Memphis in 1985. Other key Wranglers joined Landry in retirement or defected to other leagues (ex. CB Frank Minnifield who left in the 1984 season). Wrangler lead receiver Trumaine Johnson actually held out for the full season.

The 1985 season was very much a replay of 1984, with the Outlaws struggling after a quick start. The team jumped out to a 4–2 start, including a 31–13 pounding of the Herschel Walker and Doug Flutie-led New Jersey Generals. However, they proceeded to drop six in a row, and seven out of eight. They rebounded to win three straight, but did not get enough help to make the playoffs, and finished 8–10. Years later, Bill Jr. recalled that the former Wranglers and former Outlaws found it hard to get along. At one point, he threatened to fire the entire defensive staff unless the sniping ended.

The Outlaws were a much better rushing team in 1985 totalling 2019 yards in support of Williams and the passing game.

As had been the case with both versions of the Wranglers, Phoenix-area fans largely viewed the Outlaws with indifference. For the second year in a row, attendance dropped—from the 25,568 George Allen&#x27;s Wranglers&#x27; drew the year before, to 17,881. The crowds looked even smaller than that due to the spacious configuration of Sun Devil Stadium. The Outlaws actually drew 4,000 &quot;fewer&quot; fans than they did in Tulsa, even though Sun Devil Stadium was almost double the size of Skelly Stadium. It did not help matters that the NFL&#x27;s Philadelphia Eagles and St. Louis Cardinals were taking a serious look at moving to Phoenix which had rocketed to major-city status due to its explosive growth in the second half of the 20th century.

At one point, team revenue tailed off to the point that the Outlaws flew commercial flights to games rather than chartered jets. On one of those flights, from Houston back to Phoenix, the simmering tension on the team finally boiled over when Teerlinck got in a fight with offensive tackle Donnie Hickman. It exploded into an all-out brawl, and the plane was met by federal agents when it landed in Phoenix. Teerlinck was fired the next day. Despite this, the Tathams hoped to stick it out once the league won their lawsuit against the NFL.

The Outlaws were one of eight teams slated to play in 1986. After the Portland Breakers folded while the antitrust trial was still underway, the Outlaws were the only team west of the Mississippi River left in the league. While the league won the suit, it only received a nominal award of a dollar (trebled to $3 under antitrust law). The Outlaws, and the rest of the league, had been counting on the lawsuit money to finance their move to the fall and bail out their unsustainable spending. As the league had essentially staked its future on winning a hefty award in court, it suspended operations never to return.

In a last-ditch desperation move, in January 1987, Tatham met with the Canadian Football League hoping to transfer the Outlaws, along with any other USFL team that was willing and able, to the CFL. Under Tatham&#x27;s proposal, the Outlaws would abide by the CFL&#x27;s Canadian-born player quotas. The CFL&#x27;s owners, who were facing their own financial crisis due to the loss of its television sponsorship, doubted that any commitment by a U.S. team to honor Canadian player quotas would withstand legal challenges. The CFL later stated that unless any prospective owner could deliver a television contract of at least $20 million a year (the USFL&#x27;s contract with ESPN was offering $27 million a year for the 1986 season had it been held), it would not consider expanding into the United States. The CFL commissioner ultimately rejected the proposal (along with a similar one from Charles O. Finley), stating: &quot;if any expansion takes place, it will be within the bounds of Canada.&quot;

Soon afterward, the Tathams abandoned any hope of bringing the Outlaws back, and concentrated their efforts on bringing an NFL expansion team to the Phoenix market. Those efforts were abandoned when the St. Louis Cardinals moved into Sun Devil Stadium for the 1988 NFL season.

<text>Pablo Iglesias Posse (17 October 1850 – 9 December 1925) was a Spanish socialist and Marxist labour leader. He is regarded as the father of Spanish socialism, having founded the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) in 1879 and the Spanish General Workers&#x27; Union (UGT) in 1888.

==Biography==
Iglesias was born in Ferrol son to Pedro Iglesias and Juana, humble parents who called him Paulino. He attended school between the ages of six and nine, when his father, a municipal laborer, died. Manuel, his younger brother, and their mother put their possessions in a small covered cart and walked with it to live in Madrid. Pablo&#x27;s mother survived there by begging, and both boys entered the Hospicio of San Fernando. They completed primary schooling there, and Pablo learned printing. Aged twelve he left the Hospicio to work and to help support his mother. He worked as a printer, gradually improving his wages. While he was rendered unemployed by a strike, his brother died of tuberculosis.

He attended evening classes and learned French. This let him read classic works of French political science, translate the works of French socialists and participate successfully in international congresses. Protected by the 1869 Constitution, the Spanish section of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (AIT) organized a series of conferences in Madrid. Iglesias attended, and in 1870, was invited to enter the printers section. The appearance of &quot;Solidarity&quot;, newspaper of the International, started him on the intense journalistic career that occupied the rest of his life.

Iglesias in 1873 applied to join the Association of Art Printers and the following year was chosen as its president. From this platform he began several years of secret work preparing to start the world&#x27;s second workers party. On 22 May 1879, at a renowned clandestine banquet of international brotherhood in Madrid, twenty-five people (led by Iglesias) founded the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE - Partido Socialista Obrero Español).

Political activism repeatedly put Iglesias in jail, first in 1882 after a strike and the last time in 1910 when he was sixty. He always rejected offers of clemency, and as an ex-convict some employers would deny him work. More than once, only the newspaper &quot;The Socialist&quot; he had founded on 12 March 1886, and his wage as its printer, editor and director, kept him from starving.

On 12 August 1888 the Spanish General Workers Union (UGT) was founded in Barcelona, its name proposed by Iglesias.

The Congress of 1889 named him president of its national committee, a position he held for 36 years until his death. In 1890, when the day of struggle was celebrated for the first time in Madrid on 1 May, he headed a demonstration. He led the representation to the Government of demands for legislative reforms, such as the 8-hour working day. In 1905 he first joined the City Council of Madrid.

Republicans had opposed Iglesias, but a Republican-Socialist alliance paved the way for the 1910 elections to make him the first socialist deputy in the Spanish Parliament. Worsening health prevented him attending many parliamentary sessions after 1914, limiting his parliamentary career. 1923 saw him elected a deputy for the last time.

Despite his sparse theoretical background, he produced many excellent intellectual works in Spain and internationally. He published more than two thousand newspaper articles in Spain between his first, &quot;The War&quot;, on 5 December 1870 in &quot;Solidarity&quot;, and the last, &quot;The Working Class Will Win&quot; in &quot;Freedom&quot; on 5 December 1925.

Iglesias was one of the best propagandists among Spanish socialist idealists; few workers&#x27; leaders wrote so much of interest. Characterised by vehement defense and furious attack, his works make an ethically coherent call for regeneration and hope.

On his death, an office drawer contained a parting gift of 1,000 pesetas from Iglesias for &quot;The Socialist&quot;, to which he had been linked from its birth. There were widespread posthumous tributes to him. With Government authorization, more than 150,000 workers accompanied his funeral procession to the civil cemetery in Madrid.

The Spanish liberal philosopher José Ortega y Gasset praised him as a &quot;secular saint&quot;. In &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls,&quot; Ernest Hemingway wrote, &quot;God pity the Spanish people. Any leader they have will muck them. One good man, Pablo Iglesias, in two thousand years...&quot; (Chapt. 35).

<text>The Michigan Panthers were a professional American football team based in Metro Detroit. The Panthers competed in the United States Football League (USFL) as a member of the Western Conference and Central Division. The team played its home games at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan.

Amid financial struggles following the 1984 season, the team was merged with the Oakland Invaders in 1985, where they would operate under the Invaders name.

The Panthers won the inaugural USFL Championship, 24–22 over the Philadelphia Stars.

==Team history==
The Michigan Panthers were named as a charter member of the United States Football League (USFL) on May 11, 1982. A. Alfred Taubman, one of the nation&#x27;s leading real estate developers, headed the ownership group that included Judge Peter B. Spivak and Max M. Fisher.

The Panthers named Jim Spavital, general manager of the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Saskatchewan Roughriders, as their General Manager on August 26, 1982. Michigan then hired Jim Stanley as their Head Coach on November 18, 1982, after George Perles decided to coach at Michigan State. Stanley brought a wealth of coaching experience, with stops at SMU, UTEP, Oklahoma State, Navy, and on the professional level with the CFL&#x27;s Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and NFL&#x27;s New York Giants and Atlanta Falcons, mainly as an assistant coach. Stanley would be the club&#x27;s only head coach. The coaching staff was rounded out by Larry Coyer, Pete Rodriguez, and Dick Roach (Defensive coaches). George Dickson, Bob Leahy, and Kent Stephenson were the offensive coaches.

The Pontiac Silverdome was the home of the Panthers. In the 1980s, most NFL teams did not have complete schedule control over their stadiums, which became common practice in the aftermath of the original USFL, so the Detroit Lions could not have blocked the Panthers (publicly, the Lions avoided discussion of the USFL). C. Bruce Martin, the ideologue behind Godstock, was the first male cheerleader for a professional football team when he cheered for the Michigan Panthers.

The USFL&#x27;s first collegiate draft was held on January 4, 1983. The Panthers selected Wisconsin SS David Greenwood with their first round (10th overall) selection.

They also tabbed Michigan WR Anthony Carter in the USFL Territorial Draft – a process whereby USFL teams could protect up to 25 graduating seniors from a series of local universities. The Panthers had territorial rights to the University of Michigan, Michigan State, Eastern Michigan, Central Michigan and Western Michigan. The Panthers used this draft to select two placekickers. One was Novo Bojovic, and the other was Michigan&#x27;s Ali Haji-Sheikh. Sheikh spurned the Panthers to sign with the New York Giants of the NFL.

Michigan made a splash in signing some of the top young NCAA prospects in 1983 in Michigan WR Anthony Carter, Tulsa RB Ken Lacy, Wisconsin SS David Greenwood and QB Bobby Hebert of Northwestern State (La.). The Panthers also had a few key players with NFL experience. Tackle Ray Pinney and Tyrone McGriff had played for the Super Bowl Pittsburgh Steelers teams. Linebacker John Corker had played three seasons for the Houston Oilers. The Panthers also landed three former Cleveland Browns starters in running back Cleo Miller, defensive back Oliver Davis, and quarterback Mark Miller. The team also had former All-Pro punter Bob Grupp, who had played for the NFL&#x27;s Kansas City Chiefs. However, Grupp had been a one-season wonder in Kansas City, and after a few inconsistent weeks, he was released, and safety David Greenwood did double duty taking over as the team&#x27;s punter. Future Buffalo Bills linebacker and children&#x27;s book author Ray Bentley was also a Michigan Panther.

===1983 season highlights===
Michigan held its first training camp at City Island Stadium in Daytona Beach, Florida, sifting through over 75 players.

On Monday, March 7, 1983; the Panthers opened the season with a 9–7 win over the Birmingham Stallions at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. This was the first professional football game ever broadcast on ESPN. Serbian kicker (via Central Michigan) Novo Bojovic kicked the winning field goal from 48 yards out in the waning moments.

The Panthers then dropped their next four contests, losing on March 12 to the Tampa Bay Bandits (19–7); Mar. 19 at home to the Oakland Invaders (33–27); Mar. 27 at the Washington Federals (22–16 in OT) and April 4 at home to the Denver Gold (29–21). Their slow start was attributed mostly due to a very porous offensive line that struggled to create holes or time for their offensive stars. Management addressed the issue by signing a bevy of experienced offensive linemen in OT Ray Pinney (Pittsburgh Steelers), OG Tyrone McGriff (Pittsburgh Steelers) and OG Thom Dornbrook (NY Giants). Dornbrook and McGriff would both make USFL all-league teams in 1983.

The Panthers had a six-game winning streak. Then, on May 23, they and the Birmingham Stallions were tied 20–20 in the fourth quarter. Michigan would have had the lead, but the extra point attempt was blocked. The game went into overtime and was won by Birmingham thanks to a 46-yard field goal by Stallions kicker Scott Norwood.

The Panthers would bounce back with a 42–7 thrashing of the stellar Tampa Bay Bandits, coached by future Florida Gators head coach Steve Spurrier. The additions on the offensive line, combined with installing rookie Bobby Hebert as quarterback, helped the Panthers win 11 of their next 13 contests to finish with a 12–6 record. They actually tied the Chicago Blitz for the best record in the Central Division, but were awarded the division title after sweeping the Blitz in the regular season.

In the playoffs, the Panthers hosted the Western Division champion Oakland Invaders before a USFL-record crowd of 60,237. The Panthers&#x27; decisive 37–21 victory vaulted them to the inaugural USFL championship game in Denver, Colorado.

On July 17, 1983, the Panthers captured the USFL&#x27;s first championship with a 24–22 win over the Atlantic Division champion Philadelphia Stars. QB Bobby Hebert hit WR Anthony Carter on a 48-yard touchdown strike with 3:11 left in the fourth quarter for what proved to be the deciding score. Hebert was named MVP of the game, throwing for 319 yards and three touchdowns.

The Panthers&#x27; late season surge (counting the playoffs, they went 13–2 to finish the season) was fueled by the addition of NFL-comparable talent at several positions. Indeed, they were one of three USFL teams, along with the Stars and Blitz, that observers believed could have made a good account of themselves in the NFL. It came at a high price, however; they spent $6 million during the season—three times what USFL founder David Dixon recommended that a team spend in a single season.

===1984 season highlights===
The Panthers were expected to roll to another Central Division title in 1984. Due to expansion, they were now in a Central Division with three expansion teams and a Blitz squad that had swapped nearly all of its players with the last place Arizona Wranglers. They initially didn&#x27;t disappoint, sweeping their first six games. However, in the sixth game, a win over the expansion San Antonio Gunslingers, star receiver Anthony Carter broke his arm and was lost for the season. Without their chief offensive weapon the Panthers promptly went into a tailspin, losing eight of their next ten games (the Panthers&#x27; only wins in this stretch both came in overtime) to sink to an 8–8 record. Needing to win their last two games against Oklahoma and Chicago just to make the playoffs, Michigan did just that, finishing 10–8.

The first round playoff game against the Los Angeles Express (in a less-than-tenth-filled Los Angeles Coliseum) turned out to be longest professional football game in history. The Panthers took a 21–13 lead in the fourth quarter, only to have future Hall of Famer Steve Young throw a touchdown pass, then personally score the two-point conversion to tie the game at 21 with 52 seconds remaining. The Panthers had chances to win the game in both the first and second overtimes, but normally reliable kicker Novo Bojovic missed field goals each time. Finally, in the third overtime, rookie Mel Gray (who would later play for the Detroit Lions) ran 24 yards to give LA a 27–21 victory, ending pro football&#x27;s longest day after 93 minutes and 33 seconds of play time. (Gray&#x27;s touchdown would prove to be painful for the young star—the force of the tackle at the end of the play broke his arm.)

It turned out to be the Panthers&#x27; last game. After the 1984 season was over USFL owners, largely under the influence of New Jersey Generals owner Donald Trump and Chicago franchise owner Eddie Einhorn began talking seriously about moving to a fall schedule in 1986. While the Panthers had developed a loyal following, Taubman was a strong believer in the original spring football concept. He also had no desire to compete with the Detroit Lions. Not only was he a decades-long Lions fan, but he was a longtime friend of Lions owner William Clay Ford.

The Panthers had been far more successful on the field than the Lions; at the time of the USFL&#x27;s founding, the Lions had tallied only three winning seasons since the NFL-AFL merger, and had only made the playoffs once in a non-strike year since winning their last league title in 1957. However, Taubman knew that he wouldn&#x27;t have even begun to be able to go head-to-head with the Lions even if he&#x27;d been inclined to do so. According to personnel director Mike Keller, the only colleges within reasonable driving distance of Detroit would not even consider opening their doors to a Panthers team playing in the fall, meaning that they would have had to play home games on Wednesdays or Thursdays. However, Taubman believed the Panthers would not have been able to get a lease for the Silverdome in the fall. Even before then, a study of market conditions concluded that despite having a decent following by USFL standards, the Panthers would have been &quot;better off moving out of the Michigan market&quot; due to exorbitant advertising rates and a fan base with little tolerance for losing.

Taubman felt like the move was a foregone conclusion. As a result, after the merger between the Oakland Invaders and the Oklahoma Outlaws collapsed, Taubman quietly approached Invaders owner Tad Taube about a possible merger with his Panthers. When the league owners met to vote on moving to the fall, Taubman sent his son, Robert, with a message for the commissioner—if the teams voted to move to the fall, the Panthers would merge with the Invaders, with the Invaders as the surviving team. When the vote to play in the fall passed, the Panthers and Invaders announced their merger, with Taubman as majority owner of the Invaders.

===Aftermath===

Bolstered by a number of Panthers players, the Invaders made it all the way to the 1984 USFL Championship Game. They lost to the now-Baltimore Stars in a rematch of sorts of the 1983 title game. 

It would be the last down that the merged team would play. After the USFL received only $3 in its antitrust lawsuit against the NFL, on which it had staked its survival, the league suspended operations and never returned. The league&#x27;s abandonment of the Detroit market was a major factor behind the adverse jury award. Even before the trial, the Invaders suspended operations after Taubman pulled out altogether.

The A-11 Football League (A11FL), a planned spring football league which had intended to start play in 2015, had announced its intention to revive the Michigan Panthers for one of its charter franchises.

On November 22, 2021, a new version of the USFL announced that the Michigan Panthers would be one of eight teams in the league&#x27;s re-launch in the spring of 2022.

<text>The Oakland Invaders were a professional American football team that played in the United States Football League (USFL) from 1983 through 1985. Based in Oakland, California, they played at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum.

The team can trace its history to 1977 when they played in the California Football League as the Twin Cities Cougars, and won four league championships (1979–1982). During that time, they played their home games at the Marysville High School field.

==History==

===In reaction to the Raiders relocating to Los Angeles===
Oakland had been without a football team since the Oakland Raiders relocated to Los Angeles before the 1982 NFL season. The Invaders stepped in to fill the void; the similar name was no accident. One of the Invaders&#x27; first player signings was former Raider and 49er Cedrick Hardman, who came out of a one-year retirement to serve as player-coach.

The team was originally owned by Bay Area real estate magnates Jim Joseph and Tad Taube. However, after the original owner of the USFL&#x27;s Los Angeles franchise, Alex Spanos, bought the San Diego Chargers instead, Joseph and Taube flipped a coin to decide who would buy the Los Angeles rights. Joseph won the toss, selling his stake in the Invaders to Taube. As it turned out, Joseph was forced to move his team to Phoenix, Arizona as the Arizona Wranglers.

===1983 season===
Taube held fast to David Dixon&#x27;s original blueprint for the USFL, heavily marketing the team in the Bay Area while keeping tight controls on spending (including player salaries).

Led by the league&#x27;s 2nd ranked passer QB Fred Besana, WR Gordon Banks, and ex-Raiders HB Arthur Whittington and TE Raymond Chester, the Invaders finished with 9–9 record. However, in an extremely weak Pacific Division, this was enough to garner them the division title. In the playoffs, despite a valiant effort, they were overrun by the eventual league champion Michigan Panthers, 37–21 in front of 60,237 rabid fans in the Pontiac Silverdome (the largest crowd for any USFL game in the 1983 season).

===1984 season===
The Invaders were picked by most to again challenge for a playoff spot in 1984, but their powerful offense fell apart in the first half of the season, scoring only 82 points. The team was unable to run the ball and lost nine straight to open the season. With the emergence of RB Eric Jordan, the Invaders′ running attack rebounded and the team won seven of its last nine games. The defense was strong throughout the season, finishing seventh in points allowed. However, attendance tumbled to 23,644 per game – nearly 8,000 fewer than in 1983.

===1985 season===
As early as 1984, Taube had come to believe the USFL should move to the fall. He began looking for new investors when it became apparent that the USFL was going to vote to switch to fall play in 1986, knowing he would be competing directly with the San Francisco 49ers. However, unlike other USFL teams who would be going head-to-head against NFL teams, Taube had reason for optimism. The Raiders had successfully built their own niche market and fan base in Oakland for two decades, and there was at least a chance the Invaders could have survived in the same manner. He nearly merged his team with the Oklahoma Outlaws. However, talks collapsed when Outlaws owner William Tatham demanded that his son, Bill Jr., be given control over the merged team&#x27;s football operations.

Taube then approached the Michigan Panthers, who had been one of the league&#x27;s strongest teams during its first two years. Some observers reckoned them as an NFL-quality team; indeed, the Panthers had made a better account of themselves on the field than the Detroit Lions. However, Panthers owner A. Alfred Taubman was a strong supporter of spring football, and had no desire to directly compete with the Lions. Knowing that he would not even begin to be able to go head-to-head with the Lions even if he&#x27;d been inclined to do so, he had begun putting out feelers for a merger partner when it became clear that the move to the fall was a foregone conclusion.

Taubman and Taube and quickly reached a deal for a merger. The Invaders would be the surviving team, but Taube sold controlling interest in the merged team to Taubman while remaining chairman of the board. The merger was formally announced after the owners approved moving to the fall.

The new team, bolstered with key players from the Panthers such as Bobby Hebert, went a league-best 13–4–1 in the regular season and advanced all the way to the 1985 USFL championship game. The championship game was a rematch of sorts with Chuck Fusina&#x27;s Stars, who now played in Baltimore; the Panthers had upended the Stars in the league&#x27;s inaugural title game. The Invaders were in the midst of a potential game-winning drive when a personal-foul penalty derailed their momentum, allowing the Stars to defeat Hebert&#x27;s Invaders 28–24, and claim indisputable bragging rights as the league&#x27;s all-time best team.

Despite reaching the championship game, the team&#x27;s attendance fell again, to a barely sustainable 17,509. Soon after the championship game, Taubman decided to pull out. The loss of Taubman&#x27;s wealth left the Invaders without nearly enough resources for the move to the fall, and they suspended operations for the 1986 season. As it turned out, the championship game was the last USFL game ever played, as the league was effectively killed by an antitrust suit against the NFL in which it only won $3 in damages.

<doc id="273226" wikidata="Q586595" url="?curid=273226" title="Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac">
<text>Antoine de la Mothe, sieur de Cadillac (, ; March 5, 1658October 16, 1730), born Antoine Laumet, was a French explorer and adventurer in New France, which stretched from Eastern Canada to Louisiana on the Gulf of Mexico. He rose from a modest beginning in Acadia in 1683 as an explorer, trapper, and a trader of alcohol and furs, achieving various positions of political importance in the colony. He was the commander of Fort de Buade in St. Ignace, Michigan, in 1694. In 1701, he founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit (which became the city of Detroit); he 
was commandant of the fort until 1710. Between 1710 and 1716, he was the governor of Louisiana, although he did not arrive in that territory until 1713.

His knowledge of the coasts of New England and the Great Lakes area was appreciated by Frontenac, governor of New France, and Pontchartrain, Secretary of State for the Navy. This earned him various favors, including the Order of Saint Louis from King Louis XIV. The Jesuits in Canada, however, accused him of perverting the Native Americans with his alcohol trading, and he was imprisoned for a few months in Quebec in 1704, and again in the Bastille on his return to France in 1717.

Upon his arrival in America, La Mothe adopted his title after the town of Cadillac, Gironde in southwestern France. The city of Detroit became the world center of automobile production in the 20th century. William H. Murphy and Henry M. Leland founded the Cadillac auto company and paid homage to him by using his name for their company and his self-created armorial bearings as its logo in 1902. Various places bear his name in America, in particular Cadillac Mountain in Maine and the town of Cadillac, Michigan.

He was widely hailed as a hero until the 1950s and the rise of liberal scholarship, but more recent writers have criticized him. One, W. J. Eccles, claims that &quot;he most definitely was not one of the &#x27;great early heroes&#x27; and probably deserves to be ranked with the &#x27;worst scoundrels ever to set foot in New France&#x27;.&quot;

==Early life==

Cadillac was born Antoine Laumet on March 5, 1658, in the small town of Saint-Nicolas-de-la-Grave in the province of Gascony (today in the Tarn-et-Garonne, Occitanie). His father, Jean Laumet, was born in the village of Caumont-sur-Garonne. He became a lawyer in the Parlement of Toulouse. In 1652 Jean was appointed lieutenant to the judge of Saint-Nicolas-de-la-Grave by Cardinal Mazarin. He was appointed as a judge in 1664. Antoine&#x27;s mother, Jeanne Péchagut, was the daughter of a merchant and landowner. La Mothe&#x27;s adult correspondence reveals that his youth included rigorous study at a Jesuit institution where he learned theology, the law, agriculture, botany and zoology.

In a record of service he filled out in 1675, he said that he had enlisted in the military as a cadet at the age of 17 in the Dampierre regiment, in Charleroi, nowadays Belgium. Two years later in personal letters, however, he reported that he had been an officer in the Clérambault regiment in Thionville, and in 1682 he had joined the Albret regiment, in Thionville.

At the age of 25, Antoine Laumet fled from France for North America. His father lost a lawsuit against a lawyer in Castelsarrasin that caused him financial difficulties. In addition, he had lost financial support following the death of Cardinal Mazarin and suffered the current intolerance against Protestants. Laumet may have immigrated illegally, as historians have not found his name on any passenger list of ships departing from a French port.

==New France==
In 1683, Antoine Laumet arrived at Port Royal, the capital of Acadia. During the next four years, he wandered from New England to New Holland, pushing south to the Caroline, now North Carolina and South Carolina, and while learning some Native American languages and habits. He probably entered into a business relationship with Denis Guyon, a merchant of Quebec. On June 25, 1687, at the age of 29, he married Guyon&#x27;s daughter, Marie-Thérèse, 17, in Quebec.

The marriage certificate is the first document that records his new identity. He identified as &quot;&quot;Antoine de Lamothe, écuyer, sieur de Cadillac&quot;, and signed as &quot;De Lamothe Launay&quot;. Like many immigrants, he took advantage of emigrating to the New World to create a new identity, perhaps to conceal the reasons that drove him from France. This new identity &quot;ne sort pas de son sac&quot;&quot; (&quot;I did not create this identity out of nowhere&quot;), as he wrote later. Antoine Laumet based his new titles on those Sylvestre d&#x27;Esparbes de Lussan de Gout, baron of Lamothe-Bardigues, lord of Cadillac, Launay and Le Moutet; adviser to the Parliament of Toulouse. He knew him for at least two reasons: Bardigues, Cadillac, Launay and Le Moutet are villages and localities close to his birthplace, Saint-Nicolas-de-la-Grave, and Antoine&#x27;s father Jean Laumet was a lawyer in the Parliament of Toulouse.

The sons likely encountered each other during their studies. Second son in his family, Laumet identified with the second son of the baron. He used the phonic similarity between his own name and that of Launay, creating the name: Antoine de Lamothe-Launay. He took the title of &quot;écuyer&quot; (squire), the rank held by a family&#x27;s second son, followed by the title &quot; sieur&quot; (sire) of Cadillac. This accorded with the Gascon custom whereby the junior family member succeeds the elder son upon the latter&#x27;s death. Laumet created a new name, identity and noble origin, while protecting himself from possible recognition by persons who knew him in France.

In addition, he presented his own titles of nobility, as illustrated by armorial bearings that he appropriated, in a slightly altered form, from Sylvestre d&#x27;Esparbes de Lussan, which would later become known as the logo of Cadillac.

The marriage proved to be a fertile one. The Lamothe-Cadillac couple had six daughters and seven sons: Judith (1689), Magdeleine (1690), Marie Anne (1701), ?

In 1688, the governor Jacques-René de Brisay de Denonville gave him the concession of the seigniory (estate) of Les Douacques (which later became the town of Bar Harbor, Maine, well known today as a tourist town, but then for fishing and lobsters). His concession brought him no income, even from agriculture. Lamothe entered into a trading partnership with officers of Port Royal, an activity facilitated by using a ship owned by his brothers-in-law Guyon. In 1689, he was sent on an expedition in the vicinity of Boston. Upon his return, he asked the governor of Acadia, Louis-Alexandre des Friches de Méneval, for a job as notary, to bring in a minimum income; his request was turned down. Then, Cadillac was introduced to the governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac in Quebec, who sent him on an exploratory mission along the coasts of New England, aboard the frigate &quot;L&#x27;Embuscade&quot; (&quot;The Ambush&quot;). Strong head winds forced the ship to return to France.

In 1690, Cadillac was in Paris. He became part of the circle of the Secretary of State for the Navy, the marquis de Seignelay, then of his successor Louis Phélypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain, who appointed him officer of marine troops. On his return to Port Royal, LaMothe learned that the English admiral William Phips had seized the city, and that his wife, daughter, and son were being held captives. They were released in exchange for some English prisoners. In 1691, Cadillac repatriated his family to Quebec, but their ship was attacked by a privateer out of Boston, who took possession of all their goods.

Cadillac was promoted to lieutenant in 1692. He was sent with the cartographer Jean-Baptiste-Louis Franquelin to draw charts of the New England coastline in preparation for a French attack on the English colonies. He set out again for France to hand over the charts, together with a report, to the Secretary of State Pontchartrain. In 1693, he got an allowance of 1500 pounds for his work and was sent back on a further mission to supplement his observations. Frontenac promoted him to captain, then lieutenant commander in 1694.

===Michilimackinac (1694–1696)===
Cadillac was appointed commander of all the stations of the &quot;Pays d&#x27;En-Haut&quot; (the upper countries). He left France at the peak of his career to take up his command of Fort de Buade or &quot;Michilimackinac,&quot; which controlled all fur trading between Missouri, Mississippi, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio valley. Cadillac gave his wife power of attorney to sign contracts and notarize documents in his absence.

In 1695, Cadillac traveled to explore the area of the Great Lakes and to draw up charts. He had the idea of starting a fort in the straits between Lakes Erie and Huron to compete with the English. In Michilimackinac, he came into conflict with the Jesuit fathers, such as Étienne de Carheil, who accused him of supplying alcohol to the Native Americans. This was prohibited by a royal decree.

In 1696, to mitigate the difficulties of fur trading, the king ordered the closing of all trading posts, including Michilimackinac. Cadillac returned to Montreal. In 1697, he was authorized to return to France to present his project of a new fort on the strait to the Secretary of State Pontchartrain; Frontenac requested that he be promoted to lieutenant commander. However, Canadian notables strongly opposed the project which, they believed, would lead to the ruin of Quebec and Montreal. Only in 1699 did Cadillac get the support of Pontchartrain to implant the new fort; this was authorized in 1700 by the king, who entrusted its command to Cadillac.

===Le Détroit (1701–1710)===
On July 24, 1701, Antoine de La Mothe-Cadillac founded Fort Pontchartrain and the parish of Sainte-Anne on the straits (&quot;&quot;le détroit&quot; &quot; in French). He was helped by Alphonse de Tonti. Their wives joined them in October. In 1702, Cadillac went back to Quebec to request the monopoly of all fur-trading activities and the transfer to his authority of the American tribes in the area of the straits. He became a shareholder in the &quot;Company of the Colony.&quot; After return to the straits, he helped in welcoming and settling the native tribes formerly installed at Michillimakinac.

A fire devastated Fort Pontchartrain in 1703. This disaster destroyed all the registers and records. Cadillac was recalled to Quebec in 1704 to face charges of trafficking in alcohol and furs. Although he was imprisoned as a preventive measure for a few months, his name was cleared in 1705. The king guaranteed him all his titles and granted him the fur-trading monopoly he sought. Two years later, Cadillac was charged with multiple counts of abuse of authority; Pontchartrain appointed a representative, Daigremont, to investigate. He formulated an indictment against Cadillac in 1708.

In 1709, the troops stationed on the straits were given the order to return to Montreal. In 1710, the king named Cadillac governor of &quot;La Louisiane&quot;, the expansive Louisiana (New France) territory, and ordered him to take up his duties immediately, traveling via the Mississippi River.

=== Louisiana (1710–1716) ===

Cadillac did not obey. He drew up a general inventory of the straits, and then, in 1711, boarded a ship, with his family, bound for France. In Paris, in 1712, he convinced the Toulouse-born financier Antoine Crozat to invest in Louisiana.

In June 1713, the Cadillac family arrived at Fort Louis, Louisiana (now Mobile, Alabama), after a tiring crossing. In 1714, Crozat recommended the construction of forts along the Mississippi River, whereas Cadillac wished to strengthen defenses at the mouth of the River and to develop trade with nearby Spanish colonies.

In 1715, Cadillac and his son Joseph prospected in the Illinois Country (Upper Louisiana), where they claimed to have discovered a copper mine, although there is no copper ore in that area. They established a farm and founded the settlement of St. Philippe on the east side of the Mississippi River. Cadillac directed the first mining of lead in present-day Missouri at what is now called Mine La Motte on the west side of the river. The French brought in slaves to work at the mine; they were the first people of African descent in the future state of Missouri. The production of lead was important for ammunition in the colonies. The Southeast Missouri Lead District is still a major source of that metal.

After many arguments, Crozat withdrew any authority Cadillac had in the company. The following year, he ordered Cadillac removed from colonial office.

==Castelsarrasin (1717–1730)==
The Cadillac family returned to France and, in 1717, settled in La Rochelle. Cadillac went to Paris with his son Joseph. They were arrested immediately and imprisoned in the Bastille for five months. They were released in 1718, and Cadillac was decorated with the Order of Saint Louis to reward his 30 years of loyal services. He settled in the paternal home, where he dealt with his parents&#x27; estate.

He also made many trips to Paris to have his rights to the concession on the straits recognized. He prolonged his stay in Paris in 1721, giving another general power of attorney to his wife to sign documents in his absence. He was finally vindicated in 1722. He sold his estate on the straits to Jacques Baudry de Lamarche, a Canadian. The French government appointed Cadillac as governor and mayor of Castelsarrasin, close to his birthplace.

Antoine de Lamothe-Cadillac died on October 16, 1730, in Castelsarrasin (Occitanie), &quot;around the midnight hour&quot;, at the age of 72. He was buried in a vault of the Carmelite Fathers&#x27; church.

==Legacy==
Some of Antoine de Lamothe-Cadillac&#x27;s far-reaching visions were developed after he had left New France. For instance, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville founded the city of New Orleans, near the mouth of the Mississippi River, in 1718, and it became a major port and city of New France.
 
The straits became a strategic location. Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit enjoyed an ideal location between the Great Lakes and the river basins. The fort would be succeeded by Fort Detroit and Fort Wayne and by Fort Amherstburg and Fort Malden on the opposite shore.

The car brand Cadillac was named after him, and its headquarters was in Detroit, where Cadillac himself explored.

Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac was honored with a 3-cent stamp on July 24, 1951, to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his landing at Detroit in 1701. The stamp&#x27;s background design depicts Detroit&#x27;s skyline as it appeared in 1951 and the foreground shows Cadillac&#x27;s landing at Detroit in 1701.

A museum in his birthplace opened in 1974, conceived of and funded by historians in Detroit.

On April 20, 2016, the public French high school in Windsor, Ontario, was renamed in Cadillac&#x27;s honour.

During the first decade of the 20th century, a street in the Guybourg area in Longue-Pointe (now Mercier) on the island of Montreal was named in honour of Cadillac. In 1976, Cadillac station on the green line of the Montreal Metro was opened at this street.

<doc id="273228" wikidata="Q156799" url="?curid=273228" title="Felipe González">
<text>Felipe González Márquez (; born 5 March 1942) is a retired Spanish politician who was Prime Minister of Spain from 1982 to 1996 and leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party from 1974 to 1997. He is the longest-serving democratically-elected Prime Minister of Spain.

González joined the PSOE in 1964 when it was banned under the Francoist regime. He obtained a law degree from the University of Seville in 1965. In 1974, the PSOE elected González as its Secretary-General after a split in its 26th Congress. He led the party through the Spanish transition to democracy, carrying it to a strong second-place finish in the 1977 general election, making the PSOE the main opposition to the ruling Union of the Democratic Centre, a position it maintained in 1979.

After the PSOE victory in the 1982 general election, González formed his first majority government, backed by 202 out of the 350 deputies at the Congress of Deputies, and led the government of Spain for thirteen and a half years after three additional victories in the 1986, 1989 and 1993 general elections. In 1996, González lost the election to José María Aznar and the People&#x27;s Party and was elected to the Congress of Deputies for the last time in the 2000 general election, from Seville.

==Early life==
González was born in Bellavista, Seville, the son of a small dairy farmer. He has a sister called Lola González Márquez, married to Francisco Germán Palomino Romera, by whom she has two sons, Felipe and Germán Palomino González. He studied law at Seville University and started his career as attorney specialising in labor law. While at the university he met members of the clandestine socialist trade union Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT). He also contacted members of the PSOE and started taking part in the party&#x27;s clandestine activity, necessary under the dictatorship of Franco. During that time he adopted the alias and moved to Madrid. He was elected Secretary General of the Party at the Suresnes Congress, in France.

By the time of Franco&#x27;s death, González had become the most prominent figure among the left-wing of the democratic opposition to the regime, and played a critical role, along with then serving Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez, in the Spanish transition to democracy. During the Suárez government, General and Deputy Prime Minister Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado asked González not to raise the debate of the Civil War and Francoist repression until the death of those of his generation.

In the first democratic general election after Franco&#x27;s death, held in 1977, the PSOE became the second most-voted for party, and this served González to appear as a young, active and promising leader. However, he did not win the 1979 election and had to wait for 1982 and the dissolution of the Union of the Democratic Centre party to come into office.

==Prime Minister of Spain==
In the 1982 general election held on 28 October 1982, the PSOE gained 48.3% of the vote and 202 deputies (out of 350). On 2 December González became President of the Government of Spain, with Alfonso Guerra as his deputy. He was the first socialist to hold the post since the Spanish Civil War, and his government was the first since then in which none of its members had served under Francoism.

With a large majority in the Congress of Deputies, popularly known as &quot;the roller&quot; (Spanish: &quot;el rodillo&quot;), González&#x27;s election was met with tremendous expectation of change amongst Spaniards. Under his government various labor laws were introduced, university education was reformed and expanded, the social security system was extended and a partial legalisation of abortion became law for the first time, despite opposition from the Roman Catholic Church. González pushed for reforms and a restructuring of the economy.

Also, from 1982 to 1994, Spanish social expenditure as a percentage of the European level rose from 63.7% to 87.6%.

On 23 February 1983, the Government passed a law nationalising the company Rumasa, a private business that included merchant banking interests, on the grounds that it was at the point of bankruptcy and the government needed to protect the savings of depositors and the jobs of its 60,000 employees, a decision that aroused considerable criticism and a judicial conflict over the law that was only resolved, in favour of the government, in December 1986.

In the 1986 general election held on 22 June 1986, the PSOE gained 44.1% of the vote and 184 deputies in Parliament. González was elected prime minister for the second time. During this second term, Spain joined the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1986. González supported Spain remaining in NATO that same year in a referendum reversing his and the party&#x27;s earlier anti-NATO position. 

On 29 October 1989, he won the 1989 general election with 39.6% of the vote and 175 seats, his third successive mandate. However, he lost the outright majority he had held since 1982.

On 6 June 1993, González won the 1993 general election with 38.8% of the vote and 159 deputies. His fourth victory was marred by the fact he was forced to form a pact with nationalist political parties from Catalonia and Basque country in order to form a new government.

Towards the end of 1995 there was a debate about whether González should lead the PSOE in the forthcoming general elections. The People&#x27;s Party intensified its campaign to associate his period in office with a poor economic situation (although unemployment had begun to decline and the economic reforms of the previous decade initiated a lasting period of economic growth) and with accusations of corruption and state terrorism scandals, including allegations of waging a dirty war against the terrorist group ETA by means of the GAL. There was speculation in the press about Javier Solana as a possible replacement, but Solana was appointed Secretary General of NATO in December 1995.

In June 2020, the CIA declassified information confirming that Felipe González had authorised the creation of the GAL.

Left with no other suitable candidate, the party was again led by González and in the 1996 general election held on 3 March 1996, they gained 37.4% of the vote and 141 deputies. They lost the election to the People&#x27;s Party whose leader José María Aznar replaced González as prime minister (&quot;presidente&quot; in Spanish, not to be confused with the English use of the term) on 4 or 5 May 1996.

The Gonzalez government left behind a deep impact on the Spanish real economy, such as the expansion of the networks of highways and airports and the creation of new infrastructures, including high-speed rail in Spain. Gonzalez-led cabinets were the first to implement a national, comprehensive infrastructure program that included not only public works but theatres, museums, and secondary schools. In addition, a comprehensive welfare state was established, while improvements were made to social programmes such as pensions and unemployment benefits. A 40-hour workweek was introduced, while entitlement to paid holidays was extended to up to 30 days per year. Pension funds were also established, together with provisions for social tourism. In addition, the school-leaving age was raised from 14 to 16, while the number of educational grants was multiplied by eight.

Unemployment protection was expanded and a national education system for children under the age of six was established. Cash benefits in social housing, universal healthcare and education were introduced, along with earnings-based benefits for widowhood, sickness, disability and retirement. A Ministry of Social Affairs was also set up, allowing for social services to be decentralised in the early Nineties and to be available to all citizens, rather than only to those with social security.

The pension system was extended to needy people, universal public schooling was expanded from all children under the age of 16, and new universities were established. Healthcare was reformed, with Gonzalez creating the National Health Service and accelerating the development of primary care medicine based on health centres, where integral primary care for adults, pregnant women and paediatric patients was provided. Gonzalez presided over an increase of youth and women&#x27;s participation in government. State run Televisión Española reached a high level of quality under the direction of Pilar Miró. Private television channels were also permitted in 1990, ending the state monopoly.

Felipe González also secured Spain&#x27;s entry into the EEC, which the country joined in 1986, and consolidated democratic government. Together with François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl, he revitalized efforts to push for European integration and extension of state power. He was a supporter of Kohl&#x27;s drive for a united Germany, counteracting British and French hostility. 

He also started diplomatic relations with Israel, which had never been established by Franco because of antisemitism. Franco&#x27;s successor Adolfo Suárez also refused to recognize Israel, while González&#x27; predecessor Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo would also fail to establish relations with Israel. Gonzalez&#x27;s time as Prime Minister of Spain also marked a significant reversal in Spain&#x27;s relations with Israel, with González even becoming the first Spanish head of state to visit Israel in December 1991. He had also previously visited Israel in the 1970s under an assumed name. Spain and Israel would establish diplomatic relations on 17 January 1986. Due to his prestige, Spain also hosted the Madrid Conference of 1991 peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis; these were chaired by President George H. W. Bush of the United States and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. The bilateral Israeli–Palestinian negotiations eventually led to the exchange of letters and the subsequent signing of the Oslo I Accord, on the lawn of the White House on 13 September 1993. The negotiations that emanated from the Madrid conference, led to the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994. The Israeli–Syrian negotiations included a series of follow-on meetings, which according to some reports, came quite close, but failed to result in a peace treaty.

In the fight against terrorism, an intense police campaign secured several victories that left the terrorist organisation ETA severely debilitated. In his earlier years ETA killings totalled dozens per year (the 1987 Hipercor bombing attack in Barcelona alone killed more than 10 people), while in his latter years ETA killed far fewer. During his time as Prime Minister a group called GAL was active as a gangster-style force targeting &quot;etarras&quot; (ETA members). Several innocent people were killed and the subsequent investigations ended with some police officers and the Minister of Internal Affairs, José Barrionuevo, condemned to jail. The Constitutional Court later ratified the sentence. Among successful operations were the capture of the ETA central arsenal and archives in Sokoa (France) and the capture of the organisation&#x27;s ruling body in 1992.

However, in the final years of his mandate several cases of corruption, the most notable of which were the scandals involving Civil Guard Director Luis Roldán, further eroded popular support for the PSOE. Nonetheless González and most of his ministers generally managed to leave office with their reputations intact, although they had performed poor oversight of some lower ranking public servants, according to María Antonia Iglesias (&quot;La memoria recuperada. Lo que nunca han contado Felipe González y los dirigentes socialistas&quot;, 2003); Iglesias is very close, though, to the PSOE official line, as she served as head of the public TV broadcaster Televisión Española after appointment to the post by one of Gonzalez&#x27;s cabinets.

==After the premiership==
González ended his fourth term on 4 May 1996. Since September 1996 he has headed the Madrid-based Global Progress Foundation (FPG). At the beginning of the 34th PSOE National Congress on 20 June 1997 he surprisingly resigned as leader of the party. He also resigned from the federal executive committee, though retaining his seat in the Congress. With no clear successor he continued to exert an enormous influence over the party. He was only replaced at the 35th party Congress in July 2000 when José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero became the leader.

In 1996, González was the head of the OSCE delegation which was sent to Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a mediator in the dialogue between Serbian government and the opposition, following the mass protests which have started over the alleged electoral fraud at the 1996 Serbian local elections.

In 1997 he was considered a leading candidate to take over the position of President of the European Commission after Jacques Santer. The position ultimately went to Italy&#x27;s Romano Prodi. 
In 1999 González was put in charge of the party&#x27;s Global Progress Commission in response to globalisation. The commission&#x27;s report formed the basis of the closing declaration of the 21st Socialist International Congress on 8–9 November 1999.

He stood down as a deputy in the Spanish Parliament in March 2004.

On 27 July 2007 the Spanish Government appointed him plenipotentiary and extraordinary ambassador for the bicentenary celebrations in commemoration of the independence of Latin America. The celebrations will begin in September 2010 in Mexico.

At a summit held in Brussels on 14 December 2007, heads of state and government of European Union member states appointed González chairman of a think tank on the future of Europe. The group, consisting of up to nine prestigious personalities commissioned to drawing up a report, by June 2010, on the challenges facing the European Union from 2020 to 2030, will also look at how to achieve a closer understanding between citizens and the Union.

In December 2014, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos granted González Colombian nationality.

From 2010 to 2015, González was appointed independent director in Gas Natural-Fenosa, one of the leading energy companies in Spain, being one of the best known high-profile cases of revolving doors in Spanish politics.

Since 2015 he has taken an active role in criticising the emerging party Podemos, which he considers a populist threat, and have actively lobbied the PSOE against approaching Podemos for any possible government coalition. González supported PSOE candidate Pedro Sánchez in the 2015 and 2016 general elections, but in the aftermath Sánchez announced talks with Podemos and Catalan separatist parties. González then supported Susana Diaz faction in a bitter internal struggle which ended with PSOE facilitating the investiture of the conservative government and the dismissal of Pedro Sánchez.

In 2015 González traveled to Venezuela to support Leopoldo López and other imprisoned opposition leaders. His involvement came at the same time mainstream media and political parties were accusing emerging Podemos of having links with the Venezuelan government.

González is a member of the Club of Madrid, an independent non-profit organisation composed of 81 democratic former Presidents and Prime Ministers from 57 different countries.

In 2015, González was awarded the Distinguished Leadership Award for Public Service in the Americas Award by the Inter-American Dialogue for his tireless, effective, and ongoing public service and commitment to democracy in Latin America.

==Personal life==
González married María del Carmen Julia Romero y López in Seville on 16 July 1969 and has three children: Pablo González Romero, David González Romero and María González Romero (lawyer). He divorced Carmen Romero in 2008. In 2012 he married Mar García Vaquero.

One of his hobbies is tending bonsai trees. During his tenure at Moncloa, he received and cultivated several of them, mostly Mediterranean species, that he later donated to the Royal Botanic Garden of Madrid.

His wife Mar García Vaquero is named in the Panama Papers scandal in 2016.

<text>Chester is a village on the Chester Peninsula, Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada.

==History==
The French had been present in Acadia since the early 1600s, but when the British expanded into the area in the 1700s, Acadian settlements on the South Shore were few and tiny. After the Expulsion of the Acadians the British wanted to repopulate vacated lands, and offered land grants to colonists from New England, which was experiencing a population explosion. In 1761, led by founders Timothy Houghton and Rev. John Seccombe, New England Planters were granted lands in the Chester area, then called Shoreham.

During the American Revolution, Nova Scotia was invaded regularly by American Revolutionary forces and privateers, including the 1782 Raid on Chester. During this time some of the New England immigrants proved to be neither neutral nor loyal in the conflict, including founders Timothy Houghton and John Seccombe against whom criminal charges were brought for sedition. Military officer Jonathan Prescott was also suspected of being an American Patriot sympathizer.

During the 1800s Chester was an important site for coastal commerce, with economic activities including lumbering, shipbuilding, shipping, and fishing. During the War of 1812, the American privateer was trapped off the shores of Chester. To avoid capture, a crew member scuttled the ship, killing most of the crew.

In 1922 a statue was erected in memory of 54 soldiers from the area who were killed in World War I, cast by Scottish sculptor J. Massey Rhind. After the war the Women&#x27;s Institute of Nova Scotia established the Zoé Vallé Memorial Library.

In 2002 it was proposed to incorporate Chester as a town, thereby leaving the Chester Municipal District. Many residents fought the motion and won the right to a plebiscite, which led to the defeat of the motion in February 2003.

==Schools==
Chester has an elementary school, Chester District School (grades Primary–5) and a middle school, Chester Area Middle School or CAMS as it is known (grades 6–8). Forest Heights Community School brings together students from all of the Municipality of the District of Chester and Tancook Island for grades 9–12.

==Culture==
The Chester Playhouse, is a charitable organization for the promotion of performing arts. The building is a cinema built in 1939 and converted in 1963. In 1987 the building was purchased by Christopher Ondaatje, who donated it to the Theatre Council. Its capacity is 176. The theatre has a year-round program with a variety of performance types, including local folk musician Old Man Luedecke.

The Chester and Area Family Resource Centre provides support to new parents.

Chester was a filming site for the TV series &quot;Haven&quot; and for parts of &quot;The Curse of Oak Island&quot;.

Founded in 1873 and incorporated in 1906, the Chester Brass Band is a British-style brass ensemble based in Chester, Nova Scotia. The band is a non-profit volunteer organization, funded wholly by its membership, concert series, and local patrons. The Chester Brass Band&#x27;s repertoire includes classical works, marches, hymns, popular melodies and original works written or arranged specifically for brass band. The band also includes smaller subgroups: a Dixieland band, stage band and small brass ensembles. The band has performed around Nova Scotia and across the world, often accompanying guest choirs, vocalists and instrumental soloists of distinction. On five occasions, Chester Brass was a top-three finisher at the International Brass Band Championships.

<doc id="273235" wikidata="Q203708" url="?curid=273235" title="Manuel Azaña">
<text>Manuel Azaña Díaz (; 10 January 1880 – 3 November 1940) was a Spanish politician who served as Prime Minister of the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1933 and 1936), organizer of the Popular Front in 1935 and the last President of the Republic (1936–1939). He was the most prominent leader of the Republican cause during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939.

A published author in the 1910s, he stood out in the pro-Allies camp during World War I. He was sharply critical towards the Generation of &#x27;98, the reimagination of the Spanish Middle Ages, Imperial Spain and the 20th century yearnings for a praetorian refurbishment of the country. Azaña followed instead the examples of the French Enlightenment and the Third French Republic, and took a political quest for democracy in the 1920s while defending the notion of homeland as the &quot;democratic equality of all citizens towards the law&quot; that made him embrace republicanism.

After the Proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in April 1931, Azaña became Minister of War of the Provisional Government and enacted military reform, looking to develop a modern armed forces with fewer army officers. He later became Prime Minister in October 1931.
The Spanish Civil War broke out while he was President of Spain. With the defeat of the Republic in 1939, he fled to France, resigned from office, and died in exile only a year later at age 60.

== Early career ==

Born into a wealthy family, Manuel Azaña Díaz was orphaned at a very young age. He studied in the Universidad Complutense, the Cisneros Institute and the Agustinos of El Escorial. He was awarded a Lawyer&#x27;s licence by the University of Zaragoza in 1897, and a doctorate by the Universidad Complutense in 1900.

In 1909, he achieved a position at the Main Directorate of the Registries and practised the profession of civil law notary, and travelled to Paris in 1911. He became involved in politics and in 1914 joined the Reformist Republican Party led by Melquíades Álvarez. He collaborated in the production of various newspapers, such as &quot;El Imparcial&quot; and &quot;El Sol&quot;. He also joined the Freemasons.

During World War I, he covered operations on the Western Front for various newspapers. His treatment was very sympathetic to the French, and he may have been sponsored by French military intelligence. Afterwards he edited the magazines &quot;Pluma&quot; and &quot;España&quot; between 1920 and 1924, founding the former with his brother-in-law Cipriano Rivas Cherif. He was secretary of the Ateneo de Madrid (1913–1920), becoming its president in 1930. He was a candidate for the province of Toledo in 1918 and 1923, but lost on both occasions. In 1926 he founded the &quot;Acción Republicana&quot; (&quot;Republican Action&quot;) party with José Giral. 

A strong critic of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, Azaña published a stirring manifesto against the dictator and King Alfonso XIII in 1924. In 1930, he was a signatory of the &quot;Pact of San Sebastián&quot;, which united all the republican and regionalist parties in Spain against Primo de Rivera and the King.

On 12 April 1931, republican candidates swept the municipal elections. This was seen as repudiation of Primo de Rivera and the monarchy. Two days later, the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed and the King forced into exile.

==In the government==

Niceto Alcalá-Zamora, prime minister of the provisional government of the Republic, named Azaña Minister of War on 14 April. Alcalá-Zamora resigned in October, and Azaña replaced him as prime minister. When the new constitution was adopted on 9 December, Azaña continued as prime minister, leading a coalition of left-wing parties, including his own &quot;Acción Republicana&quot; and the Socialists (PSOE), while Alcalá-Zamora became President of the Republic.

Azaña pursued some of the major reforms anticipated by the republican program. He introduced work accident insurance, reduced the size of the Spanish Army, and removed some monarchist officers. He also moved to reduce the power and influence of the Roman Catholic Church, abolishing Church-operated schools and charities, and greatly expanding state-operated secular schools.

He defended these measures by saying &quot;Do not tell me that this is contrary to freedom. It is a matter of public health&quot;.

The Spanish legislature, the Cortes, also enacted an agrarian reform program, under which large private landholdings (&quot;latifundia&quot;) were to be confiscated and distributed among the rural poor. However, Azaña was a &quot;middle-class republican&quot;, not a socialist. He and his followers were not enthusiastic for this program. The agrarian law did not include state-funded collective farms, as the Socialists wanted, and was not enacted until late 1932. It was also clumsily written, and threatened many relatively small landholders more than the latifundists. The Azaña government also did very little to carry it out: only 12,000 families received land in the first two years.

In addition, Azaña did little to reform the taxation system to shift the burden of government onto the wealthy. Also, the government continued to support the owners of industry against wildcat strikes or attempted takeovers by militant workers, especially the anarcho-syndicalists of the &quot;Confederación Nacional del Trabajo&quot; (National Confederation of Labour or CNT). Confrontation with the CNT erupted in bloody violence at Casas Viejas (now Benalup) and Alt Llobregat. Violence against protesters also occurred against non CNT-affiliated workers during Castilblanco and Arnedo events.

Meanwhile, Azaña&#x27;s extreme anti-clerical program alienated many moderates. In local elections held in early 1933, most of the seats went to conservative and centrist parties. Elections to the &quot;Tribunal of Constitutional Guarantees&quot; (the Republic&#x27;s &quot;Supreme Court&quot;) followed this pattern.

Thus Azaña came into conflict with both the right and far left. He called a vote of confidence, but two-thirds of the Cortes abstained, and Alcalá-Zamora ordered Azaña&#x27;s resignation on 8 September 1933. New elections were held on 19 November 1933.

These elections were won by the right-wing &quot;Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas&quot; (CEDA) and the centrist Radical Republican Party. Radical leader Alejandro Lerroux became prime minister. Azaña temporarily withdrew from politics and returned to literary activity.

Azaña&#x27;s self-imposed political retreat lasted only a short while; in 1934 he founded the Republican Left party, the fusion of &quot;Acción Republicana&quot; with the Radical Socialist Republican Party, led by Marcelino Domingo, and the &quot;Organización Republicana Gallega Autónoma&quot; (ORGA) of Santiago Casares Quiroga.

On 5 October 1934, the PSOE and Communists attempted a general left-wing rebellion. The rebellion had a temporary success in Asturias and Barcelona, but was over in two weeks. Azaña was in Barcelona that day, and the Lerroux-CEDA government tried to implicate him. He was arrested and charged with complicity in the rebellion.

In fact, Azaña had no connection with the rebellion, and the attempt to convict him on spurious charges soon collapsed, giving him the prestige of a martyr. He was released from prison in January 1935. Azaña then helped organize the &quot;Frente Popular&quot; (&quot;Popular Front&quot;), a coalition of all the major left-wing parties for the elections of 16 February 1936.

The Front won the election, and Azaña became prime minister again on 19 February. His parliamentary coalition included the PSOE and Communists. This alarmed conservatives, who remembered their attempt to seize power only 17 months earlier. The Azaña government proclaimed an immediate amnesty for all prisoners from the rebellion, which increased conservative concerns. Socialists and Communists were appointed to important positions in the Assault Guard and Civil Guard.

Also, with the Popular Front victory, radicalized peasants led by the Socialists began seizing land on 25 March. Azaña chose to legitimize these actions rather than challenge them. Radical Socialists vied with Communists in calling for violent revolution and forcible suppression of the Right. Political assassinations by Communists, Socialists, and anarchosyndicalists were frequent, as were retaliations by increasingly radicalized conservatives.

Azaña insisted that the danger to the Republic was from the Right and on 11 March, the government suppressed the Falange.

Azaña was a man of very strong convictions. Stanley G. Payne, an iconic figure of the of Francoist revisionism, tentatively described him as &quot;the last great figure of traditional Castilian arrogance in the history of Spain.&quot; As a &quot;middle class republican&quot;, he was implacably hostile to the monarchy and the Church. The CEDA, which was pro-Catholic, he therefore regarded as illegitimate, and also any and all monarchists, even those who supported parliamentary democracy.

In the view of Paul Preston, nothing indicates more directly the value of the services provided by Azaña to the Republic than the hatred felt towards him by the ideologues and propagandists of the Francoist cause.

==Presidency==


When the Cortes met in April, it removed President Alcalá-Zamora from office. On 7 April 1936, Azaña was elected President of the Republic; Quiroga succeeded him as prime minister. Azaña by this time was profoundly depressed by the increasing disorder, but could see no way to counter it. Stanley Payne reports that in the Cortes meeting of April 15, Azaña stated &quot;I don&#x27;t intend to serve as anyone&#x27;s guardian angel&quot; and told the right-wing deputies &quot;[D]id you not want violence...? Then take to violence. Be prepared for the consequences&quot;, despite the fact that CEDA had adhered to the law. He would later regret these remarks and try to backtrack by blaming the violence and unrest on the Spanish national character but this gave the impression the government was disinterested in enforcing the law. 

Azaña repeatedly warned his fellow Republicans that the lack of unity within the government was a serious threat to the Republic&#x27;s stability. Political violence continued: there were over 200 assassinations in February through early July.

By July, the military conspiracy to overthrow the Republic was well underway, but nothing definite had been planned. Then
on 13 July, José Calvo Sotelo, leader of a small monarchist grouping in the Cortes, was arrested and murdered by a mixed group of Socialist gunmen and Assault Guards. Azaña and Quiroga did not act effectively against the killers.

On 17 July, right-wing, Falangist, and monarchist elements in the Republican army proclaimed the overthrow of the Republic. The rebellion failed in Madrid, however. Azaña replaced Quiroga as Prime Minister with his ally Diego Martínez Barrio, and the government attempted a compromise with the rebels, which was rejected by General Mola.

On 13 September, Azaña authorized Minister of Finance Juan Negrín to move the nation&#x27;s gold reserve to wherever Negrin thought it would be secure. Negrin shipped it to the Soviet Union, which claimed it in payment for arms supplied to the Republic.

In 1938, Azaña moved to Barcelona with the rest of the Republican government, and was cut off there when the monarchist forces drove to the sea between Barcelona and Valencia.

===Road to exile===
====La Barata====

Since February 1938 Azaña resided in La Barata, an isolated mansion at the outskirts of Matadepera near Terrassa. Built by Lliga politician Francesc Salvans, killed by the Republicans, between late 1937 and early 1938 it was undergoing preparation works to host the head of state. The place was some 30 km away from Barcelona and some 80 km from the French frontier. Already on January 13, 1939 General Juan Hernández Saravia advised the president to leave the place given rapid advance of Nationalist troops, the suggestion repeated by Negrin on January 17. On January 19 Saravia insisted the president evacuates; Azaña commenced preparations.

====Llavaneras====

The president, his family and his entourage, including secretaries and military AdCs, left La Barata on January 21 (Nationalist troops would seize the place on January 24). Following a drive of some 50 km east in the afternoon hours, the column of cars his entourage were travelling in reached the town of Llavaneras (now San Andreu de Llavaneres), north of Mataró, some 30 km from Barcelona and some 100 km from the French frontier. It turned out that the premises, supposed to host Azaña, were unsuitable; they spent the night in a randomly selected and hastily prepared house in a park.

====Caldetas====

The following day, on January 22, some members of Azaña&#x27;s family left to France. The president proceeded to the coastal town of Caldetas (now Caldes d&#x27;Estrac), some 4 km away, where in another makeshift premises he spent the following one or two nights, while remainder of his belongings were being fetched from La Barata. During these few days he was almost entirely isolated, with little to no contact either with the government or the military command; at the same time, the evacuation of Barcelona had commenced.

====Peralada====

The presidential column departed north from Caldetas on January 23 or 24 (the city would be seized by the Nationalists on January 28), and following a drive of some 90-km, in the evening hours they reached the castle in Peralada, some 120 km from Barcelona, only 15 km from the French frontier; the Pyrenees were clearly visible from their new premises. 

It was in Peralada that contact with the government, representatives of the Cortes, the Republican military and foreign envoys, was re-established. Castillo de Peralada remained Azaña&#x27;s residence for around a week. During this period Barcelona fell to the Nationalists. On January 30 Negrín visited the president and offered to have an aircraft ready to take Azaña to France, should immediate evacuation be necessary. The president declined the proposal, fearing that Negrín would rather forcibly take Azana to the central zone, Valencia or Madrid.

====Agullana====

Some time at the end of January, early February (the exact day is unclear, January 31 at the earliest, February 2 at the latest) the president left Peralada and moved some 20 km north-west, to Agullana. It was a village in the Pyrennees, some 4 km from the French frontier, located by a secondary drive and away from main roads, which were crammed with refugees trying to flee Barcelona and Catalonia. Agullana was at the time was also hosting the staff of general Rojo. The president spent one night there.

====La Vajol====

The following day, probably either on February 2 or February 3, Azaña left Agullana and drove some 5 km up the road, to the last Spanish settlement some 2 km from the French frontier, the hamlet of La Vajol. It is there he met his last foreign diplomatic representatives. On February 4 Negrín visited Azaña in La Vajol and suggested that, in view of the advance of Nationalist troops, the president cross to France as soon as possible.

====French frontier====

On February 5, at 6 AM, when it was still dark, Azaña, his wife, his entourage and some state officials departed La Vajol (which would be seized by the Nationalists on February 9), fleeing north to France. What should have been a drive of a few minutes turned into a slightly longer journey. The leading police car broke down and blocked the narrow, winding, mountainous road. All the passengers had to leave their cars and proceed on foot, struggling on what proved a slippery, iced surface. The party encountered French &quot;gendarmes&quot; sometime after dawn.

==Last days==
On 3 March, Manuel Azana resigned as President of the Republic, rather than return to Madrid with the rest of the government. Both Nationalist and Republican commentators have condemned this decision as &quot;desertion&quot;.

Azaña lived in exile in France for more than a year after the war, eventually being trapped by the invasion of France by Germany and institution of the Vichy regime. Even then, his safety was ensured due to the intervention of the Mexican government, which had refused to extend diplomatic recognition to Franco&#x27;s regime (Mexico would not resume relations with Spain until 1977, two years after Franco&#x27;s death). To prevent his arrest and extradition, Azaña was vested with Mexican citizenship and named Honorary Ambassador, thus granting him diplomatic immunity. His residence was officially an extension of the Mexican Embassy and therefore under Mexican jurisdiction, and was closely monitored by Mexican military personnel.

Azaña died of natural causes on 3 November 1940, in Montauban, France. He received the last rites of Catholicism before his death. The Vichy authorities refused to allow his coffin to be covered with the Spanish Republican flag. The coffin was covered instead with the flag of Mexico.

==Writings==

In his diaries and memoirs, on which he worked meticulously, Azaña vividly describes the various personality and ideological conflicts between himself and various Republican leaders, such as Largo Caballero and Negrín. Azaña&#x27;s writings during the Civil War have been resources for study by scholars of the workings of the Republican government during the conflict. Along with his extensive memoirs and diaries, Azaña also wrote a number of well-known speeches. His speech on 18 July 1938 is one of the best known in which he implores his fellow Spaniards to seek reconciliation after the fighting ends and emphasizes the need for &quot;Peace, Pity, and Pardon.&quot;

Azaña wrote a play during the Civil War, &quot;La velada en Benicarló&quot; (&quot;Vigil in Benicarló&quot;). Having worked on the play during the previous weeks, Azaña dictated the final version while he was trapped in Barcelona during the &quot;Days of May&quot; violence. In the play, Azaña uses various characters to espouse the various ideological, political and social perspectives present within the Republic during the war. He portrayed and explored the rivalries and conflicts that were damaging the political cohesion of the Republic.

Azaña was aware of General Franco and Jose Sanjurjo&#x27;s firm determination to overthrow the Republic, which would culminate in the Law of Political Responsibilities &quot;(Ley de Responsabilidades Políticas)&quot; at the end of the war. Saddened, he reflected:

During the many years of his political activity, Azaña kept diaries. His work &quot;Diarios completos: monarquía, república, Guerra Civil&quot; was published posthumously in Spanish in 2003.

==Political legacy==
According to British historian Piers Brendon, Manuel Azaña was the leading Republican politician. He was a well-educated would-be writer who &quot;plotted to rid Spain of the yoke of church and king&quot;. A brilliant speaker, Azaña was graceful in word, but clumsy in action. &quot;He was a polemical bullfighter but a political bulldozer.&quot;. Although he preached a lofty form of liberalism, he had a mixed record as prime minister. He wanted to introduce a welfare state with minimum-wage, sickness benefits and paid holidays, but he never attempted to deal with the overwhelming problem of peasant poverty. He was so concerned to balance the budget that he cut back on land redistribution. He worked more effectively to establish a secular state, breaking the Catholic church&#x27;s hold on education, legalizing civil marriage, seizing Catholic properties, expelling the Jesuit order, and tolerating the burning of church buildings such as convents for nuns. &quot;All the convents in Spain are not worth a single Republican life,&quot; he proclaimed. As opposition mounted, he censored the press, exiled his enemies to North Africa, and formed a private militia force of Assault Guards. Meanwhile, his allies the anarchists were assassinating priests and nuns, and burning convents. Azaña tried to reform the army, by replacing outmoded equipment and closing its military academy. In the process he demoted its most promising general—young Francisco Franco. Azaña was defeated in the elections of November 1933, having antagonized extremists and alienated the moderates. He made a comeback in 1936 but could not hold his coalition together in the face of a civil war. In recent decades he has become a hero of the left in Spain.

<text>Adam Cadre (born February 5, 1974, in Silver Spring, Maryland) is an American writer active in a number of forms—novels, screenplays, webcomics, essays—but best known for his work in interactive fiction.

==Biography==

Cadre&#x27;s 1998 piece &quot;Photopia&quot; pioneered a new direction in interactive fiction, removing the puzzle and resource-management elements that had previously been dominant; it has been cited as &quot;hugely influential to IF development&quot; and &quot;important to video games as a whole, to the advancement of our understanding of the interactive medium.&quot; His next IF work, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Varicella&quot;, won several XYZZY Awards and became the subject of academic study. His game &quot;9:05&quot; is commonly seen as a solid entry point for people wanting to engage with interactive fiction.

Chief among his non-interactive work is a novel, &quot;Ready, Okay!&quot; (2000).

==Lyttle Lytton Contest==

The &quot;Lyttle Lytton Contest&quot;, run by Adam Cadre, is a diminutive derivative of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, and was first awarded in the year 2001. Both are tongue-in-cheek contests that take place annually and in which entrants are invited &quot;to compose the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels.&quot; The Lyttle Lytton Contest varies from the Bulwer-Lytton in favoring shorter first sentences, initially limited to 25 words or fewer. For the 2008 competition, the maximum combined word count of an entrant&#x27;s submission was increased to 30 words, and an individual entry could consist of multiple sentences. For 2011, the limit was raised to 33 words, and for 2012, a limit of 200 characters was established instead.

<doc id="273239" wikidata="Q1523727" url="?curid=273239" title="Henry Ford Company">
<text>The Henry Ford Company was an automobile manufacturer active from 1901 to 1902. Named after Henry Ford, it was his second company after the Detroit Automobile Company, which had been founded in 1899. The Henry Ford Company was founded November 1901 from the reorganization of the Detroit Automobile Company. The company, much like the Detroit Automobile Company, was plagued by disputes between Ford and his investors, and Ford left in 1902. Later that year, the company was reorganized as the Cadillac Automobile Company under the suggestion of Henry M. Leland. Cadillac, whose early vehicles were identical in design to those of Ford&#x27;s later Ford Motor Company except for the engine, would develop a reputation for precision engineering and was acquired by the nascent General Motors (GM) in 1909, becoming GM&#x27;s luxury marque. Ford would eventually find success with the Ford Motor Company, and is considered one of the primary pioneers of the automobile.

==Background==

The Detroit Automobile Company was founded in 1899 and made its first vehicle in January 1900.

==Collapse and reorganization==
In March 1902, Ford left the company following a dispute with his financial backers, William Murphy and Lemuel Bowen, as Ford was devoting considerable time to the sport of auto racing and his Ford 999 race car. In a final settlement, Ford left with his name and $900; he went on to start the Ford Motor Company in 1903 at the Ford Mack Avenue Plant.

In August 1902, Henry M. Leland, a local manufacturer of precision gears and engines, was brought in by the investors to appraise the plant and equipment prior to selling them. Instead, Leland persuaded them to continue in the automobile business, showing them an engine he had designed a year earlier for Olds Motor Works that was not adopted due to a fire at the latter&#x27;s premises. The Henry Ford Company reorganized that year as the Cadillac Automobile Company, named in honor of Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, the founder of Detroit.

==Subsequent history==
===Cadillac===

Cadillac&#x27;s first car, the Cadillac Runabout and Tonneau, was completed on October 17, 1902, the Cadillac. Based on Henry Ford&#x27;s design (except for the engine, designed by Leland &amp; Faulconer), it was practically identical to the 1903 Ford Model A.

Located in Detroit at 450 Amsterdam Street, at the intersection of Cass Avenue and Amsterdam Street, the original manufacturing plant was designed by architectural firm George C. Mason &amp; Son, and remained in operation under Cadillac until 1921, when the Detroit Assembly factory was built at Clark Street. The factory after Leland made some improvements, was 275,000 square feet, with its own forge, a machine shop, and a foundry for both iron and brass. The factory ran 24 hours a day, producing 40 Cadillacs in that time period. The original location is approximately 2 miles east of the current Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly, where Cadillacs are currently built. It is approximately half a mile southwest from Cadillac Place, GM&#x27;s headquarters from 1922 until 2001, when GM moved to the GM Renaissance Center next to the Detroit River.

===Ford===

Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor Company in 1903 and began producing the Model A that year. The Model A was successful, returning a profit for the Ford Motor Company and securing its financial well-being. Ford expanded with the Model B and Model C in 1904, expanding its lineup to seven models by 1907. Ford adopted mass production with a new model, the Model T, which it introduced in 1908. It proved wildly successful, and by 1914 Ford had produced almost 90 percent of the world&#x27;s automobiles. By the time it ended production in 1927, more than 15 million had been sold. In 1999, a panel of 126 automotive experts, combined with the votes of the general public, named the Model T as the Car of the Century.

<text>Julio Anguita González (21 November 194116 May 2020) was a Spanish politician. He was Mayor of Córdoba from 1979 to 1986, coordinator of United Left (IU) between 1989 and 1999, and Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) from 1988 to 1998. Due to his enormous influence and his absolute majorities in the Córdoba city council, he was nicknamed &quot;el califa rojo&quot; (&quot;the red Caliph&quot;).

==Biography==
Anguita was born in Fuengirola, Málaga, on 21 November 1941, into a family with a military background, son of an army sergeant and grandson of a &quot;guardia civil&quot;. He took teaching studies (&quot;magisterio&quot;) and later earned a degree in history at the University of Barcelona. Anguita, who had been a militant in Christian grassroots movements, joined the clandestine Communist Party of Spain (PCE) in 1972, when he already had obtained a post as teacher. Five years later he became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Andalusia (PCA).

===Mayor of Córdoba===
In 1979, he was elected as Mayor of Córdoba with a clear majority in the first municipal elections of the current democracy, which thus acquired the distinction of being the first provincial capital governed by Communists since the Second Republic. His administration overcame the misgivings felt by many, contributing to the establishment of democratic normality and earning him appreciation as a leader in his party, as well as the tensions with the councilors of the PSOE and UCD. He was reelected in 1983 with an overwhelming absolute majority, earning the nickname &quot;the Red Caliph&quot;. It was in this second term when he requested UNESCO for the declaration of the Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba as World Heritage Site, which was finally achieved in 1984.

In 1986 he resigned and announced that he will not seek for reelection. However, shortly afterwards he would jump into the Andalusian political sphere when he became a candidate of the United Left (IU) for the President of the Regional Government of Andalusia in the 1986 regional election in which he obtained 19 seats and the third political force in Parliament of Andalusia.

===Secretary General of the PCE and leader of IU===
In February 1988 he was elected as secretary general of the Communist Party, and the following year he became the leader of United Left, becoming the candidate to Prime Minister in the 1989 general election gaining 17 seats in the Congress of Deputies. He was also candidate in the 1993 and 1996 elections, the years when IU had better than average electoral results.

He was famously accused multiple times of making a &quot;pincer&quot; against the PSOE teaming up with the People&#x27;s Party. Anguita later declared that &quot;the pincer&quot; (&quot;la pinza&quot;) had been a fabrication of the media and disgruntled IU members such as Diego López Garrido and Cristina Almeida who ultimately formed the Democratic Party of the New Left.

He left the general secretariat on 5 December 1998 during the XV Congress of the PCE, asking communist militants to demand the principles of anti-capitalism, anti-system and the fight for an egalitarian society. He politically equated the PSOE and the PP and called on the militancy to regain the fight on the street.

After a third cardiovascular problem at the end of 1999 he relinquished his candidacy for chairman in the 2000 general election to Francisco Frutos on health issues. Likewise, he was relieved as general secretary of the PCE by Francisco Frutos on 7 December 1998. In the 6th Assembly of IU, on 29 October 2000, he was replaced as General Coordinator by Gaspar Llamazares.

===Later years===
After his political career, he returned to his job as a history teacher and renounced written the life pay as a former deputy.

On 1 June 2005, at the XVII Congress of the PCE, he presented a document calling for the re-founding of the party, reflecting on the International Communist Movement. He pointed out the negative impact brought by the fall of the Soviet Union and the uncriticalness and submission of the unions and the Left to the established capitalist order. On 22 April 2008, he sent the Federal Committee of the PCE a document in which he defended the need for a &#x27;refounding&#x27; of IU. In his letter, he attributed the electoral debacle to the &quot;lack of a clear line&quot;, and the absence of a coherent program. He defended radical democracy, the fight for the Third Republic and federalism, both for the coalition&#x27;s organizational model and for the defended state model. In his opinion, the debate should open at the next federal assembly of IU.

In 2012, in the midst of the Spanish economic crisis, he promoted and became the figurehead of the (&quot;Civic Front &#x27;We are Majority&#x27;&quot;), a social movement vowing to gather and mobilise the social majority who was suffering the effects of the crisis and the imposed austerity.

It was usual for him to be interviewed on political talk shows, especially on the show &quot;La sexta noche&quot;. His last interview was on 8 May 2020, a day before being admitted to the hospital for the &quot;Todo es mentira&quot; program, being interviewed by presenter Risto Mejide and where he stated &quot;let&#x27;s reflect on how we are going to live so that everyone lives well&quot; during pandemic in Spain.

===Death===
On 16 May 2020 he died after being hospitalized on 9 May at Hospital Universitario Reina Sofía, Córdoba, after suffering a heart attack at his home. His death shocked Spanish politics; Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez deeply regretted his death, leader of the conservative People&#x27;s Party Pablo Casado remembered his passionate defense of his ideals, while president of Andalusia Juan Manuel Moreno Bonilla recognized the respect and recognition that he had for his &quot;ability to reach necessary agreements despite the discrepancies&quot;. Second Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias, who mourned the death of &quot;our best political reference&quot;, as well as President of Cuba Miguel Díaz-Canel called him an &quot;historic leader&quot;.

== Positions ==

He advocated a political program for United Left based on the &quot;two shores theory&quot;, consisting of the establishment of differences between, on the one hand, the People&#x27;s Party (PP) and the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), and, on the other, the United Left. He also said that pacts with PSOE should be established under programmatic single agreements, not systematically (a conception expressed in his well-known motto &quot;programa, programa, programa&quot;).

A firm opponent at the time of the signing of the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992, he later blamed the treaty for &quot;that big crazy idea that [the] Euro is&quot;, &quot;a mix of very different economies in which Germany, as the banker, takes it all&quot;. In 2018 he co-authored along with Manolo Monereo and Héctor Illueca a series of provocative articles defending specific measures taken by the Italian government of alliance between the 5 Star Movement and the Northern League while feeding a discourse against the European Union.

The deep Catholic convictions he professed in his youth marked him to the point he opposed the idea of abortion rights when he was Mayor of Córdoba. Back then he also expressed to journalist Pedro J. Ramírez his admiration for the validity of the political thought of José Antonio Primo de Rivera. His critics within IU resented his main political handicap as leader as an alleged lack of &quot;[political] party culture&quot;. He declared Vox to be not Fascist, but &quot;representative of an extreme right [that would be a] daughter of a capitalism in crisis&quot;, unlike some Falanges that were &quot;anti-capitalist&quot; and &quot;talked about the nationalization of banks&quot;.

In 2018, as embryonic plans for a new movement to promote the third Spanish Republic (with Anguita, Illueca and Monereo reportedly on board) were announced in the media, Anguita, a staunch republican, declared to &quot;El Español&quot; that the new Republic &quot;needs to be transversal&quot;, &quot;Neither Right nor Left&quot;.

He criticized the provisional imprisonment of the Catalan independence leaders and deemed them political prisoners, denying the existence of a crime of rebellion. He rejected a unilateral declaration of independence, as well as the application of article 155 of the Constitution, considering that a consultation with the population was the solution.

== Personal life ==
Anguita married Antonia Rojas Parrado in 1969. They had two children, Ana Anguita Parrado and Julio Anguita Parrado. They divorced in 1977. In 2007 he wed María Agustina Martín Caño.

Julio Anguita Parrado, a journalist, died on 7 April 2003, while embedded as a foreign reporter to the US 3rd Infantry Division in the Iraq War, when the Headquarters of the 2nd Brigade were hit by an Iraqi ballistic missile south of Baghdad. Julio Anguita senior was attending a meeting promoting a Spanish Third Republic at the time. When he heard of the circumstances of his son&#x27;s death, he told the audience &quot;Damn wars and the scoundrels who wage them&quot; (&quot;Malditas sean las guerras y los canallas que las hacen&quot;), phrase that ended up being an anti-war emblem.

==Publications==
After his first book &quot;Corazón Rojo&quot; (Red Heart, 2005) where he testifies over his life after the cardiovascular problems, he published in 2007 the &quot;Prologue&quot; of the book &quot;La Globalización Neoliberal y sus repercusiones en la educación&quot; (The Neoliberal Globalization and its impact in the education) from the University teacher and researcher Enrique Díez, and in 2008 he published &quot;El Tiempo y la Memoria&quot; (Time and Memory), written in collaboration with the Cordoban journalist and writer Rafael Martínez Simancas where he manifests his will to keep fighting.

<doc id="273241" wikidata="Q865026" url="?curid=273241" title="Patriarch of Antioch">
<text>The Patriarch of Antioch is a traditional title held by the bishop of Antioch (modern-day Antakya, Turkey). As the traditional &quot;overseer&quot; (, , from which the word &quot;bishop&quot; is derived) of the first gentile Christian community, the position has been of prime importance in Pauline Christianity from its earliest period. This diocese is one of the few for which the names of its bishops from the apostolic beginnings have been preserved. Today five churches use the title of patriarch of Antioch: one Eastern Orthodox (the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch); one Oriental Orthodox (the Syriac Orthodox Church); and three Eastern Catholic (the Maronite, Syriac Catholic, and Melkite Greek Catholic Churches).

According to the pre-congregation church tradition, this ancient patriarchate was founded by the Apostle Saint Peter. The patriarchal succession was disputed at the time of the Meletian schism in 362 and again after the Council of Chalcedon in 451, when there were rival Melkite and non-Chalcedonian claimants to the see. After a 7th-century succession dispute in the Melkite church, the Maronites began appointing a Maronite patriarch as well. After the First Crusade, the Catholic Church began appointing a Latin Church patriarch of Antioch, though this became strictly titular after the Fall of Antioch in 1268, and was abolished completely in 1964. In the 18th century, succession disputes in the Greek Orthodox and Syriac Orthodox Churches of Antioch led to factions of those churches entering into communion with Rome under claimants to the patriarchate: respectively the Melkite Greek Catholic patriarch of Antioch and the Syriac Catholic patriarch of Antioch. Their respective Orthodox progenitors are the Greek Orthodox patriarch of Antioch and the Syriac Orthodox patriarch of Antioch.

==History==
===First Christians===

In Roman times, Antioch was the principal city of the Roman Province of Syria, and the fourth largest city of the Roman Empire, after Rome, Ephesus and Alexandria.

The church in Antioch was the first to be called &quot;Christian,&quot; according to Acts. According to tradition, Saint Peter established the church in Antioch which was the first major Christian area before the 4th century and was the city&#x27;s first bishop, before going to Rome to found the Church there. Ignatius of Antioch (died c. 107), counted as the third bishop of the city, was a prominent apostolic father. By the fourth century, the bishop of Antioch had become the most senior bishop in a region covering modern-day eastern Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Iran. His hierarchy served the largest number of Christians in the known world at that time. The synods of Antioch met at a basilica named for Julian the Martyr, whose relics it contained.

Despite being overshadowed in ecclesiastical authority by the patriarch of Constantinople in the later years of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Antiochene Patriarch remained the most independent, powerful, and trusted of the eastern patriarchs. The Antiochene church was a centre of Christian learning, second only to Alexandria. In contrast to the Hellenistic-influenced Christology of Alexandria, Rome, and Constantinople, Antiochene theology was greatly influenced by Rabbinic Judaism and other modes of West Asian monotheistic thought—emphasizing the single, transcendent divine substance (), which in turn led to adoptionism in certain extremes, and to the clear distinction of two natures of Christ (: dyophysitism): one human, the other divine. Lastly, compared to the Patriarchates in Constantinople, Rome, and Alexandria which for various reasons became mired in the theology of imperial state religion, many of its Patriarchs managed to straddle the divide between the controversies of Christology and imperial unity through its piety and straightforward grasp of early Christian thought which was rooted in its primitive Church beginnings.

===Chalcedonian split===
The Christological controversies that followed the Council of Chalcedon in 451 resulted in a long struggle for the Patriarchate between those who accepted and those who rejected the Council. The issue came to a head in 512, when a synod was convened in Sidon by the non-Chalcedonians, which resulted in Flavian II (a Chalcedonian) being replaced as Patriarch by Severus (a non-Chalcedonian). The non-Chalcedonians under Severus eventually came to be called the Syriac Orthodox Church (which is a part of the Oriental Orthodox Church), which has continued to appoint its own Syriac patriarchs of Antioch. The Chalcedonians refused to recognise the dismissal and continued to recognise Flavian as Patriarch forming a rival church. From 518, on the death of Flavian and the appointment of his successor, the Chalcedonian Church became known as the Byzantines&#x27; (&quot;Rūm&quot;) Church of Antioch. In the Middle Ages, as the Byzantine Church of Antioch became more and more dependent on Constantinople, it began to use the Byzantine rite.

The internal schisms such as that over Monophysitism were followed by the Islamic conquests which began in the late 7th century, resulting in the patriarch&#x27;s ecclesiastical authority becoming entangled in the politics of imperial authority and later Islamic hegemony. Being considered independent of both Byzantine and Arab Muslim power but in essence occupied by both, the &quot;de facto&quot; power of the Antiochene patriarchs faded. Additionally, the city suffered several natural disasters including major earthquakes throughout the 4th and 6th centuries and anti-Christian conquests beginning with the Zoroastrian Persians in the 6th century, then the Muslim Arabs in the seventh century before the city could be recovered by the Byzantine Empire in 969.

===Maronite split===
Although Aramaic-speaking followers of the 4th-century hermit Saint Maron did accept the terms of Chalcedon, they adhered to Monothelitism (due to impossible communication with the wider church, being surrounded after the Muslim expansions, meaning they couldn’t single it out as a heresy until re-establishment of communication with Rome) until the 12th century through establishment of communion with Rome. Although the Maronites initially fought alongside the Byzantines in their struggle against the Arabs, in 685 AD, they appointed a Patriarch for themselves, St. John Maron, who became the first Patriarch of the Maronite Church. The appointing of a Patriarch made the Byzantine Emperor furious, which led to the persecution of the Maronites by the Byzantines, and their consequent retreat into the mountains of Lebanon, where they would continue to reside until the French mandate after World War 1.

===Great schism===
Over the centuries, differences between the Church in the East and West emerged such as the use of unleavened bread for the Eucharist in the West or the addition of the filioque to the Nicene Creed by Pope Sergius IV. The resulting schism, the Great Schism, has often been dated to the 1054 mission of Cardinal Humbert to Constantinople when Humbert excommunicated (invalidly) the Patriach of Constantinople, Michael I Cerularius, who in turn excommunicated the Pope and removed him from the diptychs. Consequently, two major Christian bodies broke communion became two fractions: One faction, now identified as the Catholic Church, represented the Latin West under the leadership of the pope; the other faction, now identified as the Eastern Orthodox Church, represented the Greek East under the collegial authority of the patriarchs of Antioch, Jerusalem, Constantinople and Alexandria. This split, however, was then most likely known only within higher clerics who either gave it little importance or expected it to be overcome soon.

As with the patriarchates of Alexandria and Jerusalem, communication between Rome and Antioch was not as easy as between Rome and Constantinople. Nevertheless, documentation between Antioch and Rome exist such as when in 1052 Patriarch Peter III send news of his appointment to Leo IX and asked him to send a profession of faith back as the popes had not been commemorated in the diptychs for 30 years. After Michael I Cerularius had excommunicated the Latin Church in 1054, informed also Peter III whose reply shows the non-importance he and many others maintained toward the events of 1054; Peter maintained the Latins were their brothers but that their thinking was prone to error and that as barbarians they should be excused from a precise understanding of orthodoxy. In 1085, the city was captured by Sultanate of Rum but it was allowed that John the Oxite, the newly appointed patriarch by emperor Alexios I Komnenos could live in the city. When the army of the First Crusade appeared before the walls of Antioch, John was imprisoned by the city&#x27;s governor and subject to torture in front of the eyes of the crusaders. After the conquest of the city in June 1098, John was released and reinstated by the spiritual leader of the crusader, Adhemar of Le Puy, as patriarch of Antioch. After Adhemar&#x27;s death, the Norman Bohemond of Taranto established himself as prince of Antioch and went in opposition to Alexios I in 1099/1100, forcing John to leave the patriarchate due to his suspected loyalty to the Byzantine Emperor. Bohemond selected a Frankish cleric loyal to him as new patriarch, thus starting the Latin Patriarchate of Antioch.

The Western influence in the area was finally ended by the victories of the Muslim Mamluks over the Crusader States in the 13th century. In 1268 the Principality of Antioch came to an end with the brutal conquest of the city by Mamluks which left the significance of the patriarchate, together with the ecclesiastical schisms between Rome and Constantinople and between Constantinople and Alexandria and Antioch, isolated, fractured and debased. The Latin Patriarch went into exile in 1268, and the office became titular only. The office fell vacant in 1953 and was finally abolished in 1964.

===Melkite split of 1724===
In 1724, Cyril VI was elected Greek patriarch of Antioch. He was considered to be pro-Rome by the patriarch of Constantinople, who refused to recognize the election and appointed another patriarch in his stead. Many Melkites continued to acknowledge Cyril&#x27;s claim to the patriarchate. Thus from 1724 the Greek Church of Antioch split up in the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch and in the Melkite Greek Catholic Church. In 1729, Pope Benedict XIII recognized Cyril as the Eastern Catholic patriarch of Antioch and welcomed him and his followers into full communion with the Catholic Church.

== Current patriarchs ==
Today, five churches claim the title of patriarch of Antioch; three of these are autonomous Eastern Catholic particular churches in full communion with the pope of Rome. All five see themselves as part of the Antiochene heritage and claim a right to the Antiochene See through apostolic succession, although none are currently based in the city of Antakya. This multiplicity of Patriarchs of Antioch as well as their lack of location in Antioch, reflects the troubled history of Christianity in the region, which has been marked by internecine struggles and persecution, particularly since the Islamic conquest. Indeed, the Christian population in the original territories of the Antiochene patriarchs has been all but eliminated by assimilation and expulsion, with the region&#x27;s current Christians forming a small minority.

The current patriarchs of Antioch are listed below in order of their accession to the post, from earliest to most recent.
* Ignatius Aphrem II, Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch. He is the Supreme Head of the Syriac Orthodox Church, an Oriental Orthodox Church that uses the West Syriac Rite. His see is based in Damascus, Syria.
* John X of Antioch, Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch. He is the Supreme Head of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch, one of the four ancient patriarchates of the Eastern Orthodox Church that uses the Byzantine Rite. His see is based in Damascus, Syria.
*Ignatius Joseph III Yonan, Syriac Catholic Patriarch of Antioch. He is the Supreme Head of the Syriac Catholic Church, an Eastern Rite Catholic Church that is in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church and uses the West Syriac Rite. The see is based in Beirut, Lebanon.
* Bechara Boutros Rahi, Maronite Patriarch of Antioch. He is the Supreme Head of the Syriac Maronite Church an Eastern Rite Catholic Church that is in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church and uses the West Syriac Rite. His see is based in Bkerké, Lebanon.
* Youssef Absi, Melkite Catholic Patriarch of Antioch. He is the Supreme Head of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, an Eastern Rite Catholic Church that is in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church and uses the Byzantine Rite. His see is based in Damascus, Syria.

At one point, there was at least nominally a &quot;sixth&quot; claimant to the Patriarchate. When the Western European Crusaders established the Principality of Antioch, they established a Latin Church church in the city, whose head took the title of Patriarch. After the Crusaders were expelled by the Mamluks in 1268, the pope continued to appoint a titular Latin patriarch of Antioch, whose actual seat was the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. The last holder of this office was Roberto Vicentini, who died without a successor in 1953. The post itself was abolished in 1964.

==Episcopal succession==

One way to understand the historical interrelationships between the various churches is to examine their chain of episcopal succession—that is, the sequence of bishops that each church regards as having been the predecessors of each church&#x27;s current claimant to the patriarchate. There were four points in history where a disputed succession to the patriarchate led to a lasting institutional schism, leading to the five churches that exist today.

*All five churches recognize a single sequence of bishops until 518. In that year, Severus, who rejected the Council of Chalcedon, was deposed by the Byzantine Emperor Justin I and replaced by the Chalcedonian Paul the Jew, but Severus and his followers did not recognize his deposition. This led to two rival sequences of patriarchs: Severus and his successors, recognized by the two Syriac churches; and Paul and his successors, recognized by the Greek Orthodox, Melkite, and Maronite Churches. It was the successors of Paul who were recognized as legitimate by the Byzantine government.
*In 685, John Maron, who recognized the legitimacy of Paul the Jew and his successors until Byzantium began to appoint titular patriarchs of Antioch ending with Theophanes (681–687), was elected Patriarch of Antioch by the Maradite army. Byzantine Emperor Justinian II sent an army to dislodge John from the see; John and his followers retreated to Lebanon, where they formed the Maronite Church, whose succession of patriarchs have continued to the present day. The Byzantines appointed Theophanes of Antioch in his stead. Thus there were now three rival patriarchs: those that recognized Severus and his successors, those that recognized John Maron and his successors, and those that recognized Theophanes and his successors. It was the successors of Theophanes who were recognized as legitimate by the Byzantine government.
*In 1724, the church that recognized Theophanes and his successors elected Cyril VI Tanas, who supported re-establishing communion with the Catholic Church that had been broken in the Great Schism, as patriarch of Antioch. However, the ecumenical patriarch declared Cyril&#x27;s election invalid, and appointed Sylvester of Antioch in his stead. Cyril and Sylvester both had followers, and both continued to claim the patriarchate. The Melkite Greek Catholic Church recognizes Cyril and his successors; the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch recognizes Sylvester and his successors.
*In 1783, a faction within the church that recognized Severus and his successors elected Ignatius Michael III Jarweh, a bishop who was already in communion with the Catholic Church, as patriarch of Antioch. Shortly thereafter, another faction, who rejected communion with Rome, elected Ignatius Matthew. Both had followers, and both continued to claim the patriarchate. The Syriac Orthodox Church recognizes Ignatius Mathew and his successors; the Syriac Catholic Church recognizes Ignatius Michael and his successors.

Thus, the succession recognized by each church is as follows:

*The Syriac Orthodox Church recognizes the succession from the Apostle Peter to Severus, then recognizes Sergius of Tella as Severus&#x27;s successor in 544, then recognizes Sergius&#x27;s successors down to Ignatius George IV, then recognizes Ignatius Matthew as Ignatius George&#x27;s successor in 1783, then recognizes Ignatius Matthew&#x27;s successors down to Ignatius Aphrem II today.
*The Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch recognizes the succession from the Apostle Peter to Severus, then recognizes that Severus was deposed in favor of Paul the Jew in 519, then recognizes Paul the Jew&#x27;s successors down to Athanasius III Dabbas, then recognizes Sylvester of Antioch as Athanasius III&#x27;s successor in 1724, then recognizes Sylvester&#x27;s successors down to John X today.
*The Maronite Church recognizes the succession from the Apostle Peter to Severus, then recognizes that Severus was deposed in favor of Paul the Jew in 518, then recognizes Paul the Jew&#x27;s successors until Byzantium began appointing titular Patriarchs of Antioch ending with Theophanes (681–687), at which point they recognize the election of John Maron, then recognize John&#x27;s successors down to Bechara Boutros al-Rahi today.
*The Melkite Greek Catholic Church recognizes the succession from the Apostle Peter to Severus, then recognizes that Severus was deposed in favor of Paul the Jew in 518, then recognizes Paul the Jew&#x27;s successors down to Peter III, then recognizes Cyril VI Tanas as Peter III&#x27;s successor in 1724, then recognizes Cyril VI&#x27;s successors down to Youssef Absi today.
*The Syriac Catholic Church recognizes the succession from the Apostle Peter to Severus, then recognizes Ignatius Michael III Jarweh as Severus&#x27;s successor in 1783, then recognizes Ignatius Michael III&#x27;s successors down to Ignatius Joseph III Yonan today.

<doc id="273243" wikidata="Q28997" url="?curid=273243" title="Sled dog">
<text>A sled dog is a dog trained and used to pull a land vehicle in harness, most commonly a sled over snow.

Sled dogs have been used in the Arctic for at least 8,000 years and, along with watercraft, were the only transportation in Arctic areas until the introduction of semi-trailer trucks, snowmobiles and airplanes in the 20th century, hauling supplies in areas that were inaccessible by other methods. They were used with varying success in the explorations of both poles, as well as during the Alaskan gold rush. Sled dog teams delivered mail to rural communities in Alaska, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Sled dogs today are still used by some rural communities, especially in areas of Russia, Canada, and Alaska as well as much of Greenland. They are used for recreational purposes and racing events, such as the Iditarod Trail and the Yukon Quest.

==History==
Sled dogs are used in countries and regions such as Canada, Greenland, Siberia, Russia, Norway, Sweden, and Alaska.

===Russia===
A 2017 study showed that 9,000 years ago, the domestic dog was present at what is now Zhokhov Island, northeastern Siberia, which at that time was connected to the mainland. The dogs were selectively bred as either sled dogs or hunting dogs, implying that a sled dog standard and a hunting dog standard co-existed. The optimal maximum size for a sled dog is based on thermo-regulation, and the ancient sled dogs were between . The same standard has been found in the remains of sled dogs from this region 2,000 years ago and in the modern Siberian Husky breed standard. Other dogs were more massive at and appear to be dogs that had been crossed with wolves and used for polar bear hunting. At death, the heads of the dogs had been carefully separated from their bodies by humans. Anthropologists speculated that this might have been for ceremonial reasons.

The Kungur Chronicle and the Remezov Chronicle, created at the end of the 16th century and 1703 respectively, tells about the people living along Siberian rivers, whose primary means of transport was riding on reindeer or dogs. In these documents, the rivers Olenyok, Yana, Indigirka and Kolyma were called &quot;dog rivers&quot;, as they were rich in fish for the dogs to eat. Rivers with no fish or not enough to feed the dogs were called &quot;deer rivers,&quot; as reindeer were then used for transportation.

From the 1940s to the 1990s, Russian dog sled numbers were in decline. The breed population reached an all-time low of 3,000 in 1998 before revival efforts took off. Reasons for their decline include
* introduction of mechanization in the Arctic
* reduced capacity to keep dogs, especially with reduced fish catches and collectivization of farming and reindeer herding.
*decline of fur hunting.

=== Scandinavia ===

After World War II, skijor and pulka style dog sled racing gained rapidly in popularity in Norway and neighboring Scandinavian countries. These styles of racing required small, fast teams of 1–4 dogs who competed over short, hilly distances of . Required to use purebred dogs by the Norwegian Sled Dog Racing Association, the German Shorthair Pointer quickly emerged as the dog breed of choice. At the beginning of the 1970s, the &quot;sled pointer&quot; had emerged, a pointing dog who was bred exclusively for sledding and not hunting. During the 1970s, &quot;Nome-style&quot; sled racing, which mimicked the big sled dog teams running long distances and overnighting in subzero temperatures seen in North American-style races, started to attract interest in Scandinavia. In 1974, the first Nome-style sled race, the Skjelbreia Sweepstakes, was hosted near Oslo. For this style of racing, Norwegian mushers began to import Alaskan huskies; popularized by mushers like Stein Havard Fjelstad and Roger Leegaard who traveled to Alaska to race in the Iditarod. However, as a performance crossbreed, the Alaskan husky could not be legally raced in Norway until 1985, when the Norwegian Sled Dog Racing Association removed the requirement that sled dogs be purebred.

This new ruling also paved the way for Nordic-style mushers to breed their best performing dogs regardless of breed, with mushers mixing Alaskan husky and German Shorthair Pointer to produce the Eurohound as well as Greyhound with German Shorthair Pointer to produce the Greyster. These Nordic-style crossbreeds gained in popularity across Europe and later North America, especially with the rise in popularity of dryland mushing, such as bikejoring and canicross.

Sled dogs and husky safaris are not native to Sápmi (Lapland) and Finland and are considered a major nuisance by reindeer herders as they directly impact their livelihoods. These and glass-domed &quot;iglus&quot; have been appropriated from other cultures by the tourist industry in the 1980s and falsely portrayed as being part of the Sámi and Finnish cultures.

===Greenland===
The Greenlandic Inuit have a very long history of using sled dogs and they are still widely used today. As of 2010, some 18,000 Greenland dogs were kept in western Greenland north of the Arctic Circle and in eastern Greenland (because of the effort of maintaining the purity of this culturally important breed, they are the only dogs allowed in these regions) and about half of these were in active use as sled dogs by hunters and fishers. As a result of reduced sea ice (limiting their area of use), increasing use of snowmobiles, increasing dog food prices and disease among some local dog populations, the number has been gradually falling in decades and by 2016 there were 15,000 Greenland dogs. A number of projects have been initiated in an attempt of ensuring that Greenland&#x27;s dog sledding culture, knowledge and use are not lost.

The Sirius Patrol, a special forces unit in the Danish military, enforces the sovereignty of the remote unpopulated northeast (essentially equalling the Northeast Greenland National Park) and conduct long-range dog sled patrolling, which also record all sighted wildlife. The patrols averaged per year during 1978–1998. By 2011, the Greenland wolf had re-populated eastern Greenland from the National Park in the northeast through following these dog-sled patrols over distances of up to .

===North America===
In 2019, a study found that those dogs brought initially into the North American Arctic from northeastern Siberia were later replaced by dogs accompanying the Inuit during their expansion beginning 2,000 years ago. These Inuit dogs were more genetically diverse and more morphologically divergent when compared with the earlier dogs. Today, Arctic sledge dogs are the last descendants in the Americas of this pre-European dog lineage.
Historical references of the dogs and dog harnesses that were used by Native American cultures date back to before European contact. The use of dogs as draft animals was widespread in North America. There were two main kinds of sled dogs; one kind was kept by coastal cultures, and the other kind was kept by interior cultures such as the Athabascan Indians. These interior dogs formed the basis of the Alaskan husky. Russian traders following the Yukon River inland in the mid-1800s acquired sled dogs from the interior villages along the river. The dogs of this area were reputed to be stronger and better at hauling heavy loads than the native Russian sled dogs.
The Alaskan Gold Rush brought renewed interest in the use of sled dogs as transportation. Most gold camps were accessible only by dogsled in the winter. &quot;Everything that moved during the frozen season moved by dog team; prospectors, trappers, doctors, mail, commerce, trade, freighting of supplies … if it needed to move in winter, it was moved by sled dogs.&quot; This, along with the dogs&#x27; use in the exploration of the poles, led to the late 1800s and early 1900s being nicknamed the &quot;Era of the Sled Dog&quot;.
Sled dogs were used to deliver the mail in Alaska during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Alaskan Malamutes were the favored breed, with teams averaging eight to 10 dogs. Dogs were capable of delivering mail in conditions that would stop boats, trains, and horses. Each team hauled between of mail. The mail was stored in waterproofed bags to protect it from the snow. By 1901, dog trails had been established along the entirety of the Yukon River. Mail delivery by dog sled came to an end in 1963 when the last mail carrier to use a dog sled, Chester Noongwook of Savoonga, retired. He was honored by the US Postal Service in a ceremony on St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea.

Airplanes took over Alaskan mail delivery in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1924, Carl Ben Eielson flew the first Alaskan airmail delivery. Dog sleds were used to patrol western Alaska during World War II. Highways and trucking in the 40s and 50s, and the snowmobile in the 50s and 60s, contributed to the decline of the working sled dog.
Recreational mushing came into place to maintain the tradition of dog mushing. The desire for larger, stronger, load-pulling dogs changed to one for faster dogs with high endurance used in racing, which caused the dogs to become lighter than they were historically. Americans and others living in Alaska then began to import sled dogs from the native tribes of Siberia (which would later evolve and become the Siberian Husky breed) to increase the speed of their own dogs, presenting &quot;a direct contrast to the idea that Russian traders sought heavier draft-type sled dogs from the Interior regions of Alaska and the Yukon less than a century earlier to increase the hauling capacity of their lighter sled dogs.&quot;

Outside of Alaska, dog-drawn carts were used to haul peddler&#x27;s wares in cities like New York.

====Alaska and the Iditarod====
In 1925, a massive diphtheria outbreak crippled Nome, Alaska. There was no serum in Nome to treat the people infected by the disease. There was serum in Nenana, but the town was more than away, and inaccessible except by dog sled. A dog sled relay was set up by the villages between Nenana and Nome, and 20 teams worked together to relay the serum to Nome. The serum reached Nome in six days.

The Iditarod Trail was established on the path between these two towns. It was known as the Iditarod Trail because, at the time, Iditarod was the largest town on the trail. During the 1940s, the trail fell into disuse. However, in 1967, Dorothy Page, who was conducting Alaska&#x27;s centennial celebration, ordered of the trail to be cleared for a dog sled race. In 1972, the US Army performed a survey of the trail, and in 1973 the Iditarod was established by Joe Redington, Sr. The race was won by Dick Wilmarth, who took three weeks to complete the race.
The modern Iditarod is a endurance sled dog race. It usually lasts for ten to eleven days, weather permitting. It begins with a ceremonial start in Anchorage, Alaska on the morning of the first Saturday in March, with mushers running to Eagle River along the Alaskan Highway, giving spectators a chance to see the dogs and the mushers. The teams are then loaded onto trucks and driven to Wasilla for the official race start in the afternoon. The race ends when the last musher either drops out of the race or crosses the finish line in Nome. The winner of the race receives a prize of US$50,000. It has been billed as the &quot;World Series of mushing events&quot; and &quot;The Last Great Race on Earth&quot;.

===Antarctica===
The first Arctic explorers were men with sled dogs. Due to the success of using sled dogs in the Arctic, it was thought they would be helpful in the Antarctic exploration as well, and many explorers made attempts to use them. Sled dogs were used until 1992, when they were banned from Antarctica by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty as part of a larger ban on foreign species in order to protect the antarctic ecosystem.

Carsten Borchgrevink used either Sámi sled dogs or Samoyeds with Finnish handlers in Antarctica during his Southern Cross Expedition (1898–1900), but it was much colder than expected at Cape Adare. The dogs were used to working on snow, not on ice, in much milder temperatures. The dogs were also inadequately fed, and eventually all of the dogs died.

Erich von Drygalski used Kamchatka sled dogs in his 1901–1903 expedition, and fared much better because his dogs were used to the cold and he hired an experienced dog handler. His dogs were allowed to breed freely and many had to be shot because there was no room on the ship to take them home. Many that were not shot were left behind on the Kerguelen Islands.

Otto Nordenskjöld intended to use Greenland dogs in his 1901–1904 expedition, but all but four of his huskies died on the journey south. He picked up a mixed breed in the Falklands, but after his arrival in the Antarctic, these were all hunted down and killed by his four surviving huskies hunting as a pack because of dog handler Ole Jonassen&#x27;s failure to tether the dogs. These huskies were later able to pull over in three and a half hours.

Robert Falcon Scott brought twenty Samoyeds with him during his 1902 journey. The dogs struggled under the conditions Scott placed them in, with four dogs pulling heavily loaded sleds through of snow with bleeding feet. Scott blamed their failure on rotten dried fish. In 1910, Scott returned with 33 Sakhalin huskies but noted that they performed poorly in deep snow and their docked tails prevented them from curling up to keep warm.

Douglas Mawson and Xavier Mertz were part of the Far Eastern Party, a three-man sledging team with Lieutenant B.E.S. Ninnis, to survey King George V Land, Antarctica. On 14 December 1912, Ninnis fell through a snow-covered crevasse along with most of the party&#x27;s rations, and was never seen again. Their meagre provisions forced them to eat their remaining dogs on their return journey. Their meat was tough, stringy and without a vestige of fat. Each animal yielded very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs, which ate the meat, skin and bones until nothing remained.
The men also ate the dog&#x27;s brains and livers. Unfortunately eating the liver of sled dogs produces the condition hypervitaminosis A because canines have a much higher tolerance for vitamin A than humans do. Mertz suffered a quick deterioration. He developed stomach pains and became incapacitated and incoherent. On 7 January 1913, Mertz died. Mawson continued alone, eventually making it back to camp alive.

Roald Amundsen&#x27;s expedition was planned around 97 Esquimaux dogs (possibly Canadian Eskimo Dogs, Greenland Dogs or both). On his first try, two of his dogs froze to death in the temperatures. He tried a second time and was successful. Amundsen was covering a day, with stops every to build a cairn to mark the trail. He had 55 dogs with him, which he culled until he had 14 left when he returned from the pole. On the return trip, a man skied ahead of the dogs and hid meat in the cairns to encourage them to run.

== Sled dog breeds ==
The original sled dogs were chosen for size, strength and stamina, but modern dogs are bred for speed and endurance Most sled dogs weigh around , but they can weigh as little as , and can exceed . Sled dogs have a very efficient gait, and &quot;mushers strive for a well balanced dog team that matches all dogs for both size (approximately the same) and gait (the walking, trotting or running speeds of the dogs as well as the &#x27;transition speed&#x27; where a dog will switch from one gait to another) so that the entire dog team moves in a similar fashion which increases overall team efficiency.&quot; They can run up to . Because of this, sled dogs have very tough, webbed feet with closely spaced toes. Their webbed feet act as snow shoes.

Sled dog breeds can typically be divided into further sub-types:

* sprint dogs, bred to pull sleds quickly
* freight dogs, bred to pull massive weights
* long distance dogs, bred to travel hundreds or even thousands of miles
* aboriginal multipurpose sled dogs, such as Russian laikas who pull sleds as well as herd reindeer and hunt game.

A dog&#x27;s fur depends on its use. Freight dogs should have dense, warm coats to hold heat in, and sprint dogs have short coats that let heat out. Most sled dogs have a double coat, with the outer coat keeping snow away from the body, and a waterproof inner coat for insulation. In warm weather, dogs may have problems regulating their body temperature and may overheat. Their tails serve to protect their nose and feet from freezing when the dog is curled up to sleep. They also have a unique arrangement of blood vessels in their legs to help protect against frostbite.

Appetite is a big part of choosing sled dogs; picky dogs off trail may be pickier on the trail. They are fed high-fat diets, and on the trail may eat oily salmon or blubbery sea mammals. Sled dogs also must not be overly aggressive with other dogs. They also need a lot of exercise.

=== Breeds ===

==== Alaskan husky ====
The most commonly used dog in dog sled racing, the Alaskan husky is a mongrel bred specifically for its performance as a sled dog. There are two genetically distinct varieties of the Alaskan husky: a sprinting group and a long-distance group. Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian Huskies contributed the most genetically to the long-distance group, while English Pointers and Salukis contributed the most to the sprinting group. Anatolian Shepherd Dogs contributed a strong work ethic to both varieties. There are many Alaskan huskies that are part Greyhound, which improves their speed.

==== Alaskan Malamute ====
Alaskan Malamutes are large, strong freight dogs. They weigh between and have round faces with soft features. Freight dogs are a class of dogs that includes both pedigree and non-pedigree dogs. Alaskan Malamutes are thought to be one of the first domesticated breeds of dogs, originating in the Kotzebue Sound region of Alaska. These dogs are known for their broad chests, thick coats, and tough feet. Speed has little to no value for these dogs - instead, the emphasis is on pulling strength. They are used in expedition and long adventure trips, and for hauling heavy loads. Alaskan Malamutes were the dog of choice for hauling and messenger work in World War II.

====Canadian Eskimo Dog====
The Canadian Eskimo Dog or Canadian Inuit Dog, also known as the Exquimaux Husky, Esquimaux Dog, and &quot;Qimmiq&quot; (an Inuit language word for dog), has its origins in the aboriginal sled dogs used by the Thule people of Arctic Canada. The breed as it exists today was primarily developed through the work of the Canadian government. It is capable of pulling between per dog for distances between . The Canadian Eskimo Dog was also used as a hunting dog, helping Inuit hunters to catch seals, muskoxen, and polar bears. On 1 May 2000, the Canadian territory of Nunavut officially adopted the &quot;Canadian Inuit Dog&quot; as the animal symbol of the territory. They are considered genetically to be the same breed as the Greenland Dog, as research shows they have not yet diverged enough genetically to be considered separate breeds.

====Chinook====
The Chinook is a rare breed of sled dog developed in New Hampshire in the early 1900s by Arthur Walden, a gold rush adventurer and dog driver, and is a blend of English Mastiff, Greenland Dog, German Shepherd Dog, and Belgian Shepherd. It is the state dog of New Hampshire and was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in the Working Group in 2013. They are described as athletic and &quot;hard bodied&quot; with a &quot;tireless gait&quot;. Their coat colour is always tawny, ranging from a pale honey color to reddish-gold.

==== Chukotka Sled Dog ====
The Chukotka Sled Dog (чукотская ездовая) is the aboriginal spitz breed of dog indigenous to the Chukchi people of Russia. Chukotka sled dog teams have been used since prehistoric times to pull sleds in harsh conditions, such as hunting sea mammals on oceanic pack ice. Chukotka sled dogs are most famous as the progenitor of the Siberian husky.

==== Eurohound ====
A Eurohound is a type of dog bred for sprint-style sled dog racing. The Eurohound is typically crossbred from the Alaskan husky group and any of a number of pointing breeds (&quot;pointers&quot;).

====Greenland Dog====
Greenland Dogs are heavy dogs with high endurance but little speed. They are frequently used by people offering dog sled adventures and long expeditions. As of 2016, there were about 15,000 Greenland Dogs living in Greenland, but decades ago the number was significantly higher and projects have been initiated to ensure the survival of the breed. In many regions north of the Arctic Circle in Greenland, they are a primary mode of transportation in the winter. Most hunters in Greenland favour dog sled teams over snowmobiles, as the dog sled teams are more reliable. They are considered genetically to be the same breed as the Canadian Eskimo Dog, as research shows they have not yet diverged enough genetically to be considered separate breeds.

====Greyster====
The Greyster is a type of sled dog bred for sled dog racing, especially dryland sports like canicross and bikejoring. The Greyster is crossbred from the Greyhound and the German Shorthair Pointer.

====Kamchatka Sled Dog====

The Kamchatka Sled Dog (Russian: Камчатских ездовых собак, literally &quot;Kamchatka riding dog&quot;) is a rare landrace of sled laika developed by the Itelmen and Koryak people of Kamchatka, Russia.
There are currently efforts underway to revive the breed.

====Labrador Husky====

The Labrador Husky originated in the Labrador portion of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The breed probably arrived in the area with the Inuit who came to Canada around 1300 AD. Despite the name, Labrador huskies are not related to the Labrador retriever, but in fact most closely related the Canadian Eskimo Dog. There are estimated to be 50–60 Labrador huskies in the world.

====MacKenzie River Husky====
The term Mackenzie River husky describes several overlapping local populations of Arctic and sub-Arctic sled dog-type dogs, none of which constitutes a breed. Dogs from Yukon were crossed with large European breeds such as St. Bernards and Newfoundlands to create a powerful freighting dog capable of surviving harsh Arctic conditions.

====Samoyed====
The Samoyed is a laika developed by the Samoyede people of Siberia, who used them to herd reindeer and hunt, in addition to hauling sleds. These dogs were so prized, and the people who owned them so dependent upon them for survival, that the dogs were allowed to sleep in the tents with their owners. Samoyeds weigh about for males and for females and stands from at the shoulder.

====Sakhalin Husky====

The Sakhalin Husky, also known as the Karafuto Ken (樺太犬), is a breed of sled dog developed on the island of Sakhalin. Sakhalin huskies are prized for their hardiness, great temperaments and easy trainability, even being the preferred dog used by the Soviet army for hauling gear in harsh condition prior to World War II. Unfortunately with the advent of mechanized travel, Soviet officials determined that the cost of maintaining Sakhalins was wasteful and exterminated them, with only a handful residing in Japan surviving. There are approximately 20 Sakhalin Huskies remaining on Sakhalin Island.

==== Siberian Husky ====
Smaller than the similar-appearing Alaskan Malamute, the Siberian Husky pulls more, pound for pound, than a Malamute. Descendants of the sled dogs bred and used by the native Chukchi people of Siberia which were imported to Alaska in the early 1900s, they were used as working dogs and racing sled dogs in Nome, Alaska throughout the 1910s, often dominating the All-Alaska Sweepstakes. They later became widely bred by recreational mushers and show-dog fanciers in the United States and Canada as the Siberian Husky, after the popularity garnered from the 1925 serum run to Nome. Siberians stand , weigh between ( for females, for males), and have been selectively bred for both appearance and pulling ability. They are still used regularly today as sled dogs by competitive, recreational, and tour-guide mushers.

==== Yakutian Laika ====
The Yakutian Laika (Russian: Якутская лайка) is an ancient working dog breed that originated in the Arctic seashore of the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic. In terms of functionality, Yakutian Laikas are a sled laika, being able to herd, hunt, and as well as haul freight. The Yakutian Laika is recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) and the AKC&#x27;s Foundation Stock Service. The Yakutian Laika is a medium size, strong and compact dog, with powerful muscles and thick double coat to handle bitter Arctic temperatures. They were the preferred dog of Russian polar explorer Georgy Ushakov, who prized them for their hardiness and versatility, being able to hunt seals and polar bears as well as haul sleds for thousands of miles.

===Other breeds===
Numerous non-sled dog breeds have been used as sled dogs. Poodles, Irish Setters, German Shorthaired Pointers, Labrador Retrievers, golden retriever, Newfoundlands, Chow Chows and St. Bernards have all been used to pull sleds in the past.

==World Championships==
FSS held the first World Championships in Saint Moritz, Switzerland in 1990 with classes in only Sled Sprint (10-Dog, 8-Dog, and 6-Dog) and Skidog Pulka for men and women. 113 competitors arrived in the starting chutes to mark the momentous occasion. At first World Championships were held each year, but after the 1995 events, it was decided to hold them every two years, which facilitated the bidding process and enabled the host organization more time for preparation.

==Famous sled dogs==

===Balto===
Balto was the lead dog of the sled dog team that carried the diphtheria serum on the last leg of the relay to Nome during the 1925 diphtheria epidemic. He was driven by musher Gunnar Kaasen, who worked for Leonhard Seppala. Seppala had also bred Balto.

In 1925, 10 months after Balto completed his run, a bronze statue was erected in his honour in Central Park near the Tisch Children&#x27;s Zoo. The statue was sculpted by Frederick George Richard Roth. Children frequently climb the statue to pretend to ride on the dog. The plaque at the base of the statue reads &quot;Endurance · Fidelity · Intelligence&quot;. Balto&#x27;s body was stuffed following his death in 1933, and is on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.

In 1995, a Universal Pictures animated movie based loosely on him, &quot;Balto&quot;, was released.

===Togo===

Togo was the lead sled dog of Leonhard Seppala and his dog sled team in the 1925 serum run to Nome across central and northern Alaska. Seppala considered Togo to be the greatest sled dog and lead dog of his mushing career, and of that age in Alaska, stating in 1960: &quot;I never had a better dog than Togo. His stamina, loyalty and intelligence could not be improved upon. Togo was the best dog that ever traveled the Alaska trail.&quot;

Katy Steinmetz in Time Magazine named Togo the most heroic animal of all time, writing that &quot;the dog that often gets credit for eventually saving the town is Balto, but he just happened to run the last, 55-mile leg in the race. The sled dog who did the lion&#x27;s share of the work was Togo. His journey, fraught with white-out storms, was the longest by 200 miles and included a traverse across perilous Norton Sound — where he saved his team and driver in a courageous swim through ice floes.&quot;

Togo would go on to become one of the foundation dogs for lines of Siberian sled dogs, and including eventually the Siberian Husky registered breed.

In 2019, Walt Disney Pictures released &quot;Togo,&quot; a film starring Willelm Dafoe as Leonard Seppala.

=== Taro and Jiro ===
In 1958, an ill-fated Japanese research expedition to Antarctica made an emergency evacuation, leaving behind 15 sled dogs. The researchers believed that a relief team would arrive within a few days, so they left the dogs chained up outside with a small supply of food; however, the weather turned bad and the team never made it to the outpost. One year later, a new expedition arrived and discovered that two of the dogs, Taro and Jiro, had survived. The breed spiked in popularity upon the release of the 1983 film &quot;Nankyoku Monogatari&quot;. A second film from 2006, &quot;Eight Below&quot;, provided a fictional version of the occurrence, but did not reference the breed. Instead, the film features only eight dogs: two Alaskan Malamutes, and six Siberian Huskies.

===Other dogs===
Anna was a small sled dog who ran on Pam Flower&#x27;s team during her expedition to become the first woman to cross the Arctic alone. She was noted for being the smallest dog to run on the team, and a picture book was created about her journey in the Arctic.

There are numerous stories of blind sled dogs that continue to run, either on their own or with assistance from other dogs on the team.

<text>Rhizobia are diazotrophic bacteria that fix nitrogen after becoming established inside the root nodules of legumes (Fabaceae). To express genes for nitrogen fixation, rhizobia require a plant host; they cannot independently fix nitrogen. In general, they are gram negative, motile, non-sporulating rods.

Rhizobia are a &quot;group of soil bacteria that infect the roots of legumes to form root nodules&quot;. Rhizobia are found in the soil and, after infection, produce nodules in the legume where they fix nitrogen gas (N2) from the atmosphere, turning it into a more readily useful form of nitrogen. From here, the nitrogen is exported from the nodules and used for growth in the legume. Once the legume dies, the nodule breaks down and releases the rhizobia back into the soil, where they can live individually or reinfect a new legume host.

== History ==
The first known species of rhizobia, &quot;Rhizobium leguminosarum&quot;, was identified in 1889, and all further species were initially placed in the &quot;Rhizobium&quot; genus. Most research has been done on crop and forage legumes such as clover, alfalfa, beans, peas, and soybeans; more research is being done on North American legumes.

== Taxonomy ==

Rhizobia are a paraphyletic group that fall into two classes of Pseudomonadota—the alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria. As shown below, most belong to the order Hyphomicrobiales, but several rhizobia occur in distinct bacterial orders of the Pseudomonadota.

These groups include a variety of non-symbiotic bacteria. For instance, the plant pathogen &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; is a closer relative of &quot;Rhizobium&quot; than the &quot;Bradyrhizobium&quot; that nodulate soybean.

== Importance in agriculture ==

Although much of the nitrogen is removed when protein-rich grain or hay is harvested, significant amounts can remain in the soil for future crops. This is especially important when nitrogen fertilizer is not used, as in organic rotation schemes or in some less-industrialized countries. Nitrogen is the most commonly deficient nutrient in many soils around the world and it is the most commonly supplied plant nutrient. The supply of nitrogen through fertilizers has severe environmental concerns.

Specific strains of rhizobia are required to make functional nodules on the roots able to fix the N2. Having this specific rhizobia present is beneficial to the legume, as the N2 fixation can increase crop yield. Inoculation with rhizobia tends to increase yield. Rhizobia has been found to increase legume resistance to insect herbivores, particularly when several species of rhizobia are present.

Legume inoculation has been an agricultural practice for many years and has continuously improved over time. 12–20 million hectares of soybeans are inoculated annually. An ideal inoculant includes some of the following aspects; maximum efficacy, ease of use, compatibility, high rhizobial concentration, long shelf-life, usefulness under varying field conditions, and survivability.

These inoculants may foster success in legume cultivation. As a result of the nodulation process, after the harvest of the crop, there are higher levels of soil nitrate, which can then be used by the next crop.

== Symbiotic relationship ==
Rhizobia are unique in that they are the only nitrogen-fixing bacteria living in a symbiotic relationship with legumes. Common crop and forage legumes are peas, beans, clover, and soy.

===Nature of the mutualism===
The legume–rhizobium symbiosis is a classic example of mutualism—rhizobia supply ammonia or amino acids to the plant and, in return, receive organic acids (mainly malate and succinate, which are dicarboxylic acids) as a carbon and energy source. However, because several unrelated strains infect each individual plant, a classic tragedy of the commons scenario presents itself. Cheater strains may hoard plant resources such as polyhydroxybutyrate for the benefit of their own reproduction without fixing an appreciable amount of nitrogen. Given the costs involved in nodulation and the opportunity for rhizobia to cheat, it may be surprising that this symbiosis exists.

===Infection and signal exchange===

The formation of the symbiotic relationship involves a signal exchange between both partners that leads to mutual recognition and the development of symbiotic structures. The most well understood mechanism for the establishment of this symbiosis is through intracellular infection. Rhizobia are free living in the soil until they are able to sense flavonoids, derivatives of 2-phenyl-1.4-benzopyrone, which are secreted by the roots of their host plant, triggering the accumulation of a large population of cells and eventually attachment to root hairs. These flavonoids then promote the DNA binding activity of NodD, which belongs to the LysR family of transcriptional regulators and triggers the secretion of nod factors after the bacteria have entered the root hair. Nod factors trigger a series of complex developmental changes inside the root hair, beginning with root hair curling and followed by the formation of the infection thread, a cellulose lined tube that the bacteria use to travel down through the root hair into the root cells. The bacteria then infect several other adjacent root cells. This is followed by continuous cell proliferation, resulting in the formation of the root nodule. A second mechanism, used especially by rhizobia that infect aquatic hosts, is called crack entry. In this case, no root hair deformation is observed. Instead, the bacteria penetrate between cells through cracks produced by lateral root emergence.

Inside the nodule, the bacteria differentiate morphologically into bacteroids and fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium using the enzyme nitrogenase. Ammonium is then converted into amino acids like glutamine and asparagine before it is exported to the plant. In return, the plant supplies the bacteria with carbohydrates in the form of organic acids. The plant also provides the bacteroid oxygen for cellular respiration, tightly bound by leghaemoglobins, plant proteins similar to human hemoglobins. This process keeps the nodule oxygen poor in order to prevent the inhibition of nitrogenase activity.

Recently, a &quot;Bradyrhizobium&quot; strain was discovered to form nodules in &quot;Aeschynomene&quot; without producing nod factors, suggesting the existence of alternative communication signals other than nod factors, possibly involving the secretion of the plant hormone cytokinin.

It has been observed that root nodules can be formed spontaneously in &quot;Medicago&quot; without the presence of rhizobia. This implies that the development of the nodule is controlled entirely by the plant and simply triggered by the secretion of nod factors.

===Evolutionary hypotheses===
====The sanctions hypothesis====
There are two main hypotheses for the mechanism that maintains legume-rhizobium symbiosis (though both may occur in nature). The sanctions hypothesis theorizes that legumes cannot recognize the more parasitic or less nitrogen fixing rhizobia and must counter the parasitism by post-infection legume sanctions. In response to underperforming rhizobia, legume hosts can respond by imposing sanctions of varying severity to their nodules.
These sanctions include, but are not limited to, reduction of nodule growth, early nodule death, decreased carbon supply to nodules, or reduced oxygen supply to nodules that fix less nitrogen. Within a nodule, some of the bacteria differentiate into nitrogen fixing bacteroids, which have been found to be unable to reproduce. Therefore, with the development of a symbiotic relationship, if the host sanctions hypothesis is correct, the host sanctions must act toward whole nodules rather than individual bacteria because individual targeting sanctions would prevent any reproducing rhizobia from proliferating over time. This ability to reinforce a mutual relationship with host sanctions pushes the relationship toward mutualism rather than parasitism and is likely a contributing factor to why the symbiosis exists.

However, other studies have found no evidence of plant sanctions.

====The partner choice hypothesis====
The partner choice hypothesis proposes that the plant uses prenodulation signals from the rhizobia to decide whether to allow nodulation, and chooses only noncheating rhizobia. There is evidence for sanctions in soybean plants, which reduce rhizobium reproduction (perhaps by limiting oxygen supply) in nodules that fix less nitrogen. Likewise, wild lupine plants allocate fewer resources to nodules containing less-beneficial rhizobia, limiting rhizobial reproduction inside. This is consistent with the definition of sanctions, although called &quot;partner choice&quot; by the authors. Some studies support the partner choice hypothesis. While both mechanisms no doubt contribute significantly to maintaining rhizobial cooperation, they do not in themselves fully explain the persistence of mutualism. The partner choice hypothesis is not exclusive from the host sanctions hypothesis, as it is apparent that both of them are prevalent in the symbiotic relationship.

===Evolutionary history===
The symbiosis between nitrogen fixing rhizobia and the legume family has emerged and evolved over the past 66 million years. Although evolution tends to swing toward one species taking advantage of another in the form of noncooperation in the selfish-gene model, management of such symbiosis allows for the continuation of cooperation. When the relative fitness of both species is increased, natural selection will favor symbiosis.

To understand the evolutionary history of this symbiosis, it is helpful to compare the rhizobia-legume symbiosis to a more ancient symbiotic relationship, such as that between endomycorrhizae fungi and land plants, which dates back to almost 460 million years ago.

Endomycorrhizal symbiosis can provide many insights into rhizobia symbiosis because recent genetic studies have suggested that rhizobia co-opted the signaling pathways from the more ancient endomycorrhizal symbiosis. Bacteria secrete Nod factors and endomycorrhizae secrete Myc-LCOs. Upon recognition of the Nod factor/Myc-LCO, the plant proceeds to induce a variety of intracellular responses to prepare for the symbiosis.

It is likely that rhizobia co-opted the features already in place for endomycorrhizal symbiosis because there are many shared or similar genes involved in the two processes. For example, the plant recognition gene SYMRK (symbiosis receptor-like kinase) is involved in the perception of both the rhizobial Nod factors as well as the endomycorrhizal Myc-LCOs. The shared similar processes would have greatly facilitated the evolution of rhizobial symbiosis because not all the symbiotic mechanisms would have needed to develop. Instead, the rhizobia simply needed to evolve mechanisms to take advantage of the symbiotic signaling processes already in place from endomycorrhizal symbiosis.

== Ecology ==

=== Effects of Rhizobia on Legume Host Characteristics ===

When associating with rhizobia, legumes often experience growth benefits and increased resistance to stress. Rhizobia&#x27;s ability to convert inorganic atmospheric nitrogen into an organic ammonia compounds provides leguminous plants access to a resource that many plants are limited by, increasing their fitness and the biodiversity of their ecosystems.

These growth benefits include increased overall plant growth, greater above and below ground biomass, increased shoot biomass, increased leaf protein levels, and more attractive floral traits for pollinators. Rhizobia has also been shown to increase legume resistance to insect herbivores when rhizobia diversity is high, specifically by increasing expression of defensive traits that reduce leaf herbivory and the number of sap-sucking aphids.

=== Effects of Mutualism on other Species ===
Other species that engage symbiotically with legumes are affected by legume-rhizobia mutualism. Legumes associating with rhizobia sometimes produce less ant attracting-extrafloral nectar, leading to a reduction in ants present and providing defensive benefits. Legumes hosting rhizobia have been observed receiving more pollinator visitations, despite not always increasing production of inflorescences. The presence of rhizobia increases the colonization rate of legume cells by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, increasing the quantity of soil nutrients available to the legume.
=== Context-Dependency of Mutualism ===
The legume-rhizobia mutualism is context dependent; the benefits provided by rhizobia are lessened or absent under unfavorable environmental conditions. Perturbations can alter the balance of symbiotic relationships between species as reduced benefits provided can lead to antagonistic behavior, such as parasitism.

These disruptions lead plant species to lessen their investment in the relationships, and perhaps even stop engaging in them altogether. For example, nutrient deposition has led to the emergence of less productive strains of rhizobia and increased ambient temperatures have legumes reducing investment in the resource mutualism. Nutrient deposition is of particular issue to legumes as the increased availability of nitrogen allows nitrogen-limited plant species to quickly out compete legumes for light. This increases photosynthesis costs, further destabilizing the legume-rhizobia mutualism as the legume suffers fitness consequences and is unable to provide benefits to rhizobia.

== Other diazotrophs ==
Many other species of bacteria are able to fix nitrogen (diazotrophs), but few are able to associate intimately with plants and colonize specific structures like legume nodules. Bacteria that do associate with plants include the actinomycete, &quot;Frankia&quot;, which form symbiotic root nodules in actinorhizal plants, although these bacteria have a much broader host range, implying the association is less specific than in legumes. Additionally, several cyanobacteria like &quot;Nostoc&quot; are associated with aquatic ferns, &quot;Cycas&quot;, and &quot;Gunneras,&quot; although they do not form nodules.

Additionally, loosely associated plant bacteria, termed endophytes, have been reported to fix nitrogen &quot;in planta&quot;. These bacteria colonize the intercellular spaces of leaves, stems, and roots in plants but do not form specialized structures like rhizobia and &quot;Frankia.&quot; Diazotrophic bacterial endophytes have very broad host ranges, in some cases colonizing both monocots and dicots.

<text>Trajan&#x27;s Column (, ) is a Roman triumphal column in Rome, Italy, that commemorates Roman emperor Trajan&#x27;s victory in the Dacian Wars. It was probably constructed under the supervision of the architect Apollodorus of Damascus at the order of the Roman Senate. It is located in Trajan&#x27;s Forum, north of the Roman Forum. Completed in AD 113, the freestanding column is most famous for its spiral bas relief, which depicts the wars between the Romans and Dacians (101–102 and 105–106). Its design has inspired numerous victory columns, both ancient and modern.

The structure is about in height, including its large pedestal. The shaft is made from a series of 20 colossal Carrara marble drums, each weighing about 32 tons, with a diameter of . The frieze winds around the shaft 23 times. Inside the shaft, a spiral staircase of 185 steps provides access to a viewing deck at the top. The capital block of Trajan&#x27;s Column weighs 53.3 tons, and had to be lifted to a height of about . Ancient coins indicate preliminary plans to top the column with a statue of a bird, probably an eagle. After construction, a statue of Trajan was put in place; this disappeared in the Middle Ages. On December 4, 1587, the top was crowned with a bronze figure of Saint Peter the Apostle by Pope Sixtus V, which remains to this day.

Trajan&#x27;s Column was originally flanked by two sections of the Ulpian Library, a Greek chamber and a Latin chamber, which faced each other and had walls lined with niches and wooden bookcases for scrolls. The Latin chamber likely contained Trajan&#x27;s commentary on the Roman-Dacian Wars, the &quot;Dacica&quot;, which most scholars agree was intended to be echoed in the spiralling, sculpted narrative design of Trajan&#x27;s Column.

== Frieze ==

===Design===
The column shows 2,662 figures and 155 scenes; Trajan himself appears on the column 58 times.

The continuous helical frieze winds 23 times from base to capital and was an architectural innovation in its time. The design was adopted by later emperors such as Marcus Aurelius. The narrative band expands from about at the base of the column to at the top. 
The scenes unfold continuously. Often a variety of different perspectives are used in the same scene, so that more can be revealed (&quot;e.g.&quot;, a different angle is used to show men working behind a wall).

=== Historical content portrayed ===

The relief portrays Trajan&#x27;s two victorious military campaigns against the Dacians; the lower half illustrating the first (101–102), and the top half illustrating the second (105–106). These campaigns were contemporary to the time of the column&#x27;s construction. The frieze repeats standardized scenes of imperial address (&quot;adlocutio&quot;), sacrifice (&quot;lustratio&quot;), and the army setting out on campaign (&quot;profectio&quot;). Scenes of battle are very much a minority on the column; instead it emphasizes images of orderly soldiers carrying out ceremony and construction. The aim of the Dacian campaigns was to incorporate and integrate Dacia into the Roman Empire as a province. On Trajan&#x27;s Column, imagery related to wartime violence in general seems to have been downplayed and depictions of violent action towards foreign women and children are nonexistent. Some scholars suggest the lack of battle scenes and large number of construction scenes was meant to speak to the urban population of Rome (the primary audience), addressing their fear and distrust of the army by depicting its warfare as one with little collateral damage. The portrayal of the Roman army as relatively gentle may have been designed to support Trajan&#x27;s image as a man of &quot;justice, clemency, moderation, and restraint&quot;. Others have argued that the number of tree-felling scenes on the Column (48 of the 224 trees on the Column are being felled) work alongside the bridging of the Danube at the base, and are meant to speak to a more total conquest of the province than had previously been achieved. Key specific events portrayed are the first crossing of the Danube by the Roman legion, Trajan&#x27;s voyage up the Danube, the surrender of the Dacians at the close of the first war, the great sacrifice by the Danube bridge during the second war, the assault on the Dacian capital, and the death of the Dacian king Decebalus. The two sections are separated by a personification of victory writing on a shield flanked on either side by trophies.

Great care was taken to distinguish the men and women from both sides of the campaign as well as the ranks within these distinct groups. The scenes are crowded with sailors, soldiers, statesmen and priests, showing about 2,500 figures in all. It also exists as a valuable source of information on Roman and barbarian arms and methods of warfare (such as forts, ships, weapons, etc.) and costume. The relief shows details such as a ballista or catapult. This detail is evident in the variety of trees on the Column, each individually stylised following 37 types, which has led some scholars to identify particular species. The precise details create a strong effect of verisimilitude; the designer presents the images as objective historical truth. The emperor Trajan is depicted realistically in the veristic style, making 58 appearances as the central hero among his troops.

Women for the most part occupy and define the margins of the scenes. However, mortal females in Roman state art are so rare it is remarkable that they are included at all in a war monument. In the male discourse of warfare, women are a visual trope that develops further the idea of subjugation by feminizing the foreign conquered. However, on the column is &quot;one of the most unusual, disturbing, and violent depictions of women in Roman art, the torture scene.&quot; In this unusual scene, four Dacian women are depicted torturing two naked men.

==Setting==

Today, Trajan&#x27;s Column is the most prominent architectural feature of Trajan&#x27;s Forum, left nearly intact but now isolated from its original setting. The column was placed toward the northernmost point of the forum, acting as the focal point of the entire forum complex. It was surrounded on three sides by two flanking libraries and the Basilica Ulpia. The two libraries to the northeast and southwest of the column were for the study of scrolls written in Latin and in Greek. These libraries were built in tandem with the column. They apparently included upper level viewing platforms for two sides of the column. By having an elevated vantage point, the figures of the scenes, carved in shallow relief and detailed with paint and metal fittings, could be seen more closely (nevertheless it remained impossible for the ancient viewer to follow sequentially the continuous spiral of the reliefs). The problem with visibility of the upper areas is further apparent when we compare Trajan&#x27;s Column to the Column of Marcus Aurelius. The figures in the later Column of Marcus Aurelius are more deeply cut and even simplified over the height of the shaft because there were no surrounding buildings to serve as viewing platforms. The different carving style seems to have been adopted to enhance visibility.

The two libraries flanking the column helped to further the emperor&#x27;s program of propaganda. In addition to serving as viewing platforms for the column, they housed valuable works of literature for the people of Rome. Surely one important text kept here was Trajan&#x27;s own account of the Dacian Wars, now lost. The reliefs on the column documenting the Dacian campaigns would have provided a vivid complement to Trajan&#x27;s account of the wars. The people of Rome were reminded of his victories every time they enjoyed the open space and amenities of the forum. The combination of the column and the magnificent buildings that surrounded it would have created an awe-inspiring spectacle.

== Purpose ==
It is unclear whether the column was meant to serve a commemorative function, as political propaganda, or both. Traditional scholarship held that the column was a glorifying monument, upholding Trajan as Rome&#x27;s great emperor. However, recent reconstructions of Trajan&#x27;s Forum have determined that any wide view of the column would have been mostly obstructed by two libraries in the Forum which tightly bookended it. Also, because it would have been difficult to follow the spiral frieze from end to end (walking in circles with head inclined), the column&#x27;s narrative power would have been fairly limited.

On the other hand, as French archaeologist Paul Veyne notes, the relief could be read &quot;vertically&quot; from below, with the figure of the emperor recognizable across the bands of images—just as, on the Colonne Vendôme, Napoleon&#x27;s figure can be picked up, scene after scene. Additionally, the two libraries surrounding it provided platforms from which to observe the column if the viewer stood on the top floors, making the complete view of frieze much more visible.
While there is certainly evidence that the Trajan&#x27;s Column was not put in an ideal spot for visibility, it is impossible to reject the column as some form of a glorification structure. There is the significant point that the column was extremely challenging to construct, so it is unlikely that it would have been placed in the Forum with the intentions of being hidden or out of plain sight.

There is also the important idea of the column as a symbol for Trajan. Trajan&#x27;s ashes were buried in a chamber at the base of the column. At the top of the column was a statue of Trajan. The ground level of the Forum, which is a center of life for Romans, is where the earthly remains of Trajan are buried. The narrative on Trajan&#x27;s Column unfurls from the base going up, taking a viewer through Trajan&#x27;s triumph in the Dacian wars and (as originally constructed) finishes with a statue of Trajan above the forum. Considering the practice of deification of emperors which was expected during this time period, especially of glorious Trajan, the symbolism may be interpreted as Trajan&#x27;s earthly remains staying in the Forum with the Roman people while his conquests ascend him up into the heavens.

After Trajan&#x27;s death in 117, the Roman Senate voted to have Trajan&#x27;s ashes buried in the column&#x27;s square base, which is decorated with captured Dacian arms and armor. His ashes and those of his wife, Plotina, were set inside the base in golden urns (which later disappeared from the monument). One reading of this is that Trajan may have intended the column to be his final resting place from the project&#x27;s inception, and that the similarities in design to other funerary structures made it a natural choice for the Roman Senate. In particular, the circumambulation demanded of onlookers of the column&#x27;s frieze is evocative of Roman funerary practice, drawing attention toward the center – and consequently, the finial of Trajan.

== Inscription ==

The inscription at the base of the column reads:

Translated to English:
It was believed that the column was supposed to stand where the saddle between the Capitoline and Quirinal Hills used to be, having been excavated by Trajan, but excavation has revealed that this is not the case. The saddle was where Trajan&#x27;s Forum and Trajan&#x27;s Market stood. Hence, the inscription refers to the Trajan&#x27;s entire building project in the area of the Imperial fora.

This is perhaps the most famous example of Roman square capitals, a script often used for stone monuments and, less often, for manuscript writing. As it was meant to be read from below, the bottom letters are slightly smaller than the top letters, to give proper perspective. Some, but not all, word divisions are marked with a dot, and many of the words, especially the titles, are abbreviated. In the inscription, numerals are marked with a &quot;titulus&quot;, a bar across the top of the letters. A small piece at the bottom of the inscription has been lost.

The typeface Trajan, designed in 1989 by Carol Twombly, uses letter forms based on this inscription, working from the research of Edward Catich. There have been many other typefaces based on the inscription from such designers as Frederic Goudy and Warren Chappell.

== Spiral stair ==

The interior of Trajan&#x27;s Column is hollow: entered by a small doorway at one side of the base, a spiral stair of 185 steps gives access to the platform above, having offered the visitor in antiquity a view over the surrounding Trajan&#x27;s forum; 43 window slits illuminate the ascent.

The column stands high from the ground to the top of the statue base: Located immediately next to the large Basilica Ulpia, it had to be constructed sufficiently tall in order to function as a vantage point and to maintain its own visual impact on the forum. The column proper, that is the shaft without the pedestal, the statue and its base, is high, a number which almost corresponds to 100 Roman feet; beginning slightly above the bottom of the base, the helical staircase inside measures a mere less.

The column is composed of 29 blocks of Luni marble, weighing in total more than 1100 t. The spiral stair itself was carved out of 19 blocks, with a full turn every 14 steps; this arrangement required a more complex geometry than the more usual alternatives of 12 or 16. The quality of the craftsmanship was such that the staircase is practically even, and the joints between the huge blocks still fit accurately. Despite numerous earthquakes in the past, the column today leans at an angle of less than half a degree.

Trajan&#x27;s Column, especially its helical stairway design, exerted a considerable influence on subsequent Roman architecture. While spiral stairs were before still a rare sight in Roman buildings, this space-saving form henceforth spread gradually throughout the empire. Apart from the practical advantages it offered, the design also became closely associated with imperial power, being later adopted by Trajan&#x27;s successors Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. In Napoleon&#x27;s time, a similar column decorated with a spiral of relief sculpture was erected in the Place Vendôme in Paris to commemorate his victory at Austerlitz.

== Construction ==

It is assumed that the column drums were lifted by cranes into their place. Ancient sources, as well as a substantial body of archaeological evidence, show that Roman engineers were capable of raising large weights clear off the ground. The typical drum of Trajan&#x27;s Column weighs c. 32 t, while the capital, the heaviest block above the base and pedestal, is even at 53.3 t, which had to be lifted high. To save weight, the treads had probably been carved out before either at the quarry or &quot;in situ&quot;.

Even so, for such loads, the typical Roman treadwheel crane, which could only reach a maximum height of in any event, was clearly inadequate. Instead, a tower-like wooden construction was erected around the building site, in the midst of which the marble blocks were raised by a system of pulleys, ropes and capstans; these were powered by a large workforce of men and possibly also draught animals, spread out on the ground. According to modern calculations, eight capstans were needed to hoist the 55 t base block, while the length of rope required for the highest drums measured some assuming two-block pulleys.

Such a lifting tower was later also used to great effect by the Renaissance architect Domenico Fontana to relocate obelisks in Rome. From his report, it becomes obvious that the coordination of the lift between the various pulling teams required a considerable amount of concentration and discipline, since, if the force was not applied evenly, the excessive stress on the ropes would make them rupture. In case of Trajan&#x27;s Column, the difficulties were exacerbated even further by the simultaneous work on the neighbouring Basilica Ulpia, which limited the available space so that the capstan crews had proper access only from one side.

== Reproduction ==
Plaster casts of the relief were taken in the 19th and 20th centuries. After a century of acid pollution, they are now more legible in some details than the original, and the way they are displayed offers students a closer look at the reliefs than at the original site. Examples can be studied at:

* Museum of Roman Civilization in Rome, where each &quot;frame&quot; of the narrative has been cut into a separate section and the sections are then displayed horizontally in order
* National Museum of Romanian History, Bucharest, Romania, which displays the frieze horizontally in segments
* Cast Courts at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Displayed in column form and, including the base, the column is chopped into two halves.

Additionally, individual casts of the frieze are on display in various museums, for example, in the Museum for Ancient Navigation in Mainz. A complete survey in monochrome was published by the German archaeologist Conrad Cichorius between 1896 and 1900 (see ), still forming the base of modern scholarship. Based on Cichorius&#x27;s work, and on the photographic archive of the German Archaeological Institute, a research-oriented Web-based viewer for Trajan&#x27;s Column was created at the German-language image database.

<text>The Patriarch of Alexandria (also known as the Bishop of Alexandria or [[Pope (word)|Pope]] of Alexandria) is the highest-ranking bishop of Egypt. The Patriarchs trace back their lineage to Mark the Evangelist.

Following the Council of Chalcedon in 451, a schism occurred in Egypt, between those who accepted and those who rejected the decisions of the council. The former are known as Chalcedonians and the latter are known as miaphysites. Over the next several decades, these two parties competed on the See of Alexandria and frequently still recognized the same Patriarch. But after 536, they permanently established separate patriarchates, and have maintained separate lineages of Patriarchs. The miaphysites became the Coptic Church (part of Oriental Orthodoxy) and the Chalcedonians became the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria (part of the wider Eastern Orthodox Church).

Therefore, this list only contains those Patriarchs who served up until 536. For later Popes and Patriarchs, follow the links at the bottom of this page.

<doc id="273262" wikidata="Q7452220" url="?curid=273262" title="September Dossier">
<text>Iraq&#x27;s Weapons of Mass Destruction: The Assessment of the British Government, also known as the September Dossier, was a document published by the British government on 24 September 2002. Parliament was recalled on the same day to discuss the contents of the document. The paper was part of an ongoing investigation by the government into weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq, which ultimately led to the invasion of Iraq six months later. It contained a number of allegations according to which Iraq also possessed WMD, including chemical weapons and biological weapons. The dossier even alleged that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons programme.

The much-anticipated document was based on reports made by the Joint Intelligence Committee, part of the British Intelligence &#x27;machinery&#x27;. Most of the evidence was uncredited, ostensibly to protect sources. On publication, serious press comment was generally critical of the dossier for tameness and for the seeming lack of any genuinely new evidence. Those politically opposed to military action against Iraq generally agreed that the dossier was unremarkable, with Menzies Campbell observing in the House of Commons that:

However, two sections later became the centre of fierce debate: the allegation that Iraq had sought &quot;significant quantities of uranium from Africa&quot;, and the claim in the foreword to the document written by British Prime Minister Tony Blair that &quot;The document discloses that his military planning allows for some of the WMD to be ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them.&quot;

Britain&#x27;s biggest selling popular daily newspaper, &quot;The Sun&quot;, subsequently carried the headline &quot;Brits 45mins from doom&quot;, while the &quot;Daily Star&quot; reported &quot;Mad Saddam ready to attack: 45 minutes from a chemical war&quot;, helping to create the impression among the British public that Iraq was a threat to Britain.

Major General Michael Laurie, one of those involved in producing the dossier wrote to the Chilcot Inquiry in 2011 saying &quot;the purpose of the dossier was precisely to make a case for war, rather than setting out the available intelligence, and that to make the best out of sparse and inconclusive intelligence the wording was developed with care.&quot; On 26 June 2011, &quot;The Observer&quot; reported on a memo from John Scarlett to Blair&#x27;s foreign affairs adviser, released under the Freedom of Information Act, which referred to &quot;the benefit of obscuring the fact that in terms of WMD Iraq is not that exceptional&quot;. The memo has been described as one of the most significant documents on the September dossier yet published as it is considered a proposal to mislead the public.

== Claims ==
===Uranium from Niger===
The claim that Iraq was seeking to buy uranium from Africa was repeated in US President George W. Bush&#x27;s January 2003 State of the Union Address. The controversial &#x27;16 words&#x27; used by President Bush on 28 January 2003 were:

In March 2003, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it finally obtained the documents referred to by United States Secretary of State Colin Powell to the United Nations Security Council alleging transactions between Niger and Iraq, concluded that they were obvious fakes.

Subsequently, CIA director George Tenet stated that the remarks should not have been included in the US President&#x27;s speech. This followed a remark by US National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, saying that the presence of the line in the speech showed that it had been authorised by the CIA.

In July, Tony Blair testified to the House of Commons Liaison Committee that the evidence the government had regarding Iraq&#x27;s dealings with Niger came from a separate source to the fraudulent documents. Ever since Powell&#x27;s presentation, critics argued that had the US and UK intelligence services fully cooperated with United Nations weapons inspectors, it could have been found out whether the claims were truthful.

The same month, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the Foreign Affairs Select Committee (which was investigating the veracity of the claims in the dossier) that the statement in the dossier rested on separate evidence which was still under review, and that this specific intelligence had not been shared with the CIA. In written evidence to the same committee, however, Straw further disclosed that the intelligence information upon which the British government had relied was shared separately with the IAEA by a foreign government shortly before their report of 7 March 2003. This was further confirmed in a Parliamentary answer to Lynne Jones MP. Lynne Jones subsequently contacted the IAEA to question whether a third party had discussed or shared separate intelligence with them and, if so, what assessment they made of it. IAEA spokesman Mark Gwozdecky responded to Jones on 25 May 2004:

The Foreign Affairs Select Committee judged that the British government had been wrong to state in an unqualified manner something that had not been established beyond doubt:

The privately Blair-appointed Butler Review, whose own report was issued after the aforementioned public investigation, concluded that the report Saddam&#x27;s government was seeking uranium in Africa appeared credible:

The Butler Review also made a specific conclusion on President Bush&#x27;s 16 words: &quot;By extension, we conclude also that the statement in President Bush&#x27;s State of the Union Address of 28 January 2003 that: &#x27;The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.&#x27; was well-founded.&quot;

===The 45 minute claim===
The 45 minute claim lies at the centre of a row between Downing Street and the BBC. On 29 May 2003, BBC defence correspondent Andrew Gilligan filed a report for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme in which he stated that an unnamed source – a senior British official – had told him that the September Dossier had been &quot;sexed up&quot;, and that the intelligence agencies were concerned about some &quot;dubious&quot; information contained within it – specifically the claim that Saddam Hussein could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes of an order to use them.

On 1 June, Gilligan expanded upon that claim in &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; newspaper, stating that the government&#x27;s director of communications, Alastair Campbell, had been responsible for the insertion of the 45-minute claim, against the wishes of the intelligence agencies. Gilligan subsequently gave evidence before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, as did Campbell, who denied ordering the inclusion of the claim, and demanded an apology from the BBC. He subsequently backed this demand in writing.

The BBC refused to apologise, and stood by Gilligan&#x27;s story. Campbell responded angrily, with an appearance on &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;.

On 7 July, the Select Committee published a report which cleared Campbell, albeit on the casting vote of the chairman. In the report, the committee stated that the 45-minute claim had been given &quot;undue prominence&quot;.

On 15 September, MI6 head Richard Dearlove told the Hutton Inquiry that the claim related to battlefield WMD rather than weapons of mass destruction of a larger range than just battlefield. On the same day, Tony Cragg, the retired deputy chief of defence intelligence, admitted there were memos from two members of DIS objecting that parts of the dossier, including the 45-minute claim, was &quot;far too strong&quot; or &quot;over-egged&quot;.

On 28 January 2004, the Hutton Inquiry released its report, which among other things concluded that:
* &quot;Mr Gilligan accepted that he had made errors&quot; about the 45 minute claim; specifically, his report that the government &quot;probably knew that the 45 minutes claim was wrong or questionable&quot;, and his report that intelligence officers were unhappy with the insertion of the claim in the dossier, or only inserted it at the insistence of the government, were erroneous.
* Hutton was &quot;satisfied that Dr Kelly did not say to Mr Gilligan&quot; certain dramatic statements about the 45 minute claim, which Gilligan had reported as direct quotations.
* That only one person (Dr. Jones) had expressed any reservations about the 45 minute claim, and that was about the strength of the wording, not its inclusion.

Information surfacing in late 2009 initially appeared to suggest that the source of the 45 minute claim was in fact a taxi driver &quot;on the Iraqi-Jordanian border, who had remembered an overheard conversation in the back of his cab a full two years earlier&quot;. Whether or not the taxi driver was the source of the 45-minute claim or instead &quot;something about missiles&quot; remains an open question.

It is also claimed by Adam Holloway MP that &quot;When the information was acquired by MI6, a footnote was written on the page of an intelligence report sent to No 10 stating that the claim was &#x27;verifiably inaccurate&#x27;.&quot;

==Role in the death of David Kelly==
The following day, 30 May 2003, the Ministry of Defence claimed that one of its officials (later named as Dr. David Kelly) had come forward, admitting to having discussed the matter of Iraq&#x27;s weapons with Gilligan on 22 May. The BBC responded by saying that Kelly differed from Gilligan&#x27;s key source in &quot;important ways&quot;. Kelly was subsequently called before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee whose conclusion was that Kelly was being used as a scapegoat and that he had not been Gilligan&#x27;s key mole.

On 17 July, Gilligan gave evidence to a private session of the Select Committee, and was subsequently criticised for not naming his source, and for changing his story. The BBC continued to stand by him.

On the same day, Kelly left his home for an area of woodland and was later found dead with his left wrist slit, apparently having committed suicide.

On 20 July, Richard Sambrook, director of news at the BBC, revealed that Kelly was indeed the key source for Gilligan&#x27;s report, and that the BBC had not said so before so as to protect Kelly. The BBC stressed that Gilligan&#x27;s reporting accurately reflected Kelly&#x27;s comments, implying that Kelly had not been entirely truthful with the Select Committee. An inquest into the cause of the death was begun, but was suspended by Lord Falconer.
The BBC committed to assisting fully with the then forthcoming Hutton Inquiry into Kelly&#x27;s death.

On 28 January 2004, the Hutton Inquiry published its report. With regard to the death of Kelly:
* Hutton was &quot;satisfied that Kelly took his own life&quot;
* Hutton was &quot;satisfied that Dr. Kelly did not say to Mr Gilligan&quot; certain dramatic statements which Gilligan had reported as quotations. Regarding certain other statements (reported by Gilligan as quotations but also denied by Kelly), it was &quot;not possible to reach a definite conclusion&quot; whether it was Gilligan or Kelly who had lied.
* Kelly&#x27;s meeting with Gilligan was &quot;in breach of the Civil Service code&quot;
* Kelly may not have originally intended to discuss intelligence matters with Gilligan, but after 29 May he &quot;must have come to realise the gravity of the situation&quot;.
* The BBC&#x27;s investigation into Gilligan&#x27;s report was flawed, and &quot;the Governors should have recognised more fully than they did that their duty to protect the independence of the BBC was not incompatible with giving proper consideration to whether there was validity in the Government&#x27;s complaints&quot;
* The Ministry of Defence (MOD) was at fault for not informing Kelly of their strategy that would involve naming him.

Dissatisfied with the results of the Hutton Inquiry, in 2010 experts called for the suspended inquest to be reopened.

<doc id="273279" wikidata="Q1120961" url="?curid=273279" title="Debits and credits">
<text>Debits and credits in double-entry bookkeeping are entries made in account ledgers to record changes in value resulting from business transactions. A debit entry in an account represents a transfer of value &quot;to&quot; that account, and a credit entry represents a transfer &quot;from&quot; the account. Each transaction transfers value from credited accounts to debited accounts. For example, a tenant who writes a rent cheque to a landlord would enter a credit for the bank account on which the cheque is drawn, and a debit in a rent expense account. Similarly, the landlord would enter a credit in the rent income account associated with the tenant and a debit for the bank account where the cheque is deposited.

Debits and credits are traditionally distinguished by writing the transfer amounts in separate columns of an account book. This practice simplified the manual calculation of net balances before the introduction of computers; each column was added separately, and then the smaller total was subtracted from the larger. Alternatively, debits and credits can be listed in one column, indicating debits with the suffix &quot;Dr&quot; or writing them plain, and indicating credits with the suffix &quot;Cr&quot; or a minus sign. Debits and credits do not, however, correspond in a fixed way to positive and negative numbers. Instead the correspondence depends on the normal balance convention of the particular account.

==History==
The modern double entry system was likely a direct precursor of the first European adaptation many centuries later. The first known use of the terms &quot;debit&quot; and &quot;credit&quot; occurred in the Venetian Luca Pacioli&#x27;s 1494 work, &quot;Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita&quot; (&quot;A Summary of Arithmetic, Geometry, Proportions and Proportionality&quot;). Pacioli devoted one section of his book to documenting and describing the double-entry bookkeeping system in use during the Renaissance by Venetian merchants, traders and bankers. This system is still the fundamental system in use by modern bookkeepers. 
It is sometimes said that, in its original Latin, Pacioli&#x27;s &quot;Summa&quot; used the Latin words (to owe) and (to entrust) to describe the two sides of a closed accounting transaction. Assets were owed to the owner and the owners&#x27; equity was entrusted to the company. At the time negative numbers were not in use. When his work was translated, the Latin words &quot;debere&quot; and &quot;credere&quot; became the English &quot;debit&quot; and &quot;credit&quot;. Under this theory, the abbreviations Dr (for debit) and Cr (for credit) derive directly from the original Latin. However, Sherman casts doubt on this idea because Pacioli uses &quot;Per&quot; (Italian for &quot;by&quot;) for the debtor and &quot;A&quot; (Italian for &quot;to&quot;) for the creditor in the Journal entries. Sherman goes on to say that the earliest text he found that actually uses &quot;Dr.&quot; as an abbreviation in this context was an English text, the third edition (1633) of Ralph Handson&#x27;s book &quot;Analysis or Resolution of Merchant Accompts&quot; and that Handson uses Dr. as an abbreviation for the English word &quot;debtor.&quot; (Sherman could not locate a first edition, but speculates that it too used Dr. for debtor.) The words actually used by Pacioli for the left and right sides of the Ledger are &quot;in dare&quot; and &quot;in havere&quot; (&quot;give&quot; and &quot;receive&quot;). Geijsbeek the translator suggests in the preface: [I]f we today would abolish the use of the words debit and credit in the ledger and substitute the ancient terms of &quot;shall give&quot; and &quot;shall have&quot; or &quot;shall receive&quot;, the personification of accounts in the proper way would not be difficult and, with it, bookkeeping would become more intelligent to the proprietor, the layman and the student.

As Jackson has noted, &quot;debtor&quot; need not be a person, but can be an abstract party: ...it became the practice to extend the meanings of the terms ... beyond their original personal connotation and apply them to inanimate objects and abstract conceptions... This sort of abstraction is already apparent in Richard Dafforne&#x27;s 17th-century text &quot;The Merchant&#x27;s Mirror&quot;, where he states &quot;Cash representeth (to me) a man to whom I … have put my money into his keeping; the which by reason is obliged to render it back.&quot;

==Aspects of transactions==
To determine whether to debit or credit a specific account, we use either the &quot;accounting equation&quot; approach (based on five accounting rules), or the &quot;classical approach&quot; (based on three rules). Whether a &quot;debit&quot; increases or decreases an account&#x27;s net balance depends on what kind of account it is. The basic principle is that the account receiving benefit is debited, while the account giving benefit is credited. For instance, an increase in an &quot;asset&quot; account is a debit. An increase in a &quot;liability&quot; or an &quot;equity&quot; account is a credit.

The classical approach has three golden rules, one for each type of account:

* Real accounts: Debit whatever comes in and credit whatever goes out.
* Personal accounts: Receiver&#x27;s account is debited and giver&#x27;s account is credited.
* Nominal accounts: Expenses and losses are debited and incomes and gains are credited.

Debits and credits occur simultaneously in every financial transaction in double-entry bookkeeping. In the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Equity, so, if an asset account increases (a debit (left)), then either another asset account must decrease (a credit (right)), or a liability or equity account must increase (a credit (right)). In the extended equation, revenues increase equity and expenses, costs &amp; dividends decrease equity, so their difference is the impact on the equation.

For example, if a company provides a service to a customer who does not pay immediately, the company records an increase in assets, Accounts Receivable with a debit entry, and an increase in Revenue, with a credit entry. When the company receives the cash from the customer, two accounts again change on the company side, the cash account is debited (increased) and the Accounts Receivable account is now decreased (credited). When the cash is deposited to the bank account, two things also change from the bank&#x27;s perspective: the bank records an increase in its cash account (debit) and records an increase in its liability to the customer by recording a credit in the customer&#x27;s account (which is not cash). Note that, technically, the deposit is not a decrease in the cash (asset) of the company and should not be recorded as such. It is just a transfer to a proper bank account of record in the company&#x27;s books, not affecting the ledger.

To make it more clear, the bank views the transaction from a different perspective but follows the same rules: the bank&#x27;s vault cash (asset) increases, which is a debit; the increase in the customer&#x27;s account balance (liability from the bank&#x27;s perspective) is a credit. A customer&#x27;s periodic bank statement generally shows transactions from the bank&#x27;s perspective, with cash deposits characterized as credits (liabilities) and withdrawals as debits (reductions in liabilities) in depositor&#x27;s accounts. In the company&#x27;s books the exact opposite entries should be recorded to account for the same cash. This concept is important since this is why so many people misunderstand what debit/credit really means.

==Commercial understanding==
When setting up the accounting for a new business, a number of accounts are established to record all business transactions that are expected to occur. Typical accounts that relate to almost every business are: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Accounts Payable and Retained Earnings. Each account can be broken down further, to provide additional detail as necessary. For example: Accounts Receivable can be broken down to show each customer that owes the company money. In simplistic terms, if Bob, Dave, and Roger owe the company money, the Accounts Receivable account will contain a separate account for Bob, and Dave and Roger. All 3 of these accounts would be added together and shown as a single number (i.e. total &#x27;Accounts Receivable&#x27; – balance owed) on the balance sheet. All accounts for a company are grouped together and summarized on the balance sheet in 3 sections which are: Assets, Liabilities and Equity.

All accounts must first be classified as one of the five types of accounts (accounting elements) ( asset, liability, equity, income and expense). To determine how to classify an account into one of the five elements, the definitions of the five account types must be fully understood. The definition of an asset according to IFRS is as follows, &quot;An asset is a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity&quot;. In simplistic terms, this means that Assets are accounts viewed as having a future value to the company (i.e. cash, accounts receivable, equipment, computers). Liabilities, conversely, would include items that are obligations of the company (i.e. loans, accounts payable, mortgages, debts).

The Equity section of the balance sheet typically shows the value of any outstanding shares that have been issued by the company as well as its earnings. All Income and expense accounts are summarized in the Equity Section in one line on the balance sheet called Retained Earnings. This account, in general, reflects the cumulative profit (retained earnings) or loss (retained deficit) of the company.

The Profit and Loss Statement is an expansion of the Retained Earnings Account. It breaks-out all the Income and expense accounts that were summarized in Retained Earnings. The Profit and Loss report is important in that it shows the detail of sales, cost of sales, expenses and ultimately the profit of the company. Most companies rely heavily on the profit and loss report and review it regularly to enable strategic decision making.

==Terminology==
The words debit and credit can sometimes be confusing because they depend on the point of view from which a transaction is observed. In accounting terms, assets are recorded on the left side (debit) of asset accounts, because they are typically shown on the left side of the accounting equation (&quot;A=L+SE&quot;). Likewise, an increase in liabilities and shareholder&#x27;s equity are recorded on the right side (credit) of those accounts, thus they also maintain the balance of the accounting equation. In other words, if &quot;assets are increased with left side entries, the accounting equation is balanced only if increases in liabilities and shareholder’s equity are recorded on the opposite or right side. Conversely, decreases in assets are recorded on the right side of asset accounts, and decreases in liabilities and equities are recorded on the left side&quot;. Similar is the case with revenues and expenses, what increases shareholder&#x27;s equity is recorded as credit because they are in the right side of equation and vice versa. Typically, when reviewing the financial statements of a business, Assets are Debits and Liabilities and Equity are Credits. For example, when two companies transact with one another say Company A buys something from Company B then Company A will record a decrease in cash (a Credit), and Company B will record an increase in cash (a Debit). The same transaction is recorded from two different perspectives.

This use of the terms can be counter-intuitive to people unfamiliar with bookkeeping concepts, who may always think of a credit as an increase and a debit as a decrease. This is because most people typically only see their personal bank accounts and billing statements (e.g., from a utility). A depositor&#x27;s bank account is actually a Liability to the bank, because the bank legally owes the money to the depositor. Thus, when the customer makes a deposit, the bank credits the account (increases the bank&#x27;s liability). At the same time, the bank adds the money to its own cash holdings account. Since this account is an Asset, the increase is a debit. But the customer typically does not see this side of the transaction.

On the other hand, when a utility customer pays a bill or the utility corrects an overcharge, the customer&#x27;s account is credited. This is because the customer&#x27;s account is one of the utility&#x27;s accounts receivable, which are Assets to the utility because they represent money the utility can expect to receive from the customer in the future. Credits actually decrease Assets (the utility is now owed less money). If the credit is due to a bill payment, then the utility will add the money to its own cash account, which is a debit because the account is another Asset. Again, the customer views the credit as an increase in the customer&#x27;s own money and does not see the other side of the transaction.

===Debit cards and credit cards===
Debit cards and credit cards are creative terms used by the banking industry to market and identify each card. From the cardholder&#x27;s point of view, a credit card account normally contains a credit balance, a debit card account normally contains a debit balance. A debit card is used to make a purchase with one&#x27;s own money. A credit card is used to make a purchase by borrowing money.

From the bank&#x27;s point of view, when a debit card is used to pay a merchant, the payment causes a decrease in the amount of money the bank &quot;owes to&quot; the cardholder. From the bank&#x27;s point of view, your debit card account is the bank&#x27;s liability. A decrease to the bank&#x27;s liability account is a debit. From the bank&#x27;s point of view, when a credit card is used to pay a merchant, the payment causes an increase in the amount of money the bank &quot;is owed by&quot; the cardholder. From the bank&#x27;s point of view, your credit card account is the bank&#x27;s asset. An increase to the bank&#x27;s asset account is a debit. Hence, using a debit card &quot;or&quot; credit card causes a debit to the cardholder&#x27;s account in either situation when viewed from the bank&#x27;s perspective.

===General ledgers===
General ledger is the term for the comprehensive collection of T-accounts (it is so called because there was a pre-printed vertical line in the middle of each ledger page and a horizontal line at the top of each ledger page, like a large letter T). Before the advent of computerized accounting, manual accounting procedure used a ledger book for each T-account. The collection of all these books was called the general ledger. The &quot;chart of accounts&quot; is the table of contents of the general ledger. Totaling of all debits and credits in the general ledger at the end of a financial period is known as &quot;trial balance&quot;.

&quot;Daybooks&quot; or journals are used to list every single transaction that took place during the day, and the list is totaled at the end of the day. These daybooks are not part of the double-entry bookkeeping system. The information recorded in these daybooks is then transferred to the general ledgers, where it is said to be &quot;posted&quot;. Modern computer software allows for the instant update of each ledger account; for example, when recording a cash receipt in a cash receipts journal a debit is posted to a cash ledger account with a corresponding credit to the ledger account from which the cash was received. Not every single transaction needs to be entered into a T-account; usually only the sum (the batch total) for the day of each book transaction is entered in the general ledger.

==The five accounting elements==
There are five fundamental elements within accounting. These elements are as follows: Assets, Liabilities, Equity (or Capital), Income (or Revenue) and Expenses. The five accounting elements are all affected in either a positive or negative way. A credit transaction does not always dictate a positive value or increase in a transaction and similarly, a debit does not always indicate a negative value or decrease in a transaction. An asset account is often referred to as a &quot;debit account&quot; due to the account&#x27;s standard &quot;increasing&quot; attribute on the debit side. When an asset (e.g. an espresso machine) has been acquired in a business, the transaction will affect the debit side of that asset account illustrated below:

The &quot;X&quot; in the debit column denotes the increasing effect of a transaction on the asset &quot;account balance&quot; (total debits less total credits), because a debit to an asset account is an increase. The asset account above has been &quot;added to&quot; by a debit value X, i.e. the balance has increased by £X or $X. Likewise, in the liability account below, the X in the credit column denotes the increasing effect on the liability account balance (total credits less total debits), because a credit to a liability account is an increase.

&quot;All &quot;mini-ledgers&quot; in this section show standard increasing attributes for the five elements of accounting.&quot;




&quot;Summary table of standard increasing and decreasing attributes for the accounting elements:&quot;
===Attributes of accounting elements per real, personal, and nominal accounts===
Real accounts are assets. Personal accounts are liabilities and owners&#x27; equity and represent people and entities that have invested in the business. Nominal accounts are revenue, expenses, gains, and losses. Accountants close out accounts at the end of each accounting period. This method is known as the traditional approach.

==Principle==

Each transaction that takes place within the business will consist of at least one debit to a specific account and at least one credit to another specific account. A debit to one account can be balanced by more than one credit to other accounts, and vice versa. For all transactions, the total debits must be equal to the total credits and therefore &quot;balance&quot;.

The &quot;general&quot; accounting equation is as follows:
:Assets = Equity + Liabilities,
:A = E + L.

The equation thus becomes A – L – E = 0 (zero). When the total debits equals the total credits for each account, then the equation balances.

The &quot;extended&quot; accounting equation is as follows:
:Assets + Expenses = Equity/Capital + Liabilities + Income,
:A + Ex = E + L + I.
In this form, increases to the amount of accounts on the left-hand side of the equation are recorded as debits, and decreases as credits. Conversely for accounts on the right-hand side, increases to the amount of accounts are recorded as credits to the account, and decreases as debits.

This can also be rewritten in the equivalent form:
:Assets = Liabilities + Equity/Capital + (Income − Expenses),
:A = L + E + (I − Ex),
where the relationship of the Income and Expenses accounts to Equity and profit is a bit clearer.
Here Income and Expenses are regarded as temporary or nominal accounts which pertain only to the current accounting period whereas Asset, Liability, and Equity accounts are permanent or real accounts pertaining to the lifetime of the business. The temporary accounts are closed to the Equity account at the end of the accounting period to record profit/loss for the period. Both sides of these equations must be equal (balance).

Each transaction is recorded in a ledger or &quot;T&quot; account, e.g. a ledger account named &quot;Bank&quot; that can be changed with either a debit or credit transaction.

In accounting it is acceptable to draw-up a ledger account in the following manner for representation purposes:

===Accounts pertaining to the five accounting elements===
Accounts are created/opened when the need arises for whatever purpose or situation the entity may have. For example, if your business is an airline company they will have to purchase airplanes, therefore even if an account is not listed below, a bookkeeper or accountant can create an account for a specific item, such as an asset account for airplanes. In order to understand how to classify an account into one of the five elements, a good understanding of the &quot;definitions&quot; of these accounts is required. Below are examples of some of the more common accounts that pertain to the five accounting elements:

====Asset accounts====
Asset accounts are economic resources which benefit the business/entity and will continue to do so. They are Cash, bank, accounts receivable, inventory, land, buildings/plant, machinery, furniture, equipment, supplies, vehicles, trademarks and patents, goodwill, prepaid expenses, prepaid insurance, debtors (people who owe us money, due within one year), VAT input etc.

Two types of basic asset classification:
* Current assets: Assets which operate in a financial year or assets that can be used up, or converted within one year or less are called current assets. For example, Cash, bank, accounts receivable, inventory (people who owe us money, due within one year), prepaid expenses, prepaid insurance, VAT input and many more. 
* Non-current assets: Assets that are not recorded in transactions or hold for more than one year or in an accounting period are called Non-current assets. For example, land, buildings/plant, machinery, furniture, equipment, vehicles, trademarks and patents, goodwill etc.

====Liability accounts====
Liability accounts record debts or future obligations a business or entity owes to others. When one institution borrows from another for a period of time, the ledger of the borrowing institution categorises the argument under liability accounts.

The basic classifications of liability accounts are:
* Current liability, when money only may be owed for the current accounting period or periodical. Examples include accounts payable, salaries and wages payable, income taxes, bank overdrafts, accrued expenses, sales taxes, advance payments (unearned revenue), debt and accrued interest on debt, customer deposits, VAT output, etc.
* Long-term liability, when money may be owed for more than one year. Examples include trust accounts, debenture, mortgage loans and more.

====Equity accounts====
Equity accounts record the claims of the owners of the business/entity to the assets of that business/entity.
Capital, retained earnings, drawings, common stock, accumulated funds, etc.

====Income/revenue accounts====
Income accounts record all increases in Equity other than that contributed by the owner/s of the business/entity.
Services rendered, sales, interest income, membership fees, rent income, interest from investment, recurring receivables, donation etc.

====Expense accounts====
Expense accounts record all decreases in the owners&#x27; equity which occur from using the assets or increasing liabilities in delivering goods or services to a customer – the costs of doing business.
Telephone, water, electricity, repairs, salaries, wages, depreciation, bad debts, stationery, entertainment, honorarium, rent, fuel, utility, interest etc.

===Example===
Quick Services business purchases a computer for £500, on credit, from ABC Computers. Recognize the following transaction for Quick Services in a ledger account (T-account):

Quick Services has acquired a new computer which is classified as an asset within the business. According to the accrual basis of accounting, even though the computer has been purchased on credit, the computer is already the property of Quick Services and must be recognised as such. Therefore, the equipment account of Quick Services increases and is debited:

As the transaction for the new computer is made &quot;on credit&quot;, the payable &quot;ABC Computers&quot; has not yet been paid. As a result, a liability is created within the entity&#x27;s records. Therefore, to balance the accounting equation the corresponding liability account is credited:

The above example can be written in journal form:
The journal entry &quot;ABC Computers&quot; is indented to indicate that this is the credit transaction. It is accepted accounting practice to indent credit transactions recorded within a journal.

In the accounting equation form:
:A = E + L,
:500 = 0 + 500 (the accounting equation is therefore balanced).

===Further examples===
# A business pays rent with cash: You increase rent (expense) by recording a debit transaction, and decrease cash (asset) by recording a credit transaction.
# A business receives cash for a sale: You increase cash (asset) by recording a debit transaction, and increase sales (income) by recording a credit transaction.
# A business buys equipment with cash: You increase equipment (asset) by recording a debit transaction, and decrease cash (asset) by recording a credit transaction.
# A business borrows with a cash loan: You increase cash (asset) by recording a debit transaction, and increase loan (liability) by recording a credit transaction.
# A business pays salaries with cash: You increase salary (expenses) by recording a debit transaction, and decrease cash (asset) by recording a credit transaction.
# The totals show the net effect on the accounting equation and the double-entry principle, where the transactions are balanced.

==T-accounts==
The process of using debits and credits creates a ledger format that resembles the letter &quot;T&quot;. The term &quot;T-account&quot; is accounting jargon for a &quot;ledger account&quot; and is often used when discussing bookkeeping. The reason that a ledger account is often referred to as a T-account is due to the way the account is physically drawn on paper (representing a &quot;T&quot;). The left column is for debit (Dr) entries, while the right column is for credit (Cr) entries.

==Contra account==
All accounts also can be debited or credited depending on what transaction has taken place. For example, when a vehicle is purchased using cash, the asset account &quot;Vehicles&quot; is &quot;debited&quot; and simultaneously the asset account &quot;Bank or Cash&quot; is &quot;credited&quot; due to the payment for the vehicle using cash. Some balance sheet items have corresponding &quot;contra&quot; accounts, with negative balances, that offset them. Examples are accumulated depreciation against equipment, and allowance for bad debts (also known as allowance for doubtful accounts) against accounts receivable. United States GAAP utilizes the term &quot;contra&quot; for specific accounts only and does not recognize the second half of a transaction as a contra, thus the term is restricted to accounts that are related. For example, sales returns and allowance and sales discounts are contra revenues with respect to sales, as the balance of each contra (a debit) is the opposite of sales (a credit). To understand the actual value of sales, one must net the contras against sales, which gives rise to the term net sales (meaning net of the contras).

A more specific definition in common use is an account with a balance that is the opposite of the normal balance (Dr/Cr) for that section of the general ledger. An example is an office coffee fund: Expense &quot;Coffee&quot; (Dr) may be immediately followed by &quot;Coffee – employee contributions&quot; (Cr). Such an account is used for clarity rather than being a necessary part of GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles).

==Accounts classification==
Each of the following accounts is either an Asset (A), Contra Account (CA), Liability (L), Shareholders&#x27; Equity (SE), Revenue (Rev), Expense (Exp) or Dividend (Div) account.

Account transactions can be recorded as a debit to one account and a credit to another account using the modern or traditional approaches in accounting and following are their normal balances:

<doc id="273285" wikidata="Q2035701" url="?curid=273285" title="Race and ethnicity in the United States census">
<text>In the United States census, the US Census Bureau and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) define a set of self-identified categories of race and ethnicity chosen by residents, with which they most closely identify. Residents can indicate their origins alongside their race, and are asked specifically whether they are of Hispanic or Latino origin in a separate question.

The racial categories represent a social-political construct for the race or races that respondents consider themselves to be and, &quot;generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country&quot;. The OMB defines the concept of race as outlined for the census to be not &quot;scientific or anthropological&quot;, and takes into account &quot;social and cultural characteristics as well as ancestry&quot;, using &quot;appropriate scientific methodologies&quot; that are not &quot;primarily biological or genetic in reference.&quot; The race categories include both racial and national-origin groups.

Race and ethnicity are considered separate and distinct identities, with a person&#x27;s origins considered in the census. Thus, in addition to their race or races, all respondents are categorized by membership in one of two ethnic categories, which are &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; and &quot;Not Hispanic or Latino.&quot; However, the practice of separating &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; as different categories has been criticized both by the American Anthropological Association and members of US Commission on Civil Rights.

In 1997, the OMB issued a Federal Register notice regarding revisions to the standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity. The OMB developed race and ethnic standards in order to provide &quot;consistent data on race and ethnicity throughout the federal government&quot;. The development of the data standards stem in large measure from new responsibilities to enforce civil rights laws. Among the changes, The OMB issued the instruction to &quot;mark one or more races&quot; after noting evidence of increasing numbers of mixed-race children and wanting to record diversity in a measurable way after having received requests by people who wanted to be able to acknowledge theirs and their children&#x27;s full ancestry, rather than identifying with only one group. Prior to this decision, the census and other government data collections asked people to report singular races.

As of 2023, the OMB built on the 1997 guidelines and suggested the addition of a Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) racial category and considered combining racial and ethnic categories into one question. In March 2024, the Office of Management and Budget published revisions to Statistical Policy Directive No. 15: Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity that included a combined question and a MENA category, while also collecting additional detail to enable data disaggregation.

The U.S. Census Bureau doesn&#x27;t include the option ideological aracialism (the none race). Ethnocultural nonconformity is a biased term which implies that ethnocultural conformity is preferred, but no view is legally superior; also neither this option is included. Race is self-reported and it&#x27;s the ideology of social compartmentalization with corporeal (bodily) criteria. It&#x27;s by no means the sole ideology. The rejection of a major concept should be clearly declared thus it cannot be part of the option &quot;other race&quot;. US human rights organizations never fought for the rights of the racial nones (ideological aracialists).

== How data on race and ethnicity is used ==
The OMB states, .

Data on ethnic groups are important for putting into effect a number of federal statutes (i.e., enforcing bilingual election rules under the Voting Rights Act and monitoring/enforcing equal employment opportunities under the Civil Rights Act). Data on ethnic groups is also needed by local governments to run programs and meet legislative requirements (i.e., identifying segments of the population who may not be receiving medical services under the Public Health Service Act; evaluating whether financial institutions are meeting the credit needs of minority populations under the Community Reinvestment Act).

== Brief overview of history ==
=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
==== 1790 census ====
The 1790 United States census was the first census in the history of the United States. The population of the United States was recorded as 3,929,214 as of Census Day, August 2, 1790, as mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the US Constitution and applicable laws.

The law required that every household be visited, that completed census schedules be posted in two of the most public places within each jurisdiction, remain for the inspection of all concerned, and that &quot;the aggregate amount of each description of persons&quot; for every district be transmitted to the president. The US Marshals were also responsible for governing the census.

===== Loss of data =====
About one-third of the original census data has been lost or destroyed since documentation. The data was lost in 1790–1830, and included data from Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia. However, the census was proven factual and the existence of most of this data can be confirmed in many secondary sources pertaining to the first census.

===== Data =====
Census data included the name of the head of the family and categorized inhabitants as: free white males at least 16 years of age (to assess the country&#x27;s industrial and military potential), free white males under 16 years of age, free white females, all other free persons (reported by sex and color), and slaves. Thomas Jefferson, then the Secretary of State, directed US Marshals to collect data from all 13 original states, and from the Southwest Territory. The census was not conducted in Vermont until 1791, after that state&#x27;s admission to the Union as the 14th state on March 4 of that year.


===== Contemporary perception =====
Some doubt surrounded the numbers, as President George Washington and Thomas Jefferson maintained the population was undercounted. The potential reasons Washington and Jefferson may have thought this could be refusal to participate, poor public transportation and roads, spread-out population, and restraints of current technology.

===== Data availability =====
No microdata from the 1790 population census are available, but aggregate data for small areas and their compatible cartographic boundary files, can be downloaded from the National Historical Geographic Information System. However, the categories of &quot;Free white males&quot; of 16 years and upward, including heads of families under 16 years, &quot;Free white females&quot;, including heads of families, All other free persons, and &quot;Slaves,&quot; existed in the census form.

==== 1800 and 1810 census ====
In 1800 and 1810, the age question regarding free white males was more detailed with five cohorts and included All other free persons, except &quot;Indians not taxed&quot;, and &quot;Slaves&quot;.

==== 1820 census ====
The 1820 census built on the questions asked in 1810 by asking age questions about slaves. Also the term &quot;colored&quot; entered the census nomenclature. In addition, a question stating &quot;Number of foreigners not naturalized&quot; was included.

==== 1830 census ====
In the 1830 census, a new question, which stated, &quot;The number of White persons who were foreigners not naturalized&quot; was included.

==== 1850 census ====
The 1850 census had a dramatic shift in the way information about residents was collected. For the first time, free persons were listed individually instead of by head of household. Two questionnaires were used – one for free inhabitants and one for slaves. The question on the free inhabitants schedule about color was a column that was to be left blank if a person were white, marked &quot;B&quot; if a person were black, and marked &quot;M&quot; if a person were mulatto. Slaves were listed by owner, and classified by gender and age, not individually, and the question about color was a column that was to be marked with a &quot;B&quot; if the slave were black and an &quot;M&quot; if mulatto.

==== 1890 census ====
For 1890, the Census Office changed the design of the population questionnaire. Residents were still listed individually, but a new questionnaire sheet was used for each family. Additionally, this was the first year that the census distinguished among different Asian ethnic groups, such as Japanese and Chinese, due to increased immigration. This census also marked the beginning of the term &quot;race&quot; in the questionnaires. Enumerators were instructed to write &quot;White&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Mulatto&quot;, &quot;Quadroon&quot;, &quot;Octoroon&quot;, &quot;Chinese&quot;, &quot;Japanese&quot;, or &quot;Indian&quot;.

==== 1900 census ====
During 1900, the &quot;Color or Race&quot; question was slightly modified, removing the term &quot;Mulatto&quot;. Also, there was an inclusion of an &quot;Indian Population Schedule&quot; in which &quot;enumerators were instructed to use a special expanded questionnaire for American Indians living on reservations or in family groups off of reservations.&quot; This expanded version included the question &quot;Fraction of person&#x27;s lineage that is white.&quot;

=== 20th century ===
==== 1910 census ====
The 1910 census was similar to that of 1900, but it included a reinsertion of &quot;Mulatto&quot; and a question about the &quot;mother tongue&quot; of foreign-born individuals and individuals with foreign-born parents. &quot;Ot&quot; was also added to signify &quot;other races&quot;, with space for a race to be written in. This decade&#x27;s version of the Indian Population Schedule featured questions asking the individual&#x27;s proportion of white, black, or American Indian lineage.

==== 1920 census ====
The 1920 census questionnaire was similar to 1910, but excluded a separate schedule for American Indians. &quot;Hin&quot;, &quot;Kor&quot;, and &quot;Fil&quot; were also added to the &quot;Color or Race&quot; question, signifying Hindu (Asian Indian), Korean, and Filipino, respectively.

==== 1930 census ====
 The biggest change in this census was in racial classification. Enumerators were instructed to no longer use the &quot;Mulatto&quot; classification. Instead, they were given special instructions for reporting the race of interracial persons. A person with both white and black ancestry (termed &quot;blood&quot;) was to be recorded as &quot;Negro&quot;, no matter the fraction of that lineage (the &quot;one-drop rule&quot;). A person of mixed black and American Indian ancestry was also to be recorded as &quot;Neg&quot; (for &quot;Negro&quot;) unless they were considered to be &quot;predominantly&quot; American Indian and accepted as such within the community. A person with both white and American Indian ancestry was to be recorded as American Indian, unless their Indigenous ancestry was small, and they were accepted as white within the community. In all situations in which a person had white and some other racial ancestry, they were to be reported as that other race. People who had minority interracial ancestry were to be reported as the race of their father.

For the first and only time, &quot;Mexican&quot; was listed as a race. Enumerators were instructed that all people born in Mexico, or whose parents were born in Mexico, should be listed as Mexicans, and not under any other racial category. In prior censuses and in 1940, enumerators were instructed to list Mexican Americans as white, perhaps because some of them were of white background (mainly Spanish), many others mixed white and Native American and some of them Native American.

The supplemental American Indian questionnaire was back, but in abbreviated form. It featured a question asking if the person was of full or mixed American Indian ancestry.

==== 1940 census ====
President Franklin D. Roosevelt promoted a Good Neighbor policy that sought better relations with Mexico. In 1935, a federal judge ruled that three Mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white, as required by federal law. Mexico protested, and Roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white. The State Department, the Census Bureau, the Labor Department, and other government agencies therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of Mexican descent as white. This policy encouraged the League of United Latin American Citizens in its quest to minimize discrimination by asserting their whiteness.

The 1940 census was the first to include separate population and housing questionnaires. The race category of &quot;Mexican&quot; was eliminated in 1940, and the population of Mexican descent was counted with the white population.

1940 census data was used for Japanese American internment. The Census Bureau&#x27;s role was denied for decades, but was finally proven in 2007.

==== 1950 census ====
The 1950 census questionnaire removed the word &quot;color&quot; from the racial question, and also removed Hindu and Korean from the race choices.

==== 1960 census ====
The 1960 census re-added the word &quot;color&quot; to the racial question, and changed &quot;Indian&quot; to &quot;American Indian&quot;, as well as adding Hawaiian, Part-Hawaiian, Aleut, and Eskimo. The &quot;Other (print out race)&quot; option was removed.

==== 1970 census ====
This year&#x27;s census included &quot;Negro or Black&quot;, re-added Korean and the Other race option. East Indians (the term used at that time for people whose ancestry is from the Indian subcontinent) were counted as White. There was a questionnaire that was asked of only a sample of respondents. These questions were as follows:
# 
# What country was the person&#x27;s father born in?
# What country was the person&#x27;s mother born in?
# a. For persons born in a foreign country – Is the person naturalized?
# b When did the person come to the United States to stay?
# What language, other than English, was spoken in the person&#x27;s home as a child?
# Spanish
# French
# Italian
# German
# Other
# None, only English
&quot;Questions on Spanish or Hispanic Origin or Descent&quot;

Is this person&#x27;s origin or descent?

Mexican

Puerto Rican Cuban

Central American Other Spanish

No, none of these

==== 1980 census ====
This year added several options to the race question, including Vietnamese, Indian (East), Guamanian, Samoan, and re-added Aleut. Again, the term &quot;color&quot; was removed from the racial question, and the following questions were asked of a sample of respondents:
# 
# If this person was born in a foreign country...
# a. Is this person a naturalized citizen of the United States?
# b. When did this person come to the United States to stay?
# a. Does this person speak a language other than English at home?
# b. If yes, what is this language?
# c. If yes, how well does this person speak English?
# What is this person&#x27;s ancestry?
 &quot;Questions on Spanish or Hispanic Origin or Descent&quot; &quot;&quot;

Is this person of Spanish/Hispanic origin or descent?

No, not Spanish/Hispanic

Yes, Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano

Yes, Puerto Rican

Yes, Cuban

Yes, other Spanish/Hispanic

==== 1990 census ====
The racial categories in this year are as they appear in the 2000 and 2010 censuses. The following questions were asked of a sample of respondents for the 1990 census:
# 
# Is this person a citizen of the United States?
# If this person was not born in the United States, when did this person come to the United States to stay?
The 1990 census was not designed to capture multiple racial responses, and when individuals marked the &quot;other&quot; race option and provided a multiple write-in. The response was assigned according to the race written first. &quot;For example, a write-in of &#x27;black-white&#x27; was assigned a code of &#x27;black,&#x27; while a write-in of &#x27;white-black&#x27; was assigned a code of &#x27;white.

&quot;Questions on Spanish or Hispanic Origin or Descent&quot;

Is this person of Spanish/Hispanic origin?

No, not Spanish/Hispanic

Yes, Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano

Yes, Puerto Rican

Yes, Cuban

Yes, other Spanish/Hispanic, print one group ...

&quot;Census data indicate that the number of children in interracial families grew from less than one-half million in 1970 to about two million in 1990. In 1990, for interracial families with one White partner, the other parent was Black for about 20 percent of all children, the other parent was Asian for 45 percent, and the other parent was American Indian and Alaska Native for about 34 percent.&quot;

==== 2000 census ====
Race was asked differently in the 2000 census in several other ways than previously. Most significantly, respondents were given the option of selecting one or more race categories to indicate racial identities. Data show that nearly seven million Americans identified as members of two or more races. Because of these changes, the 2000 census data on race are not directly comparable with data from the 1990 census or earlier censuses. Use of caution is therefore recommended when interpreting changes in the racial composition of the US population over time.

The following definitions apply to the 2000 census only.
* White — A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as &quot;white-skinned people&quot; or report entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish.
* Black or African American — A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as &quot;Black, African Am., or Negro&quot;, or provide written entries such as African American, Afro American, Kenyan, Nigerian, or Haitian.
* American Indian and Alaska Native — A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintain tribal affiliation or community attachment.
* Asian — A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. It includes &quot;Asian Indian&quot;, &quot;Chinese&quot;, &quot;Filipino&quot;, &quot;Korean&quot;, &quot;Japanese&quot;, &quot;Vietnamese&quot;, and &quot;Other Asian&quot;.
* Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander — A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. It includes people who indicate their race as &quot;Native Hawaiian&quot;, &quot;Guamanian or Chamorro&quot;, &quot;Samoan&quot;, and &quot;Other Pacific Islander&quot;.
* Some other race — Includes all other responses not included in the &quot;White&quot;, &quot;Black or African American&quot;, &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native&quot;, &quot;Asian&quot;, and &quot;Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander&quot; race categories described above. Respondents providing write-in entries such as multiracial, mixed, interracial, We-Sort, or a Hispanic/Latino group (for example, Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban) in the &quot;Some other race&quot; category are included here.
* Two or more races — People may have chosen to provide two or more races either by checking two or more race response check boxes, by providing multiple write-in responses, or by some combination of check boxes and write-in responses.

The federal government of the United States has mandated that &quot;in data collection and presentation, federal agencies are required to use a minimum of two ethnicities: &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; and &quot;Not Hispanic or Latino&quot;. The Census Bureau defines &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; as &quot;a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race.&quot;

Use of the word &quot;ethnicity&quot; for Hispanics only is considerably more restricted than its conventional meaning, which covers other distinctions, some of which are covered by the &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ancestry&quot; questions. The distinct questions accommodate the possibility of Hispanic and Latino Americans&#x27; also declaring various racial identities (see also White Hispanic and Latino Americans, Black Hispanic and Latino Americans, and Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans).

In the 2000 census, 12.5% of the US population reported &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; ethnicity and 87.5% reported &quot;Not-Hispanic or Latino&quot; ethnicity.

=== 21st century ===
==== 2010 census ====
The 2010 census included changes designed to more clearly distinguish Hispanic ethnicity as not being a race. That included adding the sentence: &quot;For this census, Hispanic origins are not races.&quot; Additionally, the Hispanic terms were modified from &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; to &quot;Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin&quot;.

Although used in the census and the American Community Survey, &quot;Some other race&quot; is not an official race, and the Bureau considered eliminating it prior to the 2000 census. As the 2010 census form did not contain the question titled &quot;Ancestry&quot; found in prior censuses, there were campaigns to get non-Hispanic West Indian Americans, Turkish Americans, Armenian Americans, Arab Americans, and Iranian Americans to indicate their ethnic or national background through the race question, specifically the &quot;Some other race&quot; category.

The Interagency Committee has suggested that the concept of marking multiple boxes be extended to the Hispanic origin question, thereby freeing individuals from having to choose between their parents&#x27; ethnic heritages. In other words, a respondent could choose both &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; and &quot;Not Hispanic or Latino&quot;.

==== 2020 census ====
The 2020 census featured similar designs to the 2000 and 2010 censuses. Subsequently, the Census Bureau adhered to the 1997 OMB standards and thus used two separate questions to collect data on race and ethnicity. However, there were improvements in the phrasing of the race and ethnicity questions within the OMB guidelines, that would enhance clarity for respondents.

The Hispanic origin question included the same checkboxes as the 2010 census (&quot;Mexican, Mexican Am., Chicano&quot;, &quot;Puerto Rican&quot;, &quot;Cuban&quot;), along with a &quot;Yes, another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin&quot;. Under this category, two changes emerged. The first was the shift from &quot;Print origin, for example&quot; to &quot;Print, for example&quot;. The removal of the word origin was due to the surveyed confusion and differentiating meanings origin has for respondents or varying backgrounds. Furthermore, the Census Bureau updated the write-in instructions for the &quot;Some Other Race&quot; category and included the instruction to &quot;Print race&quot;, but changed the instruction to read &quot;Print race or origin&quot; to match the primary instruction to &quot;Mark ☒ one or more boxes AND print origins&quot;.

According to the United States Census Bureau, as a result of significant feedback, a detailed write-in response and example were included for the &quot;White&quot; and the &quot;Black or African Am.&quot; racial categories to compensate a wider horizon of identities. There were also six example groups for each of the &quot;White&quot;, &quot;Black or African American&quot;, and &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native&quot; racial categories. In addition, after 100 years, the term &quot;Negro&quot; was removed from the 2020 census, as a large portion of respondents advocated for its removal. Instead, the category shifted from &quot;Black, African Am., or Negro&quot; to &quot;Black or African Am.&quot; on paper questionnaires and electronic instruments.

The identification of the term African American first occurred in the 2000 census, reflecting a long-standing history of offensive terminology since the censuses&#x27; inception. The 1790 census included other &quot;free persons&quot; by color and &quot;slaves&quot;. From 1850 to 1880, the codes for enumerators were generally Black (B) and Mulatto (M). In 1900, there were no specified categories on the census listing form, and the instructions called for enumerators to list &quot;B&quot; for &quot;Black (or negro or negro descent)&quot;, displaying the first occurrence of the controversial term &quot;Negro&quot;. In 1930, there were specific instructions that used the term &quot;Negro&quot;. Mixed persons were to be counted as &quot;Negro&quot; no matter how small the share of blood, also known as the one-drop rule. It was not until 1970 that the term Black appeared on a census form, and in 1990 the enumerator of color was eliminated.

The 2020 census was also &quot;the first to specifically solicit Middle Eastern North African (MENA) responses&quot; through the write-in response for the White racial category. The term MENA includes the Arab American population, which is growing quickly as of 2023. This allowed the 2020 census to include dis-aggregated data on MENA populations, which made up over 3.5 million Americans. California, New York, and Michigan have the largest MENA populations, and Lebanese, Iranian, and Egyptian populations made up nearly half of them. This was almost triple the 2000 census&#x27; estimate of a population of 1.2 million Arab Americans, based on the &quot;Ancestry&quot; question rather than the racial category question. That number may have been an under count however, as 19% of the American population provided no answer for the &quot;Ancestry&quot; question.

This is significant because MENA identities were previously only tracked through the &quot;Ancestry&quot; write-in question on the American Community Survey in 2010. The Arab American population was then estimated through the number of responses that included one or more Arab ancestries. The 2020 census changed this by explicitly prompting write-in responses with Arab American examples listed as &quot;Print, for example, German, Irish, English, Italian, Lebanese, Egyptian, etc&quot;.

The improvements are part of a larger effort reviewing the 1997 OMB guidelines, specifically to move MENA from under the White racial category into a new label. An OMB working group officially recommended a new MENA category in 2023 based on public feedback going back to 2015 and &quot;plans to make final decisions on revisions by Summer 2024&quot;. Many people in the community &quot;may not be perceived, nor perceive themselves, to be White&quot;. The added category could allow for more targeted funding, social programs, and political representation. A 2015 study from Rutgers University found significant inequalities in household income, citizenship rates, and English-speaking rates between New Jersey&#x27;s White population and Arab population, concluding that America&#x27;s White and Arab populations might be different enough both culturally and economically to justify a separate category.

The next change was reordering the example groups from &quot;Argentinean, Colombian, Dominican, Nicaraguan, Salvadoran, Spaniard, and so on.&quot; to &quot;Salvadoran, Dominican, Colombian, Guatemalan, Spaniard, Ecuadorian, etc.&quot; to reflect the ever-increasing geographic diversity of the Hispanic or Latino category and the variations in populations sums each year.

*Net coverage error is statistically significantly different from 0.

Though the issues of identification questions of origin were addressed, the accuracy of the 2020 census displays undercounts and overcounts of Black people, Latinos, and Native Americans according to the work conducted under Robert Santos, the current director of the United States Census Bureau. A follow-up survey concluded that the miscounting of children under five years of age and that American Indians and Alaska Natives living on reservations continued to have the highest net undercount rate, similar to 2010. One of the leading factors of the misrepresented information in the 2020 census is the coronavirus pandemic, which caused notable delays in the Census Bureau&#x27;s Post-Enumeration Survey. The Post-Enumeration Survey is used to determine how accurate the census results are and inform planning for the next national count in 2030. Furthermore, discrepancies persisted due to the irrefutable variables of delays to field work, migration of many college students and others, and some respondents failed to answer the necessary questions required for the Post-Enumeration Survey to match the census. Journalist Michael Wines of the &quot;New York Times&quot; attributes group quarters like college dormitories, long-term care facilities and prisons to have the largest contingencies in the tally as the pandemic pushed many university students to return home, making it harder to count them in the dormitories or apartments where they normally would have been.

Hispanic or Latino

Translating the data set, the 3.45 difference in net coverage error for the Hispanic or Latino category proves widely problematic, but is an avid reflection of the seismic shifts in the United States. Mexican immigrants have been at the center of one of the largest mass migrations in contemporary history, reaching a peak of 12.8 million in 2007, but have since declined, as reported by the Pew Research Center. The predominant reasoning being shifts in political authority and the coronavirus pandemic resulting in policy changes. More specifically, immigrants entering through a permanent legal residency (green card), visa overstays, and apprehensions have drastically changed the input and output of data.

The total number of non-immigrant visas processed in Mexico by the US Department of State dropped 35% in 2020 compared with the prior year, from about 1.5 million in 2019 to about 960,000 in 2020. The temporary visas were processed for tourism, business, or crossing the border. Consequently, due to political shifts, apprehensions of unauthorized Mexican immigrants increased considerably after the pandemic started in 2020. In fiscal 2020, the number of detainments of Mexican adults at the US-Mexican border reached sky-high new levels under former president Donald Trump. There were 253,118 such encounters, up 52% from 166,458 the previous year.

== Relation between ethnicity and race in census results ==
The Census Bureau warns that data on race in 2000 census are not directly comparable to those collected in previous censuses. Many residents of the United States consider race and ethnicity to be the same.

In the 2000 census, respondents were tallied in each of the race groups they reported. Consequently, the total of each racial category exceeds the total population because some people reported more than one race.

According to James P. Allen and Eugene Turner from California State University, Northridge, by some calculations in the 2000 census the largest part white biracial population is white/Native American and Alaskan Native, at 7,015,017, followed by white/black at 737,492, then white/Asian at 727,197, and finally white/Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander at 125,628.

The Census Bureau implemented a Census Quality Survey, gathering data from about 50,000 households to assess the reporting of race and Hispanic origin in the 2000 census with the purpose of creating a way to make comparisons between the 2000 census with previous census racial data.

In September 1997, during the process of revision of racial categories previously declared by OMB Directive No. 15, the American Anthropological Association (AAA) recommended that OMB combine the &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; categories into one question to appear as &quot;race/ethnicity&quot; for the 2000 census. The Interagency Committee agreed, stating that &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; were not sufficiently defined and &quot;that many respondents conceptualize &#x27;race&#x27; and &#x27;ethnicity&#x27; as one and the same underscor[ing] the need to consolidate these terms into one category, using a term that is more meaningful to the American people.&quot;

The AAA also stated:
The recommendations of the AAA were not adopted by the Census Bureau for the 2000, 2010, and 2020 censuses. This includes Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin, which remained an ethnicity, not a race. While race/ethnicity definitions for 2020 remained consistent, individuals who identify as White, Black/African American, and/or American Indian or Alaska Native were asked to specifically identify their racial origins.

== Other agencies ==
In 2001, the National Institutes of Health adopted the new language to comply with the revisions to Directive 15, as did the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of the United States Department of Labor in 2007.

<text>Maximianus of Constantinople (Greek: Μαξιμινιανός; died 12 April 434) was the archbishop of Constantinople from 25 October 431 until his death on 12 April 434.

== Biography ==
Maximianus was born in Rome from wealthy and pious parents. He had led a monastic life and had entered presbyteral orders; his action in building, at his own expense, tombs for the remains of holy men had obtained for him a reputation of sanctity. Sisinnius I of Constantinople ordained him presbyter.

The action of the first Council of Ephesus had thrown the churches of Constantinople into direst confusion. A large proportion of the citizens held strongly to Nestorius; the clergy, with one voice, agreed in the anathema. When the deposition became a fact no longer to be disputed, the excitement was continued about the election of a successor. After four months, agreement was arrived at in the election of Maximian.

In principles he followed the former archbishops, John Chrysostom, Atticus of Constantinople, and Sisinnius I of Constantinople. Pope Celestine I wrote to him in highly complimentary terms on his elevation. The appointment was made by the unanimous vote of clergy, Roman emperor, and people. The letter of Maximianus announcing to the pope his succession is lost, but that to Cyril of Alexandria remains, with its high eulogium on Cyril&#x27;s constancy in defending the cause of Jesus.

It was the custom for occupants of the principal sees on election to send a synodical letter to the most considerable bishops of the Christian world, asking for the assurance of their communion. Maximianus sent his synodical to the Easterns as to the others. Communion was refused by bishop Helladius of Tarsus; and, we may conclude, by Eutherios of Tyana, Himerius of Nicomedia, and Dorotheus of Martianopolis, as Maximianus deposed them. Patriarch John I of Antioch approved the refusal of the bishop of Tarsus and praised him for having declined to insert the name of Maximianus in the diptychs of his church.

Maximianus&#x27;s earnest appeal for reunion continued. Pope Sixtus III wrote to him several times, urging him to extend his charity to all whom he could possibly regain. Maximianus spared no effort, and although he was in closest harmony with Saint Cyril, he pressed him strongly to give up his anathemas, which seemed an insurmountable obstacle to reunion. He even wrote to the emperor&#x27;s secretary Aristolaus the tribune, who was greatly interested in the question of peace, almost complaining that he did not press Cyril enough on the point, and to his archdeacon Epiphanius.

Harmony being restored, John of Antioch and the other Eastern bishops wrote Maximianus a letter of communion indicating their consent to his election and to the deposition of Nestorius. Cyril wrote to him, attributing the blessed result to the force of his prayers. A letter to Maximianus from Aristolaus, which Maximianus caused to be read in his church to his people, was pronounced spurious by Dorotheus of Martianopolis, evidently because it took the side of Maximianus so decidedly.

Maximianus died in office. Of all his letters, only that to Saint Cyril is extant.

<text>Wellington College, is a state-run boys secondary school in Wellington, New Zealand. It is situated on 12 hectares of green belt land in the suburb of Mount Victoria, in the vicinity of the Basin Reserve and Government House. The school was founded in 1867 through a deed of endowment from Sir George Grey, the then Governor of New Zealand.

Wellington College is one of the oldest boys&#x27; secondary schools in New Zealand. The history and influence of Wellington College have made it notable in the history of New Zealand, with prominent alumni such as Arthur Coningham, Bernard Freyberg and William Pickering. The school is known nationally for both its academic success, as well as a large number of sporting activities.

The school has an enrolment of about 1750 boys. Glen Denham is the current Headmaster.

== History ==

Wellington College opened in 1867 as Wellington Grammar School in Woodward Street, though Sir George Grey gave the school a deed of endowment in 1853. In 1869 the school moved to a new, spired, wooden building on the hills above the central city in Clifton Terrace from where it could be seen from many places in Wellington. In 1874 the college opened in a much larger building at its present location. The former boarding establishment at the College, Firth House, was named after Joseph Firth, the headmaster from 1892 to 1921. 

Wellington College&#x27;s Pavilion, Firth House, and the Gifford Observatory were opened on 1 December, 1924. The War Memorial Hall was opened on 2 March, 1928, financially supported by £6000 from the Old Boys&#x27; Association. The War Memorial Hall and classroom wings were demolished by the Ministry of Works and replaced in the 1960s with a new hall and seven-storey Tower classroom block due to its lack of earthquake reinforcements. The stained glass window from the front of the War Memorial Hall is now in the front of the existing hall.

In the 1960s the Old Boys Gymnasium was built on the eastern boundary of the campus replacing the swimming pool and during the 1970s the Maths, Library, and Technology blocks were opened, replacing the last of the War Memorial Hall building and classroom wings that opened in 1928.

In 1980 Firth House was demolished to make way for a new gymnasium which opened in 1982. 1988 saw the opening of the Arts and Music block, and the Brierley Theatre, named after old boy Ron Brierley.

The first dedicated computer rooms in the College opened in 1994 in a new building behind the school hall.

2001 saw the Science block&#x27;s opening on the western boundary of the campus. In 2008 the Languages block opened, also located on the west boundary.

The campus also has many prefabricated buildings, some functioning as offices or classrooms.

The only &quot;historical&quot; buildings remaining on campus to this day are Firth Hall, the Pavilion, and the Gifford Observatory.

In 2016, the College Hall was demolished to make way for a larger Assembly Hall and Performing Arts Centre, which would be able to hold the entire school with its growing population. In preparation for this, the staffroom was moved to Firth Hall, the Uniform Shop opened a new premise next to the Archives, and the Computer Block was opened on the first floor of Tower Block. Construction on the new hall commenced in September 2016 and was opened in 2018 by Jacinda Ardern.

==About==
Wellington College&#x27;s enrolment zone mainly covers the central and western suburbs of Wellington (Rongotai College serves the southeastern suburbs, and Onslow College the northern suburbs).

The school also competes in a local athletics competition known as &quot;McEvedy Shield&quot; along with St. Patrick&#x27;s College (Town), St. Patrick&#x27;s College (Silverstream) and Rongotai College. Historically, Wellington College has won the shield more than any other school.

It is next to Wellington East Girls&#x27; College, also in Mount Victoria, and shares with that college the Gifford Observatory. Although Wellington College is situated next to Wellington East Girls&#x27; College, its sister college is Wellington Girls&#x27; College located in Thorndon.

In 2011, 2012, and 2013, Wellington College earned the highest number of scholarships in the New Zealand scholarship exams.

==Board of trustees== 
The Wellington College Board of Trustees consists of twelve elected and appointed members.

Currently the Board Chair is Cameron Harland, who is also the Chief Executive at NZ On Air

<text>The following lists events that happened during 2001 in Afghanistan.

== Incumbents ==
* De facto head of state: Mohammed Omar (until 13 November)
* President: Burhanuddin Rabbani (until 22 December), Hamid Karzai (starting 22 December)
* Chief Justice: Faisal Ahmad Shinwari

== January ==
* January 1 – The Afghan Northern Alliance captured the Ghalmin district in Ghor province, Afghanistan. Several Taliban attempts to recapture the area failed. Retreating Taliban left five dead militants behind. Another 13 Taliban were reportedly wounded.
* Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan authorities in Afghanistan raised postal rates beyond affordable levels for the majority of ordinary citizens. Mulla Abdul Baqi Mukhles, head of the central postal department, said the rise was linked to the steep fall of the afghani and the decisions of the 1999 International Postal Union congress in Beijing.
* January 2 – In Ghor province, Afghanistan, Taliban fighter planes bombed the Ghalmin district in support of a two-pronged infantry attack in which two opposition soldiers were wounded and six militiamen killed.
* January 3 – Taliban forces pounded opposition positions with heavy artillery initiating a counter-attack to retake the Ghalmin district in Ghor province, Afghanistan.
* Fighting between the Taliban and opposition forces was reported in northeastern Afghanistan near the border with Tajikistan.
* A meeting held in head District of Bamyan province, Afghanistan was attended by a large number of the people including Ustad Akbari. Leaders denounced the conspiracies and plots of anti-Islamic states, including the United States and France.
* The United Nations announced that the number of its foreign workers returning to Afghanistan had reached 24, and would increase, but not go beyond 34. Less than two weeks earlier, the U.N. had pulled all of its workers from the nation to coincide with sanction activities.
* The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan announced it was allowing all humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations, to continue their operations, except for the offices of United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan.
* January 4 – A Chinese delegation of the Chinese OFEM company arrived in Kabul, Afghanistan to assist the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan with the revival of hydel power projects. The delegation met with Taliban Minister for Water and Power Maulvi Ahmed Jan, visited Sarobi Dam and pledged to install new turbine in the power house. The delegates also made commitment about the installation of mobile telephone system in Afghanistan.
* The Taliban admit that resistance forces have captured the strategically important town of Bamiyan after heavy fighting.
* January 5 – In Patras, Greece, while attempting to board a ship bound for Italy, more than 20 Iraqi Kurds clashed with 15 Afghans. Eight were injured and taken to a hospital for treatment. The rest were arrested by the authorities.
* Taliban leader Mohammad Omar decrees that religious conversion from Islam to any other faith will be punishable by death. Omar suggests that outside forces are attempting to undermine the Islamic regime by covertly preaching Christianity and Judaism in the country.
* Early January – The UNHCR expresses serious concern for some 10,000 Afghan refugees camping on the country&#x27;s northern border with Tajikistan.
* Mid-January – The International Red Cross (ICRC) announces that it will end its relief mission in Kabul, saying that the Afghan capital is no longer adversely affected by the country&#x27;s civil war. The 20,000 families that have been receiving aid from the ICRC since 1994 will be given their last shipment of cooking oil, rice, soap, and wheat in March.
* Mid-January – Supporters of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance reportedly retake the town of Yakawlang after heavy fighting. The UN reports that Taliban forces had killed around 100 civilians when they reentered the town in December 2000 after briefly losing control of it. The UN also says that large numbers of refugees have fled the town despite the severe winter weather.
* January 22 – The Taliban regime reveals Afghanistan&#x27;s revamped air traffic control system, marking the first major improvement in the country&#x27;s infrastructure for years. The upgrade is likely to increase the amount of air traffic flying over Afghanistan in future.
* Late January – 110 internal refugees sheltering in the west of the country die in one night as temperatures drop to −25 °C.
* Late January – The UN World Food Program (WFP) warns that the level of malnutrition among children in the north of the country is alarming.

== February ==
* February 14 – The headquarters of the UN Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA) are closed by the Taliban authorities in retaliation for the U.S. government&#x27;s closure of the Taliban offices in New York.
* Mid-February – The UK-based human rights group Amnesty International condemns the apparently summary execution of six men by the rebel Northern Alliance.
* The New York-based Human Rights Watch produces video evidence of the murder of around 170 men by Taliban forces in December 2000. The footage shows the execution of local men rounded up by Taliban forces reentering the town of Yakawlang, which had been briefly held by rebel forces late in 2000. It also depicts a mass grave at a nearby village.
* Late February – In response to allegations of atrocities the Taliban authorities accuse rebel forces of killing 120 civilians during their three-day occupation of Bamiyan earlier in the month.
* Taliban leader Mohammad Omar decrees that all statues in the country should be destroyed as they represent an insult to Islam and are being worshipped as false gods. The order leads to the destruction of priceless historic artifacts across the country including the world&#x27;s tallest statue of an upright Buddha in Bamiyan.

== March ==
* March 2 – The Taliban begins the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan, causing worldwide condemnation.
* Despite UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan&#x27;s reassurances in early March that the plight of the hundreds of thousands of internal refugees has not been forgotten by the international community, the UN withholds its aid to refugees stranded on the border with neighbouring Tajikistan later in the month. The suspension comes amid fears that the aid was being subverted by armed groups. Just a day before the announcement Annan urged both sides in the country&#x27;s civil war to reject further violence.
* An article published in March 2001 by &quot;Jane&#x27;s&quot; suggests that the United States was giving the Northern Alliance information and logistics support as part of concerted action with India, Iran, and Russia against Afghanistan&#x27;s Taliban regime, with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan being used as bases.

== April ==
* Early April – former communist general Abdul Rashid Dostum returns from self-exile in Turkey to boost resistance to the Taliban regime. He was forced to flee the country after his stronghold in the north was attacked by Taliban forces in 1998. He meets with his former bitter enemy, the senior commander of anti-Taliban forces, Ahmad Shah Massoud, to discuss plans for a new northern front. Morale among opposition forces is reported to have been boosted by Dostum&#x27;s return. The meeting is reported to have taken place in the Panjshir valley in the province of Badakhshan, the only part of Afghanistan under full opposition control.
* April 16 – The chair of the Taliban Interim Council, Mohammad Rabbani, dies. He was fighting liver cancer in a hospital in neighbouring Pakistan. His body is repatriated to Kandahar by a UN plane, permitted to operate on humanitarian grounds despite the air embargo.
* April 17 – The second of five rounds of polio immunizations to be held this year begins after the Taliban and the Afghan Northern Alliance agreed to a week-long ceasefire. The ceasefire enables tens of thousands of staff and volunteers to operate freely to carry out a house-to-house effort to immunize all children under five years of age.
* April 18 – The European Union announces that it has signed a contract with the World Food Programme to contribute humanitarian aid worth U.S. $900,000 to Afghanistan.
* April 19 – In an effort to find out how western aid is being used, three U.S. officials complete a rare visit to Afghanistan.
* April 24 – The UN declares the Afghan people the most displaced in the world. It estimates that there are 700,000 internal refugees in Afghanistan as well as at least 100,000 abroad. Aid workers also voice concern at the health situation in refugee camps and warn of impending epidemics.

== May ==
* Early May – The anti-Taliban alliance claims to have taken control of key settlements in the eastern Kunar province, northeast of Kabul. The Taliban regime denies the claims and counters that its forces have repelled a brief occupation of the central town of Yakawlang, near Bamiyan.
* May 17 – The U.S. announces that it will extend a $43 million aid package direct to projects and facilities in Afghanistan, bypassing the Taliban regime. The offer comes amid spiraling fears of impending famine.
* May 20 – The Taliban regime closes the UN offices in Herat, Jalalabad, Kandahar, and Mazar-e-Sharif in protest over UN sanctions.
* Late May – Afghan Hindus are ordered to wear yellow identity labels to differentiate themselves from their Muslim neighbours. Although the Taliban regime claims that the plan is to protect Hindus from persecution by religious police, Hindu groups complain that the labels amount to &quot;patent discrimination.&quot;
* The Taliban authorities ban female aid workers from driving. Although the edict is unlikely to affect larger aid groups it is feared it may hinder the work of small-scale operations.

== June ==
* June 1 – Taliban forces begin a fresh attack on opposition positions in the centre and the northeastern Takhar province, around Taloqan.

== November ==
* November 8 – Pakistan, being the only nation that still had diplomatic ties to the Taliban, asked Afghanistan&#x27;s rulers to close their consulate in the city of Karachi.

: Three Japanese warships with several hundred sailors left port for the Indian Ocean. The goal was to provide the U.S.-led forces with non-combat military support. This was Japan&#x27;s first mission of this kind since World War II.

: Prime minister Wim Kok of the Netherlands announced that 1000 soldiers would join the efforts of the war against terrorism.
* November 10 – The Taliban and Northern Alliance fighters both claimed that the strategic northern Afghan city of Mazari Sharif was taken by Northern Alliance fighters.
* November 12 – Taliban forces abandon Kabul ahead of advancing Northern Alliance troops. Iranian forces aligned with the Coalition capture Herat.
* November 13 – Northern Alliance fighters take over Kabul, the Afghan capital, thereby gaining control of virtually all of northern Afghanistan.
* November 25 – Northern Alliance gained control of Kunduz, the last Taliban stronghold in Northern Afghanistan, but only after Pakistani aircraft rescued several thousand Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters and their military advisers. The Taliban then controlled less than 25% of the country, mainly around Kandahar in the south.

* December 4 – Scott Peterson, writing in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, quoted a defector he described as the
Taliban deputy interior minister, and &quot;highest ranking Taliban defector to date&quot;.
According to Peterson this defector described the American bombardment as very effective, &quot;Kabul city has seen many rockets, but this was a different thing&quot; and &quot;the American bombing of Taliban trenches, cars, and troops caused us to be defeated. All ways were blocked, so there was no way to carry food or ammunition to the front. All trenches of the Taliban were destroyed, and many people were killed.&quot;
* December 6 – Mullah Omar began to signal that he was ready to surrender Kandahar to tribal forces. His forces were by now broken by heavy U.S. bombing, and he was living constantly on the run within Kandahar to avoid becoming a target. Recognizing that he could not hold on to Kandahar much longer, he began signaling a willingness in negotiations to turn the city over to the tribal leaders, assuming that he and his top men received some protection.
* December 17 – The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is overthrown by the US and Northern Alliance during the Battle of Tora Bora.
* December 18 – According to a December 18, 2001, article published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the US and Northern Alliance had started to diverge over the American aerial policy.

The article quoted a senior American military official, who stated:
* December 20 – United Nations Security Council Resolution 1386 on December 20, 2001, supported &quot;international efforts to root out terrorism, in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations, and reaffirming also its resolutions 1368 (2001) of September 12, 2001, and 1373 (2001) of September 28, 2001&quot; and subsequently established the International Security Assistance Force.

<text>In the material culture of classical antiquity, a patera () or phiale ( ) is a shallow ceramic or metal libation bowl. It often has a bulbous indentation (&quot;omphalos&quot;, &quot;belly button&quot;) in the center underside to facilitate holding it, in which case it is sometimes called a mesomphalic phiale. It typically has no handles, and no feet.

Although the two terms may be used interchangeably, particularly in the context of Etruscan culture, &quot;phiale&quot; is more common in reference to Greek forms, and &quot;patera&quot; in Roman settings. The form should be distinguished from a drinking cup with handles, and often a stem, of which the most common type is called a &quot;kylix&quot;, and a circular platter with a pair of C-handles is not a &quot;patera&quot;, though a few &quot;paterae&quot; have single long straight handles (see &quot;trulla&quot; below).

==Use==
Libation was a central and vital aspect of ancient Greek religion, and one of the simplest and most common forms of religious practice. It is one of the basic religious acts that define piety in ancient Greece, dating back to the Bronze Age and even prehistoric Greece. Libations were a part of daily life, and the pious might perform them every day in the morning and evening, as well as to begin meals. A libation most often consisted of mixed wine and water, but could also be unmixed wine, honey, oil, water, or milk.

The form of libation called &quot;spondē&quot; is typically the ritualized pouring of wine from a jug or bowl held in the hand. The most common ritual was to pour the liquid from an &quot;oinochoē&quot; (wine jug) into a &quot;phiale&quot;. Libation generally accompanied prayer. The Greeks stood when they prayed, either with their arms uplifted, or in the act of libation with the right arm extended to hold the &quot;phiale&quot;. After the wine offering was poured from the &quot;phiale&quot;, the remainder of the contents was drunk by the celebrant.

In Roman art, the libation is shown performed at an altar, &quot;mensa&quot; (sacrificial meal table), or tripod. It was the simplest form of sacrifice, and could be a sufficient offering by itself. The introductory rite (&quot;praefatio&quot;) to an animal sacrifice included an incense and wine libation onto a burning altar. Both emperors and divinities are frequently depicted, especially on coins, pouring libations from a &quot;patera&quot;. Scenes of libation and the &quot;patera&quot; itself commonly signify the quality of &quot;pietas&quot;, religious duty or reverence.

==Handled pans==
In Roman contexts &quot;patera&quot; is sometimes used for what is normally called a &quot;trulla&quot;. These are deep round pans with a single flat handle, for cooking and serving food. The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan is an example, although it has lost its handle.

==Architecture==
In architecture, oval features on plaster friezes on buildings may be called &quot;paterae&quot; (plural).

<text>The Edelweiss Pirates ( ) were a loosely organized group of youths opposed to the status quo of Nazi Germany. They emerged in western Germany out of the German Youth Movement of the late 1930s in response to the strict regimentation of the Hitler Youth. Similar in many ways to the &quot;Leipzig Meuten&quot;, they consisted of young people, mainly between the ages of 14 and 17, who had evaded the Hitler Youth by leaving school (which was allowed at 14) and were also young enough to avoid military conscription, which was only compulsory from the age of 17 onward. The roots and background of the Edelweiss Pirates movement were detailed in the 2004 film &quot;Edelweiss Pirates&quot;, directed by Niko von Glasow.

==History==
The origins of the Edelweißpiraten can be traced to the period immediately prior to World War II, as the state-controlled Hitler Youth (&quot;Hitler-Jugend&quot;) was mobilized to indoctrinate young people, at the expense of the leisure activities previously offered to them. This tension was exacerbated once the war began and youth leaders were conscripted. In contrast, the Edelweißpiraten offered young people considerable freedom to express themselves and to mingle with members of the opposite sex. This was unlike Nazi youth movements, which were strictly segregated by sex, the Hitler Youth being for boys and the League of German Girls (&quot;Bund Deutscher Mädel&quot;) for girls. Although predominantly male, the Edelweißpiraten consisted of both male and female members. The Edelweißpiraten used many symbols of the outlawed German Youth Movement, including their tent (the &quot;Kohte&quot;), their style of clothing (the &quot;&quot;), and their songs.

The first Edelweißpiraten appeared in the late 1930s in western Germany, comprising mostly young people between 14 and 18. Individual groups were closely associated with different regions but were identifiable by a common style of dress with their own edelweiss badge and by their opposition to what they saw as the paramilitary nature of the Hitler Youth. Subgroups of the Edelweißpiraten included the &quot;Navajos&quot;, centered on Cologne, the &quot;Kittelbach Pirates&quot; of Oberhausen and Düsseldorf, and the &quot;Roving Dudes&quot; of Essen. According to one Nazi official in 1941, &quot;Every child knows who the Kittelbach Pirates are. They are everywhere; there are more of them than there are Hitler Youth... They beat up the patrols... They never take no for an answer.&quot;

Although they rejected the Nazis&#x27; authoritarianism, the Edelweißpiraten″s nonconformist behaviour tended to be restricted to petty provocations. Despite this, they represented a group of youth who rebelled against the government&#x27;s regimentation of leisure and were unimpressed by the propaganda touting &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; (people&#x27;s community).

During the war, many Edelweißpiraten supported the Allies and assisted deserters from the German Army. Some groups also collected propaganda leaflets dropped by Allied aircraft and pushed them through letterboxes.

Apart from gatherings on street corners, the Edelweißpiraten engaged in hiking and camping trips, defying the restrictions on free movement, which kept them away from the prying eyes of the totalitarian regime. They were highly antagonistic to the Hitler Youth, ambushing their patrols and taking great pride in beating them up. One of their slogans was &quot;Eternal War on the Hitler Youth&quot;. As one subgroup, the Navajos, sang:
===Nazi response===
The Nazi response to the Edelweißpiraten was relatively slight before the war, because they were viewed as a minor irritant and did not fit in with the policy of selective terror. As the war went on, and some Pirates&#x27; activities became more extreme, so did the punishments meted out. Individuals identified by the Gestapo as belonging to the various gangs were often rounded up and released with their heads shaved to shame them. In some cases, young people were sent to concentration camps specifically organized for youths, or temporarily detained in regular prison. On 25 October 1944, Heinrich Himmler ordered a crackdown on the group, and in November of that year, a group of thirteen people, the heads of the &quot;Ehrenfelder Gruppe&quot;, were publicly hanged in Cologne. Some of these were former Edelweißpiraten. The Edelweißpiraten hanged included six teenagers, among them Bartholomäus Schink, called &quot;Barthel&quot;, former member of the local Navajos. Fritz Theilen survived.

Nevertheless, government repression never managed to break the spirit of most groups, which constituted a subculture that rejected the norms of Nazi society. While the Edelweißpiraten assisted army deserters and others hiding from the Third Reich, they have yet to receive recognition as a resistance movement (partly because they were viewed with contempt by many of their former Youth Movement comrades because of their &quot;proletarian&quot; backgrounds and &quot;criminal&quot; activities), and the families of members killed by the Nazis have as yet received no reparations.

===Post-World War II===
Contrary to what the Allies had hoped, the Edelweißpiraten were neither pro-British nor pro-American. In the early days of the Allied occupation, they sought contact with the occupying authority to intervene on behalf of friends, and even to propose that they might go on patrol, as did the Wuppertal Edelweißpiraten. They were taken seriously and courted by various factions; the first known pamphlets of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), in July 1945, were directed at them.

While a small number of Edelweißpiraten remained in the Antifascist Youth and the Free German Youth organizations, the majority turned their backs on these bodies as soon as they realized that, in the words of one member, &quot;politics were taking centre stage again&quot;. For example, a group in Bergisch Gladbach disbanded when young people of communist orientation tried to form a majority in the group.

The Edelweißpiraten&#x27;s turning away from the re-authorized political youth groups forced them into the role of social outcasts and brought them into conflict with the Allies. The headquarters of the American Counter-Intelligence Corps in Frankfurt reported in May 1946 that Edelweiß activities were known throughout the British and American Zones. 
Groups identifying themselves as Edelweißpiraten conducted many violent attacks against Soviet Russian and Polish displaced persons. Author Peter Schult witnessed such an attack against a Polish black marketeer. There were also attacks against German women who were known to have been friends or been intimate with British soldiers.

In a trial held by a military court at Uelzen in April 1946, a juvenile named as &quot;Heinz D.&quot; was initially sentenced to death, for his &quot;very active part in carrying out the nefarious schemes of the E. Piraten. An organization such as this might well threaten the peace of Europe.&quot; The sentence was commuted the following month to a prison term. In the Soviet Zone, young people suspected of being Edelweißpiraten were sentenced to a virtually obligatory 25 years in prison.

Controversy surrounded the claims that the group were &quot;Widerstandskämpfer&quot; (resistance fighters) after one member, Fritz Theilen, published his memoirs in 1984, leading to several legal battles that Theilen won. In April 2011, Cologne&#x27;s mayor, Jürgen Roters, presented Theilen and four other survivors, including Gertrud Koch, the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.

<text>Fieldwork is a 2007 novel by American journalist Mischa Berlinski. It was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux and was a finalist that year for the National Book Award, eventually losing out to Denis Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Tree of Smoke&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Set in Thailand, the novel is told from the point of view of a fictional narrator named Mischa Berlinski. It tells the story of a tribe called the Dyalo, a family of Protestant missionaries attempting to convert them to Christianity, and an anthropologist who is studying the tribe and who murders one of the missionaries and then commits suicide in prison.

==Reception==
The book received strongly positive reviews. In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Tim Rutten called the book &quot;a notable piece of first fiction -- at once deeply serious about questions of consequence and refreshingly mindful of traditional storytelling conventions.&quot; (Rutten did criticize what he called the author&#x27;s &quot;casual obeisance to fashionable postmodernism&quot; in choosing to use his name for the fictional narrator.) Lara Tupper, in &quot;The Believer&quot;, described it as &quot;a clever book, chock-full of David Foster Wallace–esque footnotes and moments of direct address.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot;&#x27;s Boyd Tonkin described it as &quot;an updated Somerset Maugham yarn&quot;, &quot;[l]ush in its landscapes, dense in its ideas, always startlingly nimble and witty&quot;.

A less positive review came from Sophia Asare of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, who gave the book a B-minus grade, calling it &quot;a rich yet cumbersome travelogue&quot;. However, a second &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; article about the book, written by Stephen King and entitled &quot;How to Bury a Book&quot;, was more laudatory: &quot;This is a great story. It has an exotic locale, mystery, and a narrative voice full of humor and sadness. Reading Fieldwork is like discovering an unpublished Robertson Davies novel; as with Davies, you can&#x27;t stop reading until midnight (good), and you don&#x27;t hate yourself in the morning (better).&quot; King went on to criticize the publisher for its choice of a bland title and cover design, asking, &quot;Why, why, why would a company publish a book this good and then practically demand that people not read it? Why should this book go to waste?&quot; King&#x27;s column yielded additional attention and sales for &quot;Fieldwork&quot;; when Berlinski was awarded a 2008 Whiting Writers&#x27; Award, he commented to an interviewer about his &quot;luck&quot; that &quot;Stephen King, the most famous writer in the world, picked up my book because he didn&#x27;t like the cover.&quot;

<text>The Los Angeles Times is a daily newspaper that began publishing in Los Angeles, California, in 1881. Based in the Greater Los Angeles city of El Segundo since 2018, it is the sixth-largest newspaper in the nation and the largest in the Western United States with a print circulation of 118,760. It has 500,000 online subscribers, the fifth-largest among U.S. newspapers. Owned by Patrick Soon-Shiong and published by California Times, the paper has won over 40 Pulitzer Prizes since its founding.

In the 19th century, the paper developed a reputation for civic boosterism and opposition to labor unions, the latter of which led to the bombing of its headquarters in 1910. The paper&#x27;s profile grew substantially in the 1960s under publisher Otis Chandler, who adopted a more national focus. As with other regional newspapers in California and the United States, the paper&#x27;s readership has declined since 2010. It has also been beset by a series of ownership changes, staff reductions, and other controversies.

In January 2018, the paper&#x27;s staff voted to unionize and finalized their first union contract on October 16, 2019. The paper moved out of its historic headquarters in downtown Los Angeles to a facility in El Segundo, near Los Angeles International Airport, in July 2018. Since 2020, the newspaper&#x27;s coverage has evolved away from national and international news and toward coverage of California and especially Southern California news.

In January 2024, the paper underwent its largest percentage reduction in headcount—amounting to a layoff of over 20%, including senior staff editorial positions—in an effort to stem the tide of financial losses and maintain enough cash to be viably operational through the end of the year in a struggle for survival and relevance as a regional newspaper of diminished status.

==History==
===Otis era===

The &quot;Times&quot; was first published on December 4, 1881, as the &quot;Los Angeles Daily Times&quot;, under the direction of Nathan Cole Jr. and Thomas Gardiner. It was first printed at the &quot;Mirror&quot; printing plant, owned by Jesse Yarnell and T. J. Caystile. Unable to pay the printing bill, Cole and Gardiner turned the paper over to the Mirror Company. In the meantime, S. J. Mathes had joined the firm, and it was at his insistence that the &quot;Times&quot; continued publication. In July 1882, Harrison Gray Otis moved from Santa Barbara, California to become the paper&#x27;s editor. At the same time he also purchased a 1/4 stake in the paper for $6,000 mostly secured on a bank loan.

Historian Kevin Starr wrote that Otis was a businessman &quot;capable of manipulating the entire apparatus of politics and public opinion for his own enrichment&quot;. Otis&#x27;s editorial policy was based on civic boosterism, extolling the virtues of Los Angeles and promoting its growth. Toward those ends, the paper supported efforts to expand the city&#x27;s water supply by acquiring the rights to the water supply of the distant Owens Valley.

The efforts of the &quot;Times&quot; to fight local unions led to the bombing of its headquarters on October 1, 1910, killing 21 people. Two of the union leaders, James and Joseph McNamara, were charged. The American Federation of Labor hired noted trial attorney Clarence Darrow to represent the brothers, who eventually pleaded guilty.

Otis fastened a bronze eagle on top of a high frieze of the new &quot;Times&quot; headquarters building designed by Gordon Kaufmann, proclaiming anew the credo written by his wife, Eliza: &quot;Stand Fast, Stand Firm, Stand Sure, Stand True&quot;.

===Chandler era===

After Otis&#x27; death in 1917, his son-in-law and the paper&#x27;s business manager, Harry Chandler, took control as publisher of the &quot;Times&quot;. Chandler was succeeded in 1944 by his son, Norman Chandler, who ran the paper during the rapid growth in Los Angeles following the end of World War II. Norman&#x27;s wife, Dorothy Buffum Chandler, became active in civic affairs and led the effort to build the Los Angeles Music Center, whose main concert hall was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in her honor. Family members are buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery near Paramount Studios. The site also includes a memorial to the Times Building bombing victims.

In 1935, the newspaper moved to a new, landmark Art Deco building, the Los Angeles Times Building, to which the newspaper would add other facilities until taking up the entire city block between Spring, Broadway, First and Second streets, which came to be known as Times Mirror Square and would house the paper until 2018. Harry Chandler, then the president and general manager of Times-Mirror Co., declared the Los Angeles Times Building a &quot;monument to the progress of our city and Southern California&quot;.

The fourth generation of family publishers, Otis Chandler, held that position from 1960 till 1980. Otis Chandler sought legitimacy and recognition for his family&#x27;s paper, often forgotten in the power centers of the Northeastern United States due to its geographic and cultural distance. He sought to remake the paper in the model of the nation&#x27;s most respected newspapers, such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Believing that the newsroom was &quot;the heartbeat of the business&quot;, Otis Chandler increased the size and pay of the reporting staff and expanded its national and international reporting. In 1962, the paper joined with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to form the Los Angeles Times–Washington Post News Service to syndicate articles from both papers for other news organizations. He also toned down the unyielding conservatism that had characterized the paper over the years, adopting a much more centrist editorial stance.

During the 1960s, the paper won four Pulitzer Prizes, more than its previous nine decades combined.

In 2013, &quot;Times&quot; reporter Michael Hiltzik wrote that:

The first generations bought or founded their local paper for profits and also social and political influence (which often brought more profits). Their children enjoyed both profits and influence, but as the families grew larger, the later generations found that only one or two branches got the power, and everyone else got a share of the money. Eventually the coupon-clipping branches realized that they could make more money investing in something other than newspapers. Under their pressure the companies went public, or split apart, or disappeared. That&#x27;s the pattern followed over more than a century by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; under the Chandler family.
The paper&#x27;s early history and subsequent transformation was chronicled in an unauthorized history, &quot;Thinking Big&quot; (1977, ), and was one of four organizations profiled by David Halberstam in &quot;The Powers That Be&quot; (1979, ; 2000 reprint ). Between the 1960s and the mid-2000s it was also the whole or partial subject of nearly thirty dissertations in communications and social science.

===Former &quot;Times&quot; buildings===

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; has occupied five physical sites beginning in 1881.

===Modern era===
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was beset in the first decade of the 21st century by changes in ownership, a bankruptcy, a rapid succession of editors, reductions in staff, decreases in paid circulation, the need to increase its Web presence, and a series of controversies. In January 2024, the newsroom announced a roughly 20 percent reduction in staff, due to anemic subscription growth and other financial struggles.

The newspaper moved to a new headquarters building in El Segundo, near Los Angeles International Airport, in July 2018.

====Ownership====
In 2000, Times Mirror Company, publisher of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, was purchased by the Tribune Company of Chicago, Illinois, placing the paper in co-ownership with the then WB-affiliated (now CW-affiliated) KTLA, which Tribune acquired in 1985.

On April 2, 2007, the Tribune Company announced its acceptance of real estate entrepreneur Sam Zell&#x27;s offer to buy the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and all other company assets. Zell announced that he would sell the Chicago Cubs baseball club. He put up for sale the company&#x27;s 25 percent interest in Comcast SportsNet Chicago. Until shareholder approval was received, Los Angeles billionaires Ron Burkle and Eli Broad had the right to submit a higher bid, in which case Zell would have received a $25 million buyout fee.

In December 2008, the Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy was a result of declining advertising revenue and a debt load of $12.9 billion, much of it incurred when the paper was taken private by Zell.

On February 7, 2018, Tribune Publishing, formerly Tronc Inc., agreed to sell the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and its two other Southern California newspapers, &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; and &quot;Hoy&quot;, to billionaire biotech investor Patrick Soon-Shiong. The sale to Soon-Shiong through his Nant Capital investment fund, for $500 million plus the assumption of $90 million in pension liabilities, closed on June 16, 2018.

====Editorial changes and staff reductions====
In 2000, John Carroll, former editor of the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot;, was brought in to restore the luster of the newspaper. During his reign at the &quot;Times&quot;, he eliminated more than 200 jobs, but despite an operating profit margin of 20 percent, the Tribune executives were unsatisfied with returns, and by 2005 Carroll had left the newspaper. His successor, Dean Baquet, refused to impose the additional cutbacks mandated by the Tribune Company.

Baquet was the first African-American to hold this type of editorial position at a top-tier daily. During Baquet and Carroll&#x27;s time at the paper, it won 13 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other paper except &quot;The New York Times&quot;. However, Baquet was removed from the editorship for not meeting the demands of the Tribune Group—as was publisher Jeffrey Johnson—and was replaced by James O&#x27;Shea of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. O&#x27;Shea himself left in January 2008 after a budget dispute with publisher David Hiller.

The paper reported on July 3, 2008, that it planned to cut 250 jobs by Labor Day and reduce the number of published pages by 15 percent. That included about 17 percent of the news staff, as part of the newly private media company&#x27;s mandate to reduce costs. Hiller himself resigned on July 14. In January 2009, the &quot;Times&quot; eliminated the separate California/Metro section, folding it into the front section of the newspaper, and also announced seventy job cuts in news and editorial or a 10 percent cut in payroll.

In September 2015, Austin Beutner, the publisher and chief executive, was replaced by Timothy E. Ryan. On October 5, 2015, the Poynter Institute reported that &quot;″At least 50&#x27; editorial positions will be culled from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&quot; through a buyout. Nancy Cleeland, who took O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s buyout offer, did so because of &quot;frustration with the paper&#x27;s coverage of working people and organized labor&quot; (the beat that earned her Pulitzer). She speculated that the paper&#x27;s revenue shortfall could be reversed by expanding coverage of economic justice topics, which she believed were increasingly relevant to Southern California; she cited the paper&#x27;s attempted hiring of a &quot;celebrity justice reporter&quot; as an example of the wrong approach.

On August 21, 2017, Ross Levinsohn, then aged 54, was named publisher and CEO, replacing Davan Maharaj, who had been both publisher and editor. On June 16, 2018, the same day the sale to Patrick Soon-Shiong closed, Norman Pearlstine was named executive editor.

On May 3, 2021, the newspaper announced that it had selected Kevin Merida to be the new executive editor. Merida was then a senior vice president at ESPN and headed &quot;The Undefeated&quot;, a site focused on sports, race, and culture; he had previously been the first Black managing editor at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Olympic Boulevard printing press was not purchased by Soon-Shiong and was kept by Tribune; in 2016 it was sold to developers who planned to build sound stages on the site. It had opened in 1990 and could print 70,000 96-page newspapers an hour. The last issue of the &quot;Times&quot; printed at Olympic Boulevard was the March 11, 2024, edition. Printing moved to Riverside, at the Southern California News Group&#x27;s &quot;Press-Enterprise&quot; printer, which also prints Southern California editions of the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;.

In preparation for the printing plant closure and with a refocusing of sports coverage for editorial reasons, daily game coverage and box scores were eliminated on July 9, 2023. The sports section now features less time-sensitive articles, billed as similar to a magazine. The change caused some consternation in the Los Angeles Jewish community, for many of whom reading box scores was a morning Shabbat ritual.

On January 23, 2024, the newspaper announced a layoff that would affect at least 115 employees. It named Terry Tang its next executive editor on April 8, 2024.

====Circulation====

The &quot;Times&quot; has suffered continued decline in distribution. Reasons offered for the circulation drop included a price increase and a rise in the proportion of readers preferring to read the online version instead of the print version. Editor Jim O&#x27;Shea, in an internal memo announcing a May 2007, mostly voluntary, reduction in force, characterized the decrease in circulation as an &quot;industry-wide problem&quot; which the paper had to counter by &quot;growing rapidly on-line&quot;, &quot;break[ing] news on the Web and explain[ing] and analyz[ing] it in our newspaper.&quot;

The &quot;Times&quot; closed its San Fernando Valley printing plant in early 2006, leaving press operations to the Olympic plant and to Orange County. Also that year the paper announced its circulation had fallen to 851,532, down 5.4 percent from 2005. The &quot;Times&quot;″s loss of circulation was the largest of the top ten newspapers in the U.S. Some observers believed that the drop was due to the retirement of circulation director Bert Tiffany. Others thought the decline was a side effect of a succession of short-lived editors who were appointed by publisher Mark Willes after publisher Otis Chandler relinquished day-to-day control in 1995. Willes, the former president of General Mills, was criticized for his lack of understanding of the newspaper business, and was derisively referred to by reporters and editors as &quot;The Cereal Killer&quot;. Subsequently, the Orange County plant closed in 2010.

The &quot;Times&quot;″s reported daily circulation in October 2010 was 600,449, down from a peak of 1,225,189 daily and 1,514,096 Sunday in April 1990.

====Internet presence and free weeklies ====
In December 2006, a team of &quot;Times&quot; reporters delivered management with a critique of the paper&#x27;s online news efforts known as the Spring Street Project. The report, which condemned the &quot;Times&quot; as a &quot;web-stupid&quot; organization, was followed by a shakeup in management of the paper&#x27;s website, and a rebuke of print staffers who were described as treating &quot;change as a threat.&quot;

On July 10, 2007, the &quot;Times&quot; launched a local Metromix site targeting live entertainment for young adults. A free weekly tabloid print edition of Metromix Los Angeles followed in February 2008; the publication was the newspaper&#x27;s first stand-alone print weekly. In 2009, the &quot;Times&quot; shut down Metromix and replaced it with &quot;Brand X&quot;, a blog site and free weekly tabloid targeting young, social networking readers. &quot;Brand X&quot; launched in March 2009; the &quot;Brand X&quot; tabloid ceased publication in June 2011 and the website was shut down the following month.

In May 2018, the &quot;Times&quot; blocked access to its online edition from most of Europe because of the European Union&#x27;s General Data Protection Regulation.

==== Gaza war ====
An analysis by The Intercept found that major Los Angeles Times exhibited a consistent bias against Palestinians in their coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza. These outlets disproportionately emphasized Israeli deaths, used emotive language to describe Israeli casualties but not Palestinian ones, and focused more on antisemitism in the U.S. than on anti-Muslim racism. The study, which examined over 1,000 articles from the first six weeks of the war, found that Israeli narratives were overwhelmingly favored. Despite the high Palestinian death toll, including thousands of children and journalists, their suffering was underreported and dehumanized compared to coverage of similar events in other conflicts, such as Ukraine. The bias in media representation influences public perception and U.S. political support for Israel, even as younger audiences increasingly turn to social media for alternative narratives.

====Other controversies====
In 1999, it was revealed that a revenue-sharing arrangement was in place between the &quot;Times&quot; and Staples Center in the preparation of a 168-page magazine about the opening of the sports arena. The magazine&#x27;s editors and writers were not informed of the agreement, which breached the Chinese wall that traditionally has separated advertising from journalistic functions at American newspapers. Publisher Mark Willes also had not prevented advertisers from pressuring reporters in other sections of the newspaper to write stories favorable to their point of view.
Michael Kinsley was hired as the Opinion and Editorial (op-ed) Editor in April 2004 to help improve the quality of the opinion pieces. His role was controversial, for he forced writers to take a more decisive stance on issues. In 2005, he created a Wikitorial, the first Wiki by a major news organization. Although it failed, readers could combine forces to produce their own editorial pieces. It was shut down after being besieged with inappropriate material. He resigned later that year.

In 2003, the &quot;Times&quot; drew fire for a last-minute story before the California recall election alleging that gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger groped scores of women during his movie career. Columnist Jill Stewart wrote on the &quot;American Reporter&quot; website that the &quot;Times&quot; did not do a story on allegations that former Governor Gray Davis had verbally and physically abused women in his office, and that the Schwarzenegger story relied on a number of anonymous sources. Further, she said, four of the six alleged victims were not named. She also said that in the case of the Davis allegations, the &quot;Times&quot; decided against printing the Davis story because of its reliance on anonymous sources. The American Society of Newspaper Editors said that the &quot;Times&quot; lost more than 10,000 subscribers because of the negative publicity surrounding the Schwarzenegger article.

On November 12, 2005, new op-ed editor Andrés Martinez announced the dismissal of liberal op-ed columnist Robert Scheer and conservative editorial cartoonist Michael Ramirez. The &quot;Times&quot; also came under controversy for its decision to drop the weekday edition of the &quot;Garfield&quot; comic strip in 2005, in favor of a hipper comic strip &quot;Brevity&quot;, while retaining it in the Sunday edition. &quot;Garfield&quot; was dropped altogether shortly thereafter.

Following the Republican Party&#x27;s defeat in the 2006 mid-term elections, an Opinion piece by Joshua Muravchik, a leading neoconservative and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, published on November 19, 2006, was titled &#x27;Bomb Iran&#x27;. The article shocked some readers, with its hawkish comments in support of more unilateral action by the United States, this time against Iran.

On March 22, 2007, editorial page editor Andrés Martinez resigned following an alleged scandal centering on his girlfriend&#x27;s professional relationship with a Hollywood producer who had been asked to guest-edit a section in the newspaper. In an open letter written upon leaving the paper, Martinez criticized the publication for allowing the Chinese wall between the news and editorial departments to be weakened, accusing news staffers of lobbying the opinion desk.

In November 2017, Walt Disney Studios blacklisted the &quot;Times&quot; from attending press screenings of its films, in retaliation for September 2017 reportage by the paper on Disney&#x27;s political influence in the Anaheim area. The company considered the coverage to be &quot;biased and inaccurate&quot;. As a sign of condemnation and solidarity, a number of major publications and writers, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Boston Globe&quot; critic Ty Burr, &quot;Washington Post&quot; blogger Alyssa Rosenberg, and the websites &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; and &quot;Flavorwire&quot;, announced that they would boycott press screenings of future Disney films. The National Society of Film Critics, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, New York Film Critics Circle, and Boston Society of Film Critics jointly announced that Disney&#x27;s films would be ineligible for their respective year-end awards unless the decision was reversed, condemning the decision as being &quot;antithetical to the principles of a free press and [setting] a dangerous precedent in a time of already heightened hostility towards journalists&quot;. On November 7, 2017, Disney reversed its decision, stating that the company &quot;had productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; regarding our specific concerns&quot;.

In October 2024, Soon-Shiong, the owner of the &quot;Times&quot;, told executive editor Terry Tang that the newspaper must not endorse a candidate in the 2024 United States presidential election, but should instead print &quot;a factual analysis of all the POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE policies by EACH candidate during their tenures at the White House, and how these policies affected the nation&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; editorial board, which had been preparing to endorse Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, rejected this alternative to endorsement, and after Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, alluded to the newspaper not having endorsed Harris, Mariel Garza, the editor of the opinion section, resigned in protest, as did two other members of the editorial board, Robert Greene and Karin Klein. Two hundred &quot;Times&quot; staff signed a letter condemning the way in which the non-endorsement was handled, and thousands of subscribers cancelled their subscriptions. Soon-Shiong had previously blocked an endorsement by the editorial board in 2020, when he overruled their decision to endorse Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.

Following the election, Soon-Shiong stated that he plans to add an AI-powered &quot;bias meter&quot; to all of the paper&#x27;s articles allowing readers to access &quot;both sides&quot; of stories. Amidst Soon-Shiong&#x27;s public display of support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump&#x27;s pick for leader of the US Department of Health and Human Services, opinion columnist Eric Reinhart alleged the paper cut a critical piece he wrote about Kennedy.

==Pulitzer Prizes==

As of 2014, the &quot;Times&quot; has won 41 Pulitzer Prizes, including four in editorial cartooning, and one each in spot news reporting for the 1965 Watts Riots and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
* The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; photographer John L. Gaunt Jr. won a 1955 &quot;Tragedy by the Sea&quot; &quot;(pictured)&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Photography. The image was published April 3, 1954.

* In 2019, three &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporters, Harriet Ryan, Matt Hamilton and Paul Pringle, won a Pulitzer Prize for their investigation into a gynecologist accused of abusing hundreds of students at the University of Southern California.

==Competition and rivalries==
In the 19th century, the chief competition to the &quot;Times&quot; was the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; followed by the smaller &quot;Los Angeles Tribune.&quot; In December 1903, newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst began publishing the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; as a direct morning competitor to the &quot;Times.&quot; In the 20th century, the &quot;Los Angeles Express&quot;, Manchester Boddy&#x27;s Los Angeles &quot;Daily News&quot;, a Democratic newspaper, were both afternoon competitors.

By the mid-1940s, the &quot;Times&quot; was the leading newspaper in terms of circulation in the Greater Los Angeles. In 1948, it launched the &quot;Los Angeles Mirror&quot;, an afternoon tabloid, to compete with both the &quot;Daily News&quot; and the merged &quot;Herald-Express&quot;. In 1954, the &quot;Mirror&quot; absorbed the &quot;Daily News&quot;. The combined paper, the &quot;Mirror-News&quot;, ceased publication in 1962, when the Hearst afternoon &quot;Herald-Express&quot; and the morning &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; merged to become the &quot;Herald-Examiner&quot;. The &quot;Herald-Examiner&quot; published its last number in 1989.

In 2014, the &quot;Los Angeles Register&quot;, published by Freedom Communications, then-parent company of the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;, was launched as a daily newspaper to compete with the &quot;Times&quot;. By late September of that year, however, the &quot;Los Angeles Register&quot; closed.

==Special editions==
===Midwinter and midsummer===
====Midwinter====
For 69 years, from 1885 until 1954, the &quot;Times&quot; issued on New Year&#x27;s Day a special annual Midwinter Number or Midwinter Edition that extolled the virtues of Southern California. At first, it was called the &quot;Trade Number&quot;, and in 1886 it featured a special press run of &quot;extra scope and proportions&quot;; that is, &quot;a twenty-four-page paper, and we hope to make it the finest exponent of this [Southern California] country that ever existed.&quot; Two years later, the edition had grown to &quot;forty-eight handsome pages (9×15 inches), [which] stitched for convenience and better preservation&quot;, was &quot;equivalent to a 150-page book.&quot; The last use of the phrase &quot;Trade Number&quot; was in 1895, when the edition had grown to thirty-six pages split among three separate sections.

The Midwinter Number drew acclamations from other newspapers, including this one from &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; in 1923:

In 1948, the Midwinter Edition, as it was then called, had grown to &quot;7 big picture magazines in beautiful rotogravure reproduction.&quot; The last mention of the Midwinter Edition was in a &quot;Times&quot; advertisement on January 10, 1954.

====Midsummer====
Between 1891 and 1895, the &quot;Times&quot; also issued a similar Midsummer Number, the first one featuring the theme, &quot;The Land and Its Fruits&quot;. Because of its issue date in September, the edition was in 1891 called the Midsummer Harvest Number.

===Zoned editions and subsidiaries===
In 1903, Pacific Wireless Telegraph Company established a radiotelegraph link between the California mainland and Santa Catalina Island. In the summer of that year, the &quot;Times&quot; made use of this link to establish a local daily paper, based in Avalon, &quot;The Wireless&quot;, which featured local news plus excerpts which had been transmitted via Morse code from the parent paper. However, this effort apparently survived for only a little more than one year.

In the 1990s, the &quot;Times&quot; published various editions catering to far-flung areas. Editions included those from the San Fernando Valley, Ventura County, Inland Empire, Orange County, San Diego County &amp; a &quot;National Edition&quot; that was distributed to Washington, D.C., and the San Francisco Bay Area. Overall, there were 14 editions succeeded by &quot;Our Times&quot;, a group of community supplements included in editions of the regular &quot;Los Angeles Metro&quot; newspaper, with the &quot;Our Times&quot; editions ceasing publication in 2000.

A subsidiary, Times Community Newspapers, publishes the &quot;Daily Pilot&quot; of Newport Beach and Costa Mesa. From 2011 to 2013, the &quot;Times&quot; had published the &quot;Pasadena Sun&quot;. It also had published the &quot;Glendale News-Press&quot; and &quot;Burbank Leader&quot; from 1993 to 2020, and the &quot;La Cañada Valley Sun&quot; from 2005 to 2020.

On April 30, 2020, Charlie Plowman, publisher of Outlook Newspapers, announced he would acquire the &quot;Glendale News-Press&quot;, &quot;Burbank Leader&quot; and &quot;La Cañada Valley Sun&quot; from Times Community Newspapers. Plowman acquired the &quot;South Pasadena Review&quot; and &quot;San Marino Tribune&quot; in late January 2020 from the Salter family, who owned and operated these two community weeklies.

==Features==
One of the &quot;Times&quot;″ features was &quot;Column One&quot;, a feature that appeared daily on the front page to the left-hand side. Established in September 1968, it was a place for the weird and the interesting; in the &quot;How Far Can a Piano Fly?&quot; (a compilation of Column One stories) introduction, Patt Morrison wrote that the column&#x27;s purpose was to elicit a &quot;Gee, that&#x27;s interesting, I didn&#x27;t know that&quot; type of reaction.

The &quot;Times&quot; also embarked on a number of investigative journalism pieces. A series in December 2004 on the King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles led to a Pulitzer Prize and a more thorough coverage of the hospital&#x27;s troubled history. Lopez wrote a five-part series on the civic and humanitarian disgrace of Los Angeles&#x27; Skid Row, which became the focus of a 2009 motion picture, &quot;The Soloist.&quot; The paper also won 75 awards at the 2020 Society for News Design (SND) awards for work completed in 2019.

From 1967 to 1972, the &quot;Times&quot; produced a Sunday supplement called &quot;West&quot; magazine. &quot;West&quot; was recognized for its art design, which was directed by Mike Salisbury (who later became art director of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine). From 2000 to 2012, the &quot;Times&quot; published the &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot;, which started as a weekly and then became a monthly supplement. The magazine focused on stories and photos of people, places, style, and other cultural affairs occurring in Los Angeles and its surrounding cities and communities. In 2014, &quot;The California Sunday Magazine&quot; was included in the Sunday &quot;L.A. Times&quot; edition, but stopped publishing in 2020.

In 2024, the &quot;Times&quot; published an &quot;L.A. Influential&quot; series, featuring the city&#x27;s most prominent moguls, artists, community leaders, and others. The feature is arranged in six categories, based on industry and other details.

==Promotion==
===Festival of Books===
In 1996, the &quot;Times&quot; started the annual Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, in association with the University of California, Los Angeles. It has panel discussions, exhibits, and stages during two days at the end of April each year. In 2011, the Festival of Books was moved to the University of Southern California.

===Book prizes===

Since 1980, the &quot;Times&quot; has awarded annual book prizes. The categories are now biography, current interest, fiction, first fiction, history, mystery/thriller, poetry, science and technology, and young adult fiction. In addition, the Robert Kirsch Award is presented annually to a living author with a substantial connection to the American West whose contribution to American letters deserves special recognition&quot;.

===Los Angeles Times Grand Prix===

From 1957 to 1987, the &quot;Times&quot; sponsored the Los Angeles Times Grand Prix that was held at the Riverside International Raceway in Moreno Valley, California.

==Other media==
===Book publishing ===
The Times Mirror Corporation has also owned a number of book publishers over the years, including New American Library, C.V. Mosby, Harry N. Abrams, Matthew Bender, and Jeppesen.

In 1960, Times Mirror of Los Angeles bought the book publisher New American Library, known for publishing affordable paperback reprints of classics and other scholarly works. The NAL continued to operate autonomously from New York and within the Mirror Company. In 1983, Odyssey Partners and Ira J. Hechler bought NAL from the Times Mirror Company for over $50 million.

In 1967, Times Mirror acquired C.V. Mosby Company, a professional publisher and merged it over the years with several other professional publishers including Resource Application, Inc., Year Book Medical Publishers, Wolfe Publishing Ltd., PSG Publishing Company, B.C. Decker, Inc., among others. Eventually in 1998 Mosby was sold to Harcourt Brace &amp; Company to form the Elsevier Health Sciences group.

===Broadcasting activities===

The Times-Mirror Company was a founding owner of television station KTTV in Los Angeles, which opened in January 1949. It became that station&#x27;s sole owner in 1951, after re-acquiring the minority shares it had sold to CBS in 1948. Times-Mirror also purchased a former motion picture studio, Nassour Studios, in Hollywood in 1950, which was then used to consolidate KTTV&#x27;s operations. Later to be known as Metromedia Square, the studio was sold along with KTTV to Metromedia in 1963.

After a seven-year hiatus from the medium, the firm reactivated Times-Mirror Broadcasting Company with its 1970 purchase of the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot; and its radio and television stations, KRLD-AM-FM-TV in Dallas. The Federal Communications Commission granted an exemption of its cross-ownership policy and allowed Times-Mirror to retain the newspaper and the television outlet, which was renamed KDFW-TV.

Times-Mirror Broadcasting later acquired KTBC-TV in Austin, Texas in 1973; and in 1980 purchased a group of stations owned by Newhouse Newspapers: WAPI-TV (now WVTM-TV) in Birmingham, Alabama; KTVI in St. Louis; WSYR-TV (now WSTM-TV) in Syracuse, New York and its satellite station WSYE-TV (now WETM-TV) in Elmira, New York; and WTPA-TV (now WHTM-TV) in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The company also entered the field of cable television, servicing the Phoenix and San Diego areas, amongst others. They were originally titled Times-Mirror Cable, and were later renamed to Dimension Cable Television. Similarly, they also attempted to enter the pay-TV market, with the Spotlight movie network; it was not successful and was quickly shut down. The cable systems were sold in the mid-1990s to Cox Communications.

Times-Mirror also pared its station group down, selling off the Syracuse, Elmira and Harrisburg properties in 1986. The remaining four outlets were packaged to a new upstart holding company, Argyle Television, in 1993. These stations were acquired by New World Communications shortly thereafter and became key components in a sweeping shift of network-station affiliations which occurred between 1994 and 1995.

==== Stations ====
Notes:
* 1 Co-owned with CBS until 1951 in a joint venture (51% owned by Times-Mirror, 49% owned by CBS);
* 2 Purchased along with KRLD-AM-FM as part of Times-Mirror&#x27;s acquisition of the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot;. Times-Mirror sold the radio stations to comply with FCC cross-ownership restrictions.

==Employees==
===Unionization===
On January 19, 2018, employees of the news department voted 248–44 in a National Labor Relations Board election to be represented by the NewsGuild-CWA. The vote came despite aggressive opposition from the paper&#x27;s management team, reversing more than a century of anti-union sentiment at one of the largest newspapers in the country.

<text>Proclus of Constantinople (Greek: Πρόκλος; c. 390 – 24 July 446) was the Archbishop of Constantinople from 434 until his death. Renowned for his homiletic abilities, Proclus played a central role in the Nestorian controversy. His contributions to the theology of the developing cult of the Virgin Mary place him among the early and foremost Marian theologians. He is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church, the Eastern Catholic Churches, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Oriental Orthodoxy.

== Biography ==
Proclus was born around the year 390 and became a reader in Constantinople at a young age. He studied rhetoric and classical authors under private tutors, and came under the influence of Alexandrian intellectuals who had emigrated to the city. He is traditionally held to have been the friend and disciple of Saint John Chrysostom (397–405), who is said to have ordained him. However, Constas shows that this link between the two men was retroactively created in the Medieval period. Instead, Proclus was a disciple of and personal secretary to archbishop Atticus of Constantinople (406–425) who was impressed by his talents as a writer, rhetorician, and orator. During his episcopate, Atticus ordained Proclus deacon and priest, and the young man quickly became an essential part of the archiepiscopal administration. He acted both as scribe and as ghost-writer for his bishop, who was less eloquent and intellectually well-rounded than his protege. During the course of pastoral and diplomatic visits to the Imperial residences, Proclus forged his lasting relationships with the Imperial family.

He was a candidate to succeed Atticus upon the latter&#x27;s death in 425, but the populace favoured the elderly Sisinnius I of Constantinople (426–427) for his lack of affiliation with local rivalries and his charity to the poor. Proclus befriended him, and Sisinnius consecrated him Bishop of the dependent See of Cyzicus in 426. His enthronement was prevented when the residents of the city refused to receive him and elected their own bishop in contravention of canon law, so Proclus remained at Constantinople as titular bishop. Under Sissinius&#x27; patronage, Proclus became increasingly famous as a popular preacher, earning him comparisons with the renowned homiletic talents of John Chrysostom. On the death of Sisinnius factions broke out once again with Proclus and Philip of Side, who had also contested in 425, as the leading candidates. The competition was so fierce that the Emperor intervened and installed an outsider, the well-known Antiochene orator Nestorius, as Archbishop (sed. 428–431). In late 428, as part of his vicious and unpopular persecution of heretical groups, Nestorius and his retinue began to preach against the propriety of calling Mary the Theotokos. A traditional title that had been in use for over a century and utilised by preceding bishops of Constantinople like Gregory of Nazianzus, Theotokos was by this point deeply associated with the liturgical life of the capital. Although he was initially reticent to get involved in the emerging dispute when a monastic deacon named Basil submitted a formal accusation of heresy to the Emperor against the Archbishop, Proclus withdrew from communion with Nestorius. In 430, on the occasion of a Feast Day of the Theotokos that was probably instituted under Atticus for the Nativity Cycle, Proclus was invited by Nestorius to deliver a homily from the pulpit before a mixed crowd. He preached his celebrated panegyric sermon on the Virgin Mary, a masterpiece of exegetical insight and rhetorical flourish that has been called the most famous Marian sermon in history, and which was later inserted into the beginning of the of the first Council of Ephesus.

Proclus&#x27; sermon did much to progress the case against Nestorius, and he would continue to launch homiletic attacks on the Archbishop. The controversy quickly spread beyond the capital and engulfed the Christian world. Although he did not attend the Council of Ephesus at which Nestorius was subsequently deposed, Proclus was the recipient of a letter from the conciliar president and leader of the anti-Nestorian party, Cyril of Alexandria, in which his contribution was warmly acknowledged. In the aftermath of these tumultuous events, the clergy of Constantinople were once again thrown into factionalism concerning who was to ascend the archiepiscopal throne. Proclus was now the leading candidate but because he was already a bishop, formal application of canon law prevented his transfer from one diocese to another. His opponents in government used this against him because popular support, not least among powerful women, was considered a threat in a time when religious disputes were at fever pitch. Instead, a quiet, aged priest called Maximianus was elected (sed. 431–434), who oversaw the union of the Cyrillian party with the Johannine party.

By the time Archbishop Maximianus died on Great and Holy Thursday of 434, the Imperial government had firmly come down on the side of the anti-Nestorians and were keen to avoid further electoral disturbances. To that end, Proclus was immediately enthroned by the permission of the Emperor Theodosius II and the bishops gathered at Constantinople. His first care was the funeral of his predecessor, and he then sent to both Patriarchs Cyril of Alexandria and John I of Antioch the usual synodical letters announcing his appointment, both of whom approved of it. His archiepiscopacy was dominated by the aftermath of the Council of Ephesus, and his consecration was rejected by the portion of Eastern bishops who had seceded from communion with John of Antioch after his reunion with Cyril.

In 436 the bishops of Armenia consulted Proclus upon certain doctrines prevalent in their country and attributed to Theodore of Mopsuestia asking for their condemnation. Proclus replied the next year in the celebrated letter known as the &quot;Tome to the Armenians&quot;, which he sent to the Eastern bishops, asking them to sign it and to join in condemning the doctrines of the Armenians. They approved of the letters, but from admiration of Theodore hesitated to condemn the doctrines attributed to him. Proclus replied that while he desired the extracts subjoined to his Tome to be condemned, he had not attributed them to Theodore or any individual, not desiring the condemnation of any person. A rescript from Theodosius procured by Proclus, declaring his wish that all should live in peace and that no imputation should be made against anyone who died in communion with the church, appeased the storm. The whole affair showed conspicuously the moderation and tact of Proclus and resulted in a period of peace for the Churches of the East after the Imperial Commission secured a forced union through exiling Nestorius and his closest supporters.

In continuity with the conciliation of Atticus in the latter years of his episcopacy, Proclus oversaw the transfer of the relics of Saint John Chrysostom from Comana Pontica back to Constantinople in 438, where he interred them with great honour in the Church of the Twelve apostles. This action finally reconciled to the Church those of Saint John&#x27;s adherents who had separated themselves in consequence of the deposition as Archbishop which they regarded as having been unjust.

In 439, at the request of a deputation from Caesarea in Cappadocia, Proclus selected as their new bishop Thalassius, who was about to be appointed praetorian prefect of the East.

In the time of Proclus, the Trisagion came into use. The occasion is said to have been a time when violent earthquakes lasted for four months at Constantinople so that the people were obliged to leave the city and encamp in the fields.

Proclus died on 24 July 446. He appears to have been wise, moderate, and conciliatory, desirous, while strictly adhering to Orthodoxy himself, to win over those who differed from him by persuasion rather than force.

== Theology ==
Having been educated in the cosmopolitan capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, Proclus was learned in the various streams of thought that characterised late antiquity. A strong rhetorician, he made robust use of the Old Testament, vibrant imagery, rhythmic delivery, colorful metaphors and logical argumentation. He also continued the trend of his predecessors in expanding both the construction of churches, shrines and monasteries suitable to house growing numbers of relics and monks, but also the jurisdictional reach of the See of Constantinople. Proclus became famous as a popular preacher, gaining a reputation as successor in homiletic prowess to John Chrysostom.

=== Christology and Soteriology ===
Proclus&#x27; homilies present clear affirmations of the unity and duality of the natures of Christ in terminology Constas describes as &quot;anticipating the language of Chalcedon&quot;. He taught a union of opposites, a union of natures where they remain unconfused, divinity clothed with humanity. While maintaining the two natures he stressed the personal unity of Jesus. For Proclus the Word-made-flesh dying sacrificially was essential to secure salvation; no mere man could pay the debt of sin, but man had sinned so man had to pay, necessitating the incarnation of God.

=== Mariology ===
Proclus&#x27; chief contribution to Theology belongs to the area of Marian theology and devotion. His mentor Archbishop Atticus made important contributions to the development of early Byzantine veneration of the Virgin in the two decades prior to the Council of Ephesus, chiefly through the establishment of the first officially sanctioned Marian feast. Constas argues that through his role as Atticus&#x27; secretary Proclus provided literary assistance for his bishop in these endeavours. Proclus&#x27; famous Homily 1 delivered in Constantinople in 430 &quot;defined the rhetoric and rationale for the cult of the Virgin Mary throughout the Byzantine period&quot;, &quot;attained de facto canonical status&quot; after it was attached to the proceedings of the Ephesine Council, and was the basis of centuries of theological re-imagining and reflection. According to Constas, the sermon together with its associated Marian Feast &quot;mark an important juncture in the development of the cult of the Virgin in Constantinople&quot;. The text interweaves resplendent praises of Mary with celebration of female virginity, directly confronting Nestorius&#x27; two-pronged criticisms of local Marian piety and the Empress Pulcheria.

Proclus was a champion of the traditional title Theotokos, defending its usage with intertwined Christological and Mariological explication, and also upheld the doctrine of the perpetual virginity. Likewise, he taught the traditional Eve-Mary parallel that had been current in Christian theology since the second century. One of the primary texts he cites to support this is Ezekiel 44:1–2, interpreting the closed gate of the sanctuary typologically, in continuity with 4th-century figures like the Cappadocians who laid the foundation for the rhetorical praise of the sacred womb. Proclus&#x27; Mariology is an extension of his Christology, whereby the mystery of virginal motherhood safeguards the mystery of the incarnation, rendering Mary and her qualities worthy of effulgent praise. His repertoire, drawing upon existing traditions through expansion, became foundational to Byzantine Mariology, drawing liberally on Old Testament stories, some of which were corrolaries of Christological typologies. Among others images, the Virgin is the spiritual Garden of Eden in which dwells the second Adam, the New Eve who cancels the disobedience of the first, the Ark who carried the spiritual Noah, the ladder of Jacob by which God descends and man ascends, the Fleece of Gideon drenched with the dew of heaven, the burning bush ablaze but not consumed by divinity, and the throne of the Cherubim on which rests the glory of God. She is a harbour, a sea, a palace, a bridal chamber, she is more spacious than heaven, a valley blossoming with fruit to feed the world and her womb is wider than the heavens. These images are drawn together in a context of active veneration; in his homily of 430, Proclus associates the calling together of the congregation before him via land and sea with the agency of Mary. Shoemaker identifies word for word correspondence between Proclus&#x27; Homily 1 and a Marian hymn contained within the Georgian Chantbook of Jerusalem, compiled prior to the mid-6th century. He argues on the basis of theological content that the hymn was already extant by 430 and that Proclus was quoting it, which indicates pre-existing Marian piety between Jerusalem and Constantinople upon which the bishop drew for his rhetorical purposes.

His sermons also bristle with Marian theology through innovative allegorical interpretation of Old Testament texts such as the prophetic lampstand in Zechariah. According to Proclus, Mary is &quot;the only bridge between God and men&quot; and all women are blessed through her renewal of the female sex.

== Works ==
The works of Proclus consist of 20 sermons (some of doubtful authenticity). Five were published by cardinal Angelo Mai, of which 3 are preserved only in a Syriac version, the Greek being lost; 7 letters, along with several addressed to him by other persons; and a few fragments of other letters and sermons. Of the 8 homilies on Christology attributed to him, 7 are authentic.

Proclus was cited by Cardinal John Henry Newman for his work on Mariology and his strong support of the conciliar dogma on the Theotokos.

== Feast day ==
The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates his feast day on 20 November. The Catholic Church lists him on 24 October.

<text>In geometry, a catenoid is a type of surface, arising by rotating a catenary curve about an axis (a surface of revolution). It is a minimal surface, meaning that it occupies the least area when bounded by a closed space. It was formally described in 1744 by the mathematician Leonhard Euler.

Soap film attached to twin circular rings will take the shape of a catenoid. Because they are members of the same associate family of surfaces, a catenoid can be bent into a portion of a helicoid, and vice versa.

== Geometry ==
The catenoid was the first non-trivial minimal surface in 3-dimensional Euclidean space to be discovered apart from the plane. The catenoid is obtained by rotating a catenary about its directrix. It was found and proved to be minimal by Leonhard Euler in 1744.

Early work on the subject was published also by Jean Baptiste Meusnier. There are only two minimal surfaces of revolution (surfaces of revolution which are also minimal surfaces): the plane and the catenoid.

The catenoid may be defined by the following parametric equations:
formula_1
where formula_2 and formula_3 and formula_4 is a non-zero real constant.

In cylindrical coordinates:
formula_5
where formula_4 is a real constant.

A physical model of a catenoid can be formed by dipping two circular rings into a soap solution and slowly drawing the circles apart.

The catenoid may be also defined approximately by the stretched grid method as a facet 3D model.

== Helicoid transformation ==

Because they are members of the same associate family of surfaces, one can bend a catenoid into a portion of a helicoid without stretching. In other words, one can make a (mostly) continuous and isometric deformation of a catenoid to a portion of the helicoid such that every member of the deformation family is minimal (having a mean curvature of zero). A parametrization of such a deformation is given by the system
formula_7
for formula_8, with deformation parameter formula_9, where:
* formula_10 corresponds to a right-handed helicoid, 
* formula_11 corresponds to a catenoid, and
* formula_12 corresponds to a left-handed helicoid.

<doc id="273332" wikidata="Q1539448" url="?curid=273332" title="The Nylon Curtain">
<text>The Nylon Curtain is the eighth studio album by American singer-songwriter Billy Joel, released on September 23, 1982, and produced by Phil Ramone.

&quot;The Nylon Curtain&quot; peaked at on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart, with two million sales in the U.S. It was one of the first albums to be digitally recorded, mixed, and mastered.

==Background==
The album is among Joel&#x27;s most ambitious efforts, and Joel has openly acknowledged that it is one of his personal favorites, calling it &quot;the recording I&#x27;m most proud of and the material I&#x27;m most proud of.&quot; When he recorded the album, he said in an interview that he wanted to &quot;create a sonic masterpiece.&quot; Joel spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album. He said that the process of making the album was &quot;exhausting.&quot; Critics have interpreted the album to be, in part, an homage to the music of The Beatles and the then-recently deceased John Lennon.

Saxophonist/multi-instrumentalist Richie Cannata left the band prior to recording, so Joel, bassist Doug Stegmeyer, drummer Liberty DeVitto and guitarists David Brown and Russell Javors recorded the album mostly by themselves, thus making it Joel&#x27;s first album since &quot;Streetlife Serenade&quot; not to feature a regular saxophonist, although Eddie Daniels plays clarinet on the closing track &quot;Where&#x27;s the Orchestra?&quot; alongside Charles McCracken on cello and Dominic Cortese on accordion. Saxophonist/multi-instrumentalist Mark Rivera, formerly of the band Tycoon, joined the band as of The Nylon Curtain Tour to replace Cannata.

Regarding the album&#x27;s themes, Joel has stated &quot;It was during the Reagan years, and the diminishing horizons in America at the time [meant that] all of a sudden you weren&#x27;t going to be able to inherit [the kind of life] your old man had.&quot; This pessimism about the American dream, in Joel&#x27;s view, permeates most of the songs on the album. Joel also said that the theme of the album was &quot;an American dilemma, specifically of people born after World War II.&quot; He said that although he doesn&#x27;t provide solutions to the dilemma, he &quot;hope[d] the record speaks like someone in that age group, if only just to tie us all together as people, as an entity.&quot;

Pop-culture journalist Chuck Klosterman praised songs from the album, specifically &quot;Laura&quot; and &quot;Where&#x27;s the Orchestra?&quot;, in his book &quot;Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs&quot;.

==Production==
Joel stated in an interview that most of the songs on the album were written in the same sequence in which they appear on the album. The album&#x27;s production schedule was slightly thrown off near the end of production due to Joel getting into a motorcycle accident.

The album opens with &quot;Allentown&quot;, which despite the name is actually about the nearby town of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Bethlehem, largely based in the production of steel for automobiles, was experiencing economic difficulties in the midst of the early 1980s recession that impacted the steel industry. Joel wrote the melody for &quot;Allentown&quot; eight years before finishing it, later completing the lyrics in time for inclusion on &quot;The Nylon Curtain&quot;.

According to Joel, the titular character from the song &quot;Laura&quot; was supposed to represent anyone who knows how to &quot;push your buttons&quot; and make you feel guilty. He also explained that the character, despite having the female-oriented name &quot;Laura&quot;, could represent anybody, regardless of sex.

&quot;Pressure&quot; is about reaching a certain age and realizing the real-life responsibilities one has to deal with. The song was recorded with eight different overdubbed synthesizer tracks, as well as a segment with four people playing the mandolin.

The closing song to Side A, &quot;Goodnight Saigon&quot;, is about American soldiers fighting in the Vietnam War, and was written by Joel at the request of his veteran peers who fought during the war. Joel wanted to avoid creating a political song that took sides, instead opting to describe things entirely from the soldiers&#x27; point-of-view in the midst of the action. Although Joel never fought as a soldier in Vietnam (Joel explained in an interview that he was a draft dodger during the time of the war), he had several peers at the time who did, some of whom never returned, and received input from many of his friends who had served in the army in order to accurately depict what it was like being stationed in Vietnam. The song opens and closes with the sound of the rotors spinning on a Bell UH-1 Iroquois (or &quot;Huey&quot;), a military helicopter which was heavily used during the Vietnam War.

The B-side of &quot;The Nylon Curtain&quot; opens with &quot;She&#x27;s Right On Time&quot;, an uplifting love song, to contrast with the more serious tone of the preceding &quot;Goodnight Saigon.&quot; The song details the anticipated reunion between two lovers, told from the point-of-view of the man in the relationship waiting for the woman to arrive. Since the song was written by Joel around Christmas time, the preparation of a Christmas tree was used as an analogy throughout the song.

&quot;A Room Of Our Own&quot; thematically opposes &quot;She&#x27;s Right On Time&quot;, detailing a couple who needs time away from each other; the song lays out numerous differences between the two.

The song &quot;Surprises&quot;, described by Joel as a &quot;grand metaphysical statement&quot;, is about how one shouldn&#x27;t be surprised by their inability to control things, though the song is open to several different interpretations according to Joel.

The first three songs on side B all display a relationship theme. “She’s Right On Time” describing the reunion, “A Room Of Our Own” describing the decline as the lovers drift apart, and “Surprises” with the inevitable separation.

&quot;Scandinavian Skies&quot;, which prominently features string parts inspired by the songs &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; by The Beatles, was inspired by a horrifying drug experience Joel went through during a flight.

The closing song, &quot;Where&#x27;s The Orchestra?&quot;, is about a man who goes to see a live play expecting a musical, only to realize that it&#x27;s a regular stage show; according to Joel, this is a metaphor for life, specifically the realization that it&#x27;s not as grand and over-the-top as it is sometimes made out to be. Joel tried to make the song feel reminiscent of musical plays. In the studio recording, Joel&#x27;s vocals play from the left speaker channel, whereas the orchestral backing is in the right speaker channel, to emulate a man sitting in a theater seat and watching a play. The song closes by reprising the melody of &quot;Allentown&quot;, thus bringing the album full-circle.

<text>Harrison Gray Otis (February 10, 1837 – July 30, 1917) was a Union Army officer during the American Civil War who later became president and general manager of the Times Mirror Company, then the publisher of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===

Otis was born near Marietta, Ohio, on February 10, 1837, the son of Stephen and Sally (Dyar) Otis. His father was from Vermont and his mother, a native of Nova Scotia, Canada, came to Ohio from Boston, Massachusetts, with her family. The young Otis received schooling until he was fourteen, when he became a printer&#x27;s apprentice at the &quot;Noble County Courier&quot; in Ohio.

==Career==
Otis was a delegate from Kentucky to the Republican National Convention that nominated Abraham Lincoln for president in 1860. 

===Civil War===
At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, he left his job as a compositor in the office of the &quot;Louisville Journal&quot; to volunteer as a private for the Union army. Otis enlisted as a Sergeant in Kentucky on June 25, 1861, in Company I of the 12th Ohio Infantry Regiment. He fought with the 12th at the Battle of Scary Creek, Battle of Carnifex Ferry, Battle of South Mountain, Battle of Antietam, Battle of Cloyd&#x27;s Mountain, and the Battle of Lynchburg. 

On July 2, 1864, the veterans of the 12th Ohio were transferred to the 23rd Ohio Infantry, and with Company H, Otis fought at the Second Battle of Kernstown where he was wounded. He was promoted to 1st Sergeant on March 1, 1862, 2nd Lieutenant on September 30, 1862, 1st Lieutenant on March 21, 1863, Captain on July 1, 1864, and Lieutenant-Colonel on March 13, 1865. Otis was mustered out of the Army on July 26, 1865.

He was wounded twice in battle, was &quot;twice breveted for gallant and meritorious conduct&quot; and was promoted seven times.

===Journalism===
After the war, Otis was Official Reporter of the Ohio House of Representatives, then moved to Washington, D.C., where he was a government official, correspondent and editor. In 1876, he and his family moved to Santa Barbara, California, which had a population then of about 3,000, and he purchased a local newspaper, the &quot;Santa Barbara Press&quot;, from William Welles Hollister, effective March 11 of that year. He gave up journalism temporarily in 1879 when he was offered the post of chief government agent or special treasury agent of the Northern Seal Islands, now known as the Pribilof Islands, in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the newly acquired territory of Alaska. He left that position in 1881 to return to Santa Barbara.

Otis was editing his newspaper there when he went to Los Angelesa larger city with a population of some 12,500and agreed with the firm of Yarnell, Caystile &amp; Mathes to take over editorial responsibilities at the &quot;Los Angeles Daily Times&quot;, now the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Beginning August 1, 1882, he was to &quot;have the editorial conduct of the &quot;Daily Times&quot; and &quot;Weekly Mirror&quot;,&quot; according to an announcement in the &quot;Times&quot;. Later the company was named Times-Mirror, and on April 6, 1886, it was reorganized, with Albert McFarland and W.A. Spalding as owners and Otis as president and general manager. That was Otis&#x27;s official title at the time of his death in 1917. The &quot;Times&quot; story about his demise noted that the Times-Mirror Company was &quot;publishers of the &quot;Los Angeles Daily Times.&quot;&quot; The article called Otis the &quot;principal owner&quot; of the newspaper but never referred to him as publisher. Eleven years earlier, however the Associated Press had called him &quot;publisher of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.&quot;

Otis was known for his conservative political views, which were reflected in the paper. His home was one of three buildings that were targeted in the 1910 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; bombing. During his time as publisher of the Times Otis is known for coining the phrase &quot;You are either with me, or against me.&quot;
When the Spanish–American War broke out in 1898, Otis asked President William McKinley for an appointment as Assistant Secretary of War. But Secretary of War Russell A. Alger did not want the conservative Otis serving under him. Otis thereupon again volunteered for the Army and was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. He served in the Philippines. He did not see any action against the Spanish, but commanded the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, VIII Corps during the Philippine–American War.

His support for his adopted city was instrumental in its growth. He was a member of a group of investors who bought land in the San Fernando Valley based on inside knowledge that the Los Angeles Aqueduct would soon irrigate it.

Otis and his son-in-law Harry Chandler and others formed the Colorado River Land Company, which bought land in the Mexicali Valley of Baja California at the turn of the twentieth century when Mexico&#x27;s President Porfirio Díaz encouraged foreign investment to develop the country. The company weathered the Mexican Revolution (1910–20), but the rich agricultural land held in foreign hands was expropriated by the Mexican government during its postrevolutionary land reform.

On December 23, 1916, General Harrison Gray Otis donated his spacious Wilshire Boulevard home across the street from MacArthur Park, known as the Bivouac, to Los Angeles County to be used &quot;continuously and perpetually for the Arts and advancement of the Arts.&quot; The Otis Art Institute of the Los Angeles Museum of History, Science, and Art eventually became Otis College of Art and Design. The home was torn down in the 1950s, but the school built new buildings and occupied the space until 1997. It is now the site of a public elementary school.

==Personal life==
Otis married Eliza Ann Wetherby in Lowell, Ohio, on September 11, 1859, and they had three daughters, Lillian Otis McPherson, Marian Otis Chandler, who was secretary of the &quot;Times-Mirror&quot;, and Mabel Otis Booth.

==Death==
Otis died on July 30, 1917, at the home of his son-in-law, Harry Chandler, in Los Angeles.

<doc id="273350" wikidata="Q463201" url="?curid=273350" title="Gennadius of Constantinople">
<text>Gennadius of Constantinople (; died 17 November 471) was the patriarch of Constantinople from August 458 until his death. Gennadius is known to have been a learned writer who followed the School of Antioch of literal exegesis, although few writings have been left about him. He is commemorated in the Eastern Orthodox Church on 17 November but is not listed in the Roman Martyrology.

== Biography ==
His first public writing was quoted by Facundus (Defensio, II, iv) against Cyril of Alexandria in two works, probably in 431 or 432, including a passage to show that his work was more violent even than the letter of Ibas. The 12 Anathemas of Saint Cyril and Two Books to Parthenius were criticised. In the latter he exclaims, &quot;How many times have I heard blasphemies from Cyril of Alexandria? Woe to the scourge of Alexandria!&quot;. In 433 Gennadius probably reconciled with Cyril. If Cyril&#x27;s letter of 434 (Ep. lvi) is to the same Gennadius, they were friends in that year. Gennadius was a presbyter at Constantinople when he succeeded Anatolius of Constantinople in 458 as the Bishop of Constantinople. From the beginning of his episcopate Gennadius proved his zeal for the Christian faith and the maintenance of discipline. His discretion was before long tested.

Timothy II of Alexandria, the monophysite who made himself the Patriarch of Alexandria and was later chased from the Patriarchate by order of the Roman emperor, had obtained leave to come to Constantinople, intending to re-establish himself on his throne. On 17 June 460, Pope Leo I warned Gennadius (Ep. clxx) against Timothy II, and urged him to prevent the voyage of Timothy II and to secure the immediate consecration of an Orthodox Patriarch for Alexandria. Timothy II was banished to the Chersonese, and Timothy Salophakiolos was chosen bishop of Alexandria in his stead. About the same time, Gennadius&#x27; liberality and desire for order was observed in his appointment of Marcian, a Novatianist who had come over to the Catholic Church, the &quot;oeconomus&quot; of the goods of the church of Constantinople.

Two Egyptian solitaries told John Moschus a story which is also recorded by Theodorus Lector. The church of Saint Pope Eleutherius at Constantinople was served by a reader named Carisius, who led a disorderly life. Gennadius first reprimanded him and then had him flogged. When both measures proved ineffectual, the patriarch prayed to Eleutherius to either correct the unworthy reader or to take him from the world. Next day Carisius was found dead, to the terror of the whole town. Theodorus also relates how a painter, presuming to depict the Saviour under the form of Jupiter, had his hand withered, but was healed by the prayers of Gennadius.

About the same time Daniel the Stylite began to live on a column near Constantinople, apparently without the permission of the Patriarch or the owner of the property where the pillar stood, who strongly objected to this strange invasion of his land. The Emperor Leo I protected the ascetic, and some time later sent Gennadius to ordain him priest, which he is said to have done standing at the foot of the column because Daniel objected to being ordained and refused to let the bishop mount the ladder. At the end of the rite, however, the patriarch ascended to give Holy Communion to the stylite and to receive it from him. Whether he then imposed his hands on him is not said. Possibly he considered it sufficient to extend them from below towards Daniel. According to Theodorus Lector, Gennadius would allow no one to become a cleric unless he had learned the Psalter by heart.

Measures had been taken against simony, the buying and selling of holy orders, by the Council of Chalcedon. It seems not later than 459, Gennadius celebrated a great council of 81 bishops, many of whom were from the East and even from Egypt, including those who had been dispossessed of their sees by Timothy II of Alexandria. The letter of this council against simony is still preserved (Giovanni Domenico Mansi, VII, 912). An encyclical was issued, adding anathema to the former sentence.

Gennadius died 25 August 471. He stands out as an able and successful administrator whom historians have roundly praised.

== Biblical works ==
John Moschus described Gennadius as very mild and of great purity. Gennadius of Massilia said Gennadius was &quot;lingua nitidus et ingenio acer&quot; (refined tongue and sharp intellect), and so rich in knowledge of the ancients that he composed a commentary on the whole Book of Daniel. The continuation of Jerome&#x27;s Chronicle by Marcellinus Comes tells us (according to some manuscripts) that Gennadius commented on all epistles of Paul of Tarsus.

Gennadius wrote a commentary on Daniel and many other parts of Old Testament and on all the Pauline epistles, and a great number of homilies. Of these only a few fragments remain. The principal fragments of his biblical works include Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, and Hebrews, and are interesting specimens of 5th century exegesis. Some fragments are collected in Jacques Paul Migne, &quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot;, LXXXV, chiefly from the two &quot;catena&quot; of John Antony Cramer on Romans; a few passages are found in the catena of Oecumenius, others in the catena of Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos, and a few in the Vienna MS. gr. 166 (46).

Gennadius exhibited a learned style and followed the Antiochene school of literal exegesis. &quot;Romans&quot;, a series of explanatory remarks on isolated texts, is his most significant work.

<text>Fravitta of Constantinople (, &quot;Fravitas&quot;; 490), also known as &quot;Fravitas&quot;, &quot;Flavitas&quot;, or &quot;Flavianus II&quot;, was the patriarch of Constantinople (488–489). 

According to Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos, on the death of Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople, the emperor Zeno placed on the altar of the great Church of Constantinople two sheets of paper. On one was written a prayer that God would send an angel to inscribe on the blank sheet the name of him whom He wished to be the patriarch. A fast of 40 days with prayer was ordered. The church was given into the custody of a confidential eunuch, the imperial chamberlain, and the imperial seal set on the casket containing the papers.

Fravitta was a presbyter in charge of the suburban church of Saint Thecla. Fueled with ambition, he paid the eunuch large sums, and promised him more, to write his name on the blank sheet. At the end of the 40 days the casket was opened; the name of Fravitta was found, and he was enthroned amid universal acclamations. Within 4 months he died, and the powerful eunuch was pressing his executors for the promised gold. They revealed the odious tale to the emperor. The forger was turned out of all his employments and driven from the city. The emperor Zeno, ashamed of his failure, entrusted the election of the new patriarch to the clergy. However, the correspondence between Zeno, Fravitta, and Pope Felix III on the appointment show no trace of this story.

Fravitta simultaneously wrote letters to Peter III of Alexandria asking for his communion, and a synodal to Pope Felix III of Rome for his sanction and co-operation. The synodal was carried to Rome by monks of Constantinople who had always kept separate from Acacius and his friend Peter III. An accompanying letter of Zeno showed great affection for Fravitta; Zeno had only worked for his appointment because he thought him worthy and to restore peace and unity to the churches. Pope Felix III, delighted with the letters, had Zeno&#x27;s read aloud to the deputation and all the clergy of Rome, who expressed loud approval.

When the Pope, however, wished the monks from Constantinople to undertake that the names of Acacius and Peter III should be rejected from the diptychs, they replied that they had no instructions on that point. The joy of the Pope was destroyed by the arrival at Rome of a copy of the letter which Fravitta had sent to Peter III, denying all communion with Rome. The Pope would not hear a word more from the monks. Whether the story of Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos be true or not, Fravitta stands disgraced by this duplicity.

<doc id="273368" wikidata="Q1296038" url="?curid=273368" title="Euphemius of Constantinople">
<text>Euphemius of Constantinople (Greek: Εὐφήμιος; died 515) was patriarch of Constantinople (490–496). Theophanes the Confessor calls him Euthymius. Prior to his appointment, Euphemius was a presbyter of Constantinople, administrator of a hospital for the poor at Neapolis, unsuspected of any Eutychian leanings, and is described as learned and very virtuous.

== Acacian schism ==
In 482, Emperor Zeno had published a decree called the &quot;Henotikon&quot;, which forbade in the current theological discussions any other criterion but those of the Councils of First Council of Nicaea and First Council of Constantinople (ignoring the decrees of Chalcedon), carefully avoided speaking of Christ&#x27;s two natures, and used ambiguous formulae that were meant to conciliate the Monophysites. Despite his efforts, the &quot;Henotikon&quot; really satisfied no one, Monophysites disliked it as much as the Orthodox. However, Acacius of Constantinople at Constantinople, Peter III of Alexandria Patriarch of Alexandria, and Peter the Fuller Patriarch of Antioch had all signed it. Pope Felix III convened in 484 a Roman synod of sixty-seven bishops that condemned the emperor&#x27;s decree, deposed and excommunicated Acacius, Peter III, and Peter Fuller. Acacius retorted by striking the pope&#x27;s name from his diptychs and persecuted Catholics at Constantinople. When he died, Fravitta of Constantinople, his successor, applied for recognition at Rome, but in vain, since he would not give up communion with Peter III of Alexandria.

Euphemius immediately recognized the Council of Chalcedon, restored the pope&#x27;s name to his diptychs, and broke with Peter III of Alexandria, who died in October of the year of Euphemius&#x27;s accession (490). By these acts, he showed his desire to heal the rift with Rome. Unfortunately, he still refused to erase the names of his two predecessors (Acacius and Fravitta) from the diptychs, where they appeared among the faithful departed. Pope Felix III insisted that heretics and favourers of heresy should not be prayed for publicly; Euphemius repeated his attempts at reconciliation to Pope Gelasius I in 492, but the problem of his predecessors remained; Euphemius could not remove their names from the diptychs without causing embarrassment or insult to those they had baptised and ordained. Gelasius allowed that in other circumstances he would have written to announce his election, but sourly observes that the custom existed only between bishops who were united in communion, and was not to be extended to those who, like Euphemius, preferred a strange alliance to that with Saint Peter. As a mark of condescension Gelasius granted the canonical remedy to all who had been baptised and ordained by Acacius.

Theodoric the Great had become master of Italy, and in 493 sent Faustus and Irenaeus to the emperor Anastasius I Dicorus to ask for peace. During their sojourn at Constantinople the envoys received complaints from the Greeks against the Roman church, which they reported to the pope. Euphemius urged that the condemnation of Acacius by one prelate only was invalid; to excommunicate a metropolitan of Constantinople a general council was necessary.

== Patriarch and Emperor ==
Before the accession of the Emperor Anastasius I Dicorus, Euphemius had made him sign a profession of faith; eventually he fell foul of the emperor. As the Isaurian War was then under way, Euphemius was accused of treason by revealing the emperor&#x27;s plans to his enemies. A soldier, either by Anastasius&#x27;s own order or to gain his favour, drew his sword on Euphemius at the door of the sacristy but was struck down by an attendant. The emperor further wanted back his written profession of faith, which Euphemius refused to give up, so Anastasius assembled the bishops who were in the capital and preferred charges against their patriarch, whom they obsequiously excommunicated and deposed (495). The people loyally refused to surrender him but inevitably yielded to the emperor.

Meanwhile, Euphemius, fearing for his life, sought sanctuary in the baptistery, and refused to go out until Macedonius II of Constantinople had promised on the word of the emperor that no violence should be done to him when they conducted him to exile. With a proper feeling of respect for the dignity of his fallen predecessor, Macedonius made the attendant deacon take off the newly-given pallium and clothed himself in the dress of a simple presbyter, &quot;not daring to wear&quot; his insignia before their canonical owner. After some conversation, Macedonius (who would follow Euphemius to the very same place of exile under the same emperor) handed to him the proceeds of a loan he had raised for his expenses. Euphemius was exiled to Asia Minor and died 515 at Ancyra. He was recognized to the end as lawful patriarch by his peers in the East who included Elias I of Jerusalem Patriarch of Jerusalem, and Patriarch Flavian II of Antioch.
