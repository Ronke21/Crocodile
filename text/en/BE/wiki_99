<text>Polyethylene terephthalate (or poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET, PETE, or the obsolete PETP or PET-P), is the most common thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family and is used in fibres for clothing, containers for liquids and foods, and thermoforming for manufacturing, and in combination with glass fibre for engineering resins.

In 2016, annual production of PET was 56 million tons. The biggest application is in fibres (in excess of 60%), with bottle production accounting for about 30% of global demand. In the context of textile applications, PET is referred to by its common name, polyester, whereas the acronym &quot;PET&quot; is generally used in relation to packaging. Polyester makes up about 18% of world polymer production and is the fourth-most-produced polymer after polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).

PET consists of repeating (C10H8O4) units. PET is commonly recycled, and has the digit 1 (♳) as its resin identification code (RIC). The National Association for PET Container Resources (NAPCOR) defines PET as: &quot;Polyethylene terephthalate items referenced are derived from terephthalic acid (or dimethyl terephthalate) and mono ethylene glycol, wherein the sum of terephthalic acid (or dimethyl terephthalate) and mono ethylene glycol reacted constitutes at least 90 percent of the mass of monomer reacted to form the polymer, and must exhibit a melting peak temperature between 225 °C and 255 °C, as identified during the second thermal scan in procedure 10.1 in ASTM D3418, when heating the sample at a rate of 10 °C/minute.&quot;

Depending on its processing and thermal history, polyethylene terephthalate may exist both as an amorphous (transparent) and as a semi-crystalline polymer. The semicrystalline material might appear transparent (particle size less than 500 nm) or opaque and white (particle size up to a few micrometers) depending on its crystal structure and particle size.

One process for making PET uses bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, which can be synthesized by the esterification reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol with water as a byproduct (this is also known as a condensation reaction), or by transesterification reaction between ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) with methanol as a byproduct. Polymerization is through a polycondensation reaction of the monomers (done immediately after esterification/transesterification) with water as the byproduct.

==Uses==

===Textiles===

Polyester fibres are widely used in the textile industry. The invention of the polyester fibre is attributed to J. R. Whinfield. It was first commercialized in the 1940s by ICI, under the brand &#x27;Terylene&#x27;. Subsequently E. I. DuPont launched the brand &#x27;Dacron&#x27;. As of 2022, there are many brands around the world, mostly Asian.

Polyester fibres are used in fashion apparel often blended with cotton, as heat insulation layers in thermal wear, sportswear and workwear and automotive upholstery.

===Rigid packaging===
Plastic bottles made from PET are widely used for soft drinks, both still and sparkling. For beverages that are degraded by oxygen, such as beer, a multilayer structure is used. PET sandwiches an additional polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) or polyamide (PA) layer to further reduce its oxygen permeability.

Non-oriented PET sheet can be thermoformed to make packaging trays and blister packs. Crystallizable PET withstands freezing and oven baking temperatures. Both amorphous PET and BoPET are transparent to the naked eye. Color-conferring dyes can easily be formulated into PET sheet.

PET is permeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide and this imposes shelf life limitations of contents packaged in PET.

In the early 2000s, the global PET packaging market grew at a compound annual growth rate of 9% to €17 billion in 2006.

===Flexible packaging===
Biaxially oriented PET (BOPET) film (including brands like &quot;Mylar&quot;) can be aluminized by evaporating a thin film of metal onto it to reduce its permeability, and to make it reflective and opaque (MPET). These properties are useful in many applications, including flexible food packaging and thermal insulation (such as space blankets).

===Photovoltaic modules===
BOPET is used in the backsheet of photovoltaic modules. Most backsheets consist of a layer of BOPET laminated to a fluoropolymer or a layer of UV stabilized BOPET.

PET is also used as a substrate in thin film solar cells.

===Thermoplastic resins===
PET can be compounded with glass fibre and crystallization accelerators, to make thermoplastic resins. These can be injection moulded into parts such as housings, covers, electrical appliance components and elements of the ignition system.

=== Nanodiamonds ===
PET is stoichiometrically a mixture of carbon and , and therefore has been used in an experiment involving laser-driven shock compression which created nanodiamonds and superionic water. This could be a possible way of producing nanodiamonds commercially.

===Other applications===

* A waterproofing barrier in undersea cables.
* As a film base.
* As a fibre, spliced into bell rope tops to help prevent wear on the ropes as they pass through the ceiling.
* Since late 2014 as liner material in type IV composite high pressure gas cylinders. PET works as a much better barrier to oxygen than earlier used (LD)PE.
* As a 3D printing filament, as well as in the 3D printing plastic PETG (polyethylene terephthalate glycol). In 3D printing PETG has become a popular material - used for high-end applications like surgical fracture tables to automotive and aeronautical sectors, among other industrial applications. The surface properties can be modified to make PETG self-cleaning for applications like the fabrication of traffic signs for the manufacture of light-emitting diode LED spotlights.
* As one of three layers for the creation of glitter; acting as a plastic core coated with aluminum and topped with plastic to create a light reflecting surface, although as of 2021 many glitter manufacturing companies have begun to phase out the use of PET after calls from organizers of festivals to create bio-friendly glitter alternatives.
* Film for tape applications, such as the carrier for magnetic tape or backing for pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes. Digitalization has caused the virtual disappeance of the magnetic audio and videotape application.
* Water-resistant paper.

==History==
PET was patented in 1941 by John Rex Whinfield, James Tennant Dickson and their employer the Calico Printers&#x27; Association of Manchester, England. E. I. DuPont de Nemours in Delaware, United States, first produced Dacron (PET fiber) in 1950 and used the trademark Mylar (boPET film) in June 1951 and received registration of it in 1952. It is still the best-known name used for polyester film. The current owner of the trademark is DuPont Teijin Films.

In the Soviet Union, PET was first manufactured in the laboratories of the Institute of High-Molecular Compounds of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1949, and its name &quot;Lavsan&quot; is an acronym thereof (лаборатории Института высокомолекулярных соединений Академии наук СССР).

The PET bottle was invented in 1973 by Nathaniel Wyeth and patented by DuPont.

==Physical properties==

PET in its most stable state is a colorless, semi-crystalline resin. However it is intrinsically slow to crystallize compared to other semicrystalline polymers. Depending on processing conditions it can be formed into either non-crystalline (amorphous) or crystalline articles. Its amenability to drawing in manufacturing makes PET useful in fibre and film applications. Like most aromatic polymers, it has better barrier properties than aliphatic polymers. It is strong and impact-resistant. PET is hygroscopic and absorbs water.

About 60% crystallization is the upper limit for commercial products, with the exception of polyester fibers. Transparent products can be produced by rapidly cooling molten polymer below the glass transition temperature (Tg) to form a non-crystalline amorphous solid. Like glass, amorphous PET forms when its molecules are not given enough time to arrange themselves in an orderly, crystalline fashion as the melt is cooled. While at room temperature the molecules are frozen in place, if enough heat energy is put back into them afterward by heating the material above Tg, they can begin to move again, allowing crystals to nucleate and grow. This procedure is known as solid-state crystallization. Amorphous PET also crystallizes and becomes opaque when exposed to solvents, such as chloroform or toluene.

A more crystalline product can be produced by allowing the molten polymer to cool slowly. Rather than forming one large single crystal, this material has a number of spherulites (crystallized areas) each containing many small crystallites (grains). Light tends to scatter as it crosses the boundaries between crystallites and the amorphous regions between them, causing the resulting solid to be translucent. Orientation also renders polymers more transparent. This is why BOPET film and bottles are both crystalline, to a degree, and transparent.

=== Flavor absorption ===
PET has an affinity for hydrophobic flavors, and drinks sometimes need to be formulated with a higher flavor dosage, compared to those going into glass, to offset the flavor taken up by the container. While heavy gauge PET bottles returned for re-use, as in some EU countries, the propensity of PET to absorb flavors makes it necessary to conduct a &quot;sniffer test&quot; on returned bottles to avoid cross-contamination of flavors.

===Intrinsic viscosity===

Different applications of PET require different degrees of polymerization, which can be obtained by modifying the process conditions. The molecular weight of PET is measured by solution viscosity. The preferred method to measure this viscosity is the intrinsic viscosity (IV) of the polymer. Intrinsic viscosity is a dimensionless measurement found by extrapolating the relative viscosity (measured in (dℓ/g)) to zero concentration. Shown below are the IV ranges for common applications:
== Copolymers ==

PET is often copolymerized with other diols or diacids to optimize the properties for particular applications.

===PETG===
For example, cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) can be added to the polymer backbone in place of ethylene glycol. Since this building block is much larger (six additional carbon atoms) than the ethylene glycol unit it replaces, it does not fit in with the neighboring chains the way an ethylene glycol unit would. This interferes with crystallization and lowers the polymer&#x27;s melting temperature. In general, such PET is known as PETG or PET-G (polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified). It is a clear amorphous thermoplastic that can be injection-molded, sheet-extruded or extruded as filament for 3D printing. PETG can be colored during processing.

===Isophthalic acid===

Another common modifier is isophthalic acid, replacing some of the 1,4-(&quot;para-&quot;) linked terephthalate units. The 1,2-(&quot;ortho-&quot;) or 1,3-(&quot;meta&quot;-) linkage produces an angle in the chain, which also disturbs crystallinity.

===Advantages===
Such copolymers are advantageous for certain molding applications, such as thermoforming, which is used for example to make tray or blister packaging from co-PET film, or amorphous PET sheet (A-PET/PETA) or PETG sheet. On the other hand, crystallization is important in other applications where mechanical and dimensional stability are important, such as seat belts. For PET bottles, the use of small amounts of isophthalic acid, CHDM, diethylene glycol (DEG) or other comonomers can be useful: if only small amounts of comonomers are used, crystallization is slowed but not prevented entirely. As a result, bottles are obtainable via stretch blow molding (&quot;SBM&quot;), which are both clear and crystalline enough to be an adequate barrier to aromas and even gases, such as carbon dioxide in carbonated beverages.

==Production==
Polyethylene terephthalate is produced largely from purified terephthalic acid (PTA), as well as to a lesser extent from (mono-)ethylene glycol (MEG) and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT). As of 2022, ethylene glycol is made from ethene found in natural gas, while terephthalic acid comes from p-xylene made from crude oil. Typically an antimony or titanium compound is used as a catalyst, a phosphite is added as a stabilizer and a bluing agent such as cobalt salt is added to mask any yellowing.

=== Processes ===

==== Dimethyl terephthalate process ====

In the dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) process, DMT and excess ethylene glycol (MEG) are transesterified in the melt at 150–200 °C with a basic catalyst. Methanol (CH3OH) is removed by distillation to drive the reaction forward. Excess MEG is distilled off at higher temperature with the aid of vacuum. The second transesterification step proceeds at 270–280 °C, with continuous distillation of MEG as well.

The reactions can be summarized as follows:
;First step
: C6H4(CO2CH3)2 + 2 HOCH2CH2OH → C6H4(CO2CH2CH2OH)2 + 2 CH3OH

;Second step
: &quot;n&quot; C6H4(CO2CH2CH2OH)2 → [(CO)C6H4(CO2CH2CH2O)]n + &quot;n&quot; HOCH2CH2OH

==== Terephthalic acid process ====

In the terephthalic acid process, MEG and PTA are esterified directly at moderate pressure (2.7–5.5 bar) and high temperature (220–260 °C). Water is eliminated in the reaction, and it is also continuously removed by distillation:

: &quot;n&quot; C6H4(CO2H)2 + &quot;n&quot; HOCH2CH2OH → [(CO)C6H4(CO2CH2CH2O)]n + 2&quot;n&quot; H2O

==== Bio-PET ====
Bio-PET is the bio-based counterpart of PET. Essentially in Bio-PET, the MEG is manufactured from ethylene derived from sugar cane ethanol. A better process based on oxidation of ethanol has been proposed, and it is also technically possible to make PTA from readily available bio-based furfural.

=== Bottle processing equipment ===
There are two basic molding methods for PET bottles, one-step and two-step. In two-step molding, two separate machines are used. The first machine injection molds the preform, which resembles a test tube, with the bottle-cap threads already molded into place. The body of the tube is significantly thicker, as it will be inflated into its final shape in the second step using stretch blow molding.

In the second step, the preforms are heated rapidly and then inflated against a two-part mold to form them into the final shape of the bottle. Preforms (uninflated bottles) are now also used as robust and unique containers themselves; besides novelty candy, some Red Cross chapters distribute them as part of the Vial of Life program to homeowners to store medical history for emergency responders.
The two-step process lends itself to third party production remote from the user site. The preforms can be transported and stored by the thousand in a much smaller space than would finished containers, for the second stage to be carried out on the user site on a &#x27;just in time&#x27; basis.
In one-step machines, the entire process from raw material to finished container is conducted within one machine, making it especially suitable for molding non-standard shapes (custom molding), including jars, flat oval, flask shapes, etc. Its greatest merit is the reduction in space, product handling and energy, and far higher visual quality than can be achieved by the two-step system.

===Degradation===
PET is subject to degradation during processing. If the moisture level is too high, hydrolysis will reduce the molecular weight by chain scission, resulting in brittleness. If the residence time and/or melt temperature (temperature at melting) are too high, then thermal degradation or thermooxidative degradation will occur resulting in discoloration and reduced molecular weight, as well as the formation of acetaldehyde, and the formation &quot;gel&quot; or &quot;fish-eye&quot; formations through cross-linking. Mitigation measures include copolymerisation with other monomers like CHDM or isophthalic acid, which lower the melting point and thus the melt temperature of the resin, as well as the addition of polymer stabilisers such as phosphites.

====Acetaldehyde====
Acetaldehyde, which can form by degradation of PET after mishandling of the material, is a colorless, volatile substance with a fruity smell. Although it forms naturally in some fruit, it can cause an off-taste in bottled water. As well as high temperatures (PET decomposes above 300 °C or 570 °F) and long barrel residence times, high pressures and high extruder speeds (which cause shear raising the temperature), can also contribute to the production of acetaldehyde. Photo-oxidation can also cause the gradual formation acetaldehyde over the object&#x27;s lifespan. This proceeds via a Type II Norrish reaction.


When acetaldehyde is produced, some of it remains dissolved in the walls of a container and then diffuses into the product stored inside, altering the taste and aroma. This is not such a problem for non-consumables (such as shampoo), for fruit juices (which already contain acetaldehyde), or for strong-tasting drinks like soft drinks. For bottled water, however, low acetaldehyde content is quite important, because if nothing masks the aroma, even extremely low concentrations (10–20 parts per billion in the water) of acetaldehyde can produce an off-taste.

==Safety and environmental concerns==
Commentary published in &quot;Environmental Health Perspectives&quot; in April 2010 suggested that PET might yield endocrine disruptors under conditions of common use and recommended research on this topic. Proposed mechanisms include leaching of phthalates as well as leaching of antimony.
An article published in &quot;Journal of Environmental Monitoring&quot; in April 2012 concludes that antimony concentration in deionized water stored in PET bottles stays within EU&#x27;s acceptable limit even if stored briefly at temperatures up to 60 °C (140 °F), while bottled contents (water or soft drinks) may occasionally exceed the EU limit after less than a year of storage at room temperature.

===Antimony===
Antimony (Sb) is a metalloid element that is used as a catalyst in the form of compounds such as antimony trioxide (Sb2O3) or antimony triacetate in the production of PET. After manufacturing, a detectable amount of antimony can be found on the surface of the product. This residue can be removed with washing. Antimony also remains in the material itself and can, thus, migrate out into food and drinks. Exposing PET to boiling or microwaving can increase the levels of antimony significantly, possibly above US EPA maximum contamination levels.
The drinking water limit assessed by WHO is 20 parts per billion (WHO, 2003), and the drinking water limit in the United States is 6 parts per billion. Although antimony trioxide is of low toxicity when taken orally, its presence is still of concern. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health investigated the amount of antimony migration, comparing waters bottled in PET and glass: The antimony concentrations of the water in PET bottles were higher, but still well below the allowed maximum concentration. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health concluded that small amounts of antimony migrate from the PET into bottled water, but that the health risk of the resulting low concentrations is negligible (1% of the &quot;tolerable daily intake&quot; determined by the WHO). A later (2006) but more widely publicized study found similar amounts of antimony in water in PET bottles.
The WHO has published a risk assessment for antimony in drinking water.

Fruit juice concentrates (for which no guidelines are established), however, that were produced and bottled in PET in the UK were found to contain up to 44.7 μg/L of antimony, well above the EU limits for tap water of 5 μg/L.

=== Shed microfibres ===
Clothing sheds microfibres in use, during washing and machine drying. Plastic litter slowly forms small particles. Microplastics which are present on the bottom of the river or seabed can be ingested by small marine life, thus entering the food chain. As PET has a higher density than water, a significant amount of PET microparticles may be precipitated in sewage treatment plants. PET microfibers generated by apparel wear, washing or machine drying can become airborne, and be dispersed into fields, where they are ingested by livestock or plants and end up in the human food supply. An study published in the journal Science of The Total Environment found PET accounted for 18% of microplastics in human lung tissue samples, and that there were 0.69 ± 0.84 microplastics per gram of lung tissue.
SAPEA have declared that such particles &#x27;do not pose a widespread risk&#x27;.
PET is known to degrade when exposed to sunlight and oxygen. As of 2016, scarce information exists regarding the life-time of the synthetic polymers in the environment.

==Polyester recycling==


While most thermoplastics can, in principle, be recycled, PET bottle recycling is more practical than many other plastic applications because of the high value of the resin and the almost exclusive use of PET for widely used water and carbonated soft drink bottling. PET bottles lend themselves well to recycling (see below). In many countries PET bottles are recycled to a substantial degree, for example about 75% in Switzerland. The term rPET is commonly used to describe the recycled material, though it is also referred to as R-PET or post-consumer PET (POSTC-PET).

The prime uses for recycled PET are polyester fiber, strapping, and non-food containers. Because of the recyclability of PET and the relative abundance of post-consumer waste in the form of bottles, PET is also rapidly gaining market share as a carpet fiber. PET, like many plastics, is also an excellent candidate for thermal disposal (incineration), as it is composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with only trace amounts of catalyst elements (but no sulfur). In general, PET can either be chemically recycled into its original raw materials (PTA, DMT, and EG), destroying the polymer structure completely; mechanically recycled into a different form, without destroying the polymer; or recycled in a process that includes transesterification and the addition of other glycols, polyols, or glycerol to form a new polyol. The polyol from the third method can be used in polyurethane (PU foam) production, or epoxy-based products, including paints.

In 2023 a process was announced for using PET as the basis for supercapacitor production. PET, being stoichiometrically carbon and , can be turned into a form of carbon containing sheets and nanospheres, with a very high surface area. The process involves holding a mixture of PET, water, nitric acid, and ethanol at a high temperature and pressure for eight hours, followed by centrifugation and drying.

Significant investments were announced in 2021 and 2022 for chemical recycling of PET by glycolysis, methanolysis, and enzymatic recycling to recover monomers. Initially these will also use bottles as feedstock but it is expected that fibres will also be recycled this way in future.

PET is also a desirable fuel for waste-to-energy plants, as it has a high calorific value which helps to reduce the use of primary resources for energy generation.

===Biodegradation===

At least one species of bacterium in the genus &quot;Nocardia&quot; can degrade PET with an esterase enzyme. Esterases are enzymes able to cleave the ester bond between two oxygens that links subunits of PET. The initial degradation of PET can also be achieved esterases expressed by &quot;Bacillus&quot;, as well as &quot;Nocardia&quot;. Japanese scientists have isolated another bacterium, &quot;Ideonella sakaiensis&quot;, that possesses two enzymes which can break down the PET into smaller pieces digestible by the bacteria. A colony of &quot;I. sakaiensis&quot; can disintegrate a plastic film in about six weeks. French researchers report developing an improved PET hydrolase that can depolymerize (break apart) at least 90 percent of PET in 10 hours, breaking it down into individual monomers. Also, an enzyme based on a natural PET-ase was designed with the help of a machine learning algorithm to be able to tolerate pH and temperature changes by the University of Texas at Austin. The PET-ase was found to able to degrade various products and could break them down as fast as 24 hours.

<doc id="292945" wikidata="Q1574701" url="?curid=292945" title="Somebody to Love (Jefferson Airplane song)">
<text>&quot;Somebody to Love&quot; (originally titled &quot;Someone to Love&quot;) is a rock song that was written by Darby Slick. It was originally recorded by the Great Society, and later by Jefferson Airplane. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s version No. 274 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Background==
Written by the Great Society guitarist Darby Slick after realizing his girlfriend had left him, and first performed by that band, which included his then-sister-in-law Grace Slick on vocals, the song made little impact outside of the club circuit in the Bay Area. The song was recorded on December 4, 1965, and released in February 1966 as a single with the B-side another Darby Slick composition titled &quot;Free Advice&quot; on the Northbeach label (Northbeach 1001) and received minimal circulation outside of San Francisco. San Francisco in the mid-1960s was the center of free love, but Darby Slick saw a downside to this ethos, as it could lead to jealousy and disconnect. The song champions loyalty and monogamy, as the singer implores the listener to find that one true love that will nurture them and get them through the tough times.

==Re-recording==
When Grace Slick departed to join Jefferson Airplane, she took this song with her, bringing it to the &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; sessions, along with her own composition &quot;White Rabbit&quot;. Subsequently, the Airplane&#x27;s more ferocious rock-and-roll version became the band&#x27;s first and biggest success, reaching No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The group&#x27;s first hit song, &quot;Somebody To Love&quot; was also one of the first big hits from the San Francisco Bay area and West Coast counterculture scene, to which numerous artists and musicians would be drawn in following years.

Slick&#x27;s original performance of the song with the Great Society is more subdued, with the Jefferson Airplane version sounding far more accusatory and menacing on lines such as &quot;Your mind is so full of bread&quot; and &quot;Your friends, baby, they treat you like a guest.&quot; The lyrics are in the second person, with each two-line verse setting a scene of alienation and despair, and the chorus repeating the title of the song, with slight variations such as: &quot;... / Don&#x27;t you need somebody to love? / Wouldn&#x27;t you love somebody to love? / ...&quot; Like the album on which it appeared, this song was instrumental in publicizing the existence of the Haight-Ashbury counterculture to the rest of the United States.

==Reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; described the song as a &quot;wild dance number loaded with vocal excitement,&quot; calling it a &quot;hard driver, featuring powerful female vocal in the lead [which] never stops from start to finish.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; called the single a &quot;bright, pulsating, rhythmic, sometimes-frenetic, funky rock outing.&quot; Brett Milano of udiscovermusic.com rated Jorma Kaukonen&#x27;s psychedelic guitar solo at the end of the song as one of the 100 all-time greatest, stating that it opens &quot;with those three sustained wailing notes and [closes] with those sign-off chords that leave the song forever unresolved.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Michael Gallucci rated it Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s best song because &quot;it drives harder than almost anything else they ever recorded,&quot; &quot;Slick checks in with her all-time greatest vocal&quot; and &quot;the hook is bigger and brighter than most of the band&#x27;s psychedelic folk-outs.&quot;

==Boogie Pimps version==

A remix of &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; was the debut single of German electronic music duo Boogie Pimps. It was first released in Germany in April 2003 and became a worldwide hit the following year, reaching No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 7 on the Irish Singles Chart. The song also became a top-twenty hit in Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands. In most of these territories, this was their only hit single, as the follow-up single &quot;Sunny&quot; failed to chart.

===Background and release===
In December 2001, Mark J. Klak and Mirko Jacob of Boogie Pimps decided to cover the song after watching the 1998 film &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, in which &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; is featured. The band&#x27;s result initially failed to attract attention from German record labels, but the song soon became popular via underground white label releases. It was then picked up by German label Superstar Recordings and released as an official single on April 7, 2003. In the United Kingdom, it was released on January 5, 2004, while in Australia, it was issued as a CD single on January 26, 2004.

Jefferson Aiplane&#x27;s studio release was used at the beginning of the Coen brothers&#x27; &quot;A Serious Man&quot;, just after the opening short story about the &quot;dybbuk&quot; and the title graphic. The Coens invited their longtime musical scorer, Carter Burwell, to compose a musical bridge for the title graphic to help transition from a pre-WWII Ashkenazi shtetl to St. Louis Park, Minnesota in 1967, where Danny Gopnik is listening to the song on an earpiece during his Hebrew language class at school. Burwell responded by adding a dark, brooding introduction to &quot;Somebody To Love&quot; using the same model electric guitar and bass used in the original studio recording, and played through similar amps by selected musicians. Referring to the sound fidelity, Burwell commented, &quot;it was difficult to reduce our overall sound quality to that of the original recording. We did our best.&quot;

<text>&quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; is a song by the British rock band Queen. Written by bassist John Deacon, the song was featured on the group&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;The Game&quot; (1980). It was a worldwide hit, charting at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for three weeks, from 4 October to 18 October (being their second and final number-one single in the country). The song spent 15 weeks in the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 10 (the longest running top ten song of 1980), including 13 weeks in the top five, and 31 weeks total on the chart (more than any other song in 1980). It reached number two on the Hot Soul Singles chart and the Disco Top 100 chart, and number seven on the UK Singles Chart. The song is credited as Queen&#x27;s best-selling single, with sales of over 7 million copies. This version was ranked at number 34 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s All-Time Top Songs&quot;.

The song won an American Music Award for Favorite Rock Single and also garnered a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; has been covered, remixed and sampled by many artists since its release, and has also appeared in TV shows, commercials, films and other media. The song has also featured at sports events.

==History==
It is purported that John Deacon&#x27;s bass line was inspired by &quot;Good Times&quot; by the disco group Chic. In an interview with &quot;NME&quot;, Chic co-founder Bernard Edwards stated, &quot;That Queen record came about because that Queen bass player... spent some time hanging out with us at our studio.&quot;

Recording sessions – produced by Reinhold Mack at Musicland Studios in Munich (West Germany) – consisted of Deacon playing almost all instruments: bass guitar, piano, electric guitar, and handclaps. Roger Taylor added a drum loop and Brian May contributed noises with his guitar and an Eventide Harmonizer. There are no synthesisers in the song: all effects are created by piano, electric guitars and drums, with subsequent tape playback performed in reverse at various speeds. Finally, sound effects were run through the harmonizer for further processing. The effect of the harmonizer can be heard clearly in the &quot;swirling&quot; nature of the sound immediately before the first lyric. In early live performances, Taylor sang lead on the chorus, as opposed to the studio version sung entirely by Mercury. As the song became more well-known, the band could rely on audiences to sing the chorus by themselves. After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles, Michael Jackson suggested to Freddie Mercury backstage that &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; be released as a single.

At the 1981 American Music Awards on 30 January, &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single. The song also garnered Queen a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. It lost to Bob Seger&#x27;s &quot;Against the Wind&quot;. The music video for &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; was filmed at Reunion Arena in Dallas, Texas on 9 August 1980. The song also appears in Queen&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in 1981.

To &quot;bite the dust&quot; means to die or to lose in a contest or game. The beginning lyrics set up a scene similar to a mobster movie, with &quot;machine guns ready to go&quot;. Later lyrics refer to a failed relationship as &quot;another one bites the dust&quot;. The singer is not going to let it get him down, &quot;standing on my own two feet&quot;. The song was used in a preliminary cut of &quot;Rocky III&quot;, before being replaced by Survivor&#x27;s &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;. &quot;When one of my idols, Brian May, attended one of our shows in Los Angeles in 1984, he brought up that subject&quot;, recalled Survivor guitarist Frankie Sullivan, to whom Sylvester Stallone had supplied a copy of the movie. &quot;I offered to send him a copy of the tape, which I still own.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; called it a &quot;snarling track&quot; with a &quot;spare, lean sound.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;a brutal bass conspires with the sing-along hook on this thoroughly contagious [song].&quot; &quot;Classic Rock History&quot; critic Millie Zeiler rated it John Deacon&#x27;s 2nd best Queen song.

==Alleged backward masking==

In the early 1980s, &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; was one of many popular rock songs that some Christian evangelists alleged contained subliminal messages through a technique called backmasking. It was claimed that the chorus, when played in reverse, can be heard as &quot;Decide to smoke marijuana&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s fun to smoke marijuana&quot;, or &quot;Start to smoke marijuana&quot;. A spokeswoman for Hollywood Records (Queen&#x27;s current US label) has denied that the song contains such a message. The song does, however, contain a backmasked piano, which can be heard clearly when it is played backward.

==Use in medical training==
&quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; was used in a study to train medical professionals to provide the correct number of chest compressions per minute while performing CPR. The bassline has close to 110 beats per minute, and 100–120 chest compressions per minute are recommended by the British Heart Foundation, and endorsed by the Resuscitation Council (UK).

==Hollywood Records remixes==

The first official remix of &quot;Another One Bites The Dust&quot; was Phase 5&#x27;s Long Dusted B-Boy version, which was released on the Hollywood BASIC compilation &quot;BASIC Beats Sampler&quot; in early 1992. The remix featured a new rap verse by Money-B of Raw Fusion and contained many samples from other records including, but not limited to, &quot;Flash&quot; by Queen themselves, &quot;The Breaks&quot; by Kurtis Blow, &quot;I Know You Got Soul&quot; by Eric B. &amp; Rakim, &quot;Good Times&quot; by Chic and &quot;It&#x27;s Too Funky in Here&quot; by James Brown. 

Dave Ogilvie edited the Phase 5 remix for inclusion on the April 1992 compilation &quot;BASIC Queen Bootlegs&quot; removing profanity from the rap verse and problematic samples due to copyright clearance. A separate remix by Onyx producer ChySkillz was due to appear featuring rap verses by Ice Cube, Hi-C and Manson. Ogilvie also recorded his own remix in sessions for the album, but did this not feature on the final track listing. All four versions have since leaked.

==Wyclef Jean remix==
In 1998, Haitian rapper Wyclef Jean covered and remixed the song alongside Queen for the film &quot;Small Soldiers&quot; (1998). His version also features rap verses from Pras Michel and Free. The track also appears on Queen&#x27;s compilation &quot;Greatest Hits III&quot;, released in 1999, and on Pras&#x27; debut album, &quot;Ghetto Supastar&quot;, released in 1998.

===Background===
The song enjoyed its greatest success in Queen&#x27;s native United Kingdom, where it entered and peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart, two places higher than the original, going on to spend six weeks on the chart. It also peaked within the top ten of the charts in Finland. It charted number 18, number 23, number 50 and number 62 in New Zealand, Austria, Sweden and France, respectively. The music video for this version was directed by Michel Gondry. 

The song became Pras&#x27; third top ten hit in the United Kingdom from his debut solo album &quot;Ghetto Supastar&quot;, following the title track and follow-up single &quot;Blue Angels&quot;. However, Pras was not available for the filming of the video, and rapper Canibus recorded a new verse to take his place. This version was used only for the promotional video.

<doc id="292950" wikidata="Q178905" url="?curid=292950" title="Crazy Little Thing Called Love">
<text>&quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; is a song by the British rock band Queen. Written by Freddie Mercury in 1979, the track is included on their 1980 album &quot;The Game&quot;, and also appears on the band&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; in 1981. The song peaked at number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1979 and became the group&#x27;s first number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US in 1980, remaining there for four consecutive weeks. It topped the Australian ARIA Charts for seven weeks. It was the band&#x27;s final single release of the 1970s.

Having composed &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; on guitar, Mercury played rhythm guitar while performing the song live, which was the first time he played guitar in concert with Queen. Queen played the song live between 1979 and 1986, and a live performance of the song is recorded in the albums &quot;Queen Rock Montreal&quot;, &quot;Queen on Fire – Live at the Bowl&quot;, &quot;Live at Wembley &#x27;86&quot; and &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody: Queen Live in Budapest&quot;. Since its release, the song has been covered by a number of artists. The song was played live on 20 April 1992 during The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, performed by Robert Plant with Queen. The style of the song was described by author Karl Coryat as rockabilly in his 1999 book titled &quot;The Bass Player Book&quot;.

==Composition==
As reported by Freddie Mercury in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, 2 May 1981, he composed &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; on the guitar in just five to ten minutes.

The song was written by Mercury as a tribute to his musical heroes Elvis Presley and Cliff Richard. Roger Taylor added in an interview that Mercury wrote it in just 10 minutes while lounging in a bath in the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich during one of their extensive Munich recording sessions, which was later confirmed by Mercury himself. Mercury took it to the studio shortly after writing it and presented it to Taylor and John Deacon. The three of them, with their then new producer Reinhold Mack, recorded it at Musicland Studios in Munich. The entire song was reportedly recorded in less than half an hour (although Mack says it was six hours). 

Having written &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; on guitar and played an acoustic rhythm guitar on the record, for the first time ever Mercury played guitar in concerts, for example at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, London in 1985. &quot;Billboard&quot; described Brian May&#x27;s guitar playing as being &quot;stunning in its simplicity&quot;. &quot;Cash Box&quot; called it a &quot;hip shakin&#x27; rockabilly romp&quot; and an &quot;upbeat tune&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; said that the band &quot;does a superb job of capturing the spirit and sound of the late &#x27;50s be-bop rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot;.

May wanted to emulate Rick Nelson&#x27;s and Presley&#x27;s longtime guitarist James Burton, and at Macks&#x27;s suggestion used a Fender Esquire rather than his regular Red Special for the recording session.

==Music video==
The music video for the song was filmed at Trillion Studios on 21 September 1979 and directed by Dennis De Vallance involving four dancers and a floor of hands. An alternate version was included on the &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; DVD and Blu-ray releases.

==Live performances==
In the immediate aftermath of the single the band embarked on a mini UK tour entitled the Crazy Tour.

Whenever the song was played live, the band added a solid rock ending that extended the under-three-minute track to over five minutes, with May and Mercury providing additional guitars. An example of this is on the CD/DVD Set &quot;Live at Wembley &#x27;86&quot;, where the song continues for five minutes.

On 13 July 1985, Queen performed the song for the Live Aid dual-venue benefit concert.

== Single release ==
The &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; single hit number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, and became the first US number-one hit for the band, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for four weeks. It was knocked out of the top spot on this chart by Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part II&quot;. The song also topped the Australian ARIA charts for seven consecutive weeks from 1 March to 12 April 1980. The UK release had &quot;We Will Rock You (live)&quot; as the b-side and America, Australia, Canada had &quot;Spread Your Wings (live)&quot;.

==Personnel==
*Freddie Mercury – lead and backing vocals, acoustic rhythm guitar, hand claps
*Brian May – backing vocals, electric lead guitar, hand claps
*Roger Taylor – backing vocals, drums, hand claps
*John Deacon – bass guitar, hand claps
Although Mercury played an acoustic-electric twelve-string Ovation Pacemaker 1615 guitar and later on an electric six-string Fender Telecaster (both owned by May) live, he recorded the studio version of the song using a six-string acoustic with external mics. Mercury also played the original guitar solo on a version which has been lost.

==Dwight Yoakam version==

American country music singer Dwight Yoakam included a cover of the song on his 1999 album &quot;Last Chance for a Thousand Years: Dwight Yoakam&#x27;s Greatest Hits from the 90&#x27;s&quot;. Yoakam&#x27;s version was released as a single. It debuted at number 65 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; &quot;Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks&quot; chart for the week of 1 May 1999, and peaked at number 12 on the US country singles charts that year. It was also used in a television commercial for clothing retailer Gap at the time of the album&#x27;s release. The music video was directed by Yoakam. This version appears in the movie &quot;&quot; (2006), starring Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston.

<text>The Manxman is a 1929 British silent romance film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Anny Ondra, Carl Brisson and Malcolm Keen. The film is based on a popular 1894 romantic novel &quot;The Manxman&quot; by Hall Caine, which had previously been made into a film 13 years earlier. It was the last fully silent production that Hitchcock directed before he made the transition to sound film with his next film &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929).

==Cast==
* Carl Brisson as Pete Quilliam
* Malcolm Keen as Philip Christian
* Anny Ondra as Kate Cregeen
* Randle Ayrton as Caesar Cregeen
* Clare Greet as Mother (as Claire Greet)
* Harry Terry as Man (uncredited)
* Kim Peacock as Ross Christian (uncredited)
* Wilfred Shine as Doctor (uncredited)
* Nellie Richards as Wardress (uncredited)

==Plot==

The film tells the story of two close childhood friends, a handsome but poor fisherman, Pete Quilliam (Carl Brisson), and a well-educated middle-class lawyer, Philip Christian (Malcolm Keen); Both the young men are smitten with beautiful and lively Kate (Anny Ondra), the pub owner&#x27;s daughter. In Pete&#x27;s case, Kate is also interested in him, or at least she enjoys having him as a suitor.

Pete proposes, asking Philip to make the case to Kate&#x27;s dour father, Caesar Cregeen (Randle Ayrton). Cregeen refuses to consent to the marriage, because Pete is penniless. Pete decides to go to Africa to make his fortune, so he will be considered eligible to marry her, and he asks Kate if she will wait for him to return. At first she jokes around, but finally she says yes. Pete then asks Philip to take care of Kate until he returns.

In his absence, Philip starts calling on Kate almost every day. Kate and Philip become strongly attracted to one another, and start an affair while visiting an old mill.

News reaches the village that Pete has been killed in Africa. Philip and Kate are shocked but Kate is relieved to realize that they can now plan their lives together. Philip&#x27;s career has been going well, and he is preparing to assume the powerful position of Deemster, the island&#x27;s chief magistrate.

However, it then turns out that a dead man was misidentified as Pete, who is still alive and prospering in Africa. He lets Philip know via telegram that he is returning. Philip urges Kate not to break her promise to marry Pete, allowing him to continue with his career. Pete arrives shortly after the telegram and is extremely happy to be back to his village and see his old sweetheart. Old Caesar is now delighted to agree to Kate marrying Pete. The wedding reception is celebrated in the old mill, where Old Caesar sternly warns the newlyweds to remember that God will punish anyone who violates the vows of marriage.

Kate is still in love with Philip, and can hardly bear to be married to Pete.

As the weeks pass, Pete is thrilled to find out that Kate is pregnant, and he naturally assumes he is the father. When Kate&#x27;s daughter is born, Kate is desperate and decides to leave Pete. She walks out, leaving her baby behind, and a note saying that she had loved another man, and still loves him. Pete is deeply hurt by this, but puts on a brave face and tells the villagers that Kate has gone to London for a short rest. During the weeks she is gone, Pete proves himself to be a wonderful father, taking care of the baby very well, and comforting himself by believing that although Kate has gone, he still has their baby to love.

Kate persuades Philip to hide her at his law offices, hoping she can still somehow have a life with him. However, Philip is about to become the Deemster, and he is unwilling to ruin his career by running off with her. Frustrated and distraught, Kate returns to the house to take the baby. She tells Pete he is not the baby&#x27;s father. Pete is stunned and refuses to believe her. He also refuses to give up the child. In desperation, Kate leaves the house and tries to commit suicide by throwing herself off the quay, but is rescued by a policeman. Attempted suicide is classified as a crime, and Kate is brought to trial on the first day that Philip serves as Deemster. Now Philip is stunned and hardly knows what to do. When Pete appears in the courtroom to plead for his wife, Philip agrees to hand Kate over to him. But Kate refuses to go. Kate&#x27;s father, Old Caesar, who is watching carefully, finally understands that Kate and Philip had an affair. Philip publicly admits his extreme moral failings. He removes his wig and surrenders his official position, and then leaves the court.

In the final scene, Philip and Kate arrive at Pete&#x27;s house to take away the baby. Kate picks up the child, while Philip and Pete stand at opposite ends of the room. She brings the child over to Pete to say one last goodbye, and he breaks down. Philip and Kate leave the cottage to the jeers and condemnation of the villagers, who have been watching the scene through the windows.

Having lost everything, Pete sets sail again.

==Production==
&quot;The Manxman&quot; began filming on the Isle of Man, but Hitchcock eventually relocated production to Polperro, Cornwall due to frequent creative interference from author Hall Caine, who lived on the Isle of Man. Other scenes were shot at British International Pictures&#x27; Elstree Studios, to which Caine was invited to observe. The director began work on the film just two weeks after the birth of his daughter Patricia Hitchcock.

==Preservation and home media==
A restoration of &quot;The Manxman&quot; was completed in 2012 as part of the BFI&#x27;s £2 million &quot;Save the Hitchcock 9&quot; project to restore all of the director&#x27;s surviving silent films.

&quot;The Manxman&quot; has been heavily bootlegged on home video. Various licensed, restored releases have appeared on DVD, Blu-ray and video on demand services from Optimum in the UK, Lionsgate and Kino Lorber in the US, and many others.

At the end of 2024, &quot;The Manxman&quot; will enter the public domain in the United States. Due to differing copyright laws, &#x27;The Manxman&#x27; will not enter the public domain in the Isle of Man, nor the UK until 2050 (70 years after the death of the director).

<doc id="292957" wikidata="Q17004679" url="?curid=292957" title="Performance rights organisation">
<text>A performance rights organisation (PRO), also known as a performing rights society, provides intermediary functions, particularly collection of royalties, between copyright holders and parties who wish to use copyrighted works &quot;publicly&quot; in locations such as shopping and dining venues. Legal consumer purchase of works, such as buying CDs from a music store, confer &quot;private&quot; performance rights. PROs usually only collect royalties when use of a work is incidental to an organisation&#x27;s purpose. Royalties for works essential to an organisation&#x27;s purpose, such as theaters and radio, are usually negotiated directly with the rights holder. The interest of the organisations varies: many have the sole focus of musical works, while others may also encompass works and authors for audiovisual, drama, literature, or the visual arts.

In some countries PROs are called [[copyright collective]]s or copyright collecting agencies. A copyright collective is more general than a PRO as it is not limited to performances and includes
reproduction rights organisations (RROs). RROs represent works distributed via mediums such as CD, audiocassette, or computer file rather than use of works in public settings. 

The global governing body for PROs is CISAC headquartered in France, with 228 member societies in 119 countries. 

==History==
The first performing rights society was established in France in 1851. In the United Kingdom, the Copyright Act 1842 was the first to protect musical compositions with the Performing Right Society, founded in 1914 encompassing live performances. The rights for recorded or broadcast performance are administered by the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society, founded in 1924. Italy introduced a performing rights society in 1882 and Germany in 1915. In the United States, The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) was founded in 1914; Society of European Stage Authors &amp; Composers (SESAC) in 1930 and Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) in 1939.
Sociedad Puertorriqueña de Autores y Compositores de Musica (SPACEM) was founded in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1953. SPACEM&#x27;s name was changed to ACEMLA, or Asociacion de Compositoes y Editores de Musica and remains today PRO No. 76 in the CISAC&#x27;s roster of performing rights societies.

==Activities==
Other than their primary purpose as an intermediary between rights holders and customers, PROs are highly active in legal arenas. PROs take alleged rights violators to court, or in the U.S., to the Copyright Royalty Board, of the Library of Congress. PROs lobby on behalf of rights holders, especially in discussions of legal royalty rates.

As a side benefit of tracking public performance of works for royalty collection, PROs publish statistics of publicly performed works.

The licensing services provided by a PRO arguably provide advantage to customers, who can simultaneously license all works the PRO represents.

==Criticisms==
PROs have been criticised for charging non-profit organisations for their use of copyrighted music in situations where the non-profit organisation was not earning money from the use. ASCAP, for example, was eventually forced in the face of public opinion to abandon its attempts to charge the Girl Scouts of the USA for singing campfire songs. ASCAP&#x27;s and SESAC&#x27;s policy of charging non-commercial educational (NCE) radio stations for playing copyrighted music has also been criticised, especially by college radio stations across the U.S., which rely entirely on student and listener support for funding and have difficulty affording the extra fees. Community Orchestras, which mostly play classical works in the public domain, may occasionally play a work within copyright, but are forced to pay licenses to rights societies on all concert revenues including concerts where all music is in the public domain, which is then distributed to songwriters of pop songs.

PROs are often criticised for stretching the definition of &quot;public performance.&quot; Until relatively recently in the U.S., playing copyrighted music in restaurants did not involve legal issues if the media was legally purchased. PROs now demand royalties for such use.

&quot;One exception to the rule allows businesses of a certain size (stores under 2,000 square feet, restaurants or bars under 3,750 square feet) to play music from a radio, television, or similar household device without a license, provided there are fewer than six speakers (with limits on the placement of speakers), and customers aren&#x27;t charged to listen. Other exceptions include educational and charitable functions... If your business falls into one of the categories listed above (size of business, number and placement of speakers, etc.) radio/TV] you may want to check out section 110(5) of the Copyright Act. As you likely won&#x27;t need a license. But, before making a decision, check with a lawyer.&quot;

By discouraging performances in limited public arenas, again using the restaurant example, critics say PROs eliminate the free publicity such performances provide for a work thereby depressing media sales. Incidentally, lower media sales conflict with PROs, but disputes between the two parties are not known to occur since each type of organisation represents the interests of the same parties - rights owners - and are forced to work in common interest.

Rights owners – especially independents and newcomers not represented by large publishing companies – criticise the PROs for what they deem to be &quot;mystical&quot; formulas for deciding who gets what share of the total licensing revenue received. They also criticise PROs for slow or non-existent payments and excessive membership dues or service fees.

Most countries (that observe copyright) have the equivalent:

==State regulation and income taxes==

Although the Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution delegates the power to establish Copyright law in the United States, in recent years, a number of States have enacted transparency laws in respect to Performing Rights Societies. These generally force Performing Rights Societies to discloses the musical works they license. Because many establishments pay blanket license fees to Performing Rights Societies but have little or no idea if the fees they pay actually secure the rights to perform musical works. This can result in unfair business practices called tolling. Many performing rights societies send representatives into businesses who attempt to disrupt or shut down a concert, claiming an insufficient or performing right license, and some states have banned this practice.

Moreover, states with income taxes hope to withhold royalty income for &quot;performances&quot; inside those states rather than in the state where a composer/songwriter lives or the Performing Rights Society is located. In practice, state income tax accounting is very difficult to regulate. Notable is Colorado&#x27;s law, which requires each Performing Rights Society to disclose its entire catalog.

<text>Earl of Bristol is a title that has been created twice in British history, and was attested once before. Antiquaries Carew and Williams refer to Reginald de Dunstanville (–1175, the illegitimate son of King Henry I) as Earl of Bristol. However, the first confirmed creation came in the Peerage of England in 1622 in favour of the politician and diplomat John Digby who served for many years as Ambassador to Spain, and had already been created Baron Digby of Sherborne, in the County of Dorset, in 1618, also in the Peerage of England. Digby was the brother of Sir Robert Digby of Coleshill, Warwickshire, whose son Robert Digby became 1st Baron Digby of Geashill in the Peerage of Ireland in 1620. (See the article Baron Digby for more information on this other branch of the family).

He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was a prominent statesman and served as Secretary of State for King Charles I. In 1641 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Digby of Sherborne. When he died the titles passed to his son, the third Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Dorset and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Dorset. He was childless and the titles became extinct on his death in 1698.

The second creation of the earldom came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1714 for John Hervey. For more information on this creation, see Marquess of Bristol.

<text>Thomas Ernest Bennett &quot;Tibby&quot; Clarke, OBE (7 June 1907 – 11 February 1989) was a film screenwriter who wrote several of the Ealing Studios comedies.

==Early life==
Clarke was born in Watford on 7 June 1907. His father, Ernest Clarke, had been raised in Hull, moving to South Africa in the late 19th century. He was enlisted to carry dispatches for the Jameson Raid though, avoiding imprisonment, managed to obtain a job working for a gold mining company. Ernest then married Madeline Gardiner, with whom he raised three children. Their eldest child was Dudley Clarke, who would later become a pioneer of military deception operations during the Second World War. A girl, Dollie, followed. 

The gold mining company Ernest had been working for then offered him an opportunity to move to their London office, enabling him to return to England with his young family. They sailed from South Africa, the first ship to leave the country following the end of the Boer War. Upon arriving in England, Ernest purchased a house in Watford, where Madeline gave birth to their third and final child, Thomas Ernest Bennett Clarke.

Always known as &quot;Tibby&quot;, Clarke attended Charterhouse School and Clare College, Cambridge, where he studied law for a year before departing after impersonating a proctor and booking students for being out after dark without a cap and gown. He then visited Australia, New Zealand, San Francisco, and Canada, returning to England to work as a journalist for, in succession, the &quot;Hardware Trade Journal&quot;, the weekly magazine &quot;Answers&quot;, and &quot;The Daily Sketch&quot; tabloid newspaper. After gaining temporary employment as a publicity officer for the W. S. Crawford Advertising Agency in the late 1920s, he came into contact with the film industry for the first time.

==Film career==
Clarke&#x27;s first screen credit was for heavily modifying the script of &quot;For Those in Peril&quot; in 1944, followed by proper contributions to &quot;The Halfway House&quot; (1944) and &quot;Johnny Frenchman&quot; (1945). His scripts always featured careful logical development from a slightly absurd premise to a farcical conclusion. In 1952, he was awarded a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for his script for &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot;, making him one of just a handful of Britons to receive this award. He continued to work as a scriptwriter after Ealing ceased production, his later contributions including &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; and the Disney film &quot;The Horse Without a Head&quot;.

Clarke was also a novelist and writer of non-fiction, but presented at least one fictional work as fact. His book &quot;Murder at Buckingham Palace&quot; (1981) purports to tell the story of a hushed-up murder at the Royal residence in 1935. Despite its including &#x27;documentary&#x27; photographs, there is no external evidence that the book is anything but pure fiction. For &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; (1950) he drew on his experience as a war reserve constable with the Metropolitan Police during the Second World War.

He was awarded the OBE in 1952. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1960 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.

==Animal welfare==

Clarke was an advocate of animal welfare and opposed coursing. He authored &quot;A Savage Sport: The Case Against Coursing&quot; for the National Society for the Abolition of Cruel Sports in 1935.

==Death==

Clarke was diagnosed with cancer in 1988. He died at London Bridge Hospital in February, 1989.

<doc id="292960" wikidata="Q326487" url="?curid=292960" title="We Will Rock You">
<text>&quot;We Will Rock You&quot; is a song by the British rock band Queen from their 1977 album &quot;News of the World&quot;, written by guitarist Brian May. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 330 of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; in 2004, and the RIAA it placed at number 146 on the Songs of the Century list in 2001. In 2009, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Other than the last 30 seconds, which contains a guitar solo by May, the song is generally set in a cappella form, using only stomping and clapping as a rhythmic body percussion beat. In 1977, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; were issued together as a worldwide top 10 single. Soon after the album was released, many radio stations played the songs consecutively, without interruption.

Since its release, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; has been covered, remixed, sampled, parodied, referred to, and used by multiple recording artists, TV shows, films and other media worldwide. It has also become a popular stadium anthem at sports events around the world, mostly due to its simple rhythm. On 7 October 2017, Queen released a Raw Sessions version of the track to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the release of &quot;News of the World&quot;. It features a radically different approach to the guitar solo and includes May&#x27;s count-in immediately prior to the recording.

==Music==
&quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; were written in response to an event that occurred during the A Day at the Races Tour. The band played at Stafford&#x27;s Bingley Hall, and, according to Brian May:

One version was used as the opening track on 1977&#x27;s &quot;News of the World&quot;. This consists of a stomp-stomp-clap-pause beat, and a power chorus, being somewhat of an anthem. The stamping effects were created by the band overdubbing the sounds of themselves stomping on the Wessex drum riser and clapping many times and adding delay effects to make it sound like many people were participating. The durations of the delays were in the ratios of prime numbers, a technique now known as non-harmonic reverberation. A tape loop is used to repeat the last phrase of the guitar solo three times as opposed to Brian May playing it three separate times on the recording. The &quot;stomp, stomp, clap&quot; sounds were later used in the Queen + Paul Rodgers song &quot;Still Burnin&#x27;&quot;.

When performed live, the song is usually followed by &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, as they were designed to run together. The songs are often paired on the radio and at sporting events, where they are frequently played. They were the last two songs Queen performed at Live Aid in 1985.

==We Will Rock You - fast version==
Queen also performed an alternative version of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; known as the &quot;fast version&quot;, featuring a faster-feeling tempo and a full band arrangement. The band would frequently use this version to open their live sets in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as heard on the albums &quot;Live Killers&quot; (1979), &quot;Queen on Fire - Live at the Bowl&quot; (2004), &quot;Queen Rock Montreal&quot; (2007), and the expanded edition of &quot;News of the World&quot; (2011).

A studio version was made for John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show at the Maida Vale Studios on 28 October 1977 and first broadcast soon after on 14 November. It includes a separate section that begins with an abridged session version of the original comprising the first verse, chorus and guitar outro - this part has become known as We Will Rock You (slow). Between the two parts there is a brief reading of Hermann Hesse&#x27;s novel &quot;Siddhartha&quot;, used in a BBC Radio documentary. This audio was found on the BBC tapes being reused to record the session and was retained by the band.

This full BBC session version of We Will Rock You was broadcast on Alan Freeman&#x27;s Final Saturday Rock Show on Radio 1 on 26 August 1978, has also been played on Radio 1&#x27;s The Friday Rock Show and more recently on Johnie Walker&#x27;s Sounds Of The Seventies and Vernon Kay&#x27;s weekday morning show, both on BBC Radio 2.

The fast version is also used as the curtain call music for the musical of the same title, after the finale, which is a pairing of the original &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;. In 2002, the fast version was officially released on a promo single distributed by the tabloid &quot;The Sun&quot;, and can also be found on &quot;The Best of King Biscuit Live Volume 4&quot;, and &quot;In The Mirror - The Lost BBC Sessions&quot;.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; was filmed in 1978 at the back garden of Roger Taylor&#x27;s mansion. It sees the band lip synching the song, hand clapping with gloves and foot stomping on a frozen ground. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Taylor spoke on filming the video:

==Notable cover versions==
===Five + Queen version===
British boy band Five released a cover of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; on 17 July 2000. It was the fourth single released from their second studio album, &quot;Invincible&quot; (1999). The song contains rap verses from Five&#x27;s members Jason &quot;J&quot; Brown and Richard &quot;Abs&quot; Breen, and features two members of Queen: Brian May on guitar and Roger Taylor on drums (only on the single version); however, they do not sing any vocals on the track. Freddie Mercury had died in November 1991, nearly a decade before this version&#x27;s release, and John Deacon had retired from public life three years before the release of the Five cover.

The song charted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, making it Five&#x27;s second number-one single, and their ninth consecutive top-ten hit.

<text>Maracanã Stadium (, ), officially named Journalist [[Mário Filho]] Stadium (Portuguese: &quot;Estádio Jornalista Mario Filho&quot;; ), is an association football stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The stadium is part of a complex that includes an arena known by the name of &quot;Maracanãzinho&quot;, which means &quot;The Little Maracanã&quot; in Portuguese. Owned by the Rio de Janeiro state government, the stadium is now managed by the clubs Fluminense and Flamengo. It is located in the Maracanã neighborhood, named after the Rio Maracanã, a now canalized river in Rio de Janeiro.

The stadium was opened in 1950 to host the FIFA World Cup, in which Brazil was beaten 2–1 by Uruguay in the deciding game, in front of a still standing record attendance of 173,850 spectators, on 16 July 1950. The venue has seen attendances of 150,000 or more at 26 occasions and has seen crowds of more than 100,000 as many as 284 times. But as terraced sections have been replaced with seats over time, and after the renovation for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, its original capacity has been reduced to the current 73,139, but it remains the largest stadium in Brazil and the third largest in South America after Estadio Monumental in Argentina and Estadio Monumental in Peru. Fluminense and Flamengo still own the all-time club record attendance, with 194,603 spectators supporting its clubs in the world famous Fla–Flu derby in 1963.

The stadium is mainly used for football matches between the major football clubs in Rio de Janeiro, including Fluminense, Flamengo, Botafogo, and Vasco da Gama. It has also hosted a number of concerts and other sporting events. It was the main venue for the 2007 Pan American Games, hosting the football tournament and the opening and closing ceremonies. The Maracanã was partially rebuilt in preparation for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 World Cup, for which it hosted several matches, including the final. It is also set to host matches for the 2027 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, most likely to host the final. It served as the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, with the main track and field events taking place at the Estádio Olímpico. The stadium was also chosen to host the 2020 and 2023 Copa Libertadores finals.

==Name==
The stadium was named in 1966 in honor of the recently deceased Mário Filho, a Pernambucan sports journalist, the brother of Nelson Rodrigues, who was a strong vocal supporter of the construction of the Maracanã.

The stadium&#x27;s popular name is derived from the Maracanã River, whose point of origin is in the jungle-covered hills to the west, crossing various &quot;bairros&quot; (neighborhoods) of Rio&#x27;s &quot;Zona Norte&quot; (North Zone), such as Tijuca and São Cristóvão, via a drainage canal which features sloping sides constructed of concrete. Upon flowing into the &quot;Canal do Mangue&quot;, it empties into Guanabara Bay. The name &quot;Maracanã&quot; derives from the indigenous Tupi–Guarani word for a type of parrot which inhabited the region. The stadium construction was prior to the formation of the later Maracanã neighborhood, that was once part of Tijuca.

The stadium of Red Star Belgrade, the Red Star Stadium, is popularly called &quot;Marakana&quot; in honor of the Brazilian stadium.

In March 2021, the Rio de Janeiro state legislature voted to change the venue&#x27;s name to the Edson Arantes do Nascimento - Rei Pele stadium. Edson Arantes do Nascimento was the 82-year-old&#x27;s full name, while Rei means king in Portuguese. The Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s state governor must approve the name change before it becomes official.

==History==

===Construction===
After winning the right to host the 1950 FIFA World Cup, the Brazilian government sought to build a new stadium for the tournament. The construction of Maracanã was criticized by Carlos Lacerda, then Congressman and political enemy of the mayor of the city, general Ângelo Mendes de Morais, for the expense and for the chosen location of the stadium, arguing that it should be built in the West Zone neighborhood of Jacarepaguá. At the time, a tennis stadium stood in the chosen area. Still it was supported by journalist Mário Filho, and Mendes de Morais was able to move the project forward. The competition for the design and construction was opened by the municipality of Rio de Janeiro in 1947, with the construction contract awarded to engineer Humberto Menescal, and the architectural contract awarded to seven Brazilian architects, Michael Feldman, Waldir Ramos, Raphael Galvão, Oscar Valdetaro, Orlando Azevedo, Pedro Paulo Bernardes Bastos, and Antônio Dias Carneiro.

The first cornerstone was laid at the site of the stadium on 2 August 1948. With the first World Cup game scheduled to be played on 24 June 1950, this left a little under two years to finish construction. However, work quickly fell behind schedule, prompting FIFA to send Ottorino Barassi, the head of the Italian FA, who had organized the 1934 World Cup, to help in Rio de Janeiro. A workforce of 1,500 constructed the stadium, with an additional 2,000 working in the final months. Despite the stadium having come into use in 1950, the construction was only fully completed in 1965.

=== Opening and 1950 FIFA World Cup ===
The opening match of the stadium took place on 16 June 1950. Rio de Janeiro All-Stars beat São Paulo All-Stars 3–1; Didi became the player to score the first ever goal at the stadium. While the major part of the stadium was finished, it still looked like a construction site; it lacked toilet facilities and a press box. Brazilian officials claimed it could seat over 200,000 people, while the Guinness Book of World Records estimated it could seat 180,000 and other sources pegged capacity at 155,000. What is beyond dispute is that Maracanã overtook Hampden Park as the largest stadium in the world. Despite the stadium&#x27;s unfinished state, FIFA allowed matches to be played at the venue, and on 24 June 1950, the first World Cup match took place, with 81,000 spectators in attendance.

In that first match for which Maracanã had been built, Brazil beat Mexico with a final score 4–0, with Ademir becoming the first scorer of a competitive goal at the stadium with his 30th-minute strike. Ademir had two goals in total, plus one each from Baltasar and Jair. The match was refereed by Englishman George Reader. Five of Brazil&#x27;s six games at the tournament were played at Maracanã (the exception being their 2–2 draw with Switzerland in São Paulo). Eventually, Brazil progressed to the final round, facing Uruguay in the match (part of a round-robin final phase) that turned out to be the tournament-deciding match on 16 July 1950. Brazil only needed a draw to finish as champion, but Uruguay won the game 2–1, shocking and silencing the massive crowd. This defeat on home soil instantly became a significant event in Brazilian history, being known popularly as the &quot;Maracanazo&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;The Maracanã Smash&quot;). The official attendance of the final game was 199,854, with the actual attendance estimated to be about 210,000. In any case, it was the largest crowd ever to see a football game—a record that is highly unlikely to be threatened in an era when most international matches are played in all-seater stadiums. At the time of the World Cup, the stadium was mostly grandstands with no individual seats.

===Stadium completion and post-World Cup years===

Since the World Cup in 1950, Maracanã Stadium has mainly been used for club games involving four major football clubs in Rio — Vasco, Botafogo, Flamengo and Fluminense. The stadium has also hosted numerous domestic football cup finals, most notably the Copa do Brasil and the Campeonato Carioca. On 21 March 1954, a new official attendance record was set in the game between Brazil and Paraguay, after 183,513 spectators entered the stadium with a ticket and 194,603 (177,656 p.) in Fla-Flu (1963). In 1963, stadium authorities replaced the square goal posts with round ones, but it was still two years before the stadium would be fully completed. In 1965, 17 years after construction began, the stadium was finally finished. In September 1966, upon the death of Mário Rodrigues Filho, the Brazilian journalist, columnist, sports figure, and prominent campaigner who was largely responsible for the stadium originally being built, the administrators of the stadium renamed the stadium after him: &quot;Estádio Jornalista Mário Rodrigues Filho&quot;. However, the nickname of &quot;Maracanã&quot; has continued to be used as the common referent. In 1969, Pelé scored the 1,000th goal of his career at Maracanã, against CR Vasco da Gama in front of 65,157 spectators.

In 1989, the stadium hosted the games of the final round of the Copa America; in the same year, Zico scored his final goal for Flamengo at the Maracanã, taking his goal tally at the stadium to 333, a record that still stood as of 2021. An upper stand in the stadium collapsed on 19 July 1992, in the second game of the finals of 1992 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, between Botafogo and Flamengo, leading to the death of three spectators and injuring 50 others. Following the disaster, the stadium&#x27;s capacity was greatly reduced as it was converted to an all-seater stadium in the late 1990s. Meanwhile, the ground was classified as a national landmark in 1998, meaning that it could not be demolished. The stadium hosted the first ever FIFA Club World Cup final match between CR Vasco da Gama and Corinthians Paulista, which Corinthians won on penalties.

===21st century, renovations and 2014 FIFA World Cup===

Following its 50th anniversary in 2000, the stadium underwent renovations which would increase its full capacity to around 103,000. After years of planning and nine months of closure between 2005 and 2006, the stadium was reopened in January 2007 with an all-seated capacity of 87,000.

For the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics and Paralympics, a major reconstruction project was initiated in 2010. The original seating bowl, with a two-tier configuration, was demolished, giving way to a new one-tier seating bowl. The original stadium&#x27;s roof in concrete was removed and replaced with a fiberglass tensioned membrane coated with polytetra-fluoroethylene. The new roof covers 95% of the seats inside the stadium, unlike the former design, where protection was only afforded to some seats in the upper ring and the bleachers above the gate access of each sector. The old boxes, which were installed at a level above the stands for the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, were dismantled in the reconstruction process. The new seats are colored yellow, blue and white, which combined with the green of the playing field form the Brazilian national colors. In addition, the grayish tone has returned as the main façade color of the stadium.

On 30 May 2013, a friendly game between Brazil and England scheduled for 2 June was called off by a local judge because of safety concerns related to the stadium. The government of Rio de Janeiro appealed the decision and the game went ahead as originally planned, the final score being a 2–2 draw. This match marked the reopening of the new Maracanã.

On 12 June 2014, the 2014 FIFA World Cup opened with host nation Brazil defeating Croatia 3–1, but that match was held at Arena Corinthians in São Paulo. The first game of the World Cup to be held in Maracanã was a 2–1 victory by Argentina over Bosnia and Herzegovina on Sunday, 15 June 2014. Brazil ended up never playing a match in the Maracanã during the tournament, as they failed to reach the final after a 7–1 defeat to Germany in the semi-finals.

===Disrepair after the 2016 Summer Olympics===

The stadium lay dormant in the months after the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics, with photos surfacing in early 2017 of a dried-up playing field covered in brown spots and missing turf, ripped-out seats, and damage to windows and doors. A debt of R$3 million (US$939,937) to the local energy company led to power being shut off at Maracanã. At the heart of the issue was a legal wrangling between the stadium&#x27;s owner, operator, and the organizing committee for the Rio Olympics over responsibility for maintaining the grounds. Maracanã SA, the operator, charges that the Olympic committee did not return the venue in an acceptable condition, while the committee says the things that they needed to fix should not keep Maracanã from operating.

Within six months of the Olympics, daily tours of the stadium were halted due to vandalism at the stadium and violent robberies in the area. Items of value were looted from the stadium including fire extinguishers, televisions, and a bronze bust of journalist Mário Filho, for whom the stadium was named.

=== New managers ===
On 5 April 2017, the French group Lagardère signed an agreement to administer the Maracanã. In total, Lagardère will invest more than R$500 million by the end of the concession, won by Odebrecht in 2013 and valid until 2048. The &quot;Folha de São Paulo&quot; newspaper informed that the group estimates that it will need to spend about R$15 million on emergency repairs to the stadium. In 2013, the former managers of Odebrecht together with AEG and IMX, a company owned by Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista, won the bid to manage the stadium for 35 years. The company was associated with Brazilian building company OAS and the Amsterdam Arena. At the time, Lagardère was in second place in the bidding.
==Non-football events==
The famous vale tudo match between Japanese judoka Masahiko Kimura and Brazilian jiu-jitsu player Hélio Gracie was held at the Maracanã on 23 October 1951. At the time many in Brazil felt that Gracie was unbeatable in martial arts, and that Kimura would not be welcomed back to Japan if he lost the bout. Kimura won via technical submission after breaking Gracie&#x27;s arm with a &quot;gyaku-ude-garami&quot; hold, which has since become known as a &quot;Kimura lock&quot; in BJJ and mixed martial arts.

===International sports competitions===

<doc id="292967" wikidata="Q2573060" url="?curid=292967" title="Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland">
<text>Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland, (5 September 164128 September 1702) was an English nobleman and politician of the Spencer family. An able and gifted statesman, his caustic temper and belief in absolute monarchy nevertheless made him numerous enemies. He was forced to flee England in 1688, but later established himself with the new regime after the Glorious Revolution of that year. Subsequently, he took on a more disinterested role as an adviser to the Crown, seeking neither office nor favour. He evinced no party loyalty, but was devoted to his country&#x27;s interests, as he saw them. By the notoriously lax standards of the Restoration Court, his private life was remarkably free from scandal, which won him favour in the more sober post-Revolution state.

==Life==

===Early life===
Robert Spencer was born in Paris in 1641. His father was Henry Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland, who was killed at the First Battle of Newbury, and his mother was the Lady Dorothy Sidney, daughter of Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester. At the age of three he inherited his father&#x27;s dignities, becoming Baron of Wormleighton and Earl of Sunderland. Lady Sunderland had him educated after his father&#x27;s death, first engaging a Calvinist tutor for him, Dr Thomas Pierce, and afterwards sending him to Christ Church, Oxford. After quitting school he joined the English Army, rising to the rank of captain in Prince Rupert&#x27;s Regiment of Horse. On 10 June 1665 he was married to Lady Anne Digby. She was the daughter of the 2nd Earl of Bristol, and died in 1715. Sunderland then served successively as ambassador to Madrid (1671–1672), Paris (1672–1673), and the United Provinces (1673). He was Gentleman of the Bedchamber from 1673 to 1679, before being invested a Privy Councillor and appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department in 1679. At the same time, he served as Ambassador Extraordinary to Paris.

His political skills and energetic character rapidly marked him as a rising man: even Bishop Burnet, who disliked him, praised his statesmanship and his &quot;quick and ready apprehension, and swift decision of business&quot;. He was accused by some of seeking and clinging to office simply for the salary, to support his reportedly extravagant lifestyle. Despite his otherwise blameless life he had a weakness for gambling, which often involved him in debt, and a passion for art. He was a collector of paintings, and made extensive alterations to Althorp, but his private life was sober, and he was personally inexpensive.

===Career under Charles II and James II===

Sunderland&#x27;s professed mission was to aggrandise England in the European community, and to strengthen her diplomatic ties with the other rivals of French power. He laboured from 1679 to 1681 to conjoin an alliance against France, but apart from a treaty with Spain in 1680, little came of it.

Sunderland&#x27;s relations with Paul Barillon, whose long tenure as Ambassador from Louis XIV (from 1677 to 1688) produced many memorable exchanges between the two, were tenuous and strained. When Louis failed to give James any assistance against the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, Sunderland told Barillon sharply &quot;the King your master may have plans I cannot discern, but I hope he will put things right by making it clear that this has all been a misunderstanding&quot;. When Barillon protested that his master&#x27;s aim was &quot;the Peace of Europe&quot; Sunderland said that it was impossible for everyone in Europe to want peace at the same time: &quot;myself I think it will last until one side or the other has a good reason for breaking it&quot;. To prevent Barillon from gaining too much influence, Sunderland intercepted and leaked an unusually indiscreet dispatch where the Ambassador boasted of having blocked an Anglo-Dutch treaty. Charles II was predictably furious, and Barillon was for a time forbidden from the Court. Sunderland remarked that if Barillon would behave himself so, it was &quot;but just that it come home to him&quot;.

Lord Sunderland also served as Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire during the minority of Lord Shrewsbury until 1681. That year, he was dismissed by Charles II, due to his opposition to the Duke of York&#x27;s succession. Presently Sunderland regained the King&#x27;s confidence (through the principal royal mistress, the Duchess of Portsmouth). Intermittently, between 1682 and 1688, he served as Secretary of State for the Southern Department, Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire, and Lord President of the Council; in 1687, he signed the King&#x27;s grant of religious freedom for the Brenttown (Brenton) tract in Prince William County, Virginia, to encourage settlement of French Protestants. The same year he openly embraced the Roman Catholic faith, insincerely, it would seem, and merely to please the King. Later that year he was made a Knight of the Garter.

However, while he enjoyed the confidence of Queen Mary of Modena, it was clear that he was growing uncomfortable under the recently enthroned James: the violently hostile reception he got from the public when he gave evidence at the Trial of the Seven Bishops left him badly shaken. When he urged James to put away his mistress Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester, James said that he had not realised Sunderland was his confessor, and told him to mind his own business for the future. Sunderland&#x27;s unpopularity was now almost universal: Burnet wrote that it was &quot;the wonder of all mankind&quot; that James continued to employ him. He was summarily dismissed at last in October 1688, with the remark, &quot;You have your pardon; much good doe it you. I hope you will be more faithful to your next master than you have been to me.&quot;

===Career under William III===

Sunderland escaped in disguise to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, where he lay low for some time, before being officially arrested, and immediately released, by the Dutch authorities. Offering his service to the Prince of Orange, he moved on to Utrecht, where he remained quietly for the duration of the upheavals in England, when William III and Mary II took the throne. Afterwards, he wrote to Sir John Churchill, a prominent English statesman, asking him to &quot;make things easy for a man in my condition&quot;. Despite his notorious rudeness and bad temper, Sunderland had a surprising ability to make lasting friendships, and some of his friends, including John Evelyn and Thomas Tenison, had influence with the new régime. His sister Dorothy had married George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax, a key adviser to William III in the early years of his reign, and though he and Sunderland had never been close, Halifax felt obliged from family solidarity to make a plea on Sunderland&#x27;s behalf. At first, William III excepted Sunderland from the Indemnity Act of 23 May 1690, but he was allowed to return to the country early the next year. At the same time, he had been excepted from James&#x27; 1692 Instrument of Pardon.
On his return, Sunderland formally reverted to Anglicanism, taking the oaths in April 1691 and quietly recommenced sitting in the House of Lords. In May William paid a visit to him at his home at Althorp, in Northamptonshire, to discuss public affairs. Over the next years, the King frequently visited him and gave him confidence, but Sunderland did not dare to fully enter public life until September 1693, when he took a house in the city. He repeatedly advised the King to select all of his ministers from one political party, and eventually effected a reconciliation between William and his sister-in-law, the later Queen Anne. He was an influential adviser, inducing William to accept only Whigs in his government. William, never vindictive, was untroubled by Sunderland&#x27;s past services to James, who had made it very clear that Sunderland was the one man he would never forgive, though he had made tentative advances towards the fallen King. Most of William&#x27;s servants had at sometime betrayed him, and he valued Sunderland for his frankness and ability to voice unwelcome truths. It has been suggested that Sunderland&#x27;s notorious rudeness actually appealed to the King, who detested flattery and could himself be distinctly rude. Once when William said that, while the Whigs personally liked him better than the Tories, the Tories were better friends to Monarchy, Sunderland shrewdly replied: &quot;but you must consider that you are not their Monarch&quot;. He even wrote a letter telling the King that if his Ministers were not fit for his service, it was his own fault for not choosing better men.

This notable lack of ordinary good manners made Sunderland countless enemies: Bishop Burnet wrote that &quot;he had too much heat, both of imagination and of passion, was apt to speak freely both of persons and things, and raised himself many enemies from a contemptuous treatment of those who differed from him&quot;. His remarkable ability to adapt to the wishes of three different monarchs was considered a fault rather than a virtue: as Burnet observed &quot;he came by this to lose so much that even those who esteemed his parts depended little on his probity&quot;.

While his own private life was blameless, Sunderland in the winter of 1697–98 became involved in a scandal when his daughter Elizabeth&#x27;s husband, Lord Clancarty, a leading Jacobite, escaped from the Tower of London. The marriage had been arranged between Sunderland and Clancarty&#x27;s uncle Justin McCarthy, Viscount Mountcashel, when the young bride was but thirteen and her husband only three years older; it had proved a disaster which greatly damaged Sunderland&#x27;s reputation. Clancarty escaped and found Elizabeth, whom he had not seen since 1684, persuading her to consummate the marriage at long last. The servants alerted her brother Charles, who had Clancarty arrested. The resulting furore gravely embarrassed Sunderland, but seems to have merely amused the King, who dryly remarked that no one wanted to speak to him of anything but &quot;that little spark Clancarty&quot;. He gave the couple permission to move to Germany, where they settled in Altona, Hamburg, and there they lived out their lives. Elizabeth never saw her parents or her brother again.

Sunderland became Lord Chamberlain of the Household in April 1697, and was a Lord Justice for a short period, but &quot;the general suspicion with which he was regarded terrified him&quot;. At the same time he was approaching sixty, a respectable age in those days, and besides his health was failing. He eventually retired from public life in December 1697.

Sunderland died in 1702. He had led a secluded life at Althorp for some time, and his only surviving son, Charles, succeeded to his titles and honours.

==Family==
He married Anne Digby, daughter of George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol, on 9 June 1665. After an awkward start, when Sunderland broke off the engagement for no known reason, the marriage was a very happy one: Lady Sunderland was rumoured to have had numerous lovers, but there is little evidence to support this, and Sunderland, despite his questionable political principles, was a devoted husband and father. They had at least five children.

*Robert Spencer (1666–1688).
*Anne Spencer (1667–1690), married James Douglas, 4th Duke of Hamilton.
*Isabella Spencer (1668–1684).
*Elizabeth Spencer (1671–1704), married Donough MacCarthy, 4th Earl of Clancarty.
*Charles Spencer (c. 1674–1722), succeeded as 3rd Earl of Sunderland.

They are believed to have had two or more other children who died young, as Lady Sunderland referred in a letter to &quot;my two living of seven children&quot;.

<text>Cavinti, officially the Municipality of Cavinti (), is a municipality located in the Sierra Madre mountain range in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 Census, it has a population of 23,980 people. 

Major produce are its pandan products, including the sambalilo (straw hat). It is also known as the ecotourism, adventure, and glamping capital of the Philippines.

The official song of the Municipality of Cavinti and its people is the &quot;Cavinti Hymn&quot; or &quot;Imno ng Cavinti (Filipino)&quot;. The anthem was composed by Bonifacio J. Linay, a native of Cavinti.

== History ==
The municipality of Cavinti was originally a part of Lumban, Laguna. It was only in 1619 when the town gained complete and independent status as a parish by virtue of a papal bull believed to have come directly from Rome. In fact, this was why, again according to the legends, the two Puhawan brothers of Lumban, in search of food in early 1600, reached Cavinti where they found an image which turned out to be that of El Salvador. They brought the image to their home in Lumban. But in no time, it got lost only to be found again the very same place where it was first discovered. Today on that hallowed grounds stands majestically the centuries-old Catholic Church in honor of El Salvador built by the town&#x27;s forebears for all the generations to enjoy and cherish.

The church&#x27;s early structures were made of light materials. For many times they had to rebuild it on account of destruction wrought by natural calamities such as earthquakes, typhoons, and fires.

The ecclesiastical supervision of the church also belonged to Lumban since its founding. Even at the time of the construction of the first stone church in 1621.

=== Spanish period ===
During this era, Cavinti was one of the least villages of Lumban, Laguna. The population was very low and no significant development was recorded since during that time development was focused on the municipality of Lumban. The town of Cavinti served then as a hunting ground for hunters.

=== American period ===
In 1903, Cavinti was reduced as part of Luisiana by virtue of Act No. 939. It later separated from Luisiana to be reconstituted as an independent municipality by virtue of Act No. 1712 in 1907.

Cavinti became one of the municipalities with high insurgency due to the construction of hydropower dam where several lands were submerged. In the 1930s, Teodoro Asedillo and his group operated in Cavinti, holding meetings in schools to explain the aims of the Katipunan ng mga Anak-Pawis sa Pilipinas and recruit fighters to his cause. He garnered major support in Cavinti and nearby towns, who would shelter him, provide him with funds and other resources. Asedillo was killed on December 31, 1935 following a manhunt and intense surveillance against him and his supporters. His body was crucified and paraded around town to discourage supporters.

Two connected man-made lakes (Lake Lumot and Lake Caliraya) were built by American engineers in 1943 to supply water to the Caliraya Hydroelectric Plant. As the dams were constructed, entrepreneurs with foresight created two adjacent communities which were envisioned to be ecological communities, where one can enjoy the beauty and richness of unspoiled nature. The results were man-made mountain lakes complete with coves and sandbars - Lake Caliraya and Lake Lumot. The Americans also seeded the lake with Largemouth Black Bass imported from the US, which continues to proliferate and provide game fishers with year-round weekend excitement.

In fact, the two lakes are some of the places in the whole country where Philippine anglers can attempt to catch the famed Largemouth Black Bass, one of the top freshwater gamefish of the United States of America. During this regime, no further economic and infrastructure projects were implemented in the town of Cavinti.

=== Japanese Occupation ===
All over the country, the Japanese period was the days of disorder, fear, and desolation. Shortage of foods, limited infrastructure, limited medical services and limited educational services were rampant throughout the country. The Philippines was run by a ‘puppet’ government as it was being governed by the watchful eyes of the Japanese Imperial Army.

During this regime, insurgency became rampant, and no further economic and infrastructure development was implemented in the town of Cavinti.

=== The Third Republic ===
During this period, people in the municipality of Cavinti put their hope in the new form of government. However, due to the effects of war, there were extensive problems in infrastructure, specifically roads, bridges and the construction of schools, along with the problems of pestilence and starvation. Thus, there was no further development for the town of Cavinti until the 1960s, when ground was broken on the Lake Caliraya shoreline for the building of the resort communities, which began a period of economic rebirth. Today, the highland town of Northeastern Laguna continues to grow economically and as a tourism center for visitors coming from all over the country and overseas.

<doc id="292971" wikidata="Q3640801" url="?curid=292971" title="Blackmoor (campaign setting)">
<text>Blackmoor is a fantasy role-playing game campaign setting generally associated with the game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. It originated in the early 1970s as the personal setting of Dave Arneson, the co-creator of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, as an early testing ground for what would become &quot;D&amp;D&quot;.

==Early history==
Blackmoor began as a development of David Wesely&#x27;s &quot;Braunstein&quot; games following Duane Jenkins&#x27; Brownstone (Old West) variant and Arneson&#x27;s own wargaming sessions, into which he had begun to introduce fantasy elements. Initially inspired by Conan novels and gothic horror, Arneson expanded the setting around the eponymous town, castle, and multi-level dungeon using ideas borrowed from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; and made use of the Fantasy Supplement rules from the &quot;Chainmail&quot; game. Blackmoor was a campaign centered on individual player characters capable of continuing progressions, which encouraged cooperative play to succeed. D. H. Boggs suggested a possible influence of the film &quot;The Black Room&quot;, as inspiration for Blackmoor as it was aired twice before the first game, and it was mentioned by Dave Arneson as a film he was possibly watching while reading Conan.

The origins of the Blackmoor setting lie in the Castle &amp; Crusade Society, a subgroup of the International Federation of Wargaming specializing in medieval miniatures combat; the group was initially driven by Gary Gygax. Dave Arneson was among the first to join the Society in April 1970, and many other members of his Twin Cities gaming group followed, including Duane Jenkins, Bill Hoyt, Ed Werncke, Mike Carr, and Marshall Hoegfeldt. Within months, the leadership of the Society had decided to form a fictional &quot;Great Kingdom&quot;, with parcels of land awarded to and contested by members of the organization. Arneson assumed responsibility for the far northern reaches of the Great Kingdom, and it was there that he began to stage medieval games that led up to the Blackmoor setting. An announcement in Arneson&#x27;s fanzine &quot;Corner of the Table&quot; describes the first game in the campaign, one built on the model of Dave Wesely&#x27;s &quot;Braunstein&quot; series of games:

The next issue of &quot;Corner of the Table&quot; promised &quot;the start of the &#x27;Black Moors&#x27; battle reports, a series dealing with the perils of living in Medieval Europe&quot;. Initially, The Northern Marches was set up to be an ongoing multiplayer wargame, with the potential for Braunstein games. The Barony of Blackmoor formed the centerpiece of the game, and the various players attached to it (Greg Svenson, David Megarry, Dan Nicholson, Duane Jenkins), initially represented the forces of good. Duane Jenkins, for example, ruled the Northern Marches, first as a bandit chief, later promoted to Baron as Sir Jenkins. As the game progressed, more of Arneson&#x27;s Napoleonics players joined in increasingly diverse roles. Mike Carr, for example, became a village priest, and then Bishop of Blackmoor. Others chose early in the campaign to side with the forces of evil, such as a wizard played by John Soukup. Early descriptions of the activities of the Blackmoor campaign circulated in a news sheet called the &quot;Blackmoor Gazette and Rumormonger&quot;. Players became increasingly drawn to the innovative dungeon exploration mechanic that Arneson invented; by 1972, that had become a major focus of the game. As demand for Blackmoor increased, Arneson fielded out refereeing duties to other players in his local circle.

In the summer of 1972, Arneson famously wrote an article detailing &quot;Facts about Black Moor&quot; for &quot;Domesday Book&quot; #13, which brought his innovations to the attention of the rest of the Castle &amp; Crusade Society. That fall, Arneson demonstrated the game for Gygax, and work on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; commenced. As rule development proceeded, the Blackmoor campaign continued, and began coordinating with a parallel campaign known as Greyhawk run out of Lake Geneva by Gygax and his circle. After the publication of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, the Blackmoor campaign continued, but as a number of key participants (including Arneson) left Minneapolis to work in Lake Geneva, play of the campaign grew more sporadic.

==&quot;Supplement II: Blackmoor&quot;==

The original &quot;Blackmoor&quot; product was published by Tactical Studies Rules (TSR) in 1975, as the second supplement to &quot;D&amp;D&quot; (the first being &quot;Greyhawk&quot;). The booklet was named for the original role-playing campaign world by Dave Arneson, who also wrote this booklet. It added rules, monsters, treasure, and the first published role-playing game adventure, the &quot;Temple of the Frog&quot;, a scenario from the Loch Gloomen section of the Blackmoor campaign. Other than the &quot;Temple of the Frog&quot;, &quot;Blackmoor&quot; did not include any information on the Blackmoor setting itself.

==&quot;The First Fantasy Campaign&quot;==

Written by Dave Arneson and published by Judges Guild in 1977, &quot;The First Fantasy Campaign&quot; added information on the actual Blackmoor campaign setting. It included baronies, citadels, history of leaders and details on the Blackmoor dungeon. It also contained additional rules for creating lairs, character interests and vocations.

&quot;The First Fantasy Campaign&quot; anthologizes material produced at various stages of the Blackmoor campaign, from Magic Swords (1971) up to the Blackmoor dungeons Arneson commonly ran at conventions in 1976. Only a relatively small amount of original material, primarily link text, was written specifically for the &quot;First Fantasy Campaign&quot;, though all maps and some connected illustrations were redrawn and relettered by the Judges Guild&#x27;s Bob Bledsaw. Thus, the &quot;First Fantasy Campaign&quot; is a rich repository of pre-Dungeons &amp; Dragons material which preserves original rules and campaign events. For example, it contains the entirety of the &quot;Facts about Black Moor&quot; article from Domesday Book #13. It also contains circa-1972 price lists as well as rules dating from the exile of the Blackmoor Bunch to Loch Gloomen in the late Spring of 1972.

The 1977 first printing, including its cover, is in black and white. The cover says &quot;The First Fantasy Campaign Playing Aid&quot; with &quot;Playing Aid&quot; as a subtitle. It shows a large mostly circular picture with trees in the foreground and a fire elemental in the background, below which it says &quot;by Dave Arneson&quot; and &quot;Judges Guild&quot;. There is no other verbiage on the cover and the price does not appear on the cover. The back cover has a product list titled &quot;Booty List&quot; with the highest number being 35 and &quot;New Non-Sub Items&quot; listing product numbers 36–39. It comes with the first printing of the First Fantasy Campaign Maps. This book consists of 92 numbered pages plus the cover, inside cover, back cover and table of contents for a total of 96 total pages. The dark red cover was used for the reformatted later printings that used a smaller font and fewer pages.

==DA module series==

Arneson left TSR in the early 1980s, but Blackmoor remained a part of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; lore and was referred to in many later supplements. In a subsequent re-release of the world of Greyhawk for the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game, an arctic region of mysterious black ice in the northwestern area of the map was called Blackmoor. However, Arneson&#x27;s Blackmoor became integral to a different setting and rules system, those of the &quot;Basic Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game.

For various reasons, TSR published two different versions of their flagship game line. Over the course of several supplements, the &quot;Basic Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; developed its own campaign setting, referred to at first simply as the Known World and later as Mystara. When the history of Mystara was codified, it was established that Arneson&#x27;s Blackmoor had existed in the world&#x27;s distant past, achieved a technologically advanced civilization, and then destroyed itself in a global catastrophe that shifted the planet&#x27;s axis.

Its influence was now central to at least one of TSR&#x27;s published worlds, but the actual setting of Blackmoor as Arneson described it had yet to be presented. This was finally remedied in the mid-1980s through the DA series of adventure modules, which carried a party of adventurers into Mystara&#x27;s past to visit Blackmoor. The first of these, DA1 &quot;Adventures in Blackmoor&quot;, described in general the geography and politics of Blackmoor and the means by which the characters travel there. DA2 &quot;Temple of the Frog&quot; expanded the scenario that had appeared in the original Blackmoor supplement. DA3 &quot;City of the Gods&quot; explored the starship crashed near the Kingdom of Blackmoor, from which the setting&#x27;s intentional anachronisms derived. DA4 &quot;The Duchy of Ten&quot; dealt with a horde of invading barbarians, but was the only work not derived from Dave Arneson&#x27;s original campaign notes. A fifth installment, DA5 &quot;City of Blackmoor&quot;, was announced but was never written or published.

There were no further direct explorations of Blackmoor, although later Mystara products continued to make reference to it. For instance, &quot;The Wrath of the Immortals&quot;, an epic adventure which described a massive war involving both heaven and earth, climaxes with the discovery of the preserved control room from the starship that had crashed near Blackmoor millennia ago.

==Later editions==
After the &quot;Basic D&amp;D&quot; game and its Mystara setting were discontinued, Zeitgeist Games, where Arneson worked prior to his death, produced an updated d20 System version of Blackmoor titled &quot;Dave Arneson&#x27;s Blackmoor Campaign Setting&quot;, published by Goodman Games in 2004. Goodman and Zeitgeist also produced Blackmoor adventure modules. In 2009 Code Monkey Publishing released &quot;Dave Arneson&#x27;s Blackmoor: The First Campaign&quot;, an updated campaign guide for the 4th edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;.

==Blackmoor MMRPG==
There was also an ongoing massively multiplayer role playing game campaign organized by Zeitgeist games, which is similar in form to the Living Campaigns organized by the RPGA. The version of the campaign for D&amp;D 3.5 ended in February 2009 at Megacon.

<doc id="292972" wikidata="Q7711881" url="?curid=292972" title="The 3AM Girls">
<text>The 3AM Girls was the collective title of the gossip columnists for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, a British tabloid newspaper.

==Background==
The group rose to prominence during Piers Morgan&#x27;s time as editor of the paper and was created by Morgan with Richard Wallace in response to the &quot;ladette&quot; culture of the 1990s.

The column is now called 3am and was later edited by Clemmie Moodie with Ashleigh Rainbird. In 2009, the website 3am.co.uk appeared, edited by Dominic Mohan&#x27;s sister Isabel. Their tabloid counterparts are The Goss Girls for the &quot;Daily Star&quot; and Dan Wootton who edits &quot;The Sun&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Bizarre&quot; column.

In May 2016, the daily 3am column was published for the last time.

==Rivalry with Chris Moyles==
In September 2004, BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles highlighted the made-up news stories and quotes on his then-afternoon music and chat show. The following day Moyles&#x27;s mobile phone number was printed in the paper as a retaliation. Moyles called for the 3AM girls to resign, and several thousand of Moyles&#x27;s listeners rang in to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; to complain. The &quot;Mirror&quot; asked Moyles to call off his listeners, which he did, claiming he had won the battle by doing this.

==Fictitious quotations==
In 2007 &quot;Private Eye&quot; reported former 3AM girl Jessica Callan as saying that quotes for interviewees were made up by journalists: &quot;The conversations celebrities had with us often bore no relation to the words which were printed in the column. On the odd occasion I didn&#x27;t even know the quotes had been rewritten until I read the paper the following day... There was re-jigging and there was making up entire chats. Amazingly, we were never sued for having imaginary conversations&quot;.

<doc id="292983" wikidata="Q4949556" url="?curid=292983" title="Helen Garner">
<text>Helen Garner (née Ford, born 7 November 1942) is an Australian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter and journalist. Garner&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Monkey Grip&quot;, published in 1977, immediately established her as an original voice on the Australian literary scene—it is now widely considered a classic. She has a reputation for incorporating and adapting her personal experiences in her fiction, something that has brought her widespread attention, particularly with her novels &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; and &quot;The Spare Room&quot; (2008).

Throughout her career, Garner has written both fiction and non-fiction. She attracted controversy with her book &quot;The First Stone&quot; (1995) about a sexual-harassment scandal in a university college. She has also written for film and theatre, and has consistently won awards for her work, including the Walkley Award for a 1993 &quot;Time&quot; magazine report. Adaptations of two of her works have appeared as feature films: her debut novel, &quot;Monkey Grip&quot;, and her true-crime book &quot;Joe Cinque&#x27;s Consolation&quot; (2004)—the former released in 1982 and the latter in 2016.

Garner&#x27;s works have covered a broad range of themes and subject matter. She has written three true-crime books: &quot;The First Stone&quot;, about the aftermath of a sexual-harassment scandal at a university, &quot;Joe Cinque&#x27;s Consolation&quot;, a journalistic novel about the court proceedings involving a young man who died at the hands of his girlfriend, which won the Ned Kelly Award for Best Crime Book, and, in 2014, &quot;This House of Grief&quot;, about Robert Farquharson, a man who drove his children into a dam. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) site has characterised her as one of Australia&#x27;s &quot;most important and admired writers&quot;, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; referred to her as &quot;Australia&#x27;s greatest living writer&quot;.

== Early life ==

Garner was born Helen Ford to Bruce and Gwen Ford (née Gadsden) in Geelong, Victoria, the eldest of six children. Her sister Catherine Ford is also a writer of fiction. Garner described her upbringing as being in an &quot;ordinary Australian home—not many books and not much talk&quot;.

Garner attended Manifold Heights State School, Ocean Grove State School and then The Hermitage in Geelong, where she was the head prefect and dux. She left Geelong after her high school graduation at the age of 18 to study at the University of Melbourne, residing at Janet Clarke Hall, and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree with majors in English and French. One of her teachers at the University of Melbourne was the poet Vincent Buckley.
Between 1966 and 1972, Garner worked as a teacher at various Victorian high schools. In 1967, she also travelled overseas and met Bill Garner, whom she married in 1968 on their return to Australia, aged 25. Her only child, the actor, musician and writer Alice Garner, was born in 1969. Garner&#x27;s first marriage ended in 1971.

In 1972, Garner was sacked by the Victorian Department of Education for &quot;giving an unscheduled sex education lesson to her 13-year-old students at Fitzroy High School&quot;. She had written an essay about the lesson and published it under a pen name in &quot;The Digger&quot;, a countercultural Melbourne-based magazine. Garner wrote that she had intended to give a lesson on Ancient Greece, but the textbooks given to her students had been defaced with sexually explicit drawings. As a result of those drawings, the class had posed questions to Garner relating to sex, and she decided to allow an uninhibited discussion based around their questions which, as their teacher, she vowed to answer accurately.

When her identity was revealed, she was called into the Victorian Department of Education and dismissed. The case was widely publicised in Melbourne, bringing Garner a degree of notoriety. Members of the Victorian Secondary Teachers Association went on strike in protest at the deputy director of Secondary Education&#x27;s decision to fire Garner. Aside from her writing for &quot;The Digger&quot;, she also wrote articles for the Melbourne feminist newspaper &quot;Vashti&#x27;s Voice&quot;. Garner appeared in the 1975 independent film &quot;Pure Shit&quot;, which focuses on four drug addicts searching for heroin in Melbourne.

==Career==
===Early career and fiction writing===
Garner came to prominence at a time when Australian writers were relatively few in number, and Australian women writers were, by some, considered a novelty. Australian academic and writer, Kerryn Goldsworthy, writes that &quot;From the beginning of her writing career Garner was regarded as, and frequently called, a stylist, a realist, and a feminist&quot;.

Her first novel, &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; (1977), relates the lives of a group of fledgeling artists, single parents, drug addicts and welfare recipients living in Melbourne share-houses. In particular focus is the increasingly co-dependent relationship between single mother Nora and Javo, a flaky junkie whom Nora is in love with, despite him repeatedly drifting in and out of her life. The novel, set in inner-city Melbourne suburbs Fitzroy and Carlton, was written in the domed reading room at the State Library of Victoria, after Garner&#x27;s teaching dismissal. Years later she stated that she had adapted it directly from her personal diaries and based the relationship between Nora and Javo on a relationship she had with a man at the time. Other peripheral characters in the book were based on people in Garner&#x27;s own social circle from Melbourne share-houses. &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; was very successful: it won the National Book Council Award in 1978 and was adapted into a film in 1982.

Goldsworthy suggests that the success of &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; may well have helped revive the careers of two older but largely ignored Australian women writers, Jessica Anderson and Thea Astley. Astley wrote of the novel that &quot;I am filled with envy by someone like Helen Garner for instance. I re-read &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; a while ago and it&#x27;s even better second time through&quot;. Critics have retrospectively applied the term grunge lit to describe &quot;Monkey Grip&quot;, citing its depiction of urban life and social realism as key aspects of later works in the subgenre.

In subsequent books, she has continued to adapt her personal experiences. Her later novels are &quot;The Children&#x27;s Bach&quot; (1984) and &quot;Cosmo Cosmolino&quot; (1992). In 2008 she returned to fiction writing with the publication of &quot;The Spare Room&quot;, a fictional treatment of caring for a dying cancer patient, based on the illness and death of Garner&#x27;s friend Jenya Osborne. She has also published several short-story collections: &quot;Honour &amp; Other People&#x27;s Children: Two Stories&quot; (1980), &quot;Postcards from Surfers&quot; (1985) and &quot;My Hard Heart: Selected Fictions&quot; (1998).

In 1986, Australian academic and critic Don Anderson wrote of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Bach&quot;: &quot;There are four perfect short novels in the English language. They are, in chronological order, Ford Madox Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Good Soldier&quot;, Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and Garner&#x27;s &quot;The Children&#x27;s Bach&quot;.&quot; The Australian composer Andrew Schultz wrote an opera of the same name, which premiered in 2008.

Garner said, in 1985, that writing novels was like &quot;trying to make a patchwork quilt look seamless. A novel is made up of scraps of our own lives and bits of other people&#x27;s, and things we think of in the middle of the night and whole notebooks full of randomly collected details&quot;. In an interview in 1999, she said that &quot;My initial reason for writing is that I need to shape things so I can make them bearable or comprehensible to myself. It&#x27;s my way of making sense of things that I&#x27;ve lived and seen other people live, things that I&#x27;m afraid of, or that I long for&quot;.

Not all critics have liked Garner&#x27;s work. Goldsworthy writes, &quot;It is certainly the case that Garner is someone whose work elicits strong feelings ... and people who dislike her work are profoundly irritated by those who think she is one of the best writers in the country&quot;. Novelist and reviewer Peter Corris wrote in his review of &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; that Garner &quot;has published her private journal rather than written a novel&quot;, while Peter Pierce wrote in &quot;Meanjin&quot; of &quot;Honour &amp; Other People&#x27;s Children&quot; that Garner &quot;talks dirty and passes it off as realism&quot;. Goldsworthy suggests that these two statements imply that she is not really a writer. Craven, though, argues that her novella &quot;The Children&#x27;s Bach&quot; &quot;should put paid to the myth of Helen Garner as a mere literalist or reporter&quot;, arguing, in fact, that it &quot;is light-years away from any sprawling-tell-it-all naturalism, [that] it is concentrated realism of extraordinary formal polish and the amount of tonal variation which it gets from its seemingly simple plot is multifoliate to the point of being awesome&quot;.

===Screen writing===
She has written three screenplays: &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; (1982), written with and directed by Ken Cameron; &quot;Two Friends&quot; (1986), directed by Jane Campion for TV; and &quot;The Last Days of Chez Nous&quot; (1992), directed by Gillian Armstrong. The relationship between two characters in &quot;The Last Days of Chez Nous&quot; was loosely inspired by the extramarital affair Garner&#x27;s second husband had with her sister.

Critic Peter Craven writes that &quot;&quot;Two Friends&quot; is arguably the most accomplished piece of screenwriting the country has seen and it is characterised by a total lack of condescension towards the teenage girls at its centre&quot;.

===Non-fiction writing===
Garner has written non-fiction from the beginning of her career as a writer. In 1972 she was fired from her teaching job after publishing in &quot;The Digger&quot;, a counter-culture magazine, an anonymous account of frank and extended discussions she had with her students about sexuality and sexual activities. She wrote for this magazine from 1972 to 1974. In 1993, she won a Walkley Award for her &quot;Time&quot; magazine account of a murder trial following the death of a toddler at the hands of his stepfather.

One of her most famous and controversial books is &quot;The First Stone&quot; (1995), an account of a 1992 sexual harassment scandal at Ormond College. It was a best-seller in Australia but also attracted considerable criticism. Garner had received hate-mail from women in Australia who accused her of derailing the feminist debate, and closing ranks with the abuser. She has since commented: &quot;Sometimes I would have these kind of panic attacks caused by the hostility that some people showed towards me. I guess I knew there was going to be trouble, but the vitriolic nature of it gave me a bit of a shock&quot;.

Garner&#x27;s other non-fiction books are &quot;True Stories: Selected Non-Fiction&quot; (1996), &quot;The Feel of Steel&quot; (2001), &quot;Joe Cinque&#x27;s Consolation&quot; (2004) and &quot;This House of Grief – The Story of a Murder Trial&quot; (2014). She also contributed to &quot;La Mama, the Story of a Theatre&quot; (1988). &quot;Joe Cinque&#x27;s Consolation&quot; details a notorious murder case in Canberra involving a law student, Anu Singh, who drugged and murdered her boyfriend. It was adapted into a feature film in 2016. The film had premiers at both the Melbourne Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival, where it was generally well received, although detractors felt that the absence of Garner&#x27;s voice from the story impacted the film—James Robert Douglas, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stated the film adaptation contained the &quot;bones but not the wisdom of Garner&#x27;s book&quot;.

===Themes===
Garner has covered a broad range of themes in her work, including feminism, love, loss, grief, ageing, illness, death, murder, betrayal, addiction and the duality of the human psyche, particularly in manifestations of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;. Her earliest work, &quot;Monkey Grip&quot;, is well known for its untamed depiction of heroin addiction. Its central character, a single mother, falls in love with an addict in an inner-city bohemian Melbourne suburb, dotted with junkies and share houses, during the 1970s. Drug addiction, however, was not a subject Garner would revisit, aside from touching on recreational drug use among university students in &quot;Joe Cinque&#x27;s Consolation&quot;. However, &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; did establish Garner&#x27;s trademark theme of obsession, particularly in conjunction with love and sexuality—enmeshed with substance abuse mirroring the addiction of romantic love.

Some of her novels address &quot;sexual desire and the family&quot;, exploring &quot;the relationship between sexual behaviour and social organisation; the anarchic nature of desire and the orderly force of the institution of &#x27;family&#x27;; the similarities and differences between collective households and nuclear families; the significance and the language of housework; [and] the idea of &#x27;the house&#x27; as image, symbol, site and peace.&quot; Garner has become known for her depiction of Australian life, both in the city and rural regions—she was born in Geelong and spent much of her life in Melbourne, approximately from her hometown. Anne Myers, in an article written for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, recognised Garner&#x27;s portrayals of the location of Melbourne as essential to &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; itself as any character: &quot;Garner was writing Melbourne into the literary landscape and for the first time I saw my own world reflected back at me&quot;.

&quot;Joe Cinque&#x27;s Consolation&quot;, &quot;This House of Grief&quot; and, to a lesser extent, &quot;The First Stone&quot; were commentaries on the justice system in Australia, how (and if) it adequately responds to crime, and the question of culpability.

Craven comments that Garner is &quot;always an extremely &quot;accurate&quot; writer in terms of the emotional states she depicts&quot;. Many of her books touch upon the inexplicable, irrational, and dark side to human behaviour—as well as Garner&#x27;s attempts to understand human behaviour and sociology, which often eludes the average Australian and wider society, as well as the Australian justice system. In &quot;The Fate of The First Stone&quot;, Garner writes that she believes most people would prefer to keep incomprehensible stories of extreme behaviour at &quot;arm&#x27;s length&quot; because it is &quot;more comfortable, easier&quot;. Peter Craven wrote that Garner is fearless in her honesty: &quot;she shows us what she does not know or is too blind to see: she shows us the poverty of the self in the face of impercipience caused by sentiment or anger, prejudice, ignorance or dumb incapacity.&quot; He further commented on her ability to sometimes identify with the story&#x27;s perceived villain, &quot;[the] transgressor who at some level shares our own fingerprints&quot;. Similarly, various critics and journalists have highlighted Garner&#x27;s portrayal of &quot;ordinary people&quot; caught up in extraordinary experiences, or the everyday person who, &quot;under life&#x27;s unbearable pressures&quot;, has &quot;surrendered to their darker selves&quot;. James Wood, in a profile on Garner published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, stated that her work is absorbed in issues of gender and class, which he writes are &quot;not categories so much as structures of feeling, variously argued over, enjoyed, endured, and escaped&quot;.

As part of her depiction of Australian life, Garner&#x27;s work often included an exploration of masculinity and its codes, an exploration that found a focussed expression in &quot;The Season&quot;, which observed adolescent boys transitioning into adulthood within the framework of Australian Rules Football.

==Personal life==
After her marriage to Bill Garner ended, Garner married two more times: to Jean-Jacques Portail (1980–85) and Australian writer Murray Bail (born 1941), from whom she separated in the late 1990s. She is no longer married. In her work, she has been open about her struggle with depression and her two abortions.

She has one child, Alice Garner (b. 1969), from her marriage to Bill Garner. Alice Garner is also an author, as well as a musician, teacher and historian.

In 2003, a portrait of Garner, titled &quot;True Stories&quot;, painted by Jenny Sages, was a finalist in the Archibald Prize.

==Critical studies and reviews==
* Review of &quot;This House of Grief&quot;.

In October 2023, John Powers, NPR&#x27;s pop culture critic, described the Garner as &quot;This Australian writer might be the greatest novelist you&#x27;ve never heard of&quot;, noting in particular &quot;The Children&#x27;s Bach&quot;, and &quot;This House of Grief&quot;. He summarises: &quot;Near the end of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Bach&quot;, the womanizing musician tells Athena how to write a song. &quot;You have to steer a line,&quot; he says, &quot;between what you understand and what you don&#x27;t.&quot; He could well be describing what makes Garner&#x27;s work so compelling. Reading her, I&#x27;m always inspired that a writer who already knows so much of life never stops pushing herself into unknown territory.&quot;

<text>A lahar (, from ) is a violent type of mudflow or debris flow composed of a slurry of pyroclastic material, rocky debris and water. The material flows down from a volcano, typically along a river valley.

Lahars are often extremely destructive and deadly; they can flow tens of metres per second, they have been known to be up to deep, and large flows tend to destroy any structures in their path. Notable lahars include those at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines and Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, the latter of which killed more than 20,000 people in the Armero tragedy.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;lahar&quot; is of Javanese origin. Berend George Escher introduced it as a geological term in 1922.

==Description==

The word &quot;lahar&quot; is a general term for a flowing mixture of water and pyroclastic debris. It does not refer to a particular rheology or sediment concentration. Lahars can occur as normal stream flows (sediment concentration of less than 30%), hyper-concentrated stream flows (sediment concentration between 30 and 60%), or debris flows (sediment concentration exceeding 60%). Indeed, the rheology and subsequent behaviour of a lahar may vary in place and time within a single event, owing to changes in sediment supply and water supply. Lahars are described as &#x27;primary&#x27; or &#x27;syn-eruptive&#x27; if they occur simultaneously with or are triggered by primary volcanic activity. &#x27;Secondary&#x27; or &#x27;post-eruptive&#x27; lahars occur in the absence of primary volcanic activity, e.g. as a result of rainfall during pauses in activity or during dormancy.

In addition to their variable rheology, lahars vary considerably in magnitude. The Osceola Lahar produced by Mount Rainier in modern-day Washington some 5600 years ago resulted in a wall of mud deep in the White River canyon and covered an area of over , for a total volume of . A debris-flow lahar can erase virtually any structure in its path, while a hyperconcentrated-flow lahar is capable of carving its own pathway, destroying buildings by undermining their foundations. A hyperconcentrated-flow lahar can leave even frail huts standing, while at the same time burying them in mud, which can harden to near-concrete hardness. A lahar&#x27;s viscosity decreases the longer it flows and can be further thinned by rain, producing a quicksand-like mixture that can remain fluidized for weeks and complicate search and rescue.

Lahars vary in speed. Small lahars less than a few metres wide and several centimetres deep may flow a few metres per second. Large lahars hundreds of metres wide and tens of metres deep can flow several tens of metres per second (22 mph or more), much too fast for people to outrun. On steep slopes, lahar speeds can exceed . A lahar can cause catastrophic destruction along a potential path of more than .

Lahars from the 1985 Nevado del Ruiz eruption in Colombia caused the Armero tragedy, burying the city of Armero under of mud and debris and killing an estimated 23,000 people. A lahar caused New Zealand&#x27;s Tangiwai disaster, where 151 people died after a Christmas Eve express train fell into the Whangaehu River in 1953. Lahars have caused 17% of volcano-related deaths between 1783 and 1997.

==Trigger mechanisms==

Lahars have several possible causes:
* Snow and glaciers can be melted by lava or pyroclastic surges during an eruption.
* Lava can erupt from open vents and mix with wet soil, mud or snow on the slope of the volcano making a very viscous, high energy lahar. The higher up the slope of the volcano, the more gravitational potential energy the flows will have.
* A flood caused by a glacier, lake breakout, or heavy rainfalls can generate lahars, also called glacier run or jökulhlaup.
* Water from a crater lake can combine with volcanic material in an eruption.
* Heavy rainfall can mobilize unconsolidated pyroclastic deposits.
In particular, although lahars are typically associated with the effects of volcanic activity, lahars can occur even without any current volcanic activity, as long as the conditions are right to cause the collapse and movement of mud originating from existing volcanic ash deposits.
* Snow and glaciers can melt during periods of mild to hot weather.
* Earthquakes underneath or close to the volcano can shake material loose and cause it to collapse, triggering a lahar avalanche.
* Rainfall can cause the still-hanging slabs of solidified mud to come rushing down the slopes at a speed of more than , causing devastating results.

==Places at risk==
Several mountains in the world – including Mount Rainier in the United States, Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand, and Merapi and Galunggung in Indonesia – are considered particularly dangerous due to the risk of lahars. Several towns in the Puyallup River valley in Washington state, including Orting, are built on top of lahar deposits that are only about 500 years old. Lahars are predicted to flow through the valley every 500 to 1,000 years, so Orting, Sumner, Puyallup, Fife, and the Port of Tacoma face considerable risk. The USGS has set up lahar warning sirens in Pierce County, Washington, so that people can flee an approaching debris flow in the event of a Mount Rainier eruption.

A lahar warning system has been set up at Mount Ruapehu by the New Zealand Department of Conservation and hailed as a success after it successfully alerted officials to an impending lahar on 18 March 2007.

Since mid-June 1991, when violent eruptions triggered Mount Pinatubo&#x27;s first lahars in 500 years, a system to monitor and warn of lahars has been in operation. Radio-telemetered rain gauges provide data on rainfall in lahar source regions, acoustic flow monitors on stream banks detect ground vibration as lahars pass, and staffed watchpoints further confirm that lahars are rushing down Pinatubo&#x27;s slopes. This system has enabled warnings to be sounded for most but not all major lahars at Pinatubo, saving hundreds of lives. Physical preventative measures by the Philippine government were not adequate to stop over of mud from flooding many villages around Mount Pinatubo from 1992 through 1998.

Scientists and governments try to identify areas with a high risk of lahars based on historical events and computer models. Volcano scientists play a critical role in effective hazard education by informing officials and the public about realistic hazard probabilities and scenarios (including potential magnitude, timing, and impacts); by helping evaluate the effectiveness of proposed risk-reduction strategies; by helping promote acceptance of (and confidence in) hazards information through participatory engagement with officials and vulnerable communities as partners in risk reduction efforts; and by communicating with emergency managers during extreme events. An example of such a model is TITAN2D. These models are directed towards future planning: identifying low-risk regions to place community buildings, discovering how to mitigate lahars with dams, and constructing evacuation plans.

==Examples==

===Nevado del Ruiz===

In 1985, the volcano Nevado del Ruiz erupted in central Colombia. As pyroclastic flows erupted from the volcano&#x27;s crater, they melted the mountain&#x27;s glaciers, sending four enormous lahars down its slopes at . The lahars picked up speed in gullies and coursed into the six major rivers at the base of the volcano; they engulfed the town of Armero, killing more than 20,000 of its almost 29,000 inhabitants.

Casualties in other towns, particularly Chinchiná, brought the overall death toll to over 25,000. Footage and photographs of Omayra Sánchez, a young victim of the tragedy, were published around the world. Other photographs of the lahars and the impact of the disaster captured attention worldwide and led to controversy over the degree to which the Colombian government was responsible for the disaster.

===Mount Pinatubo===

Lahars caused most of the deaths of the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The initial eruption killed six people, but the lahars killed more than 1500. The eye of Typhoon Yunya passed over the volcano during its eruption on 15 June 1991, and the resulting rain triggered the flow of volcanic ash, boulders, and water down rivers surrounding the volcano. Angeles City in Pampanga and neighbouring cities and towns were damaged by lahars when Sapang Balen Creek and the Abacan River became channels for mudflows and carried them to the heart of the city and surrounding areas.

Over of mud inundated and damaged the towns of Castillejos, San Marcelino and Botolan in Zambales, Porac and Mabalacat in Pampanga, Tarlac City, Capas, Concepcion and Bamban in Tarlac. The Bamban Bridge on the MacArthur Highway, a major north–south transportation route, was destroyed, and temporary bridges erected in its place were inundated by subsequent lahars.

On the morning of 1 October 1995, pyroclastic material which clung to the slopes of Pinatubo and surrounding mountains rushed down because of heavy rain, and turned into an lahar. This mudflow killed at least 100 people in Barangay Cabalantian in Bacolor. The Philippine government under President Fidel V. Ramos ordered the construction of the FVR Mega Dike in an attempt to protect people from further mudflows.

Typhoon Reming triggered additional lahars in the Philippines in 2006.

<text>Alastair Ian Stewart (born 5 September 1945) is a Scottish-born singer-songwriter and folk-rock musician who rose to prominence as part of the British folk revival in the 1960s and 1970s. He developed a unique style of combining folk-rock songs with tales of characters and events from history.

Stewart has released 16 studio and four live albums since his debut album &quot;Bed-Sitter Images&quot; in 1967, and continues to tour extensively in the US, Canada, Europe, and the UK. He is best known for his 1976 hit single &quot;Year of the Cat&quot;, from the platinum album of the same name. Though &quot;Year of the Cat&quot; and its 1978 platinum follow-up &quot;Time Passages&quot; brought Stewart his biggest worldwide commercial successes, earlier albums such as &quot;Past, Present and Future&quot; from 1973 are often seen as better examples of his intimate brand of historical folk-rock, a style to which he returned in later albums. His 2009 release, &quot;Uncorked&quot;, was released on his independent label, Wallaby Trails Recordings, and was followed up by &quot;Al Stewart and The Empty Pockets Live&quot; in 2024. Stewart has worked with Peter White, Alan Parsons, Jimmy Page, Richard Thompson, Rick Wakeman, Francis Monkman, Tori Amos, and Tim Renwick, and more recently has played with Dave Nachmanoff and former Wings lead-guitarist Laurence Juber.

Stewart appears throughout the musical history of the folk revivalist era. He played at the initial Glastonbury Festival in 1970, knew Yoko Ono before she met John Lennon, shared a London flat with Paul Simon (who was collaborating with Bruce Woodley of the Seekers), and hosted at the Les Cousins folk club in London in the 1960s.

==Early life==
Although born in Greenock, Al Stewart grew up in the town of Wimborne, Dorset, England, after moving from Scotland with his mother, Joan Underwood. His father, Alastair MacKichan Stewart, who served as a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, died in a plane crash during a 1945 training exercise before his son Al was born. Stewart attended Wycliffe College, Gloucestershire as a boarder. After that, according to the song &quot;Post World War II Blues&quot; (from &quot;Past, Present and Future&quot;): &quot;I came up to London when I was 19 with a corduroy jacket and a head full of dreams.&quot;

Having bought his fourth guitar from future Police guitarist Andy Summers, Stewart traded in his electric guitar for an acoustic guitar when he was offered a weekly slot at Bunjies Coffee House in London&#x27;s Soho in 1965. From there, he went on to serve as master of ceremonies at the Les Cousins folk club on Greek Street, where he played alongside Cat Stevens, Bert Jansch, Van Morrison, Roy Harper, Ralph McTell, and Paul Simon with whom he shared a flat in Dellow Street, Stepney, London.

==Career==

Stewart&#x27;s first recording was on Jackson C. Frank&#x27;s debut album, 1965&#x27;s &quot;Jackson C. Frank&quot;, playing guitar on &quot;Yellow Walls&quot;. His first record was the single &quot;The Elf&quot; (backed with a version of the Yardbirds&#x27; &quot;Turn into Earth&quot;), which was released in 1966 on Decca Records and included guitar work from Jimmy Page (later of the Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin). Stewart then signed to Columbia Records (CBS in the UK), for whom he released six albums. Though the first four of these attracted relatively little commercial interest, Stewart&#x27;s popularity and cult following grew steadily through albums that contain some of Stewart&#x27;s most incisive and introspective songwriting.

===Early albums (1967–1973)===
Stewart&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Bedsitter Images&quot;, was released in 1967. A revised version appeared in 1970 as &quot;The First Album (Bedsitter Images)&quot; with a few tracks changed, and the album was reissued on CD in 2007 with all tracks from both versions.

&quot;Love Chronicles&quot; (1969) was notable for the 18-minute title track, an anguished autobiographical tale of sexual encounters that was the first mainstream record release ever to include the word &quot;fucking&quot;. It was voted &quot;Folk Album of the Year&quot; by the UK music magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and features Jimmy Page and Richard Thompson on guitar.

His third album, &quot;Zero She Flies&quot;, followed in 1970 and included a number of shorter songs which ranged from acoustic ballads and instrumentals to songs that featured electric lead guitar. These first three albums (including &quot;The Elf&quot;) were later released as the two-CD set &quot;To Whom it May Concern: 1966–70&quot;.

In 1970, Stewart and fellow musician Ian A. Anderson headed to the small town of Pilton, Somerset. There, at Michael Eavis&#x27;s Worthy Farm, Stewart performed at the first-ever Glastonbury Festival to a field of 1,000 hippies, who had paid just £1 each to be there.

On the back of his growing success, Stewart released &quot;Orange&quot; in 1972. It was written after a tumultuous breakup with his girlfriend and muse, Mandi, and was very much a transitional album, combining songs in Stewart&#x27;s confessional style with more intimations of the historical themes that he would increasingly adopt (e.g., &quot;The News from Spain&quot; with its progressive rock overtones, including dramatic piano by Rick Wakeman).

The fifth release, &quot;Past, Present and Future&quot; (1973), was Stewart&#x27;s first album to receive a proper release in the United States, via Janus Records. It echoed a traditional historical storytelling style and contained the song &quot;Nostradamus,&quot; a long (9:43) track in which Stewart tied into the rediscovery of the claimed seer&#x27;s writings by referring to selected possible predictions about 20th century people and events. While it ran too long for mainstream radio airplay at that time, the song became a hit on many US FM and college radio stations, which were flexible about runtime.

Such airplay helped the album to reach No. 133 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart in the US. Other songs on &quot;Past, Present and Future&quot; characterized by Stewart&#x27;s &quot;history genre&quot; mentioned American President Warren G. Harding, World War II, Ernst Röhm, Christine Keeler, Louis Mountbatten, and Joseph Stalin&#x27;s purges.

===Alan Parsons years (1975–1978)===
Stewart followed &quot;Past, Present and Future&quot; with &quot;Modern Times&quot; (1975), in which the songs were lighter on historical references and more of a return to the theme of short stories set to music. Significantly, though, it was the first of his albums to be produced by Alan Parsons.

In a highly positive retrospective review of &quot;Modern Times&quot;, AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the album as &quot;exquisite&quot;. Erlewine wrote that the album &quot;establishes Stewart&#x27;s classic sound of folky narratives and Lennonesque melodies, all wrapped up in a lush, layered production from Alan Parsons. The production gives epics like the title track a real sense of grandeur that makes their sentiments resonate strongly.&quot;

&quot;Modern Times&quot; produced Stewart&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;Carol&quot;. The album reached No. 30 in the US and received substantial airplay on album-oriented stations some 30 years before Bob Dylan would release an album of the same name.

Stewart&#x27;s contract with CBS Records expired at this point, and he signed to RCA Records for the world outside North America. His first two albums for RCA, &quot;Year of the Cat&quot; (released on Janus Records in the US, then reissued by Arista Records after Janus folded) and &quot;Time Passages&quot; (released in the U.S. on Arista), set the style for his later work and have been his biggest-selling recordings.

Stewart told Kaya Burgess of &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;When I finished &quot;Year of the Cat&quot;, I thought: &#x27;If this isn&#x27;t a hit, then I can&#x27;t make a hit.&#x27; We finally got the formula exactly right.&quot;

Stewart had all of the music and orchestration written and completely recorded before he had a title for any of the songs. He mentioned in a Canadian radio interview that he has done this for six of his albums, and he often writes four different sets of lyrics for each song.

Both albums reached the top ten in the US, with &quot;Year of the Cat&quot; peaking at No. 5 and &quot;Time Passages&quot; at No. 10, and both albums produced hit singles in the US (&quot;Year of the Cat&quot; No. 8, and &quot;On the Border&quot;, #42; &quot;Time Passages&quot; No. 7 and &quot;Song on the Radio&quot;, #29). Meanwhile, &quot;Year of the Cat&quot; became Stewart&#x27;s first chart single in Britain, where it peaked at No. 31. It was a huge success at London&#x27;s Capital Radio, reaching number 2 on their Capital Countdown chart. The overwhelming success of these songs on the two albums, both of which still receive substantial radio airplay on classic-rock/pop format radio stations, has perhaps later overshadowed the depth and range of Stewart&#x27;s body of songwriting.

===1980s===
Stewart then released &quot;24 Carrots&quot; (#37 US 1980) and his first live album &quot;Live/Indian Summer&quot; (#110 US 1981), with both featuring backing by Peter White&#x27;s band Shot in the Dark (who released their own album in 1981). While &quot;24 Carrots&quot; did produce a No. 24 single with &quot;Midnight Rocks&quot;, the album sold less well than its two immediate predecessors.

After those releases, Stewart was dropped by Arista and his popularity declined. Despite his lower profile and waning commercial success, he continued to tour the world, record albums, and maintain a loyal fanbase. There was a four-year gap between his next two albums, the highly political &quot;Russians and Americans&quot; (1984) and the upbeat pop-oriented &quot;Last Days of the Century&quot; (1988), which appeared on smaller labels and had lower sales than his previous works.

===1990s===
Stewart followed up with his second live album, the acoustic &quot;Rhymes in Rooms&quot; (1992), which featured only Stewart and Peter White, and &quot;Famous Last Words&quot; (1993), which was dedicated to the memory of the late Peter Wood (co-writer of &quot;Year of the Cat&quot;), who died the year of its release.

After parting ways with his longtime collaborator of almost 20 years, Peter White (who was credited on every studio and live album between &quot;Year of the Cat&quot; and &quot;Famous Last Words&quot; and also served as his regular songwriting partner), Stewart joined with former Wings guitarist Laurence Juber to record a concept album, &quot;Between the Wars&quot; (1995), covering major historical and cultural events from 1918 to 1939, such as the Treaty of Versailles, Prohibition, the Spanish Civil War, and the Great Depression. Juber produced the album, and went on to produce Stewart&#x27;s subsequent studio albums.

In 1995, Stewart was invited to play at the 25th anniversary Glastonbury Festival.

===21st century===
In 2000, Stewart released &quot;Down in the Cellar&quot;, a concept album themed on wine. Stewart had begun a love affair with wine in the 1970s when, he admitted, he had more money than he knew how to spend, and so turned to fine wines.

In 2005, he released &quot;A Beach Full of Shells&quot;, which was set in places varying from First World War England to the 1950s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll scene that influenced him.

In 2008, he released &quot;Sparks of Ancient Light&quot;, produced, like his most recent albums, by Laurence Juber. On this album he weaves tales of William McKinley, Lord Salisbury, and Hanno the Navigator. A video for the song &quot;Elvis at the Wheel&quot; was released in December 2013.

Stewart and guitarist Dave Nachmanoff released a live album, &quot;Uncorked&quot;, on Stewart&#x27;s label, Wallaby Trails Recordings, in 2009. They played the Glastonbury Festival 40th anniversary in June 2010 on the acoustic stage.

Stewart sang a duet with Albert Hammond of Hammond&#x27;s &quot;It Never Rains in Southern California&quot; on Hammond&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Legend&quot;.

In 2011, Stewart sang a duet with his guitarist and opening act Dave Nachmanoff on Nachmanoff&#x27;s album &quot;Step Up&quot;. The song, &quot;Sheila Won&#x27;t Be Coming Home&quot;, was co-written by Stewart and Nachmanoff.

In May 2015, Stewart performed the albums &quot;Past, Present and Future&quot; and &quot;Year of the Cat&quot; in their entirety at the Royal Albert Hall with a band that included Tim Renwick, Peter White and Stuart Elliott, who had appeared on the original recordings.

In April 2017, Stewart was given a Lifetime Achievement award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, presented by Tony Blackburn, with whom he had once played in a band in Dorset.

In October 2022 he toured in the UK supported by the Empty Pockets (who opened with their own set before backing Stewart).

In 2024 Al Stewart released a live album along with the Empty Pockets (&quot;Al Stewart &amp; the Empty Pockets Live&quot;), with one track having as special guest Peter White.

Also in 2024 Al announced online a Farewell Tour in the UK with the Empty Pockets in 2025 to coincide with his 80th birthday.

==Personal life==
Born in Scotland, raised in Dorset, and gaining fame in London, Stewart moved to Los Angeles shortly after the release of &quot;Year of the Cat&quot;. He was married to Kristine, with whom he had two daughters, from 1993 to 2005. He subsequently married Jill on 12 September 2020.

===Literary sources===
&quot;Sirens of Titan&quot;, from &quot;Modern Times&quot; is a musical precis of Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s novel of the same name.

On occasion, Stewart has set poems to music, such as &quot;My Enemies Have Sweet Voices&quot; (lyrics by the poet Pete Morgan) on the 1970 album &quot;Zero She Flies&quot;. During his 1999 UK tour, Stewart invited Morgan to read the lyrics as he performed this song in the Leeds City Varieties Theatre show of 7 November 1999. Stewart also invited Morgan to read the poem at the Beverly gig on the same tour, whilst Stewart took a short break, and Morgan subsequently read another poem from his works as well.

==Songwriting==
In a 23 June 2012 telephone interview with Bob Reid and Blair Packham on NewsTalk 1010 AM in Toronto, Ontario (partially transcribed below), Al Stewart provided these insights into his songwriting &quot;process&quot;:

I don&#x27;t like repetition. For example, there have been nine songs in the Top Ten, I think, called &quot;Hold On&quot; (Including, I think, once there were two called &quot;Hold On&quot; simultaneously in the Top Ten). OK, if you&#x27;re really cynical, and you&#x27;ve written a new song, you&#x27;ll probably want to call it &quot;Hold On&quot; because it gives you an extra edge. But at the same time it shows so little interest in originality that I can&#x27;t actually listen to anything called &quot;Hold On&quot; at this point in my life. I mean, it just seems crazy. So, if I have two little rules and guiding principles, they would be:

(a) Don&#x27;t use words that other people use. Very few people would put the word, oh, I don&#x27;t know, &quot;pterodactyl&quot; into a song. So that&#x27;s fine. No &quot;Oh&quot;&#x27;s. No &quot;Baby&quot;&#x27;s. No &quot;I miss you so&quot;&#x27;s. And no &quot;you done me wrong&quot;. No &quot;bad&quot;&#x27;s or &quot;sad&quot;&#x27;s.

(b) And the other thing is, write about subjects that no one else writes about. Basically 90% of all songs seem to be either &quot;Baby, I love you so&quot;, or &quot;Baby, you&#x27;ve done me wrong&quot;. Now, when people look at songs, when I play anybody on the planet this song, and I say &quot;What is this?&quot;, they will say, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s Reggae&quot;, or &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s Heavy Metal&quot;, or &quot;That&#x27;s Country &amp; Western&quot;, or &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s Opera&quot;, you know what I mean? But that&#x27;s not what I asked. They&#x27;re answering a question I didn&#x27;t ask. What they&#x27;re saying is &quot;That&#x27;s the music&quot;. What I&#x27;m saying is &quot;What is the song?&quot; And the song is either &quot;I&#x27;ve done you wrong&quot;, or, &quot;Baby, I love you so&quot;, no matter what style it&#x27;s played in. In other words, there&#x27;s a huge difference between content and style, and, if you work more towards content, why not make it content that is original.

If it&#x27;s already been written, why write it again? If it&#x27;s already been said, why say it again? I mean there are some remarkable quotes that I love. But I didn&#x27;t say them. And you don&#x27;t want to pass them off as your own work. Napoleon said that &quot;Time spent in reconnaissance is never wasted&quot;. And that, actually, has governed my life. You know what I mean? That&#x27;s a quote you can live by. But it&#x27;s not my quote. So if I say it I always credit it to Napoleon. There is another way of saying any of the things you want to say, rather than rehashing someone else&#x27;s words.

I think of songs as cinema, really. It&#x27;s aural cinema. I want to show you a movie when I&#x27;m playing a song. That&#x27;s essentially what I&#x27;m doing. And, of course, the songs are geographical too. One of the ways I get inspired to write a song – and this will always produce a song that sounds like nothing else (I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough) – I just open a world atlas, just at random, and whatever page I&#x27;m looking at, at least six songs immediately occur to me.

So, if you look at pretty much any of the songs, a lot of them are geographical, historical, and form a movie.

<text>John Alfred Larsson (2 April 1938 – 18 March 2022) was a Swedish Salvationist, writer and composer of Christian music and hymns, who was the 17th General of The Salvation Army.

==Biography==
The son of officer Sture Larsson and Flora Ethel Mildred Benwell, he spent his early years in his native Sweden, in Denmark, Chile and Argentina. Even his grandparents were officers in The Salvation Army, and his grandfather on his father&#x27;s side, Commissioner Karl Larsson, is known in the Army&#x27;s history as the one who &quot;opened fire&quot; in Russia the first time (1914). John Larsson became an officer in 1957 from the Upper Norwood Corps, London, England. He graduated from the University of London with a BD degree.

After a year as a corps officer in the north of England, he served on the staff of the International Training College in London for seven years before returning to corps appointments.

Larsson and Captain Freda Turner were married in 1969 while Larsson was stationed at the corps in Ealing. They have two sons, Karl Larsson and Kevin Larsson, who are both members of The Salvation Army.

Larsson and his wife were appointed to the South America West Territory in 1980, he as Chief Secretary and she as Territorial Home League Secretary. In 1984, they were appointed to the International Training College as principal and librarian, respectively. They were appointed to International Headquarters in London in 1988. Larsson, as assistant to the Chief of the Staff for United Kingdom administrative planning, was given the task of researching and planning for the separation of the international and national administrations. Freda Larsson served as coordinator for married women officers.

The Larssons were then appointed Territorial Commander and Territorial President of Women&#x27;s Organisations for the United Kingdom Territory with the Republic of Ireland in 1990. In 1993, they were appointed territorial leaders for the New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga Territory; and in 1996, they received similar appointments for the Sweden and Latvia Territory.

Larsson was the author of &quot;Doctrine Without Tears&quot;, &quot;The Man Perfectly Filled with the Spirit&quot;, &quot;Spiritual Breakthrough&quot; and &quot;How Your Corps Can Grow&quot;. He is also the author of &quot;1929&quot;, a history of the events that took place that year in The Salvation Army, &quot;Inside a High Council&quot;, explaining the workings of The Salvation Army High Council, and &quot;Those incredible Booths: William and Catherine Booth as parents&quot;.

Larsson was also a composer and, together with John Gowans, co-authored ten full-length stage musicals, &quot;Take-Over Bid&quot; (1967), &quot;Hosea&quot; (1969), &quot;Jesus Folk&quot; (1972), &quot;Spirit&quot; (1973), &quot;Glory&quot; (1975), &quot;White Rose&quot; (1977), &quot;The Blood Of The Lamb&quot; (1978), &quot;Son Of Man&quot; (1983), &quot;Man Mark II&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Meeting&quot; (1990).

In 1999, Larsson became chief of the staff, second-in-command of The Salvation Army worldwide. His wife became World Secretary for Women&#x27;s Organisations (later Women&#x27;s Ministries).

Larsson was elected General on 6 September 2002, and assumed the office following the retirement of his predecessor, General John Gowans. Shaw Clifton succeeded to the office of General when Larsson retired at midnight on 1 April 2006.

Larsson died at his home in Bromley, London on 18 March 2022, at the age of 83.

<text>Nevado del Ruiz (), also known as La Mesa de Herveo () is a volcano on the border of the departments of Caldas and Tolima in Colombia, being the highest point of both. It is located about west of the capital city Bogotá. It is a stratovolcano composed of many layers of lava alternating with hardened volcanic ash and other pyroclastic rocks. Volcanic activity at Nevado del Ruiz began about two million years ago, during the Early Pleistocene or Late Pliocene, with three major eruptive periods. The current volcanic cone formed during the present eruptive period, which began 150,000 years ago.

The volcano usually generates Vulcanian to Plinian eruptions, which produce swift-moving currents of hot gas and rock called pyroclastic flows. These eruptions often cause massive lahars (mud and debris flows), which pose a threat to human life and the environment. The impact of such an eruption is increased as the hot gas and lava melt the mountain&#x27;s snowcap, adding large quantities of water to the flow. On November 13, 1985, a small eruption produced an enormous lahar that buried and destroyed the town of Armero in Tolima, causing an estimated 25,000 deaths. This event later became known as the Armero tragedy—the deadliest lahar in recorded history. Similar but less deadly incidents occurred in 1595 and 1845, consisting of a small explosive eruption followed by a large lahar.

The volcano is part of Los Nevados National Natural Park, which also contains several other volcanoes. The summit of Nevado del Ruiz is covered by large glaciers. The volcano continues to pose a threat to the nearby towns and villages, and it is estimated that up to 500,000 people could be at risk from lahars from future eruptions. Today, the Nevado del Ruiz volcano is constantly monitored by the Colombian Geological Survey via the Volcanic and Seismic Observatory of Manizales.

== Geography and geology ==

Nevado del Ruiz, which lies about west of Bogotá, is part of the Andes mountain range. The volcano is part of the Ruiz–Tolima volcanic massif (or Cordillera Central), a group of five ice-capped volcanoes which also includes the Tolima, Santa Isabel, Quindio and Machin volcanoes. The massif is located at the intersection of four faults, some of which are still active.

Nevado del Ruiz lies within the Pacific Ring of Fire, a region that encircles the Pacific Ocean and contains some of the world&#x27;s most active volcanoes. It is the third most northernly of the volcanoes lying in the North Volcanic Zone of the Andean Volcanic Belt, which contains 75 of the 204 Holocene-age volcanoes in South America. The Andean Volcanic Belt is produced by the eastward subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate beneath the South American continental plate. As is the case for many subduction-zone volcanoes, Nevado del Ruiz can generate explosive Plinian eruptions with associated pyroclastic flows that can melt snow and glaciers near the summit, producing large and sometimes devastating lahars (mud and debris flows).

Like many other Andean volcanoes, Nevado del Ruiz is a stratovolcano: a voluminous, roughly conical volcano consisting of many strata of hardened lava and tephra including volcanic ash. Its lavas are andesitic–dacitic in composition. The modern volcanic cone comprises five lava domes, all constructed within the caldera of an ancestral Ruiz volcano: Nevado El Cisne, Alto de la Laguna, La Olleta, Alto la Pirana, and Alto de Santano. It covers an area of more than , stretching from east to west. The mountain&#x27;s broad summit includes the Arenas crater, which is in diameter and deep. Nevado del Ruiz, as its neighbours to the southwest Nevado El Cisne and Nevado de Santa Isabel is located over the Palestina Fault that crosscuts the underlying El Bosque Batholith, dated at 49.1 ± 1.7 Ma.

The summit of the volcano has steep slopes inclining from 20 to 30 degrees. At lower elevations, the slopes become less steep; their inclination is about 10 degrees. From there on, foothills stretch almost to the edge of the Magdalena River, north of the volcano and the Cauca River to the west. On the two major sides of the summit, headwalls show where past rock avalanches occurred. At times, ice on the summit has melted, generating devastating lahars, including the continent&#x27;s deadliest eruption in 1985. On the volcano&#x27;s southwest flank is the pyroclastic cone La Olleta, which is not currently active, but may have erupted in historical times.

=== Glaciers ===

The summit of Nevado del Ruiz is covered by glaciers (&quot;nevado&quot; means &quot;snow-covered&quot; in Spanish), which formed over many thousands of years, and have generally retreated since the last glacial maximum. From 28,000 to 21,000 years ago, glaciers occupied about of the Ruiz–Tolima massif. As late as 12,000 years ago, when the ice sheets from the last glacial period were retreating, they still covered . During the Little Ice Age, which lasted from about 1600 to 1900 CE, the ice cap covered approximately .

Since then the glaciers have retreated further because of atmospheric warming. By 1959, the massif&#x27;s glaciated area had dropped to . Since the 1985 eruption, which destroyed about 10% of the summit ice cover, the area of Nevado del Ruiz covered by glaciers has halved—from just after the eruption to about in 2003. The glaciers reached altitudes as low as in 1985 but have now retreated to elevations of .

The ice cap is approximately thick on average. It is thickest in parts of the summit plateau and under the Nereides Glacier on the southwestern slopes, where it is as deep as . Glaciers on the northern and, to a lesser extent, the eastern slopes lost the most ice in the 1985 eruption, and therefore reach only up to deep. The deep ice covering the summit plateau may hide a caldera. Five domes ringing the summit plateau have emerged as the ice has retreated.

The meltwater from the glaciers drains primarily to the Cauca River and Magdalena River via the western and eastern flanks of the volcano, respectively. Runoff from these glaciers and those on the surrounding volcanoes is a source of fresh water for forty surrounding towns, and Colombian scientists and government officials are concerned about the towns&#x27; water supply should the glaciers melt completely.

== Flora and fauna ==

Nevado del Ruiz is generally poorly forested because of its high elevation, and its forest cover decreases with increasing elevation. At lower elevations, well-developed mesic forests (20–35 meters / 66–110 ft high) are present. Above these but below the tree line, parts of the volcano are covered with dwarf forests high. Above the tree line, in the Páramo zone, the vegetation is dominated by plants such as bunchgrass and Espeletia. Regional vegetation consists of different families of woody plants, including Rubiaceae, Leguminosae, Melastomataceae, Lauraceae, and Moraceae. Flowers such as &quot;Polypodiaceae s.l.&quot;, Araceae, Poaceae, Asteraceae, Piperaceae, and Orchidaceae are also present in the region.

Animals living on the volcano include the mountain tapir and spectacled bear, both of which are designated as threatened. Other animals inhabiting the surrounding region include the rufous-fronted parakeet, buffy helmetcrest, and Herveo plump toad. The volcano is home to 27 species of birds endemic to Colombia, with 14 of these species confined to the region around the volcano. 15 bird species in the area are considered threatened.

== Los Nevados National Park ==

Nevado del Ruiz is one of several stratovolcanoes within Los Nevados National Natural Park, a national park located west of Bogotá in the centre of the Colombian Andes. The park is a popular tourist destination and contains several tourist shelters. The slopes of the volcano are used for winter sports, and nearby Lake Otún offers trout fishing. A number of commercially operated spas can be found nearby. In 1868–1869, German geologists Wilhelm Reiss and Alphons Stübel were the first to attempt to climb Ruiz. In 1936, W. Cunet and Augusto Gansser-Biaggi made the first successful ascent, partly by ski; they repeated the ascent in 1939.

== Eruptive history ==
The first eruptions of Nevado del Ruiz occurred about 1.8 million years ago at the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch. Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: &quot;ancestral&quot;, &quot;older&quot; and &quot;present&quot;. During the &quot;ancestral&quot; period between one million to two million years ago, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10 km wide) calderas. During the &quot;older&quot; period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million years ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago.

The &quot;present&quot; period began about 150,000 years ago and involved the development of the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. During the past 11,000 years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano&#x27;s earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them.

During recorded history, eruptions have consisted primarily of a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz&#x27;s earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660 BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245 BC ± 150 years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850 BC, 200 BC ± 100 years, 350 AD ± 300 years, 675 AD ± 50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September 1985 – July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a phreatic (steam) explosion. Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after Galeras.

=== 1595 lahar ===
On November 13, 1595, Nevado del Ruiz erupted. The episode consisted of three Plinian eruptions, which were heard up to from the summit of the volcano. A large amount of ash was ejected, which completely darkened the surrounding area. The volcano also erupted lapilli (a form of tephra) and pumice bombs. In total, the eruption produced 0.16 km3 of tephra. The eruption was preceded by a large precursor earthquake three days before. The eruption caused lahars, which traveled down the valleys of the nearby Gualí and Lagunillas rivers, clogging up the water, killing fish and destroying vegetation. More than 600 people died as a result of the lahar. The 1595 eruption was the last major eruption of Nevado del Ruiz before 1985. The 1595 and 1985 eruptions were similar in many respects, including in the chemical composition of the erupted material.

=== 1845 lahar ===
On the morning of February 19, 1845, a large earthquake resulted in a substantial mudflow. This mudflow flowed down the valley of the Lagunillas River for approximately , spilling out of the river channel and killing much of the local population. After reaching an alluvial fan, the mudflow split into two branches. The larger portion of it joined the Lagunillas River and flowed into the nearby Magdalena River, while the smaller portion was diverted by hills in front of Lagunillas Canyon, turned 90 degrees to the north until it reached the Sabandija River, and then flowed east with the Sabandija River, until it rejoined the other branch of the mudflow at the junction of the Sabandija and the Magdalena. It is estimated that 1000 people were killed in the mudflows.

=== Eruption (1985) ===
Beginning November 1984, geologists observed an increasing level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. Such volcanic tectonic seismicity is often a precursor of an upcoming eruption. Other signs of a forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on the summit of the volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.

An Italian volcanological mission analyzed gas samples from fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and proved them to be a mixture of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. The mission&#x27;s report, delivered on October 22, 1985, judged the risk of lahars to be very high. The report proposed various simple preparedness techniques to local authorities.

In November 1985, volcanic activity once again increased as magma neared the surface. The volcano began releasing increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur dioxide and elementary sulfur. The water content of the fumaroles&#x27; gases decreased, and water springs in the vicinity of Nevado del Ruiz became enriched in magnesium, calcium and potassium, which were leached from the magma. The thermodynamic equilibration (stationary heat energy) temperatures, corresponding to the chemical composition of the discharged gases, were from to . The extensive degassing of the magma caused pressure to build up inside the volcano, which eventually resulted in the explosive eruption.

==== Eruption and lahars ====
At 3:06 pm, on November 13, 1985, Nevado del Ruiz began to erupt, ejecting dacitic tephra more than into the atmosphere. The total mass of the erupted material (including magma) was 35 million tonnes—only 3% of the amount that erupted from Mount St. Helens in 1980. The eruption reached a value of 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. The mass of the ejected sulfur dioxide was about 700,000 tonnes, or about 2% of the mass of the erupted solid material, making the eruption atypically sulfur-rich.

The eruption produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano&#x27;s flanks. It also destroyed a small lake that was observed in Arenas crater several months before the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty and contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake&#x27;s hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice; this effect was confirmed by the large amounts of sulfates and chlorides found in the lahar flow.

The lahars, formed of water, ice, pumice, and other rocks, mixed with clay as they travelled down the volcano&#x27;s flanks. They ran down the volcano&#x27;s sides at an average speed of 60 km per hour, eroding soil, dislodging rock, and destroying vegetation. After descending thousands of meters down the side of the volcano, the lahars were directed into all of the six river valleys leading from the volcano. While in the river valleys, the lahars grew to almost 4 times their original volume. In the Gualí River, a lahar reached a maximum width of 50m (164ft).
One of the lahars virtually erased the town of Armero in Tolima, which lay in the Lagunilla River valley. Only one quarter of its 28,700 inhabitants survived. The second lahar, which descended through the valley of Chinchiná River, killed about 1,800 people and destroyed about 400 homes in the town of Chinchiná, in the department of Caldas. In total, over 23,000 people were killed and approximately 5,000 were injured. More than 5,000 homes were destroyed. The Armero tragedy, as the event came to be known, was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster in the 20th century, being surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic eruption in recorded history. It is also the deadliest known lahar, and Colombia&#x27;s worst natural disaster. A young girl named Omayra Sánchez became a worldwide symbol of the disaster after images of her trapped under the debris of her former home, after the eruption made the news worldwide.

The loss of life during the 1985 eruption was due partly to the fact that scientists did not know precisely when the eruption would occur, and the authorities would not take costly preventive measures without clear warnings of imminent danger. Because the volcano&#x27;s last substantial eruption occurred more than 140 years earlier, it was also hard for many to accept the danger the volcano presented; locals even called it the &quot;Sleeping Lion&quot;. Hazard maps showing Armero would be completely flooded after an eruption were distributed more than a month before the eruption, but the Colombian Congress criticized the scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering. Local authorities failed to alert people to the seriousness of the situation, with Armero&#x27;s mayor and a priest both reassuring the populace after an ash eruption on the afternoon of November 13 and the consequent ashfall early that evening. Another factor was the storm that hit that evening, causing electrical outages and hindering communications. Civil defense officials from four nearby towns tried to warn Armero the lahar was approaching in the hour or so before it reached Armero, but failed to make radio contact.

Scientists later looked back to the hours before the eruption and noticed that several long-period earthquakes, which start out strong and then slowly die out, had occurred in the final hours before the eruption. Volcanologist Bernard Chouet said that, &quot;the volcano was screaming &#x27;I&#x27;m about to explode&#x27;&quot;, but the scientists who were studying the volcano at the time of the eruption were not able to read this signal.

== Current threats and preparedness ==


The volcano continues to pose a serious threat to nearby towns and villages. The most likely hazard is small-volume eruptions, which might destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars. Despite the significant retrenchment of the volcano&#x27;s glaciers, the volume of ice atop Nevado del Ruiz and other volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif remains large. Melting merely 10% of the ice would produce mudflows with a volume of up to —similar to the mudflow that destroyed Armero in 1985. Such lahars can travel up to along river valleys in a matter of few hours. Estimates show that up to 500,000 people living in the Combeima, Chinchiná, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are in danger, and 100,000 of these are considered to be at high risk. Lahars pose a threat to nearby towns of Honda, Mariquita, Ambalema, Chinchiná, Herveo, Villa Hermosa, Salgar and La Dorada. Although small eruptions are more likely, the two million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating that the threat of a large eruption cannot be ignored.
A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogotá&#x27;s airport due to ashfall.

As the Armero tragedy was exacerbated by the lack of early warnings, unwise land use, and the unpreparedness of nearby communities, the government of Colombia created a special program (&quot;Oficina Nacional para la Atencion de Desastres&quot;, 1987) to prevent such incidents in the future. All Colombian cities were directed to promote prevention planning in order to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters, and evacuations due to volcanic hazards have been carried out. About 2,300 people living along five nearby rivers were evacuated when Nevado del Ruiz erupted again in 1989. When another Colombian volcano, the Nevado del Huila, erupted in April 2008, thousands of people were evacuated because volcanologists worried that the eruption could be another &quot;Nevado del Ruiz&quot;. In October 2022, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) listed Nevado del Ruiz as one of 100 &quot;geological heritage sites&quot; for being among the &quot;best-studied volcanoes in the world&quot; and a &quot;model for volcanic risk management&quot;.

In 2006, heavy rains on Ruiz sent a mudslide down the Chinchiná River, killing nine children aged 12–19 on a scouting expedition near the volcano.

=== Recent activity ===

During September and October 2010, the Colombian Geological Survey noted gradual increases in seismic activity near the Arenas crater. Sulfurous odors and phreatic eruptions reported at Nevado del Ruiz prompted an alert level of Yellow on October 1. Chemical analysis of the volcano demonstrated deformative changes and geochemical alterations. Over the next four months a smattering of long-period earthquakes, considered pseudo-Tornillo events, raised worries that the volcano might erupt. In 2010, tilt increased, and on average 890 volcanic tremors were recorded monthly, roughly eight times as many as had been recorded from 2009 to 2010.

Scientists flying over the volcano on March 8, 2012, noted fresh ash deposits on the east flank of the volcano near the crater, likely from an phreatic eruption on February 22. Later that day, a small ash plume erupted from the crater; by March 13, scientists detected ash deposits at the head of the Gualí River. After seismicity continued to increase, the alert level was raised to Orange, and in April Nevados National Natural Park authority closed the reserve, fearing lahars and ashfall hazards. The sudden activity peak in March did not culminate in a major eruption, and activity declined enough that the alert level was lowered to Yellow on May 3. On May 29, seismicity rapidly increased, and the alert level was restored to Orange because ash fell into more than 20 nearby communities. Over the next few months ash fell frequently until earthquakes increased again in June. Because of the severity of these tremors, evacuations were ordered by the Emergency Committee of Caldas on news media for 300–1500 people near the volcano. The alert level was raised to Red, indicating an imminent major volcanic event, and an eruption in diameter took place on July 2, 2012, continuing intermittently until the end of August. Ash plumes and sulfur dioxide emissions recurred until January 2013.

Through the beginning of July 2013, ashfall took place at Nevado del Ruiz a few times per month. On July 11, 2013, there was a relatively large explosion, followed by inactivity until August, when emission of ash resumed, continuing intermittently until April 2014. Reports of ashfall stopped until October 2014. In November 2014, earthquakes were recorded, and volcanic ash was observed near the summit; ashfall reached local communities within a radius of Nevado del Ruiz multiple times each month until December 2015. A lava dome was extruded from August to the end of October in 2015, coinciding with thermal anomalies increasing near the summit crater at the end of the same year. According to the Global Volcanism Program, the last documented eruption at Nevado del Ruiz took place in 2017. However, reports from the Servicio Geológico Colombiano observatory at Manizales through the end of October 2018 suggested earthquakes near the volcano, with phreatic eruptions ejecting water vapor, volcanic ash, and volcanic gases up to over its crater. In March 2023, seismic activity around the volcano dramatically increased, prompting the Colombian Geological Survey to raise the alert level from yellow to orange. Families living in the area near the volcano were evacuated, and local schools transitioned to online classes; Los Nevados Natural Park was closed. Ultimately, in June 2023, the threat level was lowered back to yellow without an eruption.

<text>Arkansas State University (A-State or ASU) is a public research university in Jonesboro, Arkansas. It is the flagship campus of the Arkansas State University System and the second largest university in the state. The university was founded in 1909 and is located atop on Crowley&#x27;s Ridge.

Arkansas State University is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

==History==
A-State was founded as the First District Agricultural School in Jonesboro in 1909 by the Arkansas Legislature as a regional agricultural training school. Robert W. Glover, a Missionary Baptist pastor who served in both houses of the Arkansas Legislature from Sheridan (1905–1912), introduced in 1909 the resolution calling for the establishment of four state agricultural colleges, including the future ASU.

In 1918, ASU began offering a two-year college program. In 1925, it became First District Agricultural and Mechanical College. A four-year degree program was begun in 1930. A &amp; M College became Arkansas State College in 1933. In 1967, the Arkansas Legislature elevated the college to university status and changed the name to Arkansas State University.

In the fall of 2014, A-State welcomed its most academically prepared freshman class. The result of several years of growing both admission standards and increasing on-campus housing, A-State&#x27;s incoming first-year first-time student composite ACT was 23.9 with an average high school GPA of 3.47 (Current freshman ACTs are 20-26 and the average high school GPA is 3.7). This was the third consecutive year of improvement for the ACT/GPA freshman classes for Arkansas State. The Arkansas State Honors College has grown 59% since 2009. The university also posted back-to-back high graduate counts in spring 2012 and spring 2013, producing the most graduates in a two-year period in school history. The university contains the largest library in the state of Arkansas, the Dean B. Ellis Library.

==Academics==
The university has more than 100,000 alumni and offers programs at the doctoral, specialist&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, bachelor&#x27;s, and associate degree levels. They are organized into several colleges: Agriculture, Engineering &amp; Technology, Business, Education &amp; Behavioral Science, Liberal Arts &amp; Communication, Nursing &amp; Health Professions, Sciences &amp; Mathematics, and Undergraduate Studies.

In 2018, Arkansas State was classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. The university nevertheless maintains a focus on undergraduate instruction and small class sizes, with a student-faculty ratio of 16:1, ranked #76 in undergraduate teaching nationwide . The university is ranked #1013 (UniRank 2024-2025), #1119 (SCImago Rankings 2018), and #1645 (URAP Rankings 2020-2021) in the global university rankings.

Master&#x27;s degree graduate programs were initiated in 1955 and ASU began offering its first doctoral degree, in educational leadership, in the fall of 1992. A second doctoral program, in environmental science, was begun in the fall of 1997 and the doctoral program in heritage studies began in the fall of 2001. Newer doctoral programs are in environmental science, molecular biosciences, and physical therapy. In the fall of 2016, Arkansas State enrolled the first class of approximately 115 students to its branch of the New York Institute of Technology&#x27;s medical school. The medical school is located on campus in the historic Wilson Hall.
== Media ==
A-State&#x27;s journalism program reorganized into the College of Media and Communication for fall 2013. The College of Media and Communication is home to three student-led media outlets and a NPR affiliate radio station. &quot;The Herald&quot;, a weekly student newspaper, was founded in 1921 and has a circulation of 5,000. &quot;ASU-TV&quot;, a program under the Department of Radio-Television, gives students hands-on experience in the field of television broadcasting. Starting in fall 2013, an Internet-based student radio station, &quot;Red Wolf Radio&quot;, was added to the student media. Arkansas State is also home to &quot;KASU&quot;, a 100,000-watt FM station, which is the oldest NPR affiliate west of the Mississippi River.

==Athletics==

Arkansas State participates as a member of the NCAA Division I Sun Belt Conference. The athletic teams, previously known as the Indians, are now known as the Red Wolves.

In 2012, the Red Wolves football team became Sun Belt Conference champions for a second straight year, finishing the regular season with a 9–3 record, and capped off its successful season with its first bowl game victory since becoming a Division I-A (FBS) program with a 17–13 victory over Kent State in the GoDaddy.com Bowl, as well as earning its first win over a ranked opponent since joining the FBS in 1992.

In 2013, the football team became the Sun Belt Conference champions for a third straight year, finishing with a 7–5 regular season record and won a second consecutive GoDaddy Bowl with a 23–20 victory over then 10-2 Ball State.

==Greek life==

<text>The Greening Earth Society, now defunct, was a public relations organization which denied the effects of climate change and the impacts of increased levels of carbon dioxide. The Society published the World Climate Report, a newsletter edited by Patrick Michaels of the Cato Institute.

It was a non-profit organization created by the Western Fuels Association, with which it shared an office and many staff members. It has been called a &quot;front group created by the coal industry&quot; and an &quot;industry front&quot;. Fred Palmer, a Society staffer, is a registered lobbyist for Peabody Energy, a coal company.

Although the Greening Earth Society generally rejected the science of climate change, it acknowledged some degree of global warming as real: &quot;Fact #1. The rate of global warming during the past several decades has been about 0.18°C per decade&quot;. Note that the actual increase in the global surface temperature during the 100 years ending in 2005 was 0.74 ± 0.18 °C.

<text>Indiana limestone (also known as Bedford limestone) is a form of limestone used as a building material, particularly for monumental public structures. Some 35 of the 50 state capitol buildings in the United States are made of Indiana limestone, as are the Empire State Building, Biltmore Estate, the Pentagon and National Cathedral in Washington, D.C..

Indiana limestone is a more common term for [[Salem Limestone]], a geological formation primarily quarried in south central Indiana, USA, between the cities of Bloomington and Bedford. It has been called the best quarried limestone in the United States. 

Indiana limestone, like all limestone, is a rock primarily formed of calcium carbonate. It was deposited over millions of years as marine fossils decomposed at the bottom of a shallow inland sea which covered most of the present-day Midwestern United States during the Mississippian Period.

== History ==

Native Americans were the first people to discover limestone in Indiana. Not long after they arrived, American settlers used this rock around their windows and doors and for memorials around the towns. The first quarry was started in 1827, and by 1929 Hoosier quarries yielded 12,000,000 ft3 (340,000 cubic meters) of usable stone. The expansion of the railroads brought great need for limestone to build bridges and tunnels and Indiana was the place to get it.

American architecture of the late 19th and early 20th century included a lot of limestone detail work on buildings, but as architectural styles changed, so did the demand for limestone. Indiana limestone was officially designated as the state stone of Indiana by the Indiana General Assembly in 1971. With the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973, the price of alternative building materials skyrocketed so Indiana limestone reemerged as an energy-efficient building material.

== Use in notable buildings ==
===Local===
Many of Indiana&#x27;s official buildings, such as the State capitol building, the monuments in Downtown Indianapolis, the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, many university buildings, and the Indiana Government Center, and most of the state&#x27;s 92 courthouses are all examples of Indiana architecture made with Indiana limestone. The majority of Indiana University, Bloomington, was constructed out of limestone. 1959&#x27;s architecturally significant St. Augustine&#x27;s Episcopal Church, in Gary, Indiana, uses Indiana limestone in the interior. The Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church in Merrillville, Indiana, consecrated in 1991 and awarded a Gold Medal Award for Excellence in Masonry Design, uses Indiana limestone on its exterior facade.

===National===
Nationally, Indiana limestone has long been part of a high-end market. It has mostly been used on the exteriors of homes and commercial and government buildings. 

Many prominent public buildings in the United States — such as the National Cathedral, Biltmore Estate, Empire State Building, the Pentagon, The Crescent in Dallas, and the Hotel Pennsylvania — feature Indiana limestone in their exteriors. Some 35 of the 50 state capitol buildings in the United States are made of Indiana limestone. It was used extensively in rebuilding Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The sculptural group atop the main façade of New York City&#x27;s Grand Central Terminal — known as &quot;Glory of Commerce&quot; — is made of Indiana Limestone. (A work by Jules-Félix Coutan, it includes representations of Minerva, Hercules, and Mercury and, at its unveiling in 1914, was considered the largest sculptural group in the world.) 

The original 1930s buildings of Rockefeller Center use limestone from Bedford. In 1955 the Tennessee State Capitol exterior was renovated using Indiana limestone to replace the poorer-quality Tennessee limestone that had started to deteriorate. Some 15,000 cubic feet of Indiana limestone was used in the rebuilding of the Pentagon after the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001. The new Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, which opened in 2009, extensively uses Indiana limestone paneling on its exterior facade. 

Indiana limestone has been particularly popular for the construction of university buildings. The Neo-Gothic campus of the University of Chicago is almost entirely constructed out of Indiana limestone; in keeping with the trend of post-Fire buildings using the material. The campus of Washington University in St. Louis – both for new construction and original buildings – makes use of Indiana limestone in its collegiate gothic architecture. Many buildings on the north side of Michigan State University use Indiana limestone. The Cathedral of Learning, a 42-story neo-gothic skyscraper that is the largest educational building in the Western Hemisphere, along with other nearby buildings of the University of Pittsburgh, are clad in Indiana limestone. The St. Anthony Society Chapter House at Yale University also is built of Indiana limestone. Many of the gargoyles on the buildings of Princeton University were carved from Indiana limestone, including &quot;Flute Player&quot;, located on the exterior of Firestone Library. Both structures of the Kenosha County Courthouse and Jail in Kenosha, Wisconsin, were built out of the limestone. This stone was used as far north as the Hotel Macdonald in Edmonton. The Nebraska State Capitol is clad in Indiana Limestone, after native limestone was deemed too prone to weathering.

Because of the awareness of acid rain, which wears Indiana Limestone relatively quickly, the stone is not as often used in monuments today as it was in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

===Canada===

The limestone has been used in buildings outside of the United States and namely in Canada:

* Canada Life Building, Toronto 1931
* Canadian Pacific Building, Toronto - recladded in 1929
* Fairmont Royal York, Toronto 1931
* Lillian Massey Building, Toronto 1913
* Toronto Harbour Commission Building 1917 (mix of Indiana And Queenston limestone)
* Union Station (Toronto) 1927 (mix of Indiana And Queenston limestone)

<text>Rare Limited is a British video game developer and a studio of Xbox Game Studios based in Twycross, Leicestershire. Rare&#x27;s games span the platform, first-person shooter, action-adventure, fighting, and racing genres. Its most popular games include the &quot;Battletoads&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, and &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; series, as well as games like &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; (1997), &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; (2000), &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; (2001), &quot;Viva Piñata&quot; (2006), and &quot;Sea of Thieves&quot; (2018).

Tim and Chris Stamper, who also founded Ultimate Play the Game, established Rare in 1985. During its early years, Rare was backed by a generous budget from Nintendo, primarily concentrated on Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games. During this time, Rare created successful games such as &quot;Wizards &amp; Warriors&quot; (1987), &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot; (1988), and &quot;Battletoads&quot; (1991). Rare became a prominent second-party developer for Nintendo, which came to own a large minority stake in the company, with the release of &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; (1994). Throughout the 1990s, Rare started selling their games under the trademark name &quot;Rareware&quot; and received international recognition and critical acclaim for games such as the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; series, &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; (1994), &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; (1998), &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; (2000), and &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; (2001).

In 2002, Microsoft acquired Rare, which retained its original brand, logo, and most intellectual properties. Rare has since focused on developing games exclusively for Microsoft&#x27;s video game consoles, including &quot;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&quot; (2003), &quot;Kameo&quot; (2005), &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; (2005), and &quot;Viva Piñata&quot; (2006). In 2007, the Stampers left Rare to pursue other opportunities and, in 2010, the company&#x27;s focus shifted to the Xbox Live Avatar and Kinect, releasing three &quot;Kinect Sports&quot; games. In 2015, Rare developed &quot;Rare Replay&quot;, an Xbox One-exclusive compilation containing 30 of its games to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Rare&#x27;s most recent game, &quot;Sea of Thieves&quot;, was released in 2018.

Several former Rare employees have formed their own companies, such as Free Radical Design, best known for producing the &quot;TimeSplitters&quot; series, and Playtonic Games, best known for &quot;Yooka-Laylee&quot; (2017). Rare is widely acknowledged in the video game industry and has received numerous accolades from critics and journalists. Rare is also known as a secretive and seclusive studio. Several Rare games, such as &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; and &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, have been cited as among the greatest and most influential games of all time, though some fans and former employees have been critical of the company&#x27;s output under Microsoft.

==History==

===Founding (1985–1993)===
Rare evolved from the company Ultimate Play the Game, which was founded in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire by former arcade game developers Tim and Chris Stamper. After multiple critically and commercially successful releases including &quot;Jetpac&quot;, &quot;Atic Atac&quot;, &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;, and &quot;Knight Lore&quot;, Ultimate Play The Game was one of the biggest UK-based video game development companies. The ZX Spectrum home computer, the platform the company usually developed games for, was only popular in the UK, and they believed that working on that platform would not be beneficial to the company&#x27;s growth as they considered it a &quot;dead end&quot;. Meanwhile, the company inspected an imported console from Japan, the Famicom, and believed that it would be an ideal future platform of choice for the company as it was more sophisticated than the Spectrum, it had a worldwide market, and its cartridges had no load times. As a result, Rare was established in 1985. Its main goal was to reverse-engineer the console and investigate the codes for Famicom&#x27;s games to learn more about the console&#x27;s programming. With successful results, the company decided to sell the Ultimate brand to U.S. Gold, and ceased game development for the ZX Spectrum in the following year.

The Famicom&#x27;s manufacturer, Nintendo, claimed that it was impossible to reverse engineer the console. Using the information the Ultimate Play the Game team acquired from Rare, the team prepared several tech demos and showed them to the Nintendo executive Minoru Arakawa in Kyoto. Impressed with their efforts, Nintendo decided to grant the Ultimate Play the Game team an unlimited budget for them to work on games for the Famicom platform. After they returned to England, they moved from Ashby-de-la-Zouch to Twycross, and established a new studio through Rare. They set their headquarters in a Manor Farmhouse. Rare also set up another company known as Rare, Inc., in Miami, Florida. Headed by Joel Hochberg, the American company was involved in maintaining Rare&#x27;s operation in the US and contacting major US publishers. Hochberg was previously the vice president of American arcade manufacturer Centuri. The Famicom was eventually released in North America and Europe under the name Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).
With the unlimited budget, Rare could work a large variety of different games. The first project Rare worked on was &quot;Slalom&quot;, a downhill skiing game. The company then worked with various gaming publishers that included Tradewest, Acclaim Entertainment, Electronic Arts, Sega, Mindscape, and Gametek to produce sixty games over a five-year period, forty-seven of which were for the NES, while the rest were conversions for the Game Boy and Sega Genesis. They helped in creating new and original intellectual properties, including &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot;, a racing game with vehicular combat elements, and &quot;Snake Rattle &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, an action platform game with Tim Stamper developing the game&#x27;s graphics. Rare also developed &quot;Battletoads&quot;, a beat&#x27;em up inspired by the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; franchise. The game became known for its extreme difficulty, and upon seeing success, publisher Tradewest published multiple ports for the game, and tasked Rare to develop sequels. Tradewest also gave their own &quot;Double Dragon&quot; licence to Rare, allowing them to develop a crossover game between the two franchises. Rare released three &quot;Battletoads&quot; games in 1993, including &quot;Battletoads / Double Dragon: The Ultimate Team&quot;, &quot;Battletoads in Ragnarok&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Battletoads in Battlemaniacs&quot;. The last &quot;Battletoads&quot; game from that era was released for the arcade in 1994. Several &quot;Battletoads&quot; games were also ported to some Sega&#x27;s systems like the Mega Drive/Genesis.

Rare worked on licensed properties such as &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, and ports including &quot;Marble Madness&quot;, &quot;Narc&quot;, and &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates!&quot;. The development of four of Rare&#x27;s games were outsourced to Zippo Games, including &quot;Wizards &amp; Warriors&quot; and the third instalment of the &quot;Jetpac&quot; series, &quot;Solar Jetman: Hunt for the Golden Warship&quot;. Rare eventually acquired Zippo Games and renamed them to Rare Manchester. According to Ste Pickford, a Rare team member through the late 80s and the early 90s, Rare just &quot;wanted to make as many games as they could in their &#x27;window of opportunity&#x27;&quot;. The huge library of games made large profits, but none became a critical success for the company while less creativity and innovation were shown in them.

When the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was conceived, Rare was not yet ready for the change. Rare limited their releases to some &quot;Battletoads&quot; games and decided to invest their significant NES profit in purchasing expensive Silicon Graphics workstations to make three-dimensional models. This move made Rare the most technologically advanced developer in the UK, and situated them high in the international market. Their priority also changed at that time, as the team decided to focus on quality instead of quantity.

===Partnership with Nintendo (1994–2002)===

Rare, using the SGI systems, created a boxing game demo and presented it to Nintendo. As the SNES at that time could not render all of the SGI graphics at once, Rare used the SGI graphics to produce 3D models and graphics, before pre-rendering these graphics onto the cartridge of the SNES system, a process known as &quot;Advanced Computer Modelling&quot;. Their progress with the 3D graphics on the SGI systems impressed Nintendo, and in 1994, Nintendo bought a 25% stake in the company that gradually increased to 49%, making Rare a second-party developer for Nintendo. Rare maintained autonomous operations, green-lighting and designing projects without significant involvement from Nintendo.

During this period, Rare started selling their games under the trademark name &quot;Rareware&quot;. The company was considered one of Nintendo&#x27;s key developers and had enough recognition that Nintendo offered Rare the Nintendo catalogue of characters to create a 3D CGI game. The Stampers asked for Donkey Kong. The resulting game was &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, which was developed by a total of 20 people and enjoyed an 18-month development cycle. Rare staff also visited Twycross Zoo, observing and videotaping real gorillas. The game was a critical success, with critics praising the game&#x27;s highly advanced visuals and artstyle. &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; sold over nine million copies worldwide, making it the third best-selling game in the SNES library. The game received several Game of the Year honours and was followed by two sequels, &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong&#x27;s Double Trouble!&quot;, as well as several handheld spin-offs such as the &quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot; series.

Nintendo&#x27;s stake purchase allowed Rare to expand significantly. The number of staff members increased from 84 to 250, and Rare moved out from their headquarters at the Manor Farmhouse. Rare also developed a CGI arcade fighting game, &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, on their own custom-built arcade machine. &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; was set to be released for Nintendo&#x27;s own 64-bit system, the Nintendo 64 in 1995, but was forced to release the game for the 16-bit SNES system, and had to downgrade the game&#x27;s graphics. &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; sold 3.2 million copies, and was followed by a sequel, &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot;. &quot;Killer Instinct Gold&quot;, the console version of &quot;Killer Instinct 2&quot;, suffered from a graphical downgrade due to the compression technology used to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo 64 cartridge.

Rare then developed &quot;Blast Corps&quot; for the Nintendo 64. The game sold one million copies, which was considered disappointing by Rare. At that time, Rare was split into several teams, working on different projects. A large-scaled platformer was set to be released afterwards but was delayed. As a result, Rare changed their schedule and released their smaller projects first. The first project was &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, a game based on the &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;. The project was led by Martin Hollis and development was conducted by an inexperienced team. Inspired by Sega&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, &quot;Goldeneye 007&quot; had originally been an on-rails shooter before the team decided to expand the gameplay and turn it into a free-roaming first-person shooter. New elements, such as stealth, headshot mechanics and reloading, were introduced. A split-screen multiplayer was added to the game by the end of its development. &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was the first console first-person shooter developed by Rare and it was released two years after the release of the film. The game received critical praise and received numerous awards. &quot;Goldeneye 007&quot; remained one of the best-selling games for two years, and sold more than eight million units worldwide.

Rare then developed &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, their first self-published game. Originally intended as a real-time strategy game involving cavemen, the game was re-imagined into a racing game prior to its release in 1997. It was one of the fastest selling games at the time, as recorded by The Guinness Book of Records. &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; also features protagonists from some future Rare games, including Banjo and Conker. At the time, Rare was still working on the large-scale platform game. Originally codenamed &quot;Dream: Land of Giants&quot;, it was a game featuring a young boy named Edison and pirates. The protagonist was then replaced by a bear known as Banjo, and Rare expanded the role of Kazooie the bird. The two characters were inspired by characters from Disney films and Rare hoped that they could appeal to a younger audience. &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was released in June 1998 to critical acclaim. A sequel, &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;, was released in 2000. It was a critical success and it outsold the first game, selling 3 million copies.

Upon the completion of &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;″s development, Hollis immediately began another project. Originally set to be a tie-in for &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, Rare was significantly outbid by another publisher, forcing Rare to develop a new concept with new characters. With a major emphasis on lighting, the game was named &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. Hollis left Rare for Nintendo 14 months after the start of &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;″s development. Around the same time, numerous employees left the company and formed new studios. With major project leads departing, a new team took over its development and diminished the role of lighting in the game, making it a more straightforward first-person shooter. The game&#x27;s troubled development did not affect the progress of Rare&#x27;s other teams. When &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; was still in development, Rare released two other games, &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;. In 1999, Nintendo signed an agreement with Disney, and assigned Rare to develop several racing and adventure games featuring Mickey Mouse. The project later became &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Speedway USA&quot; and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Racing Adventure&quot;. &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; eventually resurfaced and it was released in 2000 to critical acclaim. The game sold approximately 2 million copies.

Conker the Squirrel also had his own game, originally named &quot;Conker&#x27;s Quest&quot;. It was later renamed &quot;Twelve Tales: Conker 64&quot;; however, the new game was criticised for being too family-friendly and too similar to &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;. As a result, the team renamed the game &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; and it was re-revealed in 2000. &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;, unlike &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, was intended for a mature audience, and features violence, profanity and scatological humour. The game received positive reviews from critics, but was a commercial failure as the game was released at the end of the Nintendo 64&#x27;s life cycle and was not actively promoted by Nintendo due to its crude content.

After the completion of &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, another team was working on a new game known as &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; for the Nintendo 64. However, Nintendo Senior Managing Director Shigeru Miyamoto suggested the team redesign the game as part of the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series for Nintendo&#x27;s new console, the GameCube. Unlike previous &quot;Star Fox&quot; games, &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; focuses on ground-based, open world exploration. The game received positive reviews upon its launch in 2002. &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; was the only game developed by Rare for the GameCube.

===Microsoft era (2002–present)===
Game development costs gradually increased, and Nintendo did not provide Rare with more capital nor did they purchase the company&#x27;s remaining stake. The Stampers were surprised that Nintendo did not directly acquire the studio. Rare looked for potential buyers. In early 2000, workers from Activision and Microsoft began visiting Rare with purchase offers. According to Microsoft&#x27;s Ed Fries, Nintendo, Activision, and Microsoft then became embroiled in a bidding war for ownership of Rare. Rare expressed interest in Activision&#x27;s offer, but Microsoft offered more money. On 24 September 2002, Microsoft purchased Rare for $375 million (~$ in ). Rare became a first-party developer for Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox. Character trademarks from games developed by Rare for Nintendo consoles, such as Conker of &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; and Banjo of the &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; series, were retained by Rare; intellectual property created by Nintendo, such as &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and &quot;Star Fox&quot;, were retained by Nintendo. This left &quot;Donkey Kong Racing&quot;, due for release for the GameCube, unreleased. 30 employees left Rare during the transition.
Since Microsoft was not part of the handheld video-game console market, Rare continued to develop games for Nintendo handheld consoles after the acquisition. In August 2003, Rare and Microsoft entered an agreement with THQ for THQ to publish Rare&#x27;s games for the Game Boy Advance, including &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;, a game based on an Ultimate character; &quot;Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, initially intended as a Game Boy Color game and &quot;It&#x27;s Mr. Pants!&quot;, a puzzle game originally developed as &quot;Donkey Kong: Coconut Crackers&quot;. January 2005 saw the completion of this deal with the release of &quot;Banjo-Pilot&quot;, known as &quot;Diddy Kong Pilot&quot; before the Microsoft acquisition.

In 2003, Rare released their first Microsoft game, &quot;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&quot;, a humorous action-adventure game set in a haunted mansion full of supernatural creatures. Originally intended as a free-roaming game, it was significantly streamlined in design and concept to attract a larger, more casual audience. The game received mixed reviews from critics, and was considered Rare&#x27;s worst and least-popular game. At E3 2004, Microsoft&#x27;s Ken Lobb said that Rare had obtained Nintendo DS development kits and was working on two games for the Nintendo DS. Shortly afterwards, Microsoft issued a statement that the company and its studios had no plans for Nintendo DS development. However, in July 2005, Rare posted job openings for Nintendo DS development on its website and said that it was creating &quot;key&quot; DS games. Only two were ever released, with the first one being &quot;Diddy Kong Racing DS&quot;, a remake of the Nintendo 64 title &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; which was released in February 2007, and the second being &quot;Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise&quot;, a life simulation game, released in September 2008.

Rare released &quot;&quot;, a remake of &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;, in 2005 with updated graphics and a reworked multiplayer option. The game received generally favourable reviews but, similar to &quot;Bad Fur Day&quot;, was a commercial failure. Xbox successor Xbox 360 was released in 2005, and two of its launch games were developed by Rare: &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; and &quot;&quot;. &quot;Zero&quot;, a prequel to the first &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, was originally intended for GameCube before its redesign as an Xbox 360 game. Rare removed several features to meet the game&#x27;s release deadline in 2005. &quot;Kameo: Elements of Power&quot; was also intended for the GameCube. A new intellectual property, in it the player character shape-shifts to solve puzzles. Although both received generally positive reviews from critics and sold more than a million copies, they were considered disappointments.

In 2006, the company released &quot;Viva Piñata&quot;, a game involving gardening. Incorporating elements of several franchises including &quot;The Sims&quot;, &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, and &quot;Harvest Moon&quot;, it was acclaimed as innovative. The game&#x27;s commercial performance was a disappointment, however, and some Rare team members questioned Microsoft Studios&#x27; large marketing budget for &quot;Gears of War&quot; and its relative neglect of &quot;Viva Piñata&quot;. On 2 January 2007, Rare founders Chris and Tim Stamper left the company to &quot;pursue other opportunities&quot;. Former lead designer Gregg Mayles became Rare&#x27;s creative director and Mark Betteridge the company&#x27;s studio director. That year saw the release of &quot;Jetpac Refuelled&quot;, a remake of &quot;Jetpac&quot; for Xbox Live Arcade.
Rare unveiled work on Xbox Live avatars, &quot;Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise&quot; (the next game in the &quot;Viva Piñata &quot; series), and &quot;Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts&quot; in 2008. Made by the core team that developed the first &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, &quot;Nuts &amp; Bolts&quot; received significant criticism from players due to its focus on vehicle construction rather than traditional platforming. Though generally receiving positive reviews, the company&#x27;s games for Microsoft sold poorly and Microsoft decided to restructure the studio at the end of the decade. In March 2010, Rare opened a new facility at Fazeley Studios in Digbeth, Birmingham. Later that year, Microsoft confirmed that Scott Henson, a developer who had worked on the hardware and software designs of the Xbox 360 console and Kinect for Xbox 360, replaced Mark Betteridge as studio manager and announced a focus on Xbox Live avatars. Rare also shifted their focus to Kinect. According to Henson, &quot;Kinect will be the main focus for Rare going forwards as it&#x27;s a very rich canvas. This is just the beginning of an experience that will touch millions of people&quot;. Rare&#x27;s first Kinect project, &quot;Kinect Sports&quot;, was released in November 2010. Originally titled &quot;Sports Star&quot;, a more-complex sports simulation game, the game was streamlined into what Microsoft executive Don Mattrick hoped would be the Kinect equivalent of &quot;Wii Sports&quot;. According to a former Rare employee, the team was worried about the game during its development because of Kinect&#x27;s limitations. Its reviews were average, but it was a commercial success, selling three million units by May 2011. Rare and BigPark, another Microsoft studio, collaborated on the development of a sequel, &quot;Kinect Sports: Season Two&quot;.

In March 2011, Scott Henson announced that Craig Duncan, who had worked on &quot;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing&quot; and the &quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot; series, was hired as senior studio director. Simon Woodroffe, who had worked at several studios (including Adventure Soft, Midway Games, Ubisoft, and Sega), became the studio&#x27;s creative director in April 2012. A Rare property, &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, was revived in 2013. The company had a supporting role in its development, assisting lead developer Double Helix Games. Another Rare mascot, Conker, was also featured in another Microsoft game, &quot;Project Spark&quot; as episodic downloadable content. Known as &quot;Conker&#x27;s Big Reunion&quot;, it was cancelled in 2015.
Rare released &quot;Kinect Sports Rivals&quot; in 2014. The game was worked on by 150 staff members and a new game engine was developed for it. The game was a commercial failure and following Microsoft&#x27;s announcement that Kinect would no longer be a priority, about 15 Rare employees were laid off. On 10 February 2015, a group of former Rare employees announced the formation of a new studio, Playtonic Games, and planned a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to the &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; franchise titled &quot;Yooka-Laylee&quot;, which was released on 11 April 2017 with mixed reviews. According to Rare composer Robin Beanland, the year 2015 would be significant for the company. At E3 2015, a new compilation game, &quot;Rare Replay&quot; celebrating the studio&#x27;s 30th anniversary, was introduced; it was released in August. The compilation&#x27;s thirty titles only included games to which Rare owned the intellectual property. Because of this, Rare&#x27;s operations director Drew Quakenbush noted it was the reason &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;&#x27;s absence from the compilation. &quot;Rare Replay&quot; became the most pre-ordered game shown at E3 that year and received critical acclaim upon launch. A new game, &quot;Sea of Thieves&quot;, a multiplayer adventure game marketed as &quot;The Best Game That Rare Has Ever Made&quot;, was introduced at E3 that year. It was delayed at the following year&#x27;s conference and was released on 20 March 2018. The game received mixed reviews, but was a commercial success; in January 2020, Microsoft declared it the most successful IP it released in the eighth generation, with more than 10 million players. The game was also released on the PlayStation 5, marking it as Rare&#x27;s first product on a PlayStation console.

Since 2018, Rare has been working with Dlala Studios on a &quot;Battletoads&quot; revival for the Xbox One and Windows, which was eventually released in 2020. Rare would also reconnect with Nintendo in 2019 through the addition of Banjo &amp; Kazooie as playable characters in the crossover fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; for the Nintendo Switch as well as re-releases of their games on Nintendo Switch Online. At the X019 event in November 2019, Rare announced it was developing &quot;Everwild&quot;, an action-adventure game for Windows and Xbox Series X/S. As of January 2020, Rare had more than 200 employees, after growing at a consistent pace for five years. On October 14, 2024, Microsoft announced that Duncan will be promoted to head of Xbox Game Studios in November to succeed the outgoing Alan Hartman, with Joe Neate and Jim Horth to succeed him as studio heads.

==Culture==
According to Mark Betteridge, one of Rare&#x27;s main goals is to create games people will find enjoyable rather than just to earn profit. The Stamper brothers gave the team considerable creative freedom, although they would intervene if a product was technically flawed or under-performing. Some employees noted that working for Rare in its early days could be difficult, with staff members allowed 30 minutes for lunch and possibly working more than 60 hours a week. Nintendo worked closely with Rare, and their relationship was described as a &quot;creative partnership&quot; by &quot;Viva Piñata&quot; designer Justin Cook. According to Hansen in 2010, innovation is very important to the company, thus they focus on trying out new technology, such as Xbox 360&#x27;s Kinect. Historically the company has developed only for video game consoles, never for personal computers, with the Stamper brothers citing a preference for working on a stable standard format which is specifically designed for playing games. According to Duncan in 2014, Rare would only develop games that had unique ideas, and will never develop a generic game with their intellectual properties.

Ed Fries, head of Microsoft Studios&#x27; publishing division at the time of acquisition, said that the company attempted to preserve Rare&#x27;s culture so its staff could continue feeling that they worked for Rare rather than Microsoft. Rare employees differed about working conditions after the Microsoft acquisition. According to &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; lead engineer Phil Tossell, conditions became more stressful after an &quot;imperceptible&quot; start, and the culture of the two companies began clashing. Tossell said that Microsoft gradually imposed a corporate structure on Rare, including more performance reviews and meetings, to which some Rare members found difficulty in adapting. Some admitted that early changes, such as permitting team members to discuss projects they were not working on and allowing staff members to use the Internet or listen to music during work hours, were beneficial to team morale. Betteridge called the overall change &quot;positive&quot;, saying that Microsoft&#x27;s capital could help Rare develop their projects. Former Rare employee Gavin Price said that some Microsoft executives, such as Phil Spencer, were supportive of the developer. Grant Kirkhope, a former composer at Rare, strongly criticised Microsoft following the acquisition. Former Xbox executive Peter Moore voiced his disappointment with Rare&#x27;s works after the acquisition. He noted that Rare employees were attempting to &quot;recreate the glory years&quot;, but their skills had become outdated and were no longer &quot;applicable in today&#x27;s market&quot;. Duncan insisted that there were still a lot of talented people working at Rare, and they will have a &quot;bright future&quot;.

Unlike other software developers, Rare acquired a reputation for secrecy; the approach to their office buildings, in Manor Park near Twycross, was monitored by cameras. The company was internally divided into different barns where employees worked exclusively on their group&#x27;s game. According to Tim Stamper,

Though normally secretive, Rare allowed several exclusive tours of its studio by fansites Rarenet in 1999, Rare-Extreme in 2004 and again in 2009, as well as by the website &quot;Eurogamer&quot; in 2006. In 2010, Rare declined an offer by fansite MundoRare to film a documentary about their studios at MundoRare&#x27;s expense. The film, to celebrate Rare&#x27;s 25th anniversary, would have been distributed on the internet and Xbox Live. Rare refused permission to shoot the film, saying that it was not &quot;on message&quot;. MundoRare was shut down, and stated that the site could not support the company&#x27;s new corporate direction. Rare&#x27;s secrecy was criticised by &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot;″s Alex Carlson, as they thought that it made them &quot;disconnected&quot;, and prompted them to develop games that &quot;their fans don&#x27;t want&quot;. When Duncan took over as the studio&#x27;s head, he intended to change the culture of the studio. Rare&#x27;s office was completely remodeled so as to facilitate idea sharing between team members. The studio also adopted a more open attitude to its community, with the studio inviting fans to take part in the development project of their latest game &quot;Sea of Thieves&quot;.

Around 1997, a number of Rare employees left to establish separate companies. The first was Eighth Wonder, underwritten by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which did not produce any games before it closed. After Martin Hollis left Rare, he joined Nintendo before founding his own company Zoonami, releasing &quot;Zendoku&quot;, &quot;Go! Puzzle&quot; and &quot;Bonsai Barber&quot;. 

Several &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; team members, including David Doak and Steve Ellis, founded Free Radical Design and created the &quot;TimeSplitters&quot; series. The studio would be acquired by Crytek and renamed Crytek UK before its 2014 closure, with most of its staff moving to Deep Silver Dambuster Studios. Deep Silver briefly reestablished Free Radical Design from 2021 to 2023, with original founding members Steve Ellis and David Doak heading up the studio. Other former Free Radical and Rare staff formed Crash Labs, a studio specialising in developing iOS games. 

Chris Seavor, director of &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;, founded the Gory Detail studio along with Rare employee Shawn Pile. They released &quot;Parashoot Stan&quot; for mobile devices, as well as &quot;The Unlikely Legend of Rusty Pup&quot; on Steam. Starfire Studios were founded by four former Rare employees and released &quot;Fusion Genesis&quot;, an Xbox Live Arcade game published by Microsoft Game Studios. Another group of former Rare employees formed a mobile-game studio, Flippin Pixels. Former Rare employee Lee Schuneman headed Lift London, a Microsoft studio. Phil Tossell and Jennifer Schneidereit founded Nyamyam and released &quot;Tengami&quot;. 

Playtonic Games was founded by several former Rare employees in 2014. They are best known for the &quot;Yooka-Laylee&quot; series, with the first game being a spiritual successor to &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;. Rare founders Chris and Tim Stamper joined FortuneFish, a mobile game company founded by Tim&#x27;s son, Joe Stamper. Their first game is &quot;That Bouncy Thing! The Rubbishiest Game Ever&quot; for Android.

==Games==
Rare has developed a number of video games since its founding, with sales nearing 90 million copies by 2002. The company is best known for its platform games, which include the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, and &quot;Conker&quot; series, and for its Nintendo 64 first-person shooters &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. Rare does not adhere to a few specific video-game genres. They have also developed action-adventure games, including &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; and &quot;&quot;; fighting games, such as the &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; series; racing games, such as &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot; and &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, and beat &#x27;em up-shoot &#x27;em up games such as &quot;Battletoads&quot; and &quot;Captain Skyhawk&quot;. Since Rare has usually been associated with a video-game console manufacturer (such as Nintendo and Microsoft), most of their games have been developed as exclusives for a particular platform. In 2018, Rare released &quot;Sea of Thieves&quot;, a pirate-themed open world sandbox game for Xbox One and Windows 10. At Microsoft&#x27;s X019 event, a fantasy action-adventure title called &quot;Everwild&quot; was announced.

The company&#x27;s cancelled projects include &quot;&quot;, which became &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;; &quot;Perfect Dark Core&quot;, originally the sequel to the first &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;; &quot;Black Widow&quot;, an open world game that tasks players to control an eight-legged robot; &quot;Sundown&quot;, which featured a horde-like survival mode; &quot;The Fast and the Furriest&quot;, a mascot racer; &quot;Tailwind&quot;, an action game featuring helicopters; &quot;Urchin&quot;, a &quot;Fable&quot;-style game which began development after the completion of &quot;Live &amp; Reloaded&quot;; &quot;Ordinary Joe&quot;; &quot;Savannah&quot;, a Kinect-based game; Kinect equivalents of &quot;Wii Fit&quot; and &quot;Professor Layton&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, and a sequel to &quot;Kameo: Elements of Power&quot;.

==Awards==
Rare received numerous awards, including BAFTA award for &quot;Best UK Developer&quot; for its work on &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;. In 1997, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; named Rare &quot;Most Promising Game Company&quot;, citing their high rate of success in putting out killer apps for the Nintendo 64. Rare was awarded the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Moving Images Award in 2000 for developing &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. Tim and Chris Stamper were named as Development Legends in the 2015 &quot;Develop&quot; Industry Excellence Awards. Rare was included as Gamasutra&#x27;s Top 30 Developers of All Time, and was ranked as the 36th best video game maker by IGN. The Herbert Art Gallery and Museum curated a retrospective of the company&#x27;s work in 2018.

<text>Khakassia (), officially the Republic of Khakassia, is a republic of Russia located in southern Siberia. It is situated between Krasnoyarsk Krai to the north and the Altai Republic to the south.

The capital city of Khakassia is Abakan, and the region covers an area of about . The population of Khakassia is approximately 537,000 people, with the majority of the population living in urban areas.

The region is known for its natural beauty, with numerous rivers, lakes, and mountains. The Khakassky Nature Reserve is located in the region, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including brown bears, wolves, and sable. The region is also known for its traditional crafts, such as woodworking and embroidery, and for its traditional festivals and celebrations.

== Geography ==
The republic is located in the southwestern part of Eastern Siberia and borders Krasnoyarsk Krai in the north and east, the Tuva Republic in the southeast and south, the Altai Republic in the south and southwest, and Kemerovo Oblast in the west and northwest. It stretches for from north to south and for from east to west. Mountains (eastern slopes of Kuznetsk Alatau and the Abakan Range) cover two-thirds of the republic&#x27;s territory and serve as the natural boundaries of the republic. The highest point is Kyzlasov Peak. The remaining territory is flat, with the Minusinsk Hollow being the most prominent feature. The Yenisei is the largest river in the republic. Other significant rivers include the Abakan, Tom’, Bely Iyus, Black Iyus, and the Chulym (between the Yenisei and the eastern mountains), with all except the Abakan part of the Ob river basin. There are over three hundred lakes in the republic, both salt- and fresh-water. The climate is continental, with the average annual temperature of . Natural resources are abundant and include iron, gold, silver, coal, oil, and natural gas. Molybdenum deposits are the largest in Russia. Forests cover the south and the west of the republic.

== History ==
The territory of modern Khakassia formed the core of the Yenisei Kirghiz state from the 6th century AD In the 13th century, following defeat by the Mongols, the majority of the Kyrgyz people migrated southwest to Central Asia to the area of present-day Kyrgyzstan. Modern Khakas people regard themselves as the descendants of those Kyrgyz who remained in Siberia. Khakassia was incorporated into the Russian state under Peter the Great ().
This incorporation was confirmed in a treaty—the —between Russia and China in 1729. As it was common to deport convicted criminals from European Russia to Siberia, forts were quickly constructed in Khakassia (1707 and 1718). Many prisoners remained even after release. Many of the indigenous Khakas people converted to the Russian Orthodox faith and gradually abandoned their nomadic way of life.

By the time of the 1917 Russian Revolution, Russians made up approximately half of the population. Under Soviet rule, autonomy was granted on 20 October 1930, when the Khakas Autonomous Oblast was established. The borders of the autonomous oblast are the same as the borders of the modern Khakas Republic.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the Soviet authorities resettled an estimated quarter of a million Russians in the region. These were followed by 10,000 Volga Germans deported during World War II. By the time of the 1959 Census, ethnic Khakas people represented little more than 10% of the population of the Khakas oblast.

Until 1991, the Khakas Autonomous Oblast was administratively subordinated to Krasnoyarsk Krai. In July 1991, it was elevated in status to that of a Soviet socialist republic within the Russian Federation, and in February 1992 it became the Republic of Khakassia.

== Administrative divisions ==

==Politics==
The highest legal act of the region is the Constitution of the Republic of Khakassia. It was adopted on 25 May 1995 by the Supreme Council of the Republic.

The term of office is 5 years. Since 15 November 2018, this post has been occupied by Valentin Konovalov (Communist Party of the Russian Federation).

Legislative power in Khakassia is exercised by the unicameral Supreme Council of the Republic of Khakassia, consisting of 50 deputies elected by a mixed electoral system: 25 by party lists and 25 by single-member districts. The United Russia faction makes up an absolute majority in the region&#x27;s parliament (35 seats, 70%). The Chairman of the Supreme Council of the current VII convocation, elected in 2018, is Vladimir Shtygashev.

In the Federation Council, the region is represented by a member of the CPRF, Senator Valery Usatyuk, from the executive branch (since November 2018) and a member of United Russia, Senator Alexander Zhukov, from the legislative branch (since March 2019).

<text>Disintermediation is the removal of intermediaries in economics from a supply chain, or &quot;cutting out the middlemen&quot; in connection with a transaction or a series of transactions. Instead of going through traditional distribution channels, which had some type of intermediary (such as a distributor, wholesaler, broker, or agent), companies may now deal with customers directly, for example via the Internet.

Disintermediation may decrease the total cost of servicing customers and may allow the manufacturer to increase profit margins and/or reduce prices. Disintermediation initiated by consumers is often the result of high market transparency, in that buyers are aware of supply prices direct from the manufacturer. Buyers may choose to bypass the middlemen (wholesalers and retailers) to buy directly from the manufacturer, and pay less. Buyers can alternatively elect to purchase from wholesalers. Often, a business-to-consumer electronic commerce (B2C) company functions as the bridge between buyer and manufacturer.

However manufacturers will still incur distribution costs, such as the physical transport of goods, packaging in small units, advertising, and customer helplines, some or all of which would previously have been borne by the intermediary. To illustrate, a typical B2C supply chain is composed of four or five entities. These are the supplier, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer and buyer.

==History==

The term was originally applied to the banking industry in 1967; disintermediation occurred when consumers avoided the intermediation of banks by investing directly in securities (government and private bonds, insurance companies, hedge funds, mutual funds and stocks) rather than leaving their money in savings accounts. The original cause was a U.S. government regulation (Regulation Q) which limited the interest rate paid on interest bearing accounts that were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

It was later applied more generally to &quot;cutting out the middleman&quot; in commerce, though the financial meaning remained predominant. Only in the late 1990s did it become widely popularized.

==Impact of Internet-related disintermediation upon various industries==
It has been argued that the Internet modifies the supply chain due to market transparency. Disintermediation has acquired a new meaning with the advent of the virtual marketplace. The virtual marketplace sellers like Amazon are edging out the middlemen. Direct sellers and buyers connect with each other because of the platform created by the virtual marketplace vendor. There is quid pro quo for the vendor for the use of the platform, else it would make no business sense to create such a platform. If the buyer, having connected with the seller, circumvents the platform and talks to the seller and does her deal directly with the seller, then the platform owner is unlikely to get her revenue share. This may be considered a new form of disintermediation.

===Discussion===
In the non-Internet world, disintermediation has been an important strategy for many big box retailers like Walmart, which attempt to reduce prices by reducing the number of intermediaries between the supplier and the buyer. Disintermediation is also closely associated with the idea of just in time manufacturing, as the removal of the need for inventory removes one function of an intermediary. The existence of laws which discourage disintermediation has been cited as a reason for the poor economic performance of Japan and Germany in the 1990s.

However, Internet-related disintermediation occurred less frequently than many expected during the dot com boom. Retailers and wholesalers provide essential functions such as the extension of credit, aggregation of products from different suppliers, and processing of returns. In addition, shipping goods to and from the manufacturer can in many cases be far less efficient than shipping them to a store where the consumer can pick them up (if the consumer&#x27;s trip to the store is ignored). In response to the threat of disintermediation, some retailers have attempted to integrate a virtual presence and a physical presence in a strategy known as bricks and clicks.

==Reintermediation==

Reintermediation can be defined as the reintroduction of an intermediary between end users (consumers) and a producer. This term applies especially to instances in which disintermediation has occurred first.

At the start of the Internet revolution, electronic commerce was seen as a tool of disintermediation for cutting operating costs. The concept was that by allowing consumers to purchase products directly from producers via the Internet, the product delivery chain would be drastically shortened, thereby &quot;disintermediating&quot; the standard supply model middlemen. However, what largely happened was that new intermediaries appeared in the digital landscape (e.g., Amazon.com and eBay).

Reintermediation occurred due to many new problems associated with the e-commerce disintermediation concept, largely centered on the issues associated with the direct-to-consumers model. The high cost of shipping many small orders, massive customer service issues, and confronting the wrath of disintermediated retailers and supply channel partners all presented real obstacles. Huge resources are required to accommodate presales and postsales issues of individual consumers. Before disintermediation, supply chain middlemen acted as salespeople for the producers. Without them, the producer itself would have to handle procuring those customers. Selling online has its own associated costs: developing quality websites, maintaining product information, and marketing expenses all add up. Finally, limiting a product&#x27;s availability to Internet channels forces the producer to compete with the rest of the Internet for customers&#x27; attention, a space that is becoming increasingly crowded.

==Examples==
Notable examples of disintermediation include Dell and Apple, which sell many of their systems direct-to-consumer—thus bypassing traditional retail chains, having succeeded in creating brands well recognized by customers, profitable and with continuous growth.

=== In the automotive industry ===
Tesla avoids using dealers as middlemen by offering their own outlets, which have only a few vehicles for display and test driving; customers complete their full purchase online. This approach allowed Tesla to raise auto gross profit by about 34%. This strategy also allows Tesla to control more of its customers&#x27; experience and build online community. Following Tesla&#x27;s success, two other automotive brands, Audi and General Motors, decided to start trials of direct sales in 2012 and 2013 respectively.

<text>CSS &quot;Arkansas&quot; was the lead ship of her class of two casemate ironclads built for the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War. Completed in 1862, she saw combat in the Western Theater when she steamed through a United States Navy fleet at Vicksburg in July. &quot;Arkansas&quot; was set on fire and destroyed by her crew after her engines broke down several weeks later. Her remains lie under a levee above Baton Rouge, Louisiana at .

==Design and description==

At the outset of the American Civil War, the Confederate States of America had a lack of warships. Seeking to offset the Union&#x27;s advantage in numbers through technology, Stephen R. Mallory, the Confederate States Secretary of the Navy, decided to build ironclad warships. An experienced steamboat man from Memphis, Tennessee, named John T. Shirley visited Mallory in mid-August 1861 and offered to build a pair of such ships to defend the middle portion of the Mississippi River. Acutely aware of the lack of Confederate naval facilities in the region able to build ironclads, Mallory and Shirley signed a contract for two ships, &quot;Arkansas&quot; and her sister ship CSS &quot;Tennessee&quot;, at $76,920 each on August 24. Neither Shirley nor his master builder Primus Emerson owned a facility suitable for building a ship, and none were available for use in Memphis. The pair ultimately settled on a riverfront site below the bluff on which Fort Pickering sat on the southern edge of Memphis where &quot;Arkansas&quot; was laid down in October 1861.

Shirley consulted with naval architect John L. Porter and gun designer John M. Brooke during his trip and their views greatly influenced the design. Unlike virtually every other Confederate ironclad, the &quot;Arkansas&quot;-class ships were built with a traditional keeled-hull design with vertical sides to their casemates, probably to improve their seakeeping abilities in the Gulf of Mexico. The ships measured between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a depth of hold of . As designed they would have displaced about and had a draft of . They were equipped with a pair of horizontal, direct-acting steam engines, each driving one propeller using steam provided by four coal-burning, high-pressure boilers, although two additional boilers were added to &quot;Arkansas&quot; while she was under construction. The ship had a maximum speed of in still water, but mechanical problems reduced that speed considerably in service. The boiler combustion gases exhausted through a single funnel in diameter made from thin iron plates. Although the amount of coal storage aboard the ships is unknown, &quot;Arkansas&quot; demonstrated a range in excess of during her brief career.

The &quot;Arkansas&quot;-class ships were equipped with a pointed cast-iron ram that was bolted to their bows at or just below the waterline. They were designed to mount four guns, two on each broadside, but &quot;Arkansas&quot; was modified while under construction to accommodate 10 guns, three on each broadside and two each on the fore and aft faces of the casemate. Sources differ as to the exact numbers of each type, but the ship was armed with two 64-pounder Columbiads in the front face of the casemate and a pair of 32-pounder smoothbore guns converted to be rifled cannons in the aft face while the broadside armament consisted of two Dahlgren guns and four 32-pounders of which at least two had been rifled, according to naval historian Myron J. Smith. The side gun ports allowed the guns there to traverse somewhat, but the oval gun ports on the fore and aft faces of the casemate were very narrow which badly restricted those guns&#x27; ability to traverse and severely limited the ability of the gun crews to see their targets.

The vertical sides of the sisters&#x27; casemates were constructed from oak logs thick while the fore and aft faces of the casemate sloped at a 35° angle from the horizontal and were built from oak squares to which were nailed oak planks inches thick. Behind the sides of the casemate was a layer of compressed cotton, possibly deep, backed by a wooden bulkhead between each gun port. &quot;Arkansas&quot; was intended to be armored with rolled iron plates, but the only delivery of such plates was diverted to the ironclad which was much further along in construction. Instead &quot;Arkansas&quot; used railroad T-shaped-rails, possibly deep, alternating top and bottom to present a relatively smooth surface. The pilothouse protruded above the top of the casemate and was protected by two layers of bar iron. The visibility of the pilot was badly restricted by the narrow slits cut in the sides of the pilothouse. The casemate roof was minimally protected by of wrought iron boiler plate and the deck fore and aft of the casemate was unarmored. A shortage of rails meant that the stern face of the casemate was only protected by boiler plates. The broadside gun ports were protected by hinged iron shutters divided into upper and lower halves, but the fore and aft gun ports were fitted with iron collars into which the gun fit when firing. Captain William F. Lynch, commander of Confederate naval forces in the region, described &quot;Arkansas&quot; as inferior to the ironclad and criticized the quality and construction of the ship&#x27;s armor and smokestack.

==Construction==
Despite his initial support for the Memphis ironclads, Major General Leonidas Polk, the Confederate regional commander, generally refused to release any skilled workmen from his command to assist in their construction; shortly after the ships were laid down, Shirley petitioned Polk for 100 carpenters, but only received 8. Other petitions for manpower were ignored, greatly slowing progress on the ships, as Polk gave priority to his newly formed flotilla of ships on the Tennessee River, all of which except &quot;Eastport&quot; were unarmored. Material shortages also slowed construction and Shirley chose to focus his efforts on completing &quot;Arkansas&quot;.

Union ships captured the incomplete &quot;Eastport&quot; and the lumber and armor plates already delivered, but not yet installed, on February 7, 1862, after the surrender of Fort Henry gave the Federals command of the Tennessee the previous day and towed her way to be completed in a Union shipyard. The beginning of the siege of Island Number Ten north of Memphis in early March threatened the city and alerted Confederate commanders and officials to the lack of progress on the &quot;Arkansas&quot;-class ironclads. Prompted by the request of Secretary of War, Judah P. Benjamin, Major General P. G. T. Beauregard sent an officer to inspect the sisters and evaluate how much progress had been made in mid-March. He reported that &quot;Arkansas&quot; was well advanced, but that &quot;Tennessee&quot; would need six more weeks to before she could be launched. About this time Mallory sent Commander Charles H. McBlair to expedite the ships&#x27; construction and appointed him as captain of &quot;Arkansas&quot;.

The ironclad was apparently launched in early April, although other sources state later in the month. At this time, the exterior of her hull had been covered in iron down to below the waterline and the casemate had been built although gun ports had not yet been cut. The engines and boilers were aboard, but not yet installed, and the propellers and their shafts had been mounted. Only four guns were available, but McBlair had not yet decided where to mount them. The surrender of Island Number Ten on April 8 left only Fort Pillow between Memphis and the advancing Union forces. Three days later Mallory ordered McBlair to take the &quot;Arkansas&quot; for completion &quot;if she is in danger at Memphis&quot;. McBlair hired the side-wheel steamer &quot;Capitol&quot; to tow the ironclad if necessary and quartered much of her crew aboard after her arrival on April 19.

On April 25, the same day that the Union captured New Orleans, McBlair commissioned &quot;Arkansas&quot; and prepared to transfer his ship to Yazoo City, Mississippi, for completion. One or two days later, the ironclad, as well as a barge containing additional materials, were towed by the &quot;Capitol&quot; to the mouth of the Yazoo River and thence up that river to Yazoo City. The ships left the city on May 7 for Greenwood, Mississippi, which was further upriver, after being warned by Mississippi governor John J. Pettus that Union ships were coming up the Mississippi River, possibly hunting for &quot;Arkansas&quot;. The two ships reached Greenwood on May 10, just as the annual spring rise of the river was beginning. Several levees broke and the consequent flooding put the uncompleted &quot;Arkansas&quot; almost from shore. To further complicate things, the barge that had accompanied the ship from Memphis also sank during this time, and vital machinery and material had to be recovered from the river bottom using a diving bell. Progress on the ironclad advanced at a snail&#x27;s pace during these difficulties.

On May 19, Beauregard inquired about &quot;Arkansas&quot;″s status and, displeased by the lack of progress, telegraphed Mallory, requesting new leadership for the ironclad. Three days later Mallory appointed Lieutenant Isaac N. Brown captain of &quot;Arkansas&quot;, ordering him to complete her &quot;without regard to the expenditure of men or money.&quot; Mallory ordered McBlair back to Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital, on the 24th. Brown received his orders on 26 May and reached Greenwood three days later. He was disappointed to find the ship much less advanced than he had hoped and found only five carpenters at work and one blacksmith&#x27;s forge in use. Dismayed by his predecessor&#x27;s lack of energy and failure to discipline his workforce, Brown requested some workmen from local Confederate Army units and persuaded several local men to join the crew and slave owners to loan some of their slaves to work on the ship that same day. Brown had &quot;Arkansas&quot; towed back to Yazoo City lest she run aground as the flooding subsided and to utilize the greater resources and manpower available there. He jailed some of the troublemakers among the workmen to reestablish discipline and ordered McBlair off the ship at gunpoint, tired of the senior man&#x27;s interference.

Brown&#x27;s appeal for more workers at Yazoo City drew a larger response than he had anticipated, with men volunteering to work on the ship and slave owners volunteering both their field hands and skilled workmen. Brown took advantage of the additional labor by working his men around the clock, every day of the week. Blacksmithing tools were borrowed from local plantation owners and 14 forges were operated at the site to make iron fixtures and machinery parts. With the armor-drilling machinery lost when the barge sank, a makeshift crane was set up on &quot;Capitol&quot; to hold the newly fabricated drill which was powered by a leather belt driven by the steamboat&#x27;s hoisting engine. Within five weeks, &quot;Arkansas&quot; had been mostly completed, although the iron plating on her stern and pilothouse was not yet finished. However, river levels were falling, and further construction was no longer practical. Boiler plate was added to the stern, which was viewed to be less likely to be exposed to enemy fire. Brown described the additional boiler plate as being &quot;for appearance&#x27;s sake&quot;.

The ironclad departed for Liverpool Landing, Mississippi, on either June 22 or 23, to rendezvous with Confederate forces defending the Yazoo River further downstream. A log raft had been constructed there across the Yazoo to serve as a barricade, and three Confederate gunboats were positioned to defend it. While she reached a top speed of eight miles per hour, the voyage revealed the ventilation for the engine room and casemate was grossly inadequate, especially since the boilers were uninsulated. The mechanical weakness of her engines was also demonstrated as they tended to hang up at top dead center, forcing the crew to use pry bars to manually move the pistons to another position to restart the engine. The engines were linked by a &#x27;stopper&#x27; that was supposed to stop one engine if the other stopped for any reason, but this never worked and &quot;Arkansas&quot; would start to turn in a circle as the working engine overpowered the turning force provided by the rudder.

==Career==
===Action on the Yazoo===
By this time, a Union Navy fleet commanded by Flag Officer Charles H. Davis, had captured Memphis and occupied the Mississippi River north of Vicksburg, Mississippi, threatening the city. Two unarmed Union ships approached Liverpool Landing on 26 June, causing Commander Robert Pinckney to order his gunboats burned. The Union ships returned to the Mississippi River and &quot;Arkansas&quot; arrived at the scene after they had left. Brown ordered his crew to try to put out the flames, but they were unsuccessful. Although nothing could be salvaged from the gunboats, quantities of supplies and material, including cannon, had been off-loaded earlier. Two days later Commodore David G. Farragut passed the defenses of Vicksburg to unite with Davis&#x27; ships north of the city.

Brown briefly returned to Yazoo City to test his engines, but otherwise remained at Liverpool Landing trying to fix the engines, finishing outfitting the ironclad, and integrating the crews of the destroyed gunboats into his own crew. As his ship became more combat worthy, Brown sent Lieutenant Charles Read to Vicksburg on July 8 to find out what the Confederate commander of the area, Major General Earl Van Dorn, wanted him to do and to scout out the Union fleet between him and the city. Van Dorn ordered him to sortie into the Mississippi to attack the Union ships north of the city and then to proceed south of Vicksburg and destroy the mortar boats there if the condition of his ship allowed him to do so. Around 11 July 60 Missouri artillerymen who had volunteered to serve aboard &quot;Arkansas&quot; en route to Vicksburg arrived and were given a crash course in operating heavy artillery.
A passage was cut through the raft barrier at Liverpool Landing on July 12, and &quot;Arkansas&quot; continued downriver to Satartia, Mississippi, accompanied by the tugboat . Brown spent all day there on the 13th, exercising his gun crews. Problems occurred on July 14, when the gunpowder in the forward magazine was discovered to have been dampened by steam escaping from her engines. &quot;Arkansas&quot; had to stop at the riverbank for her crew to allow the powder to dry in the sun. Brown reloaded the dry powder later that day and continued to Haynes Bluff, where he anchored about midnight, intending to surprised the Union ships in the Mississippi at dawn.
Farragut had been alerted by Confederate deserters that &quot;Arkansas&quot; was on the Yazoo, although the latest Union intelligence was that she was still incomplete and upriver from Liverpool Landing. Nonetheless, Farragut and Davis agreed to send a reconnaissance mission up the Yazoo to search for the ironclad, consisting of the timberclad gunboat , the ram , and the ironclad . Leaving &quot;St. Mary&quot; behind, Brown departed his anchorage about 03:00 and spotted the Union ships about three hours later a few miles from the mouth of the Yazoo. Brown ordered his pilots to steer for the &quot;Carondelet&quot;, intending to ram the Union ship, about astern of &quot;Tyler&quot; and &quot;Queen of the West&quot;. He only authorized his forward guns to fire if they bore directly on a target as he did not want to be slowed down by the cannons&#x27; recoil. &quot;Tyler&quot; drew the first blood of the engagement when a Confederate soldier was decapitated by a projectile while leaning out of a gun port. The two unarmored ships reversed course to fall back on &quot;Carondelet&quot;, but &quot;Arkansas&quot; was able to close within a range of from &quot;Tyler&quot;. A shell from one of her Columbiads detonated inside &quot;Tyler&quot;″s engine room, killing 9 men and wounding 16, but the gun recoiled off its mount and it took 10 minutes of hard labor to remount the gun. Although &quot;Queen of the West&quot; was not armed, she attempted to maneuver into a position from which she could ram the Confederate ship, but was dissuaded by a broadside from &quot;Arkansas&quot;, and turned downstream.

&quot;Tyler&quot; followed shortly afterward, continuing to engage the ironclad with her single 30-pounder Parrott rifle stern chaser from a range of . As &quot;Carondelet&quot; and &quot;Arkansas&quot; closed the range, the former&#x27;s shells bounced off the Confederate ship&#x27;s armor while the latter&#x27;s shells began to penetrate the Union ironclad&#x27;s thinner frontal armor. Commander Henry A. Walke, &quot;Carondelet&quot;&#x27;s captain, then ordered his ship to reverse course so that the &quot;Arkansas&quot; could not ram him, even though the maneuver exposed his unarmored stern with its pair of 32-pounder smoothbore stern chasers. &quot;Arkansas&quot; was able to close within of the retreating Union ironclad, but could not get any closer. Within a half hour after the start of the battle, &quot;Carondelet&quot;″s armor had been pierced by at least eight 64-pounder shells, although one of &quot;Tyler&quot;″s shots had struck her pilothouse, wounding both pilots familiar with the Yazoo river. Around this time the sharpshooters aboard &quot;Tyler&quot; opened fire, shooting at &quot;Arkansas&quot;″s smokestack, gun ports and Brown himself, who had been commanding his ship from the top of the casemate. One Minié ball grazed his head as he was about to descend into the casemate, but only temporarily knocked him unconscious. &quot;Arkansas&quot;″s fire had cut &quot;Carondelet&quot;″s steering ropes and she ran aground in a bend of the river. Brown ordered a broadside fired into the Union ship as &quot;Arkansas&quot; passed by at point-blank range, intent on reaching the Mississippi. By this time &quot;Arkansas&quot;″s smokestack had been riddled with holes by Union fire and the weakened draft for the boilers had gradually reduced their efficiency and the ship&#x27;s speed during the battle, so much so that she was only capable of about with the current. Other damage to her steam piping and the connection between the funnel and the boilers raised the temperature in her fire room up to and in the casemate as a result.

The July 15 battle between the ironclads caused heavy damage to the &quot;Carondelet&quot; and inflicted 35 casualties. About 25 of the &quot;Arkansas&quot; crew had been killed or wounded during the battle.

===To Vicksburg===

In order to reach Vicksburg, &quot;Arkansas&quot; needed to force her way through the Union fleet. The crews of Farragut&#x27;s and Davis&#x27; ships had thought that the sound of the guns firing up the Yazoo were from a land engagement and the &quot;Queen of the West&quot;″s captain failed to alert the fleet upon his return. The Confederates had made some repairs to the boiler exhausts and &quot;Arkansas&quot; able to generate a moderate head of steam by burning oily material by the time she pursued &quot;Tyler&quot; into the Mississippi at 08:30. Only the ironclad had her boilers lit as there was a shortage of coal at that time, but the continued gunfire between &quot;Arkansas&quot; and &quot;Tyler&quot; caused the Union ships prepare for action by attempting to raise steam and manning their guns. For his part Brown initially decided to close all his gun ports and to keep his ship close to the Federal vessels, in order to prevent Union rams from getting much momentum on any ramming attack. The gunboat opened the fight which prompted Brown to return fire, badly damaging the Union ship. &quot;Arkansas&quot; was continuously fired upon from all directions with all of her guns replying as they saw targets at a range of about . Brown remained on the casemate roof as his ship approached Farragut&#x27;s largest ships, the wooden sloops and . Before the &quot;Arkansas&quot; could reach them, the ram passed by the ironclad in an attempt to ram her, but was disabled by a shot through the steam drum. Her exact casualties are unknown, but the Union ship was hit many times by friendly fire as she maneuvered into position.
The clouds of smoke produced by all the shooting greatly reduced visibility and the Union ships were additionally handicapped by the presence of Union transports and hospital ships on the other side of the river that might be damaged if they missed &quot;Arkansas&quot;. &quot;Hartford&quot; had to wait until the ironclad moved further downstream before she could open fire and was only able to fire a single volley before her guns could no longer bear. One of her shots penetrated the Confederate ship&#x27;s casemate and killed four men and wounded another. Another shot by the sloop killed or wounded the entire 16-man crew of one of the Columbiads and started a small fire that was quickly extinguished. One shot by either the gunboat or her sister penetrated the casemate near a Dahlgren gun, killing three men and wounding three others, travelled through the boiler exhaust to strike the far side of the casemate, killing or injuring 15 men at another gun. By this time the ironclad had little steam available and was mostly drifting with the current. Temperatures in the fire room required the crewmen to be rotated every fifteen minutes so they would not be overcome by heat exhaustion. Brown had thus far spent the entire battle either in the pilothouse or on the casemate&#x27;s roof and he returned to the latter position to seek relief from the heat. Despite his exposed position, he was only slightly wounded during the battle.

The improved visibility atop the casemate allowed him to see that the only remaining ships that he had to pass were a few of Davis&#x27; ironclads, although only two were combat worthy at that time. &quot;Benton&quot; had steam up and was able to move slowly as &quot;Arkansas&quot; approached, slowly enough that Brown attempted to ram her. The Union ironclad was able to speed up enough to evade the Confederate ship, although she was lightly damaged when the &quot;Arkansas&quot; fired a broadside into &quot;Benton&quot;″s stern as she passed by. The ironclad was the last ship barring the way to Vicksburg, but she barely had any speed up and was easily evaded. The two Union ironclads pursued the &quot;Arkansas&quot; until a brief gun duel with the city&#x27;s defenses caused them to head back upstream. The mortar boats below the city were warned that the ironclad was passing through the Union fleet and they temporarily withdrew downstream, during which time the schooner ran hard aground and was burned to prevent her capture. The Confederate ship had fired 97 shots during the day, only 24 of which had missed a Union ship.

&quot;Arkansas&quot; received an enthusiastic welcome at Vicksburg. A crowd formed at the wharf where the ship docked, and Van Dorn embraced Brown. However, several spectators observed the gory carnage within the ironclad and were unnerved. Thirty men had been killed or wounded on the vessel. Brown and his crew spent the rest of the day taking care of the dead and wounded, replenishing the ship&#x27;s supply of coal and making temporary repairs. An unknown number of volunteers from the city&#x27;s garrison were received to at least partially replace the day&#x27;s losses. During this time, the ironclad was ineffectually fired upon by the mortar boats and Union artillery and infantry units across the river. Farragut decided to run his fleet past the Vicksburg batteries and destroy &quot;Arkansas&quot; that evening. He had originally planned for the movement to begin at 16:00, but a storm came up, delaying the advance until 21:00. By then, it was getting dark. The &quot;Arkansas&quot; was rust-colored and was docked against a red riverbank, which made her much less visible and significantly degraded the accuracy of the Union guns. The fire from Farragut&#x27;s ships was generally ineffectual, although a shot from the sloop destroyed &quot;Arkansas&quot;″s sickbay, damaged her machinery and killed three crewmen and wounded three others. While the effect of the ironclad&#x27;s fire upon the Union ships is generally unknown, the shot that disabled the gunboat &quot;Winona&quot;″s engines is attributed to the &quot;Arkansas&quot;. While Farragut&#x27;s fleet made it downriver past Vicksburg, it had been unsuccessful in destroying its target and the Confederate guns were similarly ineffective. The Union fleet had suffered 92 casualties during the day&#x27;s actions.

The next day, July 16, saw Union ships begin firing at &quot;Arkansas&quot; with mortars, necessitating the frequent moving of the ship to keep the Union ships from getting the ironclad&#x27;s range. The Missourians had only joined the ship&#x27;s crew for duration of the run to Vicksburg, and returned to their commands on July 16. This left &quot;Arkansas&quot; with a serious crew shortage. Brown had permission from Van Dorn to recruit men from Vicksburg&#x27;s army garrison, but getting volunteers to serve on the ship was difficult due to the off putting effect of the damage from the ship&#x27;s fight with the Union fleet.

===Under the Vicksburg bluffs===
Three days after the fight, &quot;Arkansas&quot; had been repaired to a more mobile position again, and began posing a threat to the Union fleets, which were forced to keep steam pressure up so they could move if need be. At one point, the vessel attempted to threaten the Union&#x27;s mortar ships, but its engines failed before it entered range of the Union position; &quot;Arkansas&quot; returned to its starting position. The reduced crew still caused problems, as there were only enough men onboard to man three cannons at a time. After a conversation, Farragut and Davis decided to attack &quot;Arkansas&quot; at her position at Vicksburg. The attack fell on July 22, and was conducted by , &quot;Queen of the West&quot;, and . &quot;Essex&quot; was the largest ironclad the Union had available, and &quot;Queen of the West&quot; was the strongest ram.

&quot;Arkansas&quot; was not prepared for a battle. The ship&#x27;s engine was disabled, and the understrength crew was reduced even further with a number of men in hospitals at the time. Brown had only part of his officer corps and 28 crewmen present; only two cannons could be manned with the available crew. The Union vessels did not coordinate well. &quot;Essex&quot; tried to ram &quot;Arkansas&quot;, but the Confederate vessel maneuvered out of the way, while its opponent missed and temporarily ran aground. A close-range duel between the two ships followed, in which &quot;Essex&quot; suffered little damage, but a shot penetrated &quot;Arkansas&quot;, inflicting casualties. That single shot also damaged &quot;Arkansas&quot;″s superstructure. &quot;Queen of the West&quot; rammed the Confederate vessel, but caused no major damage; it also ran aground. Once the two Union ships freed themselves, &quot;Essex&quot; continued downriver from Vicksburg, while &quot;Queen of the West&quot; returned to the north of the city. A parting shot from &quot;Arkansas&quot; hit &quot;Queen of the West&quot; in the stern during the retreat; the shot had skipped off the water several times before striking the ship.

After the attack against &quot;Arkansas&quot;, Farragut decided that remaining in position near Vicksburg was no longer tenable. The expected seasonal drop in river level threatened to strand his ships on the Mississippi, a third of his sailors were sick, and the Navy was unlikely to receive needed help from the Army. The threat caused by the presence of &quot;Arkansas&quot; did not help the matter. On July 23, orders from United States Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles permitted Farragut to abandon the position and leave for the Gulf of Mexico. The next day, Farragut&#x27;s ships began the movement downriver, leaving Davis behind to continue bombarding the Confederates. However, Davis, on his own initiative, ordered a withdrawal to Helena, Arkansas, on July 28. His crews had been decimated by disease, and he risked not having enough men to continue to operate his ships if he did not withdraw.

===Final fight at Baton Rouge===

With the threat of the Union fleets no longer present, Brown was granted four days of leave at Grenada, Mississippi, for recovery from injuries. Before leaving, he ordered Lieutenant Henry K. Stevens that &quot;Arkansas&quot; should not be moved. Van Dorn was also informed that the ship&#x27;s engine problems prevented her from being usable without repairs. Brown fell ill, while Van Dorn planned an attack on the Union-held city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Major General John C. Breckinridge was in charge of the Confederate army assault against Baton Rouge, but soon saw almost half of his force stricken by disease. To make up for the loss in manpower, Breckinridge asked for &quot;Arkansas&quot; to support his attack. Despite the ship still being in a poor state of repair, Van Dorn ordered her to take part in the attack. Stevens objected, citing Brown&#x27;s orders that the ship should not be moved, and the question went to the Confederate States Department of the Navy, who decided not to intervene. After making final preparations, Stevens was forced to steam the ironclad towards Baton Rouge. Brown learned of the debate, and left his sickbed to prevent &quot;Arkansas&quot; from leaving Vicksburg, but learned that she had already left when he reached Jackson.

Complicating matters, the ship&#x27;s regular engineer was too sick to make the journey, and an army volunteer who lacked experience with the type of engines used on the ship served as the engineer. Engine troubles occurred during the journey, causing the ship to spin. &quot;Essex&quot; was one of the Union ships at Baton Rouge, and her fire helped repulse Breckinridge&#x27;s attack in the Battle of Baton Rouge. After reaching a point close enough to see Baton Rouge, Stevens and the ship&#x27;s pilot decided upon a plan of attack: to ram and sink &quot;Essex&quot; and then move downstream in order to block the retreat of the smaller Union vessels present. During the movement, &quot;Arkansas&quot; suffered another engine failure, which caused her to run aground on some cypress stumps. It took several hours to repair the engines, and some iron that had been covering the deck was thrown overboard to lighten the ship. &quot;Arkansas&quot; was able to free herself, but the strain on the engines caused a crank pin to break. A forge was constructed to create a new pin, and an engineer on board the ship with blacksmithing experience created a new one. Fixing the engine took all night, and when the ship attempted to move downstream again on August 6, the other engine broke down, rendering her immobile. &quot;Essex&quot; approached, and Stevens ordered the scuttling of his ship. Burning, &quot;Arkansas&quot; floated downstream before blowing up and sinking around noon.

In 1981, the National Underwater and Marine Agency discovered the wreck of &quot;Arkansas&quot; under a levee below Free Negro Point, near Mile 233. The site is possibly the location of an old sand and gravel pumping site that reported finding skeletons and projectiles.

<text>Tempeh or tempe (; , ) is a traditional Indonesian food made from fermented soybeans. It is made by a natural culturing and controlled fermentation process that binds soybeans into a cake form. A fungus, &quot;Rhizopus oligosporus&quot; or &quot;Rhizopus oryzae&quot;, is used in the fermentation process and is also known as tempeh starter.

It is especially popular on the island of Java, where it is a staple source of protein. Like tofu, tempeh is made from soybeans, but it is a whole-soybean product with different nutritional characteristics and textural qualities. Tempeh&#x27;s fermentation process and its retention of the whole bean give it a higher content of protein, dietary fiber, and vitamins. It has a firm texture and an earthy flavor, which becomes more pronounced as it ages.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;tempe&quot; is thought to be derived from the Old Javanese , a whitish food made of fried batter made from sago or rice flour which resembles &quot;rempeyek&quot;. The historian Denys Lombard also suggests that it could be linked to a later term or &quot;tapai&quot; which means &#x27;fermentation&#x27;.

In the western world, &quot;tempeh&quot; is the most common spelling. This is done to prevent readers from incorrectly pronouncing the word as &quot;temp&quot;. The first known usage of this spelling is in an 1896 German article. Other spellings, such as &quot;témpé&quot;, were also used, but &quot;tempeh&quot; has become the standard spelling in English since the 1960s.

==History==

Tempeh originated in Indonesia, according to historical evidence, tempeh was first made in Bayat, Klaten, Central Java, and was commonly consumed around 1700.

The invention of tempeh seems to have arisen through the serendipitous introduction to stored soybeans of the fungus, which is crucial in tempeh&#x27;s fermentation. This fungus grows on teakwood and sea hibiscus leaves, which native Javanese people often used (and still do) as food wrappings. In fact, in traditional tempeh making, an (a mycelium-filled leaf) is used, instead of store-bought .

The type of soybean first used to make tempeh was the black soybean, which was a native plant. This later changed with the importation of white or yellow soybeans and the rise of the tofu industry on the island.

===Debate over origins===

Murdijati Gardjito, a food historian at Gadjah Mada University, argued that tempeh was made by native Javanese people and that its preparation predates the introduction of Chinese-style tofu products. Some ancient texts mention , old Javanese for &#x27;native soybean tempeh&#x27;; was used to refer to the native soybean variety. White soybeans that are used to make most today used to be called (&#x27;white soybeans&#x27;), and were only available in Java centuries later. Mary Astuti, a food historian at Gadjah Mada University specializing in tempeh, argued that the native variety of soybean had been grown before the Chinese arrived in the region.

Sri Tandjung noted that Javanese had been eating cooked (native black) soybeans since the 12th century. By the 16th or the 19th century, depending on which period of time the writer of Serat Centhini referred to, Javanese people had mastered the art of cooking with tempeh, when it was not only eaten as is, but converted into different types of dishes, showing a full understanding and mastery of the food product.

Gardjito noted that Javanese noble families rarely wrote about tempeh in ancient texts because it had never been a part of royal cuisine, but rather a staple food of the lower classes.

Indonesian historian, Ong Hok Ham, suggests that tempeh might have been produced as a byproduct of , the Indonesian word for tofu. He argued that the two food products are made of the same ingredient and that genetically speaking, soybeans are from China, though the specific variety was never mentioned. Food journalist, Andreas Maryoto. supported this idea, saying that tempeh might have been accidentally produced as the by-product of the tofu industry in Java in the 17th century, as discarded soybeans caught the spores of a whitish fungus that was found to be edible.

However, was (and is still) made of white soybeans (&quot;Glycine max&quot;, native to Japan and China), as opposed to the earliest version of that was made of native black soybeans (&quot;Glycine soja&quot;).

 (tofu) made its way to Kediri in the 13th century and was consumed by the Mongolians who arrived in Java. Later, it was popular only among the rich (the complex production process and imported white soybeans led to its high price). Around the 17th or 19th century, became available to everyone.

Tempeh later began to be made with white soybeans, leading to the decreased use of its native black variety. Black soybeans have been replaced by other commodity plants since. The original version of has been forgotten as has become the common people&#x27;s food, and dependence on imported white soybeans grows.

==Production==

Tempeh begins with whole soybeans, which are softened by soaking, dehulled, then partly cooked. Specialty tempeh may be made from other types of beans, wheat, or may include a mixture of beans and whole grains. Adding vinegar during soybeans soaking process had also been reported in tempeh industries and it had been found to influence the sensory nature of the final product.

The principal step in making tempeh is the fermentation of soybeans which undergo inoculation with &quot;Rhizopus&quot; spp. molds, a type of filamentous fungus most widely used for the production of tempeh. A fermentation starter containing the spores of fungus &quot;Rhizopus oligosporus&quot; or &quot;Rhizopus oryzae&quot; is mixed in. The beans are spread into a thin layer and are allowed to ferment for 24 to 36 hours at a temperature around 30°C (86°F). The soybeans have to cool down to allow spore germination and abundant growth of mycelium. Later, the temperature of the beans will naturally rise and rapid mold growth happens for around 4 hours. As mold growth declines, the soybeans should be bound into a solid mass by the mycelium. In good tempeh, the beans are knitted together by a mat of white mycelium. Typically, tempeh is harvested after 48 hours of fermentation with its distinguishable whitish color, firm texture, and nutty flavor. Extended fermentation time results in an increase in pH and undesirable color darkening in the tempeh.

During the fermentation process, optimal time of fermentation, temperature, oxygen, humidity, and pH levels are required to encourage the growth of the &quot;Rhizopus&quot; mold, while discouraging the growth of undesired microorganisms. The pH level should be kept around 3-5 by adding a mild acidulant such as vinegar, lactic acid, or acetic acid, thereby favoring mold growth and restricting the growth of spoilage microorganisms. Oxygen is required for &quot;Rhizopus&quot; spp. growth, but should be maintained at low levels to prevent the production of undesired microorganisms. Under conditions of lower temperature, or higher ventilation, gray or black patches of spores may form on the surface—this is not harmful, and should not affect the flavor or quality of the tempeh. This sporulation is normal on fully mature tempeh. A mild ammonia smell may accompany good tempeh as it ferments, but it should not be overpowering.

Traditional tempeh is often produced in Indonesia using &quot;Hibiscus tiliaceus&quot; leaves. The undersides of the leaves are covered in downy hairs (known technically as trichomes) to which the mold &quot;Rhizopus oligosporus&quot; can be found adhering in the wild. Soybeans are pressed into the leaf, and stored. Fermentation occurs resulting in tempeh. In particular, the tempeh undergoes salt-free aerobic fermentation.

Tempeh made with traditional inoculation methods are also more likely to include molds of other species including &quot;Rhizopus arrhizus&quot; and &quot;Rhizopus delemar&quot; which may outcompete Rhizopus oligosporus as the dominant mold. This results in white woolly appearance and more pleasant aroma compared with tempeh made with commercial starter containing only Rhizopus oligosporus. Famously these variant tempeh are found in Malang and Purwokerto in the 1960s, because Malang is located in a cool plateau, and tempeh made with &quot;Rhizopus oligosporus&quot; resulted in less compact and more alcoholic-smelling tempeh, while &quot;Rhizopus arrhizus&quot; required lower optimum temperature which made it more ideal. However the widespread use of commercial starter resulted in most tempeh in Java only containing &quot;Rhizopus oligosporus&quot;, with few traditionally made tempeh outside Java still containing &quot;Rhizopus arrhizus&quot; and &quot;Rhizopus delemar&quot;.

=== Dry matter losses and yield ===
During the processing of soybeans to make tempeh there are inevitable losses of material due to the removal of the hulls and the leaching of soluble compounds during the soaking, washing and cooking stages. Hulls constitute about 8% of the dry beans and losses due to the leaching of soluble compounds equate to 12 - 17% of the dry beans. The oligosaccharides, stachyose, raffinose and sucrose, can constitute up to 50% of the soluble materials lost. During the fermentation there is some further loss of material due to respiration by the mold and the oxidation of compounds to carbon dioxide and water. Reported losses of dry matter during the fermentation range from 2.1 to 10%. Hence, the overall yield of tempeh is in the range of 72-78 g tempeh per 100 g soybeans on a dry matter basis. In practical terms, this means that 100 g dry soybeans (7-9% moisture content) will yield about 170 to 210 g fresh tempeh (61-64% moisture content).

=== Determining quality ===
Once tempeh is produced, it is divided into three categories based on its quality: good, unfinished, and inedible. Good tempeh includes beans that are bound into a firm, compact cake by a dense, uniform, white mycelium, which should permeate the entire cake; the beans should be barely visible. The odor of good tempeh should be pleasant, clean, subtly sweet or resemble the aroma of mushrooms. The entire tempeh should lift as a single, cohesive cake without crumbling when shaken gently. Unfinished tempeh has beans that are bound together loosely by a sparse white mycelium, hence it crumbles easily. Unfinished tempeh should be incubated longer unless it has been incubated more than eight hours past the recommended time. If it has been incubated for enough time and still remains unfinished, it should be discarded. Inedible tempeh has beans with foul odor, resembling strong ammonia or alcohol, indicating the development of undesirable bacteria due to excess moisture or overheating. Inedible tempeh cake is wet, slimy, and mushy with a collapsed structure. Its color is tan to brown and mold develops in sparse patches.

=== Packaging ===

Food grade wrapping paper and perforated polyethylene bags are the most suitable materials for packaging tempeh. They have demonstrated good retention of the quality of tempeh and extension of the shelf life of tempeh for three days compared to fresh tempeh. Appropriate packaging is important as it provides optimum oxygen supply and temperature for inoculation and fermentation to occur during processing. Tempeh is a perishable food and must be wrapped and placed into the refrigerator or freezer immediately after incubation or other processing steps such as blanching. In the refrigerator or freezer, stacking of tempeh should be minimized to prevent overheating and the undesirable, gradual continuation of fermentation, both of which shorten the storage life of tempeh. Even under cold temperature, tempeh continues to respire and undergo slow decomposition from microorganisms and its natural enzymes. Therefore, tempeh should be well cooled for at least two to five hours in a cooler before it undergoes further packaging. Tempeh packaged in perforated polyethylene bags is usually repacked inside another labeled, non-perforated bag for distribution, sale and easier labeling. If the tempeh is packaged in only one perforated bag, the label must be directly attached to the perforated surface with the use of government food contact approved adhesive. It is then bulk packed in cartons and returned to the refrigerator or freezer to await shipment.

==Nutrition==

Tempeh is 60% water, 20% protein, 8% carbohydrates, and 11% fats (table). In a reference amount of , tempeh supplies 192 calories, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of several B vitamins and dietary minerals, such as riboflavin (30% DV) and manganese (62% DV), respectively (table).

===Effects of fermentation===
The soy carbohydrates in tempeh become more digestible as a result of the fermentation process. In particular, the oligosaccharides associated with flatulence and indigestion are greatly reduced by the &quot;Rhizopus&quot; culture. In traditional tempeh-making shops, the starter culture often contains bacteria that produce vitamins such as B12 (though it is uncertain whether this B12 is always present and bioavailable).

In western countries, it is more common to use a pure culture containing only &quot;Rhizopus oligosporus&quot;, which makes little B12 and could be missing &quot;Citrobacter freundii&quot; and &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, which have been shown to produce significant levels of B12 analogs in tempeh when present.

Studies of fortifying tempeh with vitamin B12 through fermentation using microorganisms indicate that lactic acid bacteria and propionic acid bacteria produce vitamin B12.

==Preparation==

In the kitchen, tempeh is often simply prepared by cutting it into pieces, soaking in brine or a salty sauce, and then fried. In Java, tempeh is often traditionally prepared by cutting it into pieces, marinating it in a mixture of ground garlic, coriander, turmeric, salt and water; then deep fried, and it&#x27;s often served with &quot;sambal ulek&quot; chili paste. Cooked tempeh can be eaten alone, or used in chili, stir fries, soups, salads, sandwiches, and stews. Tempeh&#x27;s complex flavor has been described as nutty, meaty, and mushroom-like. It freezes well, and is now commonly available in many western supermarkets, as well as in ethnic markets and health food stores. Tempeh can be steamed, marinated, thinly sliced, blackened, or crumbled into sauces and stews.

Tempeh performs well in a cheese grater, after which it may be used in place of ground beef (as in tacos). When thin-sliced and deep-fried in oil, tempeh obtains a crisp golden crust while maintaining a soft interior. Its sponge-like consistency makes it suitable for marinating. Dried tempeh (whether cooked or raw) is more portable and less perishable and may be used as a stew base. Sometimes when tempeh is diced and left, it will create white feathery fluff which bonds the cut—this is the Rhizopus mold still growing—this is normal and perfectly edible.

==Types==

The most common and widely known tempeh is made from fermented soybeans, called or , made from controlled fermentation of soybeans. However, traditionally other ingredients such as (tofu dregs/okara), (coconut dregs) and peanuts may be used in a fashion similar to the tempeh-making process, although perhaps using different fungi or attracting other microbes like &quot;kara benguk&quot; or &quot;kara pedhang&quot;, which can be toxic if not prepared correctly. A related product to tempeh is &quot;oncom&quot;, which is made from peanut press cake or soy dregs and is prevalent in Sundanese culture in West Java. There are two types of &quot;oncom&quot;: a bright red-orange kind with &quot;Neurospora sitophila&quot;, and a black one with the same fungi as tempeh uses.
Tempeh can also be differentiated according to its degrees of maturity (i.e. the mycelium&#x27;s growth/age). is a tempeh that is not fully fermented, that is, the mycelium has not fully covered the surface. The taste of the beans is more solid and profound. Sometimes tempeh is left to ferment further, creating more pungent varieties: (day-old tempeh), i.e. when the tempeh starts to age; (a few-days old tempeh), i.e. when the tempeh becomes yellowish, a bit slimy, and the smell becomes more potent; and (lit. &#x27;rotten tempeh&#x27;), when the mycelium has acquired a blackened coloration and the product has a putrid smell.

Some types of tempeh are made of ingredients that would be otherwise wasted if not used. According to traditional Javanese customs, wasting food is deemed as a sign of disrespect to Nature and other beings, and encourages efforts to use every part of an ingredient.

The wrappings used in tempeh making can contribute to its flavor and aroma. Though some prefer the traditional banana, or teak leaf, readily available plastic sheet wrappings have been increasingly widely used.

Soft and fluffy tempeh made from soy pulp or tofu dregs. usually can be found in traditional markets of Java, at a price lower than that of common soybean tempeh. It is made into a variety of dishes; for example it can be battered and/or fried, used in , or . is known by different names across Java; for example as or in Temanggung.
In Indonesia, ripe tempeh (two or more days old) is considered a delicacy. Names include (&#x27;stinky tempeh&#x27;) in Java, (&#x27;almost rotten&#x27;) tempeh or (&#x27;yesterday tempeh&#x27;). Having a slightly pungent aroma, small amounts are used as a flavoring agent in traditional Javanese &quot;sayur lodeh&quot; vegetable stew and &quot;sambal tumpang&quot;.

In Javanese, the term means &#x27;leaf&#x27;. Traditionally tempeh is wrapped in organic banana leaf, (&quot;Hibiscus tiliaceus&quot; leaf) or (teak leaf).
Pure soybean cake, tempeh made in plastic wrap without any fillings or additives such as grated raw papaya. This was meant to create a more &quot;hygienic and pure&quot; tempeh free from any impurities or unwanted microbes.

A specialty of Malang, the rough-textured is made from black soybeans mixed with other ingredients, such as peanut dregs, cassava fiber, and soybean meal. The process of making is quite similar to black &quot;oncom&quot;.
 is a variety of tempeh from Central Java, notably Banyumas. It is prepared with coconut dregs. This type of tempeh served as a main source of protein in Java due to its inexpensiveness and has led to several cases of fatal food poisoning, as it occasionally gets contaminated with the bacterium &quot;Burkholderia gladioli&quot;, and the unwanted organism produces toxins (bongkrek acid and toxoflavin) from the coconut, besides killing off the &quot;Rhizopus&quot; fungus due to the antibiotic activity of acid.

Fatalities from contaminated were once common in the area where it was produced. During 1930s, Indonesian government went through an economic depression, and this condition caused some of the people to make tempe bongkrek by themselves, instead of buying it directly from well-trained producers. As a result, the poisonings occurred frequently, reaching 10 to 12 a year. Dutch scientists W. K. Mertens and A. G. van Veen from the Eijkman Institute of Jakarta, started to find the cause of the poisoning in the early 1930s. The first outbreak of the bongkrek poisoning by tempe bongkrek was recorded by Dutch researchers; however, no further research to find the cause of the poisoning was conducted in 1895. They successfully identified the source of poisoning as a bacterium called &quot;Pseudomonas cocovenenans&quot;. This bacterium, which is also named &quot;Burkholderia cocovenenans&quot;, caused the synthesis of a poisonous substance called bongkrek acid. &quot; B. cocovenenans &quot; is commonly found in plants and soil, which can be taken up by coconuts and corn, leading to the synthesis of bongkrek acid during the fermentation of such foods. Since 1975, consumption of contaminated tempe bongkrek has caused more than 3000 cases of bongkrek acid poisoning. In Indonesia, the overall reported mortality rate has turned out to be 60%. Due to the severity of the situation, the production of tempe bongkrek has been banned since 1988. Clandestine manufacture continues, however, due to the popular flavor. The problem of contamination is not encountered with bean and grain tempeh, which have a different composition of fatty acids that is not favorable for the growth of &quot;B. gladioli&quot;, but encourages growth of &quot;Rhizopus&quot; instead. When bean or grain tempeh has the proper color, texture and smell, it is a very strong indication the product is safe. Yellow is always highly toxic due to toxoflavin, but with a normal coloration may still contain lethal amounts of acid.

===Oat tempeh===
A form of tempeh based on barley and oats instead of soy was developed by scientists at the Swedish Department of Food Science in 2008. It can be produced in climatic regions where it is not possible to grow soybeans.

== Cooking methods and recipes ==

The simplest way to cook tempeh is by frying. It is both deep-fried and stir-fried. However, there are several cooking methods and recipe variations. Among others are:
Perhaps the simplest and most popular way to prepare tempeh in Indonesia. The tempeh is sliced and seasoned in a mixture of ground garlic, coriander seeds and salt, and then deep fried in palm oil. The tempeh might be coated in batter prior to frying, or directly fried without any batter. Fried unbattered tempeh has a golden-brown color when done.
 is a traditional Javanese dish originating in Central Java. is a Javanese cooking method of braising in spices and palm sugar and boiling the food in a closed place until the water runs out. The tempeh is first braised in a mixture of coconut water, palm sugar, and spices including coriander seeds, shallots, galangal, and bay leaves, and then briefly deep-fried. The result is a moist, sweet and spicy, dark-colored tempeh. Tofu may also be used, yielding .


This variation is often found in Purwokerto. The word originates in the Banyumas regional dialect, and means &#x27;flash-fried&#x27;. The tempeh is first dipped in spiced flour before quickly frying in very hot oil, resulting in a product that is cooked on the outside, but raw or only partially so on the inside. It has a limp, soft texture compared to the more common, crisp, fully fried tempeh.

Also known as (lit: &#x27;dry tempeh&#x27;), or if mixed with plenty of hot and spicy &quot;sambal&quot; chili pepper sauce. It is a crispy, sweet and spicy, fried tempeh. The raw tempeh is cut into small sticks and thoroughly deep-fried until no longer moist, and then mixed with palm sugar, chili pepper or other spices, or with sweet soy sauce. Often it is mixed with separately fried peanuts and anchovies (). This dry tempeh will keep for up to a month if cooked and stored properly.

=== or ===
This variation is almost identical to , but is more soft and moist. The sweet taste is due to generous addition of &quot;kecap manis&quot; (sweet soy sauce).

=== or ===
Stir-fried tempeh with vegetables such as green bean, basil, or onion, with spices. Other recipes might add coconut milk for a milky-colored, and rather moist, stir-fried tempeh.
Fried tempeh mixed with &quot;sambal&quot; chili paste in a mortar and pestle. Usually served in addition to other dishes, such as &quot;ayam penyet&quot; (chicken) or &quot;iga penyet&quot; (ribs).
Tempeh skewered and grilled as satay.

 (Javanese for &#x27;poor man&#x27;s satay&#x27;) from Solo in Central Java is made from fluffy . Ground tempeh can also be made into a thick sauce, such as in , a chicken satay from Kebumen, Central Java where tempeh flavored with chili and spices replaces the more common peanut sauce.
&quot;Kripik&quot; snack crackers; a thinly sliced tempeh, battered and deep fried until crispy. It is popular across Java, but notably produced in Bandung, West Java and Malang, East Java.

===Tempeh sandwich or tempeh burger===
Fried, grilled or otherwise cooked tempeh patties, sandwiched between slices of bread or hamburger buns with salad, sauces or seasonings.

==Preservation==

Freshly made, raw tempeh remains edible for a few days at room temperature. It is neither acidic nor does it contain significant amounts of alcohol. It, however, does possess stronger resistance to lipid peroxidation than unfermented soybeans due to its antioxidant contents.

Cooked as , the deep-fried and seasoned bits of tempeh can last for a month or more and still be good to consume, if cooked correctly and stored properly in an air-tight jar. The deep-frying process removes the moisture, preventing further fermentation and deterioration, thus prolonging its shelf life.

=== Antimicrobial agents ===
&quot;Rhizopus&quot; cultures responsible for the fermentation of tempeh from soybean produce natural, heat-stable antimicrobial agents against spoilage and disease-causing microorganisms, extending the shelf life of the fermented product through microbial antagonism. The mold is capable of inhibiting the growth of other fungi such as &quot;Aspergiluus flavus&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus parasiticus&quot; by interfering with the accumulation of aflatoxin (especially aflatoxin B1), the mycotoxin of greatest concern. &quot;R. oligosporus&quot; has also been reported to produce four to five antibacterial substances during fermentation process. It produces phenolic compounds against pathogenic bacteria such as &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; and an antibacterial protein has been identified with activities against &quot;Bacillus&quot; species (especially against &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; and &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot;), &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and &quot;Streptococcus cremoris&quot;.

=== Non-refrigerated fresh tempeh ===
Tempeh can be sold and consumed fresh within 48 hours once removed from its incubator. It is commonly transported to the market in its incubation container (e.g. polyethylene bag, banana leaf wrapper, etc.) and placed in the shade. In areas with warmer climates, tempeh can be kept at room temperature for one to three days before it becomes overripe. In locations with more temperate temperatures, it can keep for one to four days but will usually need to be refrigerated to prevent spoilage.

=== Refrigeration ===
Fresh refrigerated tempeh should be sealed in a labeled polyethylene bag and kept in temperatures below . It can be kept at this temperature for three to five days and sometimes, even as long as a week. Storage life could be extended to two or three weeks if the tempeh is blanched or steamed prior to refrigeration due to the inactivation of enzymes and destruction of bacteria.

=== Freezing ===
Freezing is the preferred way to preserve tempeh due to its capability for wide distribution. Tempeh can be frozen whole or in slices, depending on preference. During the freezing process, whole tempeh is placed in its perforated wrapper whereas sliced tempeh is packaged in a labelled polyethylene bag prior to being sealed in an outer bag and then frozen immediately. This method will keep for months with only a small loss of texture and flavor.

=== Blanching ===
Blanching tempeh by steaming or parboiling helps to extend the storage life by preventing bacterial growth, stopping mold growth and inactivating enzymes. Steaming appears to have a less negative effect than parboiling in terms of texture, flavor and nutritional value. Blanching is a great method for preserving tempeh prior to refrigeration, though not as beneficial for tempeh that is to be frozen.

=== Dehydration ===

==== Air tray drying ====
Tempeh can be dried via the air tray drying method. Cubes of tempeh placed on steel, mesh bottom trays are dried by the circulating hot air dryer. After the product is finished, they can be cut into squares at for 90 to 120 minutes in order to reduce moisture content to 2–4%. When placed in moisture proof Pliofilm bags, the tempeh has a shelf life of several months at room temperature. Although this is a convenient method that produces a shelf stable product without requirement of refrigeration, the process of hot air drying can cause a significant loss of nutritional content such as the soluble solids and nitrogen protein content.

==== Sun drying ====
This preservation method is most economical out of all methods. The tempeh can be blanched prior to dehydration to preserve flavor and prolong shelf life. Tempeh is exposed to internal solar dryer temperature of in this method. A disadvantage of this method is that sunlight can destroy some of the vitamin B12 of tempeh.

==== Freeze-drying ====
This method is the most expensive out of all dehydration methods but provides the advantage of long stable shelf life at room temperature and an excellent retention of soluble nutrients (nitrogen protein and other solids). The product undergoes quick freeze at and is then dried at a moderate temperature inside a strong vacuum. Due to the expensive nature of the equipment, the final product price is higher than tempeh preserved through other methods.

==== Spray-drying ====
As this method is traditionally used for small particles, it is used to produce tempeh powder for products such as soups, breads, tortillas, etc. However, this method can be expensive due to the bulky nature of the equipment.

==== Deep-frying ====
This method produces ready to eat tempeh products. A culinary oil with a high smoke point, such as rapeseed, soy, safflower, peanut, or coconut oil, is heated to in the deep fryer. The tempeh is deep-fried until golden brown and crisp, and then cooled quickly in a sterile environment to be sealed in Pliofilm bags and stored in a cool, dry place. The shelf life of this product lasts around a week but can be extended if the tempeh is sun dried or oven dried prior to deep frying.

<text>Isaac Newton Brown (May 27, 1817 – September 1, 1889) was a naval officer in both the United States Navy and the Confederate States Navy. 

Isaac N. Brown was born in Caldwell County, Kentucky, but spent part of his later youth in western Tennessee. In March 1834, shortly after his father died, he joined the United States Navy as a midshipman. He received a commission as a lieutenant in 1846 and later participated in the Mexican–American War. He married, owned property on the Mississippi Delta, and had three sons. He remained in the Navy and made several trips around the world on various ships.

Shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, he resigned his commission. In June, he accepted a commission as a lieutenant in the fledgling Confederate States Navy. Brown was assigned to the Mississippi River region by the Confederate Naval Department. In May 1862 he was ordered to Yazoo City, Mississippi, to take command of the unfinished ironclad CSS &quot;Arkansas&quot; and complete her construction in the worst of conditions. After successfully accomplishing this difficult task, Brown commanded her dramatic breaking of the Union blockade of Vicksburg, Mississippi, on July 15, 1862.

Brown was promoted to commander in August 1862 in recognition of his bold and audacious actions at Vicksburg. Commander Brown served as captain of the ironclad CSS &quot;Charleston&quot;, which operated in defense of Charleston, South Carolina, during 1863–1865.

At the end of the Civil War, Brown took up farming in Mississippi and later moved to Texas. He died at Corsicana, Texas, and is buried in Oakwood Cemetery.

The Sons of Confederate Veterans awarded their Confederate Medal of Honor, started in 1977, to Brown for his distinguished service.

<doc id="293046" wikidata="Q239587" url="?curid=293046" title="Aimee Mann">
<text>Aimee Elizabeth Mann (born September 8, 1960) is an American singer-songwriter. Over the course of four decades, she has released ten studio albums as a solo artist. She is noted for her sardonic and literate lyrics about dark subjects, often describing underdog characters. Her work with the producer Jon Brion in the 1990s was influential on American alternative rock.

Mann was born in Richmond, Virginia, and studied at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. In the 1980s, after playing with the Young Snakes and Ministry, she co-founded the new wave band &#x27;Til Tuesday and wrote their top-ten single &quot;Voices Carry&quot; (1985). &#x27;Til Tuesday released three albums and disbanded in 1990 when Mann left to pursue a solo career.

Mann&#x27;s first two solo albums, &quot;Whatever&quot; (1993) and &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot; (1995), earned positive reviews but low sales, and placed Mann in conflict with her record company, Geffen. She achieved wider recognition for her contributions to the soundtrack for the Paul Thomas Anderson film &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999). Her song &quot;Save Me&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal. After Geffen refused to release her third album, &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot;, Mann released it under her own label, SuperEgo Records, in 2000. It achieved acclaim and strong sales, establishing Mann as a career artist who could work outside the major label system.

In 2014, Mann released an album with Ted Leo as the Both. Mann also paints and makes comics, and has appeared in film and television series including &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Steven Universe&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;Portlandia&quot;. Her awards include two Grammy Awards, including Best Folk Album for &quot;Mental Illness&quot; (2017). She was named one of the greatest living songwriters by NPR and &quot;Paste&quot;.

==Early life==

Mann was born at the Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, on September 8, 1960. When she was three, her mother had an affair and became pregnant and her parents divorced. Mann was kidnapped by her mother and her new boyfriend and taken to Europe, where they traveled. Mann&#x27;s father, a marketing executive, hired a private detective, who brought her back from England a year later to a new stepmother and two stepbrothers. Mann said her father seemed &quot;like a stranger&quot; when they were reunited. The kidnapping gave Mann post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety around travelling later in life. She did not see her mother again until she was 14. She forgave her decades later, saying her mother had been &quot;trapped on every side&quot;.

Mann grew up in Bon Air, Virginia, and attended Midlothian High School in Chesterfield County. She was withdrawn and would not talk, and her father and stepmother sent her to a psychiatrist. Her drama teacher recalled her as &quot;kind of an insecure kid, very quiet, very introspective … When she did start talking, she was worth listening to.&quot;

Mann learned to play her brother&#x27;s guitar when she was confined to bed with glandular fever at the age of 12. As a teenager, she enjoyed David Bowie and Iggy Pop and was inspired by punk and new wave music. She said: &quot;[It] was so interesting, so inventive – literally do whatever you want. That Patti Smith was out there and people were accepting her? Oh my God, there&#x27;s a way out.&quot;

In 1978, feeling she did not fit in the &quot;normal world&quot;, Mann enrolled in Berklee College of Music in Boston to study bass guitar. She had wanted to learn the bass as a child, but her family ridiculed her, saying it was unladylike. After 18 months, she dropped out and joined the Boston punk band the Young Snakes on bass. She was unhappy in the band, saying the other members objected to her writing love songs or music they considered too melodic. She joined the band Ministry, which she said helped her learn to write songs efficiently. In the early 1980s, she worked at Newbury Comics in Massachusetts.

==Career==
===1980s: &#x27;Til Tuesday===

At Berklee, Mann and Michael Hausman formed a new wave band, &#x27;Til Tuesday, with Mann providing bass and vocals. They signed to Epic Records and released &quot;Voices Carry&quot;, their debut album, in 1985. The single &quot;Voices Carry&quot; reached number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and won that year&#x27;s MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist. According to Mann, &quot;Voices Carry&quot; was one of the first songs she wrote. &quot;Stereogum&quot; described it as &quot;an early indicator of Mann&#x27;s penchant for character study, drawing outside the lines of boy-meets-girl love songs&quot;. The success made Mann an early female MTV star. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; described her as &quot;a neo-punk pop princess, a new wave glamour girl, all doe eyes, gangly limbs and spiky bleached hair with that long, braided tail snaking out from underneath&quot;.

&#x27;Til Tuesday released &quot;Welcome Home&quot;, their second album, in 1986. Mann sang vocals with Geddy Lee on the 1987 single &quot;Time Stand Still&quot; by Rush, and appeared in the music video. &#x27;Til Tuesday released their third and final album, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Different Now&quot;, in 1988, with songs influenced by Mann&#x27;s breakup with the singer-songwriter Jules Shear. It demonstrated a significant development in Mann&#x27;s songwriting, and included a song co-written with Elvis Costello, &quot;The Other End of the Telescope&quot;. &quot;Everything&#x27;s Different Now&quot; was a commercial failure; Mann said it had been abandoned by Epic following a change of staff.

&#x27;Til Tuesday broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career. She said later that her musical interests had changed, and that she was more interested in &quot;acoustic guitar music&quot; than the new wave pop of &#x27;Til Tuesday. Hausman, her former boyfriend, became her manager. Epic did not release Mann from her record contract for another three years, which prevented her from releasing new material. It was the first of several disputes Mann had with record labels, which Hausman said had a lasting effect on her attitude to the music industry.

=== 1990–1995: Solo beginnings, &quot;Whatever&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot; ===

Mann recorded her first solo albums with the producer Jon Brion, who had been a member of the &#x27;Til Tuesday touring band. Mann found working with Brion exciting and felt her songwriting improved with him. Together, they developed a sound that the &quot;Stereogum&quot; writer Doug Bleggi called &quot;LA alternative&quot;. Mann&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Whatever&quot;, was released in 1993 on the independent label Imago. It earned positive reviews but did not meet sales expectations. In 1994, Mann moved to Los Angeles. She also toured as part of the British band Squeeze, playing her own songs and songs by Squeeze.

After Mann finished her second album, &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot;, Imago encountered financial problems and delayed its release. Imago eventually sold it to Geffen, which signed Mann in 1994 and released &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot; in 1995. According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, while Mann&#x27;s solo albums demonstrated she was &quot;a witty, self-possessed songwriter&quot;, she was still failing to meet commercial expectations, with sales in the low six figures. Mann began to be seen as a relic of the 1980s. Dick Wingate, the executive who signed &#x27;Til Tuesday to Epic, described Mann as &quot;the model of an artist who has been chewed up and spit out by the music business&quot;. He said disappointment and bad luck had made her distrustful of record labels.

=== 1995–1999: Film work and &quot;Magnolia&quot; ===
Mann recorded a cover of the 1968 song &quot;One&quot; by Harry Nillson for the 1995 tribute album &quot;For the Love of Harry: Everybody Sings Nilsson&quot;. She wrote &quot;Wise Up&quot; for the 1996 film &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, but the director, Cameron Crowe, felt it did not fit. It was included on the &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; soundtrack. In 1997, Mann recorded a cover of &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot;, the theme song of the 1977 James Bond film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, for the album &quot;Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project&quot;. Mann contributed her song &quot;Amateur&quot; to the film &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; and made a cameo in the film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; as a German nihilist, both released in 1998.
Later in the decade, Mann became a regular act at Largo, a Los Angeles nightclub that hosted performances from alternative songwriters including Brion, Elliott Smith, Fiona Apple and Rufus Wainwright. This shaped Mann&#x27;s songwriting; Largo fit her so well that the owner jokingly nicknamed it &quot;Aimee Mann&#x27;s clubhouse&quot;.

Mann received wider recognition after she contributed songs to the 1999 film &quot;Magnolia&quot;, including &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Wise Up&quot; and songs she was writing for her third album. Two songs, &quot;Save Me&quot; and &quot;You Do&quot;, were written for the film. &quot;Magnolia&quot; features dialogue taken from Mann&#x27;s lyrics and a sequence in which the cast sing &quot;Wise Up&quot;. The director, Paul Thomas Anderson, another Largo regular, said he &quot;sat down to write an adaptation of Aimee Mann songs&quot;.

The &quot;Magnolia&quot; soundtrack was certified gold. &quot;Save Me&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal and an Academy Award for Best Original Song; Mann performed it at the 72nd Academy Awards. In 2021, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described &quot;Save Me&quot; as Mann&#x27;s masterpiece, which &quot;solidified Mann&#x27;s stature as an esteemed songwriter&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named it among the best songs of the 1990s. Mann later said the song &quot;really gave a blood transfusion to my career. But it wasn&#x27;t like I went from playing to five people to 5,000 people. It was just a real influx of energy.&quot; The success of the &quot;Magnolia&quot; soundtrack caused Mann stress, as she felt pressure to capitalize on it and tour heavily.

=== 1999–2001: &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot; and label independence ===
Mann took more control over the production of her third album, &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot;. It includes Mann&#x27;s second collaboration with Elvis Costello, &quot;The Fall of the World&#x27;s Own Optimist&quot;. Geffen refused to release the album, feeling it contained no hit singles. In response, Mann sold homemade EPs of her new music on tour in 1999, which she described as a &quot;DIY fuck-you-record-company-I&#x27;m-selling-it-myself move&quot;. She accepted an offer from Geffen to leave her contract, deciding to be &quot;in charge of her own destiny&quot;.

In 1999, Mann and Hausman formed their own label, SuperEgo Records. With Mann&#x27;s husband, the songwriter Michael Penn, they also established United Musicians, a collective working outside the major label system. Using the money earned through royalties from &quot;Magnolia&quot;, Mann bought the &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot; masters from Geffen. She sold 25,000 copies of the album via mail order from her website, a large amount for an independent artist. After she secured a distribution deal, &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot; sold 270,000 copies, outperforming &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot;. &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot; became the 28th-best-reviewed album of the decade, according to the aggregation website Metacritic. The success established Mann as a career artist who could work outside of the major label system.

In 2000, Mann and Penn performed together on a small tour, Acoustic Vaudeville, with the comedian Patton Oswalt. In 2001, Mann sued Universal Music over the release of a greatest-hits compilation, &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;, which she had not authorized and considered &quot;substandard and misleading&quot;. The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; characterized the lawsuit as one of several challenges to major labels by female musicians that year, including Courtney Love and the Dixie Chicks. That year, Mann was also a judge at the inaugural Annual Independent Music Awards, an award for promoting independent musicians. She judged the awards again in 2011.

=== 2002—2004: &quot;Lost in Space&quot; and &quot;Live at St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse&quot; ===
Following the success of &quot;Magnolia&quot; and &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot;, Mann had a mental breakdown and entered a period of depression. She also had intrusive thoughts resulting from an accident when the car of a drunk driver flipped her tour bus. In 2002, she entered the Sierra Tucson rehabilitation center with anxiety and depression, and PTSD triggered by her kidnapping as a child.

Mann referenced her health problems obliquely in her fourth album, &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, released in August 2002. &quot;Paste&quot; described it as &quot;another marvelous collection of Mann&#x27;s intimate portraits of lost love and broken people, all set to a wry pop soundtrack that often lilts at the precise moment that one would expect dour melancholy&quot;.

In 2004, Mann released &quot;Live at St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse&quot;, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of shows in Brooklyn, New York City. She also appeared in the TV series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, performing &quot;This Is How It Goes&quot; and &quot;Pavlov&#x27;s Bell&quot;, and on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, performing a cover of James Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Shed a Little Light&quot;. Mann sang on &quot;That&#x27;s Me Trying&quot;, cowritten and produced by Ben Folds, from William Shatner&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Has Been&quot;.

=== 2005–2007: &quot;The Forgotten Arm&quot; and &quot;One More Drifter in the Snow&quot; ===

In May 2005, Mann released &quot;The Forgotten Arm&quot;, a concept album set in the 1970s about two lovers who go on the run. It was produced by Joe Henry and recorded mostly live in the studio. The album artwork won a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. Though &quot;The Forgotten Arm&quot; received generally positive reviews, the &quot;AV Club&quot; felt Mann&#x27;s work was becoming formulaic.

In October 2006, Mann released &quot;One More Drifter in the Snow&quot;, a Christmas album featuring covers and new songs. It was the first of several albums produced by Mann&#x27;s bassist, Paul Bryan. Mann said she did not enjoy Christmas songs that use modern genres, and instead drew inspiration from classic Christmas records by Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee and the Vince Guaraldi Trio. 

That year, Mann began an annual tradition of playing Christmas shows combining music and comedy. Guests have included Oswalt, Jeff Goldblum, Grant-Lee Phillips, Nellie McKay and Rich Sommer. Mann described it as a &quot;Christmas show for people who don&#x27;t really like Christmas&quot;. In 2007, Mann contributed two original songs, &quot;The Great Beyond&quot; and &quot;At the Edge of the World&quot;, to the soundtrack to the film &quot;Arctic Tale&quot;. She also contributed vocals to &quot;Unforgiven&quot; on John Doe&#x27;s album &quot;A Year in the Wilderness&quot;. 

=== 2008—2012: &quot;@#%&amp;*! Smilers&quot; and &quot;Charmer&quot; ===
In June 2008, Mann released her seventh album, &quot;@#%&amp;*! Smilers&quot;. It features minimal electric guitar and an emphasis on keyboards. It debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 32 and on the Top Independent Albums chart at number 2. &quot;@#%&amp;*! Smilers&quot; received mostly positive reviews, with AllMusic writing that it &quot;pops with color, something that gives it an immediacy that&#x27;s rare for an artist known for songs that subtly worm their way into the subconscious ... &quot;Smilers&quot; grabs a listener, never making him or her work at learning the record, as there are both big pop hooks and a rich sonic sheen.&quot; The artwork, by Gary Taxali, was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Recording Package.

In May 2011, Mann performed for President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama at a poetry seminar at the White House. She also appeared in a sketch for the Independent Film Channel series &quot;Portlandia&quot;. Mann played herself as a cleaner, explaining that she needs the second job to support herself. 

In 2012, Mann released her eighth solo album, &quot;Charmer&quot;, comprising songs based on the theme that personal charm should not always be trusted. One song, &quot;Crazytown&quot;, is about an alcoholic &quot;manic pixie dream girl&quot;. Two singles were released: &quot;Charmer&quot;, with a music video directed by Tom Scharpling, and &quot;Labrador&quot;, with a video featuring the actor Jon Hamm and references to Mann&#x27;s music videos with &#x27;Til Tuesday. In the same year, Mann contributed vocals to Steve Vai&#x27;s album &quot;The Story of Light&quot; on &quot;No More Amsterdam&quot; and recorded the song &quot;Two Horses&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Tim and Eric&#x27;s Billion Dollar Movie&quot;. Mann sang backing vocals on the 2013 Heidecker &amp; Wood album &quot;Some Things Never Stay the Same&quot;.

=== 2013—2019: The Both and &quot;Mental Illness&quot; ===

In 2013, Mann appeared on the Ivan &amp; Alyosha album &quot;All the Times We Had&quot;. In February, she and Ted Leo formed a duo, the Both, and performed shows in Los Angeles and San Francisco. They released an album on SuperEgo in April 2014; &quot;Spin&quot; described it as &quot;the best thing either artist has ever done&quot;. On July 22, Mann filed a lawsuit against MediaNet, saying they were distributing 120 of her songs on an expired license agreement. She attempted to claim as much as $18 million in statutory damages. Mann settled out of court in 2015.

In February 2014, Mann appeared in an episode of the animated series &quot;Steven Universe&quot; as the voice of a female warrior, Opal&quot;.&quot; She reprised her role for &quot;Steven Universe: The Movie&quot; (2019), performing the song &quot;Independent Together&quot; with Leo. Mann contributed a version of Styx&#x27;s &quot;Come Sail Away&quot; to the 2014 &quot;Community&quot; episode &quot;Geothermal Escapism&quot;. In 2015, Mann and Leo appeared on the talk show &quot;Conan&quot; performing a song in support of the 2016 US presidential candidate Lincoln Chafee. Mann covered the 1973 Carpenters single &quot;Yesterday Once More&quot; for a 2016 episode of the HBO drama &quot;Vinyl&quot;. In October 2016, Mann released a new song, &quot;Can&#x27;t You Tell&quot;, as part of the &quot;30 Days 30 Songs&quot; campaign protesting the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.

In March 2017, Mann released her ninth solo album, &quot;Mental Illness&quot;, a collection of sparse acoustic songs featuring collaborations with the songwriters Jonathan Coulton and John Roderick. The title was suggested by a friend, which Mann found a &quot;bald, accurate and funny&quot; description of her songwriting themes. &quot;Mental Illness&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Folk Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. Coulton joined Mann for some performances on the &quot;Mental Illness&quot; tour.

That September, Mann contributed the song &quot;Everybody Bleeds&quot; to an episode of the Netflix series &quot;Big Mouth&quot;. In January 2018, Mann appeared in an episode of the FX series &quot;The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story&quot; as a bar singer, performing the 1984 Cars song &quot;Drive&quot;. She also appeared in the sitcom &quot;Corporate&quot; in the episode &quot;The Pain of Being Alive&quot;. In 2019, Mann released an expanded 20th-anniversary reissue of &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot; for Record Store Day. She also hosted a podcast with Leo, &quot;The Art of Process&quot;, interviewing celebrities including Wyatt Cenac and Rebecca Sugar.

===2020s: &quot;Queens of the Summer Hotel&quot; and artwork===

In 2020, Mann wrote a song, &quot;Big Deal&quot;, for the animated series &quot;Central Park&quot;, performed by Stanley Tucci. On November 5, 2021, Mann released her tenth album, &quot;Queens of the Summer Hotel&quot;. It features songs inspired by &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, the 1993 memoir by Susanna Kaysen about her time in a psychiatric hospital. Mann had developed the songs for a musical based on the memoir with the producers Barbara Broccoli and Frederick Zollo, which was canceled by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In January 2022, Mann began posting autobiographical comics on Instagram. She said that making comics was similar to songwriting: &quot;Having a short amount of time to make a point or to tell a little story ... It&#x27;s by necessity very truncated.&quot; She described making comics as a &quot;weird, lonely, insular drive-yourself-crazy activity&quot;, unlike the communal nature of music. In 2023, Mann mentioned plans to create a graphic memoir.

In April 2022, Mann displayed a series of her paintings, &quot;You Could Have Been a Roosevelt&quot;, at City Winery, Manhattan. The paintings are portraits of &quot;the ten worst US presidents&quot; and a selection of first ladies. Mann created them after promising her friend, the politician Antony Blinken, a painting for his White House office. She said that Blinken &quot;declined to have a portrait of Millard Fillmore on his wall, and I can&#x27;t say I blame him&quot;. On May 22, Mann led a lineup of women performers at the Novo club in Los Angeles, raising funds for the Magee Women&#x27;s Institute.

Mann was dropped from a supporting slot on Steely Dan&#x27;s 2022 tour. Donald Fagen, the co-founder of Steely Dan, denied rumors that he felt a female singer-songwriter would not suit their audience, and instead said Mann was not a good musical fit. He apologized, saying he respected Mann and did not realize any commitment had been made. Mann accepted the apology and said it was plausible that Fagen did not know she had been announced for the tour. She covered the Steely Dan song &quot;Brooklyn (Owes the Charmer Under Me)&quot; on tour that year.

In January 2023, Mann launched an Audible podcast, &quot;Straw into Gold&quot;, in which she interviewed artists about the connection between art and trauma. In January 2025, Mann organized a fundraiser for her longtime producer Paul Bryan, who lost his home and recording studio in the Palisades Fire. Mann is due to reunite with &#x27;Til Tuesday for their first show in 33 years at the Cruel World Festival in Pasadena in May 2025.

== Songwriting ==

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; characterized Mann&#x27;s music as &quot;refined guitar pop filled with attuned details and characters more often associated with the best short stories&quot;. The journalist Jon Pareles described Mann as a &quot;formalist of pop songwriting&quot; whose &quot;verses, choruses and bridges arrive in their proper places and melodies trace a measured, symmetrical rise and fall&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Ben Ratliff wrote of Mann&#x27;s &quot;urbane pop songs, melodically rich and full of well-worn sayings fitted into spiky couplets&quot;. Mann said songwriting was &quot;an exercise in order... To attempt to describe something — to make connections, to put pieces together, to try to sum up complicated ideas in a three-and-a-half minute song — that&#x27;s trying to put chaos in order for me.&quot;

Mann played the bass guitar with the Young Snakes, &#x27;Til Tuesday and the Both. For her own shows, she generally plays acoustic guitar, finding it &quot;more convenient&quot;. On her first solo albums, Mann and the producer Jon Brion created a sound the &quot;Stereogum&quot; writer Doug Bleggi called &quot;LA alternative&quot;. The style is associated with turn-of-the-century alternative acts such as Fiona Apple, Elliott Smith, Rufus Wainwright and Eels, all of whom worked with Brion in the 1990s. Several of Mann&#x27;s later albums were produced by Paul Bryan.

In the 1990s, Mann came under pressure from her record company, Geffen, to write hit singles, which she found frustrating. When she attempted to write catchy and lyrically accessible songs, she became bored and could not finish them. She felt that record companies attempted to &quot;remove everything that&#x27;s interesting&quot; from her songs, and concluded: &quot;My music is not going to sell outside a certain audience, so why not leave it alone so you don&#x27;t alienate the people who actually like it?&quot; Mann said she was not interested in being a pop star, and said: &quot;It takes a special skill to be a big star and I just don&#x27;t have those skills, so there isn&#x27;t much point in me pretending.&quot;

Writing for the &quot;New Yorker&quot; in 2000, Nick Hornby wrote that Mann was &quot;a fine, occasionally brilliant singer-songwriter, nothing more, nothing less, and this plainness of purpose has cost her dearly over the last fifteen, mostly calamitous, years&quot;. He said she had not found wider success as she did not meet expectations for female singer-songwriters: &quot;She is not one of the lads, like Sheryl Crow; she is outspoken rather than introspective, which means that she has little in common with the Carole King school; and she is much too grown-up and circumspect to want to bare her pain in the way that Tori Amos and Fiona Apple do.&quot;

In 2006, &quot;Paste&quot; named Mann the 54th-greatest living songwriter, and NPR named her among the ten greatest living songwriters. Robin Hilton of NPR wrote that she was &quot;vastly underrated&quot; and had &quot;a real gift for piercing the heart of something, revealing instead of telling and wrapping it all up in inspired melodies&quot;.

=== Lyrics ===
Mann is noted for her sharp and literate lyrics. She said she admires precision in lyrics and that she liked rhymes that are &quot;perfect and interesting&quot;. She explores dark subjects such as mental illness and suicide, and writes about underdog characters who are lost, lonely or exist outside of society. In &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Chris Dahlen wrote of Mann&#x27;s skill in writing about dark subjects without self-pity, and in using specific imagery to carry general meanings. Another &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer, Eric Torres, attributed Mann&#x27;s penchant for underdog characters to her struggles in the music industry. In &quot;Paste&quot;, Dave Sims wrote that &quot;Mann&#x27;s first-person protagonists invariably find themselves on the raw end of a doomed romance, ducking out under a smokescreen of half-mumbled mea culpas and a cloud of fatalism&quot;.

Mann combines sad music and themes with humorous or sarcastic lyrics to create the sense of a narrator trying to hide their feelings. She felt this was sadder than simply stating the feelings directly. She said: &quot;I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m the only person who thinks any lines or any moments are funny, but that&#x27;s usually because they&#x27;re the most accurate and bleak ones.&quot; In the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Nate Chinen wrote that &quot;the sugarcoated poison pill is a reliable device for Aimee Mann, a singer-songwriter given to ravaging implication and dispassionate affect&quot;. Paul Thomas Anderson wrote that Mann was &quot;the great articulator of the biggest things we think about: &#x27;How can anyone love me?&#x27; &#x27;Why the hell would anyone love me?&#x27; and the old favorite &#x27;Why would I love anyone when all it means is torture?&#x27;&quot;

Many of the lyrics on Mann&#x27;s 90s albums express her frustration with her record label, Geffen. Hornby noted that some found Mann&#x27;s &quot;self-righteous sense of grievance&quot; irritating, such as the author Greil Marcus, who wrote that she was &quot;still whining after all these years&quot;. Hornby responded that pop music could express any mood and asked: &quot;Who doesn&#x27;t feel like whining sometimes?&quot;

=== Influences ===
Mann said she was mainly influenced by &quot;classic&quot; 1970s chord progressions and melodies. Elton John was the artist who was most important to her at an early age: &quot;His melody, the chords, his singing ... There was something in the DNA of his melodic structure that I picked up on later and was influenced by.&quot;

Mann said Steely Dan was &quot;the one band that I 100% love, with no reservations&quot;, and cited Fiona Apple, Leonard Cohen, Stephen Sondheim and Jimmy Webb as artists she admires. The music of Elliott Smith affirmed to her that it was acceptable to write songs about personal or dark subjects. Mann said that American Songbook standards and ragtime had &quot;resonance&quot; for her. Older British bands such as the Kinks, the Zombies and Squeeze influenced her debut album, &quot;Whatever&quot;.

== Personal life ==
According to the musician Al Jourgensen of the band Ministry, he and Mann had a brief &quot;dysfunctional&quot; romance in Boston in the 1970s or 1980s. Mann wrote &quot;No More Crying&quot; about their relationship. Mann had a two-year relationship with the singer-songwriter Jules Shear, and their breakup influenced the final &#x27;Til Tuesday album, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Different Now&quot; (1988). Mann dated the &#x27;Til Tuesday drummer Michael Hausman; after they separated, they remained friends and Hausman became her manager. The actor and comedian Dave Foley said Mann wrote &quot;Save Me&quot; about him while they were in a relationship.

In 1993, while Mann was recording &quot;Whatever&quot;, she met the songwriter Michael Penn, the brother of the actors Sean Penn and Chris Penn. They married in 1997 and live in Los Angeles. Mann said about Penn: &quot;He&#x27;s really a top-rated songwriter for me, and thank God, because how sad is it if you were with another singer-songwriter and you&#x27;re like, &#x27;Yeah, whatever, it&#x27;s not my kind of thing&#x27;?&quot;

In 2008, Mann said she had attended Al-Anon, a support group for the families and friends of alcoholics, to deal with the exhaustion she felt from trying to help addicts she knew. In 2020, she developed a nervous system disorder that gave her tinnitus, migraines, nausea and dizziness and prevented her from listening to music for a year. She believed the disorder was triggered by a combination of childhood trauma and the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>The Confederate States Navy (CSN) was the naval branch of the Confederate States Armed Forces, established by an act of the Confederate States Congress on February 21, 1861. It was responsible for Confederate naval operations during the American Civil War against the United States&#x27;s Union Navy.

The three major tasks of the Confederate States Navy during its existence were the protection of Confederate harbors and coastlines from outside invasion, making the war costly for the United States by attacking its merchant ships worldwide, and running the U.S. blockade by drawing off Union ships in pursuit of Confederate commerce raiders and warships.

It was ineffective in these tasks, as the coastal blockade by the United States Navy reduced trade by the South to 5 percent of its pre-war levels. Additionally, the control of inland rivers and coastal navigation by the US Navy forced the south to overload its limited railroads to the point of failure.

The surrender of the in Liverpool, England, marked the end of the Civil War and the Confederate Navy&#x27;s existence.

==History==
The Confederate Navy could never achieve numerical equality with the Union Navy. It instead sought to take advantage of technological innovation, such as ironclads, submarines, torpedo boats, and naval mines (then known as torpedoes). In February 1861, the Confederate States Navy had 30 vessels, only 14 of which were seaworthy. The opposing Union Navy had 90 vessels. The C. S. Navy eventually grew to 101 ships to meet the rise in naval conflicts and threats to the coast and rivers of the Confederacy.

On April 20, 1861, the U.S. was forced to quickly abandon the important Gosport Navy Yard at Portsmouth, Virginia. In their haste, they failed to effectively burn the facility with its large depots of arms, other supplies, and several small vessels. As a result, the Confederacy captured a large supply of much-needed war materials, including heavy cannon, gunpowder, shot, and shell. Of most importance to the Confederacy was the shipyard&#x27;s dry docks, barely damaged by the departing Union forces. The Confederacy&#x27;s only substantial navy yard at that time was in Pensacola, Florida, so the Gosport Yard was sorely needed to build new warships. The most significant warship left at the Yard was the screw frigate USS &quot;Merrimack&quot;.

The U.S. Navy had torched &quot;Merrimack&quot;&#x27;s superstructure and upper deck, then scuttled the vessel; it would have been immediately useful as a warship to their enemy. Little of the ship&#x27;s structure remained other than the hull, which was holed by the scuttling charge but otherwise intact. Confederate Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory had the idea to raise &quot;Merrimack&quot; and rebuild it. When the hull was raised, it had not been submerged long enough to have been rendered unusable; the steam engines and essential machinery were salvageable. The decks were rebuilt using thick oak and pine planking, and the upper deck was overlaid with two courses of heavy iron plate. The newly rebuilt superstructure was unusual: above the waterline, the sides sloped inward and were covered with two layers of heavy iron-plate armor, the inside course laid horizontally, the outside course laid vertically.

The vessel was a new kind of warship, an all-steam powered &quot;iron-clad&quot;. In the centuries-old tradition of reusing captured ships, the new warship was christened CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;. She later fought the Union&#x27;s new ironclad USS &quot;Monitor&quot;. On the second day of the Battle of Hampton Roads, the two ships met and each scored numerous hits on the other. On the first day of that battle &quot;Virginia&quot;, and the James River Squadron, aggressively attacked and nearly broke the Union Navy&#x27;s sea blockade of wooden warships, proving the effectiveness of the ironclad concept. The two ironclads had steamed forward, tried to outflank or ram the other, circled, backed away, and came forward firing again and again, but neither was able to sink or demand surrender of its opponent. After four hours, both ships were taking on water through split seams and breaches from enemy shot. The engines of both ships were becoming dangerously overtaxed, and their crews were near exhaustion. The two ships turned and steamed away, never to meet again. This part in the Battle of Hampton Roads between &quot;Monitor&quot; and &quot;Virginia&quot; greatly overshadowed the bloody events each side&#x27;s ground troops were fighting, largely because it was the first battle in history between two iron-armored steam-powered warships.

The last Confederate surrender took place in Liverpool, United Kingdom on November 6, 1865, aboard the commerce raider CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; when her flag (battle ensign) was lowered for the final time. This surrender brought about the end of the Confederate navy. The &quot;Shenandoah&quot; had circumnavigated the globe, the only Confederate ship to do so.

===Creation===
The act of the Confederate Congress that created the Confederate Navy on February 21, 1861, also appointed Stephen Mallory as Secretary of the Department of the Navy. Mallory was experienced as an admiralty lawyer and had served for a time as the chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee of the United States Senate. The Confederacy had a few scattered naval assets and looked to Liverpool, England, to buy naval cruisers to attack the American merchant fleet. In April 1861, Mallory recruited former U.S. Navy Lieutenant James Dunwoody Bulloch into the Confederate navy and sent him to Liverpool. Using Charleston-based importer and exporter Fraser Trentholm, who had offices in Liverpool, Commander Bulloch immediately ordered six steam vessels.

As Mallory began aggressively building up a formidable naval force, a Confederate Congress committee on August 27, 1862, reported:

In addition to the ships included in the report of the committee, the C.S. Navy also had one ironclad floating battery, presented to the Confederacy by the state of Georgia, one ironclad ram donated by the state of Alabama, and numerous commerce raiders making war on Union merchant ships. When Virginia seceded the Virginia Navy was absorbed into the Confederate Navy.

===Naval flags===

The practice of using primary and secondary naval flags after the British tradition was common practice for the Confederacy; the fledgling Confederate navy therefore adopted detailed flag requirements and regulations in the use of battle ensigns, naval jacks, as well as small boat ensigns, commissioning pennants, designating flags, and signal flags aboard its warships. Changes to these regulations were made during 1863, when a new naval jack, battle ensign, and commissioning pennant design was introduced aboard all Confederate ships, echoing the Confederacy″s change of its national flag from the old &quot;Stars and Bars&quot; to the new &quot;Stainless Banner&quot;. Despite the detailed naval regulations issued, minor variations in the flags were frequently seen, due to different manufacturing techniques employed, suppliers used, and the flag-making traditions of each southern state.

===Privateers===

On April 17, 1861, Confederate President Jefferson Davis invited applications for letters of marque and reprisal to be granted under the seal of the Confederate States, against ships and property of the United States and their citizens:

President Davis was not confident of his executive authority to issue letters of marque and called a special session of Congress on April 29 to formally authorize the hiring of privateers in the name of the Confederate States. On 6 May the Confederate Congress passed &quot;An act recognizing the existence of war between the United States and the Confederate States, and concerning letters of marque, prizes, and prize goods.&quot; Then, on May 14, 1861, &quot;An act regulating the sale of prizes and the distribution thereof,&quot; was also passed. Both acts granted the president power to issue letters of marque and detailed regulations as to the conditions on which letters of marque should be granted to private vessels, the conduct and behavior of the officers and crews of such vessels, and the disposal of such prizes made by privateer crews. The manner in which Confederate privateers operated was generally similar to those of privateers of the United States or of European nations.

The 1856 Declaration of Paris outlawed privateering for such nations as the United Kingdom and France, but the United States had neither signed nor endorsed the declaration. Therefore, privateering was constitutionally legal in both the United States and the Confederacy, as well as Portugal, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and Germany. However, the United States did not acknowledge the Confederacy as an independent country and denied the legitimacy of any letters of marque issued by its government. U.S. President Abraham Lincoln declared all medicines to the Confederacy to be contraband and any captured Confederate privateers were to be hanged as pirates. Ultimately, no one was hanged for privateering because the Confederate government threatened to retaliate against U.S. prisoners of war.

Initially, Confederate privateers operated primarily from New Orleans, but activity was soon concentrated in the Atlantic, as the Union Navy began expanding its operations. Confederate privateers harassed Union merchant ships and sank several warships, although they were unable to relieve the blockade on Southern ports and its dire effects on the Confederate economy.

==Ships==


In May 1861, Confederate Congress appropriated $2,000,000 to either construct or purchase ironclad vessels in England. The Confederacy intended to use the European ironclads to break the Union blockade. Aside from those built in Europe, the Confederacy also manufactured their own vessels. Despite a lack of materials (especially iron and engines) and shipbuilding facilities, the Confederacy was able to construct at least twenty ironclads that were commissioned and put into operation during the war.

One of the more well-known ships was the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, formerly the sloop-of-war USS &quot;Merrimack&quot; (1855). In 1862, after being converted to an ironclad ram, she fought USS &quot;Monitor&quot; in the Battle of Hampton Roads, an event that came to symbolize the end of the dominance of large wooden sailing warships and the beginning of the age of steam and the ironclad warship.

The Confederates also constructed submarines, among the few that existed after the early &quot;Turtle&quot; of the American Revolutionary War. Of those the &quot;Pioneer&quot; and the Bayou St. John submarine never saw action. However, &quot;Hunley&quot;, built in Mobile as a privateer by Horace Hunley, later came under the control of the Confederate Army at Charleston, SC, but was manned partly by a C. S. Navy crew; she became the first submarine to sink a ship in a wartime engagement.

The &quot;Hunley&quot; later sank the sloop-of-war , resulting from the large blastwave that traveled from its exploding spar torpedo&#x27;s 500-pound black powder charge, during the sinking of USS Housatonic. The sinking of the Housatonic became the first successful submarine attack in history.

Confederate Navy commerce raiders were also used with great success to disrupt U.S. merchant shipping. The most famous of them was the screw sloop-of-war CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;, a warship secretly built for the Confederacy in Birkenhead, near Liverpool, United Kingdom. She was launched as &quot;Enrica&quot; but was commissioned as CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; just off the Azores by her captain, Raphael Semmes. She began her world-famous raiding career under his command, accounting for 65 U.S. ships, a record that still remains unbeaten by any ship in naval warfare. CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; ″s crew was mostly from Liverpool, and the cruiser never once dropped anchor in a Confederate port, though she sank a blockading Union gunboat off the coast of Texas. She was sunk in June 1864 by at the Battle of Cherbourg outside the port of Cherbourg, France.

A similar raider, CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, fired the last shot of the American Civil War in late June 1865; she did not strike her colors and surrender until early November 1865, in Liverpool, England five months after the conflict had ended.

==Organization==
Between the beginning of the war and the end of 1861, 373 commissioned officers, warrant officers, and midshipmen had resigned or been dismissed from the United States Navy and had gone on to serve the Confederacy. The Provisional Congress meeting in Montgomery accepted these men into the Confederate Navy at their old rank. In order to accommodate them they initially provided for an officer corps to consist of four captains, four commanders, 30 lieutenants, and various other non-line officers. On 21 April 1862, the First Congress expanded this to four admirals, ten captains, 31 commanders, 100 first lieutenants, 25 second lieutenants, and 20 masters in line of promotion; additionally, there were to be 12 paymasters, 40 assistant paymasters, 22 surgeons, 15 passed assistant surgeons, 30 assistant surgeons, one engineer-in-chief, and 12 engineers. The act also provided for promotion on merit: &quot;All the Admirals, four of the Captains, five of the Commanders, twenty-two of the First Lieutenants, and five of the Second Lieutenants, shall be appointed solely for gallant or meritorious conduct during the war.&quot;

===Administration===
The Department of the Navy was responsible for the administration of the affairs of the Confederate Navy and Confederate Marine Corps. It included various offices, bureaus, and naval agents in Europe.

By July 20, 1861, the Confederate government had organized the administrative positions of the Confederate navy as follows:
* Stephen R. Mallory – Secretary of the Navy
* Commodore Samuel Barron – Chief of the Bureau of Orders and Detail
* Commander George Minor – Chief of Ordnance and Hydrography
* Paymaster John DeBree – Chief of Provisions and Clothing
* Surgeon W. A. W. Spottswood – Bureau of Medicine and Surgery
* Edward M. Tidball – Chief Clerk

==Notable engagements==
* Battle of Cherbourg
* Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip
* First Battle of Memphis
* Battle of Mobile Bay
* Battle of Hampton Roads
* Bahia incident
* Battle of the Head of Passes
* Siege of Fort Pulaski
* Battle of Plum Point Bend
* Action off Galveston Light
* Battle of Elizabeth City

==Ranks==

By 1862 regulations specified the uniforms and rank insignia for officers. Petty officers wore a variety of uniforms, or even regular clothing.

===Officers===
Officers of the Confederate States Navy used, just like the army, a combination of several rank insignias to indicate their rank. While both hat insignia and sleeve insignia were used here the primary indicator were shoulder straps. Only line officers wore those straps shown below as officers of various staff departments (Medical, Pay, Engineering and Naval Construction) had separate ranks and different straps. Likewise the anchor symbol on the hats was substituted accordingly and they did not wear loops on the sleeve insignias.

Paymasters, surgeons and chief engineers of more than twelve year&#x27;s standing ranked with commanders. Paymasters, surgeons and chief engineers of less than twelve year&#x27;s standing ranked with lieutenants. Assistant paymasters ranked with masters during the first five years of service, then with lieutenants. Passed assistant surgeons and professors ranked with masters. Assistant surgeons, first assistant engineers and secretaries to commanders of squadrons ranked with passed midshipmen. Second and third assistant engineers and clerks to commanding officers and paymasters ranked as midshipmen.

<text>The Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN) is a Canadian performance rights organization that represents the performing rights of more than 175,000 songwriters, composers and music publishers. The organization collects license fees through a music licensing program approved by the Copyright Board of Canada.

==History==
SOCAN is a result of a merger that took place in 1990 between the Composers, Authors and Publishers Association of Canada (CAPAC) and the Performing Rights Organization of Canada (PROCAN).

In 2013, Front Row Insurance Brokers Inc. initiated an online musical instrument insurance program for members of various Canadian music associations, including SOCAN.

In May 2016, SOCAN acquired the Seattle-based company Medianet Digital for an undisclosed amount; the organization planned to leverage the company&#x27;s software and database of rights metadata to assist in the calculation and distribution of royalties for works on digital music streaming services. In July 2016, SOCAN acquired Audiam, a U.S. startup created by TuneCore founder Jeff Price that specializes in managing the distribution of royalties for songs used on digital services such as YouTube, using a database of song recordings and metadata for identification.

In July 2019, SOCAN partnered with Re:Sound to launch Entandem, a single online portal to collect both copyright and neighbouring rights royalties.

<text>A blockade is the act of actively preventing a country or region from receiving or sending out food, supplies, weapons, or communications, and sometimes people, by military force.
A blockade differs from an embargo or sanction, which are legal barriers to trade rather than physical barriers. It is also distinct from a siege in that a blockade is usually directed at an entire country or region, rather than a fortress or city and the objective may not always be to conquer the area.

A blockading power can seek to cut off all maritime transport from and to the blockaded country, although stopping all land transport to and from an area may also be considered a blockade. Blockades restrict the trading rights of neutrals, who must submit for inspection for contraband, which the blockading power may define narrowly or broadly, sometimes including food and medicine. In the 20th century, air power has also been used to enhance the effectiveness of blockades by halting air traffic within the blockaded airspace.

Close patrol of hostile ports, in order to prevent naval forces from putting to sea, is also referred to as a blockade. When coastal cities or fortresses were besieged from the landward side, the besiegers would often blockade the seaward side as well. Most recently, blockades have sometimes included cutting off electronic communications by jamming radio signals and severing undersea cables. Blockades often result in the starvation of the civilian population, notably during the blockade of Germany during World War I and the blockade of Biafra during the Nigerian Civil War.

According to modern international law, blockades are an act of war. When used as a part of an effort to starve the civilian population, they are illegal as part of a war of aggression or when used against a civilian population, instead of a military target. In such case, they are a war crime and potentially a crime against humanity.

==History==
Although primitive naval blockades had been in use for millennia, they were limited by the time ships were able to stay at sea uninterruptedly. The first successful attempts at establishing a full naval blockade were made by the British Royal Navy during the Seven Years&#x27; War (1754–1763) against France. Following the British naval victory at Quiberon Bay, which ended any immediate threat of a major invasion of Britain, Britain established a close blockade on the French coast. This starved French ports of commerce, weakening France&#x27;s economy. Admiral Edward Hawke took command of the blockading fleet off Brest and extended the blockade to cover the entire French Atlantic coast from Dunkirk to Bordeaux, and also to Marseille on France&#x27;s Mediterranean coast.

The strategic importance of blockade was shown during the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, when the Royal Navy successfully blockaded France, leading to major economic disruptions. The Union blockade of southern ports was a major factor in the American Civil War. During World War I, the Allies blockaded the Central Powers, depriving them of food and other strategic materials. Germany&#x27;s attempted U-boat blockade caused some shortages in Britain, but ultimately failed. This outcome was repeated in World War II.

Naval strategic thinkers, such as Sir Julian Corbett and Alfred Thayer Mahan, wrote that naval conflicts were won primarily by decisive battles, but also by blockade.

==Types of blockade==

===Close, distant, and loose blockades===
A &quot;close&quot; blockade entails placing warships within sight of the blockaded coast or port, to ensure the immediate interception of any ship entering or leaving. It is both the most effective and the most difficult form of blockade to implement. Difficulties arise because the blockading ships must remain continuously at sea, exposed to storms and hardship, usually far from any support, and vulnerable to sudden attack from the blockaded side, whose ships may stay safe in harbor until they choose to come out.
In a &quot;distant&quot; blockade, the blockaders stay well away from the blockaded coast and try to intercept any ships going in or out. This may require more ships on station, but they can usually operate closer to their bases, and are at much less risk from enemy raids. This was almost impossible prior to the 16th century due to the nature of the ships used.

A &quot;loose&quot; blockade is a close blockade where the blockading ships are withdrawn out of sight from the coast (behind the horizon) but no farther. The object of loose blockade is to lure the enemy into venturing out but to stay close enough to strike.

British admiral Horatio Nelson applied a loose blockade at Cádiz in 1805. The Franco-Spanish fleet under Pierre-Charles Villeneuve then came out, resulting in the Battle of Trafalgar.

===Pacific blockade===
Until 1827, blockades, as part of economic warfare, were always a part of a war. This changed when France, Russia and Britain came to the aid of the Greek rebels against Turkey. They blockaded the Turkish-occupied coast, which led to the battle of Navarino. War was never declared, however, so it is considered the first &quot;pacific&quot; — i.e. peaceful — blockade. The first truly pacific blockade, involving no shooting at all, was the British blockade of the Republic of New Granada in 1837, established to compel New Granada to release an imprisoned British consul.

==Legal status==
Since 1945, the United Nations Security Council determines the legal status of blockades and by article 42 of the UN Charter, the council can also apply blockades. The UN Charter allows for the right of self-defense but requires that this must be immediately reported to the Security Council to ensure the maintenance of international peace.

According to the not ratified document San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, 12 June 1994, a blockade is a legal method of warfare at sea but is governed by rules. The manual describes what can never be contraband. The blockading nation is free to select anything else as contraband in a list, which it must publish.

The blockading nation typically establishes a blockaded area of water, but any ship can be inspected as soon as it is established that it is attempting to break the blockade. This inspection can occur inside the blockaded area or in international waters, but never inside the territorial waters of a neutral nation. A neutral ship must obey a request to stop for inspection from the blockading nation. If the situation so demands, the blockading nation can request that the ship divert to a known place or harbour for inspection. If the ship does not stop, then the ship is subject to capture. If people aboard the ship resist capture, they can be lawfully attacked.

===Act of war===
Whether or not a blockade was seen as lawful depended on the laws of the nations whose trade was influenced by the blockade. The Brazilian blockade of Río de la Plata in 1826 during the Cisplatine War, for instance, was considered lawful according to British law but unlawful according to French and American law. The latter two countries announced they would actively defend their ships against Brazilian blockaders, while Britain was forced to steer for a peaceful solution between Brazil and Argentina.

== Blockade planning ==

Blockades depend on four general factors

* The value of the item being blockaded must warrant the need to blockade. For example, during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the items to be blockaded (or &quot;quarantined&quot; to use the more neutral term selected by President John F. Kennedy) were Medium-range ballistic missiles, capable of delivering nuclear weaponry, bound for Cuba. Their value was high, as a military threat against the United States.
* The strength of the blockading force must be equal to or greater in strength than the opposition. The blockade is only successful if the &#x27;thing&#x27; in question is prevented from reaching its receiver. For example, the overwhelming power of the Royal Navy allowed a successful blockade of Germany during and after World War I.
* Geography. Knowing the routes of the enemy will help the blockader choose where to blockade: for example, a high mountain pass or a strait is a natural choke point and a candidate for fortification.
* A blockade tends to be a long campaign requiring a long-term commitment by the blockading power. The Atlantic U-boat campaign of World War I and Battle of the Atlantic were essentially about German blockades, and lasted nearly as long as their respective wars. The Imperial Japanese Navy, however, made only sporadic efforts at blockade during the Pacific war, preferring to seek victory by fleet action.

==Blockade running==
Blockade running is the practice of delivering cargo (food, for example) to a blockaded area. It has mainly been done by ships (called blockade runners) across ports under naval blockade. Blockade runners were typically the fastest ships available and often lightly armed and armored. It is now also been done by aircraft, forming airbridges, such as over the Berlin Blockade after World War II.

<text>PRS for Music Limited (formerly The MCPS-PRS Alliance Limited) is a British music copyright collective, made up of two collection societies: the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society (MCPS) and the Performing Right Society (PRS). It undertakes collective rights management for musical works on behalf of its 175,000 members. PRS for Music was formed in 1997 following the MCPS-PRS Alliance. In 2009, PRS and MCPS-PRS Alliance realigned their brands and became PRS for Music.

PRS represents their songwriter, composer and music publisher members’ performing rights, and collects royalties on their behalf whenever their music is played or performed publicly.

MCPS also represents songwriters, composers and music publishers – representing their mechanical rights, and collects royalties whenever their music is reproduced as a physical product – this includes CDs, DVDs, digital downloads and broadcast or online.

PRS (Performing Right Society) and MCPS (Mechanical Copyright Protection Society) are two separate collection societies with PRS running its own operations, providing services to MCPS under the name PRS for Music. As of 2018 PRS has entered a joint venture with Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL) under a newly formed private company called PPL PRS Ltd with the aim of making it easier for their customers to obtain a music licence.

==History==
The Performing Right Society was founded in 1914 by a group of music publishers, to protect the value of copyright and to help provide an income for composers, songwriters and music publishers. At the time, PRS collected fees for live performance from sheet music.

PRS was distinct from both the activities of the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society which was founded in 1910, and the Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL), founded in 1934 by Decca and EMI.

The Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society began as Mecolico, the Mechanical Copyright Licenses Company, which was founded in 1910 in anticipation of the Copyright Act of 1911. Mecolico licensed the mechanical rights within musical works and merged with the Copyright Protection Society in 1924. Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL) collected fees for playing gramophone recordings.

Another agency, the British Copyright Protection Company or Britico was founded in 1932 by Alphonse Tournier, specialising on collecting royalties in the UK on French and German musical copyright, and becoming the British Copyright Protection Association in 1962. This company, Britico, started to share computer facilities with PRS in 1970.

==Tariffs==
PRS for Music administers the performance rights and mechanical rights of about 41 million musical works on behalf of its songwriters, composers and publishing members and in 2018 processed over 11.1 trillion uses of music. PRS for Music licenses and collects royalties for its members&#x27; musical works whenever they are publicly performed, or recordings of them are broadcast, streamed online or played in public spaces, both in the UK and globally through its partner network.

After operating costs are deducted, the remaining money is distributed to PRS for Music&#x27;s songwriter, composer and publisher members and to affiliate societies.

The principal sources of PRS for Music revenue collection are broadcasting (i.e. radio and television channels), public performance (i.e. music at gigs, concerts, theatres, restaurants, retailers and workplaces), online (i.e. music streamed online, digitally downloaded), and international.

PRS for Music also has a number of tariffs for organisations in different sectors (businesses, government organisations, educational establishments, and so on). Dependent on their size and the extent to which each premises uses music, whether they are commercial premises or not, as well as other criteria, PRS for Music&#x27;s tariffs vary.

Around 350,000 UK businesses have paid and are licensed to play music under a PRS for Music licence, however some workplaces do not need one:

* Inpatient and treatment areas in hospitals
* Medical day centres
* Residential homes (in most circumstances)
* Music used in divine worship (although licences are required for copyrighted music)
* Civil wedding ceremonies and partnership ceremonies
* Lone and home workers.

In 2018, PPL and PRS for Music formed a jointly owned subsidiary, PPL PRS Ltd, to collect all licence fees for public performances. PPL PRS Ltd is based in Leicester, England.

== Initiatives ==
===ICE – Global Licensing Hub===

In July 2015, PRS for Music, Sweden collecting society STIM and German collecting society GEMA announced the completion of a joint venture to launch an integrated multi-territory music licensing and processing hub covering European territories. In November 2015, it was confirmed the new hub would be called &#x27;ICE&#x27;.

===PRS for Music and PPL joint venture for public performance licensing===

In February 2016, PRS for Music and PPL, the body who licenses the sound recording of a song, confirmed plans to create a new joint venture for public performance licensing. The new joint venture would focus on servicing all UK public performance licensing customers. The joint venture launched in 2018.

===Streamfair===

In July 2015, PRS for Music launched a pro-creator campaign called Streamfair. The campaign focused on four areas, Copyright Legislation, Online Licensing, Promoting the value of music creators and education. The campaign was supported by acclaimed songwriters and composers including Jimmy Napes, Michael Price, Crispin Hunt, Gary Clark and Debbie Wiseman.

===Heritage Awards===

The PRS for Music Heritage Award scheme launched in 2009 with the first award going to Blur. Ceremonial plaques are unveiled to honour the performance birthplaces of legendary bands, artists and songwriters - as well as recognising the network of pubs, clubs and live music venues. Those honoured include Squeeze, Elton John, Pulp, Queen and UB40.

== Financial information ==
In May 2016, PRS for Music announced its 2015 financial results, which showed an 8.4% increase in distributions to its songwriter members. The figures for 2016 were announced in May 2017 showing that revenues increased by 10.1% and royalty payments to its members increased to £527.6 m (up 11.1%). The organisation reported record royalty distributions in 2017, with a payout of £605.1 m (up 14.7%). 
==Licensing==

===Legal cases===
In 2007, PRS for Music took a Scottish car servicing company to court because the employees were allegedly &quot;listening to the radio at work, allowing the music to be &#x27;heard by colleagues and customers&#x27;. In June 2008, PRS for Music accused Lancashire Constabulary of playing music at police stations not covered by a license, and sought an injunction and payments for damages.

In 2014, PRS for Music and commercial broadcaster ITV failed to negotiate a licensing deal resulting in a Copyright Tribunal dispute. In July 2016, The Copyright Tribunal awarded in favour of PRS for Music. ITV appealed and subsequently lost a High Court appeal in early 2017.

In 2015, PRS for Music entered into a licensing agreement with the Berlin-based company SoundCloud after several months of litigation. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

===Cross-border European licensing===
The Santiago Agreement was established in 2000 between five European collecting societies including the UK&#x27;s PRS for Music, France&#x27;s SACEM, and Germany&#x27;s GEMA. The agreement allows each collecting society to collect royalties on behalf of members of the other collecting society, e.g. PRS for Music would collect money for German artists listed with GEMA, but to restrict licences to be sold only within the member organisation&#x27;s home country.

The European Commission decided in 2008 that the cross-licensing agreements formed by 24 collecting societies in Europe were in violation of anti-competition laws.

===Schools===
Along with Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL), PRS for Music use the Centre for Education and Finance Management (CEFM) as agents to collect licensing money from schools and colleges. Universities have separate arrangements.

===Enforcement===
In 2008, PRS for Music began a concerted drive to make commercial premises pay for annual &quot;performance&quot; licences. In one case it told a 61-year-old mechanic that he would have to pay £150 to play his radio while he worked by himself.
It also targeted a bakery that played a radio in a private room at the back of the shop,
a woman who used a classical radio to calm her horses and community centres that allowed children to sing carols in public. However, questions have been raised about the tactic of targeting small businesses:

Radio stations pay large amounts of money to licensing organizations PRS and PPL for the music they play, and music has been on the radio for many years. During the war, there were programmes like Workers Playtime and Music While You Work. Now, many radio stations have features about workplaces. If the PRS force people to switch their radios off then how are these stations going to survive? Music has to be heard before people go out and buy it.
:—&quot;The Bolton News&quot;
In March 2009, the on line video-sharing site YouTube removed all premium music videos for UK users, even those supplied by record labels, due to a failure to find &quot;mutually acceptable terms for a new licence&quot; with PRS for Music. As a consequence, PRS for Music established the Fair Play for Creators campaign in order to provide a forum where musicians could &quot;publicly demonstrate their concern over the way their work is treated by online businesses&quot;. David Arnold, Jazzie B, Billy Bragg, Guy Chambers, Robin Gibb, Pete Waterman, Mike Chapman, Wayne Hector, Pam Sheyne and Debbie Wiseman sent a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in support of the campaign launched by PRS for Music. A rights deal was settled in September 2009 between PRS for Music and Google that allowed YouTube users in UK to view music videos.

Wiltshire Constabulary refused to pay PRS for Music for a £32,000 licence fee in April 2009. Instead the force told all officer and civilian staff that music could no longer be played in their workplaces but that ban excluded patrol cars. A total of 38 of 49 UK police forces currently hold PRS for Music licences.

In May 2009, the British Chambers of Commerce published a survey of business attitudes to PRS for Music. Just 6% of companies rated their experience as good or excellent. In contrast, over half said their experience had been poor or very poor. Businesses were also asked to submit comments about their experiences. Many of these replies referred to the PRS for Music&#x27;s behaviour as &quot;aggressive&quot; and &quot;threatening&quot;.

In October 2009, PRS for Music apologised to a 56-year-old shelf-stacker at a village in Clackmannanshire for pursuing her for singing to herself while stacking shelves. PRS for Music initially told her that she would be prosecuted and fined thousands of pounds if she continued to sing without a &quot;live performance&quot; licence. However PRS for Music subsequently acknowledged its mistake.

In October 2010, it was reported that Sussex Police, in a money-saving move, were not intending to renew their PRS for Music licence, meaning that police officers would no longer be able to listen to the radio in their squad cars or other work places.

== Independent Welsh agency ==
In 2012, a high per centage of Welsh-language musicians left PRS for Music to form a separate agency, &quot;Eos&quot; (Welsh for nightingale), after changes in the way PRS for Music calculates royalties led to a fifteen-fold decrease in payments. In 2007, PRS for Music had reclassified Welsh-language station BBC Radio Cymru as a local station, where previously it had been considered a national station. This led to a decrease in royalty rates from £7.50 per minute to 50p per minute of broadcast music. The English-language sister station, BBC Radio Wales, is classified by PRS for Music as a national station and attracts the higher rates.

As of December 2012, Eos is in negotiations with the BBC, whose Welsh-language service is highly dependent on its members&#x27; output. From 1 January 2013, a PRS licence will not be required to play such music, and will not give any permission to do so.

<doc id="293065" wikidata="Q13221746" url="?curid=293065" title="Desiccant">
<text>A desiccant is a hygroscopic substance that is used to induce or sustain a state of dryness (desiccation) in its vicinity; it is the opposite of a humectant. Commonly encountered pre-packaged desiccants are solids that absorb water. Desiccants for specialized purposes may be in forms other than solid, and may work through other principles, such as chemical bonding of water molecules. They are commonly encountered in foods to retain crispness. Industrially, desiccants are widely used to control the level of water in gas streams.

==Types of desiccants==
Although some desiccants are chemically inert, others are extremely reactive and require specialized handling techniques. The most common desiccant is silica gel, an otherwise inert, nontoxic, water-insoluble white solid. Tens of thousands of tons are produced annually for this purpose. Other common desiccants include activated charcoal, calcium sulfate, calcium chloride, and molecular sieves (typically, zeolites). Desiccants may also be categorized by their type, either I, II, III, IV, or V. These types are a function of the shape of the desiccant&#x27;s moisture sorption isotherm.

Alcohols and acetones are also dehydrating agents. Diethylene glycol is an important industrial desiccant. It absorbs water from natural gas, minimizing the formation of methane hydrates, which can block pipes.

=== Performance efficiency ===
One measure of desiccant efficiency is the ratio (or percentage) of water storable in the desiccant relative to the mass of desiccant. Another measure is the residual relative humidity of the air or other fluid being dried. For drying gases, a desiccant&#x27;s performance can be precisely described by the dew point of the dried product.

===Colored saturation indicators===
Sometimes a humidity indicator is included in the desiccant to show, by color changes, the degree of water-saturation of the desiccant. One commonly used indicator is cobalt chloride (), which is blue when anhydrous, but turns purple upon bonding with two water molecules (·2). Further hydration results in the pink hexaaquacobalt(II) chloride complex . However, the use of cobalt chloride raises health concerns, being potentially carcinogenic.

==Applications==
Applications of desiccants are dominated by the petrochemical industry. Hydrocarbons, including natural gas, often must be anhydrous or nearly so for processing or for transport. Catalysts that are used to convert some petroleum fractions are generally deactivated by even traces of water. Natural gas tends to form solid methane hydrates which can block pipes.

===Domestic uses===
One example of desiccant usage is in the manufacture of insulated windows where zeolite spheroids fill a rectangular spacer tube at the perimeter of the panes of glass. The desiccant helps to prevent the condensation of moisture between the panes. Another use of zeolites is in the &quot;dryer&quot; component of refrigeration systems to absorb water carried by the refrigerant, whether residual water left over from the construction of the system, or water released by the degradation of other materials over time.

Bagged desiccants are also commonly used to protect goods in barrier-sealed shipping containers against moisture damage: rust, corrosion, etc. Hygroscopic cargo, such as cocoa, coffee, various nuts and grains, and other foods can be particularly susceptible to mold and rot when exposed to condensation and humidity. Because of this, shippers often take measures by deploying desiccants to protect against loss. Pharmaceutical packaging often includes small packets of desiccant to keep the atmosphere inside the package below critical levels of water vapor.

Air conditioning systems can be based on desiccants, as drier air feels more comfortable and absorbing water itself removes heat.

Desiccants are used in livestock farming, where, for example, new-born piglets are highly susceptible to hypothermia owing to their wetness.

===Laboratory uses===
Desiccants are also used to remove water from solvents. Drying generally involves mixing the solvent with the solid desiccant. Molecular sieves are superior as desiccants relative to chemical drying reagents such as sodium-benzophenone. Sieves offer the advantages of being safe in air and recyclable.

<text>Crossfade is an American rock band formed in Columbia, South Carolina, in 1991. Before settling on the Crossfade name in 2002, the band had previously existed under the names The Nothing and Sugardaddy Superstar. Their current lineup includes lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Ed Sloan, bassist and backing vocalist Mitch James and lead guitarist, keyboardist, and backing vocalist Les Hall. Since their formation, Crossfade has released three studio albums – their self-titled debut album in 2004, &quot;Falling Away&quot; in 2006, and &quot;We All Bleed&quot; in 2011.

== History ==
=== Early years, &quot;Crossfade&quot; and &quot;Falling Away&quot; (1991–2007) ===
Crossfade was formed in 1991, originally under the name The Nothing. The band consisted of Ed Sloan on lead vocals and guitar, and Mitch James on bass and backing vocals, later being joined by Brian Geiger on drums in 1992, and DJ Tony Byroads on percussion and backup vocals in 1996. They released two records, &quot;The Nothing&quot; (1994) and &quot;Numb&quot; (1998). The song &quot;Breathing Slowly&quot;, originally from &quot;Numb&quot;, was re-recorded eight years later on &quot;Falling Away&quot;. By 1999, The Nothing had changed their name to Sugardaddy Superstar. The band recorded songs in the &quot;Sugardaddy Studio&quot;, a studio that lead singer Ed Sloan had built in his garage. The songs eventually attracted the interest of the Los Angeles A&amp;R company Taxi (Independent A&amp;R), and HitPredictor co-founder and FG Records/Earshot head Doug Ford which ultimately led to the signing of a record deal with the FG Records/Earshot division of Columbia Records.

In 2002, they changed their name once again, this time to Crossfade. That year the band entered the studio to record two more songs to add to the eight they had recorded in the &quot;Sugardaddy Studio&quot; for their debut album. Brian Geiger left the band before the album was released, and was replaced by James Branham. They released their first album, &quot;Crossfade,&quot; on April 13, 2004. The first single off the album, &quot;Cold&quot;, gave the band significant mainstream exposure. Two singles followed afterward in 2005: &quot;So Far Away&quot; and &quot;Colors&quot;. In February 2005, their &quot;Crossfade&quot; album was certified Gold by the RIAA and was later certified Platinum in August 2005. Crossfade had with &quot;So Far Away&quot; their debut radio broadcast on 94.5 the Buzz (Houston, Texas) Cage Match at 10 o&#x27;clock p.m. where it competed with a new song every night and won out over the competition for over three weeks. At the time, Crossfade&#x27;s single had been the longest lasting song on the Cage Match since its founding. That year, Tony Byroads left the band after a religious experience, and rising tensions regarding creative differences amongst himself and Ed Sloan.

After coming off the success of their first album, the band began to write a follow-up. Crossfade&#x27;s second album, &quot;Falling Away,&quot; was released on August 29, 2006. The album spawned three singles: &quot;Invincible&quot;, &quot;Drown You Out&quot;, and &quot;Already Gone&quot;. After releasing the album, they needed another guitarist for their upcoming tour. Les Hall, an old friend of Ed Sloan, filled the position. After touring, Hall wanted to become an official member of the band and he asked if he could take part in the songwriting. Sloan accepted and Les Hall became Crossfade&#x27;s lead guitarist and keyboardist. Though their debut album sold over one million copies, &quot;Falling Away&quot; only sold 200,000.

=== New label, switching drummers, &quot;We All Bleed&quot; and return (2008–present) ===
In 2008, the band was dropped from Columbia Records. The band signed with Eleven Seven Music. After drummer James Branham left and formed a new band, A Fall From Down, he was replaced by temporary member Will Hunt for the recording of the album.

On January 2, 2009, Crossfade released a demo track entitled &quot;We All Bleed&quot;. It was announced that they would be releasing a new album later that year. According to the band, the new album would have a darker, and possibly different, sound than their previous releases.

In June 2010, the track listing for &quot;We All Bleed&quot; was revealed, and the first single, &quot;Killing Me Inside&quot;, was released along with a music video. The release date for &quot;We All Bleed&quot; was originally October 26, 2010, but was pushed back first to January 2011, then April 12, 2011, before being pushed back a third time to June 21, 2011. The album closer track &quot;Make Me A Believer&quot; was made available for download for free in the meantime, which is the longest song the band has ever recorded. Around that time after the album was finished recording, studio drummer Will Hunt became the drummer of American rock band, Evanescence, with whom he toured in 2007.

In November 2010, Crossfade announced on their YouTube channel, CrossfadeMusicTV, that Mark Castillo from the metalcore band Bury Your Dead would be the band&#x27;s new drummer.

The same day that the first single &quot;Killing Me Inside&quot; was officially released to digital retailers, the band announced on their Twitter that the album would finally be released on June 21, 2011. In November, the band also released the second single, &quot;Prove You Wrong&quot;, and released the music video for the song in December.

In 2011, Crossfade headlined Rockapalooza in Jackson, Michigan.

Crossfade supported Papa Roach and Buckcherry on the Rock Allegiance Tour in 2011 with Puddle of Mudd, P.O.D., Red, and Drive A.

In January 2012, drummer Mark Castillo announced on his Facebook that he had left Crossfade to pursue a career in the metalcore band Emmure.

Despite a lengthy period of inactivity, the band had not broken up as of August 2016. Sloan took to Facebook to address rumors of the band&#x27;s demise in the meantime.

In October 2017, Ed Sloan stated on Facebook that an upcoming solo album was underway and that its debut single &quot;Surrender&quot;, would be released on November 10. An acoustic version of &quot;Surrender&quot; was later released. On February 2, 2018, Ed released his second solo single titled &quot;Alive&quot;. An official music video was released a month later. On March 30, 2018, Ed released his third solo single titled &quot;Without You&quot;. Sloan hasn’t posted to social media since 2019. In 2024, Crossfade announced their first two shows since 2011 will be at Sonic Temple and Inkcarceration 2025.

<doc id="293072" wikidata="Q13248" url="?curid=293072" title="Upper Sorbian language">
<text>Upper Sorbian (), occasionally referred to as Wendish (), is a minority language spoken by Sorbs, in the historical province of Upper Lusatia, which is today part of Saxony, Germany. It is grouped in the West Slavic language branch, together with Lower Sorbian, Czech, Polish, Silesian, Slovak, and Kashubian. By now the dialect&#x27;s speaking area mostly shrank to Budyšin and its immediate countryside, and is spoken by less than 10,000 people.

==History==
The history of the Upper Sorbian language in Germany began with the Slavic migrations during the 6th century AD. Beginning in the 12th century, there was a massive influx of rural Germanic settlers from Flanders, Saxony, Thuringia and Franconia. This so-called &quot;&quot; (eastern settlement or expansion) led to a slow but steady decline in use of the Sorbian language. In addition, in the Saxony region, the Sorbian language was legally subordinated to the German language. Language prohibitions were later added: In 1293, the Sorbian language was forbidden in Berne castle before the courts; in 1327 it was forbidden in Zwickau and Leipzig, and from 1424 on it was forbidden in Meissen. Further, there was the condition in many guilds of the cities of the area to accept only members of German-language origin.

However, the central areas of the Milzener and Lusitzer, in the area of today&#x27;s Lusatia, were relatively unaffected by the new German language settlements and legal restrictions. The language therefore flourished there. By the 17th century, the number of Sorbian speakers in that area grew to over 300,000. The oldest evidence of written Upper Sorbian is the &quot;Burger Eydt Wendisch&quot; document, which was discovered in the city of Bautzen and dates to the year 1532.

==Upper Sorbian in Germany==

There are an estimated 18,000 speakers of Upper Sorbian. Almost all of these live in the state of Saxony, chiefly in the district of Bautzen (Budyšin). The stronghold of the language is the village of Crostwitz (Chrósćicy) and the surrounding municipalities, especially to the west of it. In this core area, Upper Sorbian remains the predominant vernacular. In this area, Sorbian is an official language and children are taught Sorbian in schools and day cares. Other concerted efforts to preserve the language through media, club, and related resources have continued into the 21st century. In spite of these efforts, numbers of Upper Sorbian speakers were still considered to be dwindling. It has been suggested that this may be in part because of a lack of understanding of the benefits of bilingualism.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
The vowel inventory of Upper Sorbian is exactly the same as that of Lower Sorbian.

* Word-initial vowels are rare, and are often preceded by a non-phonemic glottal stop , or sometimes . appear in word-initial position only in recent borrowings, whereas the diphthongs never occur in this position.
* The near-close can also be analyzed as diphthongs . Here, they are analyzed as monophthongs.
* The diphthongal allophones of are falling: . occurs only under strong sentence stress in monosyllabic words. Conversely, is a more common realization of than .
* has three allophones:
** Open-mid between hard consonants and after a hard consonant;
** Mid between soft consonants and after a soft consonant (excluding in both cases);
** Diphthong with a mid onset before .
* has two allophones:
** Diphthong with a mid onset before labial consonants;
** Open-mid in all other cases.
* Additional diphthongs arise from r-vocalization, as in German. For instance, &#x27;University&#x27; may be pronounced .
* The distinction between on the one hand and on the other is weakened or lost in unstressed syllables.
* is phonetically central . It is somewhat higher after soft consonants.

===Consonants===
* are bilabial, whereas are labiodental.
** are strongly palatalized.
** is a somewhat velarized bilabial approximant , whereas is a strongly palatalized bilabial approximant .
** is very rare. Apart from loanwords, it occurs only in two Slavonic words: &quot;zełharny&quot; &#x27;deceitful&#x27; and &quot;zełharnosć&quot; &#x27;deceitfulness&#x27;, both of which are derivatives of &quot;łhać&quot; &#x27;to lie&#x27;. Usage of these words is typically restricted to the Bautzen dialect, as speakers of the Catholic dialect use &quot;łžeć&quot; and its derivatives.
* are alveolar , is alveolo-palatal , whereas are dental .
** before (in the case of also before ) are weakly palatalized . also reports palatalized as allophones of . Among these, the labiodental are extremely rare.
** are velar in front of velar consonants.
** is very rare. In many cases, it merges with into .
** are very rare. According to , the phonemic status of is controversial.
* In most dialects, are palato-alveolar. This is unlike Lower Sorbian, where these consonants are laminal retroflex (flat postalveolar) (Lower Sorbian does not have a voiced counterpart). Laminal retroflex realizations of also occur in Upper Sorbian dialects spoken in some villages north of Hoyerswerda.
* are velar, whereas are uvular.
** An aspirated is a morpheme-initial allophone of in some cases, as well as a possible word-initial allophone of .
** is typically accompanied with trilling of the uvula , so that &#x27;fault&#x27; is typically pronounced .
** does not occur word-initially, whereas does not occur word-finally.
** are typically realized as fricatives or approximants . They can be trilled in clear and careful pronunciation. Furthermore, can also be realized as a voiceless fricative . It can also be vocalized in the syllable coda, as in &#x27;University&#x27;. They are never alveolar , which is an archaic pronunciation.
** Soft is strongly palatalized.
* An epenthetic is inserted before a post-vocalic soft consonant, yielding a diphthong. If the soft consonant occurs before or , it is often realized as hard, and the vowels merge to .
* In literary language, the contrast between hard and soft consonants is neutralized in word-final position. For instance, the letter represents the sequence in this position (as in &quot;dźeń&quot; &#x27;day&#x27;), not a single phoneme .

====Final devoicing and assimilation====

Upper Sorbian has both final devoicing and regressive voicing assimilation, both word-internal and across word boundaries. In the latter context, is voiced to . Regressive voicing assimilation does not occur before sonorants and .

===Stress===

* Words consisting of up to three syllables are stressed on the first syllable.
* Foreign words, such as &quot;student&quot; &#x27;student&#x27;, preserve their original accent.

<doc id="293074" wikidata="Q13286" url="?curid=293074" title="Lower Sorbian language">
<text>Lower Sorbian () is a West Slavic minority language spoken in eastern Germany in the historical province of Lower Lusatia, today part of Brandenburg.

Standard Lower Sorbian is one of the two literary Sorbian languages, the other being the more widely spoken Upper Sorbian. The Lower Sorbian literary standard was developed in the 18th century, based on a southern form of the Cottbus dialect. The standard variety of Lower Sorbian has received structural influence from Upper Sorbian.

Lower Sorbian is spoken in and around the city of Cottbus in Brandenburg. Signs in this region are typically bilingual, and Cottbus has a &quot;Lower Sorbian Gymnasium&quot; where one language of instruction is Lower Sorbian. It is a heavily endangered language. Most native speakers today belong to the older generations.

==Phonology==
The phonology of Lower Sorbian has been greatly influenced by contact with German, especially in Cottbus and larger towns. For example, German-influenced pronunciation tends to have a voiced uvular fricative instead of the alveolar trill . In villages and rural areas, German influence is less marked, and the pronunciation is more &quot;typically Slavic&quot;.

===Consonants===

* are bilabial, whereas are labiodental, are labiovelar, although the latter may be a labial–palatal approximant.
* Consonants in parentheses are allophones of another consonant before another consonant or vowel, for example may palatalize to before front vowels or , and may assimilate to before velar consonants.
* The Proto-Slavic contrasts between and their palatalized counterparts has been lost phonetically in Lower Sorbian, with the marginal phonemes occurring only before certain vowels. The contrasts between and their palatalized counterparts has evolved into a contrast between and . The contrast between and its palatalized counterpart has evolved into a contrast between while the contrasts between and their palatalized counterparts has remained intact and the contrasts between and their palatalized counterparts no longer exists.
* are alveolar , whereas are dental .
* have been variously transcribed with and . Their actual phonetic realization is flat postalveolar in all of the Lower Sorbian-speaking area. This is unlike in standard Upper Sorbian, where these are palato-alveolar .

====Final devoicing and assimilation====
Lower Sorbian has both final devoicing and regressive voicing assimilation: 
*&quot;dub&quot; &quot;oak&quot; is pronounced 
*&quot;susedka&quot; &quot;(female) neighbor&quot; is pronounced 
*&quot;licba&quot; &quot;number&quot; is pronounced 

The hard postalveolar fricative is assimilated to before :
*&quot;šćit&quot; &quot;protection&quot; is pronounced 

===Vowels===
The vowel inventory of Lower Sorbian is exactly the same as that of Upper Sorbian. It is also very similar to the vowel inventory of Slovene.

* is retracted to after hard consonants.
* are diphthongized to in slow speech.
* The and distinctions are weakened or lost in unstressed syllables.
* is phonetically central .

===Stress===
Stress in Lower Sorbian normally falls on the first syllable of the word:

* &quot;Lusatia&quot;
* &quot;friend&quot;
* &quot;Cottbus&quot;

In loanwords, stress may fall on any of the last three syllables:

* &quot;boarding school&quot;
* &quot;control&quot;
* &quot;September&quot;
* &quot;police&quot;
* &quot;organization&quot;

Most one-syllable prepositions attract the stress to themselves when they precede a noun or pronoun of one or two syllables:

* &quot;on the courtyard&quot;
* &quot;near me&quot;
* &quot;into the city&quot; (the of becomes when unstressed)

However, nouns of three or more syllables retain their stress:

* &quot;in front of the teacher&quot;
* &quot;on a journey&quot;

==Orthography==

The Sorbian alphabet is based on the Latin script but uses diacritics such as the acute accent and caron.

==Sample==
Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Lower Sorbian:

(All people are born free and equal in their dignity and rights. They are given reason and conscience and they shall create their relationships to one another according to the spirit of brotherhood.)

<doc id="293076" wikidata="Q12148490" url="?curid=293076" title="Placer mining">
<text>Placer mining () is the mining of stream bed deposits for minerals. This may be done by open-pit mining or by various surface excavating equipment or tunneling equipment.

Placer mining is frequently used for precious metal deposits (particularly gold) and gemstones, both of which are often found in alluvial deposits—deposits of sand and gravel in modern or ancient stream beds, or occasionally glacial deposits. The metal or gemstones, having been moved by stream flow from an original source such as a vein, are typically only a minuscule portion of the total deposit. Since gems and heavy metals like gold are considerably denser than sand, they tend to accumulate at the base of placer deposits.

Placer deposits can be as young as a few years old, such as the Canadian Queen Charlotte beach gold placer deposits, or billions of years old like the Elliot Lake uranium paleoplacer within the Huronian Supergroup in Canada.

The containing material in an alluvial placer mine may be too loose to safely mine by tunnelling, though it is possible where the ground is permanently frozen. Where water under pressure is available, it may be used to mine, move, and separate the precious material from the deposit, a method known as hydraulic mining, hydraulic sluicing or hydraulicking.

==Etymology==
The word placer derives from the Spanish &quot;placer&quot;, meaning shoal or alluvial/sand deposit, from &quot;plassa&quot; (place) from Medieval Latin &quot;placea&quot; (place) the origin word for &quot;place&quot; and &quot;plaza&quot; in English. The word in Spanish is thus derived from &quot;placea&quot; and refers directly to an alluvial or glacial deposit of sand or gravel.

An alternative etymology derives the English word from American Spanish &quot;placer&quot; (placer, sandbank), from earlier &quot;placel&quot;, apparently from obsolete Portuguese &quot;placel&quot; (placer, sandbank).

==History==

Placers supplied most of the gold for a large part of the ancient world. Hydraulic mining methods such as hushing were used widely by the Romans across their empire, but especially in the gold fields of northern Spain after its conquest by Augustus in 25 BC. One of the largest sites was at Las Médulas, where seven 30 mile long aqueducts were used to work the alluvial gold deposits through the first century AD. 

In North America, placer mining was famous in the context of several gold rushes, particularly the California Gold Rush and the Colorado Gold Rush, the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush and the Klondike Gold Rush.

Placer mining continues in many areas of the world as a source of diamonds, industrial minerals and metals, gems (in Myanmar and Sri Lanka), platinum, and of gold (in Yukon, Alaska and British Columbia).

==Deposits==

An area well protected from the flow of water is a great location to find gold. Gold is very dense and is often found in a stream bed. Many different gold deposits are dealt with in different ways. Placer deposits attract many prospectors because their costs are very low. There are many different places gold could be placed, such as a residual, alluvial, and a bench deposit.

===Residual===
Residual deposits are more common where there has been weathering on rocks and where there hasn&#x27;t been water. They are deposits which have not been washed away yet or been moved. The residual usually lies at the site of the lode. This type of deposit undergoes rock weathering.

===Alluvial===
Alluvial or eluvial deposits are the most common type of placer gold, and are often the richest. They contain pieces of gold that have been washed away from the lode by the force of water, and have been deposited in sediment in or near watercourses or former watercourses. Therefore, they are mostly found in valleys or flood plains.

===Bench===
Bench deposits are created when gold reaches a stream bed. Gold accumulations in an old stream bed that are high are called bench deposits. They can be found on higher slopes that drain into valleys. Dry stream beds (benches) can be situated far from other water sources and can sometimes be found on mountaintops. Today, many miners focus their activities on bench deposits.

=== Deep leads ===
Deep leads are created when a former stream bed is covered over by later sediments or by igneous rock from a volcanic eruption. Examples existed in the goldfields of Gulgong and Creswick in Australia. The gold bearing gravel is accessed by shafts and drives similar to underground mining techniques but is typically processed as if alluvial gold. The heat associated with an igneous lava flow, in some cases, altered the gold bearing gravel so that it needed to be crushed first to extract the gold; an example of this kind of deep lead was found at Forest Reefs, also in Australia. If vegetation was buried along with the old stream, by a volcanic eruption, the effect of heat and decay upon that buried vegetation can result in the presence of harmful amounts of carbonic acid gas (), as occurred in the deep lead deposit at Creswick.

==Methods==
A number of methods are used to mine placer gold and gems, both in terms of extracting the minerals from the ground, and separating it from the non-gold or non-gems.

===Panning===

The simplest technique to extract gold from placer ore is panning. This technique has been dated back to at least the Roman Empire. In panning, some mined ore is placed in a large metal or plastic pan, combined with a generous amount of water, and agitated so that the gold particles, being of higher density than the other material, settle to the bottom of the pan. The lighter gangue material such as sand, mud and gravel are then washed over the side of the pan, leaving the gold behind. Once a placer deposit is located by gold panning, the miner usually shifts to equipment that can treat volumes of sand and gravel more quickly and efficiently. Gold panning was commonly used on its own during the California gold rush; however, it is rarely profitable anymore since even an expert gold prospector can only process approximately one cubic yard of material for every 10 hours of work.

===Rocker===

A rocker box (or &quot;cradle&quot;) is capable of greater volume than a gold pan; however, its production is still limited when compared to other methods of placer mining. It is only capable of processing about 3 or 4 yards of gravel a day. It is more portable and requires less infrastructure than a sluice box, being fed not by a sluice but by hand. The box sits on rockers, which when rocked separates out the gold, and the practice was referred to as &quot;rocking the golden baby&quot;. A typical rocker box is approximately 42 inches long, 16 inches wide and 12 inches deep with a removable tray towards the top, where gold is captured. The rocker was commonly used throughout North America during the early gold rush, but its popularity diminished as other methods that could handle a larger volume became more common. 

===Sluice box===


The same principle may be employed on a larger scale by constructing a short sluice box, with barriers along the bottom called riffles to trap the heavier gold particles as water washes them and the other material along the box. This method better suits excavation with shovels or similar implements to feed ore into the device. Sluice boxes can be as short as a few feet, or more than ten feet (a common term for one that is over six feet +/- is a &quot;Long Tom&quot;). While they are capable of handling a larger volume of material than simpler methods such as the rocker box or gold panning, this can come at the cost of efficiency, since conventional sluice boxes have been found to recover only about 40% of the gold that they process.

The sluice box was used extensively during the California gold rush for larger scale operations. When streams became increasingly depleted, the grizzly and undercurrent variants of the sluice box were developed. The grizzly is a set of parallel bars placed at a 45-degree angle over the main sluice box, which filter out larger material. The undercurrent variety includes additional, auxiliary sluice boxes where material is initially filtered. It then travels through a trough into the primary sluice box where it is filtered again. Both the grizzly and undercurrent are designed to increase efficiency, and were often used in combination.

===Dry washing===

Sluicing is only effective in areas where there is a sufficient water supply, and is impractical in arid areas. Alternative methods developed that used the blowing of air to separate out gold from sand. One of the more common methods of dry washing is the Mexican dry wash. This method involves placing gravel on a riffle board with a bellows placed underneath it. The bellows is then used to blow air through the board in order to remove the lighter material from the heavier gold. The amount of gravel that can be processed using the Mexican dry wash technique varies from 1 1/2 to 4 cubic yards per day, and can be processed at a maximum efficiency of 80%. Another form of dry washing is &quot;winnowing&quot;. This method was most commonly used by Spanish miners in America, and only requires a blanket and a box with a screen on the bottom. The material is first filtered through the box so only the finer material is placed onto the blanket. The material on the blanket is then flung into the air so that any breeze can blow away the lighter material and leave the gold behind. While this method is extremely simple and requires very few materials, it is also slow and inefficient.

===Trommel===

A trommel is composed of a slightly inclined rotating metal tube (the &#x27;scrubber section&#x27;) with a screen at its discharge end. Lifter bars, sometimes in the form of bolted in angle iron, are attached to the interior of the scrubber section. The ore is fed into the elevated end of the trommel. Water, often under pressure, is provided to the scrubber and screen sections and the combination of water and mechanical action frees the valuable heavy minerals from the lighter gravel. The mineral bearing ore that passes through the screen is then further concentrated in smaller devices such as sluices and jigs. The larger pieces of ore that do not pass through the screen can be carried to a waste stack by a conveyor.

===Gold dredge===
Large-scale sifting of placer gold from large volumes of alluvial deposits can be done by use of mechanical dredges. These dredges were originally very large boats capable of processing massive amounts of material; however, as the gold has become increasingly depleted in the most easily accessible areas, smaller and more maneuverable dredges have become much more common. These smaller dredges commonly operate by sucking water and gravel up through long hoses using a pump, where the gold can then be separated using more traditional methods such as a sluice box.
===Underground mining===
In areas where the ground is permanently frozen, such as in Siberia, Alaska, and the Yukon, placer deposits may be mined underground. As the frozen ground is otherwise too hard and firm to mine by hand, historically fires were built so as to thaw the ground before digging it. Later methods involve blasting jets of steam (&quot;points&quot;) into the frozen deposits.

Deep leads are accessed by techniques similar to conventional underground mining.

==Environmental effects==
Although this procedure is not required, the process water may be continuously recycled and the ore from which the sought-after minerals have been extracted (&quot;the tailings&quot;) can be reclaimed. While these recycling and reclamation processes are more common in modern placer mining operations they are still not universally done.
In earlier times the process water was not generally recycled and the spent ore was not reclaimed. The remains of a Roman alluvial gold mine at Las Médulas, Spain are so spectacular as to justify the site being designated UNESCO World Heritage status. The methods used by the Roman miners are described by Pliny the Elder in his work Naturalis Historia published in about 77 AD. The author was a Procurator in the region and so probably witnessed large-scale hydraulic mining of the placer deposits there. He also added that the local lake Carucedo had been heavily silted by the mining methods.

Environmental activists describe the hydraulic mining form of placer mining as environmentally destructive because of the large amounts of silt that it adds to previously clear running streams (also known as the &quot;Dahlonega Method&quot;). Most modern placer mines use settling ponds, if only to ensure that they have sufficient water to run their sluicing operations.

In California, from 1853 to 1884, &quot;hydraulicking&quot; of placers removed an enormous amount of material from the gold fields, material that was carried downstream and raised the level of portions of the Central Valley by some seven feet in affected areas and settled in long bars up to 20 feet thick in parts of San Francisco Bay. The process raised an opposition calling themselves the &quot;Anti-Debris Association&quot;. In January 1884, the North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company case banned the flushing of debris into streams, and the hydraulic mining mania in California&#x27;s gold country came to an end.

==Continuing Support==

Despite environmental concerns, placer mining is still important in areas such as the Yukon, and it has considerable support, with local businesses often displaying signs to that effect.
==Examples==
* The Witwatersrand Basin in South Africa is an example of a placer deposit, as it is a three billion-year-old, alluvial sedimentary basin containing at least 70 ore minerals.
* The Fraser Canyon Gold Rush prompted in 1858 the incorporation of Colony of British Columbia (1858–1866).
* The Klondike Gold Rush began in 1896 when nuggets of gold were found in the Klondike region of Alaska and the Canadian Yukon Territory. The nuggets were found in running water, making the Klondike Gold deposit an alluvial placer mining deposit, which it soon became when 30,000 gold-seekers trekked to the region.
* The area around Valdez Creek as almost exclusively been placer mined since 1897.

<text>A video game remake is a video game closely adapted from an earlier title, usually for the purpose of modernizing a game with updated graphics for newer hardware and gameplay for contemporary audiences. Typically, a remake of such game software shares essentially the same title, fundamental gameplay concepts, and core story elements of the original game, although some aspects of the original game may have been changed for the remake.

Remakes are often made by the original developer or copyright holder, and sometimes by the fan community. If created by the community, video game remakes are sometimes also called fangames and can be seen as part of the retro gaming phenomenon.

==Definition==
A remake offers a newer interpretation of an older work, characterized by updated or changed assets. For example, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask 3D&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS are considered remakes of their original versions for the Nintendo 64, and not a remaster or a port, since there are new character models and texture packs. &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD&quot; for Wii U would be considered a remaster, since it retains the same, albeit updated upscaled aesthetics of the original.

A remake typically maintains the same story, genre, and fundamental gameplay ideas of the original work. The intent of a remake is usually to take an older game that has become outdated and update it for a new platform and audience. A remake will not necessarily preserve the original gameplay especially if it is dated, instead remaking the gameplay to conform to the conventions of contemporary games or later titles in the same series in order to make a game marketable to a new audience.

For example, for Sierra&#x27;s 1991 remake of &quot;Space Quest&quot;, the developers used the engine, point-and-click interface, and graphical style of &quot;Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and The Time Rippers&quot;, replacing the original graphics and text parser interface of the original. However, other elements, like the narrative, puzzles and sets, were largely preserved. Another example is &quot;Black Mesa&quot;, a remake built entirely from the ground up in the Source Engine that remakes in-game textures, assets, models, and facial animations, while taking place in the events of the original &quot;Half-Life&quot; game. &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; (2019) is a remake of the 1998 game &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;; while the original uses tank controls and fixed camera angles, the remake features &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; third-person shooter gameplay similar to &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; and more recent games in the series that allows players the option to move while using their weapons similar to &quot;Resident Evil 6&quot;.

==History==
In the early history of video games, remakes were generally regarded as &quot;conversions&quot; and seldom associated with nostalgia. Due to limited and often highly divergent hardware, games appearing on multiple platforms usually had to be entirely remade. These conversions often included considerable changes to the graphics and gameplay, and could be regarded retroactively as remakes, but are distinguished from later remakes largely by intent. A conversion is created with the primary goal of tailoring a game to a specific piece of hardware, usually contemporaneous or nearly contemporaneous with the original release. An early example was &quot;Gun Fight&quot;, Midway&#x27;s 1975 reprogrammed version of Taito&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Western Gun&quot;, with the main difference being the use of a microprocessor in the reprogrammed version, which allowed improved graphics and smoother animation than the discrete logic of the original. In 1980, Warren Robinett created &quot;Adventure&quot; for the Atari 2600, a graphical version of the 1970s text adventure &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;. Also in 1980, Atari released the first officially licensed home console game conversion of an arcade title, Taito&#x27;s 1978 hit &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, for the Atari 2600. The game became the first &quot;killer app&quot; for a video game console by quadrupling the system&#x27;s sales. Since then, it became a common trend to port arcade games to home systems since the second console generation, though at the time they were often more limited than the original arcade games due to the technical limitations of home consoles.

In 1985, Sega released a pair of arcade remakes of older home video games. &quot;Pitfall II: Lost Caverns (arcade game)&quot; was effectively a remake of both the original &quot;Pitfall!&quot; and its sequel &quot;Pitfall II: Lost Caverns&quot; with new level layouts and colorful, detailed graphics. That same year, Sega adapted the 1982 computer game &quot;Choplifter&quot; for the arcades, taking the fundamental gameplay of the original and greatly expanding it, adding new environments, enemies, and gameplay elements. This version was very successful, and later adapted to the Master System and Famicom. Both of these games were distinguished from most earlier conversions in that they took major liberties with the source material, attempting to modernize both the gameplay as well as the graphics.

Some of the earliest remakes to be recognized as such were attempts to modernize games to the standards of later games in the series. Some were even on the same platforms as the original, for example &quot;Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness&quot;, a 1986 remake of the original that appeared on multiple platforms, including the Apple II, the system the game originated on. Other early remakes of this type include Sierra&#x27;s early-1990s releases of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;, &quot;Space Quest&quot; and &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot;. These games used the technology and interface of the most recent games in Sierra&#x27;s series, and original assets in a dramatically different style. The intent was not simply to bring the game to a new platform, but to modernize older games which had in various ways become dated.

With the birth of the retrogaming phenomenon, remakes became a way for companies to revive nostalgic brands. &quot;Galaga &#x27;88&quot; and &quot;Super Space Invaders &#x27;91&quot; were both attempts to revitalize aging arcade franchises with modernized graphics and new gameplay elements, while preserving many signature aspects of the original games. The 16-bit generation of console games was marked by greatly enhanced graphics compared to the previous generation, but often relatively similar gameplay, which led to an increased interest in remakes of games from the previous generation. &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot; remade the entire NES &quot;Mario&quot; series, and was met with great commercial success. Remake compilations of the &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; and &quot;Mega Man&quot; series followed. As RPGs increased in popularity, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, &quot;Ys&quot; and &quot;Kyūyaku Megami Tensei&quot; were also remade. In the mid-&#x27;90s, Atari released a series of remakes with the &quot;2000&quot; brand, including &quot;Tempest 2000&quot;, &quot;Battlezone 2000&quot;, and &quot;Defender 2000&quot;. After Atari&#x27;s demise, Hasbro continued the tradition, with 3D remakes of &quot;Pong&quot;, &quot;Centipede&quot;, and &quot;Asteroids&quot;.

By 1994 the popularity of CD-ROM led to many remakes with digitized voices and, sometimes, better graphics, although &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; noted the &quot;amateur acting&quot; in many new and remade games on CD. Emulation also made perfect ports of older games possible, with compilations becoming a popular way for publishers to capitalize on older properties.

Budget pricing gave publishers the opportunity to match their game&#x27;s price with the perceived lower value proposition of an older game, opening the door for newer remakes. In 2003, Sega launched the Sega Ages line for PlayStation 2, initially conceived as a series of modernized remakes of classic games, though the series later diversified to include emulated compilations. The series concluded with a release that combined the two approaches, and included a remake of &quot;Fantasy Zone II&quot; that ran, via emulation, on hardware dating to the time of the original release, one of the few attempts at an enhanced remake to make no attempts at modernization. The advent of downloadable game services like Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network has further fueled the expanded market for remakes, as the platform allows companies to sell their games at a lower price, seen as more appropriate for the smaller size typical of retro games. Some XBLA and PSN remakes include &quot;Bionic Commando Rearmed&quot;, &quot;Jetpac Refuelled&quot;, &quot;Wipeout HD&quot; (a remake not of the original &quot;Wipeout&quot; but of the two PSP games), &quot;Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Oratorio Tangram&quot; and &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix&quot;.

Some remakes may include the original game as a bonus feature. The 2009 remake of &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; took this a step further by allowing players to switch between the original and remade versions on the fly with a single button press. This trend was continued in the sequel, and is also a feature in &quot;&quot; and later in &quot;Halo 2 Anniversary&quot; as part of &quot;&quot;.

Remasters and remakes on the Nintendo DS include &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot;, &quot;Kirby Super Star Ultra&quot;, &quot;Diddy Kong Racing DS&quot;, &quot;Pokémon HeartGold&quot; and &quot;SoulSilver&quot;, &quot;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; and &quot;IV&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; through &quot;VI&quot;, and &quot;Kingdom Hearts Re:coded&quot;.

== Variations ==
=== Fan remake ===

Games unsupported by the rights-holders often spark remakes created by hobbyists and game communities. An example is &quot;OpenRA&quot;, which is a modernized remake of the classic &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; real-time-strategy games. Beyond cross-platform support, it adds comfort functions and gameplay functionality inspired by successors of the original games. Another notable examples are &quot;Pioneers&quot;, a remake and sequel in spirit to &quot;&quot;; &quot;CSBWin&quot;, a remake of the dungeon crawler classic &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;; and &quot;Privateer Gemini Gold&quot;, a remake of &quot;Wing Commander: Privateer&quot;.

&quot;Skywind&quot; is a fan remake of &quot;Morrowind&quot; (2002) running on Bethesda&#x27;s Creation Engine, utilising the source code, assets and gameplay mechanics of &quot;Skyrim&quot; (2011). The original game developers, Bethesda Softworks, have given project volunteers their approval. The remake team includes over 70 volunteers in artist, composer, designer, developer, and voice-actor roles. In November 2014, the team reported to have finished half of the remake&#x27;s environment, over 10,000 new dialogue lines, and three hours of series-inspired soundtrack. The same open-development project is also working on &quot;Skyblivion&quot;, a remake of &quot;Oblivion&quot; (the game between &quot;Morrowind&quot; and &quot;Skyrim&quot;) in the &quot;Skyrim&quot; engine, and &quot;Morroblivion&quot;, a remake of &quot;Morrowind&quot; in the &quot;Oblivion&quot; engine (which still has a significant userbase on older PCs).

=== Demake ===
The term &quot;demake&quot; may refer to games created deliberately with an artstyle inspired by older games of a previous video game generation. The action platformer &quot;Mega Man 9&quot; is an example of such a game. Although remakes typically aim to adapt a game from a more limited platform to a more advanced one, a rising interest in older platforms has inspired some to do the opposite, remaking or adapting modern games to the technical standards of older platforms, usually going so far as to implement them on obsolete hardware platforms, hence the term &quot;Demake&quot;. Such games are either physical or emulated.

Modern demakes often change the 3D gameplay to a 2D one. Popular demakes include &quot;&quot;, an official Game Boy Color port of &quot;Quest 64&quot;; &quot;Super Smash Land&quot;, an unofficial Game Boy-style demake of &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;; &quot;D-Pad Hero&quot;, a NES-esque demake of &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;; &quot;Rockman 7 FC&quot; and &quot;Rockman 8 FC&quot;, NES-styled demakes of &quot;Mega Man 7&quot; and &quot;Mega Man 8&quot;, respectively; &quot;Gang Garrison 2&quot;, a pixelated demake of &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;; Bloodborne PSX, a PS1 demake of Bloodborne; and &quot;Halo 2600&quot;, an Atari 2600 demake of Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Halo&quot; series. There are also NES-style demakes of the &quot;Touhou Project&quot; games &quot;Embodiment of Scarlet Devil&quot; and &quot;Perfect Cherry Blossom&quot;. Some demakes are created to showcase and push the abilities of older generation systems such as the Atari 2600. An example of this is the 2013 game &quot;Princess Rescue&quot;, which is a demake of the NES title &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;

While most demakes are homebrew efforts from passionate fans, some are officially endorsed by the original creators such as &quot;Pac-Man Championship Edition&quot;&#x27;s Famicom/NES demake being printed onto Japanese physical editions of the &quot;Namcot Collection&quot; as an original bonus game.

For much of the 1990s in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, black market developers created unauthorized adaptations of then-modern games such as &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, &quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; or &quot;Tekken&quot; for the NES, which enjoyed considerable popularity in the regions because of the availability of low-cost compatible systems.

== Related terms ==
=== Port ===

A port is a conversion of a game to a new platform that relies heavily on existing work and assets. A port may include various enhancements like improved performance, resolution, and sometimes even additional content, but differs from a remake in that it still relies heavily on the original assets and engine of the source game. Sometimes, ports even remove content that was present in the original version. For example, the handheld console ports of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; had fewer characters than the original arcade game and other console ports due to system storage limitations but otherwise were still faithful to the original in terms of gameplay.

Compared to the intentional video game remake or remaster which is often done years or decades after the original came out, ports or conversions are typically released during the same generation as the original (the exception being mobile gaming versions of PC games, such as &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, since mobile gaming platforms did not exist until the 2010s going forward). Home console ports usually came out less than a year after the original arcade game, such as the distribution of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; for home consoles by Acclaim Entertainment. Since the 2000s as arcade releases are no longer the original launch platform for a video game, publishers tend to release the video game simultaneously on several consoles first and then port to the PC later.

=== Remaster ===

A conversion that contains a great deal of remade assets may sometimes be considered a &quot;remaster&quot; or a &quot;partial remake&quot;, although video game publishers are not always clear on the distinction. &quot;&quot; for example uses the term &quot;Remastered&quot; to distinguish itself from the original NES game it was based on, even though it is a clean-slate remake with a different engine and assets. Compared to a port which is typically released in the same era as the original, a remaster is done years or decades after the original in order to take advantage of generation technological improvements (the latter which a port avoids doing). Unlike a remake which often changes the now-dated gameplay, a remaster is very faithful to the original in that aspect (in order to appeal to that nostalgic audience) while permitting only a limited number of gameplay tweaks for the sake of convenience.

=== Reboot ===

Games that use an existing brand but are conceptually very different from the original, such as &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; (1992) and &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; (2001) or &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; (1996) and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; (2013) are usually regarded as reboots rather than remakes.

<text>An actuator is a component of a machine that produces force, torque, or displacement, when an electrical, pneumatic or hydraulic input is supplied to it in a system (called an actuating system). The effect is usually produced in a controlled way. An actuator translates such an input signal into the required form of mechanical energy. It is a type of transducer. In simple terms, it is a &quot;mover&quot;.

An actuator requires a control device (which provides control signal) and a source of energy. The control signal is relatively low in energy and may be voltage, electric current, pneumatic, or hydraulic fluid pressure, or even human power. In the electric, hydraulic, and pneumatic sense, it is a form of automation or automatic control.

The displacement achieved is commonly linear or rotational, as exemplified by linear motors and rotary motors, respectively. Rotary motion is more natural for small machines making large displacements. By means of a leadscrew, rotary motion can be adapted to function as a linear actuator (which produces a linear motion, but is not a linear motor). 

Another broad classification of actuators separates them into two types: incremental-drive actuators and continuous-drive actuators. Stepper motors are one type of incremental-drive actuators. Examples of continuous-drive actuators include DC torque motors, induction motors, hydraulic and pneumatic motors, and piston-cylinder drives (rams). 

==Types of actuators==

===Mechanical===
An actuator can be just a mechanism that is directly driven by the motions or forces of other parts of the system. An example is the camshafts that drive the intake and exhaust valves in internal combustion engines, driven by the engine itself. Another example is the mechanism that strikes the hours in a traditional grandfather clock or cuckoo clock.

===Hydraulic===
A hydraulic actuator typically uses the pressure of a liquid (usually oil) to cause a piston to slide inside a hollow cylindrical tube linear, rotatory or oscillatory motion. In a &quot;single acting&quot; actuator the fluid pressure is applied to just one side of the piston, so that it applies useful force in only one direction. The opposite motion may be affected by a spring, by gravity, or by other forces present in the system. In a &quot;double acting&quot; actuator, the return stroke is driven by fluid pressure applied to the opposite side of the piston.

Since liquids are nearly impossible to compress, a hydraulic actuator can exert a large force. The drawback of this approach is its limited acceleration. They respond quickly to input changes, have little inertia, can operate continuously over a relatively large working range, and can hold their position without any significant energy input.

A hydraulic actuator can be used to displace the rack of a rack and pinion mechanism, causing the pinion to turn. This arrangement is used, for example, to operate valves in pipelines and other industrial fluid transport installations.

===Pneumatic===

A pneumatic actuator is similar to a hydraulic one but uses a gas (usually air) instead of a liquid. Compared to hydraulic actuators, pneumatic ones are less complicated because they do not need pipes for the return and recycling of the working fluid. On the other hand, they still need external infrastructure such as compressors, reservoirs, filters, and air treatment subsystems, which often makes them less convenient that electrical and electromechanical actuators.

In the first steam engines and in all steam locomotives, steam pressure is used to drive pneumatic actuators to produce a reciprocating motion, which is converted to rotary motion by some sort of crankshaft mechanism.

===Electric===
Since 1960, several actuator technologies have been developed. Electric actuators can be classified in the following groups:

====Electromechanical====
An electromechanical actuator (EMA) uses mechanical means to convert the rotational force of an ordinary (rotary) electric motor into a linear movement. The mechanism may be a toothed belt or a screw (either a ball or a lead screw or planetary roller screw).

The main advantages of electromechanical actuators are their relatively good level of accuracy with respect to pneumatics, their possible long lifecycle and the little maintenance effort required (might require grease). It is possible to reach relatively high force, on the order of 100 kN.

The main limitation of these actuators are the reachable speed, the important dimensions and weight they require.
The main application of such actuators is mainly seen in health care devices and factory automation.

====Electrohydraulic====
Another approach is an electrohydraulic actuator, where the electric motor remains the prime mover but provides torque to operate a hydraulic accumulator that is then used to transmit actuation force in much the same way that diesel engine/hydraulics are typically used in heavy equipment.

Electrical energy is used to actuate equipment such as multi-turn valves, or electric-powered construction and excavation equipment.

When used to control the flow of fluid through a valve, a brake is typically installed above the motor to prevent the fluid pressure from forcing open the valve. If no brake is installed, the actuator gets activated to reclose the valve, which is slowly forced open again. This sets up an oscillation (open, close, open ...) and the motor and actuator will eventually become damaged.

====Rotary====
Electric rotary actuators use a rotary motor to turn the target part over a certain angle. Rotary actuators can have up to a rotation of 360 degrees. This allows it to differ from a linear motor as the linear is bound to a set distance compared to the rotary motor. Rotary motors have the ability to be set at any given degree in a field making the device easier to set up still with durability and a set torque.

Rotary motors can be powered by 3 different techniques such as Electric, Fluid, or Manual. However, Fluid powered rotary actuators have 5 sub-sections of actuators such as Scotch Yoke, Vane, Rack-and-Pinion, Helical, and Electrohydraulic. All forms have their own specific design and use allowing the ability to choose multiple angles of degree.

Applications for the rotary actuators are just about endless but, will more than likely be found dealing with mostly hydraulic pressured devices and industries. Rotary actuators are even used in the robotics field when seeing robotic arms in industry lines. Anything you see that deals with motion control systems to perform a task in technology is a good chance to be a rotary actuator.

====Linear====
A linear electric actuator uses a linear motor, which can be thought as a rotary electric motor which has been cut and unrolled. Thus, instead of producing a rotational movement, it produces a linear force along their length. Because it generally has lower friction losses than the alternatives, a linear electric actuator can last over a hundred million cycles.

Linear motors are divided in 3 basic categories: flat linear motor (classic), U-Channel linear motors and Tubular linear motors.

Linear motor technology is the best solution in the context of a low load (up to 30Kgs) because it provides the highest level of speed, control and accuracy.

In fact, it represents the most desired and versatile technology. Due to the limitations of pneumatics, the current electric actuator technology is a viable solution for specific industry applications and it has been successfully introduced in market segments such as the watchmaking, semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries (as high as 60% of the applications. The growing interest for this technology, can be explained by the following characteristics:

* High precision (equal or less than 0,1 mm);
* High cycling rate (greater than 100 cycles/min);
* Possible usage in clean and highly-regulated environments (no leakages of air, humidity or lubricants allowed);
* Need for programmable motion in the situation of complex operations

The main disadvantages of linear motors are:

* They are expensive respect to pneumatics and other electric technologies. 
* They are not easy to integrate in standard machineries due to their important size and high weight.
* They have a low force density respect to pneumatic and electromechanical actuators.

===Thermal===
An actuator may be driven by heat through the expansion that most solid material exhibit when the temperature increases. This principle is commonly used, for example, to operate electric switches in thermostats. Typically, a (non-electronic) thermostat contains a strip with two layers of different metals, that will bend when heated. 

Thermal actuators may also exploit the properties of shape-memory alloys. 

===Magnetic===
Some actuators are driven by externally applied magnetic fields. They typically contain parts made of ferromagnetic materials that are strongly attracted to each other when they are magnetized by the external field. An example are the reed switches that may be used as door opening sensors in a building security system. 

Alternatively, magnetic actuators can use magnetic shape-memory alloys.

===Soft actuators===
A soft actuator is made of a flexible material that changes its shape in response to stimuli including mechanical, thermal, magnetic, and electrical. Soft actuators mainly deal with the robotics of humans rather than industry which is what most of the actuators are used for. For most actuators they are mechanically durable yet do not have an ability to adapt compared to soft actuators. The soft actuators apply to mainly safety and healthcare for humans which is why they are able to adapt to environments by disassembling their parts. This is why the driven energy behind soft actuators deal with flexible materials like certain polymers and liquids that are harmless

The majority of the existing soft actuators are fabricated using multistep low yield processes such as micro-moulding, solid freeform fabrication, and mask lithography. However, these methods require manual fabrication of devices, post processing/assembly, and lengthy iterations until maturity in the fabrication is achieved. To avoid the tedious and time-consuming aspects of the current fabrication processes, researchers are exploring an appropriate manufacturing approach for effective fabrication of soft actuators. Therefore, special soft systems that can be fabricated in a single step by rapid prototyping methods, such as 3D printing, are utilized to narrow the gap between the design and implementation of soft actuators, making the process faster, less expensive, and simpler. They also enable incorporation of all actuator components into a single structure eliminating the need to use external joints, adhesives, and fasteners.

Shape memory polymer (SMP) actuators are the most similar to our muscles, providing a response to a range of stimuli such as light, electrical, magnetic, heat, pH, and moisture changes. They have some deficiencies including fatigue and high response time that have been improved through the introduction of smart materials and combination of different materials by means of advanced fabrication technology. The advent of 3D printers has made a new pathway for fabricating low-cost and fast response SMP actuators. The process of receiving external stimuli like heat, moisture, electrical input, light or magnetic field by SMP is referred to as shape memory effect (SME). SMP exhibits some rewarding features such a low density, high strain recovery, biocompatibility, and biodegradability.

Photopolymers or light activated polymers (LAP) are another type of SMP that are activated by light stimuli. The LAP actuators can be controlled remotely with instant response and, without any physical contact, only with the variation of light frequency or intensity.

A need for soft, lightweight and biocompatible soft actuators in soft robotics has influenced researchers for devising pneumatic soft actuators because of their intrinsic compliance nature and ability to produce muscle tension.

Polymers such as dielectric elastomers (DE), ionic polymer–metal composites (IPMC), ionic electroactive polymers, polyelectrolyte gels, and gel-metal composites are common materials to form 3D layered structures that can be tailored to work as soft actuators. EAP actuators are categorized as 3D printed soft actuators that respond to electrical excitation as deformation in their shape.

==Examples and applications==
In engineering, actuators are frequently used as mechanisms to introduce motion, or to clamp an object so as to prevent motion. In electronic engineering, actuators are a subdivision of transducers. They are devices which transform an input signal (mainly an electrical signal) into some form of motion.

===Examples of actuators===
* Comb drive
* Digital micromirror device 
* Electric motor
* Electroactive polymer
* Hydraulic cylinder
* Piezoelectric actuator
* Plasma actuator
* Pneumatic actuator
* Screw jack
* Servomechanism
* Solenoid
* Stepper motor
* Shape-memory alloy
* Thermal bimorph
* Hydraulic actuators
* Trim actuator, in aircraft design

===Circular to linear conversion===
Motors are mostly used when circular motions are needed, but can also be used for linear applications by transforming circular to linear motion with a lead screw or similar mechanism. On the other hand, some actuators are intrinsically linear, such as piezoelectric actuators. Conversion between circular and linear motion is commonly made via a few simple types of mechanism including:
* Screw: Screw jack, ball screw and roller screw actuators all operate on the principle of the simple machine known as the screw. By rotating the actuator&#x27;s nut, the screw shaft moves in a line. By moving the screw shaft, the nut rotates.
* Wheel and axle: Hoist, winch, rack and pinion, chain drive, belt drive, rigid chain and rigid belt actuators operate on the principle of the wheel and axle. By rotating a wheel/axle (e.g. drum, gear, pulley or shaft) a linear member (e.g. cable, rack, chain or belt) moves. By moving the linear member, the wheel/axle rotates.

===Virtual instrumentation===
In virtual instrumentation, actuators and sensors are the hardware complements of virtual instruments.

==Performance metrics==
Performance metrics for actuators include speed, acceleration, and force (alternatively, angular speed, angular acceleration, and torque), as well as energy efficiency and considerations such as mass, volume, operating conditions, and durability, among others.

===Force===
When considering force in actuators for applications, two main metrics should be considered. These two are static and dynamic loads. Static load is the force capability of the actuator while not in motion. Conversely, the dynamic load of the actuator is the force capability while in motion.

===Speed===
Speed should be considered primarily at a no-load pace, since the speed will invariably decrease as the load amount increases. The rate the speed will decrease will directly correlate with the amount of force and the initial speed.

===Operating conditions===
Actuators are commonly rated using the standard IP Code rating system. Those that are rated for dangerous environments will have a higher IP rating than those for personal or common industrial use.

===Durability===
This will be determined by each individual manufacturer, depending on usage and quality.

<doc id="293080" wikidata="Q260537" url="?curid=293080" title="Lilya Brik">
<text>Lilya Yuryevna Brik (alternatively spelled &quot;Lili&quot; or &quot;Lily&quot;; ; née Kagan; – August 4, 1978) was a Russian author and socialite, connected to many leading figures in the Russian avant-garde between 1914 and 1930. She was the lover and muse of Vladimir Mayakovsky, even while she was married to poet, editor and literary critic Osip Brik (1888–1945). Pablo Neruda called Lilya the &quot;muse of Russian avant-garde&quot;. Her name was frequently abbreviated by her contemporaries as &quot;Л.Ю.&quot; or &quot;Л.Ю.Б.&quot; which are the first letters of the Russian word &quot;любовь&quot; &quot;lyubov&quot;, &quot;love&quot;.

==Early life==

She was born Lilya Yuryevna Kagan () into a wealthy Jewish family of Yuri Alexandrovich Kagan, a lawyer and Yelena Youlevna Berman, a music teacher in Moscow. Both she and her sister Ella &quot;Elsa&quot; received excellent education and were able to speak fluent German and French, and to play the piano. Lilya graduated from Moscow Institute of Architecture. 

As teenagers, the sisters were famous for their beauty. Their portraits were done by Alexander Rodchenko, Alexander Tyshler, David Shterenberg, David Burlyuk, Fernand Léger and later by Henri Matisse and Marc Chagall. When she was twenty years old, Lilya married poet-futurist and poetry critic Osip Brik whom she had met when she was 14 and he was 17; they were married March 26, 1912. (Her sister Elsa married Louis Aragon, a French writer). 

The daughter of a prosperous Jewish jurist, the handsome, erotically obsessed, highly cultivated Lili grew up with an overwhelming ambition prevalent among women of the Russian intelligentsia: to be perpetuated in human memory by being the muse of a famous poet. ... The two made a pact to love each other &quot;in the Chernyshevsky manner&quot; – a reference to one of nineteenth-century Russia&#x27;s most famous radical thinkers, who was an early advocate of &quot;open marriages.&quot; Living at the heart of an artistic bohemia and receiving the intelligentsia in the salon of his delectable wife, Osip Brik, true to his promise, calmly accepted his wife&#x27;s infidelities from the start. In fact, upon hearing his wife confess that she had gone to bed with the famous young poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, Brik exclaimed &quot;How could you refuse anything to that man?&quot; ... In 1918, when Mayakovsky and the Briks became inseparable, he simply moved in with them. Throughout the rest of his life, he made his home at a succession of flats that the Briks occupied.

Mayakovsky&#x27;s sexual relationship with Lili lasted from 1917 to 1923, and afterwards he continued to have a close friendship with the couple: &quot;For the rest of his life, Osip Brik, Lilya&#x27;s husband, remained the poet&#x27;s most trusted adviser, his most fervent proselytizer, and also a co-founder with him of the most dynamic avant-garde journal of the early Soviet era, &quot;Left Front of Art&quot;.&quot;

==With Mayakovsky==


In 1915, Lilya&#x27;s sister Elsa befriended aspiring futurist poet and graphic artist Vladimir Mayakovsky and invited him home, but he fell in love with Lilya. Despite the calamities of World War I, Russian Civil War and throughout the 1920s, their love affair caught and stayed in public attention, possibly because she did not divorce her husband.

After June 1915, Mayakovsky&#x27;s lyrical poetry was almost exclusively devoted to Lilya (with notable exception of late 1920s to Tatyana Yakovleva). He frequently explicitly dedicated his poems or referred in them to Lilya by name, for example in his &quot;Облако в штанах&quot; (&quot;A Cloud in Trousers&quot;, 1915), &quot;Флейта-позвоночник&quot; (&quot;The Backbone Flute&quot;, 1916), &quot;Про это&quot; (&quot;About This&quot;, 1922), &quot;Лилечка! Вместо письма&quot; (&quot;Lilechka! Instead of a Letter&quot;).

In 1918, Mayakovsky wrote the scenario for the movie &quot;Закованная фильмой&quot; (&quot;Chained by the Film&quot;), in which he and Lilya starred. The movie &quot;Neptune&quot; – produced by a private movie company – has been lost, with the exception of a few trial shots. Gianni Toti used them in his 1980s movie.

In 1926, after visiting Jewish kolkhozes in Crimea, she produced a documentary, &quot;Еврей и земля&quot; (&quot;The Jew and the Land&quot;), about Jewish communal farming in the USSR, with the script co-written by Mayakovsky and Victor Shklovsky. In 1928–1929, Lilya turned to directing a half-fiction-half-documentary motion picture &quot;Стеклянный глаз&quot; (&quot;The Glass Eye&quot;), a parody on &quot;bourgeois cinematography&quot;.

Some authors consider that his passion for Lilya was one of the motives that drove Mayakovsky to suicide in 1930 at his Moscow apartment immediately after his breakup with Veronika Polonskaya. Lilya, who at the time was in Berlin, denied this and wrote that earlier she saved him twice from committing suicide.

==After Mayakovsky&#x27;s death==
Later in 1930, after divorcing Osip earlier that year, she married Soviet General Vitaly Primakov. Primakov was arrested in 1936 and executed in 1937 in relation to the Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization, a part of the Moscow Trials. The charges were dropped and he was rehabilitated posthumously in 1957.

In her 1935 letter to Joseph Stalin, Lilya Brik complained that Mayakovsky&#x27;s poetic heritage was getting neglected. Stalin made a famous remark to Nikolai Yezhov: 

&quot;Comrade Yezhov, please take charge of Brik&#x27;s letter. Mayakovsky is still the best and the most talented poet of our Soviet epoch. Indifference to his cultural heritage is a crime. Brik&#x27;s complaints are, in my opinion, justified...&quot;
In 1938, she married writer Vasily Abgarovich Katanyan and they spent forty years together.

Lilya Brik died by suicide at the age of 86 when she was terminally ill. She left sculptures and writings. Recently published letters between the sisters in the course of more than five decades (except six years of World War II) reveal insights into life and cultural exchange across the Iron Curtain.

==NKVD agent==
Speculations about Lilya&#x27;s and Osip&#x27;s involvement with the NKVD and State Political Directorate started during their lifetime. According to the Swedish critic and Mayakovsky&#x27;s biographer , Boris Pasternak once told Roman Jakobson that Lilya Brik &quot;frightened&quot; him by saying that her guests would start supper &quot;right after Osya returns from Cheka&quot;, and that he later called their apartment &quot;Moscow police department&quot;. There&#x27;s also a well-known story how someone – supposedly Sergei Yesenin – wrote a joke poem on Briks&#x27; doors with chalk that read &quot;You think that Brik lives here, a language specialist? A fink lives here and a сhekist&quot;. Anna Akhmatova also called the house of Briks &quot;a saloon where writers met with chekists&quot; according to Lydia Chukovskaya.

In her memoirs the artist Elizaveta Lavinskaya, a friend of Briks and Mayakovsky, mentions that at some point new persons started visiting the LEF meetings, including Yakov Agranov, Zakhar Volovich and some other people later identified as high-ranking NKVD officers. A number of people also speculated about the sexual relationships between Lylia and Agranov, including the Soviet ballet dancer Maya Plisetskaya in her book. However, film director , the son of Lylia&#x27;s third husband Vasily Katanyan, said Brik personally denied those &quot;fantasies&quot; that &quot;started circulating after Agranov&#x27;s execution&quot;.

In 1990, when closed archives became available, an investigative journalist Valentin Skoryatin published an article in No. 5 titled &quot;Who, me, shot myself? You don&#x27;t say!&quot; where he talked about the mysterious death of Mayakovsky and the inheritance Lilya received after he died. He also made public the NKVD serial numbers of both Osip and Lilya Brik (No. 24541 and No. 15073 respectively). Osip received his ID of the 7th secret department in 1920, while his wife was granted it in 1922. The article was later published as part of the book &quot;The Mystery of Vladimir Mayakovsky&#x27;s Death. New Version of the Tragic Events Based on the Late Archive Findings&quot;.

==Influence==

There were attempts to present her as greedy and manipulative femme fatale, but those who knew her noted her altruism and intelligence. She helped many aspiring talents and was acquainted with many leading figures of Russian and international culture, such as Sergei Eisenstein, Lev Kuleshov, Boris Pasternak, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Kazimir Malevich, Sergei Paradjanov, Maya Plisetskaya, Rodion Shchedrin, Andrei Voznesensky, Yves St. Laurent and Pablo Picasso.
Lilya Brik&#x27;s idiomatically posed portrait appeared on the cover of LEF magazine (Leftist Front of Arts) in the 1920s, a magazine concerning Dada and Constructivist art. The portrait, designed by Alexander Rodchenko, has been reworked into other designs, including as cover art for Franz Ferdinand (album &quot;You Could Have It So Much Better&quot;, 2004), Beyoncé and Robyn.

<text>Osip Maksimovich Brik (; – 22 February 1945) was a Russian avant garde writer and literary critic, who was one of the most important members of the Russian formalist school, though he also identified himself as one of the Futurists.

== Life and career ==
Brik was born and grew up in Moscow, the son of a wealthy Jewish jeweler. In the university, Brik studied law; his friend Roman Jakobson wrote: &quot;For his doctoral thesis he wanted to write about the sociology and juridical status of prostitutes and would frequent the boulevards. All the prostitutes there knew him, and he always defended them, for free, in all their affairs, in their confrontations with the police and so on.&quot; But he soon found himself far more interested in poetry and poetics and devoted all his time to it, becoming one of the founders of OPOJAZ and writing one of the first important formalist studies of sounds in poetry, Zvukovye povtory (&quot;Sound repetitions,&quot; 1917). 

He had a strongly anti-author stance, once going so far as to say that if Pushkin had not written &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, somebody else would have; he wrote that &quot;there are no poets or literary figures, there is poetry and literature.&quot; He was also interested in photography and film: &quot;In 1918, Brik was a member of IZO Narkompros (Visual Arts Section of the People&#x27;s Committee for Education). ... Brik was especially close to Alexander Rodchenko and did much to make his photographic work known.&quot; He was also active in films and wrote several screenplays, including one for &quot;Potomok Cingis-khana&quot; (&quot;The Descendant of Genghis Khan&quot;) (with Ivan Novokshonov), directed by Vsevolod Pudovkin (1928).

He met his future wife, Lilya Kagan, when he was 17 and she 14; they were married on 26 March 1912. (Her sister Elsa was a notable French writer and married to Louis Aragon)
The daughter of a prosperous Jewish jurist, the handsome, erotically obsessed, highly cultivated Lili grew up with an overwhelming ambition prevalent among women of the Russian intelligentsia: to be perpetuated in human memory by being the muse of a famous poet. ... The two made a pact to love each other &quot;in the Chernyshevsky manner&quot; – a reference to one of nineteenth-century Russia&#x27;s most famous radical thinkers, who was an early advocate of &quot;open marriages.&quot; Living at the heart of an artistic bohemia and receiving the intelligentsia in the salon of his delectable wife, Osip Brik, true to his promise, calmly accepted his wife&#x27;s infidelities from the start. In fact, upon hearing his wife confess that she had gone to bed with the famous young poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, Brik exclaimed &quot;How could you refuse anything to that man?&quot; ... In 1918, when Mayakovsky and the Briks became inseparable, he simply moved in with them. Throughout the rest of his life, he made his home at a succession of flats that the Briks occupied.
Mayakovsky&#x27;s sexual relationship with Lili lasted from 1917 to 1923, and afterwards he continued to have a close friendship with the couple: &quot;For the rest of his life, &#x27;Osia&#x27; Brik remained the poet&#x27;s most trusted adviser, his most fervent proselytizer, and also a co-founder with him of the most dynamic avant-garde journal of the early Soviet era, &quot;Left Front of Art&quot;,&quot; or LEF, which was also an official publication for the group with the same name, and a platform for Russian Constructivist art.

Brik was not only a literary modernist, he was strongly left-wing in politics. In December 1918 Brik was involved with Mayakovsky in discussions with the Vyborg District party school of the Russian Communist Party (RKP(b)) to set up a Futurist organisation affiliated to the party. Named Komfut the organisation was formally founded in January 1919, but was swiftly dissolved following the intervention of Anatoly Lunacharsky.

Later, on 8 June 1920, he joined the Cheka. Jakobson wrote of this period:
It was from Bogatyrev, who visited me in Prague in December 1921, that I learned Brik was in the Cheka. And he told me that Pasternak, who often visited the Briks, had said to him: &quot;Still, it&#x27;s become rather terrifying. You come in, and Lili says: &#x27;Wait a while, we&#x27;ll have dinner as soon as Osja comes back from the Cheka.&#x27;&quot; At the end of 1922 I met the Briks in Berlin. Osja said to me: &quot;Now there&#x27;s an institution where a man loses his sentimentality,&quot; and began relating to me several rather bloody episodes. This was the first time he made a rather repulsive impression on me. Working in the Cheka had ruined him.
After Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rise to power, the Communist regime openly encouraged exclusively socialist realism methods and initiated a campaign to stamp out all culture the Communist Party perceived as dangerous. Most avant garde artists and thinkers suffered persecution, and Brik did not escape this fate. In the 1930s he eked out a living writing articles on Mayakovsky and book reviews; he died in 1945 of a heart attack while climbing the stairs to his Moscow apartment. His works were not republished in Russia until the mid-1990s. Edward J. Brown summed his career up thus: &quot;He wrote little, but his articles on poetic form ... are brilliant formalist analyses of poetic language... and he was probably the most articulate exponent in Lef of the theories of &#x27;social demand&#x27; and &#x27;literature of fact.&#x27; A man of surpassing intelligence, he was apparently not strong either in performance or in principle.&quot;

<text>Chester-le-Street () is a market town in County Durham, England. It is located around north of Durham and is close to Newcastle. The town holds markets on Saturdays. In 2021, the town had a population of 23,555.

The town&#x27;s history is ancient; records date to a Roman-built fort called Concangis. The Roman fort is the &quot;Chester&quot; (from the Latin &quot;castra&quot;) of the town&#x27;s name; the &quot;Street&quot; refers to the paved Roman road that ran north–south through the town. The parish church of St Mary and St Cuthbert is where the body of St Cuthbert remained for 112 years, before being transferred to Durham Cathedral. 
An Old English translation of the Gospels was made in the 10th century: a word-for-word gloss of the Latin Vulgate text, inserted between the lines by Aldred the Scribe, who was Provost of Chester-le-Street. 
==History==

=== Toponymy ===
The Romans founded a fort named &quot;Concangis&quot; or &quot;Concagium&quot;, which was a Latinisation of the original Celtic name for the area, which also gave name to the waterway through the town, Cong Burn. The precise name is uncertain as it does not appear in Roman records, but &quot;Concangis&quot; is the name most cited today. Although a meaning &quot;Place of the horse people&quot; has been given, scholarly authorities consider the meaning of the name obscure.

Old English forms of the name include &quot;Cuneceastra&quot; and &quot;Conceastre&quot;, which takes its first two syllables from the Roman name, with the addition of the Old English word &quot;ceaster&quot; &#x27;Roman fortification&#x27;. The &quot;Universal Etymological English Dictionary&quot; of 1749 gives the town as &quot;Chester upon Street&quot; (and describes it as &quot;a Village in the Bishoprick of Durham&quot;). At some point this was shortened to the modern form.

=== Town biography ===
There is evidence of Iron Age use of the River Wear near the town, Concangis was built alongside the Roman road Cade&#x27;s Road (now Front Street) and close to the River Wear, around 100 A.D., and was occupied until the Romans left Britain in 410 A.D. At the time, the Wear was navigable to at least Concangis and may also have provided food for the garrisons stationed there.

After the Romans left, there is no record of who lived there, until 883, when a group of monks, driven out of Lindisfarne seven years earlier, stopped there to build a wooden shrine and church to St Cuthbert, whose body they had borne with them. It became the seat of the Bishop of Lindisfarne, making the church a cathedral. There, the monks translated the Lindisfarne Gospels into English. They stayed for 112 years, leaving in 995 for a safer home in Durham. The title has been revived as the Roman Catholic titular see of Cuncacestre.

The church was rebuilt in stone in 1054 and, despite the loss of its bishopric, seems to have retained a degree of wealth and influence. In 1080, most of the huts in the town were burned and many people killed in retaliation for the death of Walcher, the first prince-bishop, at the hands of an English mob. The region was not recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086.

Cade&#x27;s Road did not fall out of use but was hidden beneath later roads which became the Great North Road, the main route from London and the south to Newcastle and Edinburgh. The town&#x27;s location on the road played a significant role in its development, as well as its name, as inns sprang up to cater for the travelling trade. This trade reached a peak in the early 19th century as more people and new mail services were carried by stagecoach, before declining as railways became more popular. The town was bypassed when the A167 road was routed around the town and this was later supplanted by the A1(M) motorway.

From the late 17th century onwards, coal was dug in increasing quantities in the region. At the same time, the growth of the mines and the influx of miners supported local businesses, not just the many inns but new shops and services, themselves bringing in more people to work in them. These people would later work in new industries established in the town to take advantage of its good communications and access to raw materials.

On the evening of 5 October 1936, the Jarrow Marchers stopped at the town centre after their first day&#x27;s walk. The church hall was used to house them before they continued onward the following day.

==Governance==

From 1894 until 2009, local government districts were governed from the town. From 1894 to 1974, it had a rural district, which covered the town and outlying villages. In 1909, the inner rural district formed an urban district, which covered the town as it was at that time.

By 1974, the town expanded out of the urban district, during that year&#x27;s reforms the urban and rural districts, as well as other areas formed a non-metropolitan district. It was abolished in 2009 reforms when the non-metropolitan county became a unitary authority.

==Climate==
The town has a mild climate and gets well below average rainfall relative to the UK. It does though experience occasional floods. To the east of the town lies the Riverside cricket ground and Riverside Park. They were built on the flood plains of the River Wear, and are often flooded when the river bursts its banks. The town centre is subject to occasional flash flooding, usually after very heavy rain over the town and surrounding areas, if the rain falls too quickly for it to be drained away by Cong Burn. The flooding occurs at the bottom of Front Street where the Cong Burn passes under the street, after it was enclosed in concrete in 1932.

==Landmarks==

John Leland described Chester-le-Street in the 1530s as &quot;Chiefly one main street of very mean building in height.&quot;, a sentiment echoed by Daniel Defoe.

===Chester Burn viaduct===

The viaduct to the northwest of the town centre was completed in 1868 for the North Eastern Railway, to enable trains to travel at high speed on a more direct route between Newcastle and Durham. It is over 230m long with 11 arches, now spanning a road and supermarket car-park, and is a Grade II listed structure.

===Lumley Castle===
Lumley Castle was built in 1389. It is on the eastern bank of the River Wear and overlooks the town and the Riverside Park.

===The Queens Head Hotel===
The Queens Head Hotel is located in the central area of the Front Street. It was built over 250 years ago when Front Street formed part of the main route from Edinburgh and Newcastle to London and the south of England. A Grade II listed building, it is set back from the street and is still one of the largest buildings in the town centre.

===The Post Office===

Chester-le-Street Post Office at 137 Front Street is in Art Deco style and replaced a smaller building located on the corner of Relton Terrace and Ivanhoe Terrace. It opened in 1936 and is unusual in that it is one of a handful of post offices that display the royal cypher from the brief reign of Edward VIII.

==Religious sites==
===St Mary and St Cuthbert Church===
St Mary and St Cuthbert church possesses a rare surviving 14th century anchorage, one of the best-preserved in the country. It was occupied by six anchorites from 1383 to c. 1538 and its walled-up cell had only a slit from which the anchorite could observe the altar and receive food, while outside was an open grave for when the occupant died. It is now a museum known as the Anker&#x27;s House. The north aisle is occupied by a line of Lumley family effigies, only five genuine, assembled circa 1590. Some have been chopped off to fit and resemble a casualty station at Agincourt, according to Sir Simon Jenkins in his &quot;England&#x27;s Thousand Best Churches&quot;. This and Lumley Castle are Chester-le-Street&#x27;s only Grade I listed buildings.

===Bethel United Reformed Church===

The small United Reformed Church on Low Chare, just off the main Front Street, was built in 1814 as the Bethel Congregational Chapel and remodelled in 1860. It is still in use and is a Grade II listed building.

==Sport==

===Cricket===
The Riverside Ground, known for sponsorship reasons as the Seat Unique Riverside, is home to Durham County Cricket Club which became a first class county in 1992. Since 1999, the ground has hosted many international fixtures, usually involving the England cricket team. The ground was also host to two fixtures at the 1999 Cricket World Cup, and three fixtures at the 2019 Cricket World Cup.
The town also has its own cricket club, Chester-le-Street Cricket Club based at the Ropery Lane ground. They are the current Champions of the North East Premier League, won the national ECB 45 over tournament in 2009 and reached the quarter-final of the national 20/20 club championship in 2009.

===Rowing===
Chester-le-Street Amateur Rowing Club is based on the River Wear near the Riverside cricket ground and has been there for over 100 years. During the summer months the club operate mainly on the river, but in the winter move to indoor sessions during the evenings and use the river at weekends.

The club has over 160 members of which 90 are junior members, with numbers increasing annually. The club are well thought of by British Rowing as a lead club for junior development with many juniors now competing at GB level, and some competing for GB at international events.

===Football===
Medieval football was once played in the town. The game was played annually on Shrove Tuesday between the &quot;Upstreeters&quot; and &quot;Downstreeters&quot;. Play started at 1 pm and finished at 6 pm. To start the game, the ball was thrown from a window in the centre of the town and in one game more than 400 players took part. The centre of the street was the dividing line and the winner was the side where the ball was (Up or Down) at 6 pm. It was played from the Middle Ages until 1932, when it was outlawed by the police and people trying to carry on the tradition were arrested. Chester-le-Street United F.C. were founded in 2020 and compete in the Northern Football League Division Two. In the 2022/23 season they finished above their local rivals Chester-le-Street Town F.C. who were founded in 1972 and compete in the Northern Football League Division Two and based just outside Chester-le-street in Chester Moor.

==Transport==

===Railway===

Chester-le-Street railway station is a stop on the East Coast Main Line of the National Rail network between Newcastle and Durham; it opened in 1868. The station is served by two train operating companies:

* TransPennine Express provides services between , , , , and ;
* Northern Trains runs a limited service in early mornings and evenings; destinations include Newcastle, and .

The station is managed by Northern Trains.

The town is mentioned in the 1963 song &quot;Slow Train&quot; by Flanders and Swann:&quot;&lt;poem&gt;
No churns, no porter, no cat on a seat,
At Chorlton-cum-Hardy or Chester-le-Street.&lt;/poem&gt;&quot;

===Buses===
Chester-le-Street&#x27;s bus services are operated primarily by Go North East and Arriva North East; routes connect the town with Newcastle, Durham, Middlesbrough and Seaham.

The town is the original home of The Northern General Transport Company, which has since grown into Go North East; it operated from the Picktree Lane Depot until 2023 when it was demolished. It also pioneered the use of Minilink bus services in the North East in 1985.
===Roads===
Front Street first carried the A1 road, between London and Edinburgh, through the town. A bypass was built in the 1950s, which still exists today as the A167. The bypass road itself was partly bypassed by, and partly incorporated in, the A1(M) motorway in the 1970s.

The northern end of Front Street was once the start of the A6127, which is the road that would continue through Birtley, Gateshead and eventually over the Tyne Bridge; it become the A6127(M) central motorway in Newcastle upon Tyne. However, when the Gateshead-Newcastle Western Bypass of the A1(M) was opened, many roads in this area were renumbered; they followed the convention that roads originating between single digit A roads take their first digit from the single digit A road in an anticlockwise direction from their point of origin. Newcastle Road, which was formerly designated A1, is now unclassified. The A6127 was renamed the A167. Car traffic is now banned from the northern part of Front Street and it is restricted to buses, cyclists and delivery vehicles.

<text>Kaitoke (sometimes called Pakuratahi), part of Upper Hutt City, is a locality in the southern North Island of New Zealand. It is located at the northern end of the Hutt Valley, 45 kilometres northeast of Wellington City and six kilometres from the northern end of the Upper Hutt urban area. It also lies at the southern end of the Tararua Ranges.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;eat worms&quot; for &quot;Kaitoke&quot;.

The &quot;Puffer&quot; tramping track providing access into the Tararua Forest Park climbs from Kaitoke onto and along the Marchant Ridge. This ridge is the part of the Tararuas that is prominently visible from Wellington. The Marchant Track has a side track leading to the Tauherenikau Valley. The end of the Marchant Ridge (after four hours of &#x27;up hill, all the way, both ways&#x27;) leads to Mount Alpha, and onto The Southern Crossing. The entire track to Alpha skirts the Hutt Water Collection Area.

The first Youth Hostel in the North Island was established in the old Ministry of Works barracks at Kaitoke, which were behind the Post Office and alongside the Kaitoke Hall. The Post Office, the Hall, and the Youth Hostel were the only buildings of the settlement. Other facilities include a small airstrip operated by the Upper Valley Gliding Club for the purposes of gliding the area&#x27;s thermals.

The Pakuratahi River flows through the eastern Kaitoke Basin from its source in the Remutaka Ranges. The old route of the Wairarapa Line railway, which closed with the opening of the Rimutaka Tunnel in November 1955, ran from Upper Hutt via Maymorn to Kaitoke and around Goat Rock up the Pakuratahi to the Summit, and from there, because of excessive steepness, the Fell mountain railway system was used to aid trains on the Rimutaka Incline between Summit and Cross Creek. This railway is now the Remutaka Rail Trail. The Hutt River has its source to the north of Kaitoke, and much of the land in the vicinity is used as a water supply reserve. Filming, rafting, swimming and other human activity all take place downstream of the water intake.

The nearby Kaitoke Regional Park was the filming location for exterior shots of Rivendell for the movie &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;.

<text>Vladimir Yevgrafovich Tatlin ( – 31 May 1953) was a Russian and Soviet painter, architect, and stage-designer. Tatlin achieved fame as the architect who designed The Monument to the Third International, more commonly known as Tatlin&#x27;s Tower, which he began in 1919. With Kazimir Malevich he was one of the two most important figures in the Soviet avant-garde art movement of the 1920s, and he later became an important artist in the constructivist movement.

==Biography==

Vladimir Yevgrafovich Tatlin was born in Moscow or Kharkiv, Russian Empire. His father, Yevgraf Nikoforovich Tatlin was a hereditary nobleman from Oryol, a mechanical engineer graduated from the Technological Institute in St.Petersburg and employed by the Moscow-Brest Railway in Moscow. His mother, Nadezhda Nikolaevna Tatlina (Bart) was a poet who sympathized with the Narodnaya Volya revolutionary movement. After she died in 1887, his father married again and resettled to Kharkiv. His father, by whom he lived after having failed to study in Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture died in 1904, so young Vladimir had to interrupt his studies at the Kharkov Arts School and to leave for Odesa to become a merchant sea cadet. According to his own memories, sea and distant lands gave him both means of subsistence and source of inspiration; he sailed all across the Black Sea and also to Egypt.

In 1905 he started and in 1910 successfully completed his studies at N. Selivestrov Penza Art School in Penza. During the summer vacations he traveled to Moscow and St. Petersburg to participate in various art events. In 1911 he resettled to Moscow to live by his uncle and began his art career as an icon painter. He also played the bandura, a Ukrainian folk instrument he picked up when living in Kharkov, and performed abroad as a professional bandurist, accompanying his own singing in Ukrainian.

Tatlin became familiar with the work of Pablo Picasso during a trip to Paris in 1913.

Tatlin achieved fame as the architect who designed the huge monument to the Third International, also known as Tatlin&#x27;s Tower. Tatlin began to design it in 1919. The monument was to be a tall tower made of iron, glass and steel which would have dwarfed the Eiffel Tower in Paris (the Monument to the Third International was a third taller at 400 meters high). Inside the iron-and-steel structure of twin spirals, the design envisaged three building blocks, covered with glass windows, which would rotate at different speeds (the first one, a cube, once a year; the second one, a pyramid, once a month; the third one, a cylinder, once a day). The entire building was to house the executive and legislature of the Comintern, and be a central area for the creation and dissemination of propaganda. For financial and practical reasons, however, the tower was never built.

Tatlin was also regarded as a progenitor of Soviet post-revolutionary constructivist art with his pre-revolutionary counter-reliefs, three-dimensional constructions made of wood and metal, some placed in corners (corner counter-reliefs) and others more conventionally. Tatlin conceived these sculptures in order to question the traditional ideas of art, though he did not regard himself as a constructivist and objected to many of the movement&#x27;s ideas. Later prominent constructivists included Varvara Stepanova, Alexander Rodchenko, Manuel Rendón Seminario, Joaquín Torres García, László Moholy-Nagy, Antoine Pevsner and Naum Gabo.

Although colleagues at the beginning of their careers, Tatlin and Malevich quarrelled fiercely and publicly at the time of the 0.10 Exhibition in 1915 (long before the birth of constructivism), also called &quot;the last futurist exhibition&quot;, apparently over the &#x27;suprematist&#x27; works Malevich exhibited there. This led Malevich to develop his ideas further in the city of Vitebsk, where he found a school called UNOVIS (Champions of the New Art).

Tatlin also dedicated himself to the study of clothes, and various objects, and flight, culminating in the construction of Letatlin personal flying apparatus.

Tatlin taught and directed the theatre, film and photography department at the Kyiv Art Institute from 1925 to 1927. In 1930 he taught in Kyiv where one of his students was Joseph Karakis.

From the 1930s Tatlin worked for different theatres in Moscow and during the Great Patriotic War, in Gorky (Nizhny Novgorod). He also worked for and with many Soviet art organizations, including the department of Fine Arts (IZO) of Narkompros.

In 1948 he was heavily criticized for his allegedly anti-communist stance and lost his job, but was not repressed.

Tatlin died in 1953 in Moscow and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

<text>DMX512 is a standard for digital communication networks that are commonly used to control lighting and effects. It was originally intended as a standardized method for controlling stage lighting dimmers, which, prior to DMX512, had employed various incompatible proprietary protocols. It quickly became the primary method for linking controllers (such as a lighting console) to dimmers and special effects devices such as fog machines and intelligent lights. 

DMX512 has also expanded to uses in non-theatrical interior and architectural lighting, at scales ranging from strings of Christmas lights to electronic billboards and stadium or arena concerts. It can now be used to control almost anything, reflecting its popularity in all types of venues. 

DMX512 uses a unidirectional EIA-485 (RS-485) differential signaling at its physical layer, in conjunction with a variable-size, packet-based communication protocol. DMX512 does not include automatic error checking and correction and therefore is not an appropriate control for hazardous applications, such as pyrotechnics or movement of theatrical rigging. However, it is still used for such applications. False triggering may be caused by electromagnetic interference, static electricity discharges, improper cable termination, excessively long cables, or poor quality cables.

The DMX standard is published by the Entertainment Services and Technology Association (ESTA), and can be downloaded from its website.

== History ==
Developed by the Engineering Commission of United States Institute for Theatre Technology (USITT), the DMX512 standard (for digital multiplex with 512 pieces of information) was created in 1986, with subsequent revisions in 1990 leading to USITT DMX512/1990.

=== DMX512-A ===
In 1998 the ESTA began a revision process to develop the standard as an ANSI standard. The resulting revised standard, known officially as &quot;Entertainment Technology—USITT DMX512-A—Asynchronous Serial Digital Data Transmission Standard for Controlling Lighting Equipment and Accessories&quot;, was approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in November 2004. It was revised again in 2008, and is the current standard known as &quot;E1.11 – 2008, USITT DMX512-A&quot;, or just &quot;DMX512-A&quot;.

== Network topology ==
A DMX512 network employs a multi-drop bus topology with nodes strung together in what is commonly called a daisy chain. A network consists of a single DMX512 controller – which is the master of the network — and one or more slave devices. For example, a lighting console is frequently employed as the controller for a network of slave devices such as dimmers, fog machines and intelligent lights.

Each slave device has a DMX512 &quot;IN&quot; connector and usually an &quot;OUT&quot; (or &quot;THRU&quot;) connector as well. The controller, which usually has only an OUT connector, is connected via a DMX512 cable to the IN connector of the first slave. A second cable then links the OUT or THRU connector of the first slave to the IN connector of the next slave in the chain, and so on. For example, the block diagram below shows a simple network consisting of a controller and three slaves. 

The specification requires a &#x27;terminator&#x27; to be connected to the final OUT or THRU connector of the last slave on the daisy chain, which would otherwise be unconnected. A terminator is a stand-alone male connector with an integral resistor connected across the primary data signal pair; this resistor matches the cable&#x27;s characteristic impedance. If a secondary data pair is used, a termination resistor is connected across it as well. Although simple systems (&quot;i.e.&quot;, systems having few devices and short cables) will sometimes function normally without a terminator, the standard requires its use. Some DMX slave devices have built-in terminators that can be manually activated with a mechanical switch or by software, or by automatically sensing the absence of a connected cable.

A DMX512 network is called a &quot;DMX universe&quot;. Each OUT connector on a DMX512 controller can control a single universe. A DMX512 universe is made up of 512 channels, with each channel containing a value between 0 and 255. Each slave device in the chain can &quot;look at&quot; a different set of channels in order to be controlled by the master controller. Smaller controllers may have a single OUT connector, enabling them to control only one universe, whereas large control desks (operator consoles) may have the capacity to control multiple universes, with an OUT connector provided for each universe. Many of the more modern control desks instead of featuring multiple OUT connectors have an unshielded twisted pair connector (such as Cat 5, Cat 5e or Cat 6). Such cables and systems can control up to 524,288 universes of DMX512 (32,768 subnets × 16 universes per subnet) using the Art-Net IV protocol, or 65,536 universes using the sACN protocol, and the existing Ethernet in buildings.

== Physical layer ==

=== Electrical ===
DMX512 data is transmitted over a differential pair using EIA-485 voltage levels. DMX512 electrical specifications are identical to those of the EIA-485-A standard, except where stated otherwise in E1.11.

DMX512 is a bus network no more than long, with not more than 32 unit loads (individual devices connected) on a single bus. If more than 32 unit loads need to communicate, the network can be expanded across parallel buses using DMX splitters. Network wiring consists of a shielded twisted pair, with a characteristic impedance of , with a termination resistor at the end of the cable furthest from the controller to absorb signal reflections. DMX512 has two twisted pair data paths, although the specification currently only defines the use of one of the twisted pairs. The second pair is undefined but required by the electrical specification.

The E1.11 (DMX512 2004) electrical specification addresses the connection of DMX512 signal common to earth ground. Specifically, the standard recommends that transmitter ports (DMX512 controller OUT port) have a low impedance connection between signal common and ground; such ports are referred to as &quot;grounded&quot;. It is further recommended that receivers have a high impedance connection between signal common and ground; such ports are referred to as &quot;isolated&quot;.

The standard also allows for isolated transmitter ports and non-isolated receivers. It also recommends that systems ground the signal common at only one point, in order to avoid the formation of disruptive ground loops.

Grounded receivers that have a hard connection between signal common and ground are permitted but their use is strongly discouraged. Several possible grounding configurations that are commonly used with EIA485 are specifically disallowed by E1.11.

=== Connectors ===
The original DMX512 1990 specified that where connectors are used, the data link shall use five-pin XLR style electrical connectors (XLR-5), with female connectors used on transmitting (OUT) ports and male connectors on receiving ports.
The use of any other XLR-style connector is prohibited.

The three-pin XLR connector is commonly used for DMX512, on lighting and related control equipment, particularly at the budget/DJ end of the market. However, using three-pin XLR connectors for DMX512 is specifically prohibited by section 7.1.2 of the DMX512 standard. Use of the three-pin XLR in this context firstly presents a risk of damage to the lighting equipment should an audio cable carrying 48-volt phantom power be accidentally connected. Three-pin XLR designed for audio applications rather than DMX512 communications may also lead to signal degradation and unreliable operation of the DMX network.

DMX512-A (ANSI E1.11-2008) defined the use of eight-pin modular (8P8C, or &quot;RJ-45&quot;) connectors for fixed installations where regular plugging and unplugging of equipment is not required. Several manufacturers used other pinouts for RJ-45 connectors prior to this inclusion in the standard.

Other form-factors of connectors are permitted on equipment where the XLR and RJ-45 would not fit or are considered inappropriate, for example on equipment intended for permanent installation.

From ANSI E1.11 - 2008 section 7:
==== XLR-5 pinout ====
# Signal Common
# Data 1- (Primary Data Link)
# Data 1+ (Primary Data Link)
# Data 2- (Optional Secondary Data Link)
# Data 2+ (Optional Secondary Data Link)

==== RJ-45 pinout ====
# Data 1+
# Data 1-
# Data 2+
# Not Assigned
# Not Assigned
# Data 2-
# Signal Common (0 V) for Data 1
# Signal Common (0 V) for Data 2

The 8P8C modular connector pinout matches the conductor pairing scheme used by Category 5 (Cat5) twisted pair patch cables. The avoidance of pins 4 and 5 helps to prevent equipment damage, if the cabling is accidentally plugged into a single-line public switched telephone network phone jack.

==== Common non-compliant connectors ====
In the early days of digital lighting control, equipment manufacturers employed various connectors and pinouts for their proprietary digital control signals. The most common of these was the three-pin XLR connector (also called &quot;cannon&quot; jack in some countries). When DMX512 was ratified, many of these manufacturers then issued firmware updates to enable the use of DMX512 control on their existing equipment by the use of a simple adapter to and from the standard 5-pin XLR style connector.

As the electrical specification currently only defines a purpose for a single wire pair, some equipment manufacturers continue to use it. Such equipment is not compliant with the DMX standard, but may be sufficiently compatible for operation using simple adapters.

There is a risk of equipment damage if 3-pin XLR audio and DMX signals are plugged into each other. 

===== XLR-3 pinout =====

Section 7 of ANSI E1.11 - 2008 prohibits the use of XLR-3 connectors with DMX512. However, in practice XLR-3 has become a de facto standard in the lighting industry with the following pinout commonly seen:

# Ground
# Data 1-
# Data 1+

Since DMX512 over XLR-3 is not officially standardised, there may be devices which use other pinouts.

===== Other RJ-45 pinouts =====
Color Kinetics has their own version of the RJ-45 connector for DMX, which predates the 2008 official inclusion in the DMX512 standard. The pinout specifically for Color Kinetics LED lighting products is:

# Data 1-
# Data 1+
# Shield
# Optional
# Optional
# Optional
# Optional
# Optional

=== Cabling ===
The standard cables used in DMX512 networks employ XLR5 connectors, with a male connector on one end and a female connector on the other end. The cable&#x27;s male connector attaches to the transmitting, female jack (OUT), and its female connector attaches to the receiving, male jack (IN).

Cabling for DMX512 was removed from the ANSI E1.11 standard and a separate cabling standards project was started in 2003. Two cabling standards have been developed, one for portable DMX512 cables (ANSI E1.27-1 – 2006) and one for permanent installations (draft standard BSR E1.27-2). This resolved issues arising from the differences in requirements for cables used in touring shows versus those used for permanent infrastructure.

The electrical characteristics of DMX512 cable are specified in terms of impedance and capacitance, although there are often mechanical and other considerations that must be considered as well. Cable types that are appropriate for DMX512 usage will have a nominal characteristic impedance of . Also, cables designed for EIA485 typically meet the DMX512 electrical specifications. Conversely, microphone and line-level audio cables lack the requisite electrical characteristics and thus are not suitable for DMX512 cabling. The significantly lower impedance and higher capacitance of these cables distort the DMX512 digital waveforms, which in turn can cause irregular operation or intermittent errors that are difficult to identify and correct.

Cat5 cable, commonly used for networking and telecommunications, has been tested by ESTA for use with DMX512A. RJ45 connectors are used by some DMX-compatible hardware with ESTA standard or proprietary pinouts.

== Protocol ==
At the data link layer, a DMX512 controller transmits asynchronous serial data at 250 kbit/s. The data format is fixed at one start bit, eight data bits (least significant first), two stop bits and no parity.

Each frame consists of:
* Break condition
* Mark-After-Break
* Slot 0, containing the one-byte Start Code
* Up to 512 slots of channel data, each containing one byte

The start of a packet is signified by a break followed by a &quot;mark&quot; (a logical one), known as the &quot;Mark After Break&quot; (MAB). The break, which signals the end of one packet and the start of another, causes receivers to start reception and also serves as a frame (position reference) for data bytes within the packet. Framed data bytes are known as &quot;slots&quot;. Following the break, up to 513 slots are sent.

The first slot is reserved for a &quot;Start Code&quot; that specifies the type of data in the packet. A start code of 0x00 (hexadecimal zero) is the standard value used for all DMX512 compatible devices, which includes most lighting fixtures and dimmers. Other start codes are used for Text packets (0x17), System Information Packets (0xCF), for the RDM extension to DMX (0xCC), and various proprietary systems. ESTA maintains a database of alternate start codes.

All slots following the start code contain control settings for slave devices. A slot&#x27;s position within the packet determines the device and function to be controlled while its data value specifies the control set point.

=== Timing ===
DMX512 timing parameters may vary over a wide range. The original authors specified the standard this way to provide the greatest design flexibility. Because of this, however, it was difficult to design receivers that operated over the entire timing range. As a result of this difficulty, the timing specification of the original 1986 standard was changed in 1990. Specifically, the MAB, which was originally fixed at 4 μs, was changed to 8 μs, minimum. The E1.11 (2004) standard relaxed the transmitter and receiver timing specifications. This relaxed the timing requirements for systems using controllers built to DMX512-A (E1.11); however, a significant number of legacy devices still employ transmit timing near the minimum end of the range.

Maximum times are not specified because as long as a packet is sent at least once per second, the BREAK, MAB, inter-slot time, and the mark between the last slot of the packet and the break (MBB) can be as long as desired.

A maximum-sized packet, which has 512 &quot;channels&quot; (slots following the start code), takes approximately 23 ms to send, corresponding to a maximum refresh rate of about 44 Hz. For higher refresh rates, packets having fewer than 512 channels can be sent.

The standard does not specify the minimum number of slots that can be sent in a packet. However, it does require that packets be transmitted so that the leading edges of any two sequential BREAKs must be separated by at least 1204 μs, and receivers must be able to handle packets with break-to-break times as short as 1196 μs. The minimum break-to-break transmit time can be achieved by sending packets that contain at least 24 slots (by adding extra padding bytes, if necessary) or by stretching parameters such as the BREAK, MAB, Interslot, or Interpacket times.

=== Addressing and data encoding ===
Most data is sent with the default Null Start Code of 00h. Quoting from the standard:
Dimmer packs or racks use a group of slots to determine the levels for their dimmers. Typically a dimmer has a starting address that represents the lowest-numbered dimmer in that pack, and the addressing increases from there to the highest-numbered dimmer. As an example, for two packs of six dimmers each, the first pack would start at address 1 and the second pack at address 7. Each slot in the DMX512 packet corresponds to one dimmer.

==== 8-bit v. 16-bit ====
DMX does not mandate a method of 16-bit encoding for Null Start Code packets; however, many parameters of moving lights make use of encoding larger than 8-bit numbers. To control these parameters more accurately, some fixtures use two channels for parameters that require greater accuracy. The first of the two channels controls the coarse (256 steps for the whole range of movement) and the second the fine (256 steps for each coarse step), this gives a 16-bit value range of 65536 steps, permitting much greater accuracy for any 16-bit controlled parameter such as Pan or Tilt.

== DMX in practice ==
DMX512&#x27;s popularity is partly due to its robustness. The cable can be abused without any loss of function in ways that would render Ethernet or other high-speed data cables useless, although cable faults can occasionally lead to intermittent problems such as random triggering. Unexpected fixture behavior is caused by addressing errors, cable faults, incorrect data from the controller, or multiple DMX sources inadvertently applied to a single chain of fixtures.

=== Secondary data link ===
In the 1986 and 1990 standards the use of the second data pair is not defined other than as an ‘optional second data link’. Both unidirectional and bidirectional use were envisioned. Other proprietary uses have been implemented for these pins. Schemes that use voltage outside of the range allowed by EIA485 are disallowed. Guidance on allowed usage can be found in Annex B of E1.11. Current standard practice is to leave the secondary data link pins unused.

=== Connectors ===
DMX512-A specifies that the connector must be a five-pin XLR connector.

DMX512-A uses a single pair of conductors, so can be connected using the cheaper 3-pin XLR connectors. Some manufacturers made units with three-pin XLR connectors, because of their lower cost. However, as 3-pin XLRs are commonly used for connecting microphones and sound mixing consoles, there is a risk of wrongly connecting DMX512 equipment to microphones and other sound equipment. The +48 volt phantom power emitted by mixing consoles could damage DMX512 equipment if connected to it. The DMX512 signals emitted by lighting desks can damage microphones and other sound equipment if connected to it. As a result, the best practice is to use only 5-pin XLRs for DMX512 signals, to avoid risk of confusion with connectors used for sound signals.

=== Termination ===
The DMX512 signal lines require a single termination resistor to be fitted at the extreme end of the signal cable.
Some of the more common symptoms of improper termination are flashing, uncontrollable or incorrect light operation, or other undesired random special effects.

Some equipment has automatic termination, others a physical switch, while the remainder requires a physical terminator (e.g. male XLR-5 plug fitted with a resistor) to be installed by the user.

It is important for users to check whether their devices have automatic or switched termination, as otherwise they may end up with the DMX line being terminated multiple times or not at all when they believed it to be correct.

Additionally, terminating the DMX line often exposes physical cable faults - for example, if the &quot;Data −&quot; wire is broken, an unterminated DMX run may partially work, while fitting the terminator immediately exposes the problem.

=== Wireless operation ===
Recently, wireless DMX512 adapters have become popular, especially in architectural lighting installations where cable lengths can be prohibitively long. Such networks typically employ a wireless transmitter at the controller, with strategically placed receivers near the fixtures to convert the wireless signal back to conventional DMX512 wired network signals or wireless receivers built into the individual fixtures.

Although wireless DMX512 networks can function over distances exceeding under ideal conditions, most wireless DMX512 links are limited to a maximum distance of to ensure reliable operation. The first commercially marketed wireless DMX512 system was based on frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) technology using commercial wireless modems. Other later-generation systems still used frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) technology, but at higher bandwidth. FHSS systems tend to disturb other types of wireless communication systems such as WiFi/WLAN. This has been solved in newer wireless DMX systems by using adaptive frequency hopping, a technique to detect and avoid surrounding wireless systems, to avoid transmitting on occupied frequencies.

Multiple incompatible wireless protocols currently exist. While DMX-over-Ethernet protocols such as E1.31 - Streaming ACN can be used to send DMX data over WiFi, this is not generally recommended due to the highly variable latency of WiFi.

== Development ==
Many alternatives to DMX512 have been proposed to address limitations such as the maximum slot count of 512 per universe, the unidirectional signal, and the lack of inherent error detection. The 2004 DMX512-A revision added a System Information Packet (SIP). This packet can be interleaved with Null packets. One feature of SIPs is they allow checksums to be sent for DMX Null data. However, SIPs have rarely been implemented.

E1.11-2004, a revision of DMX512-A, also lays the foundation for Remote Device Management (RDM) protocol through the definition of Enhanced Functionality. RDM allows for diagnostic feedback from fixtures to the controller by extending the DMX512 standard to encompass bidirectional communication between the lighting controller and lighting fixtures. RDM was approved by ANSI in 2006 as ANSI E1.20 and is gaining interest.

An Ethernet-based protocol can distribute multiple DMX universes through a single cable from a control location to breakout boxes closer to fixtures. These boxes then output the conventional DMX512 signal. ANSI E1.31—2009 Entertainment Technology—Lightweight streaming protocol for transport of DMX512 using ACN, published May 4, 2009, and Art-Net are two free-to-use protocols used to achieve this.

<text>Major-General Patrick Ronayne Cleburne ( ; March 16, 1828November 30, 1864) was a senior officer in the Confederate States Army who commanded infantry in the Western Theater of the American Civil War.

Born in Ireland, Cleburne served in the 41st Regiment of Foot of the British Army after failing to gain entrance into Trinity College of Medicine, Dublin in 1846. He served at Fort Westmorland on Spike Island and was present on the island in 1849 when Queen Victoria visited Cork Harbour. Three years after joining the Army, he immigrated to the United States. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Cleburne sided with the Confederate States. He progressed from being a private soldier in the local militia to a division commander. He participated in many military campaigns, especially the Battle of Stones River, the Battle of Missionary Ridge and the Battle of Ringgold Gap. He was also present at the Battle of Shiloh. Known as the &quot;Stonewall of the West&quot;, Cleburne was killed leading his men at the Battle of Franklin.

==Early life==
Patrick Ronayne Cleburne was born in Ovens, County Cork, Ireland the second son of Dr. Joseph Cleburne, a middle-class physician of Protestant Anglo-Irish ancestry. Patrick&#x27;s mother died when he was 18 months old, and he was an orphan at 15. He followed his father into the study of medicine, but failed his entrance exam to Trinity College of Medicine in 1846. In response to this failure, he enlisted in the 41st Regiment of Foot of the British Army, subsequently rising to the rank of corporal. Cleburne served at Fort Westmorland on Spike Island in Cork Harbour, a large fortress that was then being used as a convict depot. Seeing the wretched state of those filling the prison cells during the Great Irish Famine, Cleburne was further motivated to emigrate with his family to America.

Three years after joining the British Army, Cleburne bought his discharge and emigrated to the United States with two brothers and a sister. After spending a short time in Ohio, he settled in Helena, Arkansas, where he was employed as a pharmacist and was readily accepted into the town&#x27;s social order. During this time, Cleburne became close friends with Thomas C. Hindman, who later paralleled his course as a Confederate major general. The two men also formed a business partnership with William Weatherly to buy a newspaper, the &quot;Democratic Star&quot;, in December 1855.

In 1856, Cleburne and Hindman were both wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena with members of the Know-Nothing Party following a debate. Cleburne was shot in the back, turned around and shot one of his attackers, killing him. The attackers hid until Cleburne collapsed on the street and then left. After the two recovered, they appeared before a grand jury to respond to all charges brought against them. They were exonerated, and afterward, went to Hindman&#x27;s parents&#x27; house in Mississippi. By 1860, he was a naturalized citizen, a practicing lawyer, and very popular with the local residents.

==American Civil War==
When the issue of secession reached a crisis, Cleburne sided with the Southern states. His choice was not due to any love of slavery, which he claimed not to care about, but out of affection for the Southern people who had adopted him as one of their own. As the crisis mounted, Cleburne joined the local militia company (Yell Rifles) as a private soldier. He was soon elected captain. He led the company in the seizure of the U.S. Arsenal at Little Rock in January 1861. When Arkansas left the Union, the Yell Rifles became part of the 1st Arkansas Infantry. Cleburne&#x27;s regiment was assigned to the force under William Hardee, training in northeast Arkansas and conducting brief operations in southeast Missouri before Hardee&#x27;s force was ordered to cross the Mississippi River and join Albert Sidney Johnston&#x27;s Army of Central Kentucky in the fall 1861. The 1st Arkansas was designated the 15th Arkansas in late 1861. Cleburne was promoted to brigadier general on March 4, 1862.

Johnston withdrew his army from Bowling Green, Kentucky, through Tennessee, and into Mississippi before electing to attack the invading Union forces under Ulysses S. Grant. Cleburne served at the Battle of Shiloh, leading a brigade on the left side of the Confederate line, as well as at the siege of Corinth. That fall, Cleburne and his men were transported to Tennessee in preparation of Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Confederate Heartland Offensive. In that campaign, Cleburne was loaned to Edmund Kirby Smith, whose smaller army led the invasion. At the Battle of Richmond (Kentucky), Cleburne was wounded in the face when a minie ball pierced his left cheek, smashed several teeth, and exited through his mouth, but he recovered in time to re-join Hardee and Bragg and participate in the Battle of Perryville. After the Army of Tennessee retreated to its namesake state in late 1862, Cleburne was promoted to division command and served at the Battle of Stones River, where his division advanced three miles as it routed the Union right wing and drove it back to the Nashville Pike and its final line of defense. He was promoted to major general on December 13.

During the campaigns of 1863 in Tennessee, Cleburne and his soldiers fought at the Battle of Chickamauga. They successfully resisted a much larger Union force under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman on the northern end of Missionary Ridge during the Battle of Missionary Ridge, and Joseph Hooker at the Battle of Ringgold Gap in northern Georgia, in which Cleburne&#x27;s men again protected the Army of Tennessee as it retreated to Tunnel Hill, Georgia. Cleburne and his troops received an official Thanks from the Confederate Congress for their actions during this campaign.

Cleburne&#x27;s strategic use of terrain, his ability to hold ground where others failed, and his talent in foiling the movements of the enemy earned him fame, and gained him the nickname &quot;Stonewall of the West.&quot; Federal troops were quoted as dreading to see the blue flag of Cleburne&#x27;s Division across the battlefield. General Robert E. Lee referred to him as &quot;a meteor shining from a clouded sky&quot;.

===Proposal for emancipation and enlistment of Blacks===
By late 1863, it had become obvious to Cleburne that the Confederacy was losing the war because of the growing limitations of its manpower and resources. In 1864, he dramatically called together the leadership of the Army of Tennessee and put forth the proposal to emancipate all slaves (&quot;emancipating the whole race upon reasonable terms, and within such reasonable time&quot;) in order to &quot;enlist their sympathies&quot; and thereby enlist them in the Confederate Army to secure Southern independence. Cleburne argued that emancipation did not have to include black equality, noting that &quot;necessity and wise legislation&quot; would ensure relations between blacks and whites would not materially change. This proposal was met with polite silence at the meeting, and while word of it leaked out, it went unremarked, much less officially recognized. From his letter outlining the proposal:

Cleburne&#x27;s proposal was vigorously attacked as an &quot;abolitionist conspiracy&quot; by General William H. T. Walker, who strongly supported slavery and also saw Cleburne as a rival for promotion. Walker eventually persuaded the commander of the Army of Tennessee, General Braxton Bragg, that Cleburne was politically unreliable and undeserving of further promotion. &quot;Three times in the summer of 1863 he was passed over for corps commander and remained a division commander until his death.&quot;

==Death and legacy==

Prior to the campaigning season of 1864, Cleburne became engaged to Susan Tarleton of Mobile, Alabama. Their marriage was never to be, as Cleburne was killed during an ill-conceived assault (which he opposed) on Union fortifications at the Battle of Franklin, just south of Nashville, Tennessee, on November 30, 1864. He was last seen, after his horse was shot out from under him, advancing with his sword raised on foot toward the Union line. Accounts later said that he was found just inside the Union line, and his body was carried back to a field hospital along the Columbia Turnpike. Confederate war records indicate he died either of a bullet to the abdomen, or possibly through his heart. When Confederates found his body, he had been picked clean of any valuable items, including his sword, boots, and pocket watch.

According to a letter written to General Cheatham from Judge Mangum after the war, Cleburne&#x27;s remains were first laid to rest at Rose Hill Cemetery in Columbia, Tennessee. At the urging of Army Chaplain Bishop Quintard, Judge Mangum, staff officer to Cleburne and his law partner in Helena, Cleburne&#x27;s remains were moved to St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church near Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, where they remained for six years. He had first observed St. John&#x27;s during the Army of Tennessee&#x27;s march into Tennessee during the campaign that led to the Battle of Franklin, and commented that it was the place he would like to be buried because of its great beauty and resemblance to his Irish homeland. In 1870, he was disinterred and returned to his adopted hometown of Helena, Arkansas, with much fanfare, and buried in the Confederate section of Maple Hill Cemetery, overlooking the Mississippi River.

William J. Hardee, Cleburne&#x27;s former corps commander, had this to say when he learned of his loss: &quot;Where this division defended, no odds broke its line; where it attacked, no numbers resisted its onslaught, save only once; and there is the grave of Cleburne.&quot;

Several geographic features are named after Patrick Cleburne, including Cleburne County in Alabama and Arkansas, and the city of Cleburne, Texas (which also features a statue of Patrick), though natives of the town call it &quot;Klee-burn.&quot; The location where he was killed in Franklin was reclaimed by preservationists, and is now known as Cleburne Park. Though the small monument in the park is often perceived as a monument to Cleburne, it actually is a marker to show where the Carter Family Cotton Gin once stood (the gin being an integral part of the Battle of Franklin, and the Carter House itself being the headquarters of Union Brigadier General Jacob D. Cox).

The Patrick R. Cleburne Confederate Cemetery is a memorial cemetery in Jonesboro, Georgia, which was named in honor of General Patrick Cleburne.

During a 1994 interview (00:40:20) on Book TV, when asked his favorite &quot;Civil War character&quot; by C-SPAN&#x27;s Brian Lamb, author Shelby Foote says: &quot;It&#x27;s easy to state who your favorites are because they&#x27;re many people&#x27;s favorites — Robert E. Lee, U.S. Grant, Stonewall Jackson, Tecumseh Sherman. But I have some favorites that are grievously neglected. One of them is an Arkansas general named Pat Cleburne, Patrick Ronayne Cleburne, from Arkansas [sic]. And he probably was the best division commander on either side, and in his day — he was killed at Franklin about a year before the end of the war — he was called the Stonewall Jackson of the West and well-known and adored by his men. He&#x27;s been largely forgotten today. He&#x27;s buried right there at Helena [Arkansas] where Crowley&#x27;s Ridge comes to the Mississippi. I&#x27;m very fond of Cleburne. I got the same reaction at Cleburne&#x27;s death that his men got. I was greatly saddened to lose him. You get a great fondness for these people or a severe dislike for them, and if you have a dislike for them, you lean over backward hoping not to let it show. I&#x27;m sure it does.&quot;
